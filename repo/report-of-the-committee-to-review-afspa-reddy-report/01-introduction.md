/c INTRODUCTION

/s Background

In the wake of the intense agitation launched by various
civil society groups in Manipur following the death of Kr. Th.
Manorama Devi on 11.7.2004 while in the custody of the Assam
Rifles, and the earlier indefinite fast undertaken by Ms. Irom
Sharmila since 2001 demanding repeal of the Armed Forces
(Special Powers) Act, 1958 (hereinafter referred to AFSPA), the
Union Home Minister visited Manipur in September 2004 and
reviewed the situation with the officers of the State Govt. and the
Security/Intelligence agencies. During this visit Apunba Lup and
many delegations and citizen groups raised a demand for
revocation of the AFSPA. There were other groups who
demanded a review of the Act or favoured retaining the Act.
During the visit of the Prime Minister to Manipur in November
2004, several organizations including the Apunba Lup and many
other individuals met the Prime Minister with similar pleas. The
Prime Minister assured them that the Central Govt. would
consider their demand sympathetically.

2. The Central Government, accordingly, set up a 5-Member
   Committee (vide Ministry of Home Affairs Office Order No.
   11011/97/2004-NE-III dated 19th November, 2004 - Copy at
   Annexure-I) under the Chairmanship of Justice B.P. Jeevan
   Reddy, former Judge of the Supreme Court with the following
   four Members :---

(b) Shri .P. Shrivastav,IAS(Retd), FormerSpecial Secretary,MHA
(c) Lt Gen (Retd) V.R. Raghavan, Former DGMO.
(d) Shri Sanjoy Hazarika, Journalist.

3. The terms of reference for the Committee are as follows:
   "Keeping in view the legitimate concerns of the people of
   the North Eastern Region, the need to foster Human Rights,
   keeping in perspective the imperatives of security and
   maintenance of public order to review the provisions of the
   Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 as amended in 1972
   and to advise the Govt. of India whether ---

groups, State Governments and concerned agencies of Central
Govt./State Govt. legal experts and individuals, as deemed
necessary by the Committee in connection with the review of the
Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 as amended in 1972.

The Committee will meet as often as required and visit the
North Eastern region, if felt necessary".

Deliberations of the Committee and its interaction with
stakeholders:

4. The Committee held its first meeting on 24.11.2004 and
   second meeting on 26.11.2004 and deliberated on its terms of
   reference of the Committee and procedure to be followed for its
   work. In its third meeting held on 8.12.2004, it was decided to
   call for representations from the general public. A notice was
   published in all the national dailies and regional papers on
   10.12.2004, which, inter-alia read as under :---

"The Committee has decided to call for representations on
whether it should be recommend to the Government of India to:

consonance with the obligations of the government towards
protection of Human Rights. or

The Committee invites individuals, organisations, parties,
institutions and all non-governmental organisations interested in
the issue to send their responses within 30 days at the above

The Committee proposes to visit the North-East beginning with
Manipur on 27th December, 2004. The timings and venue of the
meetings of the Committee shall be intimated later. All those

5. The office and other infrastructure of the Committee came up
   much later during the last week of December 2004. The
   Committee paid its first visit to Imphal (Manipur) from December
   27 to 30,2004. A section of Apunba Lup had given a call to
   boycott the visit of the Committee. Despite the boycott call, a
   large number of individuals, groups, organizations and lawyers
   appeared before the Committee and expressed their views on
   the AFSPA freely. The GOC 17 Mountain Div. Imphal also gave a
   detailed presentation on the existence of various militant under-
   ground outfits and the role of the Army in containing the
   insurgency. He justified the powers and protection given to the
   Armed Forces under the AFSPA.

6. During the second visit of the Committee to Manipur, it
   visited the hill districts of Manipur viz. Senapati and
   Churachandpur on April, 20 to 23,2005. At these hearings,
   representatives of Nagas, Kukis, Zomis, Paites, and other. ethnic
   groups appeared before the Committee and made written and
   oral submissions.

7. The Committee visited Agartala in Tripura on February 8,
2005. A few groups appeared and represented their views.

8. In Assam, a large number of people holding different shades
   of opinion appeared before the Committee at Guwahati on Feb. 9
   & 10, 2005. Groups of Lawyers, University students, individuals
   and some tribal groups appeared before the Committee, seeking
   the repeal of the Act. At Dibrugarh (April 24/25, 2005), scholars
   and teachers from the Dibrugarh University as well as
   professionals and business representatives expressed their views
   favouring repeal of the Act.

9. In Meghalaya, (Shillong Feb. 11,2005), the Director
   General Assam Rifles, gave a presentation on the need for
   retaining the AFSPA. A few citizen groups and individuals
   appeared at the hearings and expressed their views. The Act is
   applicable only in a 20-Kilometer belt along the Assam border as
   per the notification issued by the Central Government.

10. In Nagaland (Kohima - March 21 & 22, 2005), the Civil
    Society groups which appeared before the Committee strongly
    demanded the repeal of the Act. The Naga Hills (then in Assam)
    was the first area to which the Act was applied in the year 1958
    to tackle insurgency. Several senior officials of the State
    Government appeared and asked for the repeal of the Act.
    Earlier on March 21, the DIG-Assam Rifles briefed the Committee
    on the current situation in the State and favoured the retention
    of the Act.

11. In Arunachal Pradesh (Khonsa April 25, 2005), the
    Commandant of the Assam Rifles and the Supdt. Of Police of
    Tirap district recommended the retention of the Act, which was
    applicable only to the two eastern districts of Tirap and
    Changlang, which have been declared as "disturbed areas". A
    senior police official expressed his view that some areas of Lohit
    district should also be brought under the purview of the Act.

12. The Committee organized public hearings at Delhi (Jan. 19-
    21, 2005) where a large number of individuals, groups, NGOs
    and Human Rights' groups appeared before it. Most of them
    demanded the repeal of the Act. In addition, the Committee was
    briefed by the Army Headquarters Delhi on 7.3.2005 by HQ
    Eastern Command (Kolkata) on Feb. 7, 2005), and by H.Q. BSF
    on May 7. 2005). The DG, CRPF, conveyed views of the
    organization on January 21, 2005. All these Forces favoured the
    retention of the Act or, at any rate, to provide a legal mechanism
    defining their powers during such operation and to provide for
    necessary safeguards. Four State Governments, viz. Assam,
    Arunachal Pradesh. Meghalaya and Mizoram also conveyed their
    views in writing. While the Governments of Assam and Arunachal
    Pradesh favoured the retention of the Act, the other two State
    Governments felt that there is no need for the Act any more.

13. The Committee held 13 meetings, 17 public hearings and
    received briefings from 7 State agencies on the Act. In all, 54
    individuals, 51 organizations and 5 political parties submitted
    their views to the Committee at various public hearings. There
    were 169 men and 27 women who appeared before the
    Committee at various places in the North-East and at New Delhi.
    We must say that while an overwhelming majority of the citizen
    groups and individuals pleaded for repeal of the Act, they were
    firmly of the view at the same time, that the Army should remain
    to fight the insurgents. When explained that the continuance of
    Army's operations would require a legal mechanism, quite a few
    of them agreed but suggested that such a mechanism should
    duly take into account the need to protect the rights and
    interests of citizens as also of the State. Factual data regarding
    the meetings, hearings and representations made by individuals,
    Civil Society groups, Human Rights organizations,etc. is available
    at Annexure II.
