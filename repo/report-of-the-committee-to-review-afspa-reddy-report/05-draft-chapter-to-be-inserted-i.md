/c CHAPTER-IV

/s Other Statutory. Provisions providing for assistance to  Armed Forces.

Chapter 10 of the Criminal Procedure Code deals with
'maintenance of public order and tranquility'. Part A of the
Chapter deals with 'unlawful assemblies'. Section 129 empowers
the Executive Magistrate or the officer-in-charge of a police
station and any officer not below the rank of a Sub Inspector to
command an unlawful assembly to disperse and if such unlawful
assembly does not so disperse, he may use such force as may be
necessary for dispersing it. The named authorities are also
empowered to arrest and confine persons in order to disperse
such unlawful assembly.
2. Section 130 provides for use of armed forces to disperse
unlawful assemblies, while Section 131 sets out the powers of
and the procedure to be followed by the armed forces' while
dispersing unlawful assemblies. Section 130 and 131 read as
follows:

> _Section 130_. Power of certain armed force officers to disperse
> assembly.
> 
> (1) If any such assembly cannot be otherwise dispersed,
> and if it is necessary for the public security that it should be
> dispersed, the Executive Magistrate of the highest rank who is
> present may cause it to be dispersed by the armed forces.
> 
> (2) Such Magistrate may require any officer in command of
> any group of persons belonging to the armed forces to disperse
> the assembly with the help of the armed forces under his
> command, and to arrest and confine such persons forming part of
> it as the Magistrate may direct, or as it may be necessary to
> arrest and confine in order to disperse the assembly or to have
> them punished according to law.
> 
> (3) Every such officer of the armed forces shall obey such
> requisition in such manner as he thinks fit, but in so doing he
> shall use as little force, and do as little injury to person and
> property, as may be consistent with dispersing the assembly and
> arresting and detaining such persons.
> 
> _Section 131_. Protection against prosecution for acts done under
> preceding sections.
3. When the public security is manifestly endangered by any
such assembly and no Executive Magistrate can be
communicated with, any Commissioned or Gazetted Officer of the
armed forces may disperse such assembly with the help of the
armed forces under his command, and may arrest and confine
any persons forming part of it in order to disperse such assembly
or that they may be punished according to law; but if, while he is
acting under this section, it becomes practicable for him to
communicate with an Executive Magistrate, he shall do so, and
shall thenceforward obey the instructions of the Magistrate, as to
whether he shall or shall not continue such action."
4. According to section 130, if the unlawful assembly cannot
be dispersed by the officer mentioned in section 130(1) with the
forces under his command, and it is necessary to disperse such
unlawful assembly in the interest of public security, the Executive
Magistrate of the highest rank who is present at the spot, is
empowered to direct the armed forces to disperse it. Sub
Section (2) elucidates the power under sub-section (1); it
provides that such Magistrate may require any officer in
command of armed forces to disperse such unlawful assembly
with the help of the forces under his command, and to arrest and
confine such persons as he may direct or as may be necessary
for the purpose of such dispersal. Sub section (3) declares that
an officer of the armed forces, whose services are requisitioned
by the Magistrate, shall obey such requisition but the manner in
which he carries out the task given to him, is left to him, with the
rider that while dispersing the unlawful assembly, he shall use as
little force as the circumstances warrant and cause as little injury
to person or property as possible consistent with the
circumstances of the situation, The same rider applies even
while arresting or detaining the members of the unlawful
assembly.
5. Section 130, in our opinion, clearly lays down and affirms
the supremacy of the civil power in the matter of maintenance of
public order; it requires the officers of the armed forces, whose
help is requisitioned by the Magistrate to obey such requisition;
of course, the manner in which he should do the task entrusted
to him is left to him; even there, there is the requirement of
using as little force as possible and cause as little injury to person
or property as possible, in the circumstances of the case. These
features of this section, in our considered opinion, are highly
welcome and salutary provisions, the absence of which could lead
to arbitrariness and capricious behaviour - which may in fact give
rise to another kind of problem while subduing one kind of
problem.
6. Section 131 provides for a situation different from the one
envisaged by Section 130, namely a situation where the public
security is manifestly endangered by any such unlawful assembly
and no Executive Magistrate can be communicated with. In such
a situation, any Commissioned Officer or Gazetted Officer of the
armed forces is empowered to disperse such unlawful assembly
with the help of the forces under his command and for the said
purpose; he is also empowered to confine any person who is a
member of such unlawful assembly. At the same time, the
section takes care to provide that while so acting, if it becomes
practicable for the officer of such armed forces to communicate
with the Executive Magistrate, he shall do so and thenceforward
obey the instructions of the Magistrate as to whether he shall, or
shall not, continue such action. This section is indicative of the
concern of the Parliament that the armed forces shall not act on
their own while dispersing unlawful assemblies except where the
situation is grave (manifestly endangering public security) and no
Magistrate can be communicated with. These sections and the
concern exhibited by them may be contrasted with the blanket
powers given by Section 4 under the Armed Forces (Special
Powers) Act, 1958, recognizing at the same time that Section
130 and 131 contemplate a temporary local phenomenon and not
a long term insurgency or terrorism spread over a large
geographic area.
7. Section 132 provides protection to the persons acting under
section 129, 130 and 131 against any proceedings in a criminal
court. It states that no proceedings can be instituted against any
such person except with the sanction of the Central Government
where the person to be proceeded against is a member of the
armed forces and with the sanction of the State Government
where the persons to be proceeded against is member of any
other force. This section also expressly provides that no person
acting under sections 129, 130 and 131 shall be deemed to have
committed any offence while acting under and in accordance with
the said provisions.
8. It is evident that sections 130 and 131 are meant to meet
situations where an unlawful assembly endangers the public
security. By way of illustration, we may refer to the anti-Sikh
riots following the assassination of late Prime Minister Smt. Indira
Gandhi or the situation arising consequent upon demolition of the
Babri Masjid, or communal riots. These are situations; it is
necessary to point out, where the authority of the State is not
challenged. These are situations, which arise unexpectedly or on
account of a sudden incident or event like the examples stated
above. Such situations must be distinguished from those arising
in the North Eastern States like Manipur, Nagaland or Assam
where the militants not only challenge the authority of the State
but by their composition, strength, aims and objectives present a
problem which is spread over a large geographical area and is
long term in nature. In situations of the latter kind, the
provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code would not be
adequate. A permanent legal provision would be required which
permits the army and the other Central forces to operate over an
extended area and time period - of course, consistent with the
rights and interests of the citizens and the security of the State.

9. We have kept the above facts and circumstances in mind
while examining the issues referred to us.

PART-III

/p FEED BACK RECEIVED BY THE COMMITTEE (REPRESENTATIONS, PUBLIC HEARINGS, ETC.)

/c CHAPTER-I

/s Manipur

The Committee, with a view to ascertain the views,
opinions in Manipur on the AFSPA and its implementation, issued
a notification calling for responses from the public. The
Committee visited the State of Manipur in the first instance. This
was for the reason that the latest upsurge against the AFSPA
took place in Manipur following the death of Ms.Th. Manorma
Devi while in the custody of the Assam Rifles. The visit to Imphal
took place on December 27-30, 2004 and the hearings were held
in the premises of the Manipur Human Rights Commission. The
Chairman of MHRC, Justice (Retd.) W.A. Shishak was kind
enough to make necessary arrangements for our hearings.
2. There was a _bandh_ called by a faction of the Apunba Lup,
which demanded the immediate repeal of AFSPA, when the
Committee was in the State. Despite that, many groups,
individuals and organizations made depositions before the
Committee. The family of Manorama Devi also met the
Committee. The list of individuals and groups who made
representations to the Committee is at Annexure-III. From the
views expressed before us and from the representations
received, the following distinct view-points emerged:

(a)The dominant view-point expressed by a large number of
organizations/individuals was that the Act is undemocratic, harsh
and discriminatory. It is applicable only to the North-Eastern
States and, therefore, discriminates against the people of the
region. Under the protection provided by the Act, several illegal
killings, torture, molestations, rapes and extortions have taken
place particularly since the Act does not provide for or create a
machinery which provides protection against the excesses
committed by armed forces/para-military forces deployed in the
State. The Act should, therefore, be repealed. The Committee
specifically put questions to the persons who appeared before it
whether they wanted both the Act and the Army to go, or
whether they want only the Act to go but the Army to remain. To
this question, the overwhelming response was that while the Act
should be repealed, the Army should remain to fight the militants
and guard the borders.

(b) A certain view-point voiced by some persons was that both
the Act and the Army should be removed from Manipur.
According to them, the problem in Manipur is essentially a socio-
economic one and not of law and order. If the basic issues of
socio-economic and of political nature are attended, it would not
be necessary to have the presence of the Army in the State.

(c) A different view-point voiced by a few elderly persons and
associations was that both the Act and the Army should remain in
the interest of and for ensuring the safety of small ethnic groups
and other minorities.
3. The Committee gathered the impression that there is a
certain amount of confusion in the minds of many citizens
regarding the respective powers of the State police organizations
and that of the armed forces of the Union. They are under the
impression that the State Police Forces were also acting under
the protection of the Act. As a consequence, the excesses
committed by the State Police and Commandos are generally laid
at the door of the Act.
4. Certain organizations filed elaborate lists of alleged
atrocities committed by the security forces and in particular
against the members of the Assam Rifles. These lists also cite
instances of killing of innocents, including women and children.
This material, being too bulky, is not enclosed to the Report but
is sent to the Government along with this Report for such use as
may be found appropriate by the concerned authorities. It was
also brought to our notice that in several cases of alleged
excesses, enquires were held by competent authorities and the
guilty personnel awarded punishment and compensation was also
given to the aggrieved persons in some cases.
5. The current situation in Manipur is a complex amalgam of
factors. There are longstanding animosities among ethnic, tribal,
plains and hill groups. The Meitei people who constitute the
majority in the State have a deeply felt historical perspective of
Manipuri territorial and cultural unity. The nexus between crime
and politics on one hand, and foreign involvement through funds,
arms, and sanctuaries on the other, make for a highly volatile
security situation. Over the years, the nature of insurgency has -
as elsewhere in the North East --- shifted to acts of terrorism,
extortion, coercion of the population giving rise to a situation of
internal disorder. In the last two decades the numbers of militant
groups, their arsenals and lethality have grown immensely. The
situation, it appears, cannot be managed by the State law and
order machinery as at present. The Army and other Central
forces may continue to play a major role in the security
management of Manipur, tiil the political process and socio-
economic measures begin to take effect and the governance in
the State improves.
6. The Committee is also of the opinion that there is a
deliberate and carefully planned attempt by militant organizations
to damage the reputation and morale of the Armed Forces. The
requirement therefore is to ensure that the powers of the army to
conduct operations against militant organizations remain while at
the same time, ensuring that these operations do not impinge
upon the rights and the safety of the citizens.

/s Hill Districts of Manipur

/ss Senapati

7. The Committee also visited the hill-districts of the State
and held hearings at Senapati and Churachandpur on April 21
and April 23, 2005
8. At Senapati the various Naga organizations had met earlier
and discussed the issue in detail, exchanged views amongst
themselves and made out a common written representation on
behalf of the Naga Peoples' Organisation. However, as many as
11 representatives of the Civil Society groups made oral
presentations. Three more written representations were also
handed over.
9. Initially, however, they said that they would not be
satisfied with 'review'. Their demand was nothing short of repeal
of the Act. It was explained to them on behalf of the Committee
that Review was a very wide term and included repeal also. They
were quite satisfied with this clarification. They made a grievance
that though the Nagas had been suffering and complaining
against the Act for almost 50 years, nothing was done until the
Manorama Devi incident in Imphal prompted the Govt. of India to
set up this Committee.

/ss Churachandpur

10. Six written representations were received by the
Committee at Churachandpur on behalf of the organizations
representing the Kukis, Zomis, Paites, Koirengs (Korens) and
others on April 23, 2005. Representatives of four organizations (a
total of 17 persons) appeared for oral hearings.
11. The views expressed at Churachandpur were qualitatively
different from those received from elsewhere in the State. One
view was in favour of replacement of the Act by a _more effective_
law so that peace and harmony could be restored in the State.
some others wanted that the Act should not be lifted from
Churachandpur area where the people were the major victims at
the hands of underground outfits, as a result of which
development work had come to a standstill. One view was that
the Army should stay but the excesses committed by them
should be stopped. Only one organization was in favour of
complete withdrawal of AFSPA.

/c CHAPTER-II

/s Tripura

The Committee visited Agartala( Tripura) on February 8, 2005. The representatives of Twipra Students Federation, Borok
Peoples Human Rights Organization, Indigenous Nationalist Party
of Tripura and the Tripura Pradesh Congress Committee met the
Committee.
2. We must mention at the outset that a misconception was
prevailing among the people who appeared before us viz. that
the state security forces are also covered by the Act and are
entitled to exercise all the powers and enjoy the immunities
provided by it. The Committee sought to erase this impression
stating that the Act has no application to the Tripura State
security forces but only to the armed forces and other
paramilitary forces of the Union. Be that as it may, the
representatives of the three first mentioned organizations
complained of excesses and atrocities said to have been
iommitted by the Tripura security forces and requested for the
repeal of the Act. They also made a fervent plea that the influx of
Bangladeshis into Tripura should be stopped lest the tribal
population of the state is further marginalised.
3. The representatives of Tripura Pradesh Congress
Committee, however, took an opposite stand. They submitted
that since there is no let up in the insurgency, the Act should
continue. They complained that militants were targeting peaceful
citizens. They suggested that with a view to check excesses
committed by the security forces, there should be a mechanism
to give exemplary punishment to the guilty among them. They
also submitted that the SPOs appointed by the state government
were indeed fleeing with arms and joining militant groups.
4. The Hon'ble Chief Minister met the Committee. He brought
to our notice that neither the army nor any of the armed forces
controlled by the Central govt. are deployed in the state, barring
a few units of the Assam Rifles. Predominantly, it is the state
security forces that are dealing with insurgent activities. He
pointed out that there were no complaints of atrocities against
Assam Rifles in this State.
5. The main problem emphasized by the Administration
relates to the illegal immigration of Bangladeshis and the
presence of a large number of camps along the Tripura border,
within Bangladesh territory, where insurgents were being
provided with funds, arms, ammunition and refuge.
6. We must also point out that the Act is enforced only in the
hill district of the State, viz. the Tripura Tribal Autonomous
District Council, and not in the entire State. The list of individuals
and groups and a gist of their submissions is placed at Annexure-
IV.

/c CHAPTER-III

/s Assam

To ascertain the views and opinions of the people of Assam,
the Committee visited Guwahati on February 9 and 10, 2005. A
large number of Lawyers and a good number of representatives
of civil society organizations expressed their views. The list of
individuals and organization who appeared before the Committee
and the gist of their submissions is placed at Annexure.
Overwhelming view was that the Act should be repealed. The
Committee was impressed, particularly by the representation
made by Shri T.C. Mazumdar, Sr. Advocate and former Member
of Rajya Sabha (accompanied by two other advocates of
Guwahati) relating his personal experience. While traveling from
Guwahati to Tezpur in Assam, his car was stopped enroute by the
members of the armed forces. He was asked to get down from
the car and surrender the car to them. Mr. Mazumdar says, he
told them that he is a heart patient having undergone heart
surgery and that in view of his old age and health; he should be
allowed to proceed to the nearest town, wherefrom they could
take his car. But his request was rejected and the car was taken
away, leaving him high and dry on the highway. He strongly
urged for the repeal of the Act. He opined that Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act, which is in force in the entire country,
is adequate to meet the militant activities and there is absolutely
no necessity to have the AFSPA. We also heard similar
complaints from an Advocate, (a retired Sessions Judge). The
President of the Lawyers Association, Guwahati, and several
other advocates pleaded for the repeal. However, one advocate
who is now a counsel for Central Govt. took a different line and
asked for dilution of the Act to accord with the human rights.
2. Some students of Post Graduate courses in Guwahati
University also pleaded for the repeal of the Act. This was also
the refrain of the representatives of North-East Net-Work,
Guwahati, Assam Pradesh Mahila Society, Assam Jatiyabadi
Yuva-Chhatra Parishad, Manab Adhikar Sangram Samiti,
Guwahati and KARBI Tehnical Unemployed Youth Association
and KARBI Youth Organisation. BMSS (Bishnupriya Manipuri
Samaj Sanstha, Guwahati) pleaded that the interests of
Bishnupriya Manipuris should be protected while reviewing and
modifying AFSPA.
3. Guwahati High Court Bar Association, Nagarik Mancha,
Guwahati, Socialist Unity Centre of India uniformly complained of
the excesses allegedly committed by the Assam Rifles and other
Armed Forces, taking advantage of the immunity granted by the
Act.
4. When the committee questioned the above persons
whether they want the Army also to leave Assam (besides asking
for repeal of the Act), two strands of opinion emerged. One
opinion was that Army should also be withdrawn (except from the
borders) while the other was that while the Act should go, the
army should remain to fight insurgency and further that there
should be an adequate legal mechanism to provide for and
regulate the operations of the armed forces.
5. Contrary views were expressed by the Commissioner &
Secretary to the Govt. of Assam (Home and Political Department)
who stated that the entire State of Assam was declared as a
"disturbed area" by the Central Govt. on 27.11.1990, in view of
the prevailing dangerous situation arising out of the activities of
ULFA. He stated that since 20.8.1997, the Govt. of India has
been reviewing the extension of the Act every six months and
the last extension was ordered on 4.11.2004 up to 3.5.2005. He
stated further that ULFA and NDFB had, of late, increased
targeting civilians and Security Forces. He stated that though
some militant groups, including NDFB have come forward for
negotiations, ULFA still remains defiant and continues to harp
upon sovereignty. In conclusion, he stated that the Act continues
to be a critical requirement for curbing counter insurgency
operations under a unified command and should therefore
continue.
6. DIG, CISF, Guwahati submitted a two-page written
representation to the Committee. He requested that the powers
conferred upon CRPF and BSF should also be conferred upon the
CISF.

/s Dibrugarh

The Committee also visited Dibrugarh in Assam on April 24
and 25 for hearings and discussions. It received a representation
from the Sadou Asom Mottock Yuba-Chhatra Sanmilan, which
called for the repeal of the Act on the ground that innocent
people had been harassed and harmed by it.
7. The Committee had an extensive discussion with about 31
scholars, lawyers and representatives of business at Dibrugarh
University. The Vice Chancellor was also present. The basic
theme underlying the discussion was that the Act should be
repealed because it was discriminatory and anti-people. A few
speakers suggested that there should be a grievance redressal
and review mechanism to give basic information about detained
persons to the families of the victims.

/c CHAPTER-IV

/s Meghalaya

To ascertain the views and opinions of the stakeholders in
Meghalaya, the Committee visited Shillong on 11.2.2005. It must
be mentioned that the Act is in force only in the 20 Kilometers
belt along the border of this state with Assam; it is not in force in
the entire State. No complaints of excesses or other wrongful
activities on the part of the Armed Forces was brought to the
notice of the Committee. Even so, the Committee held its
hearings and the following is the condensed version of the
representations received by the Committee.
2. DG, Assam Rifles, Shillong gave a detailed presentation on
the Assani Rifles. he explained the role of Assam Rifles in the
North-Eastern States and their deployment in each State. He
justified the retention of AFSPA saying that it would be difficult
for the Armed Forces to work without any legal protection. The
guidelines given by the Supreme Court could also be included in
the new legislation.
3. Govt. of Meghalaya, Shillong represented by Shri
A.Pradhan, Addl. DG of Police and Shri Marbanjang. AIG of Police
mentioned that the State Govt. has not enforced this Act in
Meghalaya since its birth in 1972. However, the Union Govt. in
its notification dated 27.11.1990 has declared 20 kilometers wide
belt in the State of Meghalaya bordering Assam as a disturbed
area under Section 3 of the Act.
4. Dino D.G. Dympep, Secretary-General, Meghalya People's
Human Rights Council handed over a written representation to
the Committee, stating that AFSPA has failed to contain
insurgency situation and that there are other Acts already in
force like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 ( which
has been amended in 2004 equipping it to deal with terrorism)
which are sufficient to deal with militancy.
5. An interaction was held at the North Eastern Hill University
with faculty members, presided over by the Vice Chancellor Dr.
Mrinal Miri, where a large number of academicians participated,
spoke against the Act and the need to end discriminatory
treatment.
6. A list of individuals and organizations who met the Committee
at Shillong is placed at Annexure-VI.
