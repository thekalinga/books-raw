/c CHAPTER II

Article 355 of the Constitution places an obligation upon the
Union of India to protect every State "against external aggression
and internal disturbance and to ensure that the government of
every State is carried on in accordance with the provisions of this
Constitution. Prior to the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act,
Article 355 was relevant both for the purpose of Article 352 as
well as Article 356. Under Article 352 (as it obtained prior to the
said Amendment Act), "the President, if satisfied that a grave
emergency exists whereby the security of India or any part of the
territory thereof is threatened, whether by war or external
aggression or _internal disturbance_," he could, by issuing a
proclamation, make a declaration to that effect. In short, he
could proclaim emergency and assume the powers mentioned in
the said Article. The expressions 'external aggression' and
'internal disturbance' were common to both Article 355 and
Article 352. Similarly, if the Government of a State was not
carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution,
the President could take action under Article 356 and assume to
himself the powers of the government of that State and exercise
other powers mentioned in that Article. However, by Constitution
(44th Amendment) Act, the expression 'internal disturbance' in
Article 352 (1) was substituted by the expression armed
rebellion'. With this the connection between Articles 355 and 352
got snapped partially. In other words, in case the security of
India or a part thereof is threatened by internal disturbance in a
State, the power under Article 352 may not be available. Even
so, the obligation of the Union government to protect every State
from internal disturbance remains; it is now an independent
obligation to be performed in such a manner as the Union
government thinks appropriate.

2. By the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, the Parliament
   brought in the following provisions/amendments, which are
   relevant to our purpose. Article 257A was introduced providing
   for assistance to States by deployment of armed forces or other
   forces of the Union. The said Article, which was deleted by the
   Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, read as follows:

   >257 - _Assistance to States by deployment of armed forces or
   >other forces of the Union._ ---
   >
   >(1) The Government of India may
   >deploy any armed force of the Union or any other force subject to
   >the control of the Union for dealing with any grave situation of
   >law and order in any State.
   > 
   >(2) Any armed force or other force of any contingent or unit
   >thereof deployed under clause (1) in any State shall act in
   >accordance with such directions as the Government of India may
   >issue and shall not, save as otherwise provided in such
   >directions, be subject to the superintendence or control of the
   >State Government or any officer or authority subordinate to the
   >State Government.
   > 
   >(3) Parliament may, by law, specify the powers, functions,
   >privileges and liabilities of the members of any force or any
   >contingent or unit thereof deployed under clause (1) during the
   >period of such deployment."

3. Along with Article 257A, Parliament had also introduced
   Entry 2A in the Union List in the Seventh Schedule to the
   Constitution. This entry, however, has not been deleted by the
   Constitution (44th Amendment) Act. It reads as follows:

>2-A. Deployment of any armed force of the Union or any other
force subject to the control of the Union or any contingent or unit
thereof in any State in aid of the civil power, powers, jurisdiction,
privileges and liabilities of the members of such forces while on
such deployment.

Entry 1 in List II (State List) read as follows before the
Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act:
>(1) 'Public order' (but not including the use of naval, military or
air force or any other armed force of the Union in aid of the civil
power)

By the said Amendment, however, the said Entry was amended
to read as follows:

>(1) 'Public order' (but not including the use of any naval, military
or air force or any other armed force of the Union _or of any other
force subject to the control of the Union or of any contingent or
unit thereof_ in aid of civil power)

4. It may be noticed that Entry 2A in the Union List does not
   refer to or use the expression 'public order'. Indeed, Article 257A
   contemplated Government of India deploying the armed forces of
   the Union for "dealing with any grave situation of law and order
   in any State" --- a grave encroachment into the domain reserved
   to the States under the Constitution. (Under the Constitution,
   law and order as well as public order are both within the
   exclusive province of the States. Even where the armed forces of
   the Union are deployed in aid of the civil power of the State to
   maintain public order --- whether on the basis of a request for
   such armed forces from the State or whether such deployment is
made by the Union government acting under a law made under
Entry 2 A of the Union List, the law and order and public order
yet remain within the domain of the States.) In fact Article 257A
did not use the words "in aid of civil power" though the said
words were used in Entry 24 which was simultaneously
introduced in the Union List. Of course, these words were there
in Entry 1 of the State List even prior to the Constitution (42nd
Amendment) Act and they remain even now. In this connection,
one must bear in mind the difference between the concepts 'law
and order', 'public order', 'internal disturbance' and 'armed
rebellion' --- all the expressions employed by our Constitution, as
pointed out hereinabove.

5. The aforementioned provisions are mentioned with a view
   to clarify certain issues relevant to this Report. The first question
   is, is there a distinction between "public order" (State List, item
   1) and "internal disturbance" referred to in Article 355? For this
   purpose we have to examine the meaning and content of both
   the expressions. As pointed out by the Supreme Court in the
   case of Ram Manohar Lohia (1966 S.C), "aw and order" is a
   larger circle within which public order constitutes a smaller
   circle.(The concept of "security of the State" was said to be a yet
   another smaller circle within public order-'concentric circles'. This
   was so held in the context of the language in the then prevailing
   Preventive Detention law). For example, a simple murder is a law
   and order problem but where a murder is committed on
   communal grounds, which is meant to or designed to create a
   fear and a feeling of insecurity in one or more communities, it
   becomes a 'public order' issue. A communal clash is a 'public
   order' problem but where, say, the communal clashes take place
   on a large scale, affecting an entire State or a part of the State,
   paralyzing the administration, it would be a case of "internal
   disturbance". Now, coming to the meaning and content of the
   expression "internal disturbance", it is necessary to turn to
   Constituent Assembly debates, in the absence of a judicial
   pronouncement.

6. We may first refer to the speech of Dr B.R.Ambedkar in the
   Constituent Assembly, explaining the principle behind Article 355.
   He said:
   >When once the Constitution makes the provinces sovereign and gives
   them plenary powers to make any law for the peace, order and good
   government of the province, really speaking, the intervention of the Centre or
   any other authority must be deemed to be barred, because that would be an
   invasion of the sovereign authority of the province. That is a fundamental
   proposition which we must accept by reason of the fact that we have a Federal
   Constitution. That being so, if the Centre is to interfere in the administration of
   provincial affairs, it must be by and under some obligation, which the
   Constitution imposes upon the Centre. [The] article. ...says that it shall be the
   duty of the Union to protect every unit ..... Similar clauses appear in the
   American Constitution. They also occur in the Australian Constitution where
   the Constitution, in express terms, provides that it shall be the duty of the
   Central Government to protect the units or the States from external
   aggression or internal commotion. All that we propose to do is to add one
   more clause to the principle enunciated in the American and Australian
   Constitutions, namely, that it shall be the duty of the Union to maintain the
   Constitution in the provinces as enacted by this law. (C.A.D.Vol. IX. P.133)

7. The provisions of the American and Australian
   Constitutions, which Dr. Ambedkar referred to, may also be set
   out for a clear understanding of the meaning of the expression
   'internal disturbance'. Article VI (4) of the US Constitution says
   "the United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a
   republican form of government and shall protect each of them
   against invasion and on application of the Legislature or of the
   Executive when the Legislature cannot be convened, against
   _domestic violence_". Similarly, Section 119 of the Australian
   Constitution Act says, "the Commonwealth shall protect every
   State against domestic _violence_". It would be seen that both the
   American and Australian Constitutions use the expression
   'domestic violence', though under the US Constitution, the
   federal government steps in the case of domestic violence only at
   the request of the State or Legislature of the State concerned. As
   against these provisions, Article 355 empowers the Union to act
   on its own i.e., without a request from the State Government, to
   protect the State from internal disturbance. We may refer in
   this connection to the speech of Sri Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar in
   the Constituent Assembly as well. Speaking upon this Article, Sri
   Alladi said: "Therefore, it is the duty of the Union Government to
   protect States against external aggression, internal disturbance
   and domestic chaos and to see that the Constitution is worked in
   a proper manner both in the States and in the Union" (C.A.D.
   Vol.IX.P.150). It would therefore be legitimate for us to infer that
   the expression 'internal disturbance' means 'internal commotion'
   (the expression used by Dr Ambedkar in the above speech)
   'domestic violence' (expression used in both the American and
   Australian Constitutions) and 'domestic chaos' (the expression
   used by Sri Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar in the Constituent
   Assembly during the debate on the said Article.

8. It therefore follows that every 'public order' problem does
   not necessarily amount to "internal disturbance" while the
   converse may be true i.e., in case of 'internal disturbance', public
   order is bound to be affected. The duty and power of the Central
   Government under Article 355 comes into play only in case of
   "internal disturbance" i.e., 'domestic chaos' or 'internal
   commotion'. The said power is not available in each and every
   problem of public order. "Internal disturbance" means failure of
   public order on a large scale and in a sustained manner, for
   whatever reason it may be, affecting the entire State or part of
   the State. The expression "internal disturbance" itself is
   expressive of the level of disturbance, chaos and commotion it
   contemplates. It must be remembered that prior to the 44th
   Amendment, 'internal disturbance' was one of the grounds on
   which the President could proclaim emergency under Art. 352.
   This consideration also induces to hold that "internal disturbance"
   connotes disturbances on a large, on a sustained and serious
   level and is distinct and different from issues of public order
   which arise from time to time in one or the other place, village,
   town or city of a State. In the latter type of cases, it is for the
   State Government to tackle it. It is for the State Government to
   decide, in a given case, whether it requires the help of armed
   forces/para-military forces of the Union to help tackle it. Indeed,
   if it is of a purely local level, the Executive Magistrate (of the
   highest rank) can deal with it under Section 130 of the Code of
   Criminal Procedure.

9. The above distinction between the "public order" in entry 1
   of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and
   "internal disturbance" referred to in Article 355 has to be kept in
   mind and observed, in the interest of preserving the federal
   character of our Constitution and to ensure that the field
   reserved to the States under our Constitution is not trenched
   upon by the Centre. Article 257-A was a serious, and an
   unbelievable encroachment upon the powers of the State (Dr.
   Ambedkar referred to them as the sovereign and plenary powers
   of the States) and it is good that it was repealed soon enough.

10. In this connection, it is relevant to point out that entry 2A in the Union List
   speaks of deployment of the armed forces of the Union in any State in aid of
   civil power but it does not speak of or refer to "public order”. It only
   empowers the Union to make a law providing for such deployment and their
   powers and procedures. It does not and cannot trench upon the power and
   province of the States to maintain public order. It is important to notice how
   entry 1 in the State List reads: "1. Public Order (but not including the use of
   the army, naval, military or air force ... in aid of civil power)". It means
   that the State cannot make a law with respect to the deployment of the armed
   forces, while it can legislate with respect to public order. The State can, no
   doubt, request the Central Government to send its armed forces for maintaining
   public order but it cannot itself direct such deployment.
