## Dr. Narco and Other Stories from Kafkaland

### Action/Reaction

We are sipping our black coffees in silence. Me, just exhausted, and he killing time, before he is summoned into another TV studio. It's a busy day for 'security experts', the day after twin blasts in Hyderabad.[^7] We have just finished a show where this gent has been on the whole sober, arguing that media and public pressure force agencies to commit errors. At this moment, the anchor strides in, and demands, "so, what is this Indian Mujahideen?"

"I was raring to answer this question --- I wish you had asked me this. I have a theory on this" he says softly. As retired head of R&AW, he is expected to have a theory on this.

"I think Indian Mujahideen is a rubric. There are many cells, not connected with another." He continues, but it is instantly obvious that his theory is not original but the latest to emanate from the intelligence community. The honeycomb model of loose, uncoordinated cells, unrelated to each other is the favoured IM theory these days.

"I don't agree with Uday Bhaskar that the roots of IM are to be found in Babri Masjid or Gujarat 2002", referring to the argument of our co-panelist on the show.

Ok, here may be something interesting. "It goes back much farther."

"How far back? Independence? Partition? Pre-Independence?" ventures the anchor gamely.

"Oh no. Much farther back. It will be the subject of a rather long monologue, I'm afraid." But then undeterred by his own threat of monologue, he lowers his voice to a whisper. "Abrahamic traditions," he reveals, as though this may be a State secret. The sound of his own words has a warming effect on him. "There is no meeting ground between Abrahamic traditions and traditions of the east. Abrahamic traditions are history-centred unlike Hinduism."

He launches into a fusillade against Islam, forgetting for the moment, his own theory of Abrahamic traditions. "You see, jihad is a religious obligation in Islam."

"Hindus can _never_ be violent," the Chief is in full flow now.

"What of the Mecca Masjid, Ajmer Sharif, Aseemanand, sadhvi Pragya?" asks the anchor. My head is oscillating between the two, almost as though this were a tennis match.

Chief smiles beatifically. "Hindus have been involved only in five incidents. These were _reactions_ to what they saw around them. Hindu terrorism is an oxymoron. It _cannot_ exist."

At this moment, I let out my breath, which I have been holding for the past five minutes, collect my bag and leave.

In January 2013, India's newsrooms suffered a collective implosion following the Home Minister's Jaipur blasphemy.[^8] The Congress was left collecting the detritus as senior ministers dismissed Shinde's Hindu terror remarks as personal opinion. "Terror has no colour" became the sudden righteous slogan of all news channels and all regulars thereof. Have we ever termed jihadi terror as "green", they asked, incensed at the coinage of "saffron terror". The innocence of our experts was charming, if nothing else. Many cussed characters took a more uncharitable view of this hullabaloo over Hindu terror, but we can ignore these conspiracy theorists, for now. Let us focus for the moment on one of the favourites on the endless discussion programmes on news channels: a retired cop. A former police commissioner of Mumbai, MN Singh, who had led the investigations into the 'Black Friday' blasts of 1993 condemned it as "politically coined terminology... very handy for some people to counter the charge of jihadi terrorism." "In my opinion", he concluded, "there is nothing like Saffron terrorism. _It just doesn't exist in the Hindu pantheon_." (sic)

Sanatan Sanstha and Abhinav Bharat were localized phenomena, which had "been nipped in the bud" by the NIA. Terrorists of the Hindu variety --- oxymoronic as they are, even if they exist --- lack the capacity, the capability, the resources, but above all "_even the motivations_". Of course Mr. Singh did not rule out the possibility of involvement of some Hindu groups, but their actions were to be classed as "_retaliatory attacks_" --- "retaliatory attacks as opposed to organized home-grown terror sponsored by Pakistan".[^9]

How could Hindus possibly bomb their own country --- except in retaliation? The idea of Hindus as the only true and natural citizens of India has long been elevated to the mythical. As is the binary between a violent Islam and a non-violent Hinduism. These prejudices are the operating codes for those at the apex of investigating agencies. Frightening, but no longer surprising.

### Mumbai

_Suryaprakash_. Sun light. Suggesting warmth, glow, life. But to those who have passed through the torture chambers of the Maharashtra ATS, it invokes horrific memories of burns, blisters and scorches --- suffering which continues hours after suryaprakash oil is applied to their nostrils, anal passage and penis. Among these singularly unlucky men were those thirteen charged with planning and executing the blasts in Mumbai trains in 2006.

On 11th July 2006, in just over ten minutes, seven bombs tore through the first class compartments of Mumbai's local trains, killing close to 200 people and injuring hundreds others. In an act of cheap mimesis, commentators swiftly labeled it India's 7/11. In two days flat, the Home Ministry discovered SIMI's stamp over the blasts.[^10]

A week after the blasts, the Mumbai Police released photos of two suspects, Sayyad Zabiuddin and Zulfeqar Fayyaz, and the following day, named a third one, Rahil.[^11] Then slyly, only a week later, the same police presented three catches to the media: Kamal Ansari and Khalid Aziz Ronak Sheikh arrested from Basupatti village in Madhubani district of Bihar; Ansari's brother-in-law Mumtaz Ahmed Maqbool Ahmed Choudhary from Navi Mumbai.[^12]

Neither the Mumbai police, nor the crime reporters remembered anything about the first list of suspects.

Between July and September, many more arrests were made, taking the total to 13, and the crime was triumphantly declared as solved. At a press conference, held on 30 September, the Commissioner of Police described the ATS's handiwork as a "beautiful piece of highly professional investigation"[^13] and outlined how ISI had trained, supported and directed Lashkar and SIMI operatives to carry out the blasts, working in pairs. He also described in precise detail how the bombs were rigged: From RDX sourced from Pakistan and locally available ammonium nitrate, one Mohammad Ali fashioned these bombs, packing the explosives into "eight five litre pressure cookers of the brand name Kanchan".[^14]

By way of proving the ISI-SIMI collaboration, a dead body lying unclaimed in the city morgue was identified as Salim from Lahore.[^15] This dead man was listed in the chargesheet as deceased accused 1, address and other details not known, nationality Pakistani. No one asked, and none answered as to how a burnt and mangled torso wrenched out from the blast site was identified as 'Salim of Lahore, other details not known'.

News reports from that period --- based largely on official press conferences, which are always aplenty in Mumbai, and unofficial sources, which never run dry anywhere --- describe how the case was cracked. Even then, it would have been obvious to any half caring observer, there wasn't much. The case hinged primarily on two things: telephone records; and secondly, in admitted absence of other evidences and leads, the 'scientific method' of narco-analysis.[^16]

Lets look at the telephone records first. The breakthrough in the case allegedly came from high traffic of phone calls between Mumtaz and his brother-in-law Kamal Ansari in the week preceding the blasts. The duo's guilt hinged on the reference to Nepal --- which is in touching distance of Ansari's Madhubani village, and which every Bihari in that belt will tell you is the favoured destination for weekly shopping.

Between 17 August and 25 September 2006, the ATS filed five remand applications seeking the custody of accused on grounds that their cell phones had been seized and their call records were being obtained, compared and analyzed.

A remand application, dated 22 August 2006, claimed that Abdul Wahid Din Shaikh (accused 8) used to give his mobile phone for "contacting members of _Lashkar-e-Toiba_ (LeT) outside India" on behalf of Mohammad Sajid Ansari (accused 7).

An extension of the remand of accused 1--9 was sought on the claim that Kamal Ansari had received arms training in Pakistan and "used the mobile phone and email addresses for communicating with those persons (in Pakistan) and passing on message. The call records of his mobile phone are being analyzed." This was on 25 September. On the same day, ATS filed another application listing recoveries of cell phones and sim cards from Dr. Tanveer (accused 2), Ehtesham Kutubuddin Siddiqui (accused 4), Shaikh Mohammad Ali Alam Shaikh (accused 6), which had been sent to the FSL Hyderabad "for examining and extracting information in it." It also stated "that on the instructions from the accused No. 5 Mohd. Faizal, the accused No. 6 was contacting other members of LeT on his mobile phone of a given number."[^17]

Each remand application created the impression of hectic investigations and forensics whose fruitful conclusion necessitated extended periods of remand. Not one of these applications was turned down. From the time of their detention to the press conference on 30 September, all 13 remained in the custody of the ATS. But apparently, this rich haul of evidence by way of CDRs were to be supplemented by the 'scientific' method of narco analysis, which would supposedly reveal the modus operandi of the operatives: how they went to Pakistan for training; how they helped the Pakistani operatives to cross over to India; how they prepared the bombs and planted them, down to the minutest detail.

On the second anniversary of the blasts in 2008, Shahid Azmi, lawyer for the train blasts accused, himself later felled by the bullets of hired assassins, circulated two letters on behalf of the accused.[^18] The first was a letter of condolence to the victims of the blasts. "We, thirteen --- innocent accused, are with you in this time of the grief and remembrance," it said.

>We request you not to consider us as murderers, but victims who are suffering for a deed with which they have no connection at all. We are not a part of any conspiracy, nor are we associated in any way with Lashkar-e Tayyaba. We have not even seen any al-Qaeda manual, we are not bomb makers nor are we the planters. To be true we have not committed any crime nor have we given any confession.
> 
>ATS has just played this game with the sole aim of silencing the public and the so called leaders and to diffuse the atmosphere of fear that had been created. Unfortunately, the perpetrators of the terror are still roaming free. The truth is that the ATS remained clueless (intentionally or unintentionally) and we were made the scapegoats so that they heave a sigh of relief. No doubt you are suffering for the loss of your near and dear ones, but we are suffering each moment for the last two years.

The second letter titled 'Arrest of the Accused --- the Real Facts' chronicled in chilling and bare prose the diverse practices of cruelty devised by the ATS. Tied to a plank with ropes, water is poured continually on the face till the chosen victim loses consciousness --- meanwhile a machine monitors blood pressure to ensure that it doesn't spike up too high, causing death. Trussed up in a chair, unable to move his head even an inch, the victim is subjected to a continuous falling of water droplets. Hours of this unceasing torture lead to severe pain in neck and head. Legs torn asunder at 180 degrees, gases which cause painful swelling of the body, high voltage shocks to private parts, beatings by flour mill belts, humiliation and stripping of family members --- it's a sickening catalogue guaranteed to make your bile rise, torture that broke them psychologically but also left its imprint on the bodies of these men. But not enough apparently for the magistrate --- to whom the accused even submitted a written complaint about the torture inflicted upon them --- to act to ensure their safety. Disregarding the written submission, the court extended their custody to the ATS who renewed their brutalization with greater vigour. No doubt, the bogey of CDR analysis was crucial to these extraordinarily long remands.

Two years after Shahid Azmi circulated the letter to civil rights activists, and just months after he was assassinated, the venerable editor of _Milli Gazette_ received a letter from the high security Anda Cell of Mumbai Central Jail. The writer of this letter was Ehtesham Qutub, accused number 4 in the Mumbai train blasts case. It described in detail not only the tools and devices of torture in the various offices of ATS and Mumbai police, but also the farce of narco analysis, conducted without consent of the accused, or permission from the court. Ehtesham was subjected to the first test in Chandan Chowki at Juhu on 5 August 2006 in the presence of officers from Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Mumbai.[^19]

The next day, Ehtesham writes, he was taken to Bangalore for brain mapping, polygraph and narco analysis test through a Jet Airways flight. He was subjected to these tests a third time on 12 September 2006, and yet again on 24 September. In Bangalore, these tests were conducted by Dr. Malini, the institute's Assistant Director, notorious as 'Dr. Narco'. Ehtesham wasn't the only one to be injected with sodium pentathol, a banned drug, used as anaesthesia in these tests, and which can cause heart attack --- all accused suffered these degrading tests multiple times. What information did the ATS extract from these tests? This was revealed when the ATS confronted the accused with a CD of these sessions. Whilst these dubious tests have no validity --- inadmissible in court as evidence --- the accused were stunned to discover that the tapes had been manipulated and questions inserted to produce a narrative of guilt. For example:

>Q: How many bombs were planted?
> 
>A: Seven
>
>The original question had been:
>
> 
>Q: What comes after six?
> 
>A: Seven
>
>Q: Who was involved in the conspiracy of the blasts?
> 
>A: Dr. Tanveer, Ehtesham, Faisal, Kamal Muzammil, Asif.
>
>The original question was:
>
>Q: Who are the people in the cells next to yours?
> 
>A: Dr. Tanveer, Ehtesham, Faisal, Kamal Muzammil, Asif.

Ehtesham, in his letter from prison, accused Dr. Malini of colluding with the ATS to produce these doctored CDs. In the second letter sent out by Azmi in 2008, Naveed, accused number 12, complained that Dr. Malini forced favourable answers out of him by pulling his ears with a plier as he lay drugged and vulnerable in her lab. These cannot be dismissed as empty allegations of men frustrated by long years of incarceration. In his prison diaries, published after he was acquitted of charges of being a treasonous Naxalite, Arun Ferreira recounted his tryst with Dr. Malini: "During narco-analysis, she slapped and abused me, pinched my ears with pliers, and even administered electric shocks to me and my co-accused to keep us from turning unconscious."[^20] When she was ignominiously ousted in 2009, there were 400 cases in queue waiting for her expert attention, a reflection of her reputation for 'results' amongst investigating agencies.[^21]

What is clear now, but should have been obvious at that time too, was that the charade of CDRs was being played out to buy time. Time needed to torture and extract confessions. The narco tests provided a template for the confessions --- for this is all that the prosecution's shaky scaffolding stood on. These torture confessions were all that held up the weight of the 11,000-page chargesheet. So when the accused retracted their confessions, alleging that they had been extracted through torture, they were brutally attacked inside the Mumbai Central Prison. A judicial inquiry submitted to the High Court, indicted not only the jail officials but also the doctors of the government hospital for participating in falsifying evidence of attack on the inmates by deliberately failing to maintain records of injuries and refusing to treat the injured and bleeding prisoners.[^22]

The voluminous chargesheet itself is an interesting document: the pressure cookers --- down to the brand --- announced with such fanfare as the containers of the bombs disappeared mysteriously from the chargesheet. "Evidence has come on record," it now reads, "that on 10.07.2006 after the explosive devices were assembled and kept in _black Rexene bags_; this very place was used by the conspirators to store the explosive devices before they were brought to Churchgate Railway Station on 11.07.2006."

The call details, once deemed so crucial necessitating endless extensions of custody of the accused, are not so much as mentioned in the chargesheet. In November 2009, when the prosecution evidence was being adduced, Ehtesham Qutub moved an application in the trial court seeking the CDRs of the telephones of the accused pleading that these would prove the innocence of the accused. The Special Public Prosecutor pleaded, "the prosecution was required to furnish the accused with the copies of only those documents that are relied upon by the prosecution, and that the application be dismissed." Dismissing the application, the court passed an order: "I do not consider that production of the documents asked for is necessary or desirable for the purpose of trial before this Court."

One year later, Kamal Ansari, accused number 1, appealed to the trial court to direct the ATS to submit the CDRs of his mobile phone collected by the agency during the investigation as he was certain that the records would support the "defence of alibi". Again, the SPP scoffed at this appeal urging the court to turn it down once again. The court agreed with the SPP that prosecution was duty bound to supply only those documents on which it has relied.

It was the High Court that finally said that whether those documents were relied upon by the prosecution or not "was an irrelevant consideration" if the accused felt that it could help "prove their innocence or facilitate their defence".

In fact it asked why the prosecution consistently stonewalled all appeals for the production of the records: "Was the prosecution conceding that these documents would establish what the appellants claimed they would? If not, what was the objection to produce the same and disprove the claim of appellants that the same would establish their innocence? Was the prosecution suggesting, by objecting to the production thereof, that if anything in favour of the accused had been found as a result of investigation, they were entitled to hide it and would not show it even to the Court?"[^23]

Faced with a court that refused to buy the shallowness of the plea that the prosecution will not produce what wasn't relied upon, the ATS lobbed a new grenade: it simply did not have the records. The telecom companies also initially tried wriggling out by feigning lack of records; and then demanded Rs 34 lakh to ferret them out. Only in March 2013 did they begin to furnish the CDRs free of cost[^24] --- six years after the police claimed that these call records held the key to unraveling the conspiracy, and three years after the accused demanded these be placed on record.

Such is the machinery of our criminal justice system: investigators who torture; doctors who comply; pseudoscientists with dubious truth serums; judges who ignore signs of torture; and a media which carries the burden of national security on its frail shoulders.
