## The Security Metaphysic

### Section I

"If it's a good man, he will be stopped by the pneumatic tyre killers." The chief operating officer explains earnestly, pointing to the mean looking metallic teeth that threaten to slash to ribbons anything that rolls over it. "If it's a bad man however, he will continue on. Then these bollards will rise and stop him." As he says this, a metallic cylinder rises from the floor with great sound and fury. And just in case the 'bad man' escapes this too, there is the crash rated barrier. A large screen runs an animation video on spool, graphically demonstrating how the tyre killers, bollards and barriers can combat an onslaught of suicide bombers. Together, these three are the core of the "affordable and impregnable security from Israel" being showcased at the Homeland Security Fair in Greater Noida. A 100 per cent owned subsidiary of a Holon-based company that offers "perimeter protection solutions" --- a popular phrase in this market --- these makers of tyre killers and bollards set up shop in Ahmedabad in 2010.

>"Why Ahmedabad?"
>
>"Its closer to the port and there are no workers unions in Ahmedabad." He smiles, the wry smile of those who feel entitled to labour trouble-free factories. It is also a smile that expects empathy in return. He gets none.
>
>"So, is business good?"
>
>"Between 2010 and now \[2012\], we have already secured Grand Chola and Bombay Stock Exchange."

A more recent visit to their website informs that they have also bagged orders for bollards at Hyatt chain of hotels, for an equity fund office in Madhya Pradesh and Tata Motors in Jamshedpur. Business is good. No doubt on that count. The COO, himself a major in the Indian Army went to Israel to attend a course on suicide attacks and swiftly decided on an early retirement in favour of this lucrative security business. Indeed, this industry is swarming with ex-army men, short service commission officers having finished their terms, voluntary retirees and venerable generals and major generals. Some, senior managers and directors; some, spokespersons and consultants; some, editors of trade magazines; and others simply 'security experts' and regular fixtures on TV shows.

The cavernous interiors of the Noida Expo building are filled with companies --- British, Israeli, Korean, Taiwanese and Indian multinationals such as Godrej to down-right local, cottage types operating out of West Delhi --- peddling a plethora of wares. Bollards are a favourite of course, tyre killers and biometric technology are hot too --- but the winner hands down is the CCTV camera. There is a great array to choose from: intelligent video armonia (because a large number of cameras must be able to work together "like musicians in an orchestra"), "full High Definition network solution" and "State of the art surveillance". And oh, we have a heart: part of the proceeds from the sales of Ever Focus --- offering "total surveillance solutions"--- go to the NGO CRY (Child Rights and You).

The hard-sell can produce an unintended irony though. The Japanese Fujitsu advertises PalmSecure, allegedly the world's most advanced biometric authentication system", as "the fastest, simplest, most versatile and efficient system available to verify your identity: _to make sure that you are, in fact, who you say you are_." Who precisely is it targeting? Those very, whose identity is to be authenticated through its technology? Or perhaps, it imagines a world where we are all willing subjects and pliant bodies, participating in our own surveillance and monitoring.

The Homeland Security Fair is only one of the many exhibitions and expos that focus on the sale of surveillance devices, protective (as in "perimeter protection") equipment and associated ancillaries. It is, in fact, a rather latecomer in the field.

The first mover was the Ministry of Defence, which set up the Defence Exhibition Organisation as early as 1981 to showcase the indigenous defence industry, entirely public sector with DRDO and ordnance factories, by organizing exhibitions in India and abroad. Beginning with Aero India in 1996, and the Land and Naval Systems exhibition, Defexpo, in 1999,[^164] its biennale exhibitions rapidly established themselves as preeminent trade hubs, so much so that by 2010, the total area of exhibition had spread to 40,000 square metres --- from 17000 sq metres in the 2008 exhibition --- and the rental had skyrocketed. Israel led the foreign exhibitors in renting as much as 1200 square metres of display space by shelling out Rs 3.5 crores.[^165] By 2012, it had grown even bigger: 567 exhibitors from 32 countries: SAAB, ABG Shipyard, Boeing, Polaris, HAL, Mahindra and Mahindra, TATA, Sirkosky, shipbuilders Navantia, Israel Aerospace Industry, Vectra, BAE Systems.[^166]

What draws these builders of ships, makers of helicopters, manufacturers of airplanes and assorted military vehicles to the India expo in such large numbers? Inaugurating the Expo, the then-Minister of State for Defence, Pallam Raju, appreciated the "unprecedented growth" of the Defexpo, which he saw as a reflection of the "size of the defence market in India".[^167]

To be sure, these are not empty words of a minister seducing investors. Budgetary allocations for defence have been steadily soaring the past few years. In 2011--12, the Union Defence Budget comprised 1.8 per cent of the total GDP; in the following year, the budget shot up marginally to 1.9 per cent of the GDP.

The 15-year Long Term Integrated Perspective Plan (LTIPP) approved by the Defence Acquisition Council, which is the source of defence planning, envisages the allocation of defence to touch three per cent of the total GDP --- a feat yet not attained.[^168]

However, in absolute numbers, the outlays for defence far outstrip allocations for social welfare programmes. Its share in terms of expenditure was higher than the combined spending of health and family welfare, school education and literacy schemes, higher education and rural welfare. (See table)[^169]

These high figures for defence spending weren't high enough for some though. Defence budget watchers complained that the forces had underspent the outlays allocated to them in 2011--12, surrendering a portion at the time of revised estimates.[^170] A _Times of India_ report sensationalized and hyped the alleged cuts in capital outlays by as much as Rs. 100 crores, which, it predicted would stymie the acquisition process.[^171] This was despite the fact that 2013--14 budget had displayed an increase in both revenue and capital expenditure --- despite the Defence Minister's warning that a dip in budget was in the offing, the finance minister had refrained from slashing the defence funds. Indeed, the outlays had bloated, except that the percentage of GDP had dropped to 1.79 as opposed to previous year's healthy 1.93.[^172]

India has been for some years now in the throes of a procurement cycle. As its Soviet-era jets and submarines begin to age and rust, and as it is blinded by its own pretensions to regional hegemony, its multitudinous insurgencies calling to be quelled, and as the state-owned ordnance factories and PSUs fail to match up --- the wheels of the procurement cycle turn, slowly, laboriously, oiled along by DPP. Defence Procurement Procedure, formulated in 2001, has undergone several revisions, each amendment further aiding private participation, turning private players from mere suppliers of raw materials and parts to full-scale licensed producers.

In early 2014, SIPRI released 2009--2013 figures of international transfer of weapons, which confirmed India at top of the pile.[^173] India accounted for 14 per cent of global arms imports, and its imports were three times greater than either China or Pakistan.[^174] Its preeminence derived from its extensive shopping through the 2000s, reflected in the budgetary spends: over 100 Su-30MKI combat aircraft from Russia, three A-50Ehl airborne early warning aircrafts (with components sourced from Israel, Russia and Uzbekistan), an Akula nuclear-powered submarine from Russia;[^175] the first of eight P-81 anti-submarine warfare aircraft, ten C 17 Globemaster III Airlifters and six C 130 J Super Hercules Transport aircraft from the United States;[^176] six Scorpene submarines from France.[^177] The Defence Minister announced in the Lok Sabha in May 2013 that the procurement of 100 self-propelled artillery howitzers was on the anvil.[^178]

But the most massive deal ever in the military history of the country, and one of the biggest in the world too, produced by Indian Air Force's modernization drive is the purchase of 126 Medium multi role combat aircraft worth upwards of 15 billion USD.[^179] There is some dispute as to what the real costs of the purchase will ultimately be, with some arguing that it should have been estimated at USD 27 billion even in 2009.[^180]

Military expenditure in India is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8.3 per cent and is expected to exceed $ 75 billion per year by 2020.[^181] Different agencies estimated slightly different numbers for the future defence budgets but all converged on the prediction that it was only bound to grow. As the brochure from one of the many defence exhibitions cheerfully outlined: "The Indian government has indicated no slowdown in homeland security and defence spending despite the global meltdown."

A recession-struck Western arms industry looks at India's insatiable appetite for arms and defence equipment to stay afloat. All the big boys of international arms trade have come out to play in India.

### Section II

In 1961, when demitting office, the US President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned of the absolute influence --- "economic, political, even spiritual" --- which the conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry" wielded, and which could be "felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government." He urged his successor and the American citizens to "guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist."[^182]

But it is precisely this caution that our commentators, defence analysts and security experts are urging the government to cast away, and instead to embrace the 'military industrial complex'.

The ripples of the New Economic Policy reached the last bastion of the public sector --- defence --- only in 2001, when the newly minted DPP allowed 100 per cent participation by the private sector with foreign direct investment (FDI) permissible up to 26 per cent, subject to security clearances and licensing. The DPP of 2006 introduced the offset policy requiring all foreign vendors who were making sales upwards of Rs 300 crores to spend 30 per cent of their costs in India either through direct purchase of defence products and components manufactured by either the Defence PSUs or private defence industry; FDI in Indian defence industries for joint ventures, co-production agreements etc and finally FDI in defence R & D. Defence Offset Facilitation Agency (DOFA) was set up to "assist potential vendors in interfacing with the Indian defence industry for identifying potential offset products/projects as well as provide requisite data and information for this purpose."[^183] The list of products which could be used by foreign vendors to discharge their offsets obligations has since then been expanding: from 13 products identified in 2008, the DPP now includes 27 products with the express addition of "Products for Internal Security" and "Civil Aerospace Products".

Traditional players like Tatas and Mahindra were quick to adapt to this windfall. Anand Mahindra claimed in an interview at the Def Expo 2012 that Mahindra had smelt the opportunity a decade earlier --- just when the procurement wheel was about to turn --- and had presciently engineered a shift in their approach to the defence market in setting up Mahindra Defence Systems and Mahindra Aerospace. From its earlier approach of "here is a truck, lets paint it olive green and turn it into a military vehicle", it has moved to "strategically, what's the path forward? What are the defence requirements of this country? In which areas? Where can we build advantages?" But lest he overplay the defence opportunity and 'strategic importance' of his company's move, he adds quickly, "in fact it is a need more than an opportunity".[^184]

So even as one witnesses the surge in foreign arms companies fishing for contracts in India, Indian private sector --- even that traditionally not involved in defence sector --- realizing the spoils to be had from the offset policy is increasingly venturing into defence to cash in on the offsets policy.

Reliance India Limited (RIL), India's biggest private sector company, which built its riches on textiles and polyester, before expanding into fibre intermediates, plastics, petrochemicals, and then oil and gas explorations, announced its entry into the defence market by hiring Boeing's head in India, and then signing a deal with his former employers to partner in its offsets requirements in its project to supply P8I naval reconnaissance aircraft to the Indian Navy. A "more definitive agreement" is also in the offing. Its application with Department of Industrial Planning and Policy (DIPP) sought an industrial license to "design, develop, manufacture, equipment and components, including airframe, engines, radars, avionics and accessories for military and civilian aircraft, helicopters, unmanned airborne vehicles and aerostats". RIL has indicated to the press its intention of pumping in $1 billion and hiring between 1500--2000 engineers in the near future in its aerospace division. This only demonstrates the expectations of high growth the market leaders have from this sector.[^185]

From purveyors of tea to makers of medicines, the defence sector allures and beckons all. In 2011, Rossell Tea Ltd metamorphosed into Rossell India Limited to more accurately reflect its new interests in the aerospace and defence segments, soon tying up with the Canadian firm CAE Canada "to provide simulation training solutions to the Indian defence market".[^186]

When the pharma giant Piramal was looking to foray into new sectors, defence and security solutions was one of its chosen fields, hiring retired Deputy Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Nirdosh Tyagi, whose experience in procurement and production would "come in handy".[^187] The same year, Piramal Enterprises acquired a 27.83 stake in Israeli Bluebird Aero Systems, manufacturer of Unmanned Aerial Systems, for Rs 40 crore. Reports circulating in the media suggested that Piramal group was wooing the US-based Global Technical Systems, which has produced AN/APS-151 Radar, an airborne surveillance tool that can be installed on unmanned aerial vehicles.[^188] In less than a year from its launch, Piramal systems had signed a MOU with the Swedish group Saab to produce land electronic defence systems (LEDS).[^189]

The country currently imports about 70 per cent of its defence equipment. Much handwringing has been done in security circles on this dependence on fickle international traders. The need for indigenization has been underscored often enough. While announcing finalization of the new DPrP in end-2010, Defence Minister A K Antony declared that the DPrP had become necessary because "a nation aspiring for membership of the Security Council, a place on the high table of the nations, still depending heavily on foreign countries for supply of defence equipments is not good for us."

A trawl through the growing literature on defence will yield this: first, the public sector has failed miserably to deliver, which justifies abandoning the ordnance factories and PSUs and DRDO; second, the private defence industry ought to be given tax benefits and other concessions, preferably a SEZ or two to encourage them to enter this field; only the private sector can attract the talent required for defence innovation and R & D goes the argument, thus naturally requiring a greater cushioning by the government. But since the local industry is not yet ready for taking on these onerous tasks laid out by these well meaning defence analysts, foreign intervention is essential. But since foreign companies will likely not be interested in joint ventures where they have little control owing to the 26 per cent cap on FDI, this 'bottleneck' must be removed.

How ingeniously a case for indigenization is turned into a clarion call for wholesale privatization of the defence sector. Experience and evidence suggest that far from investing in R&D, private sector has been rather shy on this front, with almost the entire R&D in this country being sponsored by the State sector and public institutions. If the influence of the big corporates on India's economic policies, indeed their ability to even install pliant ministers, is any marker, imagine their power to direct the foreign policy, once they become in charge of research, design and manufacturing of weapons and arms. One commentator even argued for greater private role by bringing forth evidence that defence PSU managers "have actually been going out of their way to serve the interests of the foreign 'partner', rather than the PSU they head".[^190]

### Section III

The defence and security industry has been mainstreamed and domesticated by the TV channels by incorporating them under their car and bike shows, where gushing auto reporters, drooling at the size of tyres of Polaris off roaders, speak dreamily about TATA's mine protected vehicles (MPV) advertised to withstand powerful landmines and heavy gun fire in Maoist areas. At least a part of the bloated defence budget would be spent within the country against movements and 'insurgencies'. Tata had already delivered 32 MPVs to Maharashtra State Police and five to Jharkhand Police by 2012.[^191]

But the big toys are only part of the story. 'Homeland' security is no small business. If the aforementioned Homeland Security Fair is a purely private affair, INDESEC, one of the earliest in the field, boasts of its association with Ministry of Home Affairs, the principal shopper for these trinkets and tools. The wily pundits at ASSOCHAM smelling an opportunity set up "India's only integrated homeland security and defence systems event" in 2008. This was watershed year for the nascent homeland security market, punctuated as it was by serial blasts across many cities, including Delhi, but the year-end tragedy and madness --- memorialized as "26/11"--- proved to be truly epoch changing for the industry. The image of flames bellowing out of the Taj Mahal hotel quickly seared itself into what is called the 'national conscience' --- a polite euphemism for big media, corporate houses and the right wing inclined political section. It rivaled and replaced the Parliament attack of some years ago as the definitive 9/11 moment of the country.

From the debris of the Taj emerged several interlocked narratives. The principal of these was outrage. Outrage at violence reaching the Taj Mahal hotel --- resurrected as the undisputable icon of India, and even more exaggeratedly as the central civic institution.[^192]

>Let's start something guys. A non-cooperation movement to show that we are not taking this lying down. Let it be started by corporates, a nameless, leaderless movement. Lets show the leaders and politicians that we want our safety...

This text message drew hundreds of middle class and well-heeled Mumbaikars to the Gateway of India, leading advertising guru Prahlad Kakkar to gush, "we have never seen such a show of solidarity for a single cause at the gateway of India."[^193]

City as the site of violence was hardly new. But with posh seven star hotels turning into battlefields, its heat seemed to have singed those who had remained inured and protected from violence hitherto. India Inc. reacted by quickly and unselfconsciously demanding protection for itself --- as tax payers, creators of wealth and as citizens. Indeed, there was hardly a distinction between these categories. There was simultaneously a denunciation of the political class, always an inexact category, and the processes of democracy. Industrialists and captains seethed against the politicians first for enjoying "z plus security", and second, for allowing "vote bank politics" to compromise security concerns.

The vantage point from which Simi Garewal, actor and celebrity chat show host, spoke on a TV show was both metaphorical and literal:

>Go to the Four Seasons and look down from the top floor at the slums around you. Do you know what flags you will see? Not the Congress's, not the BJP's, not the Shiv Sena's. Pakistan! Pakistani flags fly high! ... You know what I think? We should carpet-bomb Pakistan. That's the only way we can give a clear message.

Garewal may have apologized later for mistaking Islamic flags for Pakistani, but her belligerent outburst on television encapsulated many of the concerns of "corporate survivors" --- a label devised by the business news channel NDTV Profit, not for those who had _survived_ the horrible gun fire inside the hotels --- the loss of lives at VT station was hardly even discussed --- but those who were now left dealing with a battered image of India, especially Mumbai, as a financial and investment destination. It was time, decided NDTV Profit, for these corporate survivors to turn into "corporate activists". Launching a series called Ideas for Change, its Managing Editor espoused:

>Through this campaign we wanted CEOs to use their experience in drafting a blueprint which will help us all to contain this terror. We required ideas from the corporates who till this time have helped in building the shares of their stakeholders and expanding the Indian industry; to provide solutions to issues that would help in safeguarding our country from terrorism.[^194]

Egged on by an anchor reminding them of the monies they created for the government, one after another, these corporate survivors/activists vented their indignation against the political establishment, demanded greater public-private partnership in governance (because governments and bureaucracies are corrupt whereas corporates perform better at delivering); called for internal security to be divorced from Home Ministry, which in thrall to vote bank politics (an established code language for imagined pandering to Muslims) was refusing to take action against terrorists; and finally, a greater investment in security.

Arun Nanda, then executive director of Mahindra and Mahindra, commended more recently for his "grace" and "classic elegance",[^195] demanded on the business channel, "accountability not only from people we elect but from people whose salary we pay from our hard-earned money". His big 'idea for change' to achieve this accountability was to break from "Friedman's philosophy of business only as business" and "to start up a body or a union of employees or business people together" and "demand what US did after 9/11, like Homeland Security --- an independent body who is not politicized, who is responsible for our children's lives" [sic]. Ajay Piramal --- whose Piramal Group was to move into defence and security business a few years later, but then his website describes him as someone "known for identifying opportunities ahead of the curve" --- echoed the imperative to follow the example of US which had not experienced any terror attack since 9/11. Vikram Singh Mehta, Chairman of Shell India, and who lived next door to the exclusive Oberoi hotel, could do no better than lift from George Bush: "we should not allow people who are opposed to our way of life."

The litanies of political incompetence and corruption were matched by panicked cries of insecurity. Mohandas Pai of Infosys declared loss of faith in the political leadership which had ensured "z plus security" for itself while leaving the industry to the perils of terror attacks. "What about us? [If] the government is unable to protect us, then amend the law. Let us bear arms, we will protect ourselves to whatever extent we can." Anxious that metal detectors, frisking and CCTV security were too flimsy a foil against automatic weapons and grenades, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw demanded "much stronger help from the government... We'll need military intervention. Maybe we could start some military patrolling at least." Both Pai and Shaw were speaking at a meeting convened by the Karnataka government to reassure an alarmed Industry following the Mumbai attack.[^196] And certainly many of these top business houses chose Central Industrial Security Force to guard their premises. Others like DLF in Gurgaon set up their own security company to guard its malls and office complexes --- not very different from feudal private armies meant to guard their fiefdom.

But these were not merely the hysterical eruptions of an industry feeling besieged by the possibilities of terror attacks. The public-private partnership in internal security was already well underway by this time. The private security business was proliferating: guarding universities, schools, gated communities, housing societies, malls and business centres. By this time, the Delhi-based Security and Intelligence Services (SIS) had acquired Australia's largest security firm, Chubb Security, which was up for sale, sealing the deal at around $300 million thus becoming the first Indian multinational in the security services industry.[^197] The global giant Securitas AB had entered the Indian market in 2007 by acquiring a 49 per cent stake in India's Walsons;[^198] companies like Globe, Tops and G4S were huge. However, the bulk of the private security market remained dominated by local and smaller companies. The Private Security Agencies (Regulation) Act (PSARA) was promulgated in 2005 in order to impose some order on this unregulated and fragmented market. In 2006, the Private Security Agencies Central Model Rules were framed for state governments to implement. These rules emphasized training for guards, supervisors and licensees.

The syllabus prescribed by the governments was meant to be wide, straddling physical fitness training, the correct wearing of uniform, fire fighting, crowd control, first aid, identification of improvised explosive devices, firearms, as well as rudimentary knowledge of law (including IPC and how to file an FIR).[^199] But all this would require training facilities, equipment, professional trainers --- meaning, training would cost money.

_Security Post_, the newsletter of Central Association of Private Security Industry (CAPSI), carried an editorial on the 'collective action' that was transforming the face of private security industry.

>Nobody among us ever thought that one day many State Governments will join hand with CAPSI to recruit and train security guards for their placement with guarding companies, those were always felt starved of educated and trained manpower. The Government of Punjab has started a new academy to train security guards and two batches have already passed out. The DGP of the State Police took the salute of the passing out parade. The State has already agreed to commence diploma and certificate courses for supervisory cadres and for the Security Management. The Government of Rajasthan has signed a MOU with CAPSI to establish Rural Institute of Security Education (RISE) in each district of the State. _Imagine getting well trained manpower from such institutes without spending money_.[^200]

The editorial prophesied that this "will provide stabiland growth to your business." More state governments were being approached so that members of CAPSI across the country could reap these benefits. But even more happily, skill development and training programmes were being supported by the central government schemes of national rural employment.[^201] Elsewhere, the chairman of CAPSI informed that it was "setting up 2,000 security training centres to be funded by state governments."[^202]

Very often, the private security industry would market itself as one of the largest employers of rural poor, thus portraying itself as worthy of government benefits and subsidies. At the CAPSI conference, held some months after the above-cited newsletter was published and a mere month and a half before Mumbai happened --- the private security industry plugged its preeminence as a job generator. Speaking at the same conference, the then Home Minister Shivraj Patil, admitted that he was "flabbergasted" to learn that "55 lakh men are working as guards and officers in private agency". \[sic\][^203] In absence of a high police to people ratio, the ubiquitous private guard began to be touted as an alternative to the police. It was another matter that this workforce was blighted by low wages, long and strenuous working hours, little social or job security.[^204] One security company advertised its services thus: "We Proudly declare that we have never faced any labour unrest within our force. Our employees are strictly prohibited to join any union. They are also not allowed to mix with other undesirable elements."[^205]

With 26/11, these comparatively sober arguments of the private security industry gave way to a more frenzied rhetoric. The chorus for private security to augment counterterrorism operations grew louder. Unsurprisingly, the attacks accelerated the already fast growing industry. From 22---25 percent growth rate, it was expected to jump to now 30--35, or even 40 per cent.[^206]

Barely a fortnight after the attacks, Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) organized a national conference on national security and terrorism in Delhi, attended by the who's who of the security establishment: B. Raman, Ajit Doval, Brijesh Mishra among others. From the conference emerged "a series of action points" which then were elaborated in a Task Force Report.[^207] Quoting the 9/11 Commission, which had outlined the "cost of doing business in a post 9/11 world", the report exhorted the Indian business community to prepare for the threat to "the luxury hotels that house foreign investors, the cafes that play host to all nationalities and the markets that sell the new India's success story". To the government it warned that national counterterrorism mechanism were essential to retain "foreign investment".[^208]

It echoed the views of the industry heads --- but naturally --- that private establishments urgently required armed protection. However, the laws governing private security establishments stood in the way of managements to equip their "private security with modern weapons freely accessible to terrorist". Private security firms wanted the removal of this legal hurdle to raise private militias --- of course only for those companies whose turnover crossed 100 crores --- but also wanted tax relief for "enhancing security".

It was also coincidental that from mid 2000s, the industrial belts, especially in Haryana and Rajasthan had been witnessing a restive labour force, increasingly demanding its right to unionize. This workforce had to be disciplined too.

### Section IV

India Inc. had pronounced the onset of the "era of Mumbai terror".[^209] New waves of "Jihadi fighters" were expected to spring from every turn and corner.

But every tragedy has the potential for profiteering. The Mumbai carnage triggered an unprecedented demand for security solutions. The coastlines had to be secured; the army and police modernized, cities monitored and populations mapped and accounted for. Airports, shopping malls, schools, streets --- the swathes which had to be secured were limitless.

The FICCI conference was only the first. Consultancy firms and business and trade bodies held conferences and symposia, conducted surveys and assessments, produced voluminous reports, petitioned, advised, cajoled and prescribed policy to the government. Internal security, long the preserve of the Ministry of Home Affairs, mutated into Homeland Security. It wasn't simply the arrival of a new terminology and lexicon; it also marked the unveiling of a new techno-security state, advocated feverishly by an elastic group of corporates, ex-army generals, technocrats, arms traders, think tanks, security experts, commentators --- and it was difficult mostly to tell one from another.

First, there was an assessment to make. Of the spoils that were to be had from this unprecedented expansion of market that 26/11 had spurred. There was suddenly a glut of reports and papers accounting the monies to be made from this unexpected opportunity.

You can almost sense them licking their lips and rubbing their hands as they tally up the "scope" of coverage in critical infrastructure protection ("very large and diversified" ... to the tune of USD 10 bn over the next 4--5 years"), fencing along Indo-Bangladesh border ("Rs 800 crores opportunity"); salivated at the outlays for border security initiatives (Rs 969.69 crores) for improving coastal security, for counterinsurgency and anti-terrorists schools, as well as for development of "infrastructure to address left wing extremism". And then there were projections about the emergent "Intelligence Cyber technology, security networks and identification" market arising from Natgrid, National Population Register, Unique Identification Card, centralised monitoring systems, lawful interception, biometric use in census --- all new initiatives undertaken post 2008 --- to keep the HS crowd excited.[^210]

And if this burgeoning market wasn't large enough, it had to be forged through the rhetoric of war and security. Introducing the _FICCI Task Force Report_, MP and chairman of the Task Force, Rajeev Chandrashekhar wrote:

>26/11 was an unprecedented attack on our nation. It reinforced the often forgotten fact, that we have a war being waged against us. The difference was 26/11 was an attack on the economic centers and establishment of our country. We have all come to realize that if left unchecked, this growing threat has the potential to derail our economic and social progress. On the one hand, some of our neighbours have combined conventional military wisdom and statecraft to support terrorist organisations that are determined to bleed India. On the other, naxalism and Maoist violence is spreading. It is a crisis unparalleled in the history of young India.[^211]

An unparalleled crisis, naturally, demands unparalleled measures. In calling for a "national counterterrorism architecture" which would include a new legislative framework, creation of new agencies and mechanisms, the deployment of emergent technologies, and a hawkish foreign policy, this report comprehensively lays down the ideological bedrock of HS in India. The blueprint for this architectural design is borrowed wholesale from the US. Therefore, setting up of National Intelligence Agency through an act of Parliament and amendments in the Unlawful Activity Prevention Act, "which would, inter alia, allow for the detention of terror suspects up to 180 days" in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, are lauded as important steps, but viewed as ultimately inadequate to "substantially enhance our capability to counter terror". Lamenting the fissiparous tendencies of the country's multiple intelligence and law enforcement agencies, it conceives of --- drawing from US experience of course --- the National Counter Terror Agency (NCTA), only replacing 'centre' with 'agency' here, as a mark of tropicalization, perhaps. The demand for an overarching institution to address internal security" has been raised repeatedly by reports of think tanks, even as recently as the summer of 2013, much after the idea of NCTC had been mauled as infringing upon the federal rights of the states.[^212]

The NCTC's function is conceived much like that of a cosmic blender, which combines, collates, refines and spews out information and intelligence on the one hand, and on the other the only agency empowered to act and coordinate all terror investigations. Not only would its Director General coordinate with National Intelligence Agency and head the National Intelligence Grid, but would also "be empowered to maintain liaisons with friendly security and counter terrorist agencies". The Report asks for this all-powerful NCTA's imbrication with the Intelligence Bureau, a body itself on very shaky legal ground.

Above all, FICCI Task Force's principle recipe for counterterrorism is invasive technology. Mesmerized again by the US' leveraging of IT as a "key weapon in the war against terror", the Report laments the wasting of vast amounts of personal information which lies unutilized in the isolated silos of banks, credit card companies, telephone companies, and in the trail of transactions made by every individual, which could have been harnessed by a "more integrated public surveillance system" to allow for the "seamless flow of information from one silo to another".[^213] That the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spent 3.75 Bn USD in 2004 and more than 11 Bn USD in 2005 in creating these common information and attendant data mining systems could be seen as an added incentive for the corporate sector to push for these excessive technological solutions. While these agencies may still have been in the realm of proposals and wishful thinking, the Report made a case for something that was more immediate: absorbing the data being produced by Nandan Nilekeni's UIDAI "as part of National grid to assist in counterterrorism".[^214] The ASSOCHAM-Aviotech report of 2011 gleefully noted that the UID project would create "business opportunities worth INR 6,500 (USD 1.44) in the first phase of implementation. A budget of INR 1470 Cr has been allocated during annual plan 2011--12."[^215] The Government may have been advertising UID as part of its weifarist package --- as the ultimate corruption-free passport to services and schemes[^216] --- it's uses as a money-spinner for the industry and surveillance tool for the security agencies were always on the surface.

If the folks at FICCI were at all anxious that agencies modeled after the US National Information Exchange Model (NIEM), which facilitates data sharing beyond law enforcement, and Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN), which makes data available from any computer terminal, would infringe upon the privacy and rights of citizens, the Chairman of the Task Force had already elaborated in his Notes from the Conference held in 2008 that the war on terror could not be won "without sacrifices". "National interest" is paramount and should prevail over any "other interests" _even if they are constitutionally and democratically valid_."[^217] Indeed, the Report emphasizes that the private sector "must support laws which may well entail invasion of privacy in order to make surveillance and monitoring effective".[^218]

It's a frightening coalescing of corporate greed and an authoritarian vision of the state.

(We may add here that Chandrashekhar, chairman of the FICCI Task Force --- and also a member of the Standing Committee on Finance headed by Yashwant Sinha which opposed the UID tooth and nail on grounds of national security --- began in 2014 to debunk the UID scheme as unnecessary and costly hype besides being a threat to individual privacy and national security, as the UID did not differentiate between citizens and illegal immigrants.[^219] His views came to be favoured by the policy makers at the right wing _Niti Central_,[^220] which advocated the replacement of the UID with the National Identity Number linked to the National Population Register. The UID in this view is a weak security tool which needs to be replaced with a more efficient one. In its maiden budget the Modi government allocated Rs 2039 crores in the first fiscal, despite BJP's blusterous opposition to UID during the UPA years.)[^221]

Though FICCI calls upon the civil society to intervene in this process, even asking them to engage in a dialogue with armed groups, and argues for the indispensability of human rights framework --- it becomes increasingly clear that FICCI imagines the civil society as a handmaiden in its Project Counterterrorism: its principal role being to conduct statistical and empirical research into the causes of terrorism (without of course "according any legitimacy to the perpetrators of violence"); to humanize the war against terror by "maintaining a principled approach to the applicability of human rights standards, i.e., these standards apply to both perpetrators and victims of violence", to liaise with media to "shape the public discourse around terrorism".[^222]

But FICCI gets burdened by its own rhetoric of human rights and swiftly condemns the same civil society, which "in reality [seems] to function more as a body to criticize every governmental move, and give greater importance to forces threatening the secular fabric of the country, or other negative forces. ... A code of ethics for their functioning needs to be evolved ... and any of these organisations breaching this code should be brought to book mercilessly..."[^223]

Criticism of the government is thus anathema, and wasting time on battling communalism is to be avoided. To the civil society, the Report recommends that it promote "positive vibes between the police and the people instead of making mockery of the police"; and following the Israeli model, engage itself in motivating the public to cooperate with the inconveniences of security procedures (because "people need to be disciplined in order to avoid bloodshed"); and support moves for provision for every visitor's details by hotels, guest houses, and even "_personal guests to local police_". Of course it would help if the government were to include security in the academic curriculum, schooling young minds in the need for such a regime; and further, if employment in government sector be made contingent on some years of compulsory service in the armed forces.[^224] (Though the private sector will do fine without this compulsory service.)

In its vision then, the role for each agency and institution is clearly defined: the private sector to develop the technologies of discipline and surveillance; the government to create the pseudo-legal apparatus of this technosecurity state; and the civil society to create a pliant and disciplined citizenry.

The sense of grandeur and delusion is not missing altogether. Advocacy of closer ties with US, both strategic and economic, is accompanied by cries for a foreign policy that mimics the US': covert operations, surgical strikes and all-out assault against Pakistan are highly recommended.[^225] Ignore the lack of irony in suffixing India's "commitment to global peace and prosperity" with it's "expeditionary military capabilities," the FICCI Report makes it clear that it desires for India's absorption into 'International community' (one of the names by which NATO goes) to fight terrorism "outside its geographical boundaries".[^226] This must be read in the light of so-called International community's attempts to draw India into its increasingly loss-making Afghanistan war.

The Task Force Report serves as the ideological template of the numerous Industry reports and surveys that followed. An offering by FICCI and Ernst & Young on "Building Safe and Secure Indian Cities", made this stunning observation: "In India, violence stems from incidents of terrorism in cities." But then its definition of a safe city is also rather original: "In essence", it says, "in a safe and liveable city, the market forces of demand and supply are able to operate efficiently to generate an efficient economy model."[^227]

In addition to terrorism, which drives away investors, the market forces are also obstructed by crime. Outlining the key risk factors --- inadequate living conditions, poverty, poor parenting and alcohol abuse, poor school performance, optimal functioning of schools, lack of employment opportunities --- _Building Safe and Secure Cities_ envisages a city at threat from the underclass --- indeed it criminalizes poverty itself. The solutions it offers are consistent with such a view of urban violence. It argues, ingeniously it thinks, for CPTED (Crime Prevention through Environmental Design). This is basically a fancy term for creating exclusive enclaves to keep out populations marked as potentially offensive and suspect through denial of access, manned security and such like. The second solution is totalizing surveillance technology including centralized data system, GIS-based analysis and reporting, and the ubiquitous CCTV camera.

ASSOCHAM-Aviotech's _Homeland Security Assessment_ reported how city surveillance projects in Delhi and Mumbai would present a business opportunity outstripping USD 100 mn.

There was an enthusiastic embracing of surveillance cameras across the country with government directing private institutions to deploy CCTVs. Malls, banks, cyber cafes, hotels and guest-houses, colleges and universities installed these cameras with or without these directives.[^228]

_Building Safe and Secure Cities_,[^229] Wipro's whitepaper underlines the need for "integrated solutions for a safe city" and lauds the London model (which incidentally has more CCTV cameras per person than anywhere else, and according to a study, a busy Londoner was likely to be captured on a CCTV almost 300 times a day,[^230] so pervasive was the network) and welcomes the Safe Surat project. But to call it a whitepaper is a misnomer for it is little more than a brochure advertising Wipro's goods and services including video surveillance, facial recognition systems, and applications to analyze, sort and store this data. China's multi-billion 500,000 cameras security system in the megacity of Chongquing is also hailed as a great stride forward in securing cities through technology.[^231]

In India, the closest one comes to the London model, yet, is the Safe City Surat project.[^232] In its first phase, inaugurated by "the great leader" Narendra Modi in January 2013, 104 CCTVs have been installed at 23 points across the city. A dedicated optical fibre channel connects the cameras to each, feeding a massive 280 square foot "video wall" at the Command, Control and Communications center (C3). The data is stored in IBM computers (data storage, management and disposal is by itself another lucrative and emerging market) while the video cameras come from Verint Systems, an Israeli company known to be close to its intelligence agency. As an aside, one may note that Verint has also been accused of illegally wiretrapping Verizon phones in the US for NSA.[^233]

Safe City Surat imitates the British surveillance system in more ways than one. It is born out of a partnership between local business elites, police and authorities, just as in 1993, following the famous Bulger case, the British Home Secretary announced the allocation of £2 million of central government money for open street CCTV, to be won by bidding if cities could demonstrate matched funding from alternative sources.[^234] R.K. Asthana, the Police Commissioner in the aftermath of the blasts in Zaveri Bazar, the diamond market of Mumbai, in 2011, authored the scheme; diamond merchants of Surat raised the money; Surat Traffic Education managed funds. And thus was scripted another giddy story celebrating the 'Gujarat model of doing things'. By the conclusion of this "fine example of police-public-private partnership", 5000 surveillance cameras at over 500 locations in the city would be installed.[^235]

Described by Modi as Surat's 'third eye', the system would be used to combat Mumbai-type terror attack, as much as traffic offenders and criminals. Asthana paints a picture of the city overtaken by migrants and crime, the laidback Surati lala edged out by cutthroat migrants, creating the "unavoidable necessity of having better surveillance and security".

This agitation about migrants, traffic offenders and terrorists is part of a new managerial penology, in which risks are to be identified (created and hyped in many cases) and eliminated _before_ a crime. Numerous risk surveys conducted by consultancy firms attest to the rise of this actuarialism. The FICCI-Pinkerton India Risk Survey 2012 sets out to quantify "potentially destructive risks to the business enterprises of the country" in the backdrop of the "global economic meltdown".[^236] The risks enumerated in the Survey range from terrorism, cyber insecurity, fire, political instability, to strikes and workers' violence. Now part of AB Securitas, the world's largest security company, Pinkerton's illustrious history of 'risk management' includes breaking strikes on behalf of the US government in the 19th century that continued till the passage of Anti Pinkerton Act by the US Congress in 1893 to curtail the government's powers of breaking strikes.[^237] The Act prohibits the government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia from employing an individual hired by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, or similar organization.

Terrorism has emerged as a kind of hold-all in which specific threats can be accommodated. A report by Reliance-owned Observer Research Foundation (in partnership with the UK thinktank RUSI) focused on security risks associated with chemical, biological and radiological materials (CBR).[^238] The report tries desperately to link CBR with terrorism, simultaneously participating in the terror paranoia and feeding it. It harps on an incident of cyanide poisoning of a woman by suspected Laskar-e Tayyaba militants in Kashmir to hardsell a policy shift from safety to security. The path to this transition is to create an overarching legislative framework on the pattern of --- no prizes for guessing --- the US. Nuclear Disaster Preparedness Act 2011, Chemical Facility Anti Terrorism Security Authorization Act 2011 etc.[^239]

ORF's website no longer lists Lockheed Martin or Raytheon as its partners[^240] though a little more search will yield that the relationship has continued. ORF's joint workshop with National Bureau of Asian Research on India's Strategic Environment and Defence Policies was supported by US defence companies Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumann.[^241] Among the workshop's other sponsors was the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, an arch right wing foundation that aggressively pushes racist and Islamophobic writers and publications, funds commentators and think tanks who advocate a belligerent US foreign policy, and organizations that attack public funding of education and renewable sources of energy.[^242]

More recently, the Cyber Security and Cyber Governance Conference organised by ORF and FICCI received the support of Raytheon.[^243] In case one is wondering why a big weapons company would be interested in cyber governance in India, it might be worth knowing that Raytheon is said to have developed a new 'RIOT' software (Rapid Information Overlay Technology in plain language) which has the ability to mine data from social networking sites to track individuals, and also to predict their daily routines and practices in the near future. "We know where Nick's been, what he looks like and where he might be headed", cooed a pleased Raytheon employee in a demo CD. The technology has been shown to the US government and industry but not yet sold.[^244]

A report on transportation security published by Centre for the Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) mentions Godhra train burning (strictly as the trigger for largescale violence) but is amnesiac about the Samjhauta Express bombings.[^245] It predictably concludes with an appeal and a fervent wish for greater cooperation not only between government agencies, but also among the private sectors of US and India.

But as usual, the back-story can be more fascinating. A child of the Cold war era, CSIS, the report's publisher, is ranked fifth in the global hierarchy of think tanks[^246] and assigned the top spot among think tanks that work on security and international affairs.[^247] Its self-proclaimed mandate is to find "ways to sustain American prominence and prosperity as a force for good in the world".

The Transport Security Report's brief acknowledgements thank Security Watch India for research assistance and General Dynamics Corporation for the generous financial support. SWI is a consultancy firm cum wannabe think tank, which regularly organizes conferences on themes of homeland security. It is 'mentored' by Maroof Raza, made famous by his ability to outshout the Pakistani generals night after night on the truculent Times Now shows hosted by the ever bellicose and hyper nationalist Arnab Goswami. In 2012, a complaint was filed with the National Broadcasters Association that Maroof Raza's appearance as a defence and security analyst commenting on the Indian Army's Tatra trucks deal was a conflict of interest since his firm M/s Maroof Raza & Associates was an agent for several foreign arms manufacturers and dealers. The NBA finding credence in the complaint, adjudicated that his comments could have been coloured by the interests of his clients and directed that Times Now disclose the business interests of this expert panelist.[^248] Last heard, Mr. Raza of M/s Maroof Raza & Associates had begun anchoring a special show on strategic affairs called Latitude. As for the financers of this 'study', General Dynamics, described on its website as the market leader in business aviation, land combat and marine systems, has pretty much all elements covered.

These capillaries of think-tanks --- India is now home to the fourth largest number of think tanks, trailing behind only USA, China and UK --- defence companies, and industry with cross cutting interests have spun so fine a web that it is sometimes difficult to decipher who is who.

Are fears of a totalitarian society and _Nineteen Eighty Four_-esque State unfounded? Remember that these surveillance practices would be conjoined with ideological assumptions about 'dangerous classes potential offenders', as well as elitist exclusionary spatial strategies. Remember also that it is not simply a big brother panoptic camera eye that watches over us (the data offered up by CCTVs has been often found to be grainy and unreliable); it is enmeshed with many other newly emerging techniques such as the centralized monitoring system which will enable every call from a landline or a mobile phone to be snooped upon, and every text message, email and internet search history to be collected and scrutinized.[^249] And finally, the arrival in India of companies like Verint with dubious pasts and Raytheon with scary technology, compounded by think tanks plumped like leeches on blood money from the defence industry or ideologically conservative funders hawk war and terrorism in their policy papers, briefs and television discussions.

From the furnace of this ideological and corporate interest is being minted the vision of a new state.
