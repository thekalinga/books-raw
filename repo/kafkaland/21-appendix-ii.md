## Appendix II

`On 9 February 2006, the Delhi Police Special Cell "arrested' Maurif Qamar and Md. Irshad Ali, accusing them of being the operatives of a terrorist organization, Al Badr. Qamar and Ali moved the High Court seeking a CBI probe, which was granted. The CBI investigations showed that both were actually police informers who were assigned the task of infiltrating terrorist organizations in Jammu and Kashmir. Irshad Ali wrote this letter to the Prime Minister while lodged in the high security cell of the Tihar jail. Iftikhar Gilani has translated it into English from the original Urdu.`

>The Prime Minister of India

>Dear Sir,
>
>I am writing this letter from the confinement of Tihar Jail with the aim to save innocent youth from getting trapped into the net woven by unscrupulous men in the security agencies to earn rewards and promotions in the name of fighting terrorism. I hope it will help people and your readers and enable them to largely save themselves. Let me introduce myself. My name is Irshad Ali Slo Mohamamd Yunus incarcerated in Ward No. 5 (High Risk Ward) Cell No. 13 in Jail No. 8 of Delhi's Tihar Jail.
>
>Many of you may have recently read my story in The _Times of India_ dated September 13, 2007 citing a CBI report confirming that IB and Special Cell of Delhi Police had framed us. But, I suspect if the CBI report goes further and nails the actual culprits.
>
>I was working as an Informer for the Special Cell of Delhi Police, which works closely with the IB to nab terrorists. Having worked closely with them, I feel duty bound to appraise the nation of the working of these agencies and how they manufacture terrorists. They have made the war on terrorism a total farce. Have you ever noticed how quick our agencies are in nabbing the culprits even before they strike? But, how interesting it is that still they have not yet been able to lay their hands on any terrorist involved in Mumbai and Delhi blasts? Why? I have answers.
>
>In order to keep their ranks and earn rewards, Special Cell creates terrorists. I will tell you how these agencies work. They have employed a number of youth, on a very paltry remuneration. They are not regular employees, but just vagabonds, who are given mobile phones and protection. They are asked to fan out and hire accommodation somewhere in the city. They mingle with unemployed youth and befriend people around. After identifying vulnerable targets, they form a group, arrange weapons and incite these youth to go for a robbery. Special Cell secretively also provides them a stolen vehicle, which is procured from known car thieves.
>
>These youth who vest all their trust in the Special Cell agent finally one day decide to go for an operation. Upon reaching the target, they are trapped in the net, like a fish. At the targeted place, Police is already there to receive them and they are all nabbed without resistance. Interestingly, the agent, who is also a mastermind, never gets in police trap and he successfully vanishes. Medals and bravery awards follow.
>
>An interesting aspect of this whole episode remains that these youth never realize the truth behind their arrest. They curse their luck and resign to their fate spending years in imprisonment.
>
>Now, let me shed some light on the working of the Intelligence Bureau (IB). This is the most useless agency which does nothing, but to feed the government and media with concocted stories. That earns them crores of rupees from the government besides special powers. And they are least accountable because every thing is done in a secretive manner. You may have heard often stories like; a dozen terrorists have landed in Delhi; halfa-dozen terrorists are roaming in Mumbai; ISI is taking roots in UP etc.
>
>Now to back their claims, a Maulvi type agent sporting a long beard and well versed with Islamic tenets is launched in some Muslim locality. Most often, the Maulvi either takes a rented accommodation near a mosque or in some cases makes mosque itself an abode. The pious nature of the Maulvi, his praying five times a day and some heart-rending story easily earns him sympathy and attention. He starts befriending particularly educated Muslim youth. Slowly he identifies targets, harangues them with anti-India and anti-government lectures, laments over condition of Muslims and emphasizes the need for waging jihad.
>
>One day, he confides to the group, that he was actually a Commander of Lashkar-e Tayyaba (LeT) or some other organization. These youth, who are already brainwashed and enticed, now a in fit of emotions believe in the agent. Small weapons are distributed amongst them with a partial training of their working. Meanwhile, ammunition and vehicles and other things arrive. The agent is in touch with the sleuths in the IB and reports to them with minute to minute happenings.
>
>Finally, when the stage is set, the Commander calls for an operation. Even a recce is done. Meanwhile, the IB informs the Special Cell, who put a trap at the targeted place. These youth fall in their lap like ripe fruits without any resistance along with arms and ammunition. They never know how they got into the police net. When police raids to nab their Commander, he is already back with the IB to explore newer pastures. He is never found. A terse news follows that so many terrorists were arrested and one managed to give police a slip.
>
>These trapped youth curse themselves and feel guilty for rest of their life. Special Cell officers tell them that their crimes demand that they be killed in fake encounter, but having mercy on them, "we will send you to jail, where you will get out within six, seven years." These people also remain indebted to police, without knowing the background.
>
>There are also cases where police plants incriminatory things like explosives, drugs on the detainees. The question remains where they get such things. It is quite easy. For example, if someone is caught with a fake currency Rs. 50 lakh. Since the punishment for Rs. 50 lakh or five lakh is same, it does not matter for the Police whether to charge the accused for a lower or a higher sum. They will charge the accused for just Rs. 5 lakh, who for lack of knowledge of law also remains indebted to them. Rest Rs. 45 lakh fake currency is deposited in the safe confines and later planted on victims. Same is the case with smack, heroin, explosives and everything.
>
>Both the Special Cell and the IB have procured huge farm houses in the vicinity of Delhi to undertake unlawful activities. Those destined to be killed in fake encounters are not kept in police stations or at known facilities, they are lodged in these farm houses. They are detained for months and years there before they are killed at some appropriate time".
>
>These encounters usually take place in the evening or dead of night. A stolen vehicle and a gun is recovered. Those victims who are killed in such encounters are kidnapped in such a way that nobody knows their whereabouts. The sleuths also take care that no case is lodged against this kidnapping. If there is hue and cry, they will wait for things to cool down. The police of different states also exchange victims with each other. In every state, you have now special branches or cells or squads who directly take orders from the IB.
>
>For example, Special Cell of Delhi Police will take two Kashmiris from the Special Operations Group (SOG) of Jammu and Kashmir Police and in exchange give them two persons from this side, who are killed in Kashmir branding them Pakistanis. Since they never get recognized and local people also show indifference, police stories look credible.
>
>Since this game is played at a very high level, local police is a mute spectator. Most of the time they don't even know what is happening. Most of the time local police also treats it as a usual kidnapping case, when the families lodge complaint.
>
>With all authority, I want to inform you that encounter orders come from higher authorities in the Home Ministry and all security agencies know an encounter is being managed on a particular day. A team which is designed to inspect the scene of encounter and report whether it was fake or not, prepares its report in advance, making this exercise also farce.
>
>Have you ever noticed that those killed in encounters carry all their details, their name, rank in the organization etc. in their pockets when they face encounter? Further, they die even without firing a bullet and even if they fire, it never hits the target. Our police needs to be appreciated that during past few years in almost 100 encounters, not a single personnel was ever injured. Compare it with the army's encounters with real terrorists in Kashmir. In almost every battle, one or two personnel get bullet wounds.
>
>It speaks, either our army is not as trained as the Special Cell of Delhi Police, or the encounter is fake. If the Police insists on genuineness of these encounters, then I suggest, they be posted in Kashmir to replace army. People of this nation will also realize their bravery.
>
>I will tell you how brave our Special Unit is. If they ever come to know that a miscreant is armed with a knife, they will never dare to go close to him. They will only nab him, when they are confident that the miscreant is unarmed. I have worked as their informer. They would make sure from us that the culprit is totally unarmed when they go to apprehend him.
>
>Dear Sir, the Special Cell is a group of licensed marauders. They have been highly communalized. They are venomous against Muslims. They hardly bother that somebody's family gets ruined, they are only concerned with their own rewards. Let me say, these Special Cell personnel are just human bodies with an animal soul. And to speak of their torture techniques, it is beyond your imagination. Even more brutal than you see in films.
>
>My only fault is that I refused to go along with them too long. They know, in the name of Islamic terrorism, you can book anyone, plant explosive, give name of some organization and make some hue and cry in the media. Rest with great distress, I am pained to say, our courts too fall in line. I was in their confinement for over two months. When my father lodged a complaint in local police station and the family of my coaccused Nawab S/o Qamar gave a look-out notice on TV, then they produced us claiming, "we nabbed them with explosives when they were returning after two month training". We challenged it in the High Court. High Court later directed the CBI to inquire, which has submitted its preliminary report. I don't think they will go too far to book their cousins in the IB and Special Cell. For past one-and-half year, we have been identifying the place, where we were kept for two months. But, they are deliberately ignoring to put it on record.
>
>I appeal to the Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh to step in and put a stop on such activities. These agencies are not securing the country, but making it extremely insecure. Those youth, who could contribute in nation building, are consigned to jails or encounters. If we book a young man with dreams to do something for a nation, in a fake case and make him a terrorist, it is foolish to believe that he remains loyal to you.
>
>People who are jailed in such fake cases do think that if they ought to be punished heavily, then it was better for them to get arrested after really doing something. This is a dangerous trend. A rebellious thinking takes over. Even if they are released, no one is ready to own them.
>
>Dear Prime Minister, it is high time to give a message to your security agencies. Fire can never douse fire. It needs water. Your security agencies are dousing fire with petrol.
>
>I wish you to read the CBI report which has been submitted in the High Court, which clearly mentions names of the IB officers for whom I was working as an informer. And who also kidnapped me.
>
>Here are names and number of officials for whom I was working:
>
>* IB officer Khalid alias Majid 9810702004
>* IB officer Aftab 9810702004
>* ACP Sanjeev Yadav 9810058002
>* Inspector Lalit Mohan, Hardev Bhushan 9811980604, 8711980601
>* They had given me also a mobile phone with SIM 9873303646
>* My mobile for talking to IB officers 9873131845
>
>It is not difficult for any agency or the media to get details of calls from these numbers to dig out truth.
>
>Yours only
