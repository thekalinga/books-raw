# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

We
are especially indebted to
Beth Vesel, our agent,
who came up
with the idea for this book and then
persuaded us to do it. We appreciate our publisher, Jeremy Tarcher, and
his vision of the book's direction. Our editor, Rick Benzel, encouraged
Tarcher/Putnam to take on the project and has steered us through the
maze of publishing. Daniel Malvin, Tarcher/Putnam's Managing Editor,
helped us on the homestretch with his consummate professionalism and
good humor.

The authors are responsible for the contents of the book, but owe a
debt of gratitude to many people who have helped us over the years. We
want to thank several generations of editors of the _Chicago Sun-Times_, particularly
Mark Nadler, Dennis Britton, Mary Dedinsky, and Alan Mutter.
We are grateful to Ann Allen, Mark Bloom, Alan Blum, Arthur Caplan,
David Carlson, Daniel Childs, Eugene Diamond, John Easton, Marc
Edell, Norman Gevitz, Robert Graham, Robert King, Jane Larson, George
McAndrews, Sharon McGowan, Jim McGowan, Kara McNamara, Joe
Neel, Deborah Nelson, Chuck Neubauer, Peggy Peck, David Rogers,
Benjamin Schatz, Eric Solberg, Ann Springer, Joseph Stanton, Patricia
Spain Ward, Linda Johnson White, Judith Wolinsky, Quentin Young, and
Tom Young.

We owe a debt to libraries, which we found are hothouses for more
books. We want to thank the following libraries and their staffs: the
American Medical Association library, the Homewood Public Library,
the Suburban Library System, the Harold Washington Library (especially
the Government Documents department), the _Chicago Sun-Times_
Library, the John Crerar Library and Regenstein Library at the University
of Chicago, and the University of Oregon Library.

We also owe thanks to the National Library on Money & Politics, especially
Jacqueline Duobinis, for helping tame Federal Election Commission
data, and to _American Health Line_ and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
for providing service for a year.

We wanted to show our appreciation to some staffers at the American
Medical Association who shared documents and insights. However,
they asked that their names not be mentioned. They feared retribution.
Likewise, we are grateful to the AMA moles, people within the organization
who over the years anonymously have passed along tips and leaked
documents.
