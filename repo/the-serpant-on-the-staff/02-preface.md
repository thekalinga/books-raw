# PREFACE[^0/0]

The headquarters of the American
Medical Association is just down the block from the _Chicago SunTimes_,
where we have worked as reporters for the past decade. Howard
Wolinsky is a medical reporter who probably knows the AMA as well, if
not better, than most reporters. Tom Brune is an investigative reporter
who has teamed up with Wolinsky to ferret out hidden information for a
variety of projects. Being in the AMA's backyard, we have covered the
AMA the way some reporters cover City Hall.

We have reported on AMA policies as they have been formulated. We
were there when the AMA announced its proposal to reform the healthcare
system and its first policies on AIDS. We wrote about controversies
involving an _AMA Journal_ article by an anonymous physician who wrote
an account of a mercy killing. We have plumbed the AMA's own research
for nuggets, such as the first time physicians' average pay exceeded
$100,000 and $150,000. (That happened in 1983 and 1989, respectively.)

We have also reported on the internal foibles and hypocrisies of this
large national institution. There was the 1981 piece on how AMA
resident-physician members were upset over the incongruity of the
AMA's Members Retirement Fund owning more than $1 million in tobacco
stocks. After this was publicized, the AMA quietly sold the securities
off. There was the story in 1985 about how the _AMA Journal_'s editor
in chief knuckled under to pressure from a drug manufacturer, who had
withdrawn advertising for several months, and ran an article extolling
the virtues of one of the firm's products. The AMA fired the _Journal_'s
news editor of fifteen years for speaking about the incident to the newspaper---even
though she first obtained AMA permission to do so.

Then, there was the story about how the AMA planned to print articles
rejected by its journals in "educational" publications designed to
bring in millions of dollars from drug companies. The AMA already is
hooked on pharmaceutical-company advertising, which makes up about
20 percent of its operating revenue, second only to members' dues as a
source of AMA funding. Consumerist Dr. Sidney Wolfe characterized
this project as "massive prostitution." The AMA dropped this project.
And there was the story that showed how the AMA's top brass tried to
prevent friction with conservative members of Congress by ordering
_JAMA_'s editor to back off on articles concerning three "particularly sensitive
political issues: abortion, tobacco, and nuclear war.

We broke a series of stories in 1989--90 on financial scandals involving
the AMA's top managers. The articles resulted in the resignation in
disgrace of the AMA's chief executive, Dr. James H. Sammons, then one
of America's best-known medical politicians. The president of the AMA's
for-profit subsidiary and a top investment executive also were forced out.
Then we covered the organization's efforts to redefine itself as "The New
AMA,"a "friendlier, wiser" version of an organization notorious for confrontation,
ultimatums, and hardball politics. The changes came at a fortunate
time for the AMA, which was cultivating a new image when the
country finally appeared to be trying to address the problems of access
and high cost that have turned the health-care system into a nightmare
for many Americans. But it looks like the New AMA is just the Old AMA
in freshly laundered surgical scrubs.

No organization appreciates outside scrutiny by a news organization.
The AMA, which largely has been left to its own devices by the general
media, is no different. The AMA's press office and leadership prefer to
choose how and when to enter the public spotlight. Our brand of adversarial
journalism prompted the AMA communications director to refer
to Wolinsky as "a snake" to the AMA Board of Trustees because of a
story---based on AMA statistics---they did not like. As a result, "Snake"
became the reporter's nickname among his medical-writer colleagues.

Having done this type of reporting over the years, we now have
taken on the job of writing a book covering the AMA from a broader
perspective. This book is a reporters' book, but we are going beyond reporting
of news to analyzing how the AMA has affected the lives of
Americans. The public should know more about a major organization
that is attempting to play an important part in the health-reform effort
that will affect all of us as well as coming generations.

There have been plenty of books about medicine over the years. But
there has not been an independent book aimed at the general reader
that examined the AMA on a wide range of topics since journalist James
Rorty wrote _American Medicine Mobilizes_ in 1939. Historian James G.
Burrow published a scholarly historical account, AMA: _Voice of American
Medicine_, in 1963. Journalist Richard Harris wrote A Sacred Trust in 1966,
providing an account of the AMA's efforts to block passage of the Medicare
law. Although not specifically about the AMA, Paul Starr's 1982
opus, _The Social Transformation of American Medicine_, contains much of the
history of the AMA in its excellent analysis of U.S. health care. We are
indebted to these authors, and many, many others.

The most recent book about the AMA was an inside job, published in
1984. AMA public-relations executive and former _Life_ magazine writer
Frank D. Campion wrote an AMA-approved book tracing AMA activities
from 1940 to the early 1980s. Campion had easy access to his colleagues
and tells some revealing stories about the AMA.

This book is not authorized by the AMA and never was intended to
receive the AMA's seal of approval. However, we approached the AMA in
spring 1992 in hopes of getting some cooperation for this project. Chief
Executive James S. Todd welcomed us, urging us to write about the AMA,
its "warts and roses." But as is common in books like this, communications
broke down. AMA officials did not like the nature of our questions
and were unhappy that we did not provide them with a written outline of
the book. Still, the AMA allowed us to use its library and gave us copies of
its public statements.

However, AMA officials told us that our formal requests for interviews
with AMA Board members and staffers would be at the bottom of
the large stack of media inquiries. The AMA does not grant official interviews
without approval from its public-relations office. In our case, the
AMA said it would honor requests only when, as an AMA publicrelations
officer frankly said, "We can put a positive spin on it." Many of
our requests essentially were ignored.

HOW THE BOOK WAS DONE

We pushed on. We asked questions for the book during interviews on
other subjects with AMA officials and at press conferences. All together,
we interviewed more than one hundred people, including current and
former AMA staffers and Board members, AMA critics, and academics
from a host of disciplines including medicine, the law, ethics, history, and
sociology. We have gone over thousands of pages of court documents
and congressional testimony. We have pored over thousands of pages
obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from the Centers for
Disease Control, the Federal Election Commission, the General Services
Administration, and other federal agencies. We still are on the waiting list
for the FBI to answer our freedom-of-information request. We also have
read dozens of books and reports, as well as hundreds of articles relating
to the AMA and the issues we cover in the book.

In the end, the AMA agreed to grant an interview with Todd only if
the AMA could review and comment the section of the book in which
this was used. The authors reluctantly agreed to that condition. After
months of waiting, we interviewed Todd. The results of the interview are
in the epilogue.

In _The Serpent on the Staff_, we have explored how the AMA has shaped
our nation's health-care system and the role it has played in the major
medical issues of our time. We have taken a historic look to trace the
development of policy and to look for the organization's patterns of behavior
over time. The AMA has played an important role in defining
what health care is and how it is delivered in the United States. Before we
can begin to talk about how to change our faltering health-care system,
we should know how it got to be that way.

This book presents a critical view of the AMA. Our thesis is that the
AMA is not a paternalistic Dr. Welby looking out after his patients. We see
the AMA as more often than not a political entity that claims to be tending
to the public's health, while in reality looking after doctors' interests.
However, what's good for the AMA and its members is not necessarily
good for the U.S.A. That's why our subtitle refers to the unhealthy politics
of the AMA.

## PREVIEW OF CHAPTERS

The first half of the book is devoted primarily to financial and political
issues; the second half deals with how AMA politicos respond to health
issues.

_Chapter 1_ provides an overview of the AMA, its organization, its
membership, and how it works.

_Chapter 2_ describes the AMA's role in blocking, delaying, and weakening
health-care reform. The AMA in the present as well as the past engaged
in well-financed lobbying and scare tactics to fight and control
reform.

_Chapter 3_ examines the one major battle the AMA lost when it tried to
derail an idea whose time had come, Medicare, and how the AMA helped
turned this defeat into a victory by ensuring that Medicare was a financial
windfall for doctors. The AMA will try to repeat this success with whatever
health reform comes.

_Chapter 4_ is devoted to AMPAC, the AMA's powerful political action
committee, which has spent almost incomprehensible amounts of money
to help the AMA get its way.

In _Chapter 5_ we look at how the AMA has tried to keep alive the business
ethic---and the opportunities to profit off patients---which ought to
be antithetical to healers.

Next, in _Chapter 6_, AMA opposition to alternative medicine is explored.
The evidence is presented here of how the AMA, in pursuing its
own political and economic goals, has attempted to eradicate competing
schools of medicine.

_Chapter 7_ is about one of the more egregious and callous cases of the
AMA's unhealthy politics in action---its involvement with tobacco, the
cause of the largest epidemic of our time. To this day, though the AMA
has a solid antitobacco record on paper, many health advocates view the
AMA as being "soft" on tobacco.

Next, in _Chapter 8_, abortion, perhaps the most contentious of
medical-political issues, is studied by following the AMA's evolution from
being an advocate for criminalizing abortion in the last century to its current
efforts to duck this divisive issue with major moral and public health
implications.

_Chapter 9_ describes the AMA's role in another complicated and explosive
issue, AIDS. After long ignoring the growing epidemic, the AMA
often tried to promote political rather than scientific remedies with its
AIDS policies.

## THE SNAKE: SYMBOL OF HEALING

The title of this book, _The Serpent on the Staff_, is a reference to the AMA's
symbol. In 1910 the AMA began using as its logo a snake entwined upon
a knotty pine staff.

Since ancient times, the serpent has symbolized medicine. It is not
the serpent of the Judeo-Christian culture, which viewed snakes as a
symbol of evil, but of the ancient Greeks and Romans. To them, the
snake's ability to shed its skin was a powerful image for renewal and healing.
In Greek mythology, Asklepios, the son of the god Apollo and the
mortal Coronis, had the ability to metamorphose into a snake. He was a
potent healer who could bring the dead back to life, which angered Hades,
god of the underworld. In one tale Asklepios changed into a serpent so
he could be carried to Rome to end a plague. After this, the Romans
made him a god too, Aesculapius, and built temples in his honor. The
ruins of hundreds of these temples still can be found in Italy and Greece,
some still populated by snakes. Asklepios also is credited with leading
medicine toward science and away from primitive shamanistic practices.
The modern medical doctor can be considered a descendant of
Asklepios.

The AMA's logo featured an Asklepian viper, a wiry serpent, looking
fierce with fangs and a forked tongue. But in 1990 the AMA decided it
was time to go through its own transformation, to shed the skin of its
past, to renew its image in the eyes of doctors and the public. It was a
form of rebirth after the AMA was devastated by a financial scandal involving
its top leaders. As part of an $800,000 image-building campaign,
the AMA unveiled its new icon. The new serpent-on-the-staff appeared
friendlier. The tongue and fangs were gone. The snake also appeared to
be plumper and better-fed. And the AMA's new logo had added a slogan:
"Physicians dedicated to the health of America."

The timing of the AMA's "rebirth" was important. The AMA was
positioning itself for the great health-care debate. At the beginning of
the 1990s, the United States entered into its sixth attempt in this century
to reform the health-care system, to make it more accessible to those
without the means to pay for their care, to make it more affordable for
the country as a whole. Like all the other powerful special interests whose
members provide care and profit from a huge industry, the AMA needed
to put itself into a better bargaining position. To do this, it had to escape
any scrap of a reputation it has as a trade association that put the political
and economic interests of physicians ahead of all else.

As the citizens of the United States observe and participate in the
drive for health-care reform, they owe it to themselves to know the players
and what they stand for. Among the key players is the American Medical
Association. Its power, though not nearly as great as it was a few
decades ago, cannot be underestimated. In discussing the plight of those
without health insurance, Princeton medical economist Uwe E. Reinhardt
once said, "What the head of the AMA thinks in the shower in the
morning is so much more important than the aspirations of 10 million
Americans."

## THE OTHER SNAKE: SYMBOL OF BUSINESS

There is another symbol of medicine that frequently is confused with the
Asklepian serpent-on-the-staff. It is the caduceus, which has two snakes
twisted around a short olive-tree wand with wings. The single-serpent
and double-serpent symbols often are treated as if they are the same. Indeed,
many physicians use these symbols interchangeably on their letterheads,
prescription pads, or on signs in front of their office buildings.
Newspapers and television stations often incorporate the two-snake symbol
into their logos for medical stories, unaware of the history of the two
symbols.

The two emblems have very different meanings. The caduceus is the
shield of Mercury, the Roman god of communications, known as
Hermes to the Greeks. Mercury has tenuous links to medicine. His symbol,
with the two fighting snakes held at bay, is that of the messenger or
herald, a peacemaker who was not to be attacked by warring parties. In
the nineteenth century, some medical branches of the U.S. military dabbled
with the caduceus as a symbol of their noncombatant status. The
U.S. Army Medical Department made the double snake its emblem in
1902. From there, physicians and others involved in medicine, apparently
thinking it represented healing, adopted the shield of Mercury. In
fact, the AMA briefly flirted with the symbol itself, having it sculpted into
a façade near the front entrance of its headquarters building constructed
in 1902.

However, Mercury has some connotations that are rather unflattering
for the healing professions. Mercury was a trickster, who often lied
his way out of jams. He also was the protector of thieves and businessmen,
dating from an era when profits were considered a form of stealing.

Despite their differences, the confusion about the two symbols is understandable.
In reality, they represent two sides of medicine and the
American Medical Association. There is no doubt that physicians, in the
Asklepian tradition, are members of a healing profession, offering comfort,
alleviating suffering, and saving lives. But doctors also are in the
business of running offices and making money. Like all who are engaged
in commerce, doctors face the temptations of Mercury's darker side to
boost the bottom line and add to their personal gain.

_The Serpent on the Staff_ is written for those readers who want to see
through the imagery and mythology to discover the reality of the AMA.
