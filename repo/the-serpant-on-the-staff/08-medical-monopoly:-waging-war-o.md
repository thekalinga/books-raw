# Medical Monopoly: Waging War on Alternative Medicine[^6/0]

Since its founding in the midnineteenth
century, the American Medical Association, with its M.D.knows-best
doctrine, has attempted to root out quacks and snake-oil
salesmen. Charlatans who prey upon the public ought to be eliminated.
However, the AMA also had other, more selfish and cynical motivations
in attacking all varieties of alternative healers, who after all competed to
some extent with its members. These included protecting the financial
interests of orthodox practitioners and supplying the divided factions
within mainstream medicine with a common enemy against whom they
could rally.

By helping medical doctors ascend the throne of medicine, politically
and economically, the AMA has contributed to the elimination or
suppression of competing healers. Because of these interventions, insurance
covers unorthodox care only on a limited basis, if at all, and the research
establishment has largely ignored what unconventional medicine
might have to offer. Still, some alternative medical approaches have
beaten the odds to survive in the shadow of a menacing AMA, and many
Americans opt for alternative medicine because they find mainstream,
AMA-style medicine unsatisfactory.[^6/1]

The AMA has conducted a nearly 150-year war against alternative
medicine. In its earliest years, the AMA, representing one of a number
of competing medical approaches, led the so-called regular doctors to
market dominance by the turn of this century. Despite the virtual monopoly
of regular medicine, the AMA continued to battle the alternative
practitioners. Having been badly bloodied in its defeat on Medicare in
the 1960s, the AMA launched an all-out war on chiropractic, the most
successful of contemporary alternatives.

## DEFENDER OF THE TRUE FAITH

Most Americans see doctors who practice what technically is known as
allopathic medicine. Allopathy, marked by the use of medicine and surgery
and by an allegiance to the scientific method, holds itself up in nearreligious
terms as the one true faith, dismissing as cults groups that subscribe
to other approaches. But allopathy actually is the majority party;
there are now and have always been multiple schools of medical thought.
Allopathy is simply the AMA brand of medicine, which experienced a
serendipitous rise in an era in which scientific knowledge began to soar.

Before the AMA arrived on the scene in the late 1840s, allopathy was
far from being assured dominance. There had been a teeming marketplace
of medical theories: one school advocated a highly democratized
system in which each person was his or her own physician; another promoted
the use of plants as remedies; another used steam therapy and
Native American medicines; and yet another, the "eclectics," borrowed
from other sects whatever techniques they considered beneficial.

Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in the early nineteenth century founded
the once very popular type of medicine known as homeopathy. Hahnemann's
theory was based on the concept of like cures like. He and his colleagues
developed an extensive catalog of remedies, which from selftesting
they determined elicited symptoms similar to the diseases.
Homeopaths (the term comes from the Greek meaning "like disease")
gave their patients highly diluted doses of their remedies in hopes of
effecting cures

Hahnemann gave the competing school, allopathy, its name. In contrast
with homeopaths, Hahnemann said allopaths (Greek for "other
treatment," a put-down that stuck) gave their patients harsh purgatives
and bled them to counter the effects of disease and injury. As a reform
movement, homeopathy was in demand because its remedies did not
have the dangerous side effects associated with allopathy, whose "heroic"
treatments often were deadly.

Homeopaths underwent training equal to or even superior to that of
allopaths. Not surprisingly, the popularity of homeopathy and other socalled
irregular medical groups drew fire from allopaths, whose income
and status were threatened. In forming the AMA, the allopaths nominally
wanted to improve medical education and to fight quackery, but the
counterculture of that era viewed these as wink terms for a campaign to
wipe out irregular physicians, particularly homeopaths. At its founding
in 1847, the AMA established ethical prohibitions against consulting
with homeopaths and other irregular physicians. This policy led to a dispute
_within_ allopathy. The Medical Society of the State of New York was
booted out of the AMA in 1882 because the group had dropped the ban
against consulting with homeopathis. The next year, doctors attending
the AMA meeting were forced to sign a pledge to adhere to the AMA's
original ethical code barring such professional exchanges.

During its first half century, the AMA had failed in its anti-quackery
efforts because it was unable to enforce its pronouncements against irregulars.
Meanwhile, many allopaths, recognizing the success of the
competition, dropped purgatives and bloodletting and adopted homeopathic
remedies.

Ironically, the death knell for the strongest irregular groups sounded
as allopaths joined forces with homeopaths and eclectics in the late 1800s
to advocate licensing of doctors. In _The Social Transformation of American
Medicine_, sociologist Paul Starr said regular physicians recognized that
only by collaborating with homeopaths and eclectics could they "win licensing
laws that would protect all of them against competition from untrained
practitioners." His argument is that it is a myth that the dominant
allopaths suppressed homeopaths and eclectics. Rather, he said, once homeopaths
and eclectics gained licensing recognition and seemed more
like allopaths, their public acceptance plummeted. By gaining mainstream
recognition and becoming more like allopaths, the homeopaths
and eclectics committed professional suicide.

Having divided and conquered the irregulars, the AMA was on its
way to being recognized as organized medicine. By the turn of the century,
the AMA and allopathic medicine had become king of the hill as the
leading medical sects declined and were absorbed, and mainstream medicine
was making and exploiting scientific discoveries.

### New Enemies: Osteopaths and Chiropractors

By the time the AMA had succeeded with passage of state laws to license
physicians, at the end of the nineteenth century, two other groups began
to emerge to fill the void for those seeking alternatives. The two
approaches, osteopathic medicine and chiropractic, both used spinal
manipulation to treat disease. The AMA viewed both as quacks and did
what it could to block them.[^6/2]

Dr. Andrew Still, a frontier doctor, was dissatisfied with both allopathy
and its irregular competitors. He set out to develop his own type of
medicine. In 1874, based on a divine revelation and study of bones dug
up from Indian burial grounds, Still left mainstream medicine behind
and began advocating a nondrug, hands-on approach involving spinal
manipulation, which he dubbed osteopathy. He contended that misplaced
spinal bones interfered with nerves controlling the blood supply
to the organs. Because Still wanted his followers to be general practitioners,
osteopaths soon enlarged their skills by learning minor surgery
and obstetrics. Eventually they became more like M.D.s, expanding their
scope of practice to include major surgery and use of drugs. The osteopaths
ultimately rejected some of their founder's theories and improved
their educational requirements.

Despite its efforts to upgrade itself, osteopathy remained a pariah
in allopathic eyes. In the 1920s the AMA began to describe osteopaths
as cultists with whom AMA members should not associate professionally.
The AMA, which viewed osteopathic education as second rate,
barred doctors of osteopathy (D.O.s) from AMA membership and tried
to block osteopaths from obtaining hospital privileges and participating
in government-funded medical programs. The AMA was refining its
bag of tricks to attack alternative healers. As much as the American
Medical Association may have despised osteopathy, homeopathy, and
other unconventional practices, it saved its strongest venom for chiropractic.

### An Unscientific Cult[^6/3]

The AMA considered all chiropractors quacks. In the AMA view, chiropractors
were followers of an "unscientific cult" because they accepted
heretical theories espoused by chiropractic founder D. D. Palmer. The
one-time grocer---his enemies liked to dismiss him as a fishmonger---and
"magnetic healer" held that disease had "one cause and one cure." The
cause of disease, so chiropractic theory went, was subluxations, misalignments
of the spinal vertebrae that interfered with the normal flow of
nerve energy. Chiropractic's "cure" consisted of the forceful thrusts of
spinal manipulation, known as "adjustments," to restore vertebrae to
their normal position. In his 1925 book on quackery, _The Medical Follies_,
Dr. Morris Fishbein, longtime editor of the _Journal of the AMA_ and the
person most identified with AMA views from the 1920s through the
1940s, described chiropractic as a "malignant tumor." Fishbein belittled
chiropractic theory as a reversion to the original ideas of osteopathy, "so
simple that even farm-hands can grasp it."[^6/4]

Chiropractic also had a spiritual or metaphysical foundation, which
made science-oriented physicians cringe. Once the spinal bones were in
place, "an intelligent life-force," referred to as the "Innate" by Palmer,
was unleashed and brought about healing. "Innate is part of the Creator.
Innate spirit is part of Universal Intelligence," said Palmer. Chiropractors
said they restored the normal harmony of misaligned bones to allow
spiritual energy to heal the body.

However, in allopathic medicine's view, chiropractors, with their peculiar
language and theories, might as well have been from another planet.
Medical doctors, trained to consider themselves as scientists, spurned
chiropractic theory as gibberish. The mainstream elite also looked down
its nose at chiropractors because they underwent an inferior education,
with many students in the early days entering chiropractic school with a
high-school diploma. There also was a class difference because while
many M.D.s came from the middle or upper classes, many doctors of chiropractic
(D.C.s) came from blue-collaror rural backgrounds.

Medical doctors said chiropractic at best was a harmless placebo and
at worst kept patients from potentially lifesaving therapy. They also were
disgusted with chiropractors' penchant for advertising and promotion.
While many M.D.s did not advertise at all and others restricted themselves
to business-card ads listing name, address, and specialty, some chiropractors
made flamboyant and even outrageous claims for cures for
cancer and sponsored silly promotions, such as straight-spine contests.
With the outlook of the gentrified M.D. elite, Fishbein observed: "It
has been said that osteopathy is essentially a method of entering the
practice of medicine by the back door. Chiropractic, by contrast, is an attempt
to arrive through the cellar. The man who applies at the back door
at least makes himself presentable. The one who comes through the cellar
is besmirched with dust and grime; he carries a crowbar and he may
wear a mask."[^6/5]

For most of its history, chiropractic represented only a minor annoyance
to allopathy because there were relatively few D.C.s in the country,
and they were largely confined to small towns in the Midwest and on
the West Coast. But after World War II, veterans flooded chiropractic colleges,
and chiropractic began to assume a higher profile.

## CRACKING THE BACK OF CHIROPRACTIC

Chiropractors emerged in hordes in the 1950s and 1960s in Iowa,
the group's birthplace. A worried lowa Medical Society set out in 1962
to hobble chiropractic; it formed the Committee on Chiropractic to
fight chiropractors' efforts to advance themselves in the state legislature.
Robert B. Throckmorton, the medical society's general counsel,
guided the anti-chiropractic campaign. The lawyer was especially concerned
that the "mixers," a chiropractic faction, might be trespassing
on medicine's territory by expanding its scope of practice. Mixers
used spinal manipulation in combination with a variety of therapies,
such as application of heat and nutritional treatments. In contrast, traditional
"straight" chiropractors, who detested the mixers, used only spinal
manipulation. The mixers were rapidly becoming the majority
among D.C.s.[^6/6]

Throckmorton was not troubled by the straights, whose practices
were limited, but he feared the mixers would attempt to become _chiropractic
physicians and surgeons_. Such a scenario had unfolded before with
osteopathy, as one-time spinal manipulators metamorphosed into the
equals of medical doctors.

Based on his efforts in Iowa, Throckmorton urged that the crusade
against chiropractic go national. Speaking in Minneapolis in November
1962 to the North Central Medical Conference, a coalition of medical societies
in the upper Midwest, Throckmorton issued organized medicine
a call to arms against the "menace of chiropractic." He said medical societies
had to address "the chiropractic problem" through a comprehensive
program at the county, state, and national level. He said medical
doctors had not taken chiropractic seriously: "To physicians, chiropractic
is utterly ridiculous. Consequently, physicians have either ignored or
ridiculed chiropractic and let it go at that. ... The public is entitled to
have facts, figures, and scientific information about this cult and its practices
and limitations. The public does and should look to the medical
profession for unbiased and authoritative information on this subject.
Medicine has not fully met this responsibility."[^6/7]

Throckmorton called for a "positive program of 'containment.'"[^6/8]
He ticked off a list of areas medicine should concentrate on to stop chiropractic:
Oppose chiropractic efforts to be covered by health insurance
and workmen's compensation. Oppose chiropractic efforts to get hospital
privileges. Contain chiropractic schools. Encourage ethical complaints
against chiropractors. Resist chiropractic efforts to enhance its position
through legislation. Encourage disunity between the straights and
mixers.

Throckmorton wanted to cut chiropractic off at each point at which
it might better itself. He urged the AMA as well as local medical groups to
form anti-chiropractic committees. He said: "Action taken by the medical
profession should be firm, persistent and in good taste \[and\] behind
the scenes whenever possible."[^6/9]

### Quackery? Or Rallying Point?

While chiropractic probably posed a real threat to medical doctors'
pocketbooks in Iowa, the same could not be said in most of the United
States. The ratio of medical doctors to chiropractors was 4 to 1 in Iowa,
compared to 10 to 1 nationally. And there was no documentation that
chiropractic presented a genuine public health menace.

Still, Throckmorton's impassioned plea struck a chord in the AMA
leadership, which viewed a campaign against chiropractic as a flag under
which to rally the troops in troubled times when momentum was building
for Medicare. Throckmorton's vision met AMA expediencies. Within
a few months of his Minneapolis speech, he was hired as the AMA's
general counsel. He was a man with a mission. The American Medical
Association had always held itself up as a fierce foe of quackery and a
proponent of high ethical standards. But by the 1960s, AMA leaders
considered the departments that dealt with these issues to be comatose.
Dr. F. J. L. Blasingame, the AMA's chief executive, described the two sections,
the AMA's quackbusting Department of Investigation and the Department
of Ethics, as "sleeping giants." Blasingame told Throckmorton
his job was to "help these departments come alive."[^6/10]

## THE AMA CREATES A COMMITTEE ON QUACKERY

Like most institutions in the anti-establishment 1960s, the AMA found
itself under attack. Its meetings were disrupted by angry medical students
and were picketed by blacks, Latinos, the poor, and others with
gripes against organized medicine. The AMA was losing its grip on medicine
as well as being drained of its lifeblood-membership. Once an organization
doctors joined as a matter of course, the American Medical
Association was on its way to being unable to claim even half of America's
doctors as members. The AMA's hard-won dominance of medicine was
on the critical list.

AMA leaders recognized that they needed to rally the demoralized
troops. They hypothesized that a divided house would pull together to
fight a common enemy. [^6/11] When China is in trouble, it invades Tibet;
when the AMA is in trouble, it often launches unifying campaigns to take
on real or imagined enemies, such as competing health professions.

As early as September 1963, the AMA staff was gearing up to eliminate
chiropractic, with the official rationale of protecting the public's
health. Robert Youngerman, a Department of Investigation lawyer, said
in a memo to Throckmorton that chiropractors "present a clear and
present danger to the health and welfare of the public, and it would seem
that as guardians of our nation's health, doctors of medicine should be
dedicated to the _total elimination_ of any such unscientific cult." (Emphasis
added) To accomplish this goal, Youngerman suggested the formation of
a "Committee on Chiropractic."[^6/12]

The AMA Board agreed to the concept in November 1963, but
chose a different name for the panel. "Comınittee on Chiropractic"
sounded as though the AMA were establishing a diplomatic mission and
extending an olive branch to chiropractors. [^6/13] Instead, the AMA Board
held out the iron fist. It ordered that the panel, made up of medical doctors,
be called the Committee on Quackery. The goal of the new committee
was no less than to"contain and eliminate" chiropractic. [^6/14]

To energize the Department of Investigation and the new Committee
on Quackery, in January 1965, Throckmorton hired as department
director H. Doyl Taylor, an attorney by training and tough-talking city
editor of the _Des Moines Register_. In his new post, Taylor enthusiastically
went after all manner of quackery, from psychic surgeons in the Philippines
to arthritis and cancer quackery in Mexico.

Despite his Iowa roots, Taylor professed to know nothing about chiropractors
until he joined the AMA staff. "I didn't know a chiropractor
from an antelope," he would say. But when his superiors told him chiropractic
was a menace, he immediately recognized it as the "greatest
hazard to the public health. ... I opposed whatever the Committee instructed
me to oppose." [^6/15] One leading chiropractor later would portray
Taylor as "the AMA's Adolf Eichmann," a bureaucrat who followed
orders to destroy undesirables. [^6/16]

The AMA Department of Investigation and the Committee on
Quackery argued that existing AMA policy banning consultation with
cultists was too vague to carry on the fight against chiropractic. They
sought a "_necessary tool_," an explicit anti-chiropractic position from the
AMA's policy-setting House of Delegates. [^6/17] Taylor helped fashion a position
statement that for the first time specifically targeted chiropractors as
a hazard. In the aftermath of the divisive Medicare battle, the AMA's
House of Delegates in 1966 adopted the anti-chiropractic position, stating:
"It is the position of the medical profession that chiropractic is an
unscientific cult whose practitioners lack the necessary training and
background to diagnose and treat human disease. Chiropractic constitutes
a hazard to rational health care in the United States because of the
substandard and unscientific education of its practitioners and their
rigid adherence to an irrational, unscientific approach to disease causation."[^6/18]
With this single stroke, the AMA both declared itself the medical
profession and tarred chiropracticas quackery.

### Putting up Roadblocks

With AMA House endorsement, the Department of Investigation and
the Committee on Quackery carried out their assignment with renewed
zeal. Anywhere chiropractic made a showing, the AMA appeared---often
covertly---using its influence to try to counter, block, and stop the enemy.

Taylor enlisted the support of hundreds of medical groups for the
great war on chiropractic. He encouraged them to adopt ethical prohibitions
against M.D.s either referring patients to or consulting with D.C.s
The committee also worked to bar chiropractors from tax-supported
hospitals, to which some D.C.s wanted to refer patients for state-of-theart
X-ray studies. When Congress began considering paying chiropractors
for treating elderly patients under Medicare, the AMA collaborated
with its traditional foes on the Medicare issue, including the National
Council of Senior Citizens, the AFL-CIO, and the American Public
Health Association, to put up anti-chiropractic roadblocks. The AMA
urged these groups to take stands against chiropractic and then distributed
their anti-chiropractic positions, creating an anti-chiropractic bandwagon.

When chiropractic organizations sought federal approval for programs
to upgrade, standardize, and accredit chiropractic education, the
AMA stood at the Department of Education's door to try to bar their way.
Department of Investigation staffers even went undercover, taking assumed
names with appended D.C.s to spy on chiropractic conventions. [^6/19]

To "educate" the public and the medical profession, the Committee
on Quackery organized "quackery conferences" around the country to
focus on the menace of chiropractic. The AMA distributed antichiropractic
literature by the gross. It purchased 10,000 copies of
journalist Ralph Lee Smith's book _At Your Own Risk: The Case Against
Chiropractic_, which exposed some tragic abuses at the hands of chiropractors,
revealed the greed of some D.C.s, and ridiculed chiropractic
training and treatment. [^6/20] The AMA gave the book, which was partially
based on Department of Investigation files and Smith's writings in an
AMA magazine for consumers, to 1,000 of the nation's largest libraries.

In 1967 Congress asked the then Department of Health, Education
and Welfare to appoint a panel through the Public Health Service to advise
the government on whether chiropractors should be reimbursed
under the new Medicare program. It was decided that to prevent the appearance
of bias, no outside observers would be permitted, and that a
proposed caucus with AMA representatives would not be allowed. However,
as the study began in 1968, the AMA did everything it could to
"coach" and persuade committee members that chiropractic should not
be covered.

In a February 1968 letter, Taylor told Dr. Samuel Sherman, a member
of HEW's Health Insurance Benefits Advisory Council with strong
AMA links, "I'm sure you agree that the AMA hand must not 'show' in
this matter at this stage of the proposed chiropractic study. ... We must
guard against the possibility that HEW may decide to do only what is politically
expedient and include chiropractic 'as licensed at the state level;
or if a study is undertaken, admit chiropractic's totally unscientific testimonials."[^6/21]
Months before the study actually began, Sherman assured
Taylor that the final decision would be based upon chiropractic's "lack of
scientific merit."'[^6/22] And Dr. David Stevens, a member of the Committee
on Quackery, said in a memo that a federal official reticently explained in
a dinner meeting in October 1968 with Kentucky Medical Association
officials that AMA testimony was "unnecessary as the final answer has already
been determined."[^6/23]

The AMA also used an insider to determine which panelists were
"soft" on chiropractic so they could be "coached."[^6/24] Panelist Dr. John
McMillan Mennell, an expert on manipulative therapy from Jefferson
Medical College in Philadelphia, complained of receiving phone calls
"indirectly, but clearly inspired by, the American Medical Association,
implicitly suggesting what the tenor of my paper should be."[^6/25] He was
angered at the possibility that chiropractors might be penalized because
of "the bitter bias of the American Medical Association, when there is
substantial evidence that manipulative therapy brings relief to sufferers
from mechanical pain."[^6/26] In the initial vote on whether to recommend
that Congress approve Medicare coverage of chiropractic, the federal
panel split 4--4, but the final vote was changed to 5--3 against chiropractic
coverage
.
### Chiropractic Cries Foul

The divided camps of chiropractic charged that the panel was "fixed."
The International Chiropractors Association, representing the straights,
and the American Chiropractic Association, representing the mixer
camp, put aside their differences and released a May 1969 White Paper
in which they outlined their charges against the panel. They complained
that HEW's Ad Hoc Consultant Group and Expert Review Panel were
dominated by medical doctors and included no chiropractic representatives.

Thechiropractors said the federal report misrepresented chiropractic
education, noting that nearly three-quarters of chiropractic colleges
at the time required a minimum two years of prior college credit. The
report also stated the four-year chiropractic-education program devoted
more time to instruction in anatomy, physiology, radiology, rehabilitation,
nutrition, and public health than did the four-year course in medical
school. Further, the chiropractors rebutted the federal report by
noting that organized chiropractic had formally rejected the "one-cause,
one-cure" theory, which the AMA had long belittled.[^6/27]

Congress demanded a response from HEW, which claimed every
step possible was taken to prevent bias. In the meantime the AMA Department
of Investigation added the panel's negative report on chiropractic
to its so-called chiro kit, a package of anti-chiropractic
materials it sent to consumers and others inquiring about chiropractic.

Throughout this period, members of the Committee on Quackery
made disparaging speeches to build opposition to chiropractic. Dr.
Joseph A. Sabatier, chairman of the committee, hailed from Louisiana,
the only state in the early 1970s that did not license chiropractors. He
told a gathering of medical society officials that "rabid dogs and chiropractors
fit into about the same category. ... Chiropractors were nice
\[but\] they killed people."[^6/28]

The Department of Investigation and the Committee on Quackery
eventually backed off on the chiropractor-as-mad-dog-killer argument.
Taylor advised a national insurance association that it would be playing
with dynamite" if it went after the chiropractors' record with malpractice
suits.[^6/29] After all, based on the larger number of medical doctors and
the larger number of suits against them, the chiropractors were bound to
come out on top. Like other health professionals, chiropractors put their
patients at a certain amount of risk during treatment. A chiropractic
adjustment of the neck in rare instances can cause a stroke. And some
chiropractors resorting to ineffective or hazardous treatment could be
putting patients' lives in jeopardy by keeping them from lifesaving medical
therapies. But this problem was small in comparison to the dangers
posed by mainstream medicine. Medical doctors more frequently than
chiropractors engaged in potentially harmful, even deadly practices.
Nevertheless, Taylor encouraged the AMA's consumer magazine to print
articles---based on Department Investigation files---showing the dangers
of chiropractic quackery, such as chiropractors misdiagnosing cancers
and other life-threatening ailments.

The chiropractors did what they could to counter the attack. They
dispatched "truth squads" to tell their side to the press at hotels where
the AMA held its annual National Congress on Medical Quackery.[^6/30] Taylor,
the former newsman, was shocked when the media started to give
chiropractic equal time to answer AMA charges. The tide of battle was
about to turn, though in completely unexpected ways.

## THE AMA WAR BACKFIRES

In an unprecedented memo, on January 4, 1971, the Committee on
Quackery reported to the Board of Trustees that it was well on its way
toward achieving its first goal of containing chiropractic and was "moving
toward the ultimate goal" of eliminating the competing healers. The
committee also explained it had not submitted a progress report in the
first seven years of its existence because "to make public some of \[its\] activities
would have been and continues to be unwise."[^6/31]

Around the same time, over in Davenport, Iowa, Dr. Jerome
McAndrews, new on the job as executive vice president of the International
Chiropractors Association, was pondering the fate of his profession.
He had no way of knowing that an unusual parcel he received in the
mail would have direct bearing on the future of chiropractic and its AMA
antagonists. The package contained fifteen copies of a book entitled _In
the Public Interest_.[^6/32] The illustration on the book's cover immediately
riveted his attention: a Nazi swastika was superimposed on the AMA's
serpent-on-the-staff logo.

McAndrews, like most other chiropractors, believed his profession
was the victim of clandestine maneuvering by the AMA. The AMA had
long considered chiropractic quackery and an "unscientific cult"; however,
this book appeared to document that the AMA was doing more
than mouthing anti-chiropractic slogans. The book's thesis was that the
AMA was plotting to eradicate chiropractic. It described the AMA's antichiropractic
plan in detail and even reproduced internal memos supposedly
obtained by an anonymous reform-minded physician on staff at
the AMA. The paperwork from the AMA drones was enough to warm
the heart of any conspiracy buff. The book purported to show that the
AMA was intentionally wiping out a competing profession, not merely
fighting quackery,[^6/33]

The book began: "What you are about to read is not fiction. It is not
the inside story of the rise of the Third Reich, nor is it a figment of a
fanatic's fantasy of a communist conspiracy to take over America. What it
is, is truth, fully documented, of how the powerful American Medical
Association is going about doing away with one of the less powerful professions
in the healing arts, chiropractic."[^6/34] McAndrews could tell that
whoever put together the book had an ax to grind, though he wasn't sure
who the person was. He fretted that personal slurs aimed at AMA officials
undermined the book's credibility.

Furthermore, McAndrews never heard of William Trevor, the book's
author, nor Scriptures Unlimited, the book's Los Angeles-based publisher.
The book acknowledged the assistance of an obscure organization
known as Reform in Professional Organizations Freedom Foundation.
Only years later would a lawyer point out that the group's acronym was
an apparent joke---RIP-OFF. Though he couldn't be sure the material
was authentic, McAndrews intuited a ring of truth. As he paged through
the book, he realized it could help rally chiropractic's divided movement
and could crack what he believed was an AMA-led boycott that deprived
the public of the benefits of his group's unique type of health care.

When a representative of Scriptures Unlimited called to ask whether
he had received the books and whether his association would like to
reprint it, McAndrews arranged to buy the rights. He said a balding,
middle-aged man, casually dressed, wearing a leather jacket, collected
the $2,500 cashier's check from him. Fifteen thousand copies of the book
were printed. McAndrews made only one change, he removed the swastika.
_In the Public Interest_ created a stir in chiropractic circles but received
no attention elsewhere.

### A Chiropractor Calls for a Suit Against the AMA

Dr. Chester A. Wilk, a Chicago chiropractor, was touched by the book.
He had long held that medical doctors persecuted chiropractors and
their patients. For instance, his patients had tremendous difficulty obtaining
X rays at local hospitals in connection with chiropractic care, although
the facilities had been built with public funds. He felt AMA
prohibitions against professional cooperation between medical doctors
and chiropractors was harming his patients. The activities of the AMA
cabal outlined in _Public Interest_ substantiated his personal experience.

A year before the Trevor book came out in 1972, Wilk had begun
writing his own indictment of the AMA. The chiropractor, who has a
copy of the Bill of Rights displayed prominently in the living room in his
suburban Chicago home, in 1973 self-published _Chiropractic Speaks Out:
A Reply to Medical Propaganda, Bigotry and Ignorance_. [^6/35]

In his book, Wilk urged the AMA to stop engaging in monopolistic
practices and join with chiropractic to help patients. As he went around
the country promoting his book before local chiropractic groups, Wilk
began beating the drums for a lawsuit to end discrimination promoted by
the AMA and its fellow members of the medical establishment. Legal
action against the powerful allopaths was an unpopular notion in organized
chiropractic, which had lost an important lawsuit in 1965 before
the Supreme Court, through which it had attempted to force licensure of
chiropractors in Louisiana.[^6/36] Nonetheless, at the grass roots, thanks to
the feisty Wilk, a defense fund for a lawsuit was started in hopes of taking
on the AMA.

### "Sore Throat" Speaks

Wilk's efforts against the AMA got a boost in 1975 when an individual
dubbed Sore Throat sent a torrent of purloined AMA papers to reporters
at major media outlets, including the _New York Times_, the _New
York Daily News_, the _Washington Star_, the _Washington Post_, and the _Chicago
Sun-Times_, as well as to congressional committees and Dr. Sidney Wolfe,
cofounder with consumerist Ralph Nader of Public Citizen Health Research
Group. The internal documents revealed a pattern of seemingly
underhanded activities, indicating possible postal and tax abuses involving
the _Journal of the AMA_, apparent AMA manipulation of certain congressional
leaders, and battle plans for the war to"contain and eliminate"
chiropractic. Some of the documents relating to chiropractic were contained
in _Public Interest_, but the theatrics of Sore Throat, whom reporters
found to be highly credible because his tips usually checked out, thrust
the issue into the media spotlight. Sore Throat, like the supposed source
of documents described in the introduction to _In the Public Interest_,
claimed he was a disgruntled AMA staff doctor who was trying to expose
wrongdoing so that organized medicine could proceed with muchneeded
reform.

Bedeviled by leaks, which one AMA spokesman characterized as
"death by one thousand cuts," the AMA was running scared. It hired a
private eye to uncover who was behind the breaches. It purchased paper
shredders to destroy documents. AMA spokesmen engaged in disinformation
about Sore Throat, offering to reveal his true identity. One AMA
spokesman told the press that Sore Throat was "a fruity chiropractor in
Georgetown whose hobby is hairdressing."[^6/37]

The AMA's detective, a former Secret Service agent, quickly traced
the disclosures to a group the AMA had angered years before: the
Church of Scientology. In addition, the AMA investigation found that
Scriptures Unlimited was a small publishing house purchased by the
Church of Scientology just to publish _In the Public Interest_. [^6/38]

Scientology, a religion with a psychological bent founded by sciencefiction
writer L. Ron Hubbard in the 1950s, had a long-simmering
grudge against the AMA. The sect believed the AMA had attempted to
discredit the religion since its earliest days. And church members were
angered by the publication in 1968 in an AMA consumer publication of
an article entitled "Scientology-Menace to Mental Health," in which
Ralph Lee Smith, a special target of derision in the Trever book, described
the wealth gathered by Scientology's leadership and the problems
the group had with the Internal Revenue Service. Smith dismissed
Scientology's tenets as "simple---some say simplistic."[^6/39]

In response, Scientology had issued a "doom program" to destroy
the AMA.[^6/40] A Scientologist, who worked in the AMAs Drug Department,
sometime between 1969 and 1971 had gone through AMA files
and had discovered the mother lode of files on chiropractic, which
formed the basis for _In the Public Interest_. During subsequent operations
in the mid-1970s, papers relating to AMA lobbying efforts and business
practices were uncovered and delivered by Sore Throat to the media,
consumerists, and Congress,[^6/41]

Ironically, only a few months before the leaked AMA documents began
to show up in the press in the summer of 1975, the AMA dismantled
the Department of Investigation and the Committee on Quackery. In
the end, the department had described itself as a success, even though by
the time of its demise Medicare covered chiropractic care to a limited extent
and chiropractic was licensed in all fifty states. The main reason the
AMA cited for closing the office was the AMA's financial woes, which had
led to layoffs of several hundred employees in 1974 and 1975. But although
the Department of Investigation and the Committee on Quackery
technically were dead, they would continue to live on in another
arena---the courts.

## CHIROPRACTIC FIGHTS BACK

U.S. Representative John E. Moss, chairman of the oversight and
investigations subcommittee of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee, was on Sore Throat's mailing list. And the California
Democrat was distressed at what he read. In October 1975 he sent the
Federal Trade Commission copies of AMA documents pertaining to
anti-chiropractic activities. He argued that the AMA efforts to eliminate
chiropractic might constitute a group boycott, which was illegal under
the Sherman Act. Moss pointed out that even though the AMA might
find chiropractic undesirable economically or socially, Congress had included
chiropractic treatments under Medicare coverage. He urged an
investigation.[^6/42]

But in the mid-1970s, the concept of prosecuting professionals, such
as doctors, for antitrust was a new one, and the FTC failed to take on the
case. However, Sore Throat contacted Wilk and other prominent chiropractors,
giving the chiropractors' morale a boost. They decided to explore
the possibility of an antitrust suit, acting under provisions in the
federal law that allowed individuals to act as "private attorneys general."
Wilk and the International Chiropractors Association's Jerome
McAndrews consulted with attorney George P. McAndrews, Jerome's
younger brother.

The younger McAndrews recommended eight Chicago law firms
specializing in antitrust. These attorneys politely but firmly turned away
the chiropractors. The firms felt uncomfortable with the unconventional
chiropractors, and some feared that if they took up the chiropractors'
cause, they might lose business from organized medicine, the many national
medical associations based in Chicago. When the chiropractors informed
him the suit would not be filed unless he represented them,
McAndrews decided to pursue the case himself, obtaining assistance
from Northwestern University antitrust expert Paul Slater. Chester Wilk,
D.C., and three other chiropractors filed suit on October 13, 1976,
against the American Medical Association and a Who's Who of major
medical groups. All told, four AMA officials and eleven of the nation's
most important medical groups were defendants, including the American
Hospital Association, the American College of Surgeons, the American
College of Physicians, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,
the American College of Radiology, and the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Hospitals. Ironically, the American Osteopathic Association
had become so mainstream by that time that it was named as a
defendant.[^6/43]

As he went through his opponents' files during the pretrial discovery
process, McAndrews, who had previously handled only antitrust issues
connected with patents, thought he had a solid case since AMA documents
repeatedly spoke of efforts to "contain and eliminate" chiropractic
and outlined how this was to be accomplished, stating, "We can't let the
public know what we're doing. The AMA's hand must not show." The
Trevor book and Sore Throat had provided the chiropractors with a
smoking cannon.

A vast array of documents critical to the case was available, even
though a top AMA official had advised state societies in 1978 to purge
their files because of a pending federal investigation.[^6/44] In preparing for
the trial from 1977 through 1980, McAndrews visited thirty-four states
and collected over one million documents and 164 depositions. The
AMA couldn't have faced this legal challenge from Wilk, along with three
other chiropractic restraint-of-trade suits, at a worse time because of the
association's precarious financial situation. The AMA was trying to come
back from near-bankruptcy, and its leadership and management knew
the organization was looking at the expenditure of hundreds of thousands,
if not millions, of dollars on its legal defense.

Hoping to make the suits go away, AMA leaders tried to blunt the organization's
stand against chiropractic. The House of Delegates in 1979
adopted a board report, designated as UU, stating that not everything
chiropractors did was without "therapeutic value." Rather than depict all
chiropractors as cultists, the board said "it is better to call attention to the
limitations of chiropractic in treatment of particular diseases." The report,
however, reaffirmed that chiropractic theory was not supported by
science, and the organization continued to stand by a section of its 1957
ethical code, which prohibited medical doctors from associating professionally
with cultists.

Dr. James H. Sammons, the AMA's executive vice president, told delegates:
"To deliberately place ourselves in violation of the antitrust statutes
so that we can go home and self-righteously say that we have done so
is sheer foolishness. It places every doctor in America in greater jeopardy
than he is in already," said Sammons, a pragmatist who was willing to eat
crow if it helped the organization survive. Dr. William S. Hotchkiss, an
AMA Board member who had served on the Committee on Quackery
during its final years, agreed, saying the board report should be supported
as a defensive maneuver to save the AMA money. "If we could
settle it all for a nominal sum, this would not be surrender, but would represent
good common sense," he said.[^6/45] The House of Delegates
adopted report UU by a vast majority.

The AMA effort to rewrite history to head off lawsuits resumed the
next year. In 1980, under the leadership of Dr. James S. Todd, a New
Jersey surgeon and a rising star in AMA circles, the House of Delegates
revised its ethical code, eliminating the section that banned consultation
with unscientific practitioners. Legally, the AMA appeared to have sanitized
the record of its anti-chiropractic stands, but its headaches were far
from over.

The case of _Wilk et al. v. AMA et al._ finally went to trial before U.S.
District Court Judge Nicholas J. Bua in Chicago in December 1980. A
federal appeals court later described the trial as a "free-for-all between
chiropractors and medical doctors, in which the scientific legitimacy of
chiropractic was hotly debated and the comparative avarice of the adversaries
was explored."[^6/46] Bua told jurors they should not find the AMA
guilty of wrongdoing if its actions were merely designed to inform the
public about defects in chiropractic, adding that the AMAs advocacy was
protected if it were aimed at lobbying for changes in law. After an arduous
eight-week trial, the jury concluded the AMA's anti-chiropractic
campaign was within legal bounds.

Afterward, two jurors, in tears, contacted McAndrews and told him
they believed the AMA had done wrong, but based on the judge's instructions,
they felt they had no choice but to let the physicians' group off the
hook. McAndrews filed an appeal, arguing that Bua had erred in his
handling of the case. In 1983 the Appellate Court of the Seventh Federal
District agreed and ordered a new trial.

As the years ground on, AMA's codefendants in growing numbers
settled with the chiropractors, creating ill will in the once-solid brotherhood.
The AMAs battle became increasingly lonely.

U.S. District Court Judge Susan Getzendanner started a nonjury
trial in May 1987. Much of the second trial was a rerun of the first. For
their part, AMA attorneys argued that _if_ there had ever been a boycott of
chiropractic, it had ended in 1980 when the AMA adopted its new ethical
standards. McAndrews countered that increased demand for chiropractic
services and a significant spurt in chiropractors'incomes after liberalization
of the ethical code were proof of the boycott's success earlier. He
said the boycott still lingered because the AMA had never explicitly
spelled out that physicians ethically could consult with chiropractors.

Chiropractic patients told the court how they were helped with
headaches and back pain through spinal manipulation. Wilk described
how his patients had been turned away from hospitals when he sent them
there for X rays. He said he couldn't technically "refer" patients with
medical problems to medical doctors but "transferred" them: "I turn
them over and then I don't see them anymore."[^6/47]

AMA lawyers put on the stand consultants who refuted the evidence
by the chiropractors'experts that attempted to document that chiropractors
were financially disadvantaged because of an AMA boycott. The
AMA questioned the safety of practices used by chiropractors when they
took X rays of patients without shields. Dr. William Jarvis, cofounder of
the National Council Against Health Fraud and a faculty member at
Loma Linda University, criticized chiropractic's underpinnings: "As I see
it, the major problem is a substitution of the chiropractic philosophy for
science."[^6/48] Chiropractors were also attacked for "practice building," procedures
to boost their income by encouraging unnecessary patient visits.
The chiropractors' attorneys were quick to point out that medical doctors,
dentists, psychologists, and other professionals have been accused
of similar methods.

In closing arguments, AMA trial lawyer Douglas R. Carlson said the
AMA acknowledged that chiropractic was becoming more scientific and
even took partial credit for improvements in chiropractic: "We suggest
that one reason that it changed was because of the criticism of its bizarre
methods."[^6/49] The courtroom cracked up when McAndrews, in his closing,
retorted that Carlson's position was akin to a German U-boat captain he
met who took "credit for the American Olympic team being so good because
... by sinking their ships, he taught them how to swim."[^6/50]

### The Conspiracy Unveiled

After a two-month trial, creating a record that included 3,624 pages of
transcript, 1,265 exhibits, and excerpts from seventy-three depositions,
Getzendanner, on August 24, 1987, ruled that the AMA and its officials
"instituted a boycott of chiropractors in the mid-1960s by informing
AMA members that chiropractors were unscientific practitioners and
that it was unethical for a medical physician to associate with chiropractors.
The purpose of the boycott was to contain and eliminate the chiropractic
profession. This conduct constituted a conspiracy among the
AMA and its members and an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation
of Section 1 of the Sherman Act."[^6/51]

Although the number of chiropractic schools, the number of chiropractors,
and the number of visits to chiropractors grew during the
boycott, Getzendanner accepted the Committee on Quackery's acknowledgment
that it had succeeded in containing chiropractic. "These admissions
were not mere puffery," she said. Although the AMA never disciplined
any members for associating with chiropractors, the judge said
the existence of the ethical stricture against such relations "is inherently
a forceful mandator of conduct. ... Enforcement was not necessary to
obtain compliance with the boycott."[^6/52]

Getzendanner shot down the AMA's claims that its anti-chiropractic
policies were ancient history. She indicated that the AMA Board Report
UU stating chiropractic was not entirely unscientific "was obviously written
by lawyers in an effort to bring the AMA into compliance with the
antitrust laws and not a bold change of position designed to reverse the
attitudes of the AMA members formed, at least in part, by the then
11-year-old boycott."[^6/53] The AMA's 1980 revised principles theoretically
allowed AMA members to associate with chiropractors, but there was no
explicit reference to chiropractors in the new code, the judge said. In her
final case before retiring from the bench, Getzendanner said the AMA
had failed to inform its members of the fact that it now recognized improvements
in and benefits from chiropractic.

Getzendanner found the behavior by both the AMA and chiropractic
to be a mixed bag. She said the AMA acted in the blind belief that it
was protecting patient welfare by combating chiropractic. Meanwhile,
she agreed that some therapies used by chiropractors were "alarming"
and potentially harmful to patients. "I do not minimize the negative evidence.
But most of the defense witnesses appeared to be testifying for
the plaintiffs," she said.[^6/54] She stressed that her ruling should not be construed
as an endorsement of chiropractic, nor would she preside over a
shotgun wedding between the professions. "Certainly no judge should
perform that ceremony," she said.[^6/55]

To combat the continuing effects of the conspiracy, she ordered the
AMA to admit the "lawlessness of its past conduct" and to alter its official
policy on chiropractic.[^6/56] As a result, the injunction was published in the
_AMA Journal_ on January 1, 1988, with an editorial by AMA general counsel
Kirk B. Johnson explaining why such an unusual document appeared
in the scientific publication.

The judge also found the American College of Surgeons, the American
College of Radiology, and the American Academy of Orthopaedic
Surgeons guilty of joining the conspiracy; these groups reached out-ofcourt
settlements with the chiropractors. The cases against the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals and the American College of
Physicians were dismissed.

The AMA appealed the case. In February 1990 the Appellate Court
upheld the lower court's ruling, and the U.S. Supreme Court let Getzendanner's
ruling stand in November 1990.[^6/57]

After negotiating for more than a year, the AMA in December 1991
agreed to make a $3.5 million payment for the chiropractors' legal costs
and to publish a new position in its ethical opinions explicitly stating that
medical doctors and chiropractors could associate professionally.[^6/58]

Meanwhile, the old wounds between allopathy and chiropractic and
other alternatives appeared to be healing. Mainstream physicians appeared
to be more open to patients receiving care from nonphysicians.
Several studies on the benefits of chiropractic were published in highly
respected _medical_ journals. In 1992 Congress, pressured by advocates for
alternative medicine, directed the National Institutes of Health, a bastion
of orthodox medicine, to launch a new venture that would not have
been possible in the pre-Wilk era: the NIH Office for Alternative Medicine.[^6/59]
The AMA seemed to be moving on. It converted the voluminous
files from the defunct Department of Investigation, which had hunted
chiropractic, into a research archive in the organization's headquarters.[^6/60]

## PROTECTING THE MONOPOLY

The peacefulspring did not last long. The war against alternative healers
was reignited in the fall of 1993. As in the years before Medicare
was adopted, organized medicine was feeling the strains of change
brought on by the health reforms proposed by the Clinton administration.
Once again the AMA's own forces were divided and demoralized.
They needed an enemy around which they could rally. The AMA took on
a new threat to its control of the health field: nursing.

In _Witches, Midwives, and Nurses: A History of Women Healers_, Barbara
Ehrenreich and Deirdre English note that the male-dominated medical
profession afforded a subservient role to female-dominant nursing.
Nurses were "ancillary," from the Latin for maidservant. Nursing work
was " just low-paid, heavy-duty housework."[^6/61]

They note that modern scientific doctors relied on nurses: "\[He\] was
even less likely than his predecessors to stand around and watch the progress
of his 'cures.' He diagnosed, he prescribed, he moved on. He could
not waste his talents, or his expensive academic training in the tedious
details of bedside care. For this he needed a patient, obedient helper,
someone who was not above the most menial tasks, in short, a nurse."[^6/62]

This role was institutionalized in state nursing-practice acts that in
most cases restrict what nurses can do, preserving the doctors' monopoly.
In effect, nurses in these jurisdictions are limited to providing care delegated
by physicians.[^6/63]

However, a cadre of highly trained specialists---known as advancedpractice
nurses---has in recent years made some gains. In some cases
these nurses are autonomous. They can diagnose and treat disease, prescribe
medications, and receive reimbursement for their services.

The American Nurses Association sees as one of its key missions expanding
the roles of these independent-practice nurses, including
nurse-practitioners, nurse-midwives and nurse-anesthetists. With this in
mind, the ANA increasingly has become politicized, having moved its
headquarters to Washington from Kansas City in 1992. It was the first
major health-care group to endorse the Clinton-Gore ticket.[^6/64] (The
AMA traditionally has not endorsed presidential candidates, concentrating
its efforts on congressional races.)

In the health reform, nursing saw an opportunity to promote autonomy
for nursing. Nursing was encouraged when the Administration said
there was a shortage of primary-care providers---pediatricians, family
physicians, and internists---to provide such care. The ANA charged that
the majority of physicians had abandoned primary care for more lucrative
specialty practices. It said if restrictions on nurses were lifted,
advanced-practice nurses were up to the challenge of providing much of
this basic care. The ANA's slogan became: "In the future your 'family
doctor may be a nurse." Nursing was among the first groups to endorse
the early draft of Clinton's health proposal in September 1993.

Nursing argued that research showed nurses could provide up to
80 percent of care delivered by primary-care physicians, that care given
by nurses was as good or better than physician-provided care, and that
surveys showed the public was open to the idea of nurses furnishing
more of this care. The ANA also contended that nursing care was less
costly than that from physicians. Nurses earned less than doctors,
$45,000 annually for nurse-practitioners vs. $111,800 for family physicians
in 1992.

The Administration partially rewarded nursing in its final reform
package, recommending that state restrictions on nurses be loosened and
that Medicare reimbursement for nurse practitioners be expanded.[^6/65]

A war of words ensued between medicine and its challengers, reminiscent
of some of the battles between the AMA and chiropractic.
Several state medical societies' political action committees warned in
fund-raising letters sent to doctors that some "daffy ducks" were trying
to "fowl up"---one state said "duck up"---medical care by lowering standards
and allowing unqualified people to practice medicine. The nurses
said these physicians were accusing them of being "quacks."

The AMA also went on the attack, questioning whether a shortage of
primary care actually existed. And at the interim meeting in December
1993 in New Orleans, the AMA released a thirty-page report suggesting
that giving nurses more autonomy "may increase the medical risk to patients
and the ultimate cost of care." It opposed giving nurses more autonomy,
including expanding their right to prescribe medicine and to be
reimbursed directly for services. AMA leaders said they favored an expanded
role for nurses so long as they work under the supervision of
physicians. The report concluded: "Nurses in advanced practice are not
educated to independently provide medical care to meet the broad spectrum
of needs of patients in the community."[^6/66] AMA leaders like to say
that "nurses don't know what they don't know," and that nurses "ought to
go to medical school if they want to be doctors."

The economic self-interest of physicians again blurred the AMA's
claims that it was looking out for patients. As ANA president Virginia
Trotter Betts put it, "The issue is control, especially control of dollars.
The AMA wants physician supervision because then the physician gets
the first dollar."

She noted that the AMA "has also opposed autonomy for any practitioner,
whether that be nurse, podiatrist, psychologist, social worker or
chiropractor."[^6/67]

The AMA stands for the status quo, a physician-centered health-care
system. It is unlikely that patients will suffer at the hands of highly
trained nurses. But the AMA will not willingly relinquish the power, prerogatives,
and pay physicians receive under the current medical monopoly.

wish to do all possible harm to the Scientology movement over the world in order to
protect their huge medical-psychiatric income and desired monopoly, which runs into tens
of billions annually" (Rawitch and Gillette, "Church Wages Propaganda on a Wide Scale")

[^6/41]: In 1977 FBI agents, armed with sledgehammers, buzz saws, crowbars, and search warrants,
raided Scientology's Guardian Offices in Washington and Los Angeles. Seeking to recover
stolen government documents, the FBI turned up AMA materials, which AMA
officials tied to Sore Throat. The church leadership admitted that the people implicated in
the AMA invasion were church members, but said they had acted alone without the knowledge
of the church leadership. In addition to AMA material, the FBI found copies of the
tax returns of Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley and singer Frank Sinatra and confidental
material from the FBI and IRS; Interview with B.J. Anderson, special counsel to the AMA;

[^6/43]: Since the 1960s, the once-outcast osteopathic
physicians had become part of the establishment, offering the medical and
surgical services like allopaths as well as manipulation like chiropractic physicians. The
AMA said it was up to each state medical society to set its own policy on osteopathy. In 1989
the AMA gave full recognition to osteopaths as physicians. In 1993 about 5,000 DOs were
AMA members

New Mexico Medical Society, 22 February 1979, 55--66. Marshall said that Whalen
Strobhar, assistant AMA vice president, told the executives that the AMA counsel had recommended
destruction of files because the Federal Trade Commission was subpoenaing
materials related to election and Political Action Committee activities. When asked if he
had destroyed any files from the Committee on Quackery, Marshall said, "If they were in
there, they were purged," 57

Johnson, AMA general counsel, said the ruling would have little impact on the AMA or
doctor-patient relations because the AMA had considered it ethical since 1980 for physicians
to refer patients to "limited practitioners" such as chiropractors
