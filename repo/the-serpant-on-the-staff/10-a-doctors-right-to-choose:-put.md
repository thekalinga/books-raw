# A Doctor's Right to Choose: Putting Physician Choice First in the Abortion Crisis

_NOTE:_ [^8/0]

The American Medical Association
presents a third side to the nation's bitter and divisive abortion
debate. Pro-lifers of course strive to protect the rights of fetuses, considering
each of the 1.6 million abortions performed annually in the United
States to be a murder. Pro-choice advocates seek to protect a woman's
right to choose abortion as a fundamental civil liberty necessary for
women to control their bodies and lives.

The AMA completes the triangle. Like the Roman god Mercury,
holding up his caduceus with the two snakes as a sign of being a noncombatant,
the AMA today claims to be "neutral" on the abortion issue. The
AMA says it uses science to guard the public's health. But the AMA's approach
to abortion seems more based on political expediency and retaining
members than applying scientific research, which indicates that
access to legal abortion reduces death rates for women.

The AMA has had a checkered history on abortion, shifting with the
political winds as it suited the organization's purposes. From the late
1850s until 1900, the AMA placed the abortion debate on the national
agenda, successfully campaigning for criminalization of the procedure.
Historians generally agree that the AMA used the issue as a political tool
to promote legislation to license physicians and undermine mainstream
physicians'economic competitors.

After being silent on abortion for close to a century, in the 1960s and
1970s, the AMA, like many other institutions, grappled with the difficult
medical and moral dilemmas created by abortion. The AMA faced a tension
between those who wanted to liberalize abortion and those who considered
abortion morally and ethically unacceptable. But as availability of
abortion was increased by state legislatures and the courts, the AMA was
forced to remove ethical barriers to physicians who chose to perform
abortions. However, from the early 1980s to the present, as times have
become more conservative, the AMA has insisted repeatedly that it is
"neutral" on abortion. Yet, its policies point to the organization being
pro-choice, or at least for a doctor's right to choose.

## THE AMA's PRO-LIFE CRUSADE

The "regular" medical profession in the mid-nineteenth century, when
the AMA was founded, was buffeted by powerful societal forces. Mainstream---allopathic---medicine
had yet to establish itself as a dominant
social and economic force.

Allopathic practitioners, predecessors of today's scientific doctors,
were threatened by the popularity of "irregular medicine." Irregular
physicians, "wise women," and folk healers offered complete care to their
patients. This included abortions, which allopathic healers pledged
under the ancient ethical oath of Hippocrates not to perform.

The regulars also took note of the nation's dramatically falling birthrates
among "native" Americans, the term for white Anglo-Saxon Protestants
born in this country. They blamed this change in the social order on
abortion, a common and legally accepted practice early in pregnancy.

Also, the first feminist movement had an impact at the time. Women
were becoming more vocal about obtaining rights, such as voting and
owning property, and they were campaigning against prostitution and
slavery. The male establishment, including the male-dominated medical
profession, considered this movement a menace to the status quo. Times
were ripe for a backlash from the regular medical profession.

### The AMA Crusaders

Using a mix of scientific, moral, and other arguments, Dr. Horatio
Robinson Storer, a young Boston obstetrician-gynecologist, in the late
1850s spearheaded what turned into an AMA crusade to oppose abortion.
Storer considered the average American uninformed about scientific
developments regarding the fetus as a living being and unthinking
about destroying fetuses. He contended that the practice was causing a
ruinous slide in societal values. Working through the AMA, Storer
thought doctors could put a stop to it.

At this time the AMA was a new organization, only ten years old,
dedicated to improving medical education and running those it deemed
quacks out of business. The fledgling AMA had yet to test its wings. In
1857 Storer and other pioneering right-to-lifers persuaded the AMA
House of Delegates to appoint a committee to investigate abortion "with
a view to its general suppression."[^8/1]

Storer served as committee chairman. His fellow committee members
were other physicians well-known for their opposition to abortion.
One was Dr. Thomas Blatchford, of New York, who had publicly attacked
the notorious Madame Restell, operator of a large-scale abortion
agency with several branch offices on the Eastern Seaboard. The agency
coyly advertised in newspapers its services to remove "menstrual obstructions."

The antiabortion crusade was the first successful national lobbying
effort run by the AMA. The new organization gave would-be medical
campaigners a platform from which they could achieve goals on a national
scale never before possible for the medical profession. In the years
prior to the Civil War, regular physicians were taking their first steps toward
professionalization, using the AMA as their vehicle to control medical
practice.

Historians have asserted that the battle against abortion aided the
AMA's efforts to destroy the regulars' competition. The regulars deemed
the willingness to perform abortion as a mark of distinction between
themselves and the irregulars and grounds for opposition.

One of the AMA's key points in addressing the abortion issue was attacking
the public's and the law's view of "quickening"---the concept that
a fetus was alive only when the mother could feel it move or kick, an event
that did not occur until the sixteenth to eighteenth week of pregnancy.
Before quickening, induced abortion was generally tolerated and considered
legal in the United States. In light of scientific knowledge of the day,
the AMA Committee on Criminal Abortion thought it scandalous that
the public did not realize fetuses were alive before quickening. By emphasizing
medicine's scientific expertise, doctors were attempting to elevate
their standing as a profession.

The committee at the annual meeting in 1859 criticized common
and statutory law for ignoring the medical evidence for fetal life. Storer
and his colleagues called upon physicians to stop the "slaughter of countless
children" as well as to protect women from dangers at the hands of
abortionists. [^8/2]

Following its committee's recommendations, the House of Delegates
opposed abortion not only after quickening but _throughout_ pregnancy,
except to preserve the life of the mother. The AMA also committed itself
in the name of its "grand and noble calling" to save lives by working
through its state affiliates to lobby for tougher antiabortion laws.[^8/3]

As part of the campaign, the AMA in 1864 announced an essay contest
on abortion. Dr. D. Humphreys Storer, Horatio's father, headed the
judging committee, which announced the results at the AMA's annual
session in 1865. Perhaps not surprisingly, Horatio himself wrote the winning
essay, entitled "The Criminality and Physical Evils of Forced Abortion,"
having entered the tract with his name hidden by a seal, only to be
broken on the convention platform.[^8/4]

The essay sheds light on nineteenth-century medical views of society.
Storer noted that it appeared that family size was shrinking among
the so-called natives. He said this group's family size was deteriorating
drastically, not because of a loss of "procreative abilities" but rather because
the "natives" resorted increasingly to abortion.

Storer fanned xenophobic sentiments, citing a contemporary study
showing the foreign-born who did not practice abortion were giving
birth to more children than were the natives. He contended that not only
did abortion harm mother and child and undermine morals, but it
"strikes a blow at the very foundation of society itself."[^8/5] He said Protestant
natives in an act of self-protection ought to follow the example of
Roman Catholics, among whom abortion was rare.

Storer said "native" women owed it to society to increase their birthrate;
otherwise alien races would populate the Far West and the South.
"This is a question that our own women must answer; upon their loins
depends the future destiny of the nation," he said. [^8/6]

The AMA published an expanded version of Storer's essay as a book,
_Why Not? A Book for Every Woman_, to persuade the general public, especially
women, that abortion was an evil. The book helped harden professional
and public opinion against abortion. Storer followed up with similar antiabortion
books aimed at men in 1867 and for lawyers, legal scholars, and
lawmakers in 1868. Because of his declining health, Storer left the country
in 1872, but regular physicians and their medical societies kept promoting
criminalization of abortion to the public and legislatures.

The AMA Campaign Succeeds

The AMA crusade against abortion gained momentum as doctors successfully
lobbied state by state for criminalization of abortion throughout
pregnancy, not just after quickening. "The pressure of their crusade
pushed state legislators beyond expressions of cautious concern about
abortion and its possible excesses to straightforward opposition to the
practice," according to abortion historian James Mohr, of the University
of Oregon.[^8/7]

The AMA campaign successfully changed the nation's abortion policy
as states and territories passed tough laws. The new laws, often passed
with nativist zeal, made abortion a felony, eliminated the distinction of
quickening to make abortion illegal throughout gestation, and for the
first time set down penalties against the women who had abortions. Between
1857 and the turn of the century, all states, except one, passed laws
to restrict abortion. The single holdout, Kentucky, joined the rest in 1910.

In 1871 the AMA made its final statement on abortion in the nineteenth
century; it would be its last major statement on the issue for
nearly 100 years. The Committee on Criminal Abortion condemned
physicians who continued to perform abortions, holding that the doctor's
role was to be the protector not the destroyer of life and the advocate for
God and not Satanic forces. The committee called for professional selfregulation
and purification to remove abortionists, whom it referred to
as "executioners" and "paid assassins."[^8/8] The crusaders said doctors
should take matters into their own hands and organize "a special police
to watch, and to detect and to bring to justice these characters \[abortionists\]."[^8/9]

In the view of the AMA, which was male-controlled by definition because
women were excluded for the most part from allopathic medical
schools, women essentially were breeders, who by aborting fetuses ignored
their destiny to reproduce. In 1871 the Committee on Criminal
Abortion said a woman who aborts "yields to the pleasures but shirks
from the pains and responsibilities of maternity. ... Let not the husband
flatter himself that he possesses her affection. Nor can she in turn
even merit the respect of a virtuous husband. She sinks into old age like a
withered tree, stripped of its foliage; with the stain of blood upon her
soul, she dies without the hand of affection to smooth her pillow."[^8/10]

Ironically, the feminist movement of the time supported the AMA's
antiabortion campaign. Feminist reformers fought abortion for their
own reasons. They wanted to halt such abuses as women being forced
against their wills to undergo abortion, and they also sought ways to
make men responsible for their sexual indulgences.

Based on the report, the House of Delegates again denounced abortionists.
However, delegates said a physician could perform an abortion if
at least one other medical consultant agreed it was medically necessary,
"and then always with a view to the safety of the child---if that be possible."[^8/11]
The medical profession was looking out for the fetus, the pregnant
woman, and society at large, but it also was defending its own interests.
[^8/12]

According to Mohr, as the AMA and regular physicians gained control
of medicine in the United States by the end of the nineteenth century,
they no longer needed to press for abortion laws as a means of
attacking the irregulars. He said, "By 1900 abortion no longer seemed to
be a threat to the native population, and regular physicians had already
successfully accomplished most of their personal and professional
goals."[^8/13]

The AMA provided a base from which Storer and like-minded colleagues
helped shape public opinion and policy to criminalize abortion.
AMA-inspired legislation remained on the books well into this century.
However, these laws were not totally effective, and abortion continued to
be performed underground, with sometimes disastrous results. [^8/14]

## REFORMING ANTIABORTION LAWS

After its 1871 report on abortion, the AMA did not concern itself with
the matter again until the 1960s. The medical profession and the public
were by that time being increasingly sensitized to the abortion issue.
Many physicians already were well acquainted with the pain and hardship
women endured to obtain illegal abortions and the doctors' difficulties
in caring for women who arrived in emergency rooms dying from
septic shock.

Then, there was the highly publicized case of a woman who wanted
to abort a fetus she feared had been damaged by a tranquilizer. America
in 1962 was caught up in the travail of Sherri Finkbine, a children's television
personality from Phoenix. Early in her pregnancy, Finkbine, twentynine,
the mother of four, had taken thalidomide. She soon learned the
medication had caused grotesque limb damage in some European children.
Although the Food and Drug Administration had not approved
the drug, some Americans, such as Finkbine's husband, had brought it
back from Europe. Fearing the worst, and on the advice of her doctor,
Finkbine scheduled a "therapeutic abortion" in a Phoenix hospital. Since
the time of the AMA antiabortion crusade, abortion could be performed
legally only for _therapeutic_ reasons. In such cases a fetus was aborted to
save the life of the mother. But many desperate pregnant women used
any ruse they could to try to qualify for a therapeutic abortion.

Finkbine told her story anonymously to a local newspaper in hopes
of warning other women about the drug's side effects. When the article
came out, the hospital canceled the operation, and Finkbine's efforts to
abort the fetus became national news. She finally obtained an abortion in
Sweden, where a pathologist confirmed the fetus had been a "monster."

The Finkbine case was dramatic, though thalidomide was not a
large-scale threat in this country. The case however was a lightning rod
for a public debate on abortion.

In the early and mid-1960s, the discussion about abortion was further
energized by widespread concerns about fetal damage from the epidemics
of German measles-rubella. Women whose fetuses might have
been deformed by rubella did not meet the requirements for therapeutic
abortion because the virus did not cause serious health problems to the
mother. Still, rubella could wreak havoc during early development. An
infected fetus faced the potential for deformed limbs, brain damage,
blindness, deafness, and other problems. Frightened about possible side
effects, many women received a sympathetic hearing from doctors and
hospital abortion committees. The hospital committees had been established
in the 1950s to prevent hospitals from being used to perform abortions
for nontherapeutic reasons.

By the late 1960s, abortion was permissible only in forty-five states to
preserve or save the _life_ of the mother; whereas the mother's _health_ generally
was not supposed to be a consideration. But that was not the reality of
abortion in the mid-1960s. At that time, about 10,000 abortions a year
were being performed in American hospitals, few of them to preserve or
save the mother's life. They commonly were performed for "fetal indications,"
such as the fetus having possible damage from rubella.

Only five states and the District of Columbia permitted abortion to
preserve _the health_ of the mother. And doctors approved up to one half of
abortions because the pregnancy posed a threat to the mother's _mental
health_. [^8/15] The claim was made in such cases that women were threatening
to kill themselves unless they had an abortion.

The Finkbine case and the rubella outbreaks softened both the attitude
of the public and doctors concerning therapeutic abortion. Couples
seeking abortions were shocked when they experienced the humiliating
ordeal of obtaining a legal therapeutic abortion. Physicians, lawyers, and
other policy leaders began to think seriously about reforming, even repealing,
the nearly century-old state laws passed in response to the AMA
crusade.

### The AMA Revisits Abortion

With the growing confusion about what to do about abortion, the conservative
AMA Board of Trustees decided in 1965 to revisit the issue. It
appointed a Committee on Human Reproduction, chaired by a prominent
Roman Catholic obstetrician/gynecologist, to investigate abortion.
The committee presented proposed guidelines on abortion to the AMA
annual assembly in 1965. The policy was primarily based on model legislation
recommended in 1962 by the American Law Institute, a group of
judges, lawyers, and legal scholars that periodically proposes legal reforms.
The AMA committee said legislation should be passed to allow
physicians to perform an abortion only under certain circumstances:
when it could be established that continuing the pregnancy would
"gravely impair" the mother's physical or mental health; when there was
a "substantial risk" that the child would be born with a "grave physical or
mental defect"; and when it was legally established that the pregnancy
resulted from statutory or forcible rape or incest. The committee also
urged that abortion be performed only in hospitals and that two physicians
other than the doctor performing the abortion support in writing
the need for the operation.

The committee's recommendations went beyond existing legislation,
and would have placed the AMA in the position of recommending
changes in state laws. Many delegates did not want the organization to be
a leader on such a controversial and divisive issue. As a result, the AMA
reference committee, which heard discussion on the report, concluded
that the AMA ought to defer to the individual states and their local medical
societies. The House of Delegates was left to sort out conflicting religious,
ethical, and legal questions. In the end, delegates ducked the
controversy and referred the report back to the Board of Trustees to further
explore the issues with the American Bar Association and other
groups.

As the AMA mulled over the issues the next few years, the states began
reforming their laws. Colorado led the way with passage of the first
modern abortion law, basing it on the American Law Institute blueprint.
In April 1967 Republican governor John Love signed a bill allowing
abortions in hospitals for women who were at risk of permanent mental
or physical damage from their pregnancies or who had been impregnated
through rape or incest. The next month, North Carolina passed an
ALI-type law.

Then, Republican California governor Ronald Reagan in June 1967
signed a liberalized law, supported by the AMA's California affiliate, permitting
abortion when the mother's health was at risk and when the pregnancy
was the result of rape or incest. The future pro-life President,
however, persuaded legislators to remove a provision that allowed an
abortion to be performed when the fetus was deformed. [^8/16]

The AMA Board's Committee on Human Reproduction presented
delegates with a new approach in June 1967. The committee skirted
problems it encountered on its first outing two years earlier. This time it
did not recommend that state laws be changed. Rather, it urged that the
AMA merely adopt a liberalized position on therapeutic abortion to
serve as a guide to its affiliates in states contemplating reform. The
House adopted the policy, the first change since 1871. It put the AMA on
record as allowing _abortion_ in cases when there was documented medical
evidence that continuance of pregnancy threatened "the health or life of
the mother," or when the infant may be born with "incapacitating physical
deformity or mental deficiency," or when a pregnancy from a legally
established rape or incest represented a threat to the woman's mental or
physical health. The guideline also urged that two physicians endorse
the appropriateness of the procedure and that the abortion be performed
in a hospital. [^8/17]

The committee acknowledged Roman Catholic opposition to all
abortion, even to save the mother's life. "The Committee respects the
right of this group to express and practice its belief. However, the Committee
believes that physicians who hold other views should be legally
able to exercise sound medical judgment which they and their colleagues
feel to be in the best interest of the patient," the report said. [^8/18]

During the floor debate, a single delegate spoke out "to prevent the
record from showing unanimous approval." The AMA position would
not prove acceptable to many Roman Catholic physicians or others with
right-to-life views still attuned to the views of the nineteenth-century
AMA antiabortion crusaders. [^8/19]

## THE ETHICAL DILEMMA

The AMA had been trying hard not to make radical changes in its policies,
but events in 1970 were about to overtake it. A handful of states
began repealing, not just reforming, their abortion laws. This meant physicians
in these states were free to perform elective or nontherapeutic
abortions, procedures the AMA considered unethical. A reluctant AMA
was being pushed to make some new policy decisions.

Hawaii became the first state to eliminate criminal penalties for
abortion as opposed to reformulating its statutes according to the American
Law Institute model statutes. In Hawaii abortion could take place before
the twenty-fourth week of pregnancy, after which the fetus was
considered "viable" or able to live outside the womb with medical support.
Hawaii also eliminated hospital abortion committees, though it still
required the procedure to be performed in a hospital. Hawaii's Democratic
governor John A. Burns, who attended mass daily and once had
been named Roman Catholic layman of the year, let the bill become law
without signing it in March, because he considered illegal abortion dangerous
and also because he believed legal silence on abortion was faithful
to separation of church and state. In April 1970 the New York legislature,
by a single vote switched at the last minute, repealed its abortion law, leaving
abortion a matter between a woman and her physician through the
twenty-fourth week of pregnancy. Developments in populous New York
were too big for the AMA leadership to ignore.

Just before the annual meeting in June 1970, the board announced
in the AMA newspaper its proposals to liberalize policies beyond the
stands taken on therapeutic abortion in 1967. Sympathetic to the plight
of the physicians in New York and other states where the laws had been
repealed, the board said: "Many physicians find themselves unable to
perform a legalized medical procedure without violating the policy of
their professional association."[^8/20]

On short notice, pro-life doctors in Boston scrambled to protest
the proposed stand. Dr. Joseph R. Stanton, an internist at St. Elizabeth
Hospital, on whose staff Horatio Storer had served a century earlier,
gathered 950 signatures on a petition opposing a policy change he considered
to support abortion on demand. In his petition submitted at the
meeting, Stanton warned: "European and Japanese experience clearly
indicates that the people of this country will be ill-served and our profession
irreparably damaged if medicine's time-honored position of profound
respect for and protection of human life from its inception to
natural death is altered in any way."

The reference committee held its hearing in June 1970 before a
packed room, where the testimony often was bitter. Dr. Gloria Heffernan,
of suburban Chicago, the only woman to testify against the board's
proposal, said, "The killing of the living inside the womb will open the
way to the execution of the living outside the womb."[^8/21]

But Dr. Allan C. Barnes, obstetrics chairman at Johns Hopkins, observed
that abortion helped treat "teenage illegitimacy ... one of our
worst diseases." Dr. Josephine Renshaw, president of the American Medical
Women's Association and a Washington obstetrician, said, "Over and
over again, I have seen boyfriends and husbands walking away from unwanted
pregnancies, but women can't walk away."[^8/22]

Behind the scenes, the AMA leadership was lining up the support it
needed to adopt a liberalized stand. Before the House of Delegates
voted, the AMA's Judicial Council, which sets the organization's ethical
standards, held abortion was ethical when performed legally and "in accordance
with good medical practice." This statement rubbed salt into
the wounds of the pro-life physicians, who argued that doctors themselves,
not lawmakers, ought to determine professional ethics.

But by a 103--73 vote, the House of Delegates approved the new policy.
The AMA was now on record as recognizing abortion as a "medical
procedure" that should be performed by a physician "in conformance
with standards of good medical practice" in a hospital after consulting
with two other physicians. The policy also added a conscience clause saying
no doctors, hospitals, or other medical personnel should be forced to
participate in abortion if they were morally opposed to the practice. Dr.
Wendell Scott, chairman of the reference committee, said the new guidelines
moved abortion beyond being limited to cases where it was medically
indicated. He argued that the phrase "good medical practice"
permitted abortion to be performed for social and economic considerations,
such as teen pregnancies or a family's ability to afford another
child. [^8/23]

The AMA held another hearing on abortion at its winter session in
1970. Stanton and others protested the policy change. "We had an incredible
number of doctors speak at those hearings. But it was a stacked
meeting. The AMA wrote us off," said Stanton, head of the Value for Life
Committee, a pro-life group chartered in October 1970. "Medicine had
lost its soul."'[^8/24]

The abortion policies took a toll on AMA membership, resulting in a
significant number of doctors quitting the organization. For the previous
ten years, the number of AMA members had been rising, but after the
abortion policy was set, a precipitous slide in membership occurred.
Though it is not possible to know how many left over this issue, some
20,000 physicians, about 9 percent of members, left the AMA between
1970 and 1972.[^8/25]

## THE SUPREME COURT UPS THE STAKES WITH _ROE V. WADE_

The abortion debate intensified in the early 1970s. Reform and repeal
efforts, boosted by a growing women's movement calling on women to
control their own bodies, continued at the state level, with many states
liberalizing their statutes along ALI lines or repealing them. New devices
made abortion safer for women undergoing the procedure. At the same
time, the pro-life movement had some success, having under the leadership
of Dr. J. C. Willke, founder of the National Right to Life Committee,
defeated referenda in Michigan and North Dakota to create abortion on
demand through the twentieth week of pregnancy.

Then, on January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court changed everything.
In a sweeping 7-to-2 decision, the Court declared unconstitutional
all existing state abortion laws, ruling simultaneously on a Texas case, _Roe
v. Wade_, and a Georgia case, _Doe v. Bolton_. In one wide-ranging decision,
the Court made abortion on demand the law of the land for the first trimester
and made it available with possible restrictions in the second and
third trimesters, threw out requirements for supporting physician opinions,
got rid of hospital abortion committees, and even abandoned the
requirement that abortions be performed in hospitals. Physicians were
given a certified right to perform abortions based on medical judgment
that could take into account a broad definition of the woman's well-being,
including shaky marital status and indigence. "This allows the attending
physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment," said
Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the decision's author. [^8/26]

"Jane Roe," an unmarried twenty-five-year-old pregnant woman
from Dallas County, was denied an abortion under an 1857 Texas criminal
abortion statute that permitted abortion only to save a woman's life.
Roe's life was not endangered, but she contended she ought to be allowed
to have an abortion. She claimed she had been impregnated in a gang
rape, though years later she recanted the story.

The Supreme Court found Roe had the right to an abortion, under
privacy protections provided by the due-process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.[^8/27] Blackmun wrote that "the right of personal privacy
includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified
and must be considered against important state interests in regulation."[^8/28]

Blackmun, former general counsel at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota, presented a trimester scheme for pregnancy. During the first
trimester, or about thirteen weeks' gestation, a woman---with a doctor's
consent---could have an abortion without government interference. As
pregnancy progressed, the state had increasing rights to intervene---to
protect maternal health during the second trimester and even to proscribe
abortion during the third trimester unless the life or health of the
pregnant woman were at risk. Blackmun made the personal physician
the prime authority in the abortion decision. He stated: "The decision
vindicates the right of the physician to administer medical treatment
according to his professional judgment up to the points where important
state interests provide compelling justifications for intervention. Up to
those points the abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently, and
primarily, a medical decision, and basic responsibility for it must rest with
the physician."[^8/29] The Court's majority felt Doctor knew best.

In dissent, Justice William H. Rehnquist said the majority decision to
recognize trimesters and to define state restrictions during each period
"partakes more of judicial legislation than it does of determination of
the intent of the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment."[^8/30]

Blackmun presented a broad historic perspective, tracing thought
on abortion from ancient times to colonial America to his own time. Prolifers
later would criticize him for relying heavily on a history prepared
by an attorney for the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion
Laws.

In the majority decision, Blackmun said the Hippocratic oath's
disapproval of abortion was unusual in the ancient world. Hippocrates,
the ancient Greek physician whose oath long served as the basis of medical
ethics, belonged to the minority pro-life Pythagorean school. In contrast,
the heavyweight ancient Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle
were pro-choice. Blackmun contended abortion, particularly before
quickening, was tolerated in America in colonial times under the common
law brought from England. The laws criminalizing abortion, passed
under the guidance of the AMA in the nineteenth century, were a historic
quirk, according to the official Supreme Court version. "It is thus
apparent that at common law, at the time of the adoption of our Constitution,
and throughout the vast portion of the 19th century, abortion
was viewed with less disfavor than under most American statutes currently
in effect," Blackmun ruled.[^8/31] The decision also took note of the
recent liberalization of AMA abortion policy.

In the companion case, _Doe v. Bolton_, the Court struck down provisions
of an ALI-type law adopted by Georgia in 1968. The case involved
"Mary Doe," a married woman, an indigent with a history of
mental illness. Doe was denied an abortion at eight weeks' gestation because
her desire to abort a child she and her husband could not support
failed to meet the statute's criteria. The Court said the Georgia law's requirement
that abortions be performed in hospitals violated constitutional
due-process provisions. Blackmun said Georgia had failed to
prove abortions were any safer in a hospital setting than anywhere else.
This decision cleared the way for the creation of a new workplace for
physicians: the abortion clinic.

The Court also made it possible for women to obtain abortions on
the say-so of their personal physicians alone, removing the Georgia requirement
that two other doctors pass on the recommendation. The
Court said that a required approval of two physicians other than the
woman's had "no rational connection with a patient's needs and unduly
infringes on her physician's right to practice."[^8/32] Further, the Court
knocked down the Georgia mandate that a hospital committee, consisting
of three staff physicians, rule on a woman's abortion request. It said
the committees were "unduly restrictive of the patient's rights, which are
already safeguarded by her personal physician."

The Court's abortion decision strongly upheld a physician's right to
practice. This fed the AMA's traditional position of fiercely promoting
and protecting the autonomy of physicians to treat their patients without
state interference. In dissent, Justice Byron R. White, joined by Rehnquist,
described the decision as "an exercise of raw judicial power."[^8/33]

## LINING UP WITH ROE AND DOE

At its June 1973 meeting in New York City, the AMA made its abortion
policy consistent with _Roe_ and _Doe_. The House of Delegates "reaffirmed"
its 1970 policy but removed requirements that abortions be performed
in "accredited hospitals" and that consultations be made with two other
physicians. In an effort to placate pro-life physicians, the reference committee
suggested that the House adopt a statement affirming "the traditional
favorable attitude of the medical profession toward pregnancy
and motherhood." Dr. Joseph Donnelly, an abortion opponent, felt this
was hypocritical and angrily moved that the clause not be added: "There
were more abortions in this city in the past year than live births," the New
Jersey obstetrician said. "We can no longer say that the traditional attitude
of the medical profession is in favor of pregnancy and motherhood.
It doesn't tell it like it is."[^8/34] Delegates noisily overruled Donnelly and
adopted the resolution.

## DOCTOR'S CHOICE, Not PRO-CHOICE

Following the 1973 Supreme Court decision, however, the right-to-life
movement grew more sophisticated and began chipping away at abortion
rights. Pro-lifers succeeded in lobbying in state and municipal governments
for laws that made access to abortion more difficult. [^8/35]

At the federal level they were also able to pull off a coup with a ban
on the use of federal funds to pay for abortion for the poor under the
state-federal Medicaid program. The ban began in September 1976,
when Representative Henry J. Hyde, a freshman Republican from suburban
Chicago, cut off federal funding of abortion through Medicaid
with an amendment tacked on to the Department of Labor Appropriations
Bill. Jittery about the increasingly high visibility of the abortion issue
and calculating the courts would throw out the amendment, the
Senate adopted the Hyde amendment, but it added the proviso that
funding would be available should the life of the mother be endangered.
As expected, a federal judge in New York blocked implementation of the
law until its legality could be determined.

While still awaiting a court decision on the original Hyde amendment,
the House of Representatives and the Senate in 1977 engaged in
one of the most bitter internecine battles in history as they fought over
abortion restrictions for fiscal 1978 relating to the budgets for the Departments
of Labor and Health, Education and Welfare.

Senator Edward W. Brooke, a Massachusetts Republican, organized
a campaign in July 1977 to line up votes to support federal funding
of abortion. He cast the issue as being one in which the doctor in consultation
with his or her patient---not the government---should decide
whether an abortion should be performed. As part of this effort, he approached
the AMA, and the doctors' group, always a booster for physician
autonomy, was more than happy to help. Dr. James H. Sammons,
AMA executive vice president, told Brooke in a telegram that the AMA
believed the government should stay out of the doctor-patient relationship:
"An abortion is a medical procedure and as such can only properly
be performed by a licensed physician. The performance of an abortion is
a matter of determination by both the patient and the physician, and the
procedure should be performed consistently with applicable law and
good medical practice." He said Congress should not "substitute its judgment
for that of the trained physician" by specifying medical conditions
that made abortion a "medical necessity."[^8/36] Brooke used Sammons' telegram
as a sales tool to try to win Senate votes.

When pro-lifers obtained a copy of the Sammons wire, they rebuked
the AMA leadership. But Sammons told one writer the AMA was standing
its ground in opposition to Congress defining when a medical procedure
was necessary: "I cannot help but believe that the Association's
position on this point would, in fact, represent the views of a majority of
all practicing physicians."[^8/37] Dr. Joseph Stanton, president of the Value of
Life Committee, responded that the AMA surely recognized that the
government was already heavily involved in medicine, such as having
third parties decide whether patients should be hospitalized under Medicare.

### Fetal Life

In August 1978 a federal judge lifted his block of the first Hyde amendment,
rejecting pro-choice lawyers' arguments that the law was "unconstitutionally
vague." The running battle over federal funding for
abortion resumed. By the early 1980s, the right-to-life movement shifted
its attention to the Senate, where Republicans sensitive to their views had
a majority. Conservative North Carolina senator Jesse Helms, a pro-life
angel, had in the mid-1970s failed in his efforts to push a constitutional
amendment that would recognize the unborn's right to life. But in 1981
he came up with a new angle. He planned to push an easier-to-pass statute
to nullify _Roe v. Wade_. Helms introduced the Human Life Statute,
which defined a fetus as a "person" from the moment of conception, an
idea advocated by Dr. Horatio Storer in 1865.[^8/38] In the modern twist,
Helms theorized that if a fetus were extended status as a person, the
1973 Supreme Court Roe decision effectively would be negated.

Recognizing potential dangers to patient care, the AMA was in the
forefront of the opposition to the bill. In June 1981, Dr. Joseph F. Boyle,
chairman of the Board of Trustees, who had contemplated becoming a
priest before choosing medicine, told the Senate Judiciary Committee's
Subcommittee on Separation of Powers that the Helms bill incorrectly
assumed there was a "scientific consensus" supporting the position that
life begins at conception. If the Helms bill passed, Boyle warned, it would
damage physician-patient relations by "creat\[ing\] endless medical, ethical,
and legal difficulties for the people of this nation. A physician could
face serious dilemmas in advising pregnant patients. Under the bill, the
physician would be responsible for the welfare of every fetus whose legal
and health interest would in the eyes of the law, be equal to, but in conflict
with, those of the woman."[^8/39]

With AMA assistance, the bill failed before the full Judiciary Committee.
But soon, as conservative winds blew stronger, the AMA for the
most part would avoid abortion issues except when vital to protect physician
interests.

## STAYING ON THE GOOD SIDE OF CONSERVATIVES

With the arrival in Washington in the 1980s of the Reagan/Bush administration,
its conservative agenda, including pro-life positions, became
more fashionable. Trying to remain on the good side of the White House
and its congressional friends, the AMA became less visible on abortion
and other issues that might offend conservative sensibilities. AMA chief
executive Dr. James Sammons in 1982 went so far as to tell the editor of
the _AMA Journal_ to have his staff go easy on articles on particularly sensitive
issues, including abortion, nuclear war, and tobacco.

However, the AMA still stood up for physician rights as it filed
amicus---friend of the court---briefs, a position presented by a party not
directly involved in a lawsuit, in several major abortion-related cases before
the Court. But pro-choice advocates detected a weakening of the
AMA's resolve, especially in lobbying on abortion issues. The AMA
wanted to avoid the issue because of persisting memories of membership
hemorrhage and because it considered other matters to have a
higher priority in Congress.

A case in point involved the controversial "gag" rule, an order promulgated
by Reagan's Department of Health and Human Services in
1988 that prohibited abortion from being mentioned as a birth-control
option to patients in federally funded family-planning centers. Prochoice
advocates expected the AMA to immediately bring out its big guns
in the courts and in Congress to oppose this affront to physician autonomy.
But the AMA faltered.

Ann Allen, general counsel for the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists, said the AMA joined forces only hesitantly in an
amicus brief in the _Rust v. Sullivan_ case, an unsuccessful challenge of the
legality and constitutionality of the gag rule. And within the brief, the
AMA selectively opposed the gag rule on statutory grounds, standing
apart from ACOG and other medical organizations' broader opposition
to the gag rule on constitutional grounds, such as violation of freespeech
guarantees.[^8/40] The Supreme Court upheld the gag rule in 1990,
leading abortion-rights and medical groups to begin lobbying for laws to
nullify the regulations. After the AMA belatedly signed on, President
Bush announced that physicians were not barred from counseling patients
about abortion, though the gag still applied to other health
workers who actually did most of the counseling. Many pro-choice advocates
remain angry and distrustful of the AMA.

Kirk B. Johnson, AMA general counsel, insists the AMA has showed
courage and leadership in filing briefs in abortion cases. He explained
the AMA philosophy: "On the issue of whether or not a woman has a
fundamental right to privacy and a right to obtain medical treatment, we
are not neutral. We are as pro ... I wouldn't say pro-choice ... but as
pro-right-to-privacy as you can get. And we've always felt strongly about
that. It really goes to the very heart of the physician-patient relationship;
the right of people to select their physicians and obtain medical judgments
and legal medical procedures. And as long as abortion is a legal
procedure you have to be entitled to exercise your right and you cannot
be impeded."[^8/41]

In the case of abortion, as in so many other issues, the AMA is playing
politics rather than trying to do what is right or just. Rachael Pine, of
the New York---based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy and formerly
an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive
Freedom Project, questioned the AMA's commitment. "They have
the right views, but politics really intervenes about when and where
they'll express them," she said. "If they really want to be neutral, they
would stay out of it."[^8/42]

## ABORTION-POLICY SHIFT?

AMA delegates attending the winter 1989 meeting in Honolulu, for the
most part were caught up in a financial scandal involving some of the
organization's top staffers. But they still found time to dabble in the abortion
debate.

The California delegation introduced a resolution calling on the
AMA to acknowledge a woman's right to an "early" abortion. The policy
stated that "early termination of pregnancy is a medical matter between
the patient and physician, subject to the physician's clinical judgment, the
patients informed consent, and the availability of appropriate facilities."
During a hearing, Dr. James E. Davis, immediate past president of the
AMA, urged delegates to back off. "This is apt to open up a lot of fruitless
debate," he said. "The board does not think this issue needs to be reaired."

Dr. Charles W. Plows, chairman of the California delegation, however,
said the policy change recommended by his delegation would be a
"warm and substantive" change from the AMA's "terribly cold and didactic"
position on abortion, which did not directly recognize a woman's
right to abortion. Plows was especially angered that disadvantaged
women had difficulty obtaining abortion: "That rich women can get
abortions and poor women can't is a lot of ca-ca."

Representing pro-life forces within the AMA, Dr. Edward G. Kilroy
urged delegates not to "radically" change AMA policy. And another delegate
insisted the "appropriate position is no position." Still, the California
resolution was adopted. In the end, there was confusion about what
transpired. Pro-lifers and pro-choicers said the policy had changed, but
the AMA Board disagreed. AMA trustee Dr. Nancy W. Dickey said the
new policy was merely a "reaffirmation" of existing policy.[^8/43]

## "NEUTRALITY" IN THE WAR ZONE

The AMA's policies in the 1990s on abortion send such mixed signals
that the association angers people on both sides of the debate. Events occurring
over a matter of days in the summer of 1992 highlight how the
AMA's "neutrality" has resulted in its being attacked by both sides.

Abortion came up at the annual meeting in June 1992 in connection
with a campaign to promote the health of teens. Delegates were discussing
a policy that for the first time explicitly stated that physicians ought to
be able to perform an abortion on an unmarried minor _without notifying
her parents_. "This is new ground," explained AMA general counsel Kirk
Johnson. "The old way was always to ask the parents."[^8/44]

Still, the proposed position was actually an extension of an AMA policy
in the 1960s that held doctors should be able to treat teens infected
with venereal disease without parental notification. To protect the health
of youths, the AMA felt it sometimes is necessary to sidestep the youngsters'
parents because they otherwise might refuse needed medical care.

Despite this precedent, performing an abortion before notifying a
minor's parent or obtaining parental permission remained a touchy matter.
Surveys showed the vast majority of the public wanted parents
involved when their minor daughters were scheduled to undergo abortions.
Right-to-life groups saw the issue as a political wedge to put between
the general public and the pro-choice movement. More than half
the states had laws on the books requiring parental involvement or notification
in abortion decisions by minors, though most of these laws were
not enforced. Nevertheless, the issue was of more than symbolic significance
because 11 percent of all abortions are performed on girls
seventeen and under.

The AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, which recommended
the new policy regarding parental notification, said doctors
ought to encourage minors to discuss their pregnancies with their parents
or with a counselor or clergyman. The report said, however, if a
pregnant teen did not want her parents involved, "Physicians should not
feel or be compelled to require minors to obtain consent before deciding
whether to undergo an abortion."

The contemporary AMA position on parental notification---as well
as on abortion in general---relates to the AMA view of doctor-patient relations.
The AMA above all else is an advocate of physician autonomy
and works hard to keep anyone else out of the examining room. The
AMA's objective in today's abortion controversy has been to protect a doctor's
right to perform abortion, with a mind toward protecting his or her
right to perform other procedures. Acknowledging state parentalnotification
requirements, the AMA said its policy applied only when it
did not contradict local laws. The AMA was not going far out on a limb.

### Attacked from Both Sides

As some delegates were cautioning the AMA hearing that the proposal
could widen breaches among doctors, pickets marched outside the meeting
headquarters. Members of the Pro-Life Action League carried mock
tombstones with the names of 113 women who had died from legal abortions.[^8/45]
Protest leader Joseph M. Scheidler, director of the league and
author of _Closed: 99 Ways to Stop Abortion_, said at the time that the AMA's
policy intruded on the parent-child relationship by placing an exaggerated
priority on the doctor-patient relationship. "My daughter cannot
have her ears pierced without my permission," he said. "Now the AMA is
saying that they want doctors to be able to take a girl in for major surgery
without parental knowledge and consent."[^8/46] The next day, June 23, the
AMA House of Delegates adopted, without debate, the new policy in a
victory, albeit a minor one, for pro-choice advocates [^8/47]

Then, only eight days after the AMA adopted this position, on July 1,
1992, a group convened by the National Abortion Rights Action League
(NARAL), for other reasons, also condemned the AMA. Their beef was
that the AMA was not aggressively supporting abortion rights at a time
when the U.S. Supreme Court was expected to take away those rights by
reversing its landmark 1973 decision, _Roe v. Wade_. The NARAL Commission
on America Without _Roe_ feared that women's lives would be endangered
because they would be forced to seek illegal abortions. The group
said organized medicine, especially the AMA, had abdicated its responsibility
to ensure that women have access to the full spectrum of
reproductive-health services.

The NARAL commission was incensed that the AMA had failed to
file an amicus brief in _Planned Parenthood v. Casey_, the case expected to be
the vehicle the Court would use to overturn _Roe_. In this suit, Planned Parenthood
challenged a Pennsylvania law that required doctors to recite a
script that pro-choice groups held was aimed at discouraging women
from having abortions. The NARAL commission charged: "The AMA's
failure to take a position in this critically important case reveals a serious
lack of commitment to women's reproductive rights."[^8/48]

The AMA's concept of neutrality is foreign to both pro-life and prochoice
advocates. AMA chief executive Dr. James S. Todd took it philosophically:
"The pro-lifers pick on us, but so do the pro-choice people.
We're being attacked from both sides. That puts us in a neutral position,
doesn't it? We can't win no matter what we do. And on this subject I think
the less the AMA says \[the better\]."[^8/49]

## PUBLIC HEALTH VS. POLITICS

By turning abortion into a national issue for its own purposes almost 150
years ago, the AMA set off a series of events that helped create one of the
thorniest controversies of our time. Perhaps now it could help lead us out
of this maze.

In recent years the AMA has waved the flag of neutrality on the issue.
But it ought to start acting like a group of doctors concerned about
its patients instead of like medical politicians. The AMA likes to say that it
sets its policy based on science. It also likes to say that it promotes the
"betterment" of public health.

That being the case, if the AMA is willing to assume a leadership
role, its own policies already contain the seeds to help make access to
abortion a matter of good medical-patient care. The AMA of course has
submitted, albeit somewhat reluctantly at times, amicus briefs on the prochoice
side in the courts. It also has advocated positions totally unacceptable
to pro-life forces, such as research on and, if justified, use of the
"abortion pill," RU-486, and also research on transplantation of fetal
tissue.

But more fundamental than these is an AMA report, adopted in
1992, that received little notice except among pro-life critics. In its report,
the Council on Scientific Affairs, the AMA's science arm, showed
that since the Supreme Court ruled in the _Roe_ case in 1973, abortionrelated
death rates had dropped more than fivefold. In fact, the report
stated that the risk of dying from childbirth and pregnancy was twelve
times greater than that of dying from an induced abortion. Quite a contrast
from crusader Dr. Horatio Storer's cla ms in 1865 that more women
died from abortion than from childbirth.[^8/50]

The 1992 report went on to say that restrictive abortion regulations,
such as mandatory waiting periods and the shortage of abortion doctors,
were dangerous because they increased the gestational age at which
abortion occurs. The council concluded that further restrictions on
women's access to abortion could lead to "a small but measurable increase
in mortality and morbidity among women in the United States."[^8/51]

This means that loss of abortion rights poses a public health threat.
If the AMA is serious about safeguarding the public health, it ought to
try to protect the health of American women. It could promote training
of more doctors to provide what most Americans consider an essential
medical service. It could advocate steps to prevent unintended pregnancies.
Of course, it should continue to support "conscience clauses" that
respect the right of pro-life doctors and other health professionals not to
be involved in abortion. Pro-choice does not necessarily mean proabortion.
The AMA, which started this fray so many years ago, could
show the way to a new era by promoting not only a doctor's right to
choose to perform abortions, but also a woman's right to have one.

[^8/13]: Mohr, _Abortion in America_, 245

[^8/14]: In today's overheated abortion debate,
th is a running argument over what happened in the last century. Historians and
legal scholars in recent years have submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme
Court and published articles in professional journals arguing about public attitudes and
legal views concerning abortion from colonial times until before the AMA campaign. Supporters
of abortion rights argue the regular medical profession's antiabortion attitudes,
encouraged by the AMA crusade, were an aberration. They said the framers of the Constitution
tolerated abortion before quickening. On the other hand, pro-lifers argue there is
evidence in the common law that antiabortion attitudes existed in America before the AMA
crusade. They contend the AMA crusade merely toughened sanctions against abortion.
They believe the doctors' campaign was more than a gimmick to professionalize medicine.
Both sides think the group that owns the past may control the present by influencing the
Supreme Court. There is no doubt, however, that the AMA provided a base from which
Storer and like-minded colleagues helped shape public opinion and policy to criminalize
abortion
