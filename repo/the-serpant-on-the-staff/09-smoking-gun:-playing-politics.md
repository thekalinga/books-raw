# Smoking Gun: Playing Politics with Tobacco and the Public's Health[^7/0]

The American Medical Association
holds itself up as an advocate for the public's health, but it has had an
often shameful record on the biggest public health catastrophe of our
time, the tobacco epidemic. The death and disability from tobacco use is
staggering. In this century, 14 million Americans have died from lung
cancer, heart disease, and other tobacco-caused diseases. Each year in excess
of 400,000 Americans die from tobacco-related disease, more than
the combined death toll from AIDS, murder, accidents, alcohol and drug
abuse, and suicide. The tobacco epidemic conservatively costs the economy
$68 billion each year, in direct health-care costs, loss of productivity
from illness, and foregone earnings of those who die prematurely from
smoking-related causes.[^7/1]

The AMA has had a long and intimate connection with tobacco, but
unfortunately the nation's largest physician group, pursuing its own
agenda, often has done more to promote tobacco interests than it has
"the betterment of the public health"---one of its founding missions.
The AMA's activities on tobacco can be divided into three periods. In the
first, starting in the mid-1930s and lasting until the mid-1950s, at a time
when the first scientific links between smoking and disease were being
made, the AMA, through its journal, played a significant role in helping
to promote cigarettes. Then, from the mid-1950s until the early 1980s, as
evidence regarding the dangers of smoking became overwhelming, the
AMA not only maintained a virtual silence on tobacco, but collaborated
with tobacco interests. In the third period, from the mid-1980s onward,
pushed by idealistic medical students and young doctors, the AMA increasingly
has spoken out against tobacco, but it generally has not used
the full force of its political clout to persuade Congress to control the tobacco
epidemic.

The AMA's savvy and resources have been sorely missed as smaller,
less well-connected health groups have engaged in a monumental battle
against an entrenched industry with a huge bankroll and a strong survival
instinct. The American tobacco industry generates more than
$50 billion a year in revenue and employs some 700,000 people. Legislation
to restrict and discourage tobacco use usually does not get passed.
Quite simply, because of politics and money, people are dying or becoming
disabled by tobacco-caused disease.

## CIGARETTE HUCKSTERISM AND THE AMA

Back in the 1930s, the AMA played a role in establishing cigarettes as a
popular product. The AMA helped develop and then accepted in its
journal advertisements that made cigarettes appear to be a physicianendorsed
product. Coping with the hard times from the Great Depression,
the physician group hit upon a previously untapped source of
revenue: opening the _AMA Journal_ to advertisements for nonmedical
products. Soon, cigarette ads became a regular feature in the most widely
read and highly respected physician publication.

By this time some researchers had begun to report in medical journals
that lung cancer---then a rare disease---appeared to be linked to
smoking. But this message had yet to penetrate the consciousness of doctors,
let alone the general public.

In fact, cigarette makers laced their ads with health messages. "The
American smoker during the '30s and '40s could have been forgiven for
confusing his favorite brand of cigarettes with the latest wonder drug,"
said former senator Maurine B. Neuberger (D-Ore.), a reformed smoker
turned smoking reformer in the 1960s. Examples of slogans were "Not a
cough in a carload" for Old Gold, and "Not one single case of throat irritation
due to smoking Camels."[^7/2]

Philip Morris, a brand from an upstart cigarette manufacturer destined
for market domination, ran perhaps the boldest, most successful
campaign. In ads aimed at the public, diminutive bellhop Johnny Roventini,
who belted out the signature phrase "Call for Philip Morris," hinted
that his brand was "definitely less irritating." And in ads for the influential
medical profession, Philip Morris used what it claimed was scientific
documentation to hawk its smokes. Starting in November 1935, Philip
Morris ads in medical publications, most prominently _JAMA_, touted an
additive known as diethylene glycol, a chemical that moistened tobacco
contained in cigarettes. Philip Morris said its research showed diethylene
glycol made its cigarette milder than competing brands, which used another
agent, glycerine.[^7/3]

Unbeknownst to physicians and the public, America's most celebrated
physician, a man intimately identified with the AMA, was working
behind the scenes to help Philip Morris design its sales strategy. He was
Dr. Morris Fishbein. Though the public came to think of him as being
the AMA's president, he actually was the editor of the _Journal_. He was so
well known in his time that the Marx Brothers casually used his name in a
joke in their film _Room Service_.

When Philip Morris management first got fired up about diethylene
glycol, company scientists approached Fishbein about the possibility of
promoting the moistening agent in Philip Morris ads in the _Journal_. After
examining the data, Fishbein told Philip Morris that the research failed
to substantiate the company's claims. Fishbein told Philip Morris what
steps to take to document the benefits of diethylene glycol.[^7/4]

Philip Morris followed Fishbein's advice and paid pharmacologist
Michael G. Mulinos, of the Columbia University College of Physicians
and Surgeons, to conduct research on diethylene glycol. In his study,
which appeared in the _New York State Journal of Medicine_ in June 1935,
Mulinos reported that of the unnamed brands, the one with diethylene
glycol caused three times less swelling to rabbits' eyes than did those with
glycerine.[^7/5] Philip Morris made this research and some clinical studies in
humans the basis for ad campaigns in _JAMA_ and other medical journals
from 1935 until the 1950s. The ads offered doctors free packs of Philip
Morris along with reprints of the studies. Philip Morris' chief chemist
and nine assistants attended all major medical meetings to explain
Mulinos' research and to hype the supposed benefits of diethylene
glycol. The company even dispatched representatives to doctors' offices
to give them free cigarettes and a pep talk on diethylene glycol.[^7/6]

The campaign was a major success, vaulting Philip Morris into the
top ranks of cigarette sellers. Philip Morris was so grateful to Fishbein for
guiding them that one of its managers offered him a retainer. (The executive
later said the firm had $25,000 a year in mind, though the sum
was not mentioned to Fishbein. At the time, Fishbein's annual AMA salary
was $20,000 with $10,000 to $20,000 added from his books and
other writings. [^7/7] The _JAMA_ editor declined, saying that helping the company
was his pleasure.)

In the 1940s, other manufacturers copied the approach of using
science and physicians to sell cigarettes. Ads for Camels, with Norman
Rockwellesque scenes of wholesome children and kindly doctors, proclaimed:
"More Doctors Smoke Camels Than Any Other Cigarette." The
manufacturer in its ads invited doctors to visit Camels' scientific exhibit
at the 1947 AMA convention.

Fishbein went out of his way to support Philip Morris in a few instances
in which diethylene glycol was embroiled in controversy. In the
most serious incident, a Southern drug manufacturer used the chemical,
without testing, in production of a newly released liquid version of the
first antibacterial medicine, sulfanilamide. Suddenly, in October 1937,
people started dying; all told, more than 100 were killed, many of them
children. The AMA help prove diethylene glycol was the culprit.

Philip Morris was quite disturbed by the episode because the moistening
agent was the centerpiece of its physician campaign. Fishbein
came to the rescue. In the midst of the tragedy, _JAMA_ ran an editorial
emphasizing that diethylene glycol was used safely in many places in industry,
including as an ingredient in cigarettes.[^7/8] With Fishbein's help,
Philip Morris continued to advertise to doctors about diethylene glycol
without the public being any the wiser.

## TOBACCO DANGERS NAILED DOWN

In the 1950s the evidence started to become overwhelming that cigarettes
caused not only lung cancer but heart disease and other ailments.
But the AMA, and the federal government for that matter, had not taken
the issue seriously. Meanwhile, the public was confused by the simultaneous
appearance of scary studies in the press linking health hazards
to smoking and upbeat ads for cigarettes.

In May 1950 _JAMA_ published the first large study on tobacco. Medical
student Ernst Wynder and surgeon Evarts Graham, of Washington
University in St. Louis, found that 96.5 percent of patients with lung cancer
in their hospitals had been smokers.[^7/9] More research followed in the
mid-1950s.

Finally, in 1957 the federal government took notice. Surgeon General
Leroy Burney broke the government's silence, telling a televised
news conference that longtime cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.
This potential public health bombshell was a dud because it failed to
mobilize medicine's leader, the AMA, to tackle the tobacco issue. Diplomatically,
Burney recalled that the AMA "had a rather detached, armslength
attitude." [^7/10]

The risks were starting to penetrate the clouds of cigarette smoke, so
commonplace in the 1950s. _Reader's Digest_, among the first publishers to
refuse cigarette advertising, ran a string of frightening articles about
smoking, such as one entitled "Cancer by the Carton." Tobacco sales leveled
off and then declined slightly in the early 1950s. The tobacco companies
were becoming as worried as the smokers.

The manufacturers recognized they needed to reassure consumers
and tried a variety of tacks to create the impression that cigarettes were
safe. One approach was to link cigarettes with health and doctors. Liggett
& Myers' ads for its L&M brand claimed its filters were "Just what the
doctor ordered." Philip Morris revived claims of benefits from diethylene
glycol, this time plugged as "Di-GL" in ads aimed at consumers.
In radio ads, Philip Morris bragged that Di-GL, found exclusively in its
brand, "took the fear out of smoking."

### The Micronite Filtered Truth: The AMA Connection

The AMA was considered such a patsy on the tobacco issue that one
manufacturer ran a shameless campaign based on its commercial links
with the AMA. However, to its credit, the AMA did for the first time resist
the temptation of cigarette advertising, although more to placate its
other advertisers than to protect the public from a health hazard.

In March 1952, P. Lorillard Co., manufacturer of Kent, sent letters
to all American doctors to introduce them to Kent's Micronite filter,
which Lorillard said offered "health protection," and suggested physicians
prescribe these cigarettes to smokers with sore throats or other
problems from smoking. Lorillard included free samples for the doctors
to try.

Lorillard then made the AMA connection. It ran ads in _JAMA_ in
1952 that mentioned the products' benefits had been authenticated in a
booth at the 1952 AMA convention. Under headlines including HAVE
You HEARD THE STORY OF NEW KENT CIGARETTES, DOCTOR? and DocTOR
... HAVE YOU TRIED THE NEW KENT CIGARETTE?, Lorillard told the
readers of _JAMA_ and other medical journals: "At the recent Convention
of the American Medical Association, thousands of physicians heard the
Kent story, and saw a convincing demonstration of the MICRONITE
FILTER'S phenomenal effectiveness."

Some physicians complained about these tactics to the AMA. And
some pharmaceutical companies were nervous that cigarette ads, which
the AMA did not carefully scrutinize, might discredit drug ads appearing
in _JAMA_. On October 31, 1953, the AMA acted. In a letter to tobacco
companies, it said that beginning January 1, 1954, its publications would
no longer accept their ads, and its scientific meetings would ban cigarette
exhibits. The decision cost the AMA more than $100,000 a year in
income.[^7/11]

But the AMA had a hard time distancing itself from cigarette advertising
because of an earlier decision to study some of the claims being
made in the cigarette-filter wars. The AMA's Advertising Committee requested
the AMA Chemical Laboratory, which primarily tested drugs for
purity and potency, to study the effectiveness of filters. It was an area rich
with advertising claims but with a scarcity of published data. Dr. Walter
Wolman, former director of the AMA Chemical Laboratory, said the
AMA Advertising Department wanted the filters studied as part of its
efforts to sell advertising and to help keep ad claims "within the limits of
AMA policy."[^7/12]

The AMA Chemical Laboratory published its comparison of filtered
and "regular" brands in July 1953. No filter was especially effective, but
an unidentified filter on "Brand B-2" did better than the rest. From the
description of the cigarettes, it was easy enough to determine which
brand was which. The Kent Micronite filter, the only mineral filter in the
study, was the most effective, though it still let through 59 percent of the
nicotine and 56 percent of the tars.

Despite the unimpressive results, Lorillard latched on to the AMA
study. Without AMA authorization, the firm in 1954 ran advertisements
in _Life_, _Time_, and other popular magazines that cited the Micronite filter's
supposed superiority in AMA lab tests. The ads, appearing to confer on
Kent filters an AMA seal of approval, stressed that the AMA studies were
"voluntary and independent," and claimed they "proved" the Micronite
filter was "the most effective." It was cigarette puffery at its worst. The
AMA was paying a price for its cozy relations with the tobacco companies.

In April 1954, in an editorial entitled "Cigarette Hucksterism and
the AMA," the AMA and _JAMA_ blasted Kent for unauthorized use of
their names. They condemned the Kent ad campaign as "an outrageous
example of commercial exploitation of the American medical profession."
The editorial went on to belittle Lorillard's claims, saying that "a
completely efficient filter would permit the smoker to inhale nothing but
hot air!"[^7/13]

Lorillard promptly rebutted the _JAMA_ editorial with new ads that
used the original ad as a backdrop to a text block that directed interested
readers to the specific references supporting their claims in _JAMA_: "We
have been told that the American Medical Association does not endorse
any products in this field. But the type of filter that proved most effective
in the tests is a type that is used only by KENT. ..."[^7/14]

(Ironically, Dr. Morris Fishbein, the former _JAMA_ editor, who helped
introduce the idea of using medical research to sell cigarettes, was a "research
consultant" to Lorillard. Fishbein, who now received a $25,000a-year
retainer from the firm, tells in his autobiography of helping to design
the clinical experiments with the Micronite filter that served as the
basis for Kent's ads.) [^7/15]

The AMA's decision to ban cigarette ads and to attack Lorillard represented
the end of an era. No longer would the AMA be used blatantly
to sell cigarettes. However, the AMA was far from making a clean break
from the tobacco industry.

## STRANGE BEDFELLOWS: THE AMA AND THE TOBACCO BARONS

By the early to mid-1960s, most health groups as well as the federal government
recognized the time had come to take definitive action against
tobacco. But the AMA did not join this effort; instead it collaborated with
cigarette makers on projects the industry hoped would help keep the
heat off them.

In 1963 the AMA announced and then backed down on a plan to
study smoking. The AMA said it felt its study was superfluous because
the Surgeon General, at the urging of President John F. Kennedy, was
undertaking a large-scale study on cigarettes.

Then, on December 4, 1963, the AMA House of Delegates reversed
itself and decided to launch an intensive basic-research program on
smoking to "probe beyond statistical evidence" to determine whether
smoking caused diseases. This sort of statement made the AMA sound a
bit like the tobacco industry, which in the face of criticism always asserted
that "statistical" or epidemiologic links between tobacco and disease did
not prove tobacco causes those diseases. The AMA's goal, like the tobacco
industry's, was to develop a benign cigarette, making smoking safe for
America.

After putting $500,000 of its own into the kitty, the AMA set out to
obtain additional research money from industry, health associations, and
other sources. The Tobacco Institute was thrilled by the announcement---for
years it had been looking for ways to work with the AMA, and
now the opportunity was at hand. [^7/16]

With release of the Surgeon General's report expected soon, the
AMA was sending signals that it was willing to support the industry. AMA
president Edward R. Annis in early January 1964 warned the state legislature
in Kentucky that the government soon would present "insurmountable
evidence that smoking causes cancer." He buoyed up the
spirits of these tobacco-state legislators by saying that while his organization
opposed disease, "The AMA is not opposed to smoking and tobacco."[^7/17]

On January 11, 1964, Surgeon General Luther Terry released the
study on tobacco and health. He considered the report so sensitive that
he presented it on a Saturday when the stock market was closed.

Based on a fourteen-month review of thousands of previously conducted
studies, including experiments on animals, autopsy-based investigations,
and population studies, the panel concluded the evidence was
strong enough to state that smoking caused lung cancer, an uncommon
disease before the advent of cheap, mass-produced cigarettes. The panel
also said the research linked smoking to emphysema, coronary artery
disease, and a host of other diseases. The committee concluded that "remedial
action," such as warning labels on cigarette packs and control of
advertising, was in order. [^7/18]

As expected, the tobacco industry questioned the validity of the report,
saying that a statistical link between smoking and a disease was far
from proving a causal relationship. But doctors were stunned when the
AMA also downplayed the Surgeon General's report. AMA president
Annis said _more research_ was needed to discover "how tobacco smoke affects
health, and, if possible, to eliminate whatever element may induce
disease \[because it is\] unrealistic to assume the American people are suddenly
going to quit smoking."[^7/19]

On January 31, nearly three weeks after the Surgeon General issued
his landmark report, the AMA Education and Research Foundation
(AMA-ERF) appointed a committee to direct the research program, including
three researchers who served on the Surgeon General's advisory
committee and two who previously had done research sponsored by the
tobacco industry. On February 7, 1964, the six major tobacco companies
agreed to pay $10 million over five years for the AMA-ERF project. [^7/20]

Because it accepted this tobacco money, the AMA was prevented
from leading the charge against a public health menace. Hence, the
AMA presented a _neutral, balanced_ message in a six-page brochure entitled
"Smoking: Facts You Should Know," published in May 1964. The
booklet stressed the dangers of burns and suffocation from falling asleep
while smoking, and warned about the costly damage cigarettes could
do to sofas, rugs, and clothing. But it characterized the major risks
connected with long-term smoking about which the Surgeon General
had warned as "suspected health hazards." The AMA brochure stated
_some researchers_ thought smoking "shortens life expectancy" and is "alleged
to cause cancer of the lungs and bladder." On the other hand, the
AMA said: "Some equally competent physicians and research personnel
are less sure of the effect of cigarette smoking on health. Smoke if you
feel you should, but be moderate."[^7/21]

The House of Delegates was under pressure at its annual meeting in
June 1964 to take a stand on the Surgeon General's report. Delegates
had to reconcile Terry's warnings with the fact that AMA-ERF had accepted
$10 million in tobacco industry funds. In the end, the House concluded
smoking had a "significant relationship" to lung cancer, a weaker
position than that taken by the Surgeon General. [^7/22]

After three years, the AMA's research effort couldn't avoid finding
health problems linked to smoking. In 1967 Dr. Maurice H. Seevers, who
chaired the AMA-ERF committee and also had served on the Surgeon
General's panel, said in the _AMA Journal_ that "certainly there are no
scientific data that would contradict the basic tenets of the Surgeon General's
report." The University of Michigan pharmacologist said the AMA
and the industry were committed, although for different reasons, to get
to the bottom of issues of tobacco and health.[^7/23]

So the money kept flowing to the AMA-ERF, which passed funds on
to the researchers. In 1968 the tobacco companies committed $8 million
more to the research. The advantages for the cigarette makers were
clear. The project afforded them some cover for years. They could always
point to the AMA-ERF project as evidence that not all the answers were
in on tobacco's possible links to health problems.

By the early 1970s, the AMA was starting to experience some doubts
about accepting the tobacco money, according to a confidential Tobacco
Institute document. The memo revealed that on September 3, 1971,
William Kloepfer, vice president of public relations of the Tobacco Institute,
informed Horace R. Kornegay, the organization's president, that
the research arrangement with the AMA was in danger. Kloepfer said
Dr. Ernest B. Howard, the AMA's executive vice president, had told
him the program was "a great liability ... from AMA's view it has only
caused further blackening of the AMA's image." The AMA wanted out,
Kloepfer said, but the organization "_is most anxious to avoid any incident
which will create displeasure with the AMA among tobacco area Congressmen--
he said AMA needs their support urgently_." (Emphasis added)[^7/24]

### In Cahoots with Tobacco Congressmen

Years before this memo was written, the AMA had been accused publicly
of being in cahoots with tobacco-state congressmen. This conservative
bloc saw eye-to-eye with the AMA on such issues as restricting federal
government controls in general and opposing the Medicare health program
for the elderly. In a quid pro quo, the AMA helped its friends in
Congress by taking positions on tobacco that from a public health perspective
at best were neutral, but at worst were at odds with those of
other major health and medical groups. For instance, when the Federal
Trade Commission suggested in 1964 that cigarette packages should
carry warnings, the AMA shocked commissioners by opposing them. In a
letter written three weeks after the tobacco interests funded the AMAERF
project, Dr. F. J. L. Blasingame, the AMA's chief executive, told the
FTC: "Since it is evident that cigarette smoking will continue despite any
restrictive labeling that might be imposed, it is our opinion that the answer
that will do \[the\] most to protect the public health lies not in labeling
(which is likely to be ignored), but in research," he wrote, as if both approaches
could not be undertaken simultaneously.

Blasingame parroted the tobacco industry stand when he stated:
"More than 90 million persons in the United States use tobacco in some
form; and, of these, 72 million use cigarettes. Long standing social
customs and practices are established in the use of tobacco; the economic
lives of tobacco growers, processors, and merchants are entwined
in the industry; and local, state and federal governments are the recipients
of and dependent upon many millions of dollars of tax revenue.
For these reasons, it is most appropriate that a subject of this magnitude,
regarding the labeling and advertising of tobacco, be controlled by the
Congress of the United States in the form of enacted legislation, if any,
rather than promulgated administrative regulations."[^7/25]

The AMA position sent the medical world into a spin. The American
Cancer Society, the Public Health Service, and many physician groups
supported warning labels and tightening of regulation of cigarette advertising.
Responding to the AMA's startling stand, FTC commissioner
A. Everett MacIntyre said: "I'm really perplexed. Thousands of doctors
and many individual medical societies favor the proposed warnings, but
the AMA ... \[says\] there is no further need for educational statements
to the youth. This is precisely the position of the tobacco industry."

Dr. Alton Ochsner, an eminent chest surgeon from Tulane University
School of Medicine, was angered. He was an expert on the cigarettelung
cancer connection, having noted as early as 1910 an unusual case of
lung cancer in a smoker and reported on the link in the 1930s. He said
the AMA was being "derelict" as a leader in health and its industrysupported
research on tobacco was just delaying tactics" because smoking
was so obviously harmful. "Personally, I think the AMA is wrong in
conducting more research. I think we have the answers right now," he said.

Blasingame shot back: "It seems to me that Dr. Ochsner and those
who share his opinion are really advocating that an agency of the federal
government be granted the power to destroy an $8 billion industry on
the extreme theory that the American people need to be protected from
themselves in the matter of smoking."[^7/26]

U.S. Representative Frank Thompson Jr., (D-N.J.), an advocate for
the Medicare plan to cover the hospitalization of the elderly, went for the
jugular. He charged the AMA was siding with the tobacco industry in exchange
for votes against Medicare. "It's an outrage and it's an obvious
plot," he said. However, Representative Harold D. Cooley, a North Carolina
Democrat, himself a tobacco grower, a leader in the tobacco bloc in
Congress and chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, defended
the AMA, contending Thompson's charges were "not only untrue-it
is fantastic and an outrage to the House." Blasingame in turn told
Thompson the charges were "slanderous ... an unjustified assault on
the integrity of the officials of the AMA and upon your colleagues in the
Congress."[^7/27]

As to the warning labels, the AMA strategy of having Congress decide
won. In a classic deal, tobacco-state congressmen agreed to put
warning labels on cigarette packs in exchange for a promise that warnings
would be kept out of cigarette advertising for at least five years. Following
this precedent, the tobacco industry has left its mark on virtually
all legislation relating to tobacco and health, showing a willingness to
concede on some points in exchange for not getting clobbered with
something worse.

In exchange, tobacco-state congressmen helped impede passage
of Medicare legislation. In the midst of their meeting in 1964,
AMA delegates rose to their feet and cheered when it was announced
that the House Ways and Means Committee had failed to pass Medicare.
[^7/28]

The AMA and the tobacco industry had become a mutual-aid
society. Despite AMA denials of collusion with tobacco interests, the confidential
memo from the Tobacco Institute reveals the AMA's extraordinary
concern about offending tobacco-state congressmen. Muckrakers
Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson described the AMA-tobacco industry
relationship as "the weirdest lobbying alliance in legislative history."
They said the doctors' lobby and the cigarette lobby worked in tandem:
"The doctors were more concerned about Medicare, which they fancied
to be a threat to their fees, than about the threat to the nation's lungs. So it
happened that those who abet and those who cure illness lay down together
in millennial bliss."[^7/29]

### The AMA Echos the Surgeon General Fourteen Years Later

Tobacco-industry-funded research under the auspices of AMA-ERF
continued until 1972, having involved some 844 researchers who worked
on 219 separate projects. In 1978, fourteen years after the original funding
was obtained, the AMA released its concluding report, summarizing
the AMA-ERF studies, most of which were six to twelve years old. The
AMA group said its research "had not altered the conclusions of the
1964 report of the Surgeon General."[^7/30]

But more interesting than the AMA-ERF report itself was the AMA's
use of its release to harass the President. The AMA's report was publicized
while Carter was visiting tobacco country. At the time, tobacco interests
were up in arms over the campaign against smoking being waged
by Joseph Califano, Jr. , Carter's Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.
Califano, a reformed three-pack-a-day smoker, described smoking
as "slow-motion suicide. ... Public Health Enemy Number One." Politically,
Carter must have agreed with bumper stickers cropping up in the
tobacco belt: CALIFANO IS DANGEROUS TO MY HEALTH. On the defensive, the
Georgia Democrat joked to a pro-tobacco audience that Califano had encouraged
him to visit: "He said it was time for the White House staff to
start smoking something regular"---a reference to media reports about
marijuana use by members of his staff.[^7/31]

Responding to the AMA-ERF study, Carter said: "Nobody need fear
the facts about tobacco use. Certainly, no one need fear the emphasis on
research that will make the use of tobacco in the future even more safe
than it has been in the past." The Tobacco Institute said it could not have
written it better.

But the institute contended that the AMA "contrived" release of the
document to humiliate Carter. Dr. James H. Sammons, the AMA's executive
vice president, denied these charges, claiming "a series of "unforeseen
circumstances," including strikes resulting in delays in producing
the clothbound cover and in obtaining packing material, an equipment
malfunction in printing news releases, and an error in mailing. Whatever
the reason, it served the AMA's purpose to embarrass Carter, who encountered
AMA opposition to his plan to save billions in medical costs by
capping hospital bills. Playing both sides of the fence, the AMA ultimately
defeated the legislation with the help of Southern legislators. [^7/32]

Meanwhile the AMA-ERF report gave the AMA some standing as a
tobacco opponent, and the group in 1978 was invited to testify concerning
its report on tobacco before the House Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations. This was the first time the AMA had appeared before
Congress on this issue since Surgeon General Terry issued the first warning
in 1964. Around this time, in a Senate Subcommittee on Health and
Scientific Research hearing on a health-promotion act in 1978, the AMA
revealed without fanfare that it favored legislation to create warning
labels on cigarette packages with changing messages and other antitobacco
measures. This was fourteen years after the AMA had first opposed
warning labels. At last the AMA seemed to be acting like a group of
doctors concerned about its patients' health. However, the AMA's powerful
lobby did not pick up the ball and run on the tobacco issue. The AMA
would not testify before Congress on tobacco issues again for another
seven years, until 1985.

## STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS REBEL AGAINST AMA SILENCE

Meanwhile the AMA waffled on, failing to take the lead on the tobacco
issue. In 1979 Congress had before it more than a dozen bills aimed at
reducing smoking, an addiction the federal government then estimated
was responsible for more than 300,000 deaths a year. The legislation attempted
to strengthen warning labels on cigarette packages and advertisements,
regulate smoking on airplanes, eliminate advertising expenses
as a business deduction by manufacturers, prohibit cigarette makers
from adding chemicals to prevent cigarettes from extinguishing themselves,
and boost taxes on cigarettes in hopes of persuading smokers
to quit.

By this time the AMA officially supported some of these approaches
to control tobacco. But some medical-student and young-physician
members of the AMA began wondering if the AMA was putting its legendary
clout in Washington behind antitobacco legislation. Ronald M.
Davis, the AMA student delegate, was outraged when he reviewed the
AMA's list of statements to Congress and federal agencies. The University
of Chicago student found the AMA had not testified on any of the
legislation, and had not even written a single letter in support of the antitobacco
bills consistent with AMA policy. The AMA had chosen to be silent
and wasn't lobbying against tobacco.

The Student Business Section introduced at the AMA annual meeting
in 1980 a resolution that Davis wrote, calling on the House of Delegates
to "reaffirm its commitment to improving the health of the
American people by commencing vigorous, persistent and ongoing lobbying
for smoking-related bills." The get-tough resolution also called on
the AMA to report annually on the status of smoking-related legislation
and what AMA lobbyists had done regarding each of them.

There was a sinking suspicion among some students and physicians
in training that the AMA was on the side of the tobacco industry. As a
final"resolve," the students drew a line in the sand, demanding the AMA
to show where it stood on tobacco. They pressed the AMA to acknowledge
that it opposed the tobacco industry, and to affirm that "the health
of the American public as a whole supersedes all other concerns."

The AMA had to think about the question, though. It had courted
the students and young physicians, whom it desperately needed as members
to sustain the organization, but older, established doctors generally
did not share the young people's vision of what the AMA ought to be
doing. After holding a hearing, a reference committee urged that the
House of Delegates reject Davis's resolution. The committee argued that
the AMA already had done its bit to fight tobacco. More seasoned delegates
thought it would cause an undue burden on AMA lobbyists to fight
for antitobacco legislation in the face of other pressing problems, such as
Medicare funding and government regulation of medicine, with which it
was contending at the time.

Sensing defeat, the students submitted a watered-down amendment
that merely called on delegates to go on record as requesting the AMA's
Washington lobbyists to _monitor_ tobacco legislation and to inform delegates
of any important developments. But even this amendment received
a cool reaction. Dr. E. William Dowda, a delegate from Georgia,
spoke out against adopting the resolution merely to "appease" the students.
The Atlanta internist, a nonsmoker himself, said the AMA had
only "so many Brownie points per year" it could use to gain access to
Congress. "If the lobbyists became involved with smoking, then they are
going to have to give up something in the health legislative line," Dowda
said. "I realize that it is a windmill that the Student Section has, and of
course I also have my own windmills. I respect theirs and I hope they respect
mine, but I think at this time we should not do anything to impair
the effectiveness of our Washington lobbyists. ...[^7/33]

Some delegates were extremely callous about tobacco. One, a prominent
university professor, said: "Smoking is not all that much of a problem
because those who get cancer of the lungs don't last very long but
other things (diseases) do." Comments denigrating the significance of
the students' resolution and the tobacco issue embarrassed other delegates.
The House of Delegates was humiliated into supporting the diluted
resolution.

Dr. Daniel T. Cloud, a pediatric surgeon from Phoenix, who served
as AMA president in 1981--82, discovered that the worst fears and suspicions
of the students and residents about AMA lobbyists not pushing tobacco
issues had a basis in truth. As he traveled around the country
making speeches, Cloud pointed out that half of health-care costs were
tied to preventable diseases, such as smoking-induced cancers and heart
disease.

After one speech was reported in the press, Cloud recalled that the
AMA received a letter from Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican
who was tobacco's No. 1 champion. Helms's letter expressed
displeasure with the antitobacco positions being taken by some AMA officials.
Cloud said the AMA's chief executive, Dr. Sammons, "was very distressed
about the letter. He called me. He was upset that I might answer
it, and he persuaded me not to write an answer. He said that Senator
Helms had written it to satisfy his constituency and that no reply was
needed. \[Sammons\] said, "I've been in telephone contact with him. It's a
done deal now. They've written their letter. They're going to show their
people they wrote us and scolded us and now that's the end of it.'"

Cloud said it dawned on him that "this was sort of the game we were
playing. I guess there had been a tacit understanding prior to that time
between the tobacco-state lawmakers and the AMA that the AMA would
lay off, if the tobacco people would support us in the fight against the
government." He added, "We did have support \[from the Southern bloc\],
and we got the support because of our laying off the tobacco issue," said
the former AMA president. Smoking was striking down Americans by
the hundreds of thousands a year, but, Cloud said, "We were not standing
up. We were not doing what \[Reagan-era Surgeon General C. Everett\]
'Chick'Koop was doing and beating the drums against tobacco."[^7/34]

## INVESTING IN TOBACCO

The AMA not only got into bed politically with tobacco interests, but it
even to a small extent bet its members' pensions on the economic success
of the tobacco industry. In 1979 the resident physicians, under the leadership
of Dr. Alan Blum, founder of Doctors Ought to Care (DOC), a
health-promotion group, learned that the AMA's Members Retirement
Fund owned $1.4 million in tobacco securities. The young doctors
quietly tried to persuade AMA management to unload the stock. But
AMA chief Sammons told the residents in a letter in October 1979 that it
was not appropriate for the AMA to "inject itself into the investment
field" and order its fund managers not to buy tobacco stocks. He was concerned
that other special interests within the AMA would try to tell the
organization how to invest. Sammons said that the point of the funds was
to make money, and besides, the AMA-owned tobacco stocks represented
less than 3 percent of the AMA portfolio.[^7/35] In other words, the AMA was
not about to sell the stock.

In summer 1980, disgruntled residents persuaded the AMA Resident
Physicians Section to present a resolution to the House of Delegates
declaring "that AMA fiduciary responsibility to the public is greater than
its fiduciary responsibility to its investment portfolio." When the matter
came up before the House in 1981, the residents were rebuffed by their
elders. Dr. John J. Coury, Jr., chairman of the AMA Board's finance committee,
argued that the purpose of the pension fund was "to make the
biggest buck," not to make social statements. He contended that interfering
with the investment managers would violate federal Security and
Exchange Commission regulations. AMA officials also attempted to minimize
the issue by noting that "tobacco" companies were highly diversified
and were involved in many nontobacco industries. [^7/36]

Advocates for selling the stock as a matter of principle lost the battle
but they won the war. Newspaper editorialists and cartoonists had "a field
day" with the AMA and its tobacco stocks, said an AMA spokeswoman.
For instance, one editorial cartoon in the _Chicago Tribune_ depicted a doctor
speaking to a patient about his tobacco habit. In the background is a
newspaper with the headline CIGARETTE STOCK IN AMA PENSION FUND. The
doctor states: "I can't say this strongly enough, Mr. Morson. ... If your
cigarettes are made by anybody other than Philip Morris or Reynolds Industries,
you've got to stop smoking!"[^7/37]

The bad publicity was causing heartburn at AMA headquarters.
Quietly, the portfolio managers sold off the tobacco stocks. In 1985, the
AMA officially informed its investment brokers that tobacco securities
could not be purchased without prior approval by the AMA Board or its
finance committee. What the AMA leadership lacked in conscience, it
substituted with sensitivity to public relations and image [^7/38]

## THE TOBACCO-GROWING AMA PRESIDENT

The AMA leaders' resolve to fight tobacco was challenged in a very personal
way at the June 1985 meeting. It was a turning point that resulted
in the organization's going on the record with stronger antitobacco
policy.

Dr. A. Stuart Hanson, an AMA alternate delegate from Minnesota,
told a hearing at the meeting: "The AMA is an embarrassment to me. We
need to have our own house in order." The Minneapolis lung specialist
said AMA leaders ought to be at the vanguard in the war against tobacco.
However, he said, two of the AMA's top leaders had difficulty refraining
from puffing in public, and two AMA Board members, though nonsmokers,
owned a farm on which tobacco was grown. Hanson said the
AMA leaders had to change their ways if they wanted the organization to
retain any measure of trust from the public, the profession, and its own
membership.

The AMA confirmed to the _Chicago Sun-Times_, the only general press
covering the session, that two of its board members, Dr. Harrison L.
Rogers, the AMA's president-elect, who was to be inaugurated two days
later, and board member Dr. F. William Dowda, Rogers' longtime friend
from Atlanta, owned a 200-acre farm near the Okefenokee Swamp in
Georgia, on which a tenant farmer grew tobacco on seven acres. The
AMA management defended the doctors' right to invest as they pleased.
It also verified that its board chairman, Dr. Coury, and its outgoing president,
Dr. Joseph F. Boyle, were "less than successful in their attempts to
quit smoking."[^7/39]

The AMA Board circled its wagons. But behind closed doors, Dr.
Ronald Davis, who as a medical student had raised questions about the
AMA's lack of action on tobacco and now was a resident-member of the
board, offered an emotional and spirited defense of Hanson and expressed
his own embarrassment about the situation. "I just defended
him and the importance of symbolism," said Davis in an interview later.
But his fellow board members essentially felt that their tobacco-farming
and tobacco-smoking confreres had been victims of a "cheap shot." Outspoken
opposition to tobacco had not yet become fashionable among the
AMA's elite, who at the time still were provided their favorite cigarette
brands while staying at the Needham House, the AMA's posh town house
in Georgetown.

The symbolism of an AMA leader owning a farm on which tobacco
was grown did not escape Rogers. He announced he was considering his
options. He said in an interview years later: "I did not really want to
remain in that position of having to go around the country and answer
that question every time I hit some new town. You know, "Why do you
grow tobacco?"" After a few months, he sold his portion of the farm to
Dowda.[^7/40]

### AMA Delegates Get on the Antismoking Bandwagon

At this same meeting, where AMA leaders were vilified for their tobacco
ties, delegates began building a strong antitobacco platform. They
churned out antitobacco resolutions at an unprecedented pace. Of the
more than one hundred statements on tobacco listed by the AMA in its
policy book in 1993,80 percent were adopted from 1985 onward.

In June 1985 the House approved a package of resolutions aimed at
fighting tobacco and polishing the tarnished image of the House of Medicine.
Dr. Ed L. Calhoon, a delegate from Beaver, Oklahoma, and a member
of the federal government's National Cancer Advisory Board, urged
delegates to take a strong stance because the nation's largest medical
group had been perceived by some of its members and the public as
being "a bit negligent in trying to speak to this issue." Delegates passed a
resolution introduced by Calhoon entitled "A Smoke-Free Society by the
Year 2000," which put the AMA on record as undertaking "a major
effort" to strengthen its antismoking activities.[^7/41]

The AMA also decided to get its own house in order. Delegates urged
all physicians to stop using tobacco products and ordered the association's
top staff to discourage smoking inside the Chicago headquarters
and offer assistance to employees to quit. The delegates adopted a resolution
requesting the AMA to support programs to eliminate smoking
indoors where it would be harmful to others. Following the June 1985
meeting, the AMA removed cigarette vending machines from its headquarters.
Delegates also called for an end to federal price supports for
tobacco. The AMA once again seemed to be on its way to combating the
tobacco epidemic.

## OPPOSING LAWSUITS TO FIGHT TOBACCO

However, the AMA Board announced a plan at the December 1985
meeting that appeared to place the self-interest of physicians in preventing
malpractice suits ahead of its opposition to tobacco. The new flap
arose when the board issued a report calling for opposition to a campaign
by some tobacco foes to urge that the victims of tobacco-induced
disease or their survivors file liability suits against tobacco companies.
The board report characterized the liability suits as "an ineffective and
unwieldy tool for shaping public policy" that would cause "a prohibitively
high cost to society." The board contended that education and legislation
would have greater impact than costly suits, which it said had not
proven effective in getting people to quit smoking.[^7/42]

Advocates for the lawsuits came out swinging. They said they supported
the suits because the litigation was designed to harm cigarette
manufacturers and to try to price cigarettes out of the reach of smokers,
especially children. Dr. Michael Charney, cochairman of the Tobacco
Products Liability Project, said antismoking efforts would suffer a serious
setback if the AMA opposed liability suits. Northeastern University law
professor Richard Daynard, Charney's cochairman, speculated at the
time that the AMA Board may have opposed the lawsuits because it
needed tobacco interests as "lobbying buddies" on pet legislation, such as
a federal bill to reform malpractice laws.[^7/43]

At the AMA's December interim meeting, many delegates voiced
concerns about the board report. Dr. Richard F. Corlin, a California delegate,
said the conclusions were "a misstatement of fact" since the tobacco
liability suits seemed to be changing public policy.

However, Dr. Robert E. McAfee, an AMA trustee and one of the organization's
most outspoken critics of the tobacco industry, pushed
"across-the-board" reform of torts---from liability suits against doctors to
those against tobacco companies. He also complained that the same attorneys
who sued tobacco companies were the ones who took on physicians.
"Should \[San Francisco attorney\] Melvin Belli \[the so-called King
of Torts\] be shaping the nation's health policy?" asked McAfee, a surgeon
from South Portland, Maine, who would be AMA president-elect in
1993. Corlin replied, "When it comes to suing the tobacco industry, we
should find something nice to say about Mr. Belli."

To make peace, the AMA House watered down the final version of
the report so it essentially contained nothing controversial. Delegates deleted
the offending lines questioning the value of the tobacco liability
suits.[^7/44]

## BANNING TOBACCO ADVERTISING

While the AMA got heat on the liability issue, it generally won praise at
the same meeting for proposing a ban on cigarette advertising. Ultimately,
however, the campaign for an ad ban did not succeed as the
AMA's Washington lobbyists, in a pattern that has repeated itself many
times, provided little muscle. The AMA's failure to use its political leverage
to fight tobacco interests is legendary among antitobacco lobbyists
and congressional staffers.

The AMA Board asked the House of Delegates to support a ban on
cigarette advertising in magazines and newspapers as well as other cigarette
promotion. It was a potentially important approach to help prevent
children and adolescents from taking up smoking. Antitobacco groups
view cigarette promotion as the manufacturers' means to addict the next
generation of smokers. AMA chief Sammons contended that ad-ban
legislation and public education offered "a quicker resolution of the
tobacco problem" than would a strategy of suits against tobacco companies.

It was apparent that bringing about a tobacco-ad ban would not be
easy. The AMA might receive support from tobacco opponents, but
other powerful special interests, including publishers, the advertising industry,
and civil libertarians, would oppose a ban as a violation of constitutional
guarantees of free speech. "We have a legal product. We work
under the same Constitution as all those \[medical\] people," said the communications
director for tobacco giant Philip Morris, which held itself up
as a defender of free speech and in 1991 even purchased sponsorship of
the Bill of Rights Bicentennial. Some legal scholars said if an advertisement
was not deceptive, it should not be prohibited.

But the AMA dug in its heels. After having been criticized so often
about being weak on tobacco issues, it hoped to persuade doctors and the
public that it was a public health advocate. AMA general counsel Kirk B.
Johnson argued that an advertising ban would be upheld because cigarette
ads use deceptive themes to create an image of "good health and
youthful vigor" and because commercial speech does not have the same
legal standing as personal speech. The AMA even hired two Columbia
law professors to study the issue. Based on legal precedent, particularly a
ban of advertising for gambling aimed at local residents in Puerto Rico
that had been found constitutional, they concluded a cigarette-ad ban
could be upheld in the courts.[^7/45]

To sponsor the legislation, the AMA chose Representative Mike
Synar, a Democrat from Muskogee, Oklahoma, with a reputation for antagonizing
special interests and refusing funding from political action
committees. The AMA pledged to work in the trenches on the issue and
to have its grass-roots network of doctors pressure their federal legislators
to vote for the bill. The AMA promise of help "was very explicit,"
said a lobbyist from another health group, who had discussed the arrangements
with Synar.

The AMA helped draft the bill and testified before Congress. And to
help publicize the legislation, the AMA, in an unconventional move for
such a conservative organization, printed black-bordered"obituary postcards"
which physicians could send to federal legislators to inform them
of the death of a constituent from tobacco-caused disease and to ask
them to support the ad ban.

But in the end, AMA lobbyists essentially were a no-show. Kim
Koontz-Bayliss, Synar's former legislative aide on health, said the AMA
did not provide the sort of "scorched-earth" campaign for which she had
hoped. "I think they were very helpful, but it was not their first priority,"
she said.

Most involved agree that the AMA failed to use its clout in Congress
to get votes required to pass an ad ban. Synar's legislation never even
made it to a subcommittee vote.

## THE AMA BAILS OUT ON AN AIRCRAFT SMOKING BAN

The AMA would have made a logical ally to help push a ban on smoking
aboard aircraft through Congress. After all, in 1986, as part of its plan
for a "tobacco-free society by the year 2000" the House of Delegates endorsed
such a ban. But in 1987, when Congressman Richard J. Durbin
introduced a bill to prohibit smoking, the AMA again was absent.

When Durbin was a teen, his father died from tobacco-related disease.
After Durbin was elected to Congress in 1982, the Illinois Democrat
set out to do something to put a dent in the tobacco epidemic. A
member of the House Appropriations Transportation and Agriculture
subcommittees, Durbin decided exactly what to do after he was assigned,
against his wishes, to a smoking section on a flight from Phoenix to Chicago.
Backed by a National Academy of Sciences report about the dangers
of cigarette smoke to nonsmoking airline passengers, Durbin
dedicated himself to passing a prohibition of smoking aboard commercial
aircraft.

The congressman introduced a broad bill to ban smoking aboard
aircraft. But, facing major opposition from senior members of Congress
from tobacco states, he couldn't move the bill out of committee. Durbin
then wrote a more limited proposal to outlaw smoking only on flights
lasting two hours or less, which represented about 80 percent of domestic
flights. He wasn't optimistic, but he had a bold plan. He would do an
end run around the subcommittee and committee and introduce the ban
as part of the transportation spending bill.

Durbin's bill unexpectedly passed in July 1987 by a narrow margin.
"It was amazing. No one had really taken the tobacco lobby on with a
frontal attack like this before. They didn't take us seriously, which was
their real misfortune because we won by five votes on the floor (198--
193) ... with a very strong coalition, Republicans and Democrats,
liberal-conservative, east, west, north and south," said Durbin. The law
was a popular one and was implemented without the chaos predicted by
tobacco advocates. But it expired two years after it had passed. Legislation
adopted in 1989 made the smoking ban permanent and extended it
to about 99 percent of all commercial domestic flights.

The AMA claimed credit for the victory. The AMA in 1989 mailed
recruitment letters that boasted about its role in getting the smoking ban
on aircraft passed. This galled lobbyists from health groups active on the
bill. Durbin said the Association of Flight Attendants and the Coalition
on Smoking OR Health helped get the bill through. Durbin bluntly said
that the AMA was "not there, and there was no evidence of any strong
support for our effort from the American Medical Association."

Durbin saluted the AMA for cosponsoring legislative strategy sessions
in recent years for antismoking forces. However, he added, "I think
there's much more interest in the AMA in this debate on national health
care and how it's going to affect the delivery of health services and the
practice of medicine in America. When you start dealing with publichealth
issues, like tobacco, I don't believe that is the No. 1 item on their
agenda. I think it frankly is down the list."[^7/46]

## THE PROMOTION BAN FAILS IN THE HOUSE

The next major tobacco issue to come along was the most comprehensive
bill to fight tobacco promotion ever introduced. The AMA, which was
committed on paper to such legislation, again failed to get involved.

After the ban on smoking aboard airplanes was made permanent,
the spirits of antitobacco lobbyists were lifted. They began to feel a great
deal more might be possible. Representative Henry A. Waxman, chairman
of the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, introduced
the most sweeping antitobacco legislation to date: H.R. 5041,
the Tobacco Control and Health Protection Act. The legislation thumbed
its nose at the $3.6 billion tobacco advertising and promotion industry.
The bill would eliminate tobacco advertising and promotion as it had
been known in this country, the $2 billion orgy of images of cowboys
puffing on cigarettes in Marlboro Country, bone-thin Virginia Slims gals
and Joe Camel, the James Bond---like cartoon character used to hype
Camels, and the portraits of youthful swimmers, skiers, and other athletes
enjoying a smoke---though their cigarettes rarely are lit. The legislation
would have allowed print advertising to continue in the form of
"tombstone" ads, showing a cigarette pack against a neutral background.

The bill would have prohibited tobacco companies from promoting
athletic, musical, and artistic events, the nearly $1 billion effort to tie
smoking to popular culture and the fine arts by placing signs for cigarettes
in sports stadiums so that they are flashed on broadcasts of games,
and associating cigarette brands with leading ballet companies and art
exhibitions. In addition, the bill would have punched up warning labels
by explicitly noting, other among things, that "Cigarettes Kill," stopped
the insidious placement of cigarette products in movies and TV shows,
and required states to enforce laws against the sale of tobacco to minors.
The tobacco industry was expected to wage an all-out battle against the
advertising provisions, again claiming Constitutional violations.

### The Physician/Congressman from Tobacco Country

Waxman, who has worked closely with the AMA over the years, said he
considered the AMA an "activist" on tobacco issues because it has strong
antitobacco policies and because it has testified against tobacco before
Congress.[^7/47] But other congressional insiders insist that the AMA didn't
deliver on Waxman's bill.[^7/48] When it was clear that the vote on the Waxman
bill was going to be close, the legislation's supporters asked the AMA
to "get us" the vote of Congressman J. Roy Rowland, a close AMA ally
and a member of the subcommittee. One of only two physicians in Congress
at that time, Rowland had been effective in getting through a number
of bills on medical matters, such as AIDS, infant deaths, and rural
health. Rowland was a top recipient of donations from the AMPAC, and
he had helped grease the skids in 1991 for AMA-designed "antihassle"
legislation to reduce Medicare paperwork and regulation of doctors.
Health lobbyists hoped that Rowland would promote antitobacco legislation.
As a family physician, he had seen his patients suffer from cigaretterelated
disease. Concerned about the risks, he gave up smoking in 1967,
three years after the first Surgeon General's report. But there was one
obstacle to winning Rowland's support, and a major one at that---his voters:
the thousands of tobacco growers and the employees of the cigarette
factory in his district near Macon, Georgia.

Rowland's loyalty to his constituents rang out clearly during hearings
on H.R. 5041, in the congressman's hostile questioning of supporters of
the bill, during which he asked what they were going to do about the welfare
of the tobacco workers who would be displaced by a smoke-free
society. In an extraordinary exchange, famed cancer surgeon Dr. William
G. Cahan, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York,
turned the tables on Rowland.

>Rowland: Are you doing anything to help these people who
>may lose their jobs? Are you addressing it from
>that standpoint at all?
>
>Cahan: Mr. Rowland, I understand you are a physician. Is
>that true?
>
>Rowland: That is true.
>
>Cahan: Do you think smoking causes lung cancer?
>
>Rowland: Absolutely.
>
>Cahan: You do?
>
>Rowland: Absolutely. I am supposed to be asking the ques>tions.
Not you. ... I am concerned about the peo>ple
having jobs in the district I represent.
>
>Cahan: Are we talking in those terms? Are we concerned
>about the poor people in Colombia being laid off
>because of the lack of demand for cocaine? ...
>You and I have seen too many lives destroyed by
>this to think about necessarily getting to the ...
>point whether somebody's job is in jeopardy. ... I
>think your higher interest, the Hippocratic oath
>so-called, is to "đo no harm." As a physician to a
>physician, you and I are both trying to keep peo>ple
well and alive. That is our prime consider>ation.[^7/49]

The AMA did not bother to lobby Dr. Rowland on this bill. AMA
chief Dr. James S. Todd, a registered lobbyist, contended the AMA works
hard on tobacco issues, but views Rowland in particular as a lost cause on
this subject. "We know Rowland is rigid on \[tobacco\]. We don't waste time
on him. Why bang your head against a stone wall?" said Todd.[^7/50]

When Waxman's subcommittee voted on the proposed advertising
and promotion ban in September 1990, Rowland was involved in maneuvers
to cripple and then euthanize the legislation. First, he voted for
an amendment to remove the tombstone advertising provision. Then,
when the revised bill came up, he voted against it. The legislation made it
out of the subcommittee, but died of inaction before the full Committee
on Energy and Commerce. Strategists contended the bill might have had
a fighting chance if the AMA had leaned on Rowland and the congressman
had came out in favor of the advertising and promotion restrictions.[^7/51]

Despite his shortcomings on issues of tobacco and health, Rowland
remained an AMA favorite. The AMA in recent years has bestowed upon
those it considers to have worked for the public health the Nathan S.
Davis Awards, named for the AMA's founder and first editor of its _Journal_.
The award has gone to the likes of Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former
Surgeon General; Waxman; Senator Edward M. Kennedy; and Senator
Orrin G. Hatch, all of whom have fought against tobacco. The 1992
Davis recipients included Representative J. Roy Rowland.[^7/52]

Tobacco opponents were aghast. Clifford E. Douglas, then associate
director of government relations at the American Lung Association,
said, "Dr. Rowland has consistently championed the interests of the tobacco
industry. He has actively opposed measures designed to protect
children from tobacco addiction and even voted against legislation to
eliminate smoking on airplanes. It is hypocritical for the AMA to see fit to
honor this Member of Congress with an award recognizing his contributions
to betterment of the public health."

AMA chief executive Todd, who served on the "independent" panel
that selected Rowland, stood by the award, saying Rowland has "a defect
from the point-of-view of certain people, \[but\] on balance Roy Rowland
has been a positive force for health in Congress. To deal with one issue
only, that is a luxury the AMA doesn't have."[^7/53]

Following the Rowland affair, the message to members of Congress
was that it is possible to oppose responsible antitobacco measures the
AMA tacitly supported and still be a hero to organized medicine. As a
Davis-award recipient, Congressman Rowland has a Steuben crystal bowl
engraved with his name to prove it.

## AN ANEMIC RESPONSE IN THE SENATE

In the Senate, too, when the tobacco epidemic was being attacked, the
AMA was cited for its weak performance. Senator Edward Kennedy,
chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, introduced
the Tobacco Product Education and Health Protection Act of 1990 that
would have created a center within the Department of Health and
Human Services to regulate tobacco products, given grants to the states
for antismoking activities, and strengthened health-warning labels on
tobacco-product packages and ads. This bill was approved by Kennedy's
committee but got no further.

The AMA endorsed the legislation, and so was asked to mobilize its
grass-roots network of state medical societies to enlist cosponsors. But
when Dr. Mona Sarfaty, then senior health-policy adviser to the Senate
Committee, checked on the AMA's progress periodically, she got only "a
lot of hemming and hawing." Finally the AMA asked its state affiliates to
write letters to their senators in support of the bill. This was far less than
Sarfaty expected, since letters, if written at all, would not have the impact
of phone calls or visits. She said the AMA involvement on the bill "was
anemic, there was no follow-up, there was no direct contact. There was
no real effort to make a priority issue of it in any way, and I was very
angry."

If the AMA was anemic in this instance, it could be characterized as
comatose when Kennedy in 1991 reintroduced the Tobacco Product Education
and Health Protection Act. The revised bill would have created a
Center for Tobacco and Health in the federal Centers for Disease Control.
The agency would have promoted public education about tobacco's
dangers, conducted research on tobacco use and cessation programs,
and shared information about tobacco hazards with foreign countries,
particularly poor countries considered vulnerable to the lure of American
cigarettes. The bill would have forced cigarette makers to disclose ingredients
on cigarette packs and would have made warning labels more
hard-hitting.

This bill also took on the advertising issue in a fashion thought to be
more palatable to industry than a total ban or tombstone ads. It would
have authorized $50 million for grants for public-service announcements
and paid advertisements to discourage people from falling victim
to tobacco addiction and to persuade them to quit, especially those from
high-risk groups, such as youths, pregnant women, minorities, and bluecollar
workers.

The AMA again was asked to pitch in and again disappointed. When
it came time to plan strategy, call in chits, and wear out shoe leather, the
AMA was nowhere to be found. Douglas, then of the Coalition on Smoking
OR Health, said he helped organize three strategy sessions on Capitol
Hill of antitobacco groups, none of which the AMA attended. "An
especially diligent effort was made to get the AMA to send a representative
to attend the second strategy briefing. Several telephone calls and an
invitation sent via facsimile did not succeed, however, in getting an AMA
representative to attend the meeting or even in getting the organization
to respond to the invitation," he said.

A disillusioned Sarfaty said, "\[The AMA's\] policies, on paper, sounded
good, and they were willing to lend their name when it came to endorsement,
but when the question was whether there was really going to be
some of the lobbying that needed to be done, or even participating in
strategy sessions, anything that really would seriously advance the cause
of the bill, they were just not present and not helpful. It was very difficult
to recruit them into the effort in any meaningful way."[^7/54]

## THE DEVIL's MONEY FOR THE LORD'S WORK

By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the AMA seemed to want to become a
strong advocate against smoking. But the activists within its ranks still
had nagging doubts about its commitment to the issue.

On the positive side, the AMA was cranking out policy after policy
against tobacco. And the AMA's Chicago legislative staff in 1989 filed petitions
with federal and state agencies against a "smokeless" cigarette
being tested in two states by R. J. Reynolds. RJR ended up withdrawing
the product. The AMA, which a few years earlier wavered about a policy
of using liability suits to fight tobacco companies, surprised everyone in
1991 by submitting a brief in the Supreme Court appeal of the
Cipollone case, the highest-profile liability suit and the first in which
damages were awarded.

Despite such moves, critics still did not trust their own organization.
They felt the AMA was a paper tiger, all talk and no action on tobacco. At
the AMA meeting in December 1992, the antitobacco forces raised questions
about whether it was appropriate for the AMA to accept advertising
revenues and grants for its public health programs from nontobacco
subsidiaries, such as food companies, owned by the tobacco conglomerates.
Tobacco opponents considered this trading with the enemy.

But AMA leaders disagreed. They believed the AMA in effect was
taking the Devil's money to do the Lord's work, and told the House of
Delegates that if the AMA stopped accepting funding from tobacco subsidiaries,
the organization would lose significant revenues and would either
have to increase dues or eliminate some public health programs.
Besides, AMA honchos said, the group had no definition of what a tobacco
company was: it knew not to take money from Marlboro, but was it
wrong to accept funds from the General Foods side of Philip Morris or
RJR's Fleischmann's margarine? Activists contended that accepting
funds from any segment of these firms ought to be prohibited. The
AMA House of Delegates directed the AMA Board to come back in June
1993 with a definition of a tobacco company to help decide from whom
the AMA could ethically accept money.[^7/55]

At the same gathering, Surgeon General Antonia C. Novello, the
AMA delegate from the Public Health Service, spoke to a small group of
AMA members who had formed a coalition in 1991 in hopes of moving
the AMA from merely passing and filing resolutions to becoming true
activists on tobacco issues. After hearing coalition members' complaints
about AMA inactivity on tobacco issues, Novello summoned AMA chief
executive Todd, who was attending another session. When he appeared,
coalition leaders confronted him. Novello joined in, saying the AMA
needed to start using its clout and know-how in Washington to more aggressively
attack the tobacco epidemic.

Dr. Joel S. Dunnington, a coalition member and also a member of
the board of the activist group DOC, informed Todd: "We perceived that
the AMA didn't do much on tobacco issues. We have 11 pages of resolutions
of AMA policy on tobacco, and when you call the Washington office
they have no idea what's going on. If you look at the AMA legislative
guide, it didn't have the word tobacco in it. AMA staff in Washington
have no idea what's currently going on relating to tobacco in Congress.
Tobacco has not been a priority."[^7/56]

Such confrontations concerning tobacco between health advocates
and AMA leaders have occurred repeatedly over the past decade. But the
AMA continues to try to project the image of the organization being in
the forefront in the war on tobacco. In fact, days after President Clinton
was inaugurated in January 1993, the AMA ran an ad in the _Washington
Post_ headlined, DISEASE PREVENTION MUST BE A MAJOR PART OF HEALTH SYSTEM
REFORM: STOPPING TOBACCO DEATHS IS OUR FIRST PRIORITY. The AMA
noted it supported the idea of imposing a steep increase on the tax on
cigarettes to discourage teens from taking up smoking and to encourage
current smokers to quit. The AMA's ad informed the new Administration
that the tax increase could save millions of lives and generate billions
of dollars, which could be applied to reduce the deficit, to reform the
health-care system, and to educate the public, especially children, about
the dangers of smoking[^7/57]

At the end of the piece, the AMA listed a toll-free number through
which more information could be obtained about the AMA's reform proposals.
When Dunnington tried the number, his call rolled over to an employee
in the AMA's membership-recruitment operation. Dunnington
said the staffer knew nothing about the AMA's plans to fight tobacco.[^7/58]

### Married to the Tobacco Mob?

In June 1993 the AMA Board unveiled its definition of the tobacco
industry. Under the definition the AMA could not deal directly with tobacco
companies, but could continue to trade with the companies' subsidiaries
so long as they were not involved in the promotion of tobacco
products. [^7/59]

During a hearing of the Public Health Reference Committee, the
board's definition was attacked vehemently. Dunnington gave example
after example of how subsidiaries fought on behalf of their sister cigarette
companies. For instance, Oscar Mayer Foods Corp., a sandwichmeat
maker under the Philip Morris umbrella, lobbied against an
ordinance to make restaurants smoke-free in its headquarters city. And
Nabisco, a subsidiary of RJR, pulled $84 million in cookie accounts from
advertising giant Saatchi & Saatchi after the agency prepared a TV commercial
promoting an airline's pioneering smoke-free policy in 1989.

Dunnington told the committee: "Think of the tobacco parent corporations
as being similar to the Mafia. If the Mafia buys the local
concrete company, does that make it an honorable and legitimate organization?"
Was the AMA married to the mob? In an uncharacteristic move,
the reference committee repudiated the Board of Trustees' recommendation
and accepted the view of the critics. The committee urged delegates
to expand the definition of a tobacco company to include all
subsidiaries.

When the full House of Delegates gathered, some longtime critics of
AMA tobacco policy took the floor again to oppose the board's narrow
definition. Dr. Stuart Hanson, who had exposed AMA leaders' ownership
of a tobacco farm in 1985, urged the AMA not to be involved in the
"nicotine drug trade." Dr. Ronald Davis, who as a medical student led the
charge against tobacco in 1980, said, "These so-called diversified tobacco
companies use their non-tobacco products to support tobacco. ... If
RJR Nabisco is using Oreo cookies to support tobacco, then I do not want
our AMA to take money from Oreo cookies."

The AMA House was divided. Antitobacco advocates were on one
side. On the other were representatives of medical schools, more than
half of whom accept grants from the industry-supported Council for Tobacco
Research, and the AMA Board, which argued forcefully for continued
acceptance of subsidiary funds.[^7/60] Dr. William Stoneman III,
delegate from the Medical School Section, contended that a company
should not be penalized and put on an AMA "blacklist" simply because it
was purchased by a tobacco firm. He said to critics: "I think you're trying
to be purer than Caesar's wife on this. It doesn't make common sense."
Dr. John Ring, immediate past president of the AMA, speaking for the
board, said the association needed potential contributions from tobacco
subsidiaries to conduct its public health programs.

When the vote came, the board won. The narrow definition of a tobacco
company was adopted, allowing the organization to continue to accept
and pursue tobacco-subsidiary funding. At a press conference
afterward, AMA officials said they currently received no sponsorship
from tobacco subsidiaries and were unable to estimate how much advertising
revenue from tobacco subsidiaries was brought in by the AMA's
journals and cable television operation. AMA chief Todd promised that
the organization would be careful to evaluate subsidiaries before accepting
funds, rejecting any that promoted tobacco in any fashion. From the
tobacco opponents' viewpoint, acceptance of Oreo cookie money was tobacco
business as usual.

## A LONG WAY, BABY, BUT A LONG WAY TO GO

The AMA has come a long way from the times when it helped promote
cigarette sales and protected the tobacco industry by conducting research
on its behalf. Indeed, in recent years, the AMA has been out front
on policies to fight the tobacco epidemic.

The AMA got a boost in July 1993, when it received a one-year
$460,000 grant to organize a national office for a $10 million tobaccocontrol
program for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.[^7/61] This was
quite a contrast from 1964, when it accepted the tobacco industry's proposal
for a $10 million research program on cigarettes.

And in late March 1994, the AMA launched what it called "its largest
and most comprehensive antitobacco and stop-smoking program ever."
In its "How to Quit" program, the AMA turned to modern marketing
technology, complete with a half-hour "infomercial" and 800 numbers,
to sell a $69.95 kit with video and audio instruction to get people to break
their addiction to nicotine.

The AMA said it would use its share of royalties to fund public health
campaigns, including antismoking efforts.

But critics weren't buying the AMA's high-profile campaign. They
berated the AMA for hyping a product that had not been tested in a
rigorous scientific manner. And they pointed out that the AMA was not
using its own funds to propel the antismoking push.

Once again, the critics said, the true test of the AMA would be
whether it used its money and clout to lobby for antitobacco legislation.
And it didn't.

The AMA still has a long way to go. In some ways, nothing has
changed since 1980, when the idealistic students and resident physicians
started their antitobacco campaign within the House of Medicine. It
could be argued that in the biggest arena for national policy, the Congress,
where AMA considers itself a potent force, the doctors' group has
been preoccupied with issues it considers to be a higher priority, such as
reform of the health-care system and other physician pocketbook issues.
To keep faith with the public as well as its own members and House of
Delegates, the AMA brass needs to move tobacco to the front burner in
Washington, to put political clout behind the AMA's rhetoric.

twelve years old. "The industry deplores the politics of the release of this document by the
AMA," he said. In response, the AMA said it had intended to release the study in May, but
because of a series of unforeseen events, the final report was not released until 24 July, with
fourth-class mailing resulting in "uneven distribution"

disappointed. John K. Iglehart, reporting in "Smoking and Public Policy," _New England

some Washington quarters that although the AMA expresses support for tougher government
policies against smoking, its advocacy is less than strong, perhaps as a consequence of
its own attempt to balance the conflicting interests involved in this issue." U.S. Representative
Richard Cheney (R-Wy.), the future Secretary of Defense, told Iglehart he had worked
with the AMA on other issues, but "I don't hear from the AMA on the issue of smoking and
health ... The AMA ought to weigh in on this issue. It could do a lot to polish its own image
by expressing a professional judgment that points out more actively the dangers of smoking"
