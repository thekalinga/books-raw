# Principles for Profits: Keeping Medicine's Business Ethic Alive[^5/0]

The doctor-patient relationship
is almost sacred in American medicine. And there is a good reason for it.
Without a patient's trust, a doctor can do little good in diagnosing an illness
and prescribing a treatment. A physician can hold the trust of a patient
as long as he believes that the physician is putting him first, ahead of
interests in personal or professional gain.

The American Medical Association reveres the doctor-patient relationship
and claims that the AMA Principles of Ethics uphold that trust.
The essence of professionalism in medicine, the AMA says, is the importance
of physicians always placing patients first. The AMA, in fact, calls
itself a professional association, dedicated to the health of America, and
tries to distinguish itself from a trade group primarily interested in the
narrow economic or political interests.

But the AMA has always had a difficult time representing both its
ideals and its members. The history of the AMA shows that when its
ideals clash with its members' political and economic interests, the ideals
often lose. The founders of the AMA tried to paint a bright line separating
the profession of medicine from the business of medicine. And
during the 1950s the AMA's more high-minded members attempted to
highlight that line.

In showdowns over several highly publicized physician financial conflicts
of interest in the 1950s and 1960s, and again in the 1980s and
1990s, the AMA's members put their personal interests ahead of ethical
concerns---and their patients. Even when the leadership and the Judicial
Council attempted to steer the association toward a higher ethical plane,
its members reversed course.

## CREATING A CODE OF ETHICS

From its origins, the American Medical Association attempted to establish
a code of ethics to prevent doctors from putting their financial gain
ahead of the interests of their patients. When the AMA was started in
1847, its founders wanted to make clear that physicians were professionals,
not businessmen. This was no easy task. Unlike now, most states
then did not license doctors. With no legal distinction between a snakeoil
salesman and a doctor, it is not surprising that the public had a low
regard for physicians as a group. To improve their image, the AMA doctors
sought to distance themselves from other healers by adopting key
distinctions of the traditional European "learned professions" of law, divinity,
and medicine: a code of ethics.

The professions adopted such codes because they are in a position to
exploit the people they are supposed to help. A doctor has skills that are
difficult for non-physicians to readily evaluate. A doctor controls the
path of the patient's treatment, and it is crucial that the patient trust the
doctor for treatment to be effective. More importantly, patients---ill and
often scared---are at their most vulnerable when they see physicians.

The AMA's first Code of Ethics contains the essence of codes going
back to the beginning of medicine: physicians should put patients first.
Or, as the AMA Code put it, physicians had to have "a sense of ethical
obligations rising superior ... to considerations of personal advancement."
The code rejected the business practices of many doctors at the
time. It declared that advertising by doctors was "highly reprehensible"
and "derogatory to the dignity of the profession." And it sought to limit
doctors' incomes basically to fees for the services they provided. The
code barred doctors from profiting from patents on surgical instruments
and medicine.[^5/1]

In 1903 the AMA replaced the Code of Ethics with the Principles of
Ethics. The organization changed the name from "Code" to "Principles"
to emphasize that ethics are not enforceable laws or a penal code, but
standards of conduct. The 1903 Principles echoed many of the words
and sentiments of the 1847 Code, but broke the Code's image as an almost
sacred icon.

### Bodies for Sale

Among the issues addressed by the 1903 Principles was a nettlesome
practice among doctors: fee-splitting. Fee-splitting did not begin until
the 1890s and did not become widespread until the 1900s. This practice
involved a kickback paid by a doctor---often a surgeon---to another doctor---frequently
a general practitioner---for referring patients.[^5/2] At first
the AMA's House of Delegates did not entirely ban fee-splitting. Instead,
it voted to kick out only those members proven guilty of fee-splitting
"without the full knowledge of the patient." In other words, it was okay
for a surgeon to give a kickback to a referring doctor as long as the doctor
told the patient about it.[^5/3]

In 1912 the House of Delegates reaffirmed its prohibition of "secret
fee-splitting." A report explained the motivations behind the practice:
surgeons' incomes had soared while general practitioners' earnings
remained static. Meanwhile, the delegates added a ban on doctors accepting
commissions or rebates from instrument manufacturers or
medical-supply houses. This practice appeared to border on bribery
since the doctors' decisions to recommend a particular brand of glasses
or drug was influenced by a manufacturer's payment of money.

In 1913 surgeons organized themselves into the American College
of Surgeons, a group of physicians independent of the AMA. The surgeons
attempted to stamp out fee-splitting---after all, it was not in their
economic interest to pay kickbacks. Members of the ACS had to sign an
oath vowing to shun "dishonest money-seeking" and to "refuse utterly all
secret money trades with consultants and practitioners."[^5/4]

Finally, in 1929, the House of Delegates equated fee-splitting with
commissions, and deemed both unethical. Doctors, however, continued
to engage in the condemned practice. In the early 1950s the ACS conducted
a crusade against fee-splitting. Dr. Paul Hawley, an ACS director,
made headlines and outraged the AMA in an interview with _U.S. News &
World Report_. He said fee-splitting was rampant among doctors and led to
"ghost" surgery---that is, procedures in which patients were not informed
about or were misled about the identity of the operating surgeon---and
unnecessary procedures. Meanwhile, Dr. Loyal Davis, another prominent
ACS member and stepfather of future First Lady Nancy Davis
Reagan, also publicly condemned fee-splitting. [^5/5]

AMA delegates responded to Hawley's highly publicized interview
by introducing nearly a dozen resolutions condemning his remarks as
damaging to the profession. Some of the resolutions even suggested censorship.
The Chicago Medical Society attempted to discipline him for
speaking out against fee-splitting without the medical society's permission.
The practice never disappeared, but the AMA succeeded in lowering
its high profile. The AMA in 1954 adopted a resolution calling for "a
moratorium from the constant discussion of 'principles'about fees."

## THE TEMPTATIONS OF WEALTH

After World War II the world of medicine underwent a major transformation,
tempting doctors with new ways to make money off their patients.
New technology advanced medicine, making it more effective in
treating illness. New drugs came on the market in rapid succession.
Federal money financed the construction of newer, better hospitals. And
the explosion of private health insurance among workers through union
contracts or in individual purchases pumped money into the health-care
system. In the post-war era, medicine prospered.

Doctors prospered as well. With the influx of money and patients,
there simply were not enough doctors to go around, so it was relatively
easy for them to build practices. Doctors' lucrative practices gave them
money to invest, and they began eyeing side medical businesses. These
entrepreneurs sought the blessing of the Judicial Council, which serves
as the AMA's "Supreme Court," and that set off an internal battle within
the AMA over the ethics of making money.

The entrepreneurial doctors pushed for a fundamental change in
the AMA's Principles of Ethics. But they met stiff resistance from the
more conservative M.D.s on the Judicial Council. The question was
whether doctors could engage in side businesses as a way to make money
from their patients. The outcome of the battle would shape the direction
of medicine and the AMA for decades.

In 1947, noting the dozens of proposals from entrepreneurial doctors,
the Judicial Council reported with a weariness of voice: "It should
be well known by this time that the traditional interpretation of the Principles
of Medical Ethics ... is that the doctor may receive no profit
whatever from his patient other than payment for rendered medical services."[^5/6]

In 1949 the Judicial Council persuaded the AMA's House to make
the traditional interpretation explicit in the Principles. The new section
stated: "An ethical physician does not engage in barter or trade in the
appliances, devices or remedies prescribed for patients, but limits
sources of his professional income to professional services rendered the
patient."[^5/7]

However, this was not a universally popular move. Dr. Allen T. Stewart
of Texas assailed the "restrictive infringement" of the revised ethics,
and asserted that the federal government was using the revision as "an
entering wedge" to deprive doctors of their constitutional rights to engage
in private enterprise. Stewart sought to loosen the restrictions at the
AMA's next meeting in 1950, but failed.[^5/8]

The arguments over physicians' side businesses surfaced in the popular
press, tarnishing the image of M.D.s. Dr. Edwin B. Dunphy, the
chairman of the AMA's section on ophthalmology, tackled this image
problem in his annual address in June 1952. He noted that many politicians
and citizens attacked the AMA as a group of "greedy" doctors, and
warned, "The medical profession is not a luxury business but a profession
dedicated to rendering service to humanity. Reward or financial
gain is a subordinate consideration. Physicians should never lose sight of
this principle. If they do, the medical profession will certainly be government
regulated eventually and with public approval."[^5/9]

### The Lure of Drugs

Of the growing number of opportunities for doctor investments, pharmacies
and pharmaceutical companies proved to be among the most
profitable and tempting. A watershed battle within the AMA was fought
over the ethics of these investments. Pharmacies seemed a logical extension
of the services offered by doctors and group practices. Doctors knew
something about the drugs they prescribed. And many group practices,
patterned after the well-known Mayo Clinic, already offered a range of
doctors and services, such as blood tests and X rays.

Retail drugstores and pharmaceutical manufacturers were enjoying
a postwar boom. The sales at retail drugstores grew steadily, and rose to a
record $4.5 billion in the mid-1950s.[^5/10] In 1954 the Judicial Council
urged the House to ban physician ownership of drugstores, or doctor
dispensing of drugs, unless no other drugstore was available. The House
complied. Under the revision, doctors who wished to own a pharmacy, or
dispense drugs or other devices such as glasses, had to get a waiver from
the local medical society stating no other adequate suppliers existed
nearby. Even then, doctors were required to make the drugs or devices
available "without profit."[^5/11]

The revision created an uproar. Angry delegates came to the AMA's
annual meeting in June 1955, determined to force a showdown. The
fight pitted entrepreneurial doctors against the high-minded Judicial
Council. The entrepreneurs launched ten resolutions proposing the repeal
or at least the loosening of the Principles. One resolution claimed
the physicians' right to dispense drugs to their patients dated back to
Hippocrates; another traced it to Socrates. Others asserted physicians
had a constitutional right to make money. Another said the revision indicated
AMA leaders lacked faith in the medical profession's integrity while
denying doctors "the right to a fair and reasonable profit in the providing
of remedies to the patient."

The entrepreneurs won. A committee fashioned a compromise,
which the House adopted. The new principle said: "It is not unethical for
a physician to prescribe or supply drugs, remedies, or appliances as long
as there is no exploitation of the patient."[^5/12]

### Selling the Birthright

The House action overturned an ethical precept long held by the Judicial
Council. The council had always insisted that doctors should not even be
in a position to financially exploit their patients by making money on the
drugs or devices they prescribed. But now the House had set a different
standard. The new standard distinguished the opportunity to exploit
from the act of exploitation itself.

The rebuff of a key ethical precept deeply disturbed the chairman
of the Judicial Council, Dr. Homer L. Pearson. In an anguished report
Pearson accused the delegates of selling out the AMA's ethics for personal
financial gain. Turning to the Bible, Pearson recalled the story of
Esau, who sold his birthright for a bowl of pottage. In Pearson's sermon,
doctors became Esau, the AMA's Principles of Ethics became their birthright,
and financial temptations became the pottage. He wrote, "Birthrights
are very hard to come by, but their selling price is sometimes very
cheap---sometimes the price of meatless stew."[^5/13]

Meanwhile, in 1957, the House of Delegates adopted a new, streamlined
version of the Principles of Ethics. The House reduced its principles
to ten sections, with much of the flowery language excised. The first
section said service to humanity is the "principal objective of the medical
profession," but no longer stated that reward or financial gain was subordinate.
Instead, the Principles encouraged doctors to "merit the confidence
of patients."

Another section seemed to limit the source of physician income. It
said: "In the practice of medicine a physician should limit the source of
his professional income to medical services actually rendered by him, or
under his supervision, to his patients." But the Principles now included a
loophole: "Drugs, remedies or appliances may be dispensed or supplied
by the physician provided it is in the best interests of the patients." [^5/14]

### Income Over Image

The Judicial Council did not rest in its struggle with the physicianentrepreneurs.
In 1961 Dr. George Woodhouse, the new chairman of
the Judicial Council, picked up where Pearson had left off. The council
conducted a year-long study of the pharmacy-ownership issue, and issued
its report to the AMA's interim meeting in November 1962. The report
took the hard line, proposing again a ban on doctors' making money
off their patients by selling drugs or devices. It also branded as unethical
doctor ownership of drug-repackaging companies---businesses that
took drugs, put them in new packages under a brand name, and then
sold them---and controlling interest in pharmaceutical companies. The
council's report stated bluntly: "These practices are contrary to the best
interest of the public and the medical profession. Any arrangement by
which the physician profits from the remedy he prescribes or supplies is
unethical."[^5/15]

But the report was met with hostility at an AMA hearing. Speaking
against the proposal were many physicians who owned drugstores or
drug firms, ophthalmologists, and the association that represented clinic
managers and owners, many of whom also owned pharmacies.

Only three physicians spoke in favor of the proposal. James H. Sammons,
a Texas delegate and future AMA chief executive, was one of
them. He was particularly vexed about the image of doctors, given the
impending fight with the Kennedy administration over its proposal for
Medicare. The Texas Medical Association deemed physician ownership
of drugstores and pharmaceutical companies unethical, in part because
of the temptations inherent in the arrangements. In speeches on the issue,
Sammons stressed that he did not seek to limit physician income,
"for most assuredly we do not want to do that." Instead, the issue was
about the AMA's image.

"We feel very strongly that physician ownership of drugstores is adversely
affecting medicine in the public eye. It is difficult, if not impossible,
to discuss intelligently and convincingly the problems of the socialization
and governmentalization of medicine with a patient who knows
that the doctor or doctors in town own the drugstores from which he or
they are buying their medications. This in the public eye becomes unequivocally
greed of the worst sort," Sammons said in a 1962 speech.[^5/16]

But the reference committee did not heed the warnings of Woodhouse
or Sammons. Instead, it seized on a procedural issue---the Judicial
Council had not published its report in the _AMA Journal_ early enough---and killed the proposal. The council did not again attempt to restore the
1954 Principles, or anything similar, until 1991.

## NEW TIMES, NEW PRINCIPLES

On July 22, 1980, the House of Delegates adopted a new looser and simpler
version of the Principles of Ethics after little debate. The new Principles
had been crafted and sold over a three-year period by a committee
led by Dr. James S. Todd, the New Jersey surgeon who would a decade
later become head of the AMA. In reality, the AMA had no choice but to
change the code. Legally, its back was to the wall for two reasons.

First, chiropractors had filed a barrage of lawsuits against the AMA,
accusing it of conspiring to prevent them from practicing medicine. In
the lawsuits a key exhibit was the AMA's Principles, which said a physician
shouldn't voluntarily associate with anyone whose approach was not
based on science. The lawsuits said the AMA used this language to bar
chiropractors from getting physician referrals and hospital privileges.

And the Federal Trade Commission also dogged the AMA. The FTC
accused the AMA of restraining free trade by banning physician advertising
and interfering with certain types of medical practice, such as
health-maintenance organizations. After the FTC made its ruling, the
AMA sued. Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 4--4 vote in 1982,
upheld the FTC. The FTC also cited the AMA's Principles as key evidence.

As a result, the 1980 version of the Principles surgically removed the
offending sections and replaced them with more amenable language.
The AMA dropped the ban on associating with unscientific healers and
its limits on types of medical practice. The AMA also clipped language
banning physician advertising. AMA lawyers stressed the revision in the
legal battles with the chiropractors and the FTC. Todd denied the revision
was simply a reaction to the lawsuits facing the AMA, though he acknowledged
the association needed to meet certain legal requirements. [^5/17]

But the AMA's leaders understood the potential danger of the
changes facing the AMA. Among them was Dr. James Sammons, who in
1974 became the AMA's chief executive. At the 1980 meeting at which
the House adopted the new Principles, Sammons said, "What worries me
is a growing threat to professionalism itself." He said one problem with
professionalism was that it had no single agreed-upon definition, but he
listed three elements: ethical standards, competence, and the scientific
method. "When you consider what has emerged from both the legislative
and executive branches of government in recent times," he said, "you
can see clear threats to all three of those elements that characterize a
profession."[^5/18]

### The Corporate Challenge

Ironically, as the 1980s developed, the greatest danger to professionalism
came not from government but from the private sector as corporations
and even doctors themselves became entrepreneurs out to make a
buck on technology that became a driving force in medicine. The
Reagan administration aided and abetted the capitalistic spirit---pushing
marketplace competition as the new path for medicine. Under this approach,
doctors become health-care providers, and patients customers.

Dr. Arnold S. Relman, the editor of the _New England Journal of Medicine_,
took note of the trend and reacted with alarm. He staked out his
position against the growth of commercialism in medicine in an editorial,
"The New Medical-Industrial Complex." He decried the rise of
the for-profit businesses in a field that in recent history had been primarily
not-for-profit. Relman urged the AMA to take the lead. The AMA
must keep doctors on the straight and narrow path of professionalism,
no matter what the pressures might be, Relman said.

He wrote, "If the AMA took a strong stand against any financial interest
of physicians in health-care businesses, it might risk an anti-trust
suit. ... Yet, I believe that the risk to the reputation and self-esteem of
the profession will be much greater if organized medicine fails to act decisively
in separating physicians from the commercial exploitation of
health care. ... A refusal to confront this issue undermines the moral
position of the profession and weakens the authority with which it can
claim to speak for the public interest."[^5/19]

Relman recalled in an interview years later that after his editorial ran
he had gotten no direct response from the AMA. But as he continued his
crusade he began to annoy the AMA. "Many of the editorials that I wrote
were critical of the policies that were being supported by organized medicine,"
he said. "I heard indirectly from many sources that there was unhappiness
in the AMA."

### The AMA Way

The AMA again was confronted with an explosion of technology that
created many tempting, lucrative investment opportunities for doctors.
And it continued to face the question that had been so nettlesome in the
1950s: should doctors be allowed to make a profit off their patients
through side businesses that supplied or provided the cure or therapy
the doctors recommended?

For its answer, the AMA resorted to its ambivalent past. At the interim
meeting in December 1984, the House adopted conflict-of-interest
guidelines proposed by the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs [^5/20]
Over the next two years, the report would be refined and debated. But
primarily the AMA decided it was acceptable for physicians to profit on
their patients' treatments.

The final report noted that physicians, like all professionals, face a
conflict of interest pitting the physician's financial self-interest against
the interests of the patient. The way to resolve that, the AMA had decided,
was not to return to its high-minded policy that said doctors
should make money only from fees. Rather, the AMA in the mid-1980s
echoed the past by decreeing: "Physician ownership in a commercial
venture with the potential for abuse is not in itself unethical."[^5/21] The way
to deal with the conflict of interest that arises from owning a commercial
venture is through disclosure, the council said. This position recalled the
AMA's first response to fee-splitting at the turn of the century---the practice
was okay as long as the doctor disclosed it.

The AMA added that doctors should not exploit patients by requiring
unnecessary services such as tests or X rays, that doctors should not
break the law, and that patients should be allowed to use facilities other
than the ones owned by the doctors. And the guidelines added, "When a
physician's commercial interest conflicts so greatly with the patient's interest
as to be incompatible, the physician should make alternative arrangements
for the care of the patient."[^5/22]

At the _New England Journal of Medicine_, Relman saw encouraging
signs in the new guidelines, but he again goaded the AMA to take a
stronger stand. To declare once again that the patient comes first is good,
he said, but it is not enough. In a _Journal_ editorial, Relman wrote, "The
AMA's present position has an even more troublesome aspect. In admitting
that business deals create conflicts of interest for physicians, but
arguing that we need be concerned only about arrangements that demonstrably
lead to bad practice, the AMA's statement ignores the
damage done to the public trust in the medical profession by even the
_appearance_ of conflicts of interest. That, after all, is a major problem with
conflicts of interest." Relman held up as exemplary the statement
adopted by the association of internal-medicine specialists, The American
College of Physicians, which Relman called a firm and unequivocal
statement. The ACP position stated: "The physician must avoid any personal
commercial conflict of interest that might compromise his loyalty
and treatment of the patient."[^5/23]

The AMA responded through Dr. James Todd, who in 1985 had become
second-in-command. He fired off an angry letter to Relman. "You
are not the first to address this issue," Todd snapped. He said the AMA
had repeatedly declared that it is unethical for doctors to put their own
interests ahead of the interests of their patients.

"The AMA is working within time-honored ethical guidelines and
does not believe that physicians ... should be prohibited from making
investments in, or participating in the ownership of facilities that function
within the medical and health-care fields," Todd wrote. "Such a
restrictive policy would impose unnecessary and unfair economic discrimination
against members of a respected and respectable profession."

Relman tartly replied that a stronger stand against commercialism
would "be a beacon to guide" doctors who were confused about the issue
and would bolster the public's esteem for the medical profession. He
added ominously: "If we \[doctors\] insist on exercising our right to invest
in health-care facilities, the government and the public will inevitably treat
us like commercial vendors rather than independent professionals."[^5/24]

### Hooked on Drugs[^5/25]

The first big test for the AMA's new policy on conflicts of interest came in
1985 as delegates were putting the final touches on the guidelines. A
survey of state pharmacy boards by _American Druggist_ that year had discerned
a new trend. Increasingly doctors, medical groups, and ambulatory-care
centers were selling their patients prescription drugs. That
meant a doctor would prescribe a drug for the patients treatment and
then turn around and sell that drug to the patient. Most doctors write a
prescription and tell their patients to take it to a drugstore, where a pharmacist
fills the prescription and sells it to the patient. Doctor drugdispensing
ends that arrangement.

Physician dispensing was not new. A quarter of doctors dispensed
drugs in 1947; by 1967, with the proliferation of drugstores, only a tenth
did.[^5/26] Most doctors who dispense drugs said they do it for the convenience
of their patients. They cite elderly patients and the parents of
small children needing treatment---for them a trip to a drugstore could
be an ordeal. Dispensing doctors also say patients benefit because they
are more likely to fill the prescription if they buy the drugs at the same
time the doctor gives them a prescription.

But opponents point to the other incentive for dispensing drugs:
selling prescription drugs boosts doctors' earnings. That proved to be a
powerful lure during the 1980s, when doctors worried about their incomes
in the face of a greater push for controlling medical costs and
increased competition among physicians. The danger inherent in physician
dispensing is that a doctor might prescribe too many drugs to a patient,
or prescribe drugs he or she had in stock even if another drug
might be better.

The renewed interest during the 1980s in selling prescription drugs
was inspired by several aggressive drug-repackaging firms. These companies
bought drugs in bulk from pharmaceutical manufacturers and
then resold them to doctors in convenient packages. For example, Doctors'
Pharmacy, a St. Louis repackaging company, offered deals for a twoweek
supply of medicine for six different practices, such as ambulatory
care and pediatrics. The Ambulatory Care package included twenty-two
drugs at cost to a doctor of $1,537. Doctors who bought into the deal decided
what to charge patients for dispensing the drugs, as well as the
markup on the drugs themselves. The firm's brochure simply said, "Doctors'
Pharmacy will increase the profitability of your practice."

But other sales pitches were more direct. One promised that "dispensing
drugs offers a proven source of new revenue. Typically, about
15% additional net income." Another said, "A practice dispensing about
250 Rx \[prescriptions\] per week at $3.00 per Rx dispensing fee would
earn $39,000 a year. At $4.00 per Rx dispensing fee, 250 Rx per week
would yield $52,000 incremental profit." And the most direct said, "Each
script \[prescription\] you write is like a check to the pharmacy; why not
write that check to your practice instead?"[^5/27]

### Competing Interests

Pharmacists immediately saw the threat to their own well-being. If doctors
sell prescription drugs, who needs pharmacists? The National Association
of Retail Druggists (NARD), a trade group representing 30,000
independent pharmacists, sprang into action. John M. Rector, general
counsel and chief lobbyist for NARD, recalled that his group met with
the AMA during the summer of 1986 to discuss doctor dispensing. As a
starting point, Rector said, he reminded Sammons of his opposition
to physician ownership of drugstores and drug companies back in the
1960s.

"He was impressed we had done our research," Rector said. "It was
obvious he was at a different place. I don't know that he had changed his
view, but he had a different job. As a matter of fact, he did agree to a joint
agreement that doctors should be doctors and pharmacists should be
pharmacists."

In December 1986 the AMA's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs
issued an update on the conflict-of-interest policy, and addressed doctor
drug-dispensing. "Although there are circumstances in which physicians
may ethically engage in the dispensing of drugs ... physicians are
urged to avoid regular dispensing and retail sale of drugs ... when the
needs of patients can be met adequately at local ethical pharmacies," the
report said. In February 1987 the AMA again publicly backed the doctorpharmacist
system in a statement with NARD and the National Association
of Chain Drug Stores [^5/28]

As the drug-dispensing issue heated up, several state legislatures began
examining the issue. But the Reagan administration's Federal Trade
Commission said doctor dispensing provided competition for drugstores
and pharmacists, and deemed moves to limit the practice anticompetitive.
In November 1986 the FTC sent a letter to the Georgia State Board
of Pharmacy, opposing its proposed rules that would restrict physician
dispensing. In the next month the FTC issued a similar letter to the Maryland
State Board of Medical Examiners. The FTC's message was clear:
state moves to limit doctor dispensing might invite FTC antitrust action.

Representative Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) tried to take on the FTC by attaching
an amendment that would prohibit doctors from dispensing for
profit to another bill. But a congressional committee rejected the amendment.
The AMA took credit for its defeat, saying it had vigorously
opposed the amendment. [^5/29] The day after the amendment lost in committee,
Wyden introduced a bill to ban doctor dispensing. His bill was
brief and to the point. It said physicians could not dispense drugs for a
profit except in certain cases. Those exceptions included the giving of
shots and vaccines, emergencies when the nearest pharmacy was fifteen
miles or more away, and rural or Indian clinics. The bill, of course, had
the full backing of Rector and NARD, but not the AMA.

"Sammons always felt like we had picked his pocket," Rector recalled.
Although the AMA had entered into an agreement with the druggists
and the chain drugstores to in part head off any legislation on the federal
level, Sammons felt he and the AMA had been taken advantage of,"
Rector said. "Here was Wyden coming up with a bill based on our
agreement."

At a hearing on the bill, Dr. Nancy W. Dickey, chair of the AMA's
Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, testified that the AMA discouraged
doctor dispensing, but nevertheless opposed the bill. She said there
was no proof that a federal law was needed because of widespread problems.
An estimated 5 percent of the doctors dispensed. Besides, regulation
of doctors properly belonged to the states, she said.[^5/30] The Energy
and Commerce Committee supported the bill but it never passed Congress.

### Saying Yes to Drugs

The battle was not over. At the AMA's annual meeting in June 1987,
some delegates took umbrage at the AMA position on drug dispensing,
and introduced two resolutions asserting a physician's right to dispense
drugs. About twenty-one physicians rose to speak on the question at the
AMA's reference committee hearing, and they all supported drug dispensing.
Dr. Whitney G. Sampson, an ophthalmologist, said, "I would say
that the AMA needs an attitudinal adjustment, because up until now it
has been reluctantly tolerant rather than supportive of dispensing."

The AMA delegates with little other debate had reversed the AMA's
position on an ethical issue favored by the AMA's leaders and Judicial
Council. Instead of the principled stand discouraging drug dispensing,
the delegates took the opposite tack. To replace the offending language
adopted just six months earlier, the delegates approved the following
language: "The American Medical Association supports the physician's
right to dispense drugs and devices when it is in the best interest of the
patient and consistent with the AMA's established ethical guidelines."[^5/31]
Of course, the language left doctors in charge of deciding just exactly
what is the patient's best interest.

Meanwhile, Relman's thinking on controlling conflicts of interest
had undergone an evolution. At the beginning of the 1980s, Relman had
put his faith in the ability of the ethical codes of the major doctor organizations,
and especially of the AMA, to protect the professional status of
physicians. Now he believed the AMA and others could not do it alone.[^5/32]

The AMA, in particular, seemed to be having a difficult time sticking
to a consistent position. And the medical association faced a confused
approach by government, whose different branches often pushed in different
directions. So now Relman still urged the AMA and other associations
to hold up high ethical principles for all to see. But, Relman
decided, physicians needed the protection of the law.

In a tone far different from that arguments heard on the floor at the
AMA meeting, he concluded: "Trust in one's physician is an essential but
fragile ingredient of good medical care. It may not withstand the conversion
of physicians into vendors of drugs for profit."[^5/33]

## PROFITABLE SELF-DEALING

The rapid development of medical technology in the 1980s not only
saved lives, but it also enriched those who owned it. An array of high-tech
devices appeared, from easier-to-use equipment in doctors' clinical labs
to more exotic apparatuses, such as magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI)
scanners. And, like the pharmaceuticals and drugstores of the 1950s,
they proved to be tempting investments for doctors with money to spare
and a knowledge of the use of the high-tech machines.

In March 1989 Representative Fortney "Pete" Stark, a liberal Democrat
from Oakland and chairman of the health subcommittee of the
Ways and Means Committee, held a hearing on legislation aimed at banning
Medicare payments to doctors from referring patients to facilities
they owned. He quoted a _Wall Street Journal_ article that had just appeared.

The article cited a Michigan Blue Cross and Blue Shield survey of
forty diagnostic laboratories---twenty owned by doctors who referred patients
to them and twenty owned by nonphysicians. At the doctor-owned
labs, the average payment was $45 and the average number of tests per
patient was 6.23. At the other labs, the average cost was $25 and average
number of tests per patient 3.76. The conclusion was that physician
ownership leads to more testing.

The article also described how in New Jersey the twenty-six doctors
who invested in an MRI imaging center appeared to have struck it rich.
Each partnership share cost $25,000 in 1986. By June 1988 a financial
report showed a six-month return of nearly $10,000. The venture's prospectus
projected that the annual return by 1995 would be about $35,000
per share and that ten years after initial investment total profits would be
nearly $250,000.

And it mentioned how one consultant based in Southern California
boasted that the seventy MRI centers he had helped set up with physician
investors averaged 400 scans a month and more than $1 million in pretax
profits. The national average for such centers, he said, was about 260
scans a month and pretax profits of $400,000. The key to success was
involving the physicians who refer patients. As he put it, "Greed is a
powerful motivator."[^5/34]

In his opening remarks, Stark said, "All partnerships, no matter how
well-intentioned, involve a serious conflict of interest that threatens the
doctor-patient relationship and poses a risk of overutilization, substandard
care, and unfair competition. Patients are anxious about their
health and bewildered by the complexities of modern health care. They
need to trust someone. ... It's difficult for patients to second-guess their
physicians. And, physicians, through self-dealing arrangements, should
not put their patients in the position where they are forced to question
their doctor's advice and loyalty."

Laws already existed to handle the most egregious kinds of kickbacks.
Congress had first passed a Medicare antifraud law in 1972, which
prohibited rebates and kickbacks for patients or business paid for by
Medicare or Medicaid. In 1977 Congress strengthened the law by outlawing
any "remuneration," direct or indirect, for referrals of patients or
business under Medicare or Medicaid. The law also stiffened penalties,
raising them from misdemeanors to felonies, upping the maximum jail
terms from one to five years, and hiking top fines from $10,000 to
$25,000. In 1980 Congress required prosecutors to prove the accused's
intent, that is, he "knowingly and willingly" broke the law. And in 1987,
Congress added a "professional death sentence" by allowing the Inspector
General of the Department of Health and Human Services to bar
guilty doctors and other providers from Medicare.

To help doctors, though, this law required the Inspector General to
describe in federal regulations what financial arrangements---called
"safe harbors"---would not be prosecuted. But these guidelines did not
appear for comment until January 1989 and were not finally implemented
until 1991. Meanwhile, some lawyers for doctors complained the
safe-harbor regulations did little to clear up the murky waters. Stark complained
many of the financial arrangements in self-referral schemes
had found a loophole in the federal antikickback laws. "What is needed
is what lawyers call a 'bright line' rule to give providers and physicians
unequivocal guidance as to the types of arrangements that are prohibited,"
Stark said. "If the law is clear and the penalties are substantial,
we can rely on self-enforcement. Few physicians will knowingly break
the law."[^5/35]

### AMA's Contradictory Stand

The AMA had staked out its position. It was not necessarily unethical to
own and refer patients to a facility, the AMA said. But to avoid crossing
the line into unethical practice, the doctor had to follow five guidelines.
Among them was a requirement not to break any state laws regarding
self-referrals. The AMA's reliance on state law confused some representatives
at Stark's hearing on the issue.

Relman testified first at the hearing. His appearance marked the final
step in his ultimate disillusionment about the power of organized
medicine to protect itself and its values against commercialism. Relman
came out for Stark's law, and he explained why to a committee: "The
basic purpose of the bill is sound. It meets the basic principles of medical
ethics and it is clearly in the public interest."

Representative Jim Moody (D-Wis.) seemed puzzled about the AMA's
position. On the one hand, he said, the AMA wanted no more federal
laws defining ethical behavior---that should be left up to organized medicine.
On the other hand, the AMA said if self-referrals were legal, they
must be ethical. That, to Moody, seemed contradictory.

Moody asked Relman if he believed that the internal ethical procedures
of organized medicine would eventually rule self-referrals out-ofbounds
of ethical behavior. Relman replied, "I would like to think so,
because I think the logic is inexorable." Moody pressed, "But you do not
have the confidence that the profession itself will arrive there in a timely
fashion?" Relman answered, "Correct."[^5/36]

Dr. James S. Todd, the senior executive vice president of the AMA,
downplayed the problem in his testimony. He said an AMA survey found
that fewer than 10 percent of doctors had an ownership interest in
health-care facilities beyond their own practices, and only about 7 percent
of the doctors in this country referred patients to facilities in which
they had an ownership interest. Todd also cited cases where physician
investment in the facilities was good for patients, and he derided the evidence
against doctor-owned facilities as anecdotal. "Legislation by anecdote
is dangerous," he said.

Noting that both the Inspector General's office and the Government
Accounting Office had studies due to be completed in two months, Todd
argued that Congress should wait to see them before enacting a law. "It
may well be that legislation in this area will be required, but at a time
when the evidence is anecdotal," Todd said, "we believe any further legislation
addressing a perceived problem is premature and probably overreaching."

He concluded that depending on the facts, "it could well be that a
rifle shot" could hit the inappropriate practices, rather than the "shotgun
approach" of Stark's proposed law.[^5/37]

Representative Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.) asked Todd if the studies
came back with results showing abuse in terins of substantial increase in
referrals by physicians to facilities owned by them, would the AMA back a
law containing a more generic approach than the "rifle shots" he suggested.

Todd replied, "If there are abuses and exploitation identified that
cannot be handled by a rifleshot approach, of course we will support a
more generic legislation because the profession does not want to allow
these activities to continue if they truly are not in the best interests of
patients."[^5/38]

### The Rifle Shot

On April 28, 1989, Inspector General Richard P. Kusserow released his
study. Based on surveys of 4,000 Medicare providers and 1,100 labs, the
study found a more widespread pattern than the AMA had of physician
ownership of facilities, particularly independent labs, those not in doctors'
offices. Kusserow's survey found that 12 percent of doctors who
billed Medicare had ownership or investment interests in the facilities to
which they referred their patients. And the study found that 8 percent of
physicians billing Medicare had compensation arrangements with entities
to which they referred. The report also found that referring physicians
owned in whole or in part about a quarter of independent clinical
and physiological laboratories. Finally, the study found that patients of
referring physicians who had an interest or ownership of labs received 45
percent more lab services than Medicare patients in general. And the increased
use of the labs cost Medicare $28 million in 1987.[^5/39]

Responding to the study, Stark said, "Medicare patients, and the taxpayer,
are paying tens of millions of dollars for needless tests caused by
doctors referring patients to centers from which the doctor makes a
profit because of the referral." Todd, however, presented a different interpretation,
saying, "The Inspector General has shown nothing, other
than by inference, to indicate inappropriate utilization." He cited the report
finding that patients of self-referring doctors received 45 percent
more lab services than the average Medicare patient. "That can be interpreted
in two ways," he said. "The media interpret it as being bad. You
could also interpret it as indicating there are a lot of Medicare beneficiaries
out there who are not getting enough testing."[^5/40]

Next, in June 1989, the GAO released preliminary results of its indepth
study of facilities in Maryland and Pennsylvania. In both states,
physician ownership of labs and imaging centers was relatively recent:
about four-fifths of the facilities in Maryland and two-thirds in Pennsylvania
had begun in the past four years. As for the actual experience, the
GAO found that in Maryland, physician-owners of laboratories tended
to order about twice as many tests as doctors who did not own labs, as well
as the most costly services. For imaging services, physician-owners ordered
slightly fewer tests, but they tended to be much more costly, the
GAO study found.[^5/41]

But the AMA refused to believe that self-referral was a problem. Ata
hearing in June 1989 held by Representative Henry A. Waxman (DCalif.)
on Stark's self-referral bill, Todd repeated many of the statements
he had made three months earlier to Stark's hearing. He listened as the
studies of the Inspector General and the GAO were discussed. Then he
said, "Studies as you have just heard have shown us the demography of
the situation but without convincing conclusions. Anecdotes support
multiple conclusions."[^5/42]

The AMA was not alone in its stance. Joining it were the American
Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Neurology,
and the American College of Rheumatology. But it found itself opposed
by other medical groups, most notably the American College of Surgeons
and the Institute of Medicine. The report of the latter on the
effects of for-profit medicine on the quality of health care was widely
quoted. "It should be regarded as unethical and unacceptable for physicians
to have ownership interests in health-care facilities to which
they make referrals or receive payments for making referrals," the institute
said.

In the end, the AMA won a partial victory when a legislative compromise
resulted in a watered-down version of Stark's bill. The House had
passed a version of Stark's bill, but the Senate had held no hearings, nor
did it pass any version of the legislation. To complicate matters, the bill
was handled in the budget-reconciliation process, which meant that its
fate was decided by the same conferees and at the same time as the massive
revamp of physician payment under Medicare was hashed out in onagain,
off-again style.

In December 1989 President George Bush signed the bill into law. As
weak as the legislation was, it was the first federal law that deemed selfreferrals
a version of fee-splitting or kickbacks. Inspector General
Kusserow described self-referrals as "business practices where the ultimate
objective may be the same \[as a kickback\] but where the payments
are masked as 'dividends,' 'rent,' or 'consulting fees.'" The law also laid
the groundwork for a broader ban on self-referrals by inspiring a series
of studies to figure out how many doctors had bought into the scheme.

## CONFLICTING REPORTS ON SELF-REFERRALS

After passage of the Stark bill, the debate over how many doctors engaged
in the practice of self-referral continued. In June 1991 the AMA
released a study that found the practice was still not widespread, and was
in fact declining. In a survey of about 4,000 doctors, the AMA's Center
for Health Policy Research said it found only 8.2 percent of doctors had
ownership interests in health-care facilities in 1990. That was down from
the 8.3 percent in 1989 and 9.3 percent in 1988, it said. The AMA's top
researcher tried to explain the drop by suggesting the investments were
"perhaps not as profitable as \[they\] used to be." But longtime AMA lawyer
B. J. Anderson suggested another reason to the _American Medical
News_: "With all the congressional hearings and publicity, physicians
aren't very trusting of any advice on whether it will be permissible or
profitable to have an ownership interest."

But in August, a highly publicized study released by the Florida
Health Care Cost Containment Board struck a blow against selfreferrals.
At the direction of the Florida legislature, the board hired
Jean M. Mitchell and Elton Scott of Florida State University to survey
some 3,000 freestanding medical facilities in the state. About 82 percent
replied, a high rate resulting from the legislative mandate. From this survey
Mitchell and Scott estimated that 7,600 doctors, or about 40 percent
of the physicians involved in direct patient care, owned facilities to which
they referred patients. Forty percent. That number dwarfed all previous
studies, more than tripling the level found by the HHS Inspector General
and quadrupling the AMA's findings.

Physician involvement in the freestanding facilities was significant.
Doctors owned more than half of the existing facilities in the state in four
of the ten types of facilities. Based on the survey, Mitchell and Scott concluded
that abuses were most common in three types of doctor-owned
arrangements: diagnostic imaging centers, clinical laboratories, and
physical therapy-rehabilitation centers. They found that doctor-owned
clinical labs performed almost twice as many tests as did independently
owned labs. The average charge at the doctor-owned lab was $43, compared
with $20 for other labs. Because doctors owned nearly all the MRI
centers in Florida, the researchers compared the rates of use for the MRI
centers in Miami with those in Baltimore, where two teaching hospitals
are located. They found that MRI scanners were used 65 percent more
often in Miami than in Baltimore.

The researchers rebutted the AMA's main argument for physician
investment in medical facilities. The AMA said patients benefited from
physician investments because they brought technology to areas that
needed it. But they found physician-owned facilities "do not increase access
to rural or underserved indigent patients." In fact, for the ventures
with highest physician ownership---labs, imaging centers, and physicaltherapy
facilities---Mitchell and Scott concluded that they provided less
access for elderly patients, used more services, billed at higher rates, and
were more profitable than other independent facilities.[^5/43]

### The New Professionalism

AMA leaders took note of the fallout from the controversy over selfreferrals.
At its June 1991 annual meeting, the AMA's official line switched
to emphasize "professionalism and the new AMA." In his inaugural
speech the new president, Dr. John J. Ring, summed up the image the
AMA sought to project: "It is time we prove to America, in deed as well as
word, that we are a doctors' organization, working for the good of our
patients, rather than a pressure group aiming for political power as a way
to build organizational predominance, to create personal prestige or to
line our own pockets!"[^5/44]

The AMA even gave Dr. Relman a platform to express his views. In a
_JAMA_ profile, Relman said he understood the problems the AMA faces
as a large umbrella organization. The AMA has the obligation to represent
its members, he said, which means it must reflect the current attitudes
of a variety of doctors. That means it will take the most
conservative, most acceptable route. But that means the AMA must lag
behind on some very important issues, such as conflicts of interest. Unfortunately,
he said, that does not help the image of the AMA or doctors.
"When the AMA is seen as serving the public interest, not just saying it
serves the public interest," Relman said, "then I think that its image will
improve."[^5/45]

Meanwhile, the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs appointed a
task force to reexamine the question of self-referrals. The AMA chose
Dr. Russel H. Patterson, a Manhattan surgeon and the former chairman
of the council when it developed the AMA's stance on self-referrals; Newton
Minow, the AMA's lawyer in its battle against the FTC, who was better
known for his attack on the "wasteland" of television during his chairmanship
of the Federal Communications Commission in the early
1960s; and Robert Veatch, director of the Kennedy School of Ethics at
Georgetown University.

In an interview later, Veatch said, "I invited them to use this as an
opportunity to decide what their future image would be. You could
choose either what I called the professional role, which holds forth the
ideal that physicians do what's best for the patient and have no selfinterest,
or you could choose the entrepreneurial role, and be like
businesspeople." It was the classic conflict between the two symbols of
medicine: the single snake-on-the-staff of Asklepios the healer vs. the
two snakes of Mercury, god of businessmen and profiteers.

Veatch said he was not committed to one role or the other. "I was prepared
for them to go either route. I think once the choice was presented
that starkly to them, they were in a spot where they couldn't say, 'We want
to be entrepreneurial businessmen.' They clearly wanted to hold on to
the idea of being a profession."

But the task force did not recommend a change in AMA policy to the
council, according to Patterson. He had helped mold the AMA's previous
stand, and the task force "took a much more permissive position as a
group, at least as far as the ethics were concerned." He said he felt the
level of abuse by self-referring physicians was "hard to pinpoint," and expressed
concern that a shift in policy could result in fewer facilities. That
would harm patients by restricting access.

The council, however, took a less permissive approach. "I think the
position the council finally took was that even the appearance, or potential
(of conflict of interest), was too much, and that therefore physician
ownerships should be restricted," Patterson said. "The feeling on the
council was that Caesar's wife had to be above suspicion." Patterson said
that view was pushed by the "young physicians" in AMA membership
and on the council. Both Patterson and Veatch raised questions about the
council banning self-referrals to outside facilities while permitting them
to continue inside the doctor's office. Patterson said, "I think the logic
that has been used by Arnold Relman, the former editor of the _New England
Journal_, is that the physician is directly involved in performing or
supervising the performance" of the in-office test, diagnosis, or other
service.

In December 1991 the council issued its report. "The Council believes
that it is necessary to strengthen its opinion of self-referral," the
report concluded. It cited two reasons. First, physician investments and
self-referrals "have on balance been positive for patients and the nation's
health-care system," the report said. "But anecdotes of excessive profit
and utilization have been widespread, and the formal studies which have
been done strongly suggest, although they do not prove, inherent problems
with the practice." And second, the report cited a change in national
priorities, placing cost control as the "dominant concern." Besides, the
report noted, the United States already has "unparalleled" facilities and
technology available.

"Physicians are not simply business people with high standards," the
council concluded. "Physicians are engaged in the special calling of healing,
and, in that calling, they are the fiduciaries of their patients. They
have different and higher duties than even the most ethical business person."
It added, "There are some activities involving their patients that
physicians should avoid whether or not there is evidence of abuse."

The council noted for the first time that in self-referral arrangements
"a potential conflict of interest exists." But it did not ban physician
investment in health-care facilities; the council continued to support it.
What the council sought to squelch was the practice of self-referrals: "In
general, physicians should not refer patients to a health-care facility ...
when they have an investment interest in the facility."

In some cases, the council concluded, self-referrals were okay, but
only if there is a need in the community and no other way to finance the
facility. Even then, the doctor-investors had to meet ten standards before
the self-referral would pass muster under the AMA's new ethical guidelines.
[^5/46]

The new guidelines left some physicians in the lurch. The council
recognized the difficult spot entrepreneurial doctors were in, but
could offer little comfort. Many physicians had invested in facilities
under the AMA's looser guidelines adopted in 1986. The council
suggested they reevaluate their investment and either divest or restructure
the deal to meet the new guidelines. And if that wasn't possible, the
council suggested physician-investors identify an alternative for their patients.

The delegates at the December meeting adopted the report, although
some did so with great misgivings. The AMA stressed unity, but it was
beset by undercurrents of discontent. Dr. Oscar W. Clarke, the council's
chairman, said, "There is an ethical line we have to draw in the commercial
world. We want to get that done before the public confidence is
eroded, setting policy before someone else comes in and does it for us."
Dr. John L. Clowe, the AMA's president-elect, added, "If Representative
Stark and the Congress see that we have imposed these standards and
the profession is complying with them, they will see that the necessity for
additional legislation is not there."[^5/47]

### The Flip-Flop

In April 1992 the AMA tried to use its new image and new ethics to cut a
deal with the Federal Trade Commission. Ever since the AMA lost its battle
with the regulatory agency a decade earlier, its leaders had attempted
to figure out a way to loosen the FTC's grip over physician activities. Part
of the strategy was to show the government and the public that the AMA
was a responsible organization that could regulate itself and be trusted
not to put its own interest ahead of patients and the public.

The AMA sent an eleven-page letter to Janet Steiger, the FTC chairman,
seeking the commission's support on a variety of "self-regulatory
initiatives." Exhibit 1 in its appeal to the FTC was its difficult and unpopular
new stand on self-referrals. "Professionalism, in all of its aspects,
is a priority of the profession today," the appeal said. The AMA cited the
December report by its Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, noting,
"The treatment of the self-referral question has important symbolic significance
for the public and policymakers with regard to which of two
alternative conceptualizations of the physician's role---that of professional
or that of entrepreneur---the medical profession will move toward
the era of health-care reform."

But this new image was short-lived. A crack in the façade of physician
unity appeared shortly before the AMA's annual June 1992 meeting.
The Medical Society of New Jersey had adopted a resolution in May that
was directly in conflict with the new AMA stand. Seeking to return the
standard to the one AMA adopted in 1986, the New Jersey society's resolution
said "a physician's referral to an off-site medical facility in which he
has a financial interest is an ethical referral, as long as the patient is fully
informed of the ownership interest and alternate facilities (if available)
are named."

Dr. William E. Ryan, president of the New Jersey society and part
owner of a clinical lab, said the stand was not a renunciation of AMA policy,
but a reaction to the state of New Jersey's 1990 law barring selfreferrals.
The law, however, grandfathered in existing ventures. Ryan
also said he did not see a conflict with the AMA ethical position, but an
AMA physician-lawyer, Dr. David Orentlicher, disagreed. "If we are
going to have an independent council deliberating and setting policy, we
can't be putting ethics to a vote, and we can't be setting different guidelines
for different states."[^5/48]

But at the June meeting that is exactly what the AMA House of Delegates
did: they put the new stricter policy on self-referrals to a vote. The
New Jersey delegation introduced a proposal that allowed "medically necessary"
self-referrals as long as the ownership interest was disclosed.
The Florida delegation joined the New Jersey doctors in pushing for the
policy reversal. The AMA's top leaders---Chief Executive Todd, President
Ring, _JAMA_ editor Dr. George Lundberg-lined up on the other
side, seeking to preserve the ethical high ground. But over the objections
of the Board of Trustees and the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs,
the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the stricter stand and embraced
the New Jersey proposal.

Dr. Ulrich F. Danckers, a member of the Illinois delegation, summed
up the conflict: "We have embarked on a major effort to convince the
Federal Trade Commission that the profession is able to control errant
behavior of physicians. Our ethical statement is a major part of that
effort, and we can't allow this resolution to blunt its well-balanced
impact."[^5/49]

But it had. Stark called the AMA delegates' action "an Oath of Hypocrisy,"
and said it would "disembowel their previous, admirable stand
against the corrupting influence" of self-referral. One of the chief
concerns voiced by many within the AMA hierarchy as well as among
members was that the government would feel it must step in because
organized medicine had failed to take a stand. The issue had gone
beyond one of simple economics. Study after study showed that selfreferral
increased the cost of health care. Several states moved to ban
self-referrals, the some state medical societies fought the laws. And soon
the AMA would be tested by more attempts at federal legislation.

### Reversing the Reversal

As the AMA Board and Judicial Council prepared to reverse the reversal
at the December 1992 meeting, Relman urged them to retake the high
ground. Although Relman supported the AMA's efforts to get concessions
from the FTC and to boost its own self-regulatory structure, he
warned against battling legislation that sought to ban self-referrals. As he
put it, such efforts "merely strengthen the public's impression that physicians
are more interested in pursuing their own economic interests than
in preserving their good name or helping to keep costs down." Such
efforts usually failed, he wrote, "leaving a residue of public cynicism and
ill will toward organized medicine."[^5/50]

The debate was heated and divisive. The New Jersey delegation was
particularly adamant. But the AMA's leadership and trustees lobbied
delegates aggressively. Ring, who had made the return to professionalism
the hallmark of his tenure as AMA president, pleaded with delegates
to take the high road. AMA president-elect Dr. Joseph T. Painter tried
another tack. The profession cannot afford to be seen favoring profit
over professionalism at a time when the AMA is seeking breaks from the
FTC on self-regulation and the right for physicians to collectively negotiate
with third-party payers, he said. And, as health-care reform became a
national issue, the AMA had to avoid even the appearance of conflict of
interest so that it would be taken seriously in the national debate.

The leadership prevailed. The delegates readopted the board's position
on self-referrals. The final AMA position was not as pure as Relman
had proposed, but it was closer than it had been at any time during the
1980s. Physicians could still own off-site medical facilities, but save for a
few exceptions, they could not refer their patients to them, the AMA's
ethical policy said. The policy also gave those who had invested under the
AMA's old policy until 1995 to comply with the new guidelines. Relman
complimented the efforts of Todd and AMA general counsel Kirk B.
Johnson for taking the lead on the issue, but he still believed there were
too many exceptions.

"There is still a rear-guard action that's being waged against this," he
said, referring to doctors investing in such ventures as home-infusion
treatments. "They write to me and they tell me that they're different, that
they don't violate the principle of no self-referral because they really take
responsibility for those patients. And by that reasoning of course a surgeon
should be allowed to invest in ambulatory surgery centers because
they take care of their patients in those centers. I don't buy that for a
moment."

## THE END OF SELF-REFERRALS

Representative Stark followed through on his promise and introduced a
bill in January 1993 to ban all self-referrals, whether the tab was being
picked up by the federal government or privately. The facilities targeted
by the bill included clinical laboratories, physical-therapy services,
occupational-therapy services, radiology services, durable medical
equipment, outpatient prescription drugs, ambulances, home infusion
therapy, and inpatient and outpatient hospital services. The new Clinton
administration made clear that a ban on physician self-referrals was part
of its overall plans for health-care reform. In its proposed budget for the
Department of Health and Human Services, the Administration said by
excluding self-referrals it would save $250 million over the next four
years.[^5/51]

The AMA's response was markedly different than in the past. After
the bill was introduced, Dr. Nancy Dickey, an AMA trustee, did not outright
reject the legislation. Instead, she said, "We look forward to talking
with Representative Stark about the importance of exceptions which address
unmet patient needs such as a community unserved or underserved
were it not for the commitment of their physician citizens."[^5/52]

At an April 1993 hearing held by Stark on his new bill, Dickey delivered
the AMA's assessment: "The AMA believes that H.R. 345, as
drafted, would establish an overly broad prohibition. The AMA would
find the bill more acceptable if modified to meet certain conditions."[^5/53]
The AMA listed the conditions, and for all indications, Stark and his subcommittee
seemed amenable to negotiating on the points raised by
Dickey.

The "new" AMA attempts to avoid saying no. Instead, it says there is
a better way. In an era of health-care reform, perhaps the AMA knew it
would lose this one anyway. Yet it took the organization more than a
dozen years to put the self-interest of its members aside and look the bigger
picture. And then the AMA's action was not for purely ethical
reasons, but for PR and as part of a strategy to play a more important
role in the national health-care debate. But by the time the AMA leaders
even recognized this need, damage had been done. Was it too late?

"I don't know that it is too late," said Relman. "I think that serious
damage was done, which has not yet been undone. I think to the extent
that the profession as a whole ... is viewed with suspicion and with
some hostility ... I think \[the AMA\] position on self-referral was damaging.
... I think it has hurt the medical profession as a whole. It has
hurt the credibility of the AMA, and the respect with which the medical
profession has been generally regarded."

As long as doctors have the potential to put themselves first and exploit
their patients financially, from self-referrals or other conflicts of interests,
patient-doctor relations will suffer. But Relman is optimistic: "I
think that if the AMA continues to adopt publicly responsible and
forward-looking policies, if it makes clear to the public and to government
that it wants to help devise a health-care system that meets the public's
needs, I think the damage can be undone."[^5/54]
