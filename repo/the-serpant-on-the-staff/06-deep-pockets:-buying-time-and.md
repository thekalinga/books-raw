# Deep Pockets: Buying Time and Clout in Washington[^4/0]

The American Medical Association
may not win every political battle in Washington, but more often
than not it gets its way. That's because politicians have learned that when
the AMA talks, it pays to listen. The AMA represents the country's
wealthiest profession, and it is not shy about using money to gain access
to lawmakers. Few other special interests have invested as much money in
politics, or have the resources to do so, as the AMA.

In the past two decades, the AMA easily has spent more than $100
million of its own money to influence public policy by lobbying through
its Washington office and providing "political education" to its members.[^4/1]
In fact, about a quarter of each AMA member's dues---$420 each
year for full-fledged members---goes directly to finance lobbying alone.
In addition, the AMA's political funding arm, the American Medical
Political Action Committee (AMPAC), raised and distributed another
$34 million to political activities and congressional campaigns across
the country.[^4/2]

AMPAC best illustrates the AMA's ability and willingness to use
money to make friends in Washington. In nearly every election since
1972, when the government began keeping records of political donations,
AMPAC has been at or near the top of the list of special interests
that contribute to candidates' campaign funds. In fact, AMPAC ranks
second out of more than 4,000 PACs in making direct contributions to
federal candidates in the past two decades. And AMPAC---whose sponsor
has 270,000 members---has donated much more than the PACs
sponsored by larger, well-known special-interest groups: a fifth more
than the United Auto Workers (1.4 million members); 50 percent more
than the National Education Association (2 million); and three times as
much as the National Rifle Association (2.5 million).

Not surprisingly, the AMA has become a fixture in Washington as
the rich, powerful, and politically sophisticated Doctors Lobby. It is so entrenched
that it has special ties to the Federal Election Commission, the
only federal agency created to monitor and regulate political action committees.
A former top AMPAC executive is one of six commissioners on
the FEC. And when the cramped agency decided to move, the commissioner
helped select an AMA-owned building as the new site.

As the jockeying for position at the negotiating table for the healthcare
reform of the 1990s began, the number of health-related lobbies
has rapidly multiplied. Increasingly, the AMA appears to be one voice of
many. But to retain its disproportionate clout, the AMA has reached into
its deep pockets and again has outspent them all. The AMA and AMPAC
have written checks at one time to the campaign chests of nearly every
representative and senator in the current Congress, which will decide the
future of the health-care system. As in the past, the AMA will seek to protect
doctors and scuttle major reform by persuading lawmakers to delay,
dilute, or delete legislation it doesn't like. The AMA is banking that its investment
in this Congress---a total of $11.4 million---will pay off.

## BIRTH OF A NEW POLITICAL MACHINE

At one time the AMA had scant power and little influence over lawmakers.
From its founding in 1847 until the early part of this century it
was a weak organization, with no full-time staff, a meager budget, and
little prestige. Created as an educational and scientific association dedicated
to improving the status and image of doctors, it began laying
groundwork for the future by pushing for state licensing of doctors and
waging waron abortion.

At the turn of the century, the AMA restructured itself into a
stronger organization and at the same time created a lobbying arm, the
Committee on Medical Legislation. The three-member committee set
up the AMA's first political machine: a network of doctors across the
country who volunteered to contact their state and federal legislators to
press the profession's interests "by any honorable means."[^4/3] Special interests
certainly plied candidates with money---most money came from
Wall Street and Big Business---but they didn't have to report it. The AMA
then most likely was too poor, and perhaps too idealistic, to spread much
money around.

The AMA's political strength grew over time, and the AMA became,
like most special interests, adept at blocking change it did not like. With
the onset of the Depression and the New Deal, the AMA continued its
lobbying and propaganda campaigns, putting its prestige on the line
against the liberalism of the times. But the AMA's clash with reformers
gave it a reputation as a powerful trade group rather than the AMA's selfimage
of a high-minded educational and scientific organization.

The AMA's first foray into establishing a separate political fund came
at the end of the Depression, when the doctors of the AMA sensed their
power had slipped. To avoid a clash with the IRS over the AMA's taxexempt
status, a past AMA president and other members founded the
National Physicians' Committee for the Extension of Medical Service.
The committee was endorsed by the AMA's House of Delegates, and
90 percent of its funds were donated by pharmaceutical companies. But
in 1948 it closed down after embarrassing the AMA with an anti-Semitic
letter addressing "fellow Christians" and an ill-advised contest for editorial
cartoonists seeking to ridicule national health insurance. In its nine
years of existence, the committee spent about $1 million on ads, pamphlets,
radio, and other propaganda.[^4/4]

### Big Money

The AMA solidified its reputation as a big-money lobby after World
War II, outspending even the AFL-CIO's $835,000 unsuccessful advertising
campaign against the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947,[^4/5] To fight President
Harry S Truman's plan for a government-run and tax-financed healthcare
system, AMA leaders assessed their members $25 each. With that
money, the AMA reported it spent $1.5 million in 1949. And over three
and a half years, the AMA spent nearly $5 million for its campaign. In
today's dollars, that would equal nearly $30 million.[^4/6]

The AMA also spent money liberally to influence congressional
races. In 1950 it organized a massive $3.1 million advertising campaign,
tying into business ads, against liberals and for conservatives during a
two-week stretch just before the election. Meanwhile doctors from state
medical societies set up "healing arts committees," patterned after union
committees on political education, to beat liberal Democrats. In two cases
the doctors' victories came back to haunt them. Florida doctors helped
fund a successful drive to defeat Senator Claude D. Pepper. He returned
to Congress in 1962 when he won a seat in the House, where he focused
on liberal health initiatives until his death in 1989. Wisconsin doctors defeated
Representative Andrew Beimiller, who joined the AFL-CIO and
became a key leader in labor's fight for national health insurance and
Medicare.[^4/7]

But the AMA did buy itself some time. After watching the AMA's expensive
campaign against Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower welcomed not
only the support of the AMA but also hired its PR firm, Whitaker and
Baxter, for his successful presidential bid. According to author Richard
Harris, Eisenhower made a deal with the AMA. His Administration
would oppose national health insurance if the AMA would back a new
Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The AMA had blocked
similar departments in the past because it wanted a separate health department
headed by a doctor. Eisenhower tapped Oveta Culp Hobby to
head HEW, and she announced she would run it as an "AMA Administration."[^4/8]
National health insurance lay dormant in the 1950s.

### Off the Charts

The AMA, like other special interests, was well aware that in Washington
perception of power is as important as real power. Since money is power,
big spenders are seen as powerful. When Congress after the war passed a
law requiring special interests to register and report how much they
spent on direct lobbying, many groups refused to file, or if they did, underreported
expenses. The AMA filed its reports under protest, and one
year itemized spending in a blinding eight-page report of single-spaced
type without breaks. _Congressional Quarterly_, which annually publishes
lobby spending, noted, "This method of reporting is unique with the
AMA." But the AMA reported a large enough sum each year to become a
fixture on the _CQ_ list.[^4/9]

The AMA, like other special interests, used the list as needed. When
it did wish to be seen as a big spender, it changed its reporting procedures
to lower the amount. For example, in 1954 the AMA said it spent
$39,120 on direct lobbying, but its audited financial statement showed it
spent $210,700 on its Washington office. [^4/10] When the AMA wanted to
impress friends and foes with its economic power, it filed more complete
reports.

_CQ_ each year published a list of the top lobby spending, and the
AMA reported the three highest annual lobbying expenses recorded,
each of them coming in at more than $1 million. The AMA reported
spending the two highest yearly amounts in 1949($1.5 million) and 1950
($1.3 million) on its successful campaign against Truman. And it spent
the third-highest amount in 1965, $1.1 million, on its unsuccessful fight
against Medicare.[^4/11]

## PAC ATTACK

In 1960 the razor-thin victory of John F. Kennedy over Richard M.
Nixon again jarred AMA officials into action. The AMAs archenemies---liberals and labor unions---backed Kennedy, who as a senator had
pushed for Medicare. Just four months after he took office, the AMA created
the American Medical Political Action Committee, or AMPAC.
Through AMPAC, the AMA could collect money from members and
others to make contributions to House and Senate candidates who
agreed with the agenda of the M.D.s. [^4/12]

it was a gutsy move. No trade or business group had set up a national
PAC before. The field belonged to labor. During World War II, the Congress
of Industrial Organizations created the first PAC. When it merged
with the American Federation of Labor in 1955, the new AFL-CIO
started several national Committees on Political Education. The next
year the COPEs spent $2.1 million on candidates. [^4/13] AMA Board members
and staff took note, and pondered the idea of starting their own
PAC. At least eight state medical societies had set up PACs, but AMA officials
hesitated.

Most of them feared the reaction of the Justice Department and the
IRS. The AMA's tax-exempt status could be jeopardized, they said, since
law bars not-for-profit organizations from making political contributions.
They also worried about being accused of violating the Federal
Corrupt Practices Act. And they simply did not trust the federal government,
with which they had clashed so long.

So the AMA took special pains to set up a separate organization, settling
AMPAC into a building three blocks away from AMA headquarters.
The board's final vote also hinged on the reaction of the Justice Department.
When it did not react, the board officially launched AMPAC. The
new PAC immediately began soliciting AMA members, their spouses,
and their friends to join. In keeping with the AMA's hostility to government
oversight, AMPAC set sustaining membership dues at $99, because
contributions of $100 or more had to be reported. In its first year,
AMPAC raised about $200,000 from more than 13,000 members. [^4/14]

But for a real boost, AMPAC secretly turned to the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers' Association, a trade group for drug companies. The
AMA-PMA connection was strong. The two groups often joined forces to
lobby Congress, and the AMAs general counsel became the PMAs executive
director. Seventeen of the nation's biggest drug firms gave nearly
$1 million to AMPAC in its first three years, according to internal AMA
documents that were leaked years later. AMPAC could not use the money
for campaign contributions, but it could use it to set up its offices and pay
administrative costs, as well as to solicit funds it could give to candidates'
political funds. [^4/15]

In its first two elections, AMPAC funneled support to conservatives
on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, the tax-writing
body that considers bills on national health insurance. In its first outing,
AMPAC claimed that 70 percent of the candidates it backed won. In the
1962 and 1964 elections, AMPAC spent about $700,000. Although it was
too little and too late to stop Medicare, it helped the AMA shape the program
to benefit doctors.

### AMPAC Flexes Its Muscles

The enactment of Medicare in 1965 demolished the AMA's image as an
invincible lobby and demoralized AMA members. Soon the aftershocks
of defeat shook the AMA. Labor and liberal Democrats announced a
drive to pass a universal national-health-care system, and AMA membership
began declining rapidly. The AMA needed a victory badly to prove
both to the outside world and to its own members that it remained an
organization to be reckoned with.

The opportunity came along in 1969 with the opening of a position
in the new Nixon White House of the top health official, the Assistant
Secretary for Health at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.
The new HEW Secretary, Robert Finch, had made up his mind by
the time Richard M. Nixon was inaugurated to push for the director of
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Dr. John H. Knowles. But
Finch soon found his choice was far too liberal and too antagonistic for
the AMA to survive. [^4/16]

For five months Finch urged Nixon and his top aides to appoint
Knowles to the post. But the AMA had turned to its friends in Congress
to lobby against the liberal Boston physician, who was associated with
hospitals more than with doctors. AMA officials did not like Knowles,
and they had other candidates in mind, including the nephew of the
AMA's president.

The AMA had a powerful ally, Senator Everett Dirksen (R-I11.), working
behind the scenes. But Finch, a close Nixon friend, appeared to win
and in June sent a letter to the White House nominating Knowles. At the
last minute the AMA's case was bolstered by the top GOP fund-raisers in
the Senate and House. Press reports say Senator John Tower of Texas visited
the White House and said, "There are a lot of well-qualified men for
this job. There's no reason to alienate a large group of contributors." The
contributors he referred to were the doctors at AMPAC, which gave some
$682,000 to the campaigns of Republicans and conservative Democrats
in the 1968 election.

Nixon pulled the plug on Knowles. Knowles blamed the AMA and
AMPAC, which he said were his only opponents. Newpaper editorials
thundered about the power of the AMA and the influence of AMPAC's
contributions on politicians, especially Dirksen. True to the secretive politics
of the day, the AMA denied it had opposed Knowles. Years later, the
AMA acknowledged its opposition, and one official said the Knowles affair
was important in reestablishing the clout of the AMA.

AMPAC had been key to bolstering the image of AMA power following
Medicare, but AMPAC took steps to consolidate its position, and by
the end of the 1960s the AMPAC crowd had taken over the AMA. Soon
after its founding, AMPAC became the breeding ground for future AMA
leaders, who before had come from more scientific or educational backgrounds.
The AMA's chief executive then, Dr. F. J. L. Blasingame, distrusted
AMPAC and was well aware of its threat to what he labeled the
"scientific-educational" AMA. Blasingame described the new breed
spawned by AMPAC: "What you had now were people interested in political
action, people who liked that kind of life. It was a tougher crowd.
More aggressive." By 1968 Blasingame was openly challenging the
AMPAC crowd and the AMPAC crowd was fighting back. In the end,
the AMPAC faction won by electing its candidates to the AMA board
of trustees, reorganizing the board, and setting up a showdown with
Blasingame. The board asked for Blasingame's resignation. He refused.
So the board fired him. [^4/17]

The complete takeover came six years later. In the most controversial
election in AMA history, the board picked Dr. James H. Sammons to be
the AMA's chief executive. Sammons had risen rapidly through the
ranks, making stops as chairman of the Texas Medical Political Action
Committee and AMPAC before becoming the AMA's board chairman.
Sammons' mentor was a former AMPAC chairman, Dr. John Kernodle
(who was forced to resign because of an unrelated bank-fraud conviction)
and his righthand man was Joe D. Miller, AMPAC's first director.
When Sammons took over and found the AMA finances deep in the red,
one of the first things he did was to shrink the number of the AMA's
scientific councils.

### AMPAC Rising

During the 1970s, AMPAC quickly moved up among the ranks of all
PACs to dominate the field. In its first decade of existence, AMPAC spent
far less than the labor unions. But in its second decade, it caught up and
passed them. The progression came election by election. In the 1972
two-year election cycle, AMPAC trailed only the AFL-CIO and the
United Auto Workers in political contributions. In the 1974 elections,
AMPAC moved up a place to become second only to the AFL-CIO. By
1976 AMPAC had risen to the top, becoming only the second PAC to contribute
more than $1 million to federal candidates in an election cycle.
AMPAC contributions have never dipped below the $1 million level
since. [^4/18]

More and more the AMA focused on the "socioeconomic," which
was the buzz word then for politics, and less and less did it concern
itself with educational and scientific efforts. Although the AMA spent
just a fifth of its budget on its political efforts in 1971, a top AMA official
noted "the ballgame for medicine will be won or lost in the socioeconomic
area."[^4/19]

The 1970s also ushered in an era of campaign-finance reform. A
congressional flap in the 1960s and the Watergate scandal pushed Congress
into enacting the most sweeping campaign reforms ever. The laws
legitimized political action committees set up by special interests such as
labor unions, corporations, and trade associations. But the laws also required
them to disclose how they spent their money: PACs were required
to file finance reports ten times during each two-year election cycle.

But AMPAC wasn't satisfied with filing only ten reports. In 1972 FEC
records show AMPAC filed dozens more reports than most other PACs.
And in 1973 and 1974, an AMPAC bulletin noted, AMPAC filed 130
times, many times amending earlier reports. This defeated the purpose
of the law, which was to make it easier for citizens and voters to see who
was contributing money to candidates. But when asked directly, AMPAC
officials, unlike those for other PACs, refused to say which candidates
it was supporting or even how many contributing members it had.
AMPAC's chairman said, "We have conscientiously and explicitly followed
the letter and intent of the law in reporting our contributions."[^4/20]

AMPAC had created a complicated arrangement with the fifty-two
PACs of state and territorial medical societies. They conducted joint
fund-raising campaigns and shared information about candidates. They
shifted funds back and forth, filing amendments and other documents
with the FEC when they did. AMPAC officials claimed the final decisions
on which candidates to support came from the state PACs. And when it
came time to contribute, AMPAC would usually send a check to a local
doctor who was the politician's key contact. A letter accompanying the
check would point out that AMPAC was giving the money at the request
of local doctors. Sometimes a state PAC would add a check of its own. [^4/21]

AMPAC insisted that it and the state PACs were completely separate
entities. And it emphatically stated that the AMA had nothing to do with
AMPAC. The AMA took reporters to task for writing that the AMA had
contributed to political candidates. The AMA, officials said, has never
spent a penny on a political campaign. AMPAC, they said, does that.

But that assertion was undermined when someone dubbed "Sore
Throat" in the 1970s leaked several confidential AMA memos to the
press. One series of memos described how drug companies had contributed
$851,000 to AMPAC in its first three years, a secret until then.
Another package of a dozen memos described how AMA lobbyists
requested AMPAC contributions for specific candidates, and AMPAC
usually complied. For example, lobbyists asked AMPAC to give to a reception
for Mendel J. Davis (D-S.C.), because "Mendel has introduced every
bill we have provided." And the lobbyists asked AMPAC to make up for its
"mistakes" by giving a donation to a particular candidate: "We opposed
\[him\] in the primary. This might be a vehicle for patching that up."[^4/22]

The published reports caught the interest of the Federal Election
Commission, the agency set up by Congress to make campaign-finance
records public and to investigate violations of campaign laws. The press
widely reported that the AMA was being investigated for possibly violating
prohibitions against nonprofit organizations making campaign contributions.[^4/23]
But the FEC backed off after a review of the law. It never
determined if the charges were true. Its letter to the AMA explained
why: even if it was true that the AMA was directing AMPAC's campaign
contributions, it was not a violation of federal law.[^4/24]

### A Pack of PACs

At the end of 1974, when Congress passed its sweeping campaign reforms,
AMPAC officials assessed the impact, and, with political astuteness,
decided the "reform" was good for them. The AMPAC bulletin
noted, "Many of the authors of this law were in favor of reducing the
influence of special-interest groups. However ... they, in fact, increased
the importance of special-interest giving." The law put a limit on spending
for congressional races (later thrown out by the courts), and allowed
PACs to give up to $5,000 per election (which the courts upheld). The
bulletin noted that if AMPAC and a state PAC each contributed $5,000 to
a candidate for the primary and another $5,000 for the general election,
they could give $20,000. That, it said, is "a fairly substantial portion of a
candidate's budget," giving medicine "a more effective role" in campaigns.[^4/25]

In May 1976 Congress added amendments to the campaign act, including
a "non-proliferation" clause to bar groups from using affiliates to
exceed contribution limits. But that did not stop AMPAC and the state
medical PACs. In September 1976 the reform group Common Cause
released a study that showed that AMPAC and its state affiliates had
contributed more than the legal limit of $5,000 each in contributions
to twenty-one congressional candidates. Aggravating the situation was
the fact that AMPAC and its affiliates, with a couple of months to go
before the election, had contributed nearly $1 million, more than any
other PAC.

A week later, Common Cause filed what it called the first major complaint
against a PAC under the federal campaign-reform law. It wanted
AMPAC stopped immediately. "It is patently unfair to allow the American
Medical Association to play by its own set of rules in the 1976 elections
while others are complying with the letter and spirit of the new
campaign finance law," said Common Cause's vice president then, Fred
Wertheimer. [^4/26]

One of the candidates named by Common Cause returned $1,000
of the $6,000 contributed by AMPAC and a state PAC. And AMPAC filed
its next financial report to the FEC under protest, blaming the FEC for
not making Common Cause keep its complaint confidential. A few days
later, AMPAC filed a formal complaint with the FEC, accusing Common
Cause of violating the campaign law for publicizing its complaint. Ironically,
AMPAC's executive director went public with his complaint that
Common Cause might have broken the law in going public with its complaint.
But the FEC quickly cleared Common Cause. [^4/27]

The FEC, however, also did not stop AMPAC and the state medical
PACs from continuing their excessive joint contributions. In June 1978
Common Cause again filed a complaint with the FEC, this time disclosing
that AMPAC and affiliate contributions were over the limit to fortyfive
candidates. The FEC staff investigated the complaint, compiled
information from the state PACs, and took depositions from AMA
leaders. The doctors' responses were nothing less than hostile, FEC documents
show. In October 1979 the FEC's general counsel found it was
likely AMPAC and at least four state medical PACs had violated the campaign
law's limits. Facing lengthy litigation, AMPAC and its affiliates
entered into a consent agreement with the FEC, stating they would no
longer exceed the limit of $5,000 per election to a candidate [^4/28]

### Combating Carter

Having beaten back national health insurance in the early 1970s, the
AMA now faced a different kind of threat: medical-care cost containment.
The federal government's aim had shifted from simply ensuring
universal access to reining in the skyrocketing costs of health care, particularly
under Medicare and Medicaid. To that end, President Jimmy
Carter proposed a cost-containment program that would cap hospital
expenditures. But the AMA knew from experience that after hospitals,
doctors would be next.

HEW secretary Joseph Califano claimed Carter's cost-containment
plar would save the country some $50 billion over the next five years, but
Carter and Califano found themselves stymied by the AMA and its allies,
the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American
Hospitals. Carter's frustration at being blocked spilled over at a town
meeting in Spokane. "I know that doctors care very seriously about their
patients," Carter said. "But when you get doctors organized into the
American Medical Association their interest is to protect the interest
not of patients, but of doctors. And they've been the major obstacle to
progress in our country in having a better health care system in years
gone by."[^4/29]

At the suggestion of a powerful conservative Democrat, the AMA,
AHA, and FAH created an alternative plan to Carter's proposal. It was
called, fittingly, the Voluntary Effort, and relied on the providers to hold
down costs. A substitute amendment, creating a national commission to
study and monitor hospital costs, was introduced to replace Carter's plan.
And the showdown came on November 15, 1979: the House approved
the substitute amendment 234--166, scuttling Carter's bill.[^4/30]

Califano cited the "effective and well-bankrolled lobbying" of the
AMA and its allies as he spread the blame around for the defeat.[^4/31] The
late PAC opponent Philip Stern took a look at the vote and AMPAC
contributions and wrote, "Did AMA campaign contributions affect that
vote? Again, the figures suggest that they did."[^4/32] A Common Cause study
found that AMPAC had contributed nearly four times more to the legislators
who voted to kill Carter's bill than to those who supported it. Common
Cause's Fred Wertheimer said, "The American Medical Association
has played the central role in the determination of our nation's health
policies, and political contributions are the primary source of its power."[^4/33]

Correlation studies like the one done by Common Cause are controversial.
Many political consultants, legislators, and academics doubt their
validity. PAC officials and some politicians also bristle at the idea that
PAC giving is simply a form of bribery---honest graft. One FEC commissioner
captured this skepticism well: "Saying 'PAC money buys votes' is
the equivalent of looking at the obituary page and concluding that people
die in alphabetical order."[^4/34]

But the AMA's response to the study was a nondenial denial. AMPAC's
chairman called it misleading and scolded Common Cause for attributing
the contributions to the AMA instead of AMPAC, according to the
AMA's newspaper. And AMA executive vice president James H. Sammons
said Congress voted against Carter's bill because it was so poorly
drawn. Neither specifically nor directly denied the charges Common
Cause had leveled.[^4/35] And three years later an AMA political official who
looked back on the defeat of hospital-cost containment as a big achievement
credited "4 A's": "We had allies, an alternative, arguments, and
AMPAC."[^4/36]

One academic who liked PACs found convincing evidence that
AMPAC had rewarded and punished candidates in the next election in
1980 using the cost-containment vote as a "litmus test." Based on roll
votes and 1980 contributions, he found that AMPAC gave its supporters
an average of about $2,500, and opponents about $340. The study
controlled for the liberal or conservative ideology of the candidate,
and found that even liberals who supported the AMA position were rewarded:
AMPAC gave them three times as much as it contributed to conservatives
who opposed the AMA. The study concluded: "The fact that
one specific roll call affected contributions in this case is quite clear."[^4/37]

## Big Daddy

At the start of the 1970s, the AMA appeared to be a struggling hasbeen---weakened
by defeat, red ink, and uncertainty. By the end of the
decade, the AMA had turned itself around, becoming a financially sound
and politically vigorous contender. It had emerged victorious over the
reformers pushing national health insurance and cost-containment
schemes. And AMPAC had become the dominant PAC in the business.
As Wertheimer put it in 1979: "The AMA is the 'Big Daddy' of the American
PAC movement. It has made little secret of its willingness to use
political money to influence public policy."[^4/38]

No other PAC contributed as much money to congressional candidates
as AMPAC did during the 1970s, FEC records show. In the five elections
from 1972 through 1980, AMPAC contributed $5.5 million, or
an average of about $10,300 for each of the 435 seats in the House and
100 seats in the Senate. The second-largest contribution total in that
period was $4.7 million by the United Auto Workers. AMPAC spent another
$2.1 million on administrative expenses and the political education
of physicians---it held workshops where politicians and party
officials spoke to doctors, produced pamphlets and videotapes about the
political process and the AMA's aims, and even encouraged doctors to
run for office.

AMPAC insisted it was bipartisan, giving money to both Democrats
and Republicans. Indeed, during the Carter years, AMPAC made about
as many contributions to Democrats as it did to Republicans. But the
amount of the contributions made AMPAC a virtual arm of the Republican
Party. Of AMPAC's nearly $3 million in contributions in the 1978
and 1980 elections, $2.1 million, or 70 percent, went to Republican candidates.

This partisanship spilled over to the presidential race. AMPAC's policy
was to give money only to congressional and senatorial candidates, not
to presidential candidates. But five former AMA presidents helped establish
a separate committee, "Physicians for Reagan-Bush." To underscore
the AMA leadership's de facto endorsement of the conservative Republican
Ronald Reagan, the committee paid for a full-page ad in the AMA's
newspaper. The ad was so unusual and unprecedented that the newspaper
ran an editorial in the same issue defending the practice.[^4/39]

AMPAC's support of Republicans paid off after Reagan won the
election. The new President appointed Lee Ann Elliott as one of the six
commissioners of the Federal Election Commission. Elliott, a conservative
Republican active in Illinois politics, had the backing of both the Republican
and Democratic senators from Illinois. Since 1979 she had
worked as a political consultant. But it was Elliott's earlier job history that
mattered: from 1951 to 1962 she worked for the AMA in its law division,
and from 1962 to 1979 she served as assistant, and later associate, executive
director of AMPAC.

For AMPAC there were few greater signs of power. To have a former
official, its number-two executive, appointed to the sole regulatory
agency for PACs was a coup. Earlier appointments also had partisan
backgrounds; Big Labor had had its share of appointments. By design
Congress gave the FEC a partisan balance: three commissions were
Democrats and three were Republicans. But a majority of four had to approve
before the FEC could act.

During the 1970s the FEC had looked into two major complaints
about AMPAC, and since it was the nation's largest PAC, it was likely the
FEC would get more complaints about it. But Elliott dismissed potential
conflicts of interest in her written response to Senate Rules Committee
questions before it unanimously approved her appointment. She disclosed
she would receive a monthly AMA pension for the rest of her life,
but she described what she would do if she faced any potential conflict of
interest: "I would recuse myself from decisions where there was a direct
conflict or the appearance of conflict based on the facts of the particular
case."[^4/40]

The AMA was at the peak of its power in the post-Medicare era. One
survey of 135 health care organizations ranked it as the most influential
organization in health policy during the 1970s.[^4/41] And it sought to reinforce
its presence in Washington by buying three parcels in the capital. It
paid $675,000 for a town house---Needham House---where visiting
AMA officials could stay. It spent $13.3 million for the old Potomac Electric
Power Co. headquarters as investment property. And it bought a
piece of property for $3 million at 1101 Vermont Street NW.

That parcel became the site of the AMA's official presence in Washington:
a new twelve-story building that it constructed at a cost of $12.5
million to serve as headquarters for its Washington office and its political
action committee. The AMA and AMPAC moved into the top two stories;
the lower floors were leased to other medical-specialty societies. Sammons
said the building showed lawmakers that the AMA was here to stay.

## PAC AND PROUD

Success with lobbying and PAC contributions in the 1970s encouraged
the AMA to become more aggressive and more open about its political
nature. In 1981, following two studies and a bit of soul-searching, the
AMA board presented its delegates a report explaining the new "functional
profile" of the AMA. Identified as the primary goal of the AMA
was representation of doctors.[^4/42] Second to that came scientific information.
Over the next few years the AMA put its new profile into action, and
the balance of the budget gradually shifted from science to representation.
The AMA's shift---foretold by Dr. F. J. L. Blasingame in 1968 when
he was ousted by the AMPAC crowd---had become official policy.

Meanwhile the political AMA took a higher profile. In 1982 the
AMA officially opened its new Washington office---named the American
Medical Association building, complete with a multimillion-dollar art
collection. That same year, nearly all of the members of the AMA's
policy-setting House of Delegates joined AMPAC as sustaining members,
the highest-dues-paying category. AMPAC officials even publicly
spoke about their strategies and named the candidates they hoped would
win. The FEC's efficient operation made such disclosure a must.

Besides, it was the decade of PACs. The amount of money PACs
spent on elections soared as FEC and Supreme Court rulings unleashed
corporations, which for decades were barred from contributing to federal
candidates. Now they could set up their own PACs, and between
1975 and 1980 the number of corporate PACs exploded from 139 to
1,106, the FEC said. Now PACs were the allies of conservatives, unlike
before, when labor PACs fueled the races of liberals. When Congress
failed to pass public financing of congressional races in 1980, many speculated
that Republicans might win enough seats in 1982 to control the
House for the first time in decades.

With the ascendancy of PACs, AMPAC was no longer shy about its
methods or its wealth. AMPAC defended the PAC movement, and
bashed Common Cause and other critics, in a book it copublished in
1981. Its officials boasted about using such sophisticated political techniques
as selected precinct polling for candidates, which AMPAC originated
in the 1960s. And it proudly told of pioneering the use of two
major loopholes in the campaign-finance laws that allowed it to get
around the $5,000 per election limit on contributions to candidates'
campaign funds.
1982.
One involved polling. Under an obscure provision of the campaign
law, AMPAC has to report only a fraction of the cost of a poll it conducts
for a candidate by withholding the results for two weeks or more. In
1982, the first year AMPAC reported using this loophole, it said it paid
$10,000 each for home district surveys for thirty-six candidates, an expense
that is twice the contribution limit of $5,000 per election. But because
AMPAC held the results for sixty days for most of the candidates, it
had to report only as little as 5 percent of the poll's actual cost as its
in-kind contribution to the candidate. [^4/43] FEC records show AMPAC reported
only $91,070 for such in-kind contributions in the 1982 elections,
even though AMPAC officials admitted they had spent at least four times
as much money for the surveys.

Another innovation involved what are known as independent expenditures.
In 1976 the Supreme Court ruled on a lawsuit charging that
the limits on campaign contributions set by federal election laws violate
First Amendment rights to free speech. The Court ruled that the limits
could stand for direct contributions to a campaign, but that contributors
could spend as much as they wanted to independently of the campaign.

This meant contributors, such as AMPAC, had to abide by the $5,000
limit for direct contributions to a candidate's campaign fund. But the
contributor, on its own, could spend unlimited amounts of money promoting
a candidate as long as the contributor acted completely separately
and independently of that candidate and his or her campaign. Soa
contributor could spend thousands of dollars to run television advertising
for a candidate as long as the contributor had no contact whatsoever
with the candidate. Similarly, a contributor could spend thousands for
advertising against a candidate as long as the contributor had no contact
with the candidates running against the targeted politician.[^4/44]

AMPAC made its first independent expenditures in the election that
followed the Supreme Court ruling, spending about $58,000 on magazine
advertisements for selected candidates and buying campaign buttons
in ten congressional districts. And in the 1980 elections, AMPAC
spent about $180,000 for television spots for seven candidates and direct
mail for another seven. All but one of them won. In the 1982 elections,
AMPAC increased its independent expenditure again, spending more
than $220,000 on 21 candidates, FEC records show.

### The Turnaround

Given the shift in the mood of the country from liberal to conservative,
the 1980s should have been a replay of the 1950s for the AMA. Without
the threat of national health insurance, and the Reagan administration's
loosening of the restraints on capitalists, the AMA should have enjoyed
the same prosperity and peace as it did under Eisenhower. But instead it
faced a series of crises, some brought on by outside forces, others
brought on by itself. The first test of power involved the Federal Trade
Commission. Ruling on a lawsuit by the AMA, the Supreme Court upheld
the FTC's jurisdiction over doctors and other professionals. Having
lost its court battle, the AMA turned to Congress to pass a law exempting
professions from FTC regulation.[^4/45]

At first it appeared that the sophisticated lobbying of the AMA
would work. The AMA and its allies had successfully tapped into the
antiregulation fever that swept much of Washington and the country
during the Carter years. The FTC was even described as "a rogue agency
gone insane." Representative Thomas Luken (D-Ohio), the key sponsor
of the exemption, said, "I don't want the FTC to practice its brand of
quackery in regulating medicine."

But the tide began to turn against the AMA when unlikely partners
joined together to oppose the exemption. Already, the AMA had battled
against the consumer activists, who argued from a liberal point of view
that doctors and other professionals needed to be regulated. But then
the Reagan-appointed FTC chairman opposed the exemption on ideological
grounds. Without regulation, he reasoned, the free market cannot
work in health care.

Meanwhile the consumer activists discovered and publicized the link
between AMPAC campaign contributions and the congressional sponsors
of the legislation exempting professionals. The news media picked
up on the link---at a time when PAC spending was controversial, it
seemed to establish that special interests indeed do try to buy votes.
AMPAC's strength as a big contributor was being turned against it and
into a weakness.

Michael Pertschuk, the FTC chairman under Carter and among
those opposing the AMA, later wrote in _Giant Killers_ how the Naderite
group Congress Watch issued a series of studies and press releases about
the link. The first study and release, in March, said the PACs of the AMA,
the American Dental Association, and a third health group, the American
Optometric Association, had contributed $863,810 from 1979 to
1981 to 157 House and Senate sponsors of the exemption. The second
one, in June, reported that the PAC contributions now topped $1 million,
as 186 of the 192 cosponsors received an average of $6,145. The third
study focused on the AMA.

The AMA and AMPAC officials derided the connection between exemption
sponsors and campaign contributions as "total nonsense" and
"baloney." And the AMA prevailed in the House, when it voted to exempt
the professions---by seven votes. Later, political scientist Kirk Brown
studied the vote and the contributions and concluded: "Since only seven
votes would have had to be changed for the professionals' exemption to
have been defeated in the House, it is not difficult to conclude that AMA's
and ADA's campaign contributions of over $1.5 million to House members
during the 1982 election provided the margin of victory."[^4/46]

But a few days later, feeling the pressure of negative publicity, the
Senate spiked it, with fifty-seven senators voting against it. The AMA and
AMPAC had lost both the exemption and a chunk of their reputation for
political effectiveness. Their success in raising and contributing campaign
funds had been turned against them. It would be a tactic thrown
up against them again, and AMPAC's reputation as a big spender began
working as much against the AMA's goals as it did for them.

### The FEC's Landlord

Thousands of reporters and consumer activists have walked through the
front doors of the old PEPCO building at 999 E Street NW in Washington
to use the well-lighted first-floor public-document room of the
Federal Election Commission. There, they examine the campaignfinance
reports that detail the millions of dollars that PACs and individuals
spend to influence Congress. But what they don't know is that the
American Medical Association---whose PAC is considered the Godfather
of PACs---is the FEC's landlord.[^4/47]

The FEC lease illustrates just how entrenched the AMA is in the nation's
capital. Not only does the AMA have one of the biggest-spending
PACs in the country, but it also owns the building that houses the only
federal agency charged with monitoring PACs and campaign contributions.
It is part of the quiet but effective power of the AMA that it has
never publicized the arrangement with the FEC. True power rarely advertises
itself.

The AMA paid a 33 percent markup when it purchased the PEPCO
building in July 1981 for $13.3 million from a partnership that had just
bought it in January. The D.C. real estate market was hot, and the AMA
was gambling that the value of the building would continue to escalate: it
was next to the block that investors planned to turn into a new Federal
Triangle office complex, around the corner from the historic Ford Theater,
and across the street from the FBI's new headquarters.

The University of the District of Columbia occupied the building, a
nine-story masonry structure built in 1931 as the headquarters of the
Potomac Electric Co. But the AMA announced it would not renew
the university's lease when it expired in 1982. Instead, it would renovate
the building and seek new tenants.

Meanwhile, the FEC in 1983 began contemplating a move from its
cramped quarters at 1325 K Street NW, in Franklin Square North. Its
lease was up in 1985, and for advice it contacted the General Services Administration,
the federal agency that handles real estate for the government.
The GSA hired a consulting firm to review the FEC's needs, and
the firm reported that its office was not only inadequate, but that it was
unsafe---the thirteen-story building had no sprinklers and only two fire
escapes, prompting the FEC to consider buying emergency rope ladders.

On March 1, 1984, the FEC commissioners voted 6--0 to relocate.
Lee Ann Elliott, at the time the FEC chairman and head of the FEC's
site-search committee, initiated the lengthy bureaucratic process for a relocation
by making a formal request to the GSA. By May the FEC had
drawn up forty-three pages of specifications for the new space, including
a preference for its location: four blocks from a Metro stop, five blocks
from Franklin Square, and within an area in Northwest Washington. In
September the GSA advertised forbids.

By the end of the month, GSA had received at least three bids. FEC
staff director John C. Surina wrote a memo saying the GSA was, "contrary
to normal procedures," inviting the FEC's search committee and
consultant to tour the sites to speed up the process.[^4/48] In an interview
later, however, William B. Jenkins, at the time overseeing the relocation
as director of the GSA real estate division for the Washington, D.C., area,
said there was nothing unusual about the tour. Commissioners Elliott
and Joan D. Aikens, along with three staffers and a consultant, visited the
three original and a last-minute fourth site.

After the tour, the AMA-owned PEPCO building stood out as the favorite
of the FEC staff and search committee. The other sites had major
flaws, the committee decided. On March 1, 1985, a year to the day after
they voted to relocate, the commissioners voted 6--0 to move into the
PEPCO building. In July the GSA signed a ten-year lease, with a starting
base annual rent of $1.68 million. In a letter to Jenkins, Surina wrote, "In
all likelihood, 999 E Street will be the permanent home of the agency."[^4/49]

FEC and GSA officials describe the FEC's selection of an AMAowned
building as a coincidence in an otherwise routine process. Elliott,
in an interiew, said she had no contact with the AMA during the search,
and didn't learn that it owned the building until July or August 1985, after
the lease was signed. She said her reaction upon learning about it was:
"How about that." She added, "I didn't pay much attention to that after
that. It didn't matter to me."

Surina said he and the staff also did not learn about the AMA's
ownership until after the lease was signed. He stressed that the FEC was
one step removed from the process. The GSA acted as the agent for the
FEC, he said. Had the FEC been directly handling its own lease search, it
may not have selected a building owned by the sponsor of one of the
country's largest PACs, Surina said. Referring to the appearance left by
the arrangement, he said, "It might have been a factor had we been our
own agent."

The purchase, renovation, and leasing of the old PEPCO building
turned out to be one of the AMA's better investments. The AMA added
to its building's profitability with another highly successful attraction: a
trendy Hard Rock Cafe. The AMA also leased space to the Bureau of
Public Debt, a part of the Treasury Department that manages financial
transactions related to the federal debt. Together the FEC and the Bureau
pay more than $3 million in rent to the AMA each year.

Meanwhile, the AMA was weighing the future of its new Washington
headquarters at 1101 Vermont Avenue NW. The D.C. real estate market
was still hot, and foreign investors were buying up"trophy" properties at
unbelievably high prices. A Japanese real estate firm made a $35 million
offer to the AMA for its D.C. headquarters, which would give the AMA a
$17 million profit. The deal would allow the AMA to keep its name on
the building's façade, and the lobbyists and PAC staff to work out of its
top floors. So, three years after its great fanfare about erecting a building
to establish a permanent presence in Washington, the AMA sold it to the
highest bidder.

### Playing Hardball

AMPAC celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary in 1986 by breaking its
own record by spending $5.4 million during the two-year election cycle,
almost $2 million more than it had for the previous election, which also
had been a record-breaker. But AMPAC was not satisfied with simply
spreading money around to help incumbents, as it normally did. This
time, said AMPAC's tough-talking chairman, Dr. Thomas R. Berglund,
AMPAC would play hardball.[^4/50]

Of the four health subcommittees in Congress, the one that matters
the most is part of the powerful, tax-writing Ways and Means Committee
in the House. When the AMA first set up AMPAC, it channeled much of
its money into the conservatives on that panel. It was the Ways and Means
Committee of Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) who created Medicare
and tried but failed to craft a compromise national health insurance
system in 1974. In 1978 it was the Ways and Means health subcommittee
chairman who suggested to hospitals and the AMA that they come up
with a voluntary alternative to Carter's plan.

When the iconoclastic Representative Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.) became
chairman of the Ways and Means health panel in 1982, the AMA
figured out quickly he was no friend of theirs. During the four years he
ran the powerful panel, Jacobs managed to infuriate the AMA. He
pushed a fee freeze and a limited-payment plan for doctors under Medicare.
The thin-skinned AMA doctors also objected to his glibness. He
publicly joked about AMPAC's attempt to give him a campaign contribution
after he beat the candidate AMPAC had supported. And, noting that
the AMA was lobbying against his Medicare bill while seniors were pushing
for it, Jacobs told House members, "Vote for the canes, not for the
stethoscopes."

Meanwhile, in 1985, during the shifting in committee posts that
comes after elections, Representative Fortney "Pete" Stark (D-Calif.) took
over the chairmanship of the Ways and Means health panel from Jacobs.
A liberal Democrat and former banker, Stark had showed no interest in
Medicare or health-system matters before. But he quickly took to the
subject and immediately employed his sharp tongue to infuriate the
AMA. He routinely called doctors "rich," "reactionary," and "greedy."
But all seem to agree it was one comment that ticked off the AMA the
most: Stark referred to AMA members as "troglodytes." That is, cavemen.

For the AMA and AMPAC, playing hardball meant launching the
most expensive and controversial "shadow campaign," or use of independent
expenditures, ever conducted in a congressional race. In July
1986 the first vestiges of AMPAC's "shadow campaign" in Stark's East Bay
district showed up: a series of twenty-nine billboards promoting the
Republican challenger. AMPAC had found its champion in David M.
Williams, the fifty-year-old owner of a package engineering firm.
Williams was a political neophyte, but AMPAC officials had decided he
was their man.

Stark quickly made AMPAC the issue in his campaign. After the billboards
started showing up, he again called doctors "greedy" and said
they had targeted him for defeat because "they've never met anybody before
who wasn't scared of them." As election day neared, Stark's attacks
on the AMA and its PAC dominated the race. Williams, his opponent,
complained, "This campaign has come down to Stark calling the AMA
greedy cavemen, and the AMA putting up signs for me."

The Williams campaign itself was woefully underfunded. The California
Republican state party gave it nothing, and the National Republican
Congressional Committee contributed a total of $16.86. Williams
loaned $14,000 of his own money to his campaign. He said he would accept
no PAC funds and would return checks from corporations. His fund
raised a total of $63,000. Yet more than half of that came from contributors
responding to an AMPAC solicitation sent to its 57,000 members, a
practice known as bundling.

AMPAC spent four times as much on its shadow campaign as Williams
did. Before it was over, AMPAC eventually sank $252,199 into
billboards, benchmark surveys, tracking polls, radio ads, direct mail,
flyers, opposition research, and consultants. But even though Stark
was a former board member of the anti-PAC Common Cause, he had
become a seven-term congressman in part by accepting PAC money. In
the 1986 election he raised $566,000 and spent most of it countering
AMPAC.

Meanwhile, in Indianapolis Jacobs noticed similar footprints left by
AMPAC. There, AMPAC found its challenger in James P. Eynon, a fortyyear-old
real estate manager. Also a political newcomer, Eynon at least
had the savvy to raise more than $500,000 in campaign funds. AMPAC
gave $6,000 to Eynon's treasury and independently spent another
$315,838 on a media blitz, polls, and consultants. The amount AMPAC
spent on the shadow campaign against Jacobs set a record for independent
expenditures in a single race. And the combined resources of
AMPAC and Eynon outspent Jacobs by a margin of 20 to 1. Jacobs raised
$52,000 and spent about $40,500. But Jacobs, too, had made the AMA
and AMPAC the major campaign issue. Eynon later complained, "The
AMA entry was the major focus of the race."

In the end, AMPAC's highly visible spending backfired. Stark won
with 70 percent of the vote, Jacobs with 58 percent. AMPAC had spent
$1.5 million independently on fourteen races in the 1986 elections, and
came up with an even split, winning seven and losing seven. Again,
AMPAC's strength of having nearly unlimited funds had been turned
back on it, handing the AMA a defeat instead of a victory.

### Stark Reaction

But the AMA lost more than its bet on the election. It had enraged one of
the most powerful members in Congress who would be in charge of issues
crucial to AMA members, notably Medicare and physician payment.
As Stark fought back, the AMAs attempts to intimidate him, or even send
a warning to marginal candidates, loomed larger and larger as a miscalculation.

Stark immediately filed a complaint with the FEC, charging that
AMPAC and the Williams campaign had been in contact, and that
AMPAC's shadow campaign was therefore not based on independent
spending. And he went on the attack against FEC commissioner Lee Ann
Elliott, urging her to remove herself from the proceedings on his complaint
because of her long history with the AMA. Stark pointed out she
still received an annual pension from the AMA.

But after getting clearance from the FEC's attorneys, Elliott rejected
Stark's request. The FEC staff reviewed Stark's complaint and recommended
that some charges be investigated. But the matter required an
FEC vote. The commissioners split the vote: three Democrats voted to
investigate, three Republicans voted to drop it. The FEC requires four
votes to take action. The AMA was off the hook.

By now Stark was so angry that he sued the FEC and Elliott, but the
judge dismissed the case. Stark even showed up at Elliott's confirmation
hearing in 1987 for a second six-year appointment to argue that she be
denied a return to the FEC. He said she had a conflict of interest. She
denied it. The Senate subcommittee approved her reappointment.

The AMA had made an irritant into an enemy. And he was a powerful
enemy. Since the 1986 election, Stark has helped write and shape
landmark Medicare bills and other legislation that was crucial to the
AMA. To help him understand the effects of proposals being considered,
he invited experts and those affected to testify before his subcommittee---except,
that is, the AMA.

## Too Much Money

University of Southern California professor Herbert E. Alexander, who
has studied PACs for longer than any other political scientist, has a theory
about why AMPAC pursued its disastrous policy on independent expenditures
in 1986. "First, they wanted to scare some people who were
not favorable to their viewpoint," he said. But it had so much money in its
treasury, it had to do something with it.

"AMPAC has had so much money that it has a hard time distributing
it," he said. "In dealing with Congress, for example, you'll find that if you
look at the figures through the FEC and other ways, every two years they
give to several hundred candidates. ... They make contributions very
liberally. Part of the reason is that they are flooded with money." He
added, "They can't stand to have a cash balance at the end of an election
year. They have to spend it, because if they don't they can't go so readily
back to their members to ask for more."[^4/51]

In 1988 AMPAC's membership fell off for the first time in many
years. And the political action committee's new chairman, Dr. Joseph
Hatch, the brother of conservative Utah Republican senator Orrin G.
Hatch, announced that AMPAC no longer would go tilting against the
windmills of secure legislators, even if they were hostile to the AMA.
AMPAC was drawing in its claws. For the 1988 elections, AMPAC slightly
increased direct contributions to candidates, but cut nearly in half the
amount it spent on shadow campaigns, though it still made the second
largest direct contributions to candidates of any of the nation's PACs. But
the AMA went back to its policy of supporting friendly incumbents.

Its huge reserves of cash turned AMPAC into a cash-rich gambler
looking for close exciting races on which to bet. In some cases the AMA
poured money into obscure House districts simply because there was a
contest with an open seat---a rarity in Congress, where most politicians
have a lock on their jobs.

For example, AMPAC in 1988 spent $131,560 in independent expenditures
to help elect Democrat Bill Sarpalius, a public-school teacher
and agricultural consultant, to Congress from the 13th District of Texas.
Sarpalius, a conservative who had served for eight years in the thirtyone-member
state Senate, hails from Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle.
No expert on health, his real interest lies in agriculture, a mainstay of his
district.

Phil Duncan, Sarpalius' chief of staff, offered an explanation for the
AMA's large outlay: it was an open seat, and Sarpalius was "a proven
quantity." Duncan explained, "He has always received significant contributions
from the AMA, going back to his Texas state senate days. He had
been a friend in the Texas state Legislature. He's someone who's voted
very conservatively on issues that mattered to docs."

Duncan, who worked for former House Majority Leader Jim Wright
for eight years, added that AMA lobbyists are among the most effective.
"They have built up a lot of goodwill with this sort of thing," he said of
AMPAC's independent expenditures, adding that AMPAC should help
AMA lobbyists during the battle over health-care reform. "They are at
least going to get a hearing in a lot of offices."[^4/52]

## UPPING THE ANTE

The AMA and AMPAC are no longer the lone Voice of Medicine in
Washington. As the pressures for health-care reform began building
during the 1980s, the number of competing specialty medical associations
and health-related organizations proliferated. Two of the AMA's
main rivals for influence in Washington, the primarily clinical and educational
American College of Surgeons and the American College of Physicians,
opened offices in Washington, though neither set up a political
action committee.

Yet there was an explosion of health PACs plying Congress with
money. The number zoomed from around 65 in 1980 to more than 150 a
decade later. And although AMPAC kept upping the ante in its spending
and contributions each election cycle, it found that it accounted for a
smaller share of the political-health dollar. In 1980 AMPAC contributions
represented more than 43 percent of all health PAC contributions.
A decade later its share had dropped by half, to 22 percent.[^4/53]

But the AMA insists it still has clout in Washington with policymakers,
and has cited a survey of 152 senior congressional staff people
that rated the AMA as one of the top five most effective lobbying groups
in the country. In his last address as the AMA's top executive, Sammons
defended the AMA he had built and its power: "We're still the Big Dog on
the policy block."

Indeed, the AMA is still the biggest. The FEC ranked AMPAC as the
biggest-spending PAC in the 1992 election cycle, with $6.3 million in expenditures.
Common Cause called AMPAC the largest contributor to
campaigns of all health PACs for handing out $12.6 million to both winning
and losing candidates from January 1, 1983, through May 31,
1993,[^4/54] The next-largest contributor donated half the amount given by
the AMA.

As large as those figures may appear, they actually understate the
investment the AMA and AMPAC has made in the current Congress,
the one that will decide the future of health-care reform. Special interests
such as the AMA have several ways to funnel money to politicians.
The three best-known are 1) direct contributions to campaign funds,
2) through the old system, since modified, of honoraria, in which a group
could give a fee to a politician for making a speech or dropping by for a
visit, and 3) independent expenditures.
3)
Our analysis of these three types of special-interest giving to current
members of Congress shows that from 1975 through the end of 1992,
the AMA and AMPAC have invested $11.4 million. For each of the 443
who took money from the AMA or AMPAC, that averages about $25,000.

Of course, AMPAC has invested about $10,000 more in each of the
thirty-five members who serve on the two House health subcommittees,
as well as in the nineteen senators on the Senate Finance Committee.
And the AMA's best hope in Congress, as always, lies with the Republicans.
AMPAC invested an average of about $32,000 in each of 188 Republicans
in the House and Senate, compared with about $21,000 into
the 251 Democrats.

AMPAC's biggest investment, $318,085, is in Representative Vic
Fazio (D-Calif.), the chairman of the fund-raising Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee. It committed $255,085 to a shadow
campaign in the 1992 election to help him squeak by with 52 percent of
the vote. Having survived, Fazio returned to Congress and served as
chairman of Hillary Rodham Clinton's massive health-care task force.

Its second largest investment, $248,108, is in Senator Bob Packwood
(R-Ore.). AMPAC independently spent $277,808 in 1992 on television
ads, polling and other aids to help Packwood, who was accused of sexually
harassing several former female staff members. Packwood has long been
influential on health issues, and sits on the Senate Finance Committee.

The others in whom AMPAC has invested more than $100,000 are
newcomer Representative Scott McInnis (R-Colo.), $194,910; Senator
Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.), $171,327; Representative Bill Sarpalius
(D-Tex.), $162,560; Senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), $158,463; Representative
Michael A. Andrews (D-Tex.), $157,023; Representative David E.
Skaggs (D-Colo.), $149,180; Representative James V. Hansen (R-Utah),
$127,859; Representative Mike Parker (D-Miss.), $118,151, and Representative
Tim Johnson (D-S.D.), $103,309.[^4/55]

The analysis also shows that the AMA or AMPAC has handed a check
at some time to 83 percent of the 535 representatives and senators. Of
those who have not received AMA or AMPAC funds, more than threequarters
either won office for the first time in 1992 or 1993, or do not
take contributions from PACs. That leaves just twenty-one senators and
representatives, such as Senators Edward Kennedy and John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, who are just too liberal or too antagonistic for AMPAC to
donate money to them.

The AMA has even reached out to its nemesis, Pete Stark. In 1992 it
invited him to Chicago to appear on a panel about the future of health
care in America. It also gave him an in-kind contribution of a dated poll
recorded at $2,000 but worth much more, and a direct contribution of
$4,000. Stark acknowledged the contribution in an interview and said,
"I'll take money from anyone." The AMA paid the way for one of Stark's
health-panel aides and other congressional staffers to a world-famous
resort in West Virginia to discuss health-care reform.[^4/56] Money may not
buy votes, or sway legislators, but it certainly can buy access.

Meanwhile, the AMA upped the stakes again in 1993 as the drive for
health-care reform shifted into higher gear. All health-care PACs poured
money into Congress, but none spent as much as AMPAC, according to
groups keeping track. In the first six months of 1993, AMPAC more than
doubled the amount it spent in the same period in 1991. Although 1993
was not an election year, AMPAC made contributions totaling $210,000
from January to June. And its officials made clear that there was more
where that came from.


[^4/0]: In addition to other sources listed, interviews were conducted with Herbert E. Alexander,
professor, University of Southern California; Lee Ann Elliott, commissioner of the Federal
Election Commission; Brooks Jackson, reporter, CNN; William B. Jenkins, former director
of the Washington regional office of the General Services Administration; author Larry
Sabato; John C. Surina, staff director of the Federal Election Commission; and Representative
Fortney "Pete" Stark (D-Calif.). Art Golab helped research parts of this chapter. The
AMA and AMPAC declined to make an official spokesperson available for this topic.

[^4/1]: The AMA declined to divulge a total for its political activities, so the $100 million figure is
a conservative estimate derived through the following method. AMA financial statements
for 1970--73 show expenses of $3.7 million ($982,000 in 1973 alone) for its Washington
office. Statements for 1974 forward omit the amount, so we estimated $1 million a year for
1974 through 1983, or $10 million. AMA budgets for 1984--90 earmarked $55.1 million for
federal and state legislation, Washington, D.C., activities, and political education. The budgets
for 1991 forward do not detail political activities, but the AMA says it spent $8.7 million
on its Washington office alone in 1993. So we estimated $10 million a year for 1991--93, or
$30 million. Altogether, the estimate totals $98.8 million
