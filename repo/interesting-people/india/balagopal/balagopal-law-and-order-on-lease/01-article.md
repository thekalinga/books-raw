Privatisation of one kind --- the opening
up of the economy to foreign and native
private capital --- is very much in the news today.
It is being discussed, admired, derided
and condemned, and either way it is Rajiv
Gandhi and his man Pitroda who are being
held responsible for it. But it appears that
the spirit of _laissez-faire_ has infected the
world in this, the late part of the twentieth
century, and Pitroda alone cannot be blamed
for it; witness the ridiculous naïveté with
which Gorbachev is rediscovering the virtues
of the market; or witness our own N T Rama
Rao.

An advertisement, designed to look like
a circus poster, was put in by the government
of Andhra Pradesh in the _Indian Express_
dated April 29 (see quote). The policy, whose
philosophical masthead proclaims that "to
an extremist a weapon implies destruction;
to a law-abiding citizen, a means of protection"
and whose objective is to "ensure that
individuals defend themselves, their families
and their villages" from 'anti-social elements',
envisages the setting up of a village Self-Protection
Committee (_Grama Swayam
Samrakshana Samiti_) consisting of five individuals
in each village. They will be chosen
by the government on the basis of education,
integrity, moral character and commitment
to social service. One position, however, is
reserved for women, scheduled castes, scheduled
tribes and minorities (put together!).
The president and vice-president of the committee
will be given licences to purchase and
hold arms (which automatically rules out
any poor person, even if education and integrity
do not: the cheapest revolver costs
Rs 12,000). The duties of the committee are

(a) to keep vigil on the activities of those
who violate excise and commercial tax laws
and indulge in offences relating to forests,
civil supplies, etc, and report them to higher
authorities;
(b) to patrol the village to prevent
the commission of offences;
(c) to assist
the police in the apprehension of offenders
and in the prevention of crime; and
(d) to
pass on information to the police about the
occurrence of any crime, or any apprehension
of breach of peace.

Separated from its preamble the policy can
only seem to be a gratuitous condemnation
of the Andhra Pradesh police, for it reads
like an SOS to the citizens to save themselves
from the inefficacy of the police. The preamble
is a story by itself, however. It goes back
to the days when the Congress ruled the
Telugu people; when political leaders and
police officers frequently mooted the idea
of forming village 'self-protection' committees
against the _naxalites_. With the evolution
of the Congress as an opposition party
--- which must need be more loyal to the ruling
classes than the party in power, for it has
a failure to live down --- a competitive
clamour was set up, and joined on occasion
by the lesser parties in the assembly, in particular
the BJP and the CPI(M). From the
year 1985 --- when the current brutal repression
on the CPI(ML) groups began --- there
have been many inconclusive debates in the
assembly about the necessity, advisability
and constitutionality of such committees.
Perhaps none of them was very serious, and
the discussion was only meant as an act of
faith on behalf of their constituents, for all
the violence that they wanted to be perpetrated
was being perpetrated anyway. Without
the need of any declared official policy,
landlords --- especially in the _Velama_-dominated
taluks of Karimnagar --- were given
liberal arms licences, and have been using
them liberally against the masses and their
activists. And more importantly the police
have always been there, supplied with arms
and infrastructure of increasing sophistication
and a licence that is increasingly free.
No formal policy or structure of Village 'self-protection'
was felt necessary then, for more
than one reason: anything done to suppress
'extremism' was in any case legitimate in the
eyes of articulate public opinion, and there
was no need to borrow the statutory legitimacy
that comes with a formal structure or
the ideological legitimacy of protecting 'self,
family and village'; secondly, the armed
strength of the enemy in those days consisted
mainly of poor peasant youth carrying the
most archaic weapons imaginable (and even
taking pride in that), and it is only now that
the transmutation to a better organised,
better equipped and ruthlessly efficient force
is taking place; thirdly, in those days the
'problem', though by no means very slight,
was nevertheless not yet a problem for the
most articulate and influential sections of
the regional elite, being confined mainly to
landlords of pre-green revolution vintage
plus forest contractors, and though the
awareness that it _could_ spread to other areas
if unattended to was there, not much urgency
was attached to it; and fourthly, the 'problem'
was as yet not compounded by a generalised
increase in the self-assertion of the
poor, or the decreasing possibility of
democratic governance, or the increasing
intra-ruling class violence.

In other words, what has given operational
seriousness to the decade-old demand
for arming 'villages' against _naxalites_ is a
combination of better organised strength of
the _naxalites_, and a certain generalisation of
the problem. The generalisation consists of
three dimensions. One, the growing tendency
of the poor even in areas not 'infected by
extremism' to resist oppression, in some
cases without any conceptualised identity,
and in some cases with a '_dalit_' identity; two,
the growing need to generally suppress the
poor, partly as an aspect of the ongoing
fascisation of the Indian polity, partly as a
necessary concomitant of the consolidation
and entrenchment of the power of diverse
sections of the ruling classes in conflict with
each other, and partly as an inevitable consequence
of the severe economic crisis which
makes it impossible to meet the slightest of
their aspirations; and three, the replacement
of political manipulation, accommodation
and appeasement with violence in the internal
squabbles of the propertied classes.

# IMMEDIATE PROVOCATION

The immediate provocation for the recent
decision, a murder that took place at Karamchedu
on the night of April 6, testifies to
all these dimensions. The victim was
Daggubati Chenchuramaiah, father of
NTR's currently most influential son-in-law,
D Venkateswara Rao. A group of unfamiliar
youth accosted him at his home, on the plea
of seeking his help in getting a job, and after
coming close to him, shot him dead pointblank
and went away shouting pro-_naxalite_
slogans. They have neither been identified
nor apprehended till now, but a new (probably
non-existent) _dalit_ organisation immediately
claimed responsibility for the
murder, and said that it was done in retaliation
to the _Karamchedu killing_ of July 17, 1985.
But a day later, a statement issued by
the _People's War_ group of CPI(ML) claimed
that it was _they_ who were responsible for
the deed.

The killing occasioned more surprise than
shock, for the _AP Dalit Mahasabha_, which
has been spearheading the protest movement
of the victims of Karamchedu --- and has
filed a private complaint implicating
Chenchuramaiah as the first accused --- is an
organisation avowedly disinclined to
violence, and none of the _naxalites_ have ever
had more than a nominal presence in the
area. Nevertheless the administration has
reacted with uncharacteristic calm. It knows
perfectly well that whoever may have been
the killers, and however limited their local
mass base, any hasty action in retaliation
would have unpleasant consequences. The
_Karamchedu killing_ was followed by such a
tardy investigation and such an unsatisfactory
charge-sheet that the _Dalit Mahasabha_
was forced to file a private complaint implicating
all the influential and powerful persons
left out in the police charge-sheet.
Nearly four years later, the trial is yet to
start. It has been delayed by such vexatious
means that it would be tiresome to recapitulate
them. Meanwhile, the killings have
continued. Neerukonda (Guntur district),
Dontali (Nellore district), Gudiada
(Vizianagaram district), Bandlapalli
(Chittoor district), Kollipara (Guntur
district) and Jabbargudem (Ranga Reddy
district) are villages where fatal assaults on
_dalits_ have taken place after Karamchedu.
In most of these cases, behind the seemingly
local tensions of wages, land and electoral
conflict can be clearly discerned a certain
process of consolidation and entrenchment
of the land-and-business-based regional elite,
whose political strategy is to consolidate an
obedient village community behind it in its
struggle with monopoly capital. This
murderous polities has created such an aversion
among the democratic masses that even
ruling class spokespersons are vary of expressing
anything more than a routine shock
and condemnation of Chenchuramaiah's
murder.

The fact that the murder was avowedly
committed by a _naxalite_ group came in handy
for NTR. This is perhaps the first murder
in many years committed by any _naxalite_
group in the paddy-tobacco-cotton belt of
coastal Andhra, the social hinterland of
NTR's politics, and the victim was not
anybody but a close relative-by-marriage of
the chief minister. The murder has undoubtedly
given a much-needed shock to the
landed gentry of coastal Andhra, who have
been continuing their assaults on the poor
in utter contempt of all peaceful protest. On
the other hand, if the killers had not been
_naxalites_, it is doubtful that NTR would have
found it possible to make an excuse of it to
formulate a policy of creating armed 'self-defence'
squads constituted by persons
chosen by the government, and if he did he
would have found it difficult to legitimise
it. Now he can do it in the name of 'extremist
violence', for the killing of poor people
in the name of curbing 'extremism' has
long been legitimised in this state, and even
those who are otherwise democratic do not
protest much about it: NTR after coming to
power, has already killed about 180 _naxalite_
cadre and sympathisers in 'encounters',
almost all of them peasant or tribal youth,
and very few people have spoken out against
this record. This pre-existing legitimacy he
can now use to justify his policy of arming
dominant landholders with fire-arms and
policing powers, an act that can have
devastating consequences for the oppressed
classes, especially outside the 'extremist-infested'
north Telangana districts, for outside
these five districts the resistance of the
poor is in no position to take on armed attacks
from the landlords. But since control
of the rural masses is an essential part of
NTR's politics, he must be only too happy
that he can legitimately proceed with the
scheme.

Along a different political dimension, the
landlords of the north Telangana districts are
also in dire need of more arms to fight the
_naxalites_ whose strength is, by all accounts,
increasing in spite of the endless 'encounter'
killings; and NTR has no doubt been wistfully
admiring licentious Bihar, where the
government is free to allow landlords to
maintain their own private armies. Presumably
now some of the landlords of
Warangal and Karimnagar will form themselves
into village 'self-protection' committees
and inflict violence upon the peasants and
labourers. But the principal agency of _anti-naxalite_
operations will however continue to
be the special police, recently consolidated
as a _Special Task Force_ armed with anonymity
and automatic weapons and commanded
by the most notorious and powerful policeman
in the state, deputy inspector general
of police, K S Vyas. The kind of arms and
organisation the _naxalite_ groups have built
up in the recent years put them beyond the
range of private armies.

# CONGRESS RESPONSE

The Congressmen have a very different
reason for being upset over NTR's scheme.
The Congress is at present engaged in a
serious conflict with parties like _Telugu
Desam_ in attracting to itself the loyalty of
the rural rich. It is a vulgar understanding
that sees the Congress as a representative of
monopoly capital as against parties like TDP
which represent the regional elite. Whichever
class may at present dominate this or that
political formation, and whatever may be the
self-perceptions of those classes and formations,
the fact is that the Congress represents
a certain paradigm, a certain model for the
resolution of the question of balancing the
interests of the various sections of the ruling
classes, and formations like TDP represent
not so much a different paradigm as a
temporary phase of self-assertion of the
regional elite in the process of consolidation
and definition of a new paradigm. While the
TDP therefore asserts the power of the rural
rich by acting as the political vehicle through
which they suppress the rural masses and
force the 'village' to fall in line behind them,
the Congress tries to attract the very same
rural rich by wooing them through measures
like the _Panchayat Raj_ Bill. In the process
violent clashes between the two formations
continue to take place, resulting in frequent
incidents of booth-capturing, rigging, rioting,
arson and murder. As the general elections
come near the violence increases in
proportion. It is against this background
that Congressmen are agitated over the
_village 'self-protection' scheme_, for as they
have been unabashedly saying, they are
afraid that all the arms licences will go to
_Telugu Desam_ men, who are going to use
them to rig the coming elections. One Congressman
from Guntur --- the district which
has seen the most violent Congress-TDP
clashes, especially in the constituency of the
previous home minister --- has even gone to
court challenging the constitutionality of the
scheme.

The court will probably hold the scheme
unconstitutional, at least in its present form.
Self-defence as an exceptional plea taken by
a person who has caused injury to another
is recognised by law, but that is a very different
thing from the state going around forming
armed squads of persons chosen by it
and delegating policing powers to them.
NTR bemoans that in the good old days
villages used to have 'self-protection' committees
consisting of respectable inhabitants, a
habit that has unaccountably died out in recent
times, and hence claims in justification
of his scheme that he is only reviving an
ancient institution. But in the meanwhile,
to NTR's misfortune, we have acquired a
modern constitution and rudimentary notions
of _Rule of Law_, which must need be formally
adhered to. And quite apart from the fact
that persons of "good conduct, education,
integrity and commitment to social service"
who are supplied with enough cash to purchase
a revolver withal can only come from
the landholding classes, it is doubtful that
Article 21 as it is presently interpreted will
accept the leasing out of the job of policing
to private parties --- rich or poor. Informing
the police and keeping vigil over the violation
of excise and civil supplies laws is
alright, and no smuggler has ever been hurt
by vigilance in any case, but the power to
patrol the village with arms to prevent the
commission of offences is a different thing
altogether. On the one hand, and as it is,
most of the offences the official police commit
are during the purported prevention of
other people's offences, and secondly the
term 'offence' as classified by the _Indian
Penal Code_ and other penal laws is a
dangerously vague thing. A landlord given
policing powers may very well decide that
it is breach of peace if his labourers strike
work and _gherao_ him, and may set about
preventing it with fire-arms. Or a poor
woman gathering firewood from the village
wasteland, a peasant catching fish in a tank
or stream auctioned by the _gram panchayat_
to a contractor, a landless family ploughing
unused common land or putting up a hut
on it, peasants abusing a corrupt revenue
official or belabouring an extortionate electricity
supervisor, are all guilty of offences
like theft, encroachment, intimidation and
assault; imagine the consequence of giving
the rural gentry fire-arms licences and the
authority to prevent such 'offences' and
apprehend the offenders!
