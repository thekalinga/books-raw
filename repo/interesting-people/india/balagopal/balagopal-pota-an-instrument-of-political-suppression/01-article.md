The arrest of the MDMK leader Vaigo under _POTA_[^pota] is an indication simultaneously of the
intention of those who wanted to have that law, and the nature of that law: it was meant to be
used as a political instrument, and it is shaped ideally for such use. It cannot be said too often
that no terrorist to date has invented any new offence that was not imagined by the framers of the
_Indian Penal Code_. All that has been achieved is newer and more brutally effective ways of
committing the same old offences. And even this was first discovered, not by any terrorist, but
by the legitimate forces of the law-making State. This is not meant as a justification of arbitrary
acts of violence against common people that are universally abhorred as _acts of terrorism_, but to
put things in right perspective: the terrorists have learnt the brutal trade they practice from the
forces of _law and order_.

[^pota]: Prevention of Terrorists Act. One in a series of anti-civil rights draconian legislations passed by Indian Govt under the guise of tackling terrorism whose objective is to suppress political dissent & to jail workers, tribals & citizens who oppose privatisation of public resources.

A new law to deal with 'terrorist offences' was therefore not required, since there are no new
offences invented by terrorists. A new law was needed for a reason that springs, not from any
novelty in the offences called _terrorist_, but from the fact that terrorism is not just another offence,
but a _political offence_, or more precisely an offence arising from politics unpalatable to the
current rulers.

If the offence is all that is to be controlled or suppressed, the existing penal law is about as
sufficient as any penal law can ever be. It can never be fully successful, because the law can
never be fully successful in eliminating crime. But penal law as we know it is about as successful
as law can be. But in dealing with _political offences_, the view of the establishments the world
over is that the _politics_ must be suppressed if the offences are to be controlled. But this
suppression must be done in the name of controlling crime and not politics, since democracy as
understood in the civilised world does not permit straight forward suppression of politics. This is
why _POTA_ was needed. And once this is understood, all hypocrisy must cease.

Journalists made much of _Sec 3(8)_ of the first _ordinance_ preceding _POTA_, and got it deleted in
the second _ordinance_ and the Act. There is a feeling in the Press that journalists are no longer
vulnerable. How much of an illusion this could turn out to be would depend on how the police
are going to interpret and use the other dubious provisions of the Act which may well substitute
for _Sec 3(8)_, namely _Secs 3(3)_ and _3(4)_. But _Sec 21_, under which Vaigo has been booked, can be
used with ease against not only serious ideological support but even mere intellectual dalliance
with what the Act defines as _terrorist organisations_. And this is no less bad than booking
journalists under _POTA_ for doing their job. To invite support for a terrorist organisation, to
arrange or manage a meeting to support or to further the activities of a terrorist organisation, or a
meeting to be addressed by a person who professes to belong to a terrorist organisation, or to
oneself address such a meeting is an offence punishable with ten years imprisonment under _Sec 21_.
Here, it is not support for an act of violence that is being penalised, but support for a
'_terrorist organisation_', which may well be merely political support or sympathy.

Public pronouncements in support of the politics of unfavoured militancy, even if there is no
immediate or even long distance nexus with acts of violence, are proscribed on pain of a ten-year
punishment under _Sec 21_. This is a clear assault of the _freedom of political belief_ (and let us
remember before anyone works up a blood pressure about this comment, that _freedom of
political belief_ includes the _freedom of wrong belief_, for the simple reason that all of us will
never agree on what is _right political belief_).

Vaigo, it is said, expressed appreciation of the _LTTE_[^ltte] in a public meeting held in Tirumangalam
in Tamil Nadu. He himself explained that he had said that:

(i) the Tamils were facing serious
problems of discrimination in Sri Lanka, and
(ii) that the _LTTE_ was putting up a just fight for
their rights.

[^ltte]: The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), commonly known as the Tamil Tigers, were a separatist militant organization fighting for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka's Tamil minority in northern Sri Lanka. Velupillai Prabhakaran founded the group in 1972 and by the late 1980s was the dominant Tamil militant group in Sri Lanka.

It is not Jayalalitha's case that Vaigo killed someone, or blew up a Bank, or
committed dacoity, while saying this. He merely said this. Can any civilised nation punish a
person for merely expressing such a view? It appears that this nation can.

Apart from the _right to say wrong things_, there are many in Tamil Nadu as well as outside who
do not care much for the brutal character of the _LTTE_ and its authoritarian ways, but would
nevertheless agree with these two points. Jayalalitha may disagree with them. And so may her
good friends of the _Sangh Parivar_ in Delhi. But that is surely a matter of a _point of view_? But
_points of view_ are precisely what _Sec 21_ aims at, and so Jayalalitha has not misused _POTA_, she
has merely used it. If _Sec 21_ is used with the same consistency in Tamil Nadu, a large number of
the citizens resident in that State will have to go to jail, because that view is quite commonly
held in that State. Though, to clarify once again, no more than a minority support the _LTTE_ in all
its brutality.

Vaigo may not be a worthy icon in the struggle against _POTA_, for if one remembers rightly he
was one of that Act's most vociferous supporters in Parliament, and he believes that using it
against him is wrong but using it in Kashmir is alright. But his arrest affords a good opportunity
to debate the nature of that piece of legislation. And unworthy symbols are sometimes preferable
because one can then avoid the distracting glare that a worthy symbol would throw on the
debate. One can comfortably discuss the issue on principles, ignoring the individual. Would
India really benefit from a law that suppresses political points of view at the margin of
acceptability to the rulers? The views may be umbilically linked to strategies of violence, but is
that not all the more reason for wanting an open debate on them? The best way of showing up
the futility of violence is to exhibit the strength of the human powers of reason, which cannot be
done if one side to the debate is suppressed. If laws such as _POTA_ occupy the terrain, the politics
of dissident violence will be met exclusively by State violence minus politics. And that can never
answer militancy because it is morally not only not superior but in fact inferior to it, being the
violence in defence of status quo, as against violence in the cause of change. And moreover, the
AK-47 is no answer to any politics.
