Andhra Pradesh is one of the few States in India known for substantial presence of
Communist-led movements. It shares this distinction with West Bengal, Kerala and
Bihar. While the Parliamentary Communist parties are dominant in the first two States,
Andhra Pradesh and Bihar are known for the strong extra-Parliamentary armed
Communist movements.

The Communist parties, whether Parliamentary or armed, believe that it is their duty to
take under their wing all movements for the redressal of popular grievances. They believe
that they possess a _theory_ that can help locate each popular grievance in its appropriate
place in the social system, and thereby indicate its _objective significance_ as distinct from
(but subsuming) its _subjective significance_ for the carriers of the grievance. And that they
have the requisite organisational _theory_ to build a movement for it's redressal that will
make it part of the wider movement for social transformation i.e., the building of a
society free of exploitation. Popular movements that do not accept the leadership of the
Communists are looked upon by the Communists with suspicion, and are required to
prove strictly that they are not agents of the local or imperialist exploiting classes.

Nobody can deny that it is good from the long term view of social transformation --- and
even the immediate requirement of mutual solidarity --- that popular movements that take
up diverse grievances coordinate themselves and evolve a common orientation. Since
oppressive social groups and the institutional instruments that aid them do form a
coherent and (often) mutually reinforcing totality, though they may not be as solid a bloc
as radical analysis frequently makes them appear to be, it is necessary that struggles
against oppression also coordinate themselves as best as they can. The best way may not
necessarily be under the leadership of a single (and that too a highly centralised) party.
But nevertheless, the very necessity adds strength and legitimacy to the Communist
demand that all popular movements should merge with the political movement led by,
and find their place within the strategic scheme adopted by them.

But any such demand must exhibit a matching reciprocity: a theoretical intelligence and
practical innovativeness that will respond quickly to popular aspirations (indeed,
recognise them even while they are dormant and awaken them) and will organise the
people in such a way that the satisfaction of the grievance is attempted as part of a wider
transformative process, but at the same time the people who carry the grievance do not
feel that their aspirations are being 'used' for a strategy whose goal is either too abstract
and far off for them to identify with, or whose link with the professed goal is not self-evident.

That the Communist parties in India have lacked the practical innovativeness to attract a
large variety of movements into their fold is a known fact. This is not peculiar to India,
though it can perhaps be said that Indian Communists have exhibited, on the whole, less
than normal innovativeness. Perhaps the highly centralised nature of the _Bolshevik
model_ that has become the norm of Communist organisation is itself a hindrance to
innovativeness, while it may certainly have virtues of a military nature. But does the
Communist movement have even the necessary _theory_, or at least the requisite _capability_
for developing the necessary _theory_, for undertaking the task of attracting all the
grievances of oppressed or exploited people in society to itself?

The prospects of the Communist movement in India await an answer to this question. A
look at the recent popular movements and political trends that have surfaced in Andhra
Pradesh, by-passing all the Communist formations from the mildest to the most violent,
should indicate some answers.

What immediately strikes the eye is that ever since the birth of the _Dalit movement_ in
1985, most of the social and political movements that have come forth in Andhra Pradesh
have been outside the Communist fold. The two exceptions are the _Prisoners' struggle of
1994_ which was initiated and led by the _Naxalite_ (principally _Peoples War_) under-trials,
and the mass campaign against armed landlord factions in Rayalaseema which was taken
up by the _CPI-ML_[^cpiml] (Janashakthi). Being anti-State or anti-landlord struggles, there was no
theoretical obstacle to the taking up of these causes. What is remarkable is that all the
other movements that have come up in this period were initiated by
parties/organisations/persons other than the Communists, and all of them were either
wholly or partly of a nature other than anti-State, anti-landlord and anti-capitalist,
though none of them was pro any of these oppressive forces. The question is whether this
indicates merely lack of theoretical innovativeness and practical creativity, or some
deeper lack.

[^cpiml]: Communist Party of India-_Marxist Leninist_.

None of these non-Communist struggles has actually adopted an anti-Communist stand,
though many of them have been critical of _Communist theory and practice_. The
Communists, for their part, have exhibited a range of responses to these movements:
initial surprise that they did not know what was in the offing; followed by sometimes
hostile and sometimes mild criticism of the movements' theory and practice and
unsolicited advice about the same from the proclaimed vantage point of _scientific_ social
theory; not infrequent participation in solidarity struggles; and perpetual warning to
beware of co-optation by the ruling classes. In addition, the Communists --- and the
_Naxalites_ in particular --- never tire of claiming credit for being the first in the State to
legitimise radical questioning, and thereby paving the way for other forms of radical
questioning and activity. The claim is not without substance, but it is understandably
found oppressive by the later protest movements, for their legitimacy is simultaneously
belittled with charges of deviation, collaboration and co-optation.

Let us try to look at the reason why these later protest movements erupted outside the
Communist fold. The most talked about of these movements is the _anti-arrack_[^2] struggle of
rural women. Communist parties are parties of men, to a much greater extent than they
are parties of the _non-Dalit_ castes. For men, discussion about drink turns around the
notions of habit/morality/ practicality of prohibition/power of the liquor business in the
polity. Those who defend drinking describe it as an age-old personal habit; opposition to
it is castigated as old-fashioned morality. The opposition is justified by their critics in the
name of the popular expectation that Communists should oppose a culture of self-indulgence,
whether ancient or otherwise. And in any case (the argument finally ends)
banning drink is impractical, since it has not been successful anywhere in the world. The
growing importance of liquor business and _arrack_ contractors in Andhra Pradesh politics
was quickly noted, condemned, and its social and political consequences analysed, by the
_CPI-ML_ parties as well as _Marxist intellectuals_ (including myself). All the Communist
parties have the rural labouring population as their main stay, and all _Marxist intellectuals_
have the interests of the labouring (in particular the rural) population at heart, without
consideration of caste or sex, but yet it took an independent upsurge of women from the
very same rural classes to alter the terms of discussion and focus on the violence and
deprivation that the male addiction to drink entails for the women and the children they
rear.

[^2]: _Arrack_ is an alchoholic beverage distilled mainly from fermented palm sap, grain, fruit, molasses and
sugarcane. Is considered a very strong form of liquor.

The _CPI_ and _CPI(M)_ showed little interest in even opposing the growth of corruption
and violence in the wake of the increasing importance of _arrack_ business and _arrack_
businessmen in the State's politics. The _CPI_ because quite a few of its own leaders are
_arrack_ businessmen, and the _CPI(M)_ because of its very close links with the _Telugu
Desam Party_, which is much more than a mere electoral ally of the _Parliamentary Left_ in
the State, and which is as congenial a political habitat for liquor businessmen as the
Congress. But the _CPI-ML_ parties did take up a fight against what they understood as the
plunder of the workers by the _arrack_ contractors. The argument was that the contractor
was robbing the poor worker and taking away much of his income by selling him drink.
But the victim was often not very enthusiastic about the struggle, and therefore the
struggle in which the male drink-addicted worker was seen as the victim was either
forced into dormancy, or else it had to be taken up by terrorist means as the _Peoples War_
did: individual armed militants would physically threaten or attack the _arrack_
businessmen, burn down or blow up the shops, etc. It took a movement of the wives of
these contrived victims to show who the true victims were. The worker presumably had a
merry time getting drunk, even if that ate into his salary or wages and rendered him that
much poorer. But it was the women at home who suffered the deprivation as well as the
violence that the drunken worker inflicted upon them, as well as the added burden of
putting up with the man's irresponsible attitude towards the management of the
household. To his wife, he probably looked less like a victim and more like an accomplice
of the liquor businessman in the violence and deprivation that she suffered.

The relevant question here is this: can a theoretical outlook which is accustomed to
identifying the 'working class' with the totality of the (mostly male) workers who work
outside the home, each of whom is taken to homogeneously represent his family, arrive at
this view point without denting its theory? The _CPI-ML_ parties, in a sense, have even less
justification than the Parliamentary Communists for this blindness, for their mainstay has
been the class of landless agricultural workers, many of whom are women, but then their
_Rytu Coolie Sanghams_[^3] are practically all-male organisations for all that, and therefore
their political sense has not been substantially affected by the fact that their mainstay is
the class of landless labourers of whom (even if one counts only those who are visible in
the fields) very many are women.

[^3]: Farmers and labourers associations.

The way the _CPI-ML_ parties perceived the problem had a curious consequence. Since it
was the drink-addicted worker who was seen as the victim of the liquor business, and the
appropriation of his income by the _arrack_ businessman was seen as the issue to be fought,
the parties first fought for lowering the price of _arrack_. This rather ridiculous demand
made their intellectual sympathisers vaguely uncomfortable. But it angered the women a
lot. For it often meant that the man drank more and troubled the women at home more
with his violence and his drink-induced irresponsibility, even if he spent less in the
aggregate upon drink. The parties realised the foolishness of their struggle after a couple
of years, even if they did not comprehend the theoretical lack that had impeded their
view. In consequence, the struggle for total prohibition that they later undertook was
ineffective where it was nonviolent, and an affair of individual hit-and-run terror where
it was effective. It took a self-conscious movement of the rural women to set the
perspective right. The question is: could it have been otherwise? For that would have
meant broadening the notion of working class to include the shadowy figures of the wage
workers' family hiding behind them, and more importantly, accepting the existence of
serious conflicts of interest within the family. The theoretical resistance to this is
exemplified by the haste with which such a proposal calls up the discussion whether the
conflict of interest between men and women within patriarchy is irreconcilable or merely
a 'friendly' contradiction.

Two other movements may be examined here to make a few more observations. One is
the organised _Dalit movement_, which is in fact the first of the recent popular movements
that have bypassed the Communist parties. Individual _Ambedkarites_ and small
_Ambedkarite groups_ have existed in the State for a long time, but it was the birth of the
_Andhra Pradesh Dalit Mahasabha_ in 1985 that signalled the birth of a mass _Dalit
movement_ in the State. It began with a bang, inspiring thousands of _Dalits_ into activism
in the coastal Andhra districts. Today, the _Dalit Mahasabha_ is split and somewhat
demoralised, but _Dalit activism and consciousness_ are alive as ever. And they remain by
and large outside the Communist stream. Even among the _CPI-ML_ parties, the
_Janashakthi_ alone has tried to incorporate the _Dalit viewpoint_ to some extent in its world
view and thereby create space for _Dalit activism_ within its movement. But it is now
facing many problems in effecting this incorporation.

Why is the _Dalit movement_ outside the Communist stream? After all, it is not a
movement based on urban middle class _Dalits_, but a mass movement of _Dalits_ with a firm
foothold in the segregated settlements of the rural untouchables. These _Dalit masses_ are of
the landless worker or (at best) poor peasant classes, which classes are the main support
base of the Communists, in particular the _CPI-ML_ parties. Nor has the _Dalit movement_ in
A.P adopted a hostile attitude towards the Backward Caste labourers who share the same
class position as the _Dalits_ (though the Backward Castes themselves may have exhibited
misgivings about the organised self-assertion of the untouchables). And yet, the _Dalit
movement_ has remained at best an uncomfortable friend of even the _CPI-ML_ parties, and
at worst an unwelcome intruder suspected of consciously diverting the class struggles of
the poor. Why is this so? And did it have to be so?

It was in the coastal Andhra districts that the mass _Dalit movement_ of today started. Its
rise has revealed the presence of a ferment --- whose fundamentals were not absent in
Telangana and Rayalaseema too --- in those districts. It is evident now that a call for _Dalit
self-assertion_ based on a _Dalit identity_ would have evoked response in those districts. It is
a commonplace that it was not so evident to the Communist parties and to _Marxist
intellectuals_ (including myself) until the _Karamchedu massacre_ took place and gave birth
to a mass _Dalit movement_ in whose formation a few perceptive _Dalit intellectuals_ played
a central role. But what is the reason? The _CPI_ and _CPI(M)_ have a significant presence
in the coastal Andhra districts, but while much of their following is among the rural poor,
it is mostly a passive 'support base' mobilised for voting at election time, and for
exhibition at conference time. The local leadership of these parties, however, is mostly in
the hands of the upper caste middle or rich farmers, whose sincerity in espousing the
economic interests of the poor need not be doubted (though these days even this is
doubted by the poor), but whose understanding or tolerance of _Dalit self-assertion_ is
extremely suspect. The _CPI-ML_ parties have never had much mass base among the people
in the coastal Andhra districts. Whatever the organisational reasons for this, their view of
_mass struggles_ certainly militated against it. Theirs is a framework of militant class
struggle against feudal oppression and extreme economic exploitation. They could not
expect to get a foothold in the coastal districts where feudal domination of the Telangana
type is non-existent, and while poverty is a reality, there is little destitution. Work is
available, and wages are not inconsiderable. A movement for social respect and dignity,
and for upward mobility within the existing economy and polity, breaking the barriers of
caste, would have been possible. Since the respect and dignity were denied, and the
opportunities blocked, primarily on grounds of caste, the movement would have to be
based on the _Dalit identity_ and not the Communist notion of working class. This shift in
perception was necessary before any popular movement of the oppressed masses could
breakout in the coastal districts.

Would such a shift have been possible for the Communists, within Communist theory? A
movement for self-respect and dignity, considered as a '_super-structural_' though important
question, and limited mainly to the question of _untouchability_, would have been possible,
but it would have to be an adjunct to a 'basic' class movement. Considered by itself, it
would not have been perceived as an issue which could constitute the principal focus of
political struggle, though varying degrees of importance could be given to the
'_super-structural_' question of _untouchability_, even while it remained '_super-structural_',
depending on the sensitivity of the leadership. For it cannot be denied that Communists
have led anti-_untouchability_ struggles at various points of time. But there is a whole
world's difference between taking up the issue of _Dalit self-respect and dignity_ in the
form of only an anti-_untouchability_ campaign, and that too as an adjunct to 'class
struggle', and taking it up as a basic issue of social revolution or democratisation. The
difference becomes even clearer when we move to the second aspect of the contemporary
_Dalit movement_. That is, the struggle of _Dalits_ to break the caste barriers for their upward
mobility within the existing economy and polity. This does not by any means preclude a
critical attitude towards the existing economic and political relations, but the engagement
with this particular struggle, whether along with or independent of a struggle against the
dominant economic and political systems, is a necessary and legitimate chapter in the
struggle for social transformation. But here Communist theory meets with a basic
difficulty. There is little room in that theory for any respect for the desire to move up in
the Capitalist economy and the _bourgeois-democratic political system_. Such a desire is de-legitimised
as inherently individualist, because it is not possible for every one, and if it
finds expression within the working class, it is dubbed a _petty-bourgeois illusion_ or
weakness. While it may be tolerated in an individual, a whole political movement that
emphasises this goal (whether exclusively or along with other goals) would not be
allowed transformative legitimacy, much less engendered by Communists. Communist
theory treats the economy as the fundamental fact of social life, and the political system
as its principal _super-structural_ agent and protector. A movement that has as one of its
main goals the desire of helping a section of the toiling masses (that is what the _Dalits_ are,
for the working class view point) to move up in these spheres is incurably reformist,
illusory and _petty-bourgeois_. A cautious and tactful (or tactical) silence may be
maintained towards such movements if the situation demands, for the Communist
movement is not without its sense of _realism_ in politics, but the theoretical tension
remains. Nothing short of giving a 'basic' status to caste, at least on par with economic
relations, can resolve the problem, and then the theoretical difficulty arises as to how one
is to reconcile two 'basic' relations sitting side by side and interacting with each other,
within the _base-superstructure model_ of _Communist theory_. What this means is that
there are fundamental theoretical reasons why the Communist movement could not have
been the progenitor of the _Dalit movement_. Of course, this does not explain why the
Communist leadership could not see this theoretical difficulty and try to come to terms
with it. The reason for that is undoubtedly that much of the Communist leadership, and
much more so the _Marxist intelligentsia_, till now has been from the upper or at least the
'_Savarna_'[^4] castes, and therefore has had no personal experience of humiliation of
_untouchability_ and the social handicap of being a _Dalit_.

[^4]: Communities that belong to one of the four _Varnas_ in the Hindu _Varna system_ -- _Brahmins_, _Kshatriyas_,
_Vyshyas_ and _Sudras_. _Dalits_ and _Scheduled Tribes_ do not belong to the _Varna system_ and are considered _Avarna_ i.e without _Varna_.

# The Distinction

_Class-in-itself_ and _class-for-itself_ is familiar to _Marxist theory_. It is accepted that it is not
sufficient that the working class is constituted objectively as a class (by the relations of
production). It must feel, think and respond subjectively as a class. From 'they' it must
become 'we'. What is the reason for making this distinction? The liberation of the
working class from exploitation can only take place after the self-discovery of the
working class. It must be preceded by the workers' discovery of their own identity, and
the dignity, strength and value that proceed there-from.

The assertion of identities --- of _Dalits_, Tribals and women --- should be seen to possess
tremendous value from this point of view. Unfortunately, the Communists have in
practice been more concerned about safeguarding the objective unity of the working class
 --- to which the politics of caste, tribe and gender is seen as a hindrance --- than in
engendering a subjective sense of worth and dignity in the oppressed. Within the caste
system and within patriarchal family relations, the toiling and oppressed people are not
oppressed as 'workers' in the abstract, but as potters, dhobis or barbers, and as women.
The rediscovery of their own worth and dignity takes place most naturally therefore
through these identities.

The Women's movement, the _Dalit movement_ and the subsequent emergence of forums
of individual toiling ('backward') communities, can be seen and appreciated from this
angle. For the first time --- and after many decades of honest and dedicated Communist
organisation --- each section of the oppressed people is discovering for itself what it is and
what it can be. If Communist theory were not obsessed with the objective category of
_class_ under which all self-assertion of the oppressed must be instantly subsumed, and if it
gave significance to the more important process of self-discovery of the oppressed, it
would have learnt to see this assertion as a valuable advance. Instead, obsessed with the
theoretical category of _class_, these assertions are seen to be dominated by a micro-elite of
the _petty-bourgeoisie_ of those communities, ready to be co-opted into ruling class
politics. Of course, the question must be posed: will this assertion eventually lead to a
politics of liberation for all people from all forms of oppression? Within _Marxist theory_,
this question is rephrased as: will this assertion eventually lead to the formation of
working class consciousness? It is this rephrasing that gives rise to the perpetual unease
that afflicts Communists about the possibility of the co-optation of the 'elites' (such as they
are) of these communities by the ruling classes. But if alternative modes of realisation of
the goal of liberation from oppression can be conceived, the unease loses its seeming
objectivity. And yet critiques of the possible limitations of this politics will be available.

Even in the advanced Capitalist countries, the differentiation wrought by modern day
Capitalism within the working class, as well as the categories of gender and ethnicity that
are not reducible to class, have made the primacy of class a questionable assumption. In
Third World countries, and especially in India which has a well entrenched system of
social stratification based upon caste, capitalism is unlikely to take as comprehensive a
form as in the West, and therefore class is never likely to become even as important a
mode of being as in the West.

Two final examples will serve to illustrate the points made above.

The _Madiga_[^5] movement for categorisation of SC reservations has thrown up a question
equally for the Communists and the _Dalit organisations_. Neither of them could have
perceived the genuine grievances of the _Madigas_ even if they knew of the existence of the
disparity. For that would mean dividing a seemingly united force (the rural landless
labourers in the case of the Communists, and the _Dalits_ in the case of the _Dalit
movement_) whose united strength was the base from which an assault on the dominant
structures was to be led. It therefore required the self-assertion of the _Madigas_ to make
the movement possible. But at the end, what one finds is not only that a genuine
(sectional) demand has been realised, but that the 'section' in question is now more
conscious, more assertive, and more aware of its own dignity and worth. This should
actually be an asset for any transformative movement, but the notion of a single and
solidly united force from which an assault upon the system is to be launched seems to be
contradicted by this development.

It is true on the one hand, that total fragmentation of rebel movements into mutually
hostile or indifferent efforts would dampen the overall transformative potential of
popular movements. It is nobody's wish that it should be so. What seems to be required is
'localised' (both spatially and socially) movements that are specific enough to bring out
the full potential and engender the full self-realisation of various oppressed groups,
subsequently federated into a wider movement that can (in a free and democratic way)
channel the aroused energies into a broad movement. This is quite different from the
Leninist notion of a single _vanguard party_ that will centre all knowledge in itself and
direct (_top-down_) the struggles of the suppressed masses. In such an effort, the suppressed
masses will not be even half awakened to their potential. Even if such a party claims that
it learns from the people, and even if it honestly tries to do so, the very strategy leaves a
lack. If there can at all be a single 'party' which will lead a movement for social
transformation, it can only be a federally structured organisation, whose free and equal
units will be the basic political units, centred on the self-directed struggles of various
sections of the deprived. But as long as capture of (or smashing of) State power, and the
solid unity of the social base that it requires, is the strategic driving force of party
organisation, the federated structure that can fully release the energies of the people
cannot be realised. This contradiction is insurmountable only to the extent that 'State
power' is central to the task of social transformation. If its importance is downgraded
from the present centrality it has in _Marxist thought_, and shown a lower but appropriate
place, the contradiction can be overcome.

[^5]: _Dalit_ caste found mainly in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra.

The final example is the recent tribal struggle in West Godavari district. All the
Communist parties without exception have following among tribals in Andhra Pradesh.
All of them have led some struggles for the benefit of the tribals. A large quantity of
forest land is being enjoyed by the tribals of the State with Communist --- especially
_Naxalite_ --- help. And yet, the first major struggle against occupation of tribal land by non-tribals
has come under a totally independent leadership. Indeed, if one leaves out the
initial inspiration given by the voluntary organisation '_Shakthi_', it may be said that the
recent tribal struggle for strict implementation of the _Land Transfer Regulation Act_[^6] is a
struggle of, for and by the tribals.

[^6]: A regulation intended to regulate the transfers of land in the _Fifth Scheduled Areas_ of AP. It contains express
provisions which state that tribal land cannot be alienated to non-tribals.

The tenacity of the struggle has taken all the Communist parties by surprise. And it has
given rise to the question why the parties never succeeded in conducting an equally
tenacious struggle for protecting tribal land from encroachment by non-tribals in their
own tribal strongholds. Much of the Communist-led tribal struggle has been an anti-State
struggle, aimed at asserting the right of cultivation in State-owned forest land. This is
fully in keeping with Communist strategy centred on political struggle against the State.
It was also perhaps felt by the Communists that taking up a struggle against non-tribal
encroachers on a major scale would pit the tribals against the non-tribal poor, which
would be prejudicial to the requirement of unity of the toiling classes. The independent
tribal struggle has not been aimed at the non-tribal poor. The tribals are quite
sympathetic towards them. Yet that has not precluded a determined struggle for
restoration of land alienated from the tribals. The guarantees to the non-tribal poor would
come at the end and not at the beginning, as with a strategy of unity of the toiling masses
conceived as the solid base for an assault on the State.

But the practical upshot has been a tremendous self-assertion of the tribals; the growth of
a sense of dignity and worth; the development of leaders from within the tribe, both
among the men and women; a greater awareness of their own culture, language and
history; and the growth of the confidence that they can do anything. Of course, this is not
absent in Communist-led struggles of tribals for forest land, for the change in
consciousness wrought by Communist-led struggles is a legend by itself. But the feeling
that they are masters of their own destiny which a self-directed movement of the
oppressed brings about is all that and something more. The gap that soon develops, in
movements organised as part of a bigger political strategy, between the movement and
the masses, puts a limit to the self-development of the masses. With the _Naxalites_, whose
accent is on violent militancy, the gap develops even faster, for militancy is always the
attribute of a minority.
