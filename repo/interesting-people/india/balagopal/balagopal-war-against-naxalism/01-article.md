On May 21 this year the Government of
Andhra Pradesh announced a ban on the
_CPI(ML) (People's War group)_ and eight of
what the government described as its front
organisations --- including organisations of
agricultural labourers, tribals, coalmine
workers, women, etc. The chief minister
N Janardhan Reddy himself said that the ban
was an offering made to the departed spirit
of Rajiv Gandhi on the occasion of his first
death anniversary.

This ban takes one significant step further
what the state government has unabashedly
been describing as its 'war' against _Naxalism_.
The 'war' has already resulted in indescribable
misery to the rural poor and
tribals who constitute the principal social
base of the _Naxalites_, i.e., the _CPI(ML)_
groups.

That the banned group believes in the use
of violent means and has indulged in
substantial violence, especially in the last two
years, is no justification whatsoever for this
extralegal attack on its entire social base and
political supporters, especially when the
social base consists of the wretched of the
earth. The violent methods of the _People's
War_ group is neither defended nor condoned.
But recourse to violence does not by
any means justify the denial of political
freedom to a whole political movement.

What is being banned in the name of
political violence is the politics and not just
the violence. Politics, even violent politics,
cannot be treated as criminality. A sensitive
understanding of its social context and
significance must be demanded as an essential
ingredient of a democratic polity's attitude
towards even a violent political movement.
The ban and the powers which the
government seems to think the ban gives it
indicate just the opposite of this politically
sensitive attitude.

It should be added that the men who rule
this state have hardly the credentials to brand
others criminals. Their mafia-style activities
and their colossal corruption are common
knowledge, and if violence and unlawful activities
are sound enough reasons for banning
a political organisation, then it is the
_Congress(I)_ that will first have to be banned.

From the day of the ban the chief minister,
the home minister and police officers have
been threatening the press in very offensive
language. Arrogating to themselves powers
that the act enabling the ban does not even
contemplate, they have been talking of issuing
a code of conduct to the press laying
down what it can publish and what it cannot
publish regarding the affairs of the banned
organisations. Police atrocities on the rural
poor (in the name of suppressing _Naxalism_)
have received considerable publicity in the
press and the suppressed anger of the
government has now found expression in
dreams of censorship not sanctioned by the
legislation. For instance, when an 'encounter'
takes place the press should publish
only the police version and not the _People's
War_ group's version!

As a consequence of these threats journalists
are already feeling insecure and uncertain
about what they can write. Civil liberties
organisations are also being threatened
that they will also be banned unless they
'behave themselves properly', to use the
words of M V Mysoora Reddy, the home
minister of the state. Though that gentleman
cannot possibly entertain illusions that
anyone would gain from taking lessons in
civil liberties --- or even proper behaviour --- from
him, the intent to intimidate is very
evident.

In the villages the police have intensified
raids, threats, arrests and torture, not only
of persons allegedly having connections with
the banned group, but also the cadre and
sympathisers of other _CPI(ML)_ groups
which have not been banned. The people are
living in a state of unprecedented terror.

The ban was promulgated under _section
15(2)(b)_ of the _Criminal Law Amendment
Act, 1908_, which is applicable to the
so-called Andhra area of the state, and the
_Public Security Act, Fasli 1348_, which is applicable
to the Telangana area. The _Criminal
Law Amendment Act; 1908_, empowers the
government to ban organisations which encourage
violence, etc. This was applicable to
British India. In 1950 the (then) Madras state
government amended the operative part of
the act, i.e. _section 15(2)(b)_. It is in this form
that the act applies to that part of Andhra
Pradesh which was then in the Madras State
(the so-called Andhra area). The _Public
Security Act, Fasli 1348_, was enacted by the
Government of Hyderabad in 1938, and it is
this that applies to the Telangana region.

However, _section 15(2)(b)_ of the _Criminal
Law Amendment Act 1908_ was struck down
as unconstitutional by a Constitution bench
of the Supreme Court as far back as 1952.
on the ground that a restriction on a right
guaranteed by _Article 19(1)_ without the provision
of judicial review is not a reasonable
restriction. For the same reason the _Public
Security Act_ is also unconstitutional.

This fact was brought to the notice of the
public and the government through press
releases published by the papers on May 24
and May 26. Other knowledgeable persons
whom the press interviewed endorsed this
opinion and that too has been published by
the papers. And yet the state government
continues to assert that the ban is in force
and that it will be enforced ruthlessly.
