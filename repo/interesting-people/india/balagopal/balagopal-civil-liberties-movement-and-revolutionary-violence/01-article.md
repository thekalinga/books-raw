Before I begin addressing the topic assigned to me, I would like
to raise two issues.

\ 

One pertains to the expression '_revolutionary violence_'. What is
_revolutionary violence_? What is probably meant is the violence
resorted to by the CPI-ML[^cpiml] parties. It is the CPI-ML parties and
the nationality movements that are using a lot of violence in
India. We had a discussion in the preceding session about nationality
movements. So, what is meant by _revolutionary violence_ here
must be the violence of the CPI-ML. But the CPI-ML parties
not alone in describing themselves as 'revolutionary'. The _Dalit
movement_ regards itself as _revolutionary_ and so may the _Women's
movement_. Yet they were referred to as _Dalit movement_ and _Women's
movement_ in yesterday's sessions and not as _revolutionary movement
of the Dalits_ and _revolutionary movement of Women_. Why
cannot the present topic also be similarly described as _violence
of the CPI-ML_ rather than as _revolutionary violence_?

[^cpiml]: Communist Patty of India, Marxist-Leninist.

There is evidently an implied assumption that the politics of the
CPI-ML is synonymous with the notion of _revolution_, whereas
other politics whether of _Dalits_ or Women is only sectional
politics. That may or may not be true. But the question is how
does the _civil rights movement_ presume that it is true and that
too, so obviously true that it needs no explanation? How does the
_civil rights movement_ arrive at this conclusion from its own
premises, within the framework of its understanding?

This is not an isolated or incidental slip. This sort of sleight
of hand by which _Marxist_ or _Marxist-Leninist_ assumptions are
smuggled into the worldview of _civil rights movement_ as if they
are common sense notions of the democratic worldview is quite
common. The point is not whether those assumptions are true or
false. The point is that if they are felt to be basic to the
civil rights worldview, that should be made explicit instead of
keeping them hidden under the pretence that the civil rights
worldview is not restricted to any one political philosophy but
is a broad democratic view.

To my knowledge, no civil rights organisation in India has said
that its worldview is guided by _Marxist_ or _Marxist-Leninist_
theory. They have all drafted seemingly broad-based _manifestos_,
or if they do not have written _manifestos_, they all claim that
they are of a broadly democratic persuasion. This has perhaps
been felt to be necessary in order not to seem sectarian and to
avoid being branded by the State as _pocket organisations of the
Communists_.

This should have been followed by a genuinely broad understanding
and interpretation of issues and events. Instead, the actual
interpretation has usually been based on _Marxist_ or
_Marxist-Leninist_ views of society and social relations. But since
this has not been made explicit, the _civil rights movement_ has
not faced the theoretical problems stemming from this attitude.
If at least, the movement had made its assumptions explicit it
would have been forced to handle the tension between _Communist
theory_ and _Democracy_. Since it has not done so, the untested and
unverified assumptions of _Marxism-Leninism_ continue to determine
many of the attitudes of the _civil rights movement_ in India.

To take an example, in yesterday's presentation, Mr. Bhuyan of
_MASS_ said it is a  task of the _civil rights movement_ to take
seriously any tendency of the people to develop illusions about
_parliamentary democracy_. This is strange advice. It is certainly
the task of the _civil rights movement_ to criticise the limitations
of _parliamentary democracy_ and the distortions in its
practice and to strive to make government more truly representative.
But why should it be the duty of the _civil rights movement_
to ensure that people do not develop illusions about _parliamentary
democracy_ as such? That task makes sense only within a _Marxist-Leninist_
perspective which sees _parliamentary democracy_
rival to its project of _class struggle_ and _proletarian rule_. Why
should that be the concern of the _civil rights movement_? If civil
rights activists feel that it is, they should openly declare that
their worldview is _Marxism_ or _Marxism-Leninism_ and face the
theoretical and practical consequences, instead of keeping
it implicit and avoiding the difficult task of reconciling the
_Communist movement's worldview_ with _Democracy_ and _Civil rights_.
This also applies to the usual attitudes adopted by many in the
_civil rights movement_ towards _Rule of Law_, the _legal system_,
_social reform_, _welfare_, _press freedom_, each of which is customarily
seen by the _Marxist-Leninist_ worldview as illusion, ideology,
repression, fraud etc., and not as values and institutions that
mark civilisational progress whose limitations and distortions
must nevertheless be criticised by the _civil liberties movement_
in order to help advance their progressive and democratic content.

The second question pertains to the inordinate importance given
to the _question of violence_ in the present seminar. The seminar
is supposed to be about the relation between democratic movements
and the _civil liberties movement_, but more than half the seminar
is concerned with the _question of violence_. Is it that violence
is such an important issue for democratic movements? Or does the
reason lie elsewhere ? It seems to me that the reason for this
obsessive concern with _violence_ lies in a basic faith in _violent
solutions_ to _social problems_ which must, it is felt, be justified
in the name of democracy and human rights. Somehow or other the
human rights discourse must be shaped in such a way that it can
be adapted to a justification of violent methods of social transformation.
It is this rather than any genuine concern about the
problems that the _civil liberties movement_ faces with the _question
of violence_ that seems to have motivated the decision to
allot such a large amount of time to the _question of violence_ ---
_revolutionary violence_ of course. I think it is a misfortune of
the human rights movement in India that too many of its activists
have more faith in violence that in humane values, norms and
institutions. Maybe they are right and the others are living in
a fool's paradise. But if that is so, the human rights movement
had better close shop. If it is to exist, it can exist only as an
exploration in democratic values and institutionalised norms.
There can be no place for a _civil rights movement_ that tailors
its views and concerns to suit the needs of violent solutions to
social problems.

Let me now go on to the topic allotted to me. I will not speak of
_revolutionary violence_, but of _political violence_, for I do not
think the _civil rights movement_ can, within its terms, identify
one politics to the exclusion of others as revolutionary. But,
since '_political violence_' as such will include also the violence
of the politics of dominant social groups and classes which
holds no problems for the _civil rights movement_, I will speak of
_political violence_ based upon the needs, hopes and aspirations of
_oppressed groups_ --- whether it is class, caste, gender, or religion.

# The _Question Of Violence_

To a large extent, the _question of violence_ is experienced by the
_civil rights movement_ as an irritant rather than as a
central concern of its practice. I am not here talking of _political
violence_ alone but of violence as such. The _civil rights movement_
gives central importance to the _right to life_. This is the most
important of civil rights and the movement has spent much energy
and effort extending its meaning and scope to include not merely
the right to a physical existence but a full, honourable and
dignified existence. But on the other hand, there is a whole
sphere of violence and the taking of life and liberty in society
about which the _civil rights movement_ is silent. It is not easy
to explain away this silence. Over a period, it has learnt to
campaign against violence stemming from dominant positions in the
social structure . For instance, upper caste violence upon _Dalits_
and violence on women by men. Yet, there remains a large area of
violence in society about which the _civil rights movement_ is
silent.

The very fact that one is talking about _right to life_ as a human
value (and not just the right of so-and-so to life) forces one to
feel uncomfortable about this silence. One answer to this
discomfort has been to say 'that there is a law and there is a
legal system to take care of such acts of violence, and therefore
we need not react to all such acts of violence'. (This is to
concede legitimacy to the law and the legal system, which is
however sometimes denied by the _civil rights movement_ in a
different context, about which later).

This is a purely legalistic argument which can be satisfactory
only if the whole approach of the _civil rights movement_ had been
purely legalistic. That is to say, there is a law, and the administration
must adhere to the law. If this had been the general
stand of the _civil rights movement_ then such exclusively legalistic
arguments would be fully valid. But the general approach of
the _civil rights movement_ has been a mixture of legal , social,
political and perhaps ethical arguments. This is at best. Otherwise,
it is even argued that the legal is illusory, and one
should only talk about social and political issues. (It is an
interesting aside that those who dismiss the legal as illusory
also, usually, deride the ethical as equally illusory). How can
such a movement be satisfied with a purely legal argument when it
comes to answering the question why it does not condemn all
violence?

This is a discomfort that affects all those who work in the _civil
rights movement_. When we condemn custodial deaths of crime
suspects, the people generally question us about the crimes
supposedly committed by that person. '_where were you when this
fellow was breaking into our house and stealing our savings?_'
they ask. The answer that there is a law to deal with such crimes,
and the law can take its course is not always satisfactory. It
is not my contention that the answer is not at all valid. Only
that it is not a fully adequate answer in all contexts. As a
general moral principle, it must be stated that when we defend
the rights of a person or persons we are in some sense and to
Some extent answerable for their acts. The full burden cannot be
put on the law and the legal system which are in any case derided
in other contexts. For instance, if the person who has been
killed in custody is a petty thief, we can say '_let the law take
its course, we do not condemn the poor man's crime_'. We can even
say that the law must take a lenient view of his crime in view of
his poverty. But if, say, the victim of custodial killing is a
professional hired killer, civil rights activists have found it
necessary, in answering the people, to add that we do condemn
the murders committed by the killer. The difference is in the
moral conditions of the act --- the justice or injustice of the
act. Civil rights activists have found that it is impossible to
adopt a purely legalistic argument about violence without reference
to the justice or injustice of the act.

It would have been nice, of course, if violence consisted only of
two types : crimes of powerful people upon the weak, and the
crimes of the weak against the powerful. Then the moral dilemma
would be less severe. In platform rhetoric civil rights activists
frequently speak as if it is so. But in truth, it is not, and we
must frequently make difficult judgments. Even in the case of
theft, where it is the poor who steal, it is usually not from the
very rich but from the middle and the lower middle classes that
they steal. The rich are not easy to rob. They have security
guards and dogs to protect them. That is why the rhetoric that
theft is only a redistribution of social wealth is not always
valid, though it is guaranteed to draw applause in public meetings.

The _question of violence_ --- whether political or otherwise --- has no
easy answer from a democratic or civil rights point of view.
What is usually called _violence_ is only _physical violence_. But
there is also _structural violence_. Inequality exploitation,
lack of freedom, are all instances of violence. And _physical
violence_ is often linked to this _structural violence_. This applies
to ordinary day-to-day acts of violence as well as the
violence of political rebels. But this does not, unhappily,
imply that all _physical violence_ is therefore justified in the
name of _structural violence_. If a hungry person beats up and robs
someone, then it appears that the hunger justifies the violence.
But if, as usually happens, the one who is robbed is not an
exploiter, but himself or herself hardworking person, the
justification becomes more problematic. It is only in the rhetoric
of radical civil rights ideologues that this problem does not
exist. In that rhetoric, there are only two classes in society,
_the exploiters_ and _the exploited_, and all the violence of the
_exploited_, whether individual or organised, is aimed only at the
_exploiters_. In reality, society is more complex and so are acts
of violence. It is neither possible to defend all violence nor
necessary to condemn all of it. To defend is to imply that the
particular act of violence is either an unavoidable consequence
of the _structural violence_ or a necessary act to overcome it.
Usually, it is very difficult to establish either, though it is
always possible and necessary to see its link with the _structured
violence_ of the social system.

All that is possible in this situation, is neither the defence of
the violence of the _exploited_ _in toto_ nor its blanket
condemnation, but an attempt to understand it in the given social
context. To understand it is not to imply that the violence is an
inevitable consequence or a necessary act, but only to see its
link with the social system in a realistic way. The operative
meaning of this attempt to understand the social context is
two-fold.

One is to turn the attention of society from an exclusive
concentration on _physical violence_ and force it to look at the
violence built into social system, and the need to remedy that
violence first. The second is to plead for a lenient view on the
part of the law and the legal system towards acts of violence
that have a proximate connection with social oppression. The law
as it exists today, also allows a lenient view of certain crimes,
mostly crimes committed in defence of _life and property_ or on
_grave provocation_. This can be extended to crimes linked to
social oppression or deprivation. This is a delicate task which
first of all requires that the _civil rights movement_ distances
itself from the violence so that it can persuade society to look
at it democratically, that is to the social context and
background to the violence. This requires that we accept that
there is a neutral or at least a third space between the perpetrators
of violence and the state. A neutral or a third ground
which can be addressed in terms of democratic values and principles.
It is this space that the _civil rights movement_ addresses.
Of course, those who hold that there are only two classes in
society, only two viewpoints on any matter, and only two positions
to align with, cannot and will not accept this. But in such
a perspective, the _civil rights movement_ has no place at all. It
can only be abandoned.

When we speak of violence, we must necessarily speak of _law_ and
_rule of law_. There is a point of view in the _civil rights movement_
that the law is itself oppressive and that the people have
right to violate the law. I do not think that this is a
tenable view. _Rule of law_ is in fact more necessary for the poor
and the weak than for the rich and the powerful. When we speak
of the poor, we should not speak of them as if they are
perpetually involved in a _political struggle_. Only then _law_ and
_rule of law_ appear as a hindrance. As a matter of fact, even for
struggles, the law is an aid as much as it can be a hindrance.
People involved in struggles, frequently appeal to the law for
aid. It is only if the struggle is equated with violence that the
law appears more as a hindrance than as a possible aid. But such
an equation is illegitimate.

But as a matter of fact, to see the poor and the oppressed as if
they are perpetually involved in a _political struggle_ is itself
an error. The overwhelming majority of the poor and the oppressed
are mainly involved in day-to-day existence, and this existence
requires a law-bound society. In a lawless society it is they who
would suffer much more than the rich and the powerful. A _civil
rights movement_ that is not concerned with this day-to-day existence
of the poor but only with _struggle_ is not doing its full job. In
the next session, we have speakers speaking on _rule of law_ and
_class struggle_. Apart from the question why we should be
concerned only with _class struggle_ and not with other _political
struggles_ of the oppressed social groups, I would like to point
out that only if we also talk of _rule of law_ and day-to-day
existence of the poor can get a full appreciation of the role
of _law_.

The fact is that the poor and the oppressed require _law_ and
_law-bound society_ as much as --- and perhaps more than --- the rich and
the powerful. But the paradox is that this law, apart from
giving the stability and security of a norm-bound society, also
by its very nature stabilises and reproduces unequal social
relations. And hence, whether in their day-to-day existence or
their struggles to overcome inequality, the oppressed also face
the law as a repressive force. To live, they need law but to
better their lives, they sometimes need to break the law. Ofcourse,
to the extent that the law is sensitive to
the requirement of _change_, it may help the aspiration of _change_
as much as it inhibits _change_ in its more traditional role. This
may be summarised by saying that the poor and the oppressed have
no interest in an absolute right to violate law. Any such
destructive attitude to the law can make life impossible for
them. But they have a right to violate _unjust laws_ or the _unjust
use of otherwise reasonable laws_. There is nothing very radical
about this. Even Mahatma Gandhi said so. What he would regard
as _just_ may not be the same what the _civil rights movement_
regards as _just_, but that principle is as far as the _civil rights
movement_ can or should go.

Law, therefore, is a legitimate thing and there is no need to
delegitimise it. That would harm the people. But it is necessary
to demystify the law. Law carries the mystification that _whatever
is lawful is just_ and _whatever is unlawful is unjust_. This, as we
know, is not necessarily true. To fight for the demystification
of the law without delegitimising it is a delicate and complex
task that the _civil rights movement_ must undertake. This rather
than the rhetoric that the law, as such, is an ideological instrument
of oppression, is the task of the _civil rights movement_.

# The Question of _Political Violence_

In addition to the above considerations which apply to
unorganised as well as organised violence, something extra needs
to be said with reference to the _political violence_ based upon
the hopes, aspirations and grievances of _oppressed groups_.

Ignoring the violence for a moment, what exactly is the relation
between the _civil rights movement_ and _political movements_ based
on the hopes and desires of an _oppressed group_? Firstly, why
should there be a relation at all ? The _civil rights movement_ is
concerned with the progressive democratisation of social
relations, norms, values and institutions. This may be achieved
either by constructive reforms or the pressure exerted by organised
_political movements_ of the oppressed. That is why, there
will be and should be a link between the _civil rights movement_
and existing legal and political institutions as well as between
the _civil rights movement_ and _political movements_ of the oppressed.
The organisers of the _political movements_ describe the
former concern as reformist illusions and the State describes the
latter as extremist connections. Whatever they say, the _civil
rights movement_ will necessarily have both concerns.

But what should be the latter relation i.e. the relation with
_political movements_? _Political movements_ based upon the oppressed
have two aspects. One is the democratic aspiration arising
from the life situation of the oppressed, and the other is
the political programme, strategy and theoretical formulations of
the organisation that leads the movement. The civil rights movement
is primarily concerned with former. It is the democratic
aspirations underlying the movement that the _civil liberties
movement_ picks up and integrates into the prevalent democratic
world view. While _political movements_ usually address their own
social base, the _civil rights movement_ addresses the rest of
society and forces it to think about the democratic aspirations
of the movement. This basic difference which cannot be
comprehended by those who work with a binary model of the society
in which there are only two classes, only two interests, only two
viewpoints etc. Such people --- and there are many in the _civil
rights movement_ --- demand that the _civil rights movement_ merge its
voice with that of the rebel _political movements_, or else join
the enemy. On the contrary, the role of the _civil rights movement_
is predicated upon the assumption that between the movements of
the oppressed and the State (or the oppressors) there is a third,
fourth , fifth etc., space. This is not a territorial space in
society but a space of values in _social consciousness_. The _civil
rights movement_ addresses this space and works to gain acceptance
in it for the democratic aspirations and values brought
forward by the movements of the oppressed. And where possible, it
will attempt to institutionalise the values and aspirations. It
can do this only if it speaks with its own voice and not the
voice of the _political movement_ in question. And only if it
speaks in terms of values and ideas and not in terms of the
political ideologies and strategies of the movement. Given its
role and its aims, it is under no obligation to tailor its understanding
to suit the ideological and strategical needs of the
movement. That is a matter of no concern for it.

If this is true of the relation between the _civil liberties
movement_ and the _political movements_ of the oppressed in general,
it is much more true of the relation with _political violence_. As
has been said earlier, the _civil rights movement_ which speaks
in the name of _right to life_, must necessarily have a cautious
attitude towards violence. It can at best be an attitude of
calling attention to the social context and background of the
violence and arguing for an approach that addresses the context
instead of being obsessed with the violence.

More caution is called for in the matter of _political violence_.
For _political violence_ is aimed at the _establishment or capture
of power_. And the _civil rights movement_ must forever be suspicious
of _power_. It is _power_ --- of the State over citizens, of the
upper castes over _Dalits_, of men over women, of the capitalists
over workers, of the developed over the backward, of the majority
over the minority etc. --- that is the central programmatic concern
of the _civil liberties movement_. It cannot therefore rub
shoulders with violent movements that aspire for power. It recognises
their popular base, and accepts and propagates the democratic
and egalitarian aspirations underlying the movement. But
it cannot merge its voice with that of the movement.

Organised movements that aspire for power have the characteristic
habit of trying to subsume everything under their domination.
They demand the consent of all for all they do. They demand
acceptance of their claim that their organisation is identical
with the people it represents. Its actions are theirs and its
decisions are theirs. The movement, in its desire to establish
its power over society, wants that the people should lose all
faith in the existing social setup, that is to say lose all
'illusions' about existing society. Such movements therefore put
pressure on all to work towards alienating the people from the
present system.

The _civil liberties movement_ is also subjected to this pressure.
But if it succumbs to the pressure, that will be an abdication of
its particular role which is to both work for reform within the
system and to argue for keeping space open for superseding the
basic terms of the system.

The pressure on the _civil rights movement_ is most severe in the
case of the violence used by organised _political movements_. They
demand that the _civil rights movement_ should describe all the
violence they indulge in as _people's violence_. Since the people
are suffering, and since they have chosen to hit back violently,
the violence, whatever form it takes, is justified and
democratic, is the argument of the organised movements. And the
_civil rights movement_ is supposed to help propagate this
argument. It must refuse to fall into this trap. It need not and
will not deny whatever popular support the organisation has. But
it cannot equate the decisions and actions of the organisation
with those of the people. They belong to the organisation and are
usually part of the coldblooded decisions of strategy and tactics
adopted by the organisation. The organisations have many and
varied reasons for indulging in acts of violence, not all of
which can be attributed to the _just anger_ of the _oppressed
people_, though it is in the name of this _just anger_ that the
organisations demand support for all their acts of violence.

From the experience that the _civil rights movement_ has in
observing the violence of organised armed struggles, it is
possible to identify the following reasons for the violence they
indulge in.

a. Acts of violence aimed at oppressive and cruel individuals
whom the people really hate and wish to injure.
b. Acts of violence aimed at persons who are felt to be
obstructing the course of the organisation leading the movement,
whether or not they are hated by the people in general.
c. Acts of violence intended to strike terror in the enemy camp
of the organisation, aimed at any person in the enemy camp, who
may not otherwise be an obstruction to the organisation or an
enemy of the people, but whose killing is useful to create terror.
d. Acts of violence intended to strike terror in the police, in
which any policeman --- whether he is known to be cruel or not --- is
killed or acts intended to strike terror in the ruling party, in
which any member of the ruling party whether or not he is known
to be bad person is killed.
e. Acts of violence aimed at persons who work against the
political interests and the _diktats_ of the organisation, even if
such persons do no harm to the people, and only exercise their
own right of political freedom.
f. Acts of violence aimed at enforcing the _writ_ of the
organisation in arbitration of disputes, settlement of issues, or
award of punishment. Such acts of violence frequently do not
follow any reasonable norms.
g. Acts of violence such as burning or blowing up government
property --- buses, telephone exchanges, courts, banks, revenue
offices. Such acts frequently cause a lot of inconvenience and
even harm to the people.

This is a broad categorization of the acts indulged in by organisations
leading violent struggles all the way from Telangana to
Kashmir to Assam. As said above, all this violence is sought to
be labeled "_people's violence_" and justified in terms of the _just
anger_ of the people against _oppression and deprivation_. But it is
in fact the violence of an organised political group, notwithstanding
that it may have a substantial degree of general support
among the people.

How does the _civil rights movement_ react to this violence? I have
already explained the general attitude that the _civil rights
movement_ should adopt towards violence: not to defend it but to
link it with the social system and the _structural violence_ inherent
in it, and to plead for an understanding of the cause of the
violence and a democratic approach towards it. This applies more
directly to the _political violence_ linked to _social oppression
and deprivation_. There is no question of equating the people with
the organisation that acts on their behalf, no question of justifying
its violence in the name of _the people_, but it is necessary
to point to the suffering and the hopes of the people, their
aspiration for justice and equity, as the _social context_ of the
violence. The _context_, but only the _context_ and nothing more. The
_civil rights movement_, on the basis of this attitude asks for a
democratic and civilised approach on the part of the State and
the society towards the organisations that lead the violent
struggles, the violence they perpetrate, and the people who
constitute the social base of the movement.

This does not exhaust the whole of the _civil rights movement_'s
approach to the question of _political violence_. There are some
instances where the acts of the violent _political movements_ must
be condemned. Since there is a lot of deliberately created
confusion in this matter, it must be clarified that what needs to
be condemned is not violence as such but _unjust violence_. It is
the injustice that demands condemnation. Since the violence of
the organisation is explained by the _civil rights movement_
response to social injustice. and a reflection of the peoples
aspirations for justice, it cannot keep quiet when the
organisation itself behaves unjustly. Less so, when the injustice
takes violent forms. Since the proponents of violent politics do
not like such criticism they try to create the impression that
the _civil rights movement_ proposes to condemn the people resorting
to violence to solve the problems that they have not been
able to solve by legal means. This is a deliberate distortion. AS
has been explained more than once, the _civil rights movement_
insists on understanding the context of such violence. While it
will not justify any violence, it will ask for a democratic
attitude towards such ineluctable acts of violence, which includes
a lenient view on the part of the law. What the _civil
rights movement_ must however condemn is injustice done in the
name of the fight for justice. Since the basic idiom of the
_civil rights movement_ is that of _justice_ and _injustice_, and since
it asks society to look at and respond to the aspirations for
justice that lie behind organised _political violence_, it cannot
keep quiet when that violence takes unjust forms.

Since the perpetrators of _political violence_ do not like such
criticism they accuse the civil rights activists of either
being scared or having sold out to the State. This criticism must
be dismissed with the contempt it deserves. It is theoretically
justified --- or sought to be justified --- with the argument that
there are only two sides in society, that of the _oppressor_ and
that of the _oppressed_, and there cannot be any middle ground
between the two. Those who are not with the oppressed are by
definition with the oppressors. In this specious argument, there
is again a deliberate equation of the _oppressed people_ with the
organised _political movement_ which functions on their behalf.
Criticism of that movement is equated with condemning the _oppressed
people_, and therefore joining hands with the oppressors.
This line of argument will not do. The _civil rights movement_ is
of course with the oppressed, not in the sense that it supports
all that they or the parties based upon them do. But in the sense
that it defends their aspirations for justice. And from the same
point of view of justice, it wil
criticise the acts of the organisations that lead the movement
arising from the aspirations of the oppressed.

The _civil rights movement_, like everyone else, must learn from
history. One of the lessons to be drawn from the failure of the
socialist experiment of this century, is that political parties
and organisations that begin as representatives of workers and
peasants and stand for the values of democracy and socialism can
turn against them in the course of time. It is better that from
the very beginning we learn to distinguish the people and the
party or organisation and not allow the latter to claim identity
with the people and to appropriate the aspirations of the people
as justification of all of its politics, its strategies and its
violence. It is as necessary to make this distinction as to
acknowledge the actual extent of the popularity of the party or
the organisation.

The _civil rights movement_ cannot run behind any _political
movement_. There is no single _political movement_ that can
guarantee the solution to all problems and gratification of all
aspirations. Reality is multidimensional, and so is the effort
to transform reality. In this multi pronged effort, the _civil
rights movement_ has a role of its own. The role is to protect
and advance historically achieved democratic values and
institutions, to keep the possibilities of further advance
through _political struggles_ open, to disseminate in the society
the democratic content of _political movements_, to strive for
just and democratic attitude towards such movements, including
their acts of violence, and to act as a check on the resort to
arbitrary and unjust forms of behaviour by the parties and
organisations that lead the struggles for justice. It can never
be the handmaid of any _political movement_.
