_If one is not constrained by the usual subaltern scholars' hostility
towards any objective assessment of popular consciousness, one
will see that the question of 'moral outrage' is quite complex.
What is really involved is the legitimacy of rebellion, which is
neither an immutable absolute nor is determined autonomously in
popular consciousness by the way the oppressed masses relate to
the situation of oppression._

\ 

There is half an hour yet for the district
courts complex of Adilabad to open. The
wide and clean road --- roads are usually
wide and clean in drought-hit areas, for
land has no premium and there is no water
to make mud-running past the courts
and out of the town is just now coming
to life. A stray lawyer or two, starched and
black-coated, walks into the court compound,
bearing an unaccustomed air of
dignity with some difficulty. Opposite the
compound the tea stalls have already
come alive with the clatter of china and
court gossip. The purveyor of the gossip
--- whether _muzrim_, _munshi_ or middle man --- wears
the air of casual cynicism that affects
all places that are visited by people
in distress: courts, hospitals and jails, to
wit. A certain moral stink envelops the
court; it is just now gathering, and will
reach a depressing intensity by about
midday.

But in the meanwhile, there is a clean
young man --- by his looks a tribal
--- coming along the road walking beside a
bullock cart laden with wood. One calls
it a cart for want of a better word, just
as one calls them bullocks for want of a
better word. The cart has the tiniest of
wheels and the barest of frames, and the
bullocks look like mere calves. Since no
more elaborate contraption than this cart
would make it over the undulating land
to the godforsaken _Gond_ hamlet to which
it is no doubt destined, the cart could be
called 'appropriate technology' (though,
on second thoughts, one is bound to ask
_what_ it is appropriate for, as there is no
earthly reason why the terrain should
forever remain so uneven and impassable),
but there is nothing appropriate about the
bullocks: they are merely underfed.

Just as the tribal and his cart come into
the shadow of justice, there is a shout
from the left and a middle-aged man
rushes at him from a bylane. He is slight
and awkwardly built but the tribal cringes
before him and stops in his tracks. The
man goes up to him, and they have an
argument. As the curious bystanders near
the tea-stalls look on, the argument ends
quickly, with the man hitting the tribal
across the face and detaching the bullocks.

The cart kneels forward and the wood it
is carrying tumbles onto the road. The
tribal looks miserable, and the man who
has hit him ties the animals to a pole and
walks triumphantly to the tea-stall. Unbidden,
he explains his behaviour to the
people gathered there He speaks the gutter
Urdu that is the language of street
brawls in the erstwhile dominions of the
Nizam of Hyderabad. It transpires that he
is a petty trader, a _marwari_ no doubt but
a poor one for all that, and he has newly
entered this business of buying up plough-cattle
from the tribals and renting them
out again on an annual basis. How foolish
of the tribals to allow such a business,
comments a lawyer's _munshi_, whose _paan_-stained
lips give him a look of wisdom;
no doubt it would be a foolish thing to
allow in normal circumstances, assents the
trader, but last year was not a normal one.
There was a near-total failure of both the
_kharif_ and the _rabi_ crops, for as you all
know it rained too much in the first
season and not at all in the second, and
soon the peasants --- especially the tribals,
many of whom do not have title-deeds for
the land they cultivate and therefore cannot
raise loans from banks --- were close to
starvation. They started selling their
plough-bullocks at the weekly fair. The
Jainur fair soon started looking like an exclusive
cattle fair. A man needs a moral
reason for doing selfish things, as we all
know, and so the tribals would say they
are selling the cattle because there is no
fodder to feed them with, but in reality
the selfish fellows are selling the dumb
animals so that they can feed themselves.
At this point a dhoti-clad listener, a
litigant by his looks, interferes to say that
all this nonsense about starvation _is so_
much hot air because the government is
supplying rice to the poor at Rs 2 per kg,
or has this _marwari_ not heard of the
scheme that has made NTR famous all
over the land? The others look suspiciously
at the litigant's yellow shirt, and one
of them answers that to buy NTR's rice
you must have the right amount of money
at the right time, neither of which is easy
for the poor. When the dealer has stocks
you don't have the money, and when you
manage to gather enough money the
dealer says there are no stocks. That is
really why the tribals are selling their
cattle; to make NTR's scheme operational.

That is all very well, but what does the
_marwari_ do with the cattle? Does he buy
up the tribals' land too for the cattle to
plough? No, this _marwari_ has not yet acquired
land (others have), nor does he sell
the bullocks to anybody else. He has
discovered a more lucrative business,
which has become quite popular this year.
The tribals who have sold the bullocks to
feed themselves want them back now that
it is monsoon time; and since their need
is desperate the traders are now dictating
the terms. Instead of selling the bullocks
back they are renting them out on an annual
basis. The rate? Well, to tell a lie
would give displeasure to the gods, so the
trader confesses that he charges an annual
rent of Rs 400 or more for a pair of
bullocks that he has bought for Rs 500.
He takes the rent in advance, for these
fellows who look so innocent are capable
of bluffing you out of your own home,
and if you don't collect in advance, you
don't collect, ever. A nice business, murmurs
an envious listener; yes says the
_marwari_, the gods have been kind to him.
After a while somebody asks what was the
meaning of the recent scene, pointing in
explanation to the tribal crouching by the
roadside opposite the tea-stalls. Here the
trader's tone becomes almost piteous with
injured righteousness. That ingrate you
see there is a _Gond_ son-of-a-dog from
Tiriani, he says. Three months ago he sold
his cattle at the Jainur fair and fattened
himself and his bitch of a wife on rice,
ghee and curds. Now the monsoons are
close at hand, there is a film of cloud in
the sky and a strong breeze blowing across
the land, and he again wants bullocks to
plough his fields. He comes begging, with
tears in his eyes, for a pair of bullock --- nice
strong animals they are, as you can
see --- and promises to pay the rent in a
week's time. Now, continues the trader,
one has always been kind-hearted to a
fault, it is a congenital trait, and anyway,
my brethren, this world is such an unkind
place, if one man does not help another
in need, where would we all be? And so
he gave the tribal son-of-a-dog the pair
of bullocks on the agreement that he
would pay Rs 400 in a week's time. A week
passes by, two weeks pass by, and the third
is drawing to a close, but there is no sign
of the dog. Just as the honest trader is
contemplating a police complaint he spies
him quite by accident now. He has
harnessed the animals to a cart --- the perfidious
liar, he said he wanted them to
plough land --- and with your own eyes you
saw that he was smuggling wood and
sneaking out of the town. A fair-minded
listener interjects at this point that you do
not smuggle wood _out of_ the town, it
should be the other way round, but the
trader's sense of injury is too intense for
mere reason. Ignoring the interference the
trader continues his narration. He stopped
the wretch and demanded an explanation;
and do you know what he replies,
that arrogant so-and-so? He says his land
does not grow a crop in one week; it takes
time for the seed to be sown, to sprout,
become a plant, and bear a crop --- as if
one did not know all that. And he even
adds --- here the good trader is livid with
anger --- that his land is not like a _marwari_
who lends to one man now and one man
then so that there is always some crop
coming home. That, of course, was when
he hit the fellow across the face, detached
the bullocks, and tied them to the pole.

But by this time the listeners have lost
interest in this conflict.

The district of Adilabad has been constantly
in the news in Andhra Pradesh
these days. There has been news about
tribal youth picked up from their villages
and shot dead by the police (and described
as 'unidentified _naxalites_' killed in encounters);
news about _naxalites_ laying
land mines and blowing up police jeeps;
news about _Telugu Desam Party_ leaders
going on hunger strike demanding an end
to fake 'encounter' killings; and news
about raids by starved tribals upon the
houses and shops of traders and moneylenders
living in towns and big villages,
raids of the kind that historians have
found fascinating material for spinning
theories about popular struggles and
popular consciousness. The first raid took
place at the village _of_ Pembi in Khanapur
_taluk_ on October 3, 1988; and after that
there have been raids at Penchikalapeta,
Thosham, Jainath, Talamaddi, Rajura
and Dandcpalli, as well as a few other
places across the border, in Maharashtra.
In each incident, about 200 to 300 tribals,
accompanied by armed _naxalites_, have
raided the houses of moneylenders and
taken away money as well as some of the
pawned articles; they have raided the
shops of grain dealers and taken away rice
and jawar to be eaten and sown; and they
have also generally broken into the houses
and shops of traders of all varieties and
taken away money, clothes, jewellery,
anything they could lay their hands on.

The background to these raids is the
unusually severe failure of crops last year.
In a year when the rains were _reportedly_
good (in terms of total precipitation), and
in a district which is ringed on three sides
by the Godavari and its tributaries --- the
Pranahita, Penganga, Swarna and Kadem
rivers --- there is nothing 'natural' about
such a failure, but the failure was very real
nevertheless, 45 out of the 52 _mandals_ in
the district were declared drought-affected
by the government; the district collector
reported partial failure of the _kharif_ crop
(cotton, paddy, _jowar_ and pulses) and
total failure of the _rabi_ crop (mainly _jowar_,
pulses and sesamum). The district collector's
estimate of crop loss is Rs 36.92
crore, but since crop loss is defined as the
short fall in the yield of the crop that is
sown, this does not reflect what the
peasants themselves would regard as the
actual loss. The actual loss should take
into account what is not sown at all,
which can be considerable in conditions
of continuing crop failure. _Rabi_ sowing,
for instance, was about 40 per cent below
normal in the district last year, though
_kharif_ sowing was almost normal. For the
peasant, this represents a very real loss of
income, though official statistics never include
it.

The crop failure was due to a peculiar
combination of torrential rains in the
south-west monsoon and practically no
rains in the north-east monsoon. The
unceasing rains _of_ the first monsoon
flooded the lands, washed away soil and
breached tanks. This is one of the problems
concerning which nothing has ever
been done anywhere in the country, let
alone a neglected district like Adilabad.
With proper management of land and
water sources, heavy rains --- at least up to
a point --- can be a boon, but today they
are a disaster. Cultivators in the plains
region of eastern and southern Adilabad
saw the village tanks breach one by one.
The location and construction of irrigation
tanks[^3] is such that five or six of them
form a complex, with the overflow from
those located upland flowing into those
located below. This structural convenience
leads to a cascade-effect when the upper
tank breaches: the suddenly released water
washes off the surrounding soil and
rushes into the tanks below, and not only
do the tanks below also breach, but the
land all round is spoilt. The uplands are
denuded of soil and the lowlands become
a dumping ground for loose soil. By the
time the rains stop the tanks are empty
and the land is barren.

[^3]: An irrigation tank or tank is an artificial reservoir of any size. They are mainly found in India. It can also have a natural or man-made spring included as part of a structure. Tanks are part of an ancient tradition of harvesting and preserving the local rainfall and water from streams and rivers for later use, primarily for agriculture and drinking water, but also for sacred bathing and ritual. Often a tank was constructed across a slope so to collect and store water by taking advantage of local mounds and depressions.

But the worst affected were the undulating
highlands of the northern part
of Adilabad, especially the north-central
region consisting of the revenue _mandals_
of Jainur, Sirpur, Narnur and Tiriani,
which together cover a compact plateau
located towards the north of the roadside
village of Indravelli where the police fired
upon a large gathering of tribals in April 1981.
There are neither irrigation tanks
nor wells here; the terrain is uneven and
forested, and the population is largely
tribal. Unevenness of the terrain is no
reason why the region has remained un-irrigated,
for such a terrain offers good
scope for minor irrigation projects, and
the tribals themselves will point out to a
number of locations where water from
forest streams can be trapped to irrigate
a couple of hundred acres or more, but
the government has never shown serious
interest in exploiting such possibilities. Irrigation
in the whole of Adilabad remains
at the low figure of 9.2 per cent of cultivable
land (the state's average is about 34
per cent), and most of it is in the south
and west, which are watered by tanks,
wells, and irrigation projects on the
Kadem, Swarna and Godavari rivers.

And so when the skies started belching
water, the peasants of the north-central
_mandals_ just watched helplessly as the
uneven terrain got water-logged; the rich
'black cotton' soil of the district makes it
impossible to work in such conditions,
even to the extent of removing the weeds
that grow fast in the rains. The new shoots
of _jowar_, cotton and _asmaan tari_ (rain-fed
paddy) drowned easily in the floods. It
rained for weeks without end, but in the
beginning the peasants were not altogether
disheartened; let the rains stop, and we will
sow again and get a good crop with the
moisture retained by the soil, they thought.
The rains did stop, but once they stopped
 so completely that the soil --- apart
from that which was anyway
denuded --- lost moisture fast, and the
freshly sown crop withered in the sun.
There was not a drop of rain in November
and December --- the active months for the
north-east monsoon --- and the crop failure
was total.

Very soon the people of the area were
driven to the verge of starvation. Very little
non-agricultural work is available after the
close of the summer season. In summer
the people pick _tendu_[^1] leaves in the forest,
an activity available for two months a
year; it pays reasonably well now, thanks
to the sustained struggles conducted with
the encouragement of the CPI-ML
groups. The piece-rate for the picking of
_tendu_ leaf has increased more than six-fold
in the last decade and a half all over
the Godavari valley region. But with the
coming of the rains there is no more picking
of _tendu_ leaf. The other source of
non-agricultural work --- laying of roads
--- is another activity that comes to an end
with the coming of the rains. Normally
it would not have mattered that these
avenues of work are closed but with the
sudden and near-total crop failure the lack
of other work became a serious matter.
There was a considerable amount of migration
to far off areas --- the coal mines of
the _Singareni Collieries Company_ in
eastern Adilabad, the canal-irrigated
southern _talukas_ where assured irrigation
made the _rabi_ crop possible, the coal
mines and the thermal power plant in
Karimnagar, etc. The non-tribal poor and
the more mobile among the tribals like the
_lambadas_ migrated in proportionately
large numbers, whereas the more backward
and less mobile among the tribals, the
_Gonds_ and _Kolams_, migrated in smaller
numbers. For those who stayed behind
there were only two sources of succour:
the forests and the moneylenders. From
the forests they knew how to obtain food
of various types and other produce which
they could exchange against food, From
the moneylenders, who gave them crop-loans
every season at the rate of 50 _paise_
per rupee per cropping season --- amounting
to an annual interest of 100 per
cent --- they hoped to get some consumption
loan to tide over the difficult days.

[^1]: The _tendu_ tree is found widely across central India. Leaves plucked from its shrubs are used to wrap _bidi_ --- the poor man's cigarette.

The forests did not disappoint them but
the moneylenders did. Giving a crop-loan
is one thing in a region where cotton is
an important crop that occupies 21 per
cent of the cultivated area (nearly double
the area under paddy and almost half that
under _jowar_ --- the staple cereal); the methods
of cultivation remain what they were when
the crop was first introduced to the area,
and so the yield they get is hardly one-fourth
of what the cotton cultivators of
the coastal districts like Guntur get, but
nevertheless for a moneylender a cash
crop is a cash crop. And so every season
the tribals borrow working capital from
them at an annual interest of 100 per cent
and repay it at the end of the season. The
loan is usually given in the form of foodgrains
and seed, at a time when their price
is high, but the repayment must be made
in cash, for the price of grain declines
after harvest time. The moneylenders are
mostly _marwaris_, Telugu _Komatis_ and a
few muslims, all of them grain merchants,
cotton dealers or landlords. They live in
the _mandal_ headquarters towns or in big
villages. Often it happens that a tribal
defaults too often and becomes irredeemably
indebted; he does not then become
a bonded labourer, for as long as there is
some forest left to be cleared and cultivated
--- whatever the consequences --- a
tribal will never bond himself the way a
_harijan_ in a village would. So what normally
happens is that once the accumulated
debt exceeds the value of the articles
pawned, the tribal gives up his land to the
moneylender, though of course there may
not be any recorded transfer, first because
the tribals themselves frequently do not
have title deeds for the land they cultivate,
and second because the law does not allow
transfer of land from a tribal to a non-tribal
in a _scheduled area_. Many of the
moneylenders have become quite big landlords
owning 70 to 80 acres of land, in the
process.

In other words, Adilabad is more like
a historical record left over from the nineteenth
century than anything that belongs
to the late twentieth century. At least so
far as the tribal-moneylender relation
goes.

When the crops failed so badly last year
the tribals thought they would raise a
loan from the moneylenders to see them
through until the next monsoon. But the
moneylenders were not willing. Lending
working capital for a cash crop is one
thing, but giving a consumption loan in
a drought year to a people whose rate of
saving even in a normal year is not such
as to enthuse any pawn-broker is a different
thing altogether. And so they refused
bluntly. This angered the tribals a lot,
for they had never defaulted in the past,
and moreover the moneylenders were still
in possession of many of their valuables,
pawned against previous loans. They
regarded the refusal as a betrayal of trust,
a _breach of obligation_. They were, in the
words of the subaltern historian David
Hardiman writing on the '_Bhils_ and
_Shahukars_ of Eastern Gujarat (_Subaltern
Studies_, Volume V), 'morally outraged'.

But if one is not constrained by the
usual subaltern scholars' hostility towards
any objective assessment of popular consciousness,
one will see that the question
of 'moral outrage' is quite a complex one,
granting for a moment (but only for a
moment) that mere starvation has never
led to a rebellion and that people have
rebelled only when they are morally outraged
by the violation of what they understand
as _social obligations_, what is really
involved here is the _legitimacy of rebellion_,
which is neither an immutable absolute,
nor is it determined autonomously in
popular consciousness by the way the oppressed
masses relate to the situation of
oppression.

Every unequal relation, every relation
of domination, is a relation of tension.
The very fact that it comes into being and
reproduces itself implies the generation
and internalisation on both sides of a certain
_common morality_ that legitimises the
domination, while at the same time conceding
something to the oppressed in the
form of a line _of_ demarcation beyond
which the domination is regarded as 'excessive'
and is condemned. This is not an
equilibrium 'moral code' consisting of
'certain expectations' generated by the
'balance of power' or 'the _status quo_ of
the moment'; even if we concede Hardiman's
contention that the _Bhils_ and
_Shahukars_ of eastern Gujarat constituted
'two systems of social organisation and
morality interacting and coming into occasional
conflict with each other', rather
than two social classes _within_ a single
social organisation, the concluding tag
that neither exercised 'moral hegemony'
over the other is more a presumption than
an inference. On the contrary, a relation
of domination cannot reproduce itself except
under the umbrella of a hegemonic
ideology, including a hegemonic morality.

It is true that this legitimising morality
is not a one-point ideology that forms the
sum and substance of the consciousness
of the masses, and to the extent that hasty
Marxist exposition has tended to treat it
as such, the subaltern scholars' criticism
is justified (though even so one cannot
avoid the feeling that their polemics are
as laboured as their research is meticulous).
But the internalisation, the legitimacy,
is very real, and it is the moral
standard which measures and certifies the
legitimacy of the social behaviour of
either party. This standard, which is the
common social conscience of the oppressor
and the oppressed, is _itself an aspect of
domination_. When the people are outraged
at the breach of what they regard as a
_norm_ or _obligation_, they are not reacting
from the standpoint of a moral code
defined by their way of relating to the unequal
relation, but from the standpoint
of this social conscience. There is no
'autonomous and undominated region' of
popular consciousness, as Partha Chatterjee
(who distinguishes himself among the
subaltern theoreticians by a laudable
desire to make himself intelligible to
ordinary mortals) would have us believe.
Popular consciousness and the consciousness
of the masses are not two separate
entities, two separate ways of looking at
the relation; they from an unbroken continuum,
the _totality_ of which is enveloped
and penetrated by the hegemonic morality.
The values and ideas generated by the
material life of the masses are at every
point coloured by the values and ideas
--- the 'ideology' --- of what these scholars call
the 'elite', 'folk' to the tribals suffering from
drought, and they will give you their
analysis and evaluation, their fads and
their myths, their reason and unreason,
and go on without any break to
brahminical notions of the inferiority of
jungle-folk, and the ideology of bureaucratic
patronage summed up by the term
_scheduled tribe_. To break this continuum
and separate the ideas of the masses from
the ideology of the ruling classes requires
struggle and political intervention --- not
necessarily from outside but not always
from within either --- but such a development
through struggle is precisely what is
denied in the notion of an autonomous
and undominated region supposedly
always present in the consciousness of the
masses.

The legitimising morality, for the reason
that it is legitimising the domination of
the oppressors and therefore has to accommodate
the resentment of the oppressed,
has perforce to define a perimeter
beyond which the behaviour of the oppressors
becomes 'outrageous' and the
rebellion of the oppressed becomes _socially
legitimate_. The neglected wife is expected
to suffer the neglect silently, but
it will be understood if she rebels when
he starts bringing the other woman home.
This perimeter, this dividing line between
what is legitimate and what is not in the
behaviour of either class, is a product of
the state of the struggle between the oppressor
and the oppressed. In taking this
struggle forward the role of political
leadership --- whether that is provided by
advanced elements of the oppressed
classes who are able to perceive that what
is 'moral' merely legitimises domination,
or by dissident elements of the dominant
classes who are alienated from their class
by their sensitivity or their private neurosis;
or by the cultural influence of a different
society --- is crucial that leadership can
popularise, spread, and thereby _legitimise_
the notion of struggle against oppression
itself, and not just against the breach of
norms that are sanctioned by the oppressors.
The annulment of the perimeter
of moral legitimacy, and the definition of
a new dividing line that has a lower level
of tolerance of injustice, usually takes
place hand in hand with the coming
together in political solidarity of diverse
individuals _of_ the oppressed groups. To
describe this annulment as an advance in
consciousness will be decried by the
subaltern scholars as an elitism that 'seeks
to be a judge of what is best for the lower
classes' (David Hardiman, _op. cit._), but it
_is_ an advance in the precise sense that it
is able to see evil in domination itself, and
not in some outrageous consequence of
domination. The fact that the lack of a
'strictly scientific-rationalist outlook' did
not prevent the _Bhils_ --- and has not prevented
any oppressed group anywhere
--- from rebelling need not lead us to the
meaningless conclusion that a 'scientific-rationalist'
understanding could (not)
have served (the people) 'better'. And once
the advance in consciousness takes place,
mere inequality or oppression can make
them rebel. Perhaps, on second thoughts,
more food-riots have taken place because
of mere hunger than David Hardiman
would like to believe.

Coming back to Adilabad 1988--89, it
is not very easy to predict whether the
tribals would have attacked moneylenders
if they had not had the benefit of _naxalite_
leadership. The difficulty in understanding
popular consciousness even in face to face
conversation (let alone by reading official
postmortem reports) is that it expresses
itself in _socially legitimate_ terms, especially
when talking to government officials,
visiting scholars, civil liberties activists, or
a court of law. And government officials
writing reports on riots are also likely to
find extenuating circumstances --- if at
all --- within the framework of the _socially
legitimate_, if not as a matter of prudence
then because that is their own _social
morality_. The ease with which the
subaltern scholars have assumed that they
have no methodological difficulties in
understanding popular consciousness is a
little baffling even _to_ one who is not a professional
historian. When poor people in
a village beat up a landlord, they usually
have a hundred reasons for doing so, but
when they are questioned they usually lay
stress on acts like molestation of poor
women, for such acts are objects of social
opprobrium. Scholars then go on to conclude
that there is no land question or
class hatred but only 'honour' involved in
the struggle. The fact that every act of
rebellion is a penal offence makes the appeal
_to_ the prevailing social conscience
even more imperative. If a labourer who
his beaten up the master tells the inspector
who has arrested him that he committed
the crime because the master would
not give him leave of absence to go to a
fair or attend a wedding, the inspector is
likely to beat him up and deliver a lecture
in the bargain on how such laziness on the
part of the labouring classes is destroying
the nation's economy; but if he says he
wanted leave to attend his father's funeral,
the inspector --- if at all he is convinced --- is
likely to be more lenient. And what applies
to the severity of the inspector's reaction
applies also to the sympathy the
judicial magistrate will later on show
when the case comes up for trial. The
penal institutions are permeated by the
ideology of the _legitimate_, and rebellions
are punished as much for their illegitimacy
as for their lawlessness.

For the tribals of Adilabad who have
looted traders and moneylenders, living as
they do in an 'extremist-infested' area
where there was one 'encounter' killing
every week last year, the need, to find a
'legitimate' reason for the crimes they have
committed is much more serious. It is not
a matter of deliberate hypocrisy or sensible
policy, but a matter of locating their
class interest as far as possible within the
framework of the norms of _social morality_.
They certainly _do_ feel outraged that
though they have never defaulted on their
debts without paying the penalty and
more, the moneylenders have now refused
to come to their rescue in a time of crisis.
But more importantly they know that this
is an argument that will strike a chord of
sympathy in the heart of the inquisitive
journalist, the visiting scholar or the
government official; and may help to
soften the ire of the policeman. When one
talks to the tribals they begin with this
argument. As you go on conversing and
slowly reveal that there is something
slightly wrong with your own notions of
morality, they open up bit by bit. The
younger or the more audacious will suddenly
ask why the traders grow rich without
toiling one bit but the tribal who toils
all day starves; why some people should
have so much land and others none; why
the non-tribal settlers get title deeds for
their land so easily so that they can borrow
from the banks but the tribals have
to run to the moneylenders; why it is not
called theft or dacoity if the moneylender
collects double the loan amount at the end
of the year, but it is called theft and
dacoity if the tribals take back what was
originally theirs. At this point the elder
and the more conservative among them
are visibly upset by the trend of reasoning.
They react sharply and ask the impetuous
ones to keep quiet; there is no point --- they
say --- in lamenting the obvious. That is
how things are, because that is how they
were meant to be. This is the voice of the
dominant morality, but the younger ones
are not silenced. Their anger leaves the
accepted moral code way behind and
becomes distinctly seditious. What amount
and intensity of 'reading' of commissioners'
and collectors' reports on riots
and famines can reveal this illegitimate
dimension of popular consciousness is a
point well worth pondering.

However, all that may be, the _Gonds_,
_Kolams_ and _Lambadas_ of Adilabad started
attacking traders and moneylenders by
October 1988, and kept up the attacks
right down to this monsoon. The unhelpful
attitude of the moneylenders, and the
lack of any drought relief activity undertaken
by the government, forced them to
depend upon forest produce by the time
winter set in last year. They were soon living
on _mahua_ flowers[^mahua], bamboo-rice, and
poisonous tubers[^2]. _Mahua_ is consumed in
many forms, and bamboo-rice makes a
tolerable cereal, but the tubers require so
much effort to rid them of the poison that
the very fact that the tribals bother to collect,
cook and consume them indicates the
desperate straits the drought has reduced
them to. Here is a description of the collection
and preparation of the tubers,
published in a booklet issued by the _Girijan
Rytu Coolie Sangham_ (Tribal Peasant and
Agricultural Labourers Association):

>These tubers, called by the name
>_matigadda_ (_gadda_ is Telugu for tuber) are
>not cultivated. They are found wild in the
>forests. The wild animals, especially pigs,
>dig them up and eat them. There are six
>varieties of this man tuber: _kehekka mati_,
>_noska mati_, _kirsi mati_, _tetre mati_, _bondi
>mati_ and _nul mati_. The first two of the
>six are the most widely available, but unfortunately
> they are the poisonous varieties.
>The other four are not poisonous but
>they are not widely found.
>
>A wife-and-husband team can collect
>about one or two kgs if they search and
>dig a whole day. The tubers must then be
>cut into fine pieces and washed in flowing
>water for three days. Then they have
>to be boiled seven times. With each boiling
>some of the poison leaves the tubers
>and enters the water. The water must be
>thrown out and the tubers boiled again.
>After boiling seven times, the tubers must
>be washed in cold water and then boiled
>a last time. The whole process takes about
>five or six days. Only then the tubers
>become edible.

[^mahua]: The _mahua_ flower is edible and is a food item for tribals. They use it to make syrup for medicinal purposes, for making bread. The flowers are also fermented to produce the alcoholic drink _mahua_ --- a country liquor.

[^2]: Tuber is a fleshy, thickened underground stem of a plant, usually containing stored starch, for example a potato or arrowroot.

After so much treatment, it is unlikely
that there will be any nourishment left in
the food!

If such were the straits the men and
women were driven to, one need not describe
the travails of the animals. Selling
them in the weekly fair rid the tribals of
the burden of animals they could not feed,
and at the same time put in their hands
some money to buy food for themselves.
Whether, in such a situation, they would
themselves have thought of raiding the
shops and houses of moneylenders and
traders is a doubtful point, for there is no
record in recent history of the _Gonds_ of
Adilabad ever having undertaken such
adventures, but as it happens they were
not left to their devices.

As this year's monsoon came near, the
attacks on traders and moneylenders
became more frequent, for atleast two
reasons: one, that with the need to prepare
their lands for the _kharif_ crop they could
not any longer find the time to search the
forests for _mahua_ flower and tubers; and
two, that they needed _jowar_ seed to sow
the crop, and the easiest way of procuring
it was to steal it from the traders. The
announcement by the _Integrated Tribal
Development Agency_ (ITDA) that _jowar_
seed would be supplied on loan came very
late, well after many of the raids had
already taken place, perhaps _because_ the
raids had taken place. (This is no reflection
on the personal integrity of the officers
who staff the ITDA, some of whom
are the best administrative personnel the
state has.)

And then the police moved in. The state
government may take its own time to react
to ITDA's distress signals, and under the
head of relief, may grant only Rs 45 lakh
against the district collector's demand of
Rs 43 crore, but there is neither such tardiness
nor any shortage of funds when it
comes to the reaction of the police. The
police moved in fast and started arresting
hundreds of tribals under the _Terrorist
and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act
(TADA)_. About 160 tribals were arrested
in connection with the Dandepalli raid
alone, from the villages of Jainur, Narnur,
Sirpur and Tiriani _mandals_. The total arrests
under _TADA_ in connection with
these raids must be about 600. They were
all lodged in the far off prisons of
Nizamabad and Warangal (_there is no_
proper prison in Adilabad), and were put
to tremendous hardship in getting bail.
Many of them are yet to get bail. As it was
nearing monsoon time this year by the
time most of the arrests were made, they
lost the few crucial weeks when the
ploughing of the land and sowing takes
place. If they lost last year's crop because
of drought, they are likely to lose this
_kharif_ season's crop because of _TADA_. In
consequence that legislative monstrosity
has become familiar (it is pronounced
Ta-da, in two syllables) to the most illiterate
tribal. They probably took a long
time to say ITDA, but they have learnt to
say _TADA_ in a matter of weeks.

Adding to these the hundreds of tribals
of Khammam, East Godavari and
Visakhapatnam districts, arrested under
_TADA_ in recent months for sympathising
with, harbouring, sheltering, or giving
food to _naxalites_, the total tally of
NT Rama Rao, chairman of the _National
Front_ which is fighting these elections.
With the promise of providing a democratic
alternative to the authoritarian
regime of Rajiv Gandhi, is about 1000
tribals booked under _TADA_ in a matter
of one year and a little more. So much
then for Indian democracy and the alternatives
it offers.
