**Q**: _Your tour on behalf of the APCLC[^apclc] is obviously because of the urgency of the human rights
situation in Andhra Pradesh. So we would like to know your assessment of the present human
rights situation. How has it changed, become worse over the past decade or so?_

[^apclc]: Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee (APCLC).

\ 

**A**: It has become quite bad, I think, not only in Andhra Pradesh, but all over the country.
The capacity of the Indian State to be democratic has been decreasing very rapidly, not only
in terms of direct police repression, but also culturally, ideologically. In every sense the
Indian state is resorting to much more undemocratic means of dealing with the people and
people's movements. So, I think the situation is deteriorating very rapidly and requires very
urgent action by the Civil Liberties groups.

\ 

**Q**: _Do you think that there are special reasons for the erosion of legitimacy of the Indian
State, of late?_

\ 

**A**: I do not know whether I would use the word legitimacy. But in a way I think there are
special & not special, but there definitely are reasons for the degeneration of the Indian State
into a very authoritarian regime. I think for the first two decades or so , the Indian State
was in some kind of a position to at least create certain hopes among the people that their
aspirations would be satisfied, if not immediately, then, at least in the future. The Indian
State was also able to give some satisfaction to various sections of the elite that their
internal conflicts could be resolved peacefully. I think in both these aspects there has been a
deterioration of the situation. The elite, the various sections of the elite, the ruling classes
are quarrelling very severely among themselves, and also they are no longer able to create
much hope among the people and the reason why this is happened is a very complex reason
which is part of the economic and social politics followed by them and so on; but ultimate
consequence is that there is a total failure of what the Indian State likes to call patriotism ;
whereas practically nobody in this country is patriotic in the sense in which the Indian
State wants them to be patriotic, that is, nobody has any sense of identificational loyalty
with the system. In that situation the state seems to have only one option-that is to become
more repressive and more authoritarian.

\ 

**Q**: _Would you also say that the recent challenges --- well not so recent, but they have become
more articulate recently --- coming from say, Punjab, Assam and Kashmir have also led to this
increased authoritarianism?_

\ 

**A**: Well, the challenge is partly one of the manifestations of these situations and the crises I
have described and the very fact that these manifestations in certain parts have been very
militant and successful to some extent, has also led to the --- I won't say making the State
more authoritarian --- but it has led to a situation where the State becomes more decisive. It
has decided that it is no longer going to tolerate militant political dissent; of course, the
particular forms which have been used by these movements may also be partly responsible.
But I think, more than that, the very fact of a strong political dissent coming forward and
succeeding in making itself felt, in making its impact, that, I think has contributed a lot.

\ 

**Q**: _This being the situation, can human rights activity in any part of the country be politically
neutral, in other words how does one understand the violation of human rights in any
particular situation like, for instance, the Assam Rifles in Manipur. One cannot just talk
about certain kinds of violation without addressing the larger political issues in it?_

\ 

**A**: You see, human rights concept is political. But it is political in a very specific sense. It is
political in the sense that the Human Rights movement or the Civil Liberties movement
--- whatever one wants to call it --- takes a stand for the oppressed against the oppressors; for
the citizens against the State; for the less equal against the more equal and so on. This is one
level of politics. But there is a finer level of politics which involves programmes and
strategies and tactics, goals and ideologies. In that sense it is better for the civil liberties
movement not to be political. That is a distinction that we have always been making. So
when we say that a human rights movement is politically neutral, what we are saying is it is
neutral in the sense that the finer details of political strategies and ideologies --- as far as they
are concerned --- we try to be neutral; we have to be neutral, otherwise we cannot have broad
based human rights, civil liberties, democratic rights movement. But in the very basic sense
of taking a stand for those who are suppressed, in that sense definitely the movement is
political, it has to be political.

\ 

**Q**: _Would you say, then, that the Human Rights movement can be seen as a sort of
catalyst to bring these other larger political issues into focus?_

\ 

**A**: That is perhaps a very ambitious way of putting it, but definitely I think the
Human Rights Movement has been able to focus on the central question of oppression
without allowing it or without letting it get obfuscated by finer political differences and
details.

\ 

**Q**: _Now, I would like to move on to something else: Apart from your work of APCLC,
you have also been writing on a variety of subjects, especially when the whole debate about
Mandal came up, you wrote a very long and interesting article for the Economic and Political
Weekly. I want to ask you a few questions based on that. One thing is that one of the most
common criticisms of the Mandal Commission is that it will empower the already powerful
landed OBC's. This will result in further oppression of the Dalits and so on and so forth. Now
how would you respond to this kind of a criticism?_

\ 

**A**: Firstly, I think, very basically, we should see caste oppression as a separate category,
quite apart from the question of land, the question of economic relations and so on. So, for
instance, say the landless poor in Bihar --- where some of the backward castes have some
sections who are landlords --- definitely when it comes to fighting for land they will fight the
landlords who belong to the backward castes. But in the context of caste, as a caste, as
backward caste these people continue to be deprived, especially in the spheres of culture,
education, employment and so on. To put it much more concretely, I would say that the
fight of a landless labourer against a _Kurmi landlord_ in Bihar would definitely be justified.
One would not say he should not struggle because the man is a _Kurmi_, but if the same
_Kurmi landlord_'s son desires to become an IAS officer along with Brahmins and so on then
it is a legitimate demand which has to be defended. This is the point which has, I think been
completely ignored by many people who have forward this argument. Secondly it is not
really true that among the backward castes all over the country there is a very sizeable
landlord section. In Andhra practically there are very few backward caste landlords
excepting in the North coastal districts. I think it is a peculiarity of Bihar and Eastern U.P
which has been unnecessarily generalized to all over the country. It is in that part that there
are a few Backward caste landlords. I don't know about Tamil Nadu , but definitely it is not
true of Andhra and Karnataka, for example , with which I am a little familiar.

\ 

**Q**: _If it is not landlords, then , the argument runs, that, already for instance, in Tamil Nadu
the reservations have been in force for so many decades and the children of OBC's --- the first
generation of the learners --- are already in positions where they can get to be on their own and
so on and so forth. And also today they say that the Dravidian parties have put the OBC's in
leadership positions in the administration and so on, so why give them more leverage in the
political system. How would you respond to this?_

\ 

**A**: In this context, I think one argument that has come forward is that those who have had
reservations for one generation or two generations should be denied and so on. I think
when this argument comes from the poor people among those communities, it is an honest
argument. And secondly, barring a few communities --- I am going to talk about the Andhra
experience --- barring a few of the backward communities, among the others, the reality
today is that even the existing quota is not being filled. If you have five seats you find that
only three or four people are able to come and occupy them. In that case the question of the
rich among the community depriving the poor does not arise. It arises, only when five seats
are --- I mean when ten people come and whom do you give it to --- when it arises. So I would
say that at the present historical juncture it is too hasty to take a stand that it should not be
given to those who have already enjoyed it for one generation or two and secondly it
becomes an honest argument only when it comes from the poor among these classes and
not when it comes from the _forward classes_.

\ 

**Q**: _I want to return to something which you said a little while ago, that caste oppression is
something which has to be seen on its own. In this context I want to know how you see the
OBC-Dalit contradiction. You have already answered this in some sense but I want you to
respond to this in detail. There are some sections, for instance, especially the upper caste press
in Tamil Nadu which insists on viewing it as a primary problem in the whole gamut of class-caste
relations. So how would you relate this to the larger question of the caste system to the
power of Brahmins, to Brahminism and so on?_

\ 

**A**: The thing is when one considers caste as a separate question what is very important is
that those who are oppressed in the caste sense, in that sense, the _Dalits_ --- I would use it to
include also the Backward castes, because all of them are also oppressed in the caste
hierarchy --- a unity of all those communities is very essential. Otherwise, _Brahminism_ in
whatever form can not be fought and, therefore, to the extent that there is a contradiction
between the Backward castes, and the _Scheduled Castes_ and _Scheduled Tribes_, I think the
effort should be to see it, recognize it and try to remedy it and work for unity. And I think
that the _Dalit movement_ which earlier used to be Scheduled Caste movements are today
realizing the necessity --- at least in Andhra Pradesh the major Dalit organizations are
making conscious efforts to reach out to the Backward castes. And though the _Mandal
Commission_ was basically concerned directly only about the Backward castes, it was the
Dalit organizations, consisting almost exclusively of _Scheduled castes_, who are really took it
up and made it a major issue in Andhra. And the _Bahujan Samaj Party_ for example, apart
from the totality of its political understanding which may have faults, but conceptually its
idea that it should unite the _Scheduled castes_ and the _Backward castes_ against _Brahminism_
and _Forward caste_ domination has been a positive development. In that same direction it
should work.

And secondly, again talking of the Andhra experience, the contradiction between Backward
castes and _Scheduled Castes_ has not been very severe in Andhra. There the contradiction
has been between the so called _Sat Shudra Castes_ --- That is between the _Reddys_ and the
_Kammas_, the dominant _non-Brahmin_ forward castes and the _Dalits_. Once again, I think
the whole argument of the _Backward Castes versus the Dalits_ being very important, is an
unjustified extrapolation from Bihar and Eastern U.P. That is as far as I understand.

\ 

**Q**: _Now in Tamil Nadu, for instance, the recent political changes especially the rout of the
DMK in the recent elections and so on has created two kinds of problems. One is there has
been a revival of a very virulent kind of Brahminism. On the other hand there have also have
been responses like "The DK movement and the DMK never really represented a sizeable
section of the OBC's and even the Dalits. They only cater to the elite among the so called
Backward Castes and so on and so forth" Now in the context of this phenomenon how is it
going to be easy to forge a unity among the Dalits and the Backward Castes?_

\ 

**A**: Actually, obviously you see I do not really know about what the _DK_ did in Tamil Nadu
in the past, but if that is true then what is required is not merely to expect the _DK_ to
complete its job but other new organizations and new forces can come up. Well, for
example, here at least in Tamil Nadu you had genuine non-Brahmin movement in the form
of _DK_. In Andhra we had a _Justice Party_ which was not really even a genuine _non-Brahmin_
movement. It was just an elite _Reddy_ and _Kamma_ organization consisting of _Zamindars_. So
nobody today says that _Justice Party_ must continue the struggle for unity and , in fact, new
organizations came up and they have come up from the _Dalits_ --- from the _Scheduled
castes_ side --- other than even from the Backward Castes. It is a good thing. Whatever is the
past, to say that because they have not completed the job, the job can not be completed is a
ridiculous answer.

\ 

**Q**: _You had earlier noted that class struggle and caste struggle are co-terminus. I would like
you to elaborate on this a little more in terms of concrete details?_

\ 

**A**: One of the major failures of Marxist understandings in the past has been that it has
always regarded caste as part of the superstructure. I think only now people are
understanding that historically caste has always been part of the base. It was a production
relation. It has been very significantly a production relation. A very important ideological
weapon --- weapon of oppression, weapon of exploitation. In that sense especially when one
goes back into Indian history, it is impossible to talk of class without talking of caste. And it
is impossible to talk of caste without talking of class. Both would be equally wrong. Even
today for example, if you take any person living in a village and in terms of Marxist concept
of production relations, what are the means of production, the instruments of material life
available to a person? Invariably one has to note which is the caste of the person. Otherwise
you can not answer the question. If you are born as a _Dhobi_ the instrument of production
available to you is the _Dhobi ghat_, that is the tools of production available to you. If you
are born in a Barber's community the tools available to you are the Barber's knife and to
acquire other tools you will have to put up a fight collectively or individually or try through
reservations to get into college, get into a job. It has to be a fight. What is normally,
naturally available is definitely linked to the caste. So even today caste continues to be --- to a
significant extent an economic relation, a production relation. So in that sense it is
impossible to separate the two. And even if class is understood --- as many people
unfortunately do --- in purely economical, monetary terms --- rich, middle class, and poor --- even
in that sense of class there is a very strong correlation between --- even in that vulgar
sense of class --- there is a very strong correlation between class and caste. And there are also
many other dimensions. For example, we talk of trying to create a consciousness of being
workers, of being producers, those who produce wealth. Now the people themselves have
the consciousness of being a Barber, a _Dhobi_, a _Mala_, a _Madiga_ and so on. These are not
contradictory. Because consciousness of being a barber is also, in its own way,
consciousness of being a person who produces a certain service which contributes to social
wealth and for a long time Marxists have been unnecessarily hesitant about using that
consciousness of a Barber, of a _Dhobi_, of a Potter or something else, using it to build a
working class consciousness. I think it is very possible, though when it creates certain
contradictions between those castes one has to consciously work against it. But still it is
very much possible and after this rise of the _Dalit Movement_, which has been a nonMarxist
movement to begin with, I think, we have realized these possibilities, that it is a
very major, very easy way of mobilizing to create working class consciousness, whereas, if
you talk abstractly of worker or producer, it becomes more difficult to organize people. I
think there is a lot of potential here.

\ 

**Q**: _Also one significant strategy in anti-caste struggles has to be the ways we combat
Brahminism. Now how do you see the changing roles of the Brahminism and Brahminism in
our current socio-political system?_

\ 

**A**: I think I could link this to the first question you asked me and the first answer I gave.
The increasingly authoritarian mode of functioning of the Indian state includes not only
the police repression and military repression but also cultural authoritarianism, cultural
reaction, cultural conservatism and I think _Brahminism_ is becoming a very important
weapon both as a social relation and as an ideology; it has become a very important weapon
being used by the state. You can see it in the Jayalalitha phenomenon here; you can see it in
the BJP and the kind of acceptance it is getting all over the country which ten years ago was
not there. Ten years ago the BJP was not a really respectable party among the secular
middle-class. Today it is a respectable party. So I think _Brahminism_ as a social relation and
as an ideology has become very important. They are consciously spreading it through
_Doordarshan_. For example, take the _Chanakya_ serial --- I have just seen a few episodes but it
is so explicitly Brahminical and directly linked to the present concern for national
unity or integrity; i.e. , _Brahminism_ as an ideological force and a social relation, the force
for national unity, integrity against Punjab, against Kashmir, against Assam, against
_Naxalites_, against _LTTE_, that is a very major phenomena. I think the struggle is therefore
not a struggle against _Brahmins_ or _Brahminism_, but part of as total struggle for democracy.

\ 

**Q**: _Now, One thing is that in Tamil Nadu, unlike, say in Maharashtra or even West Bengal,
Brahmins have been notoriously unself-critical. They have not displayed any kind of criticism
about their own role in the hierarchy of caste. So this being the case it has led to a certain
kind of polarization in progressive Non-Brahmin movements. You have certain kinds of
movements which say we cannot admit Brahmins of whatever opinion, political opinion or
political shade, to belong to the party. Now do you see this kind of phenomenon anywhere
else, in Andhra say, Brahmins who claim that they have decastified themselves. Where will
they fit into these progressive movements?_

\ 

**A**: I think this debate has always been there. When you struggle against _Brahminism_ does a
_Brahmin_ have a right to struggle against _Brahminism_?. Now since I myself am a Brahmin
by birth, definitely I do believe that --- otherwise I would have no social role for myself and
definitely I think it is unfair also, to reject the right to fight against a culture, rarely because
you are born in a particular caste. It is perpetuating caste in reverse. And secondly,
elsewhere also this debate is there. But at least in Andhra Pradesh maybe because of the
long Communist history it has not become a serious problem. Occasionally we do have
these discussions. For example, the _Dalit Maha Sabha_ meetings to begin with --- sometime
ago they would not allow anyone who is _Brahmin_ by birth to speak at the meeting. But
subsequently they have been allowing and asking many of our Civil liberties people who
happen to be _Brahmins_ by birth to address their meetings and we have been addressing. So
I think here ultimately the main responsibility lies on the _Brahmins_, that is those _Brahmins_
who would like to be democratic, those who would like to join the masses, they have to
demonstrate that it is not merely a question of declaring that they have given up there caste.
It has to be proved. It has to be accepted by other people. It is not enough if you declare.
The way you deal with people, the way you work, the kind of political activity you indulge
in, the stands you take, have to be such. It is the same thing anywhere. Say for example if a
man has to be accepted by feminists, by women who are conscious of their rights, it is not
enough if he declares that I also accept women as equals. He should be able to prove it in
his behavior. So the burden of all these cases lies on all those who are heirs to historical, say,
positions and situations of dominance. The burden of proof is on them and they have to
prove it.

\ 

**Q**: _One other related question. In Tamil Nadu, Ramasamy Periyar was instrumental in
yoking the Gender and caste questions together. He very clearly saw that women were the
bearers of tradition in most instances and that caste hierarchy is kept in place by women in
the domestic space. Now how do you see the linking of the womens struggle and the caste
question?_

\ 

**A**: The linking comes very naturally, especially because apart from sexual subordination,
the subordination of women's labor to the needs of men is a very major aspect. As far as the
labor part of it goes there is no difference between that and the subordination of the labor
of the _Shudras_ and the _Panchamas_ to the interests of the _forward castes_. The linking is
conceptually quite easy. Socially, politically it has yet to become very significant, because
the women's movement still has to go such deeper. Just as the _Dalit movement_ the _non-Brahmins_
movement, once stated with the upper caste _non-Brahmins_, and has become a
significant movement among the _Dalits_. Similarly, the women's movement as a women's
movement must become a significant force among the poor and the laboring class of
women. Till now --- it is not meant as a criticism but as an historical evaluation --- it is still
confined to the middle-class. Definitely it is good. It is good in the sense that they are
educated persons, and they are becoming conscious and talking about it. But when it takes
the next step and goes into the laboring classes and if the laboring women become
conscious not only as laborers but also as women, then I think the unity will become much
more easy. So I think it is a historical step rather than a conceptual difficulty right now.

\ 

**Q**: _This new understanding about Caste and Gender, how do you see it reflected in the left
movement in Andhra Pradesh, for instance?_

\ 

**A**: As far as issues are concerned the left, especially I am talking about the _CPI-ML groups_,
have been responding quite well. The Dalit movement especially has a very good relation
with the _ML_ groups and _ML_ groups with them. Though naturally as in all organizations
there are many ego problems and other kinds of irrelevant dissonance. But conceptually, I
am yet to come across any serious Marxist analysis by any _CPI-ML groups_ --- theoretical
analysis --- which shows how to integrate the caste question or the gender question within
the new democratic revolution they believe in. Issuewise they are responding. They are
fighting. Some of the _CPI-ML groups_ have very good women's organizations for talking up
the question of rape, not only rape by policemen, but rape by any man, as a major political
issue. I think it is an incomplete political process as of now.

\ 

**Q**: _I want to move to something else. It seems to many of us that one of the most pressing
issues of our times has to do with the nationalities question. And I would like your opinion on
the nationalities question as it exists in India today, especially your opinion on the various
militant groups as they are operating in Punjab, Assam and Kashmir and also how do you
see the future of such struggles?_

\ 

**A**: My own opinion of the nationalities question ahs always been a little idiosyncratic. So
I'll just explain it. I think among the various nationalities which populate this country --- I
would conceptually divide them into the mainstream nationalities and the peripheral
nationalities. Today there is nationality consciousness both among the mainstream
nationalities, and the peripheral nationalities. Peripheral nationalities, I would say, are
those which have never been historically, socially, culturally part of India but have been
included for various accidental reasons unconnected with their will or desire, like
Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, even Kashmir. Now their struggles, I think are just struggles
to undo what was artificially done; to go back' to go out of the country. And one should
give unconditional support to those movements, the Eastern Indian Tribal struggles as well
as Kashmir. As far as the mainstream Andhra or Tamil or Kerala of Marathis, Hindi and so
on, here I think one should be very conscious of the social , political nature of the
nationality movements.

In Punjab, my own belief is that is a very reactionary, politically very reactionary
movement. So there one has to be very clear about which political outlook in leading the
nationalists movement. See, when we accept the nationalities question as a basic question
when we accept the necessity --- if it comes to that --- of each nationality becoming separate,
we are not delinking it from the political nature of the forces which are speaking in the
name of that nationality. And one has to be very conscious about that when it comes to the
mainstream nationalities. Whereas with the historically peripheral nationalities, I think
that in Kashmir, among the Muslims of Kashmir, there is nobody who is not a separatist
today and that is because they were artificially dragged into this country. They wanted to
escape Pakistan's oppression and joined India, whereas their own desire was always for an
independent Kashmir.

\ 

**Q**: _I want to discuss this whole thing of mainstream nationalities in some detail. Though, in
some sense, the nationalities you mentioned like Andhras, Tamils, Punjabies, and so on are
apart of a composite culture, till a hundred years ago, politically they have never been part of
any greater Indian State, of any greater Indian nationalism; especially, Tamil Nadu which
ahs always remained peripheral to all the empires that were formed in the Gangeric Plains.
So maybe there are even within mainstream nationalities, mainstream in the sense they
belong to a composite culture, degrees of alienation from this greater India that we have
today?_

\ 

**A**: That is correct. I am not denying the degrees of alienation but only questioning who is
speaking in the name of that alienation. This is a very vital question because apart from
culturally and socially having some amount of integration, there is also the question that
during the British period and subsequently, these mainstream nationalities have
participated in the domination of the country.

Tamils, Telugus, Marathis and Punjabis have all jointly --- the upper sections of these
nationalities --- have all jointly ruled this country. They have collaborated with the Britishers
in ruling this country together and they continue to rule this country together; in the
Bureaucracy; among the Capitalists, among the landlord class, in the military and so on.
This is also a fact which has to be taken into account. Not only the past cultural
homogeneity or integration. Keeping this in mind, I think that when someone says that we
are speaking for Tamil nationality or Punjabi nationality or Andhra nationality one has to
see whether it is N.T. Rama rao or somebody else. One cannot to be supported. I do not
think it should be supported, that is the argument.

\ 

**Q**: _coming back to Tamil Nadu. Here the question of Tamil nationality was first articulated
by the Dravidian movement and later on taken over by DMK though it was used for very
many opportunistic purposes by the DMK. But today in Tamil Nadu, you have a lot of small
groups operating with small magazines, and so on , and reaching out to students sometimes,
sometimes to larger communities and which are addressing the question of self-determination.
For instance there is the Tamil Nadu unit of the MCPI which has formed a
party on its own. So this being the case do you also see that there is some kind of contradiction
emerging among the mainstream nationalities which will, maybe, in the future bring to the
fore certain genuine progressive elements which will champion the cause of this nationalism?_

\ 

**A**: Very concretely, I would say that a nationality movement even within these mainstream
nationalities which takes the land question as a central question and related it to other
land-related and other oppression --- related social relations and structure, if such a
movement comes forward, I do not know about the groups in Tamil Nadu, but if it is true
then definitely it will enter into a contradiction with dominant mainstream nationalism. In
which case it will be a good development.

\ 

**Q**: _How do you view the demand for separate Asom?_

\ 

**A**: They are not only demanding a separate Asom. In fact nobody can demand only a
separate Asom. They can demand it only along with a certain social structure. Now the
Asom movement always had a very heavy tenor of upper caste Hindu, anti-Muslim
ideology. When the Asom movement came up in 1980, I think, I was the first one to
criticize it, and we had a long discussion and debate in Andhra also, because ML groups are
supporting it. I still feel that there is a strong Hindu communal, anti-Muslim content even
in _ULFA_, from what one sees from a distance at least. Unless one goes there, one may not
be able to fully know. But that is my feeling. That is why I said in these nationalities, one
has to go deep into what they represent, what they are talking about, whom they represent.
Otherwise, we will be only doing injustice to the country. It is my feeling.

\ 

**Q**: _One final question. Apart from land issues and so on which are so central to this
nationality struggles it also seems that it is necessary to put forth a sort of composite kind of
identity. One cannot simply demand that in Khalistan only the Sikhs will have a say in its
political affairs or in Asom it will be only upper caste Hindus?_

\ 

**A**: It is the part of a total ideology for example in _Khalistan_ unlike in Kashmir. For a long
time --- I do not know what Hizbul Mujahideen is saying today --- but for a long time
Kashmir nationalism has been secular. Even the name of the _Muslim Conference_ was
consciously, deliberately changed to _National Conference_ by Shaik Abdullah. Whereas
_Khalistan movement_, right now, has become quite communal so that is also part of one's
evaluation; part of the things one takes into consideration while evaluating. And the kind
of restrictions they are putting on women, for example, which unfortunately is coming up
even in Kashmir, that they should not wear certain kinds of dress and so on. All this is a
part of whether the movement is going to lead to a more democratic society or not. One has
to take into consideration all this when one is evaluating politically.
