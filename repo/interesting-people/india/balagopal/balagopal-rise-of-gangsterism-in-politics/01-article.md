One does not go to a convention against
fascism to get hold of a definitive analysis
of fascism. One goes there to see what
fascism means and does to people of different
modes of existence, and how --- and
how effectively --- they are resisting it. By
linking up these different pictures an integrated
view of the emerging fascist
trends can be had, which is about as much
as one can scientifically hope to have right
now, for in a situation where the resistance
to fascism is way behind the evil, any
claim to more than a working theory of
it would be epistemologically suspect.

The anti-fascist convention held at
Trichur in Kerala on January 14 and 15,
attended by delegates from Kerala, Tamil
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and West
Bengal, served this purpose rather well,
given all the limitations inherent to our
cultural and political history and
geography. To speak only of the
geography, Kerala --- which ranks high in
the export of working people to other
states and countries --- is poorly served by
the communications infrastructure of the
Indian railways: one has to run around a
lot of irrelevant territory to reach the state
(to give a striking illustration, the journey
from Warangal to Trivandrum takes as
much time as that from New Delhi to
Warangal). Indian capital --- for all its
pretensions to entrepreneurship and protestations
of suppression at the hands of
socialist ideology --- has no use for this
munificently offered labour power, which
therefore ends up supplying and washing
dishes in tea-shops. And since the petty-commodity
service sector is not influential
enough to affect the capital expenditure
of the government of India, it will
always remain difficult and tiresome to get
in or out of Kerala, though hundreds and
thousands of people keep doing so every
day.

# LATEST MASS-GOD

And as if this limitation of political
geography is not enough, in this season
the journey is made even more tiresome
by the rush of black-clothed and ritually
unkempt-looking pilgrims going to
Sabarimalai, the resort of Ayyappa, the
latest mass-god of Hinduism, who nevertheless
shares with the earliest the
attribute of a dubious parentage. The
myth of his parentage is typical of Siva-Vishnu
syncretism, but that syncretism
cannot explain the sudden popularity of
the god in late twentieth century south
India, where neither _Saivism_ nor
_Vaishnavism_ is of any sociological consequence,
though cults of both the sects
abound. The reasons are more modern,
and both the reasons for the popularity
and the changes the cult has undergone
in recent years are of relevance to our concern
with fascism. The cult --- at least in
Andhra --- first attracted individual
maverick elements of the urban lower
middle classes/backward communities,
and exclusively men at that. There was no
ritual but only the putting on of black
clothes, beads around the neck, unkempt
beards and bare feet. Individually, most
of the converts were of the problem-type:
the type who have and give problems
wherever they are. They would say on
questioning that they have found solace
and the problems are sorting themselves
out --- though there are no reported
miracles --- after taking the _deeksha_, which
entails the foregoing apparel and the
shunning of drink and sex, culminating
in a final visit to Sabarimalai around
_Makarasankramanam_ time. But solace --- as
a psychological consequence of faith --- explains
nothing, for they need not have
turned to a new god for that: they could
have had their pick of a variety of
established and organised cults. Temples
to _Brahminised_ deities --- Rama, Siva and
Vishnu in the form of _amsas_ like
Venkateswara --- abound all over the state,
and so do the cults of the more 'popular'
Anjaneya and the preponderantly
autochthonous mother-goddesses. And
the cults range all the way not only along
the Brahminical-autochthonous spectrum,
but also along the private-mass spectrum.

While discourses on _Upanishadic_ introspection
can be heard in some temple
or the other on any day, at the other end,
the mother-goddess cults are wild enough
to appeal to those sociologists who find
it possible to describe the masses in their
collectivity as mobs and herds. And so the
reason for the spread of the Ayyappa cult
goes beyond personal psychological needs.

The lower middle class of the overwhelmingly
tertiary sector economy of
urban India is a substantial and growing
class. In all the states, it is the tertiary sector
whose share in the regional product
is increasing. But given the essentially
perverse and even then stunted nature of
this development, the class, for all its
growth, is unsure and insecure. It carries
with it a strong sense of alienation, oppression
and frustration. This oppression
is not a private feeling that could seek
relief in familiar cults, but a _class_
phenomenon: oppression by the system
and alienation _from_ the system; the
frustration therefore must necessarily find
its outlet in something that is outside the
establishment, preferably even anti-establishment,
at least in its symbols and
its idiom. The art forms they patronise,
the magazines they read, the street gangs
they join, the mafias they support and the
cults they are attracted to are all at the
fringe of or outside the establishment.

# APPROPRIATION OF CULTS

Yet, it is possible to be 'outside' the
establishment only in a metaphorical
sense, in the sense of being outside the
normative standards proclaimed by the
establishment; in a real sense it is no more
possible to be outside the system than it
is possible to live outside the universe.
There is no space outside a totality; that
is an ontological maxim. You may resist
its norms, you may even resist its
philosophical idiom, or you may only
resist its control, but there is no running
away from it. And even if individuals
sometimes cheat themselves into believing
the contrary, the establishment knows
this very well. And what it does to
phenomena --- the gangs, the media, the
cults and the movements --- that are 'outside'
the establishment is to suppress
them/profit from them/co-opt them. The
first becomes necessary only in the case
of self-consciously anti-establishment
phenomena; for vague and undirected
frustrations the second and the third are
more sensible reactions. And it is a
historical characteristic of the Indian State
and society that it is eminently adept at
such sensible stratagems, an ability that
is extremely relevant when we are discussing
fascism. And thus the Ayyappa cult,
which first attracted (in Andhra, at any
rate) the frustrated elements among the
lower middle classes, because --- even
though it borrows some myths and symbols
from Brahminism --- it is recognisably
outside the Brahminical cultural establishment,
which in turn is itself an integral
element of the Indian State's ideological
establishment, quickly gets integrated into
that very system.

From being the eccentricity of maverick
problem-youth, it first becomes the
religion of the whole family, and then an
acceptable religion for a whole class.
Women too take to this hitherto all-male
cult, and the elderly parents who earlier
grumbled about the train fare to Kottayam
now put on black clothes and go along
with the youth. And the middle and upper
middle classes pick up the cult, so that
the black robes begin to lose their dirty
look and acquire a black or deep blue
sheen. Parallelly, the Brahmins devise a
new ritual for the Sabarimalai trip.
Hitherto, it was merely a question of buying
a ticket and getting into the train; now
the wife and husband have to submit to
an elaborate seeing-off ritual complete
with Brahmins chanting seemingly vedic
mantras into which supplications to the
latest god have been miraculously woven.
In a couple of years the cult will either die
out of sheer boredom or will become
as acceptable as that of the _Lord of the
Seven Hills_, and the social misfits of the
urban _mohallas_ will have to seek a new
god and a new cult.

Either of the ends would be peaceful,
but in a different situation and a different
context, a not altogether peaceful
assimilation could be imagined: given, say,
a preponderance of Muslims or Sikhs and
the kind of volatile conditions created by
the Ayodhya controversy or the murder of
Indira Gandhi, it is easy to imagine the
arming of the Ayyappa devotees --- each
one of them is an _amsa_ of the lord, it is
to be remembered with the _trisul_ and the
chakra of the lord's syncretic parents --- and
of course, more serviceable weapons
for practical use --- and their setting out to
save the very same Hindu dharma which
would not allow most of these devotees
even a decent rebirth in the normal course
of things.

# HOODLUMS, LEGISLATORS, MARTYRS

But the utility of lower middle class
misfits to fascism does not end with the
appropriation of their cults for communal
purposes. Each one of the modes of expression
of the frustration can be appropriated
and put to use. The establishment
press can itself turn yellow, a hesitant
shade at first and a deeper tint soon
as confidence grows; the establishment art
and literature can itself turn _lumpen_ and
violate all the canons of artistic values,
social responsibility and personal morality
proclaimed by the establishment itself;
and finally the street gangs can be appropriated
and adorned with the hallowed
symbols of parliamentary democracy:
hoodlums become legislators, their gang
fights become political battles, their
murder becomes national news, and in
their death they become martyrs in the
cause of socialism, national integrity or
Telugu pride. This dimension of the problem
of fascism, which was lightly touched
upon by the speakers at the Trichur
convention, is well illustrated by recent
happenings in Andhra.

Vangaveeti Mohana Ranga Rao
(Ranga, for short) begins his life in a communist
taxi-drivers' union; there is an
unverified rumour that at one point he
was even inspired by the call of _Naxalbari_.
But soon he turns into a hoodlum under
the leadership of his elder brother, the late
Radha (the full name was Radhakrishna).
The gang soon splits into two, one under
the leadership of the Vangaveeti brothers
and the other under the leadership of the
Devineni brothers, Gandhi and Nehru (as
their hopeful parents named them:
Gandhi was murdered some years ago and
Nehru is now in jail on charge of having
got Ranga murdered). The influx into
Vijayawada of agrarian wealth and the
profits from agro-based processing and
trade, which finds no better outlet than
real estate and finance, offers a fecund
basis for such hoodlums: the murky
underworld of shady real estate and
finance deals is second only to bootlegging
and smuggling as a base for the operation
of mafias.

This much is nothing out of the way,
and of not much significance in a discussion
on fascism. But soon the crisis in the
politics of the ruling classes intervenes. A
precondition for the viability of _bourgeois_
democratic forms of governance is that
the ruling classes should be able to settle
their problems amicably, and that they
should be able to convince the masses to
submit to oppression with good humour.
When either of them --- or both, as in India
now --- breaks down, fascist forms of
governance take over. Street gangs then
acquire political significance. With the
emergence of the _Telugu Desam Party_ --- signifying
the break-down of amity among
the ruling classes --- the hoodlums of
Vijayawada become political leaders.
Ranga becomes a _Congress(I)_ MLA and
Nehru becomes a _Telugu Desam_ MLA.
Their mutual killings thereafter become
serious affairs. When Murali, a younger
brother of the Devineni faction, is axed
to death --- along with four followers of the
faction --- at the time of the elections to the
co-operative societies last year, the TDP
goes on a rampage --- minor, compared to
what the Congress did this time --- on the
streets of Vijayawada. Ranga is accused
of having planned the murder, and spends
some weeks in jail While in jail he realises
that it could well be his turn next (a fact
which none of his ostentatious mourners
would like to admit today), and realises
further that being a _Congress(I)_ legislator
is not enough security. None of the
Andhra Congress leaders who are now
making capital of his dubious martyrdom
had ever entertained any feeling other
than of distrust and a version for him.
They themselves lacked anything resembling
a mass base, and they distrusted this
hoodlum's image as a rebel. He could incite
slum-dwellers to grab urban land, he
could incite rickshaw-pullers against the
traffic police, and he could protect the
_lumpen proletariat_ from the corrupt
policemen --- things which a Vengal Rao or
a Rajasekhar Reddy, inhibited by their
feudal past, or a Shiv Shanker, inhibited
by his past as a high court judge, could
not do with equal aplomb. And so Ranga
decided while in jail that he would have
to enlarge his mass base further and give
it a greater colour of legitimacy. He chose
the _Kapu_ caste as the appropriate identity,
for the caste --- or rather the castes, for
there are many castes which call
themselves _Kapu_ in the generic sense has
a wide presence among the peasantry
and urban lower middle classes all over
the state; and the fact that there is a
substantial _Kapu_ landowning and business
elite in the Krishna and more so the
Godavari deltas, which would also find
the mobilisation in the name of the _Kapus_
useful for the furtherance of their own interests,
only helped him. He convened
assemblies of the _Kapus_ at many places
in the Godavari and Krishna deltas; each
of these _kapunadus_ (_nadu_ is an old dravidian
word which denotes a territory as
well as an assembly which is
territorially --- or even communally, as in
this case --- delimited) was attended by
thousands of people, and soon other
_Kapu_ notables started identifying with it.

And yet he was killed. He and his gang
were hounded by the _Telugu Desam_'s
policemen until he felt really insecure, to
the point of going on a hunger strike with
the demand that he be given protection;
his prayer was not only ignored, but he
was attacked while on protest and
murdered in a most brutal and dastardly
fashion. And whoever may have been the
actual perpetrators of the crime, it is difficult
to believe that the top leaders of the
_Telugu Desam Party_ did not have prior
knowledge --- at the least --- of it; the
extraordinary amount of violence, that
followed his killing is itself proof that the
act could not have been done casually.
The violence has been described as
looting, plunder and caste-conflict by the
press. But to closer observation, it contained
many strands. A marked element
was the class hatred that the vulgar new
rich of coastal Andhra have brought in
their wake; it was their exhibitionist wealth
that was made the target of destruction.
In the beginning, the rioters pointedly,
destroyed the costliest and the most garish
of the looted goods, and took home only
the articles of common use. A second
strand was the _anti-Kamma_ violence to
which both sides had equally contributed:
NTR by visibly favouring the _Kamma_
caste in the distribution of spoils, and the
Congressmen by whipping up caste-hatred
on this score. A third strand was the
general eruption of popular frustration.
And the last was the organised rioting
engineered by Congressmen and Ranga's
henchmen. It is said that in one street of
Vijayawada alone --- named after Annie
Besant --- about Rs 100 crore worth of property
was looted or destroyed; but then
how many streets exist in the towns of this
country wherein a few hours' rioting can
destroy or despoil property and goods
worth Rs 100 crore? It is meaningless to
indulge in moral horror exclusively at
those forms of plunder that are prohibited
by the Indian Penal Code.

But --- to get back to the theme of
fascism --- when hoodlums and their gang
fights become an integral part of ruling
class politics, the consequences for the
people go well beyond a few days' rioting.
All of the consequences need not be
charted out, but there is one dimension
that must be commented upon, and that
is the gradual demise of every one of the
institutions of _bourgeois democracy_.
These institutions have never been particularly
strong or democratic in our
country, but what little vitality or
democracy they ever had is being drained
out parallelly with the rise of gangsterism
in politics. The law, the courts, the press
and the administration, are all being subjected
to this destruction.

This destruction attracted a lot of attention
at the Trichur convention. Indeed,
the 59th Amendment to the Constitution,
which restores to the emergency provision
its original attribute of being a lethal hatchet
of formal democracy, an attribute
which had been softened earlier under the
pressure of the revulsion that the internal
Emergency promulgated by Indira
Gandhi had given rise to, was the figurative
sub-title of the theme of the convention.

But a hatchet is not the best weapon for
the use of judicious force, and so a
number of other legislative enactments
and amendments have been brought forward
in recent times to curb the formal
rights available to industrial workers,
white-collar employees, press people and
of course political activists. Indeed, the
decade of the eighties has been punctuated
by such enactments: three amendments
to the National Security Act, extension
of the Suppression of Disturbances
Act and the Armed Forces (Special
Powers) Act to Punjab, the Terrorist Affected
Areas (Special Courts) Act, the Terrorist
and Disruptive Activities (Prevention)
Act, the Trade Unions and Industrial
Disputes (Amendment) Bill, the Hospitals
and Other Institutions (Redressal of
Grievances) Bill, the Defamation Bill, the
Postal Bill, etc. It may be thought that
such 'black laws' have never been required
to suppress the people, and therefore, as
a corollary, that an anti-fascist movement
need not bother too much about such
legal fictions: after all, it required no Act
for the Suppression of Seditious Cultural
Activities to murder Safdar Hashmi, nor
the enactment of the Defamation Bill to
murder Umesh Dhobal or Pingali
Dasaratharam. But that is a superficial
way of looking at things: one obvious
reason is that the rights that are formally
taken away by these enactments are not
inconsequential paper statutes, but the
fruits of hard-won victories. Secondly, the
law is not merely a norm of social conduct
supported by the sanction of the
State apparatus; the law is also an
_ideology_. To be lawful is not merely to
conform to the norms written down in the
law codes; to be lawful is to be right, proper,
moral _just_. If the norms delimit
lawful behaviour, then the ideological
connotations of 'lawful behaviour'
legitimises those norms, raise them to a
level of righteousness well above the
positivist meaning attached to the word
norm in the formal sense. When the
policeman catches somebody else on the
wrong side of the road, you do not merely
feel relieved that it was not you that was
caught, you also feel righteous. It is this
legitimacy that the State seeks when it
enacts what we call 'black laws'. If Safdar
Hashmi had been sentenced to life imprisonment
under an Act for the Suppression
of Seditious Cultural Activities (there
is nothing fantastic about the notion: section
4 of TADA decrees a life sentence for
anyone who merely propagates or prophesizes
that a region of India is going to
cede or secede), then not a tenth of these
tears would have been shed for him, and
that is what makes such enactments
dangerous. And that is why, even as we
may like to campaign against death
sentences as a matter of principle, it is
necessary and right to keep saying again
and again that Kehar Singh's execution
was a terribly unfair act even under existing
rules and traditions of criminal
trials. Even as our central task is to fight
the real violation of real rights, a critique
of and a struggle against the formal violation
of formal rights is also important.
The rights have got formal recognition in
the law only because they have real
recognition in the hearts of the masses,
and therefore to rule the masses without
recognising the rights would be impossible.
And equally, when it becomes
necessary to violate the rights, it is
preferable to enact the violation as formal
laws, so that the legitimacy that attaches
to law _as such will_ give whatever justification
that is possible for the violation.

A third dimension, which was discussed
perhaps more extensively than the first
two, is the political-social-economic
background to developing fascism. There
is no need to describe in detail all the problems
that the ruling classes are facing,
nor the fact that they are unable to find
a satisfactory solution to any of them.
What is relevant is that the solutions they
are attempting --- like 'liberalisation' of the
economy, and patchwork accords for
political crises --- are of such nature as to
be incompatible with the minimum
respect for the people's rights. And so
each one of the hard-won rights of the
people is being taken away both statutorily
and by extra-legal suppression. In the so-called
'high-wage island' big industry,
there is not only the ongoing retrenchment
in the name of rationalisation, but there
is also a growing tendency to contract out
a substantial part of the work, so that
many big industrial units --- both in the
public sector and the private sector --- undertake
the manufacture of only the
core of the product and get everything else
done on contract by private contracting
units, which use low-paid labour --- often
that of women and children --- for the purpose.
The white-collar middle class faces
a restricted employment situation both in
the industrial sphere and in the administrative
sphere. If this is the situation
faced by the most advanced sections of
the people, the condition of the others
needs no elaboration. Any resistance from
the masses must therefore be suppressed
brutally. The currently pending bills
restricting the right of association and collective
struggle of industrial workers and
white-collar employees, is only the formal
tip of the iceberg. Underneath is hidden
the monster of brute force, symbolised by
the machine-gun toting policeman who is
visible all over the country today.

The only hope is the resistance that the
people have been expressing time and
again, ana their capacity for not only uncontrolled
outbursts but also disciplined
and organised protest, the kind of
discipline and dedication that was very
much in evidence in the organisation of
the Trichur convention. It would be
cheating oneself to believe that the
resistance is strong enough to overcome
the fascist onslaught; but then it is only
by courageously facing the onslaught that
resistance can strengthen itself.
