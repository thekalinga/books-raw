Come election season, real and imaginary alliances are the staple of political pastime.
Cinema heroes are routinely rumoured to be ready to jump in, a doubtful consummation
that their cold feet in the end saves society from. Communities deprived of power come
together to ask themselves for the umpteenth time what could be the answer to the
arithmetic conundrum: their votes are the most numerous but their place in the mansions
of power is the least numerous. The conundrum is too often sought to be answered
arithmetically: if these communities come together and set up their own candidates and
vote for them, they can rule the country. That quite intelligent people find satisfaction in
this apolitical calculus is depressing.

It is true that a few communities are dominating decision-making processes in the polity.
_Reddys_ and _Kammas_ are being bracketed as the two communities enjoying all the power,
but the grouse of _Brahmins_ and _Vaishyas_ that they too are excluded is ridiculous. They
find it convenient to pretend ignorance of the fact that as many matters are decided in the
Secretariat and the portals of business as in the Cabinet. The bureaucracy continues to be
_Brahmin_ dominated, as also all the elite educational institutions, a considerable section of
the media and the high-growth private corporate sector. It is true that there is no absolute
monopoly in any of these areas as in the past, but that is not the same thing as
powerlessness. Similarly, while business may no longer be the complete monopoly of the
_Vaishyas_, their presence can hardly be said to be negligible in that important fount of
power.

The grievance of the SC, ST and BC communities and the religious minorities in this
matter is genuine. However, it is not going to be answered by adding up numbers and
counting the seats they could fetch if the numbers did add up. There are two and probably
three 'ifs' here. The communities, as communities, should come together; they should
overwhelmingly vote for their own; and those who are thus elected should serve them
rather than the privileged classes. The fact that these communities are placed in one big
bracket by the ideology of _chaturvarna_ does not guarantee any of these consequences. It
requires hard work to create a sense of one-ness and political commitment to that
identity. It first of all requires overcoming the very real gap between BCs and _Dalits_, and
the Muslims and all the rest. Such work cannot start one year before elections and end on
the day the votes are counted, to resurface again come the next election.

Since hope of easy solutions will not die easily, the '_Mayawati formula_' seems to have
caught the imagination of the politically lazy among the _Dalit_ leaders. It is astonishing
that the notion of '_Sarva Jana Samaj_' is believed to be a novelty. In divided societies, any
notion of '_all_' is presumptively ideological. It serves to hide the fissures in society. In fact
Jyotiba Phule's concept of _Bahujan_ sets off the ideological character of _Sarvajan_. It is sad
that popular _Dalit_ leaders need to be taught such elementary lessons in political
philosophy.

But then poverty of philosophy has always been the bane of would-be radical
movements, and an acute sense of this weakness has always been the strength of ruling
classes. In Uttar Pradesh, at least, there was an excuse for Mayawati's illusion that she is
leading the _Misras_ and the _Pandeys_, namely that she has a genuine base among the _Dalits_.
She will nevertheless discover one day that while she thinks she is using them, it is they
in fact who will be using her. That _Dalit_ and BC leaders of Andhra Pradesh whose mass
base is just about good enough for a _panchayat sarpanch_'s post find it possible to reason
likewise, however, is not excusable naïveté but sad proof of the human capacity for self-deception.
