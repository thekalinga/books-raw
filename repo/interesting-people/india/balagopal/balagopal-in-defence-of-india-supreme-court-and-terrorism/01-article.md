_The Supreme Court's judgment on TADA in the Kartar Singh vs State of
Punjab case has taken the law back to the pre-1978 days, though, to be fair,
this is not the only occasion when the Supreme Court has set the calendar
back._

\ 

Justice Ratnavel Pandian's judgment (on
behalf of the majority) in _Kartar Singh vs
State of Punjab_ has set the Constitutional
seal on _TADA_. It is a poorly written judgment,
poor in language --- because it is poor in
judicial philosophy and not merely because
of the judge's poor command of English
--- poor in logic and poor for its unwillingness
to follow the path opened up by the _Supreme
Court_ in 1978 in _Maneka Gandhi vs Union
of India_. Justice Sahai, in his dissenting
judgment, says if the Additional Solicitor
General's arguments in defence of _TADA_
that "if they are accepted, that will result in
taking the law back to _A K Gopalan_", i.e.,
the _Supreme Court_'s view in _A K Gopalan
vs State of Madras_, 1950. The judge is too
polite to say the same of the reasoning of
'brother Pandian' whose erudition (of which
there is really little trace in the judgment)
he praises copiously. But hiscomment applies
equally to the majority judgment, with which
he too is in significant measure in agreement.
Without at any point saying so, it takes the
law back to the pre-1978 days, though, to
be fair, this is not the only occasion when
the _Supreme Court_ has set the calendar back.

Terrorism is a reality --- and just such a
reality as the union home ministry says it
is, and none other; a special law for terrorism
is therefore based on a _reasonable
classification_. That takes care of _Article 14_.
The procedure and substance of the new law
is 'just and fair' as required by the _Maneka
Gandhi judgment_, for no reason other than
that a parliament _competent_ to enact the
_special legislation_ for the _special circumstances_
has enacted it, and once the
"reasonableness" of the classification of the
_special situation_ is accepted, you cannot
complain that the _special procedure_ denies
rights that you had under _ordinary procedure_.
(That the _special procedure_ can be questioned
not for being _special_ but for being arbitrary
and unreasonable is a distinction emphasised
by the _Maneka Gandhi judgment_, which
Justice Pandian does not recognise.) And as
nobody who argued the case has contended
that _TADA_ violates _Article 19_ or any other
fundamental right, there is nothing left to be
vindicated. This about sums up the
Constitution Bench judgment on _TADA_.

Two judges out of the five have dissented,
and have crafted evidently better argued
--- though excessively cautious --- judgments. If
the composition of the Bench had been
slightly different then it is possible that at
least some of the more obnoxious provisions
of _TADA_, such as the admissibility of
confessions made to policemen of rank SP
or above (_sec 15_), the conferment of certain
judicial powers on _executive magistrates_
(_secs 20(3) and 20(4)_), and the oppressive
prerequisites for the granting of _bail_
(_sec 20(8)_), would have been struck down
by the majority. Nevertheless, _TADA_ is now
a fact of life for the people of this country,
for as long as the government of India wishes
to extend its life, which could well be
indefinitely. I say 'people of this country'
rather than 'terrorists of this country'
advisedly, not only because _TADA_ is
being extensively misused, but also because
even if it is properly used, the 'terrorists'
who are its victims are not some specially
vicious subspecies of Indians, but the very
citizens that justice has to specially
protect: the people peripheral to the
mainstream of --- social, political, ethnic and
economic life of this country --- no matter that
they may be misguided, misled or wilfully
mischievous.

A court that does not possess a social
understanding of the ugly thing called
_terrorism_ cannot possibly look critically at
the provisions of _TADA_. A court that
understands terrorism the same way as the
union home ministry (as Justice Pandian and
his brotherhood unabashedly do) cannot look
at _TADA_ in the spirit of the best values
expressed by the Indian _Supreme Court_ in
the past. A court that does not begin to make
sense of the striking fact that the terrorists
and extremists of India --- Sikhs in Punjab,
Muslims in Kashmir, Tribal people in the
north-east, the wretched of rural Bharat in
Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, expatriate Jaffna
Tamils in Tamil Nadu, and in recent days
disillusioned Muslim youth in various urban
centres --- are all from the political, social,
ethnic and economic periphery of Indian
society, cannot begin to see what it means
if suspects in 'terrorist' crimes are denied
rights that mainstream criminals possess.
Democracy in the best sense hat always
meant justice for the dissident, the abnormal,
the peripheral, notwithstanding that their
proclivities may be held morally unjustifiable
and politically unsupportable by the
mainstream, or even a majority of the
periphery too. Only a court that values such
a justice can look properly at _TADA_. A court
that thinks _justice_ is another name for the
securing of _public order_ cannot.

Heinous crimes have no doubt been
committed by the armed groups espousing
these causes, especially but not only in Punjab.
Bus passengers  and train commuters have
been killed, passers-by have been massacred
in the streets in random firing, and in every
part of the country armed groups have killed
'peoples enemies' and 'police informers'
without any procedural justice or substantive
norms. Whatever the pros and cons of the
need to resort to armed struggle in certain
situations, the armed groups operating in
India certainly need to learn basic lessons
in fairness and justice.

# IMAGES OF TERRORISM

But the discussion of terrorism cannot
begin and end there. Nor can it end up with
"foreign conspiracies" to dismember the nation
--- a particularly unconvincing explanation of
the phenomenon that the state propagates
ceaselessly. Justice Pandian's recital of the
"background and circumstances" attending
the enactment of _TADA_ is startling for more
serious reasons than the judge's very
indifferent prose. Terrorism and disruption
are "a world-wide phenomenon and India is
no exception". The country "in the recent
past has fallen in the firm grip of spiralling
terrorists violence and is caught between the
deadly pangs of disruptive activities". Having
begun in Punjab, "at present they have
outstretched their activities by spreading
their wings far and wide almost bringing the
major part of the country under the extreme
violence and terrorism by letting loose
unprecedented and unprovoked repression
and disruption unmindful of the _security of
the nation_, personal liberty and rights
inclusive of the right to live with human
dignity of innocent citizens of this country
and destroying the image of many glitzy
cities like Chandigarh, Srinagar, Delhi and
Bombay by strangulating the normal life of
the citizens ... there were countless serious
and horrendous events engulfing many cities
with bloodbath, firing, looting, mad-killing
even without sparing women and children
and reducing those area into a graveyard
which brutal atrocities have rocked and
shocked the nation". These "stark facts and
naked truths" cannot be denied by adopting
an "ostrich-like attitude completely ignoring
the impending danger". This is the _Supreme
Court_ speaking, not K P S Gill.

it was in these circumstances, the judge
says, that parliament "has been compelled
to bring forth" special anti-terrorist laws to
"sternly deal with many groups lurking
beneath the murky surface aiding, abetting,
nourishing and fomenting the terrorists". The
rhetoric is truly torrential, and would do the
home ministry proud. The "totality of the
speeches made by the ministers and members
of parliament during the debate in parliament,
the _Statement of Objects and Reasons_, and
the submissions made by the learned
Additional Solicitor General of India" (it is
a quaint fact that the Additional Solicitor
General is always referred to as 'learned' in
the judgment, but the opposing counsel are
frequently plain 'Mr', devoid of the traditional
epithet) are accepted uncritically by Justice
Pandian and his judicial brothers as "facts
of common knowledge and authenticated
report" which the courts can take into
consideration "to sustain the presumption of
constitutionality of a legislative measure",
though in fact you soon discover that they
do not just sustain the presumption but fully
establish the constitutionality of _TADA_ in
Justice Pandian's eyes. He says that the "Court
can take into consideration matters of
common knowledge, matters of common
report, the history of the times" and also can
(if you can make sense of this) "assume
every state of facts which can be conceived
existing at the time of the legislation" as
(quotes he approvingly) the _High Court_ of
Punjab and Haryana said in a full Bench
judgment in 1987. One does not have to be
a post-structuralist to find this celebration of
"matters of common knowledge", "history
of the times" and "existing facts" alarming.
Granting the epistemological legitimacy of
the notion of a fact --- its actuality and
knowability --- and granting also that taking
into account facts of common knowledge in
arriving at judicial conclusions is neither a
novel idea nor an unreasonable one, one may
nevertheless object to the notion that 'facts'
about terrorism are what the home ministry
and the Additional Solicitor General (however
learned) say they are.

The 81-page judgment therefore ends on
page 8 where all the "facts" and the "matters
of common knowledge and report" are set
out, down to the last sharpened claw and
spread out wing of terrorism. For these
uncontroverted "facts" constitute a "_special
situation_", and a parliament competent to
legislate specially for well-defined "special
situations" has in its wisdom produced _TADA_,
and that is that. But the edifice of the judgment
has nevertheless to be fully built. That is a
professional requirement, and so the rest of
the judgment needs to be written. The blame
cannot however be wholly put at the door
of Justice Pandian and his judicial brothers.
It appears (I would like to be corrected if
I am wrong) that the lawyers who contested
the _vires_ of the statute did not challenge the
"history of the times" and "the matters of
common knowledge". They seem to have
conceded the terrain of history and sociology
to the Additional Solicitor General!, and
fought their case with arguments about
parliament's lack of legislative competence;
the unreasonableness of the classification of
_terrorist and disruptive offences_; and the
unfairness of the procedure prescribed for
charging and trying these offences. This self-imposed
restriction is partly reflected in the
surprising fact that _TADA_ has been
challenged only for violating Articles 14 and
21, whereas in its very fundamentals it
violates the political freedoms guaranteed in
_Article 19_ Indeed, it violates the very crux
of a democratic Constitution which is
premised on freedom of political choice as
a matter of right, a freedom that is certainly
part of the _basic structure_ of the Indian
Constitution as much as _parliamentary
democracy_ or an _independent judiciary_.

The voluntary imposition of this
restriction --- which should no doubt be put
down to the caution that these difficult times
appear to mandate even to the most
courageous --- does not make the effort
altogether worthless, as witness the dissenting
judgments of Justices Ramaswamy and Salhai.
But Justice Pandian has a few more arguments
up his sleeve. He first defends the legislative
competence of parliament to enact _TADA_
with the contrived argument that it concerns
neither "law and order" nor "public order",
but the _"_Defence of India_"_, which is a subject
within the legislative competence of
parliament. But in that case it is difficult to
see why everybody who commits a crime
to _overawe the government_ or to _alienate any
section of the population_ should be called
a "terrorist", as does _section 3_ of the act, for
such a person may be entirely patriotic and
full of zeal to defend the country's borders
against all external intruders. The court cannot
get away with the argument that what is
relevant for deciding the legislative
competence is the "pith and substance" of
the act and not the whole of it, for _sec 3_ is
very much central to the "pith and substance"
of _TADA_. But in truth, the notion that _TADA_
is concerned with the "_Defence of India_" has
nothing to do with the actual text of the
statute, but is an ideological presentation of
the act, in tune with the general ideological
representation of 'terrorism' as a foreign-inspired
disease. It is sad that the _Supreme
Court_ should voluntarily become part of this
ideological campaign of the Indian State.

Next Justice Pandian defends the
"reasonableness" of the classification of
offences made by _TADA_ on the ground of
the "matters of common report" and the
"history of the times" that have been conceded
by both parties. As we shall see below, once
we question _TADA_ in the light of the freedom
of political choice (implicit in _Article 19_
and in the course of that effort look critically
at the "history of the times" as stated by the
home ministry, the "reasonableness" starts
looking shaky. And finally, Justice Pandian
defends the new procedure laid down by
_TADA_ as "just and fair" on the ground that
it meets the stated aims of the legislature.
He quotes approvingly a 1952 judgment of
the _Supreme Court_ upholding the validity of
an impugned section of the _Bombay Police
Act_: "It is true that a procedure different from
what is laid down under the ordinary law has
been provided for a particular class of
persons ... but the discrimination if any is
based upon a _reasonable classification_ which
is within the competence of the legislature
to make. Having regard to the objective
which the legislation has in view and the
policy underlying it, a departure from the
_ordinary procedure_ can certainly be justified
as the best means of giving effect to the
_object_ of the legislature". He also quotes a
1951 judgment of the _Supreme Court_ which
said that "the presumption is always in favour
of the constitutionality of an enactment since
it must be assumed that the legislature
understands and correctly appreciates the
needs of its own people and its laws are
directed to problems made manifest by
experience and its discriminations are based
on adequate grounds". But granting the
"reasonableness" of the classification of a new
category of offences, and also the need to
depart from _normal procedure_ to that end,
the test of "just and fair" procedure cannot
be answered by the argument that the
procedure is best suited to give effect to the
_object_ of the legislation, and parliament
knows best how to make adequate laws. That
would defeat the whole logic of the _Maneka
Gandhi judgment_. Bhagwati said quite
explicitly in that judgment that the equal
protection of the laws guaranteed by
_Article 14_ cannot be merely reduced to the
requirement that any legal classification of
persons or situations must be based on
_reasonable grounds_. Legal equality, he said,
is a guarantee against arbitrariness. In his
oft-quoted words, "the principle of
reasonableness ... which is an essential
element of equality or non-arbitrariness
pervades _Article 14_ like a brooding omnipresence".
And any procedure by which a
person is deprived of life or personal liberty
must stand the test of this reasonableness or
non-arbitrariness required by _Article 14_

It is true that the _Supreme Court_ has on
occasion reverted to a traditional mode of
interpretation of the right to life and liberty
in _post-Maneka Gandhi_ cases such as _A K
Roy vs Union of India_, 1982. But if (as
Justice Pandian thinks) that logic is sufficient
to answer the requirement of _Article 21_ then
the least the _Supreme Court_ could do is to
stop quoting the _Maneka Gandhi judgment_
and overrule it once for all, for that at least
would make it clear to the people where their
rights stand in the eyes of the highest court
of the land. That logic, however, goes entirely
against the _ratio_[^ratio] of not only the _Maneka
Gandhi judgment_ but also that of a number
of judgments given by the same court in the
80s concerning many matters, such as for
instance _prisoners' rights_. That a prisoner
cannot enjoy the same rights as a free person,
and that a sensibly distinguished high-security
prisoner cannot enjoy the same rights as an
ordinary prisoner are reasonable propositions,
but yet the court refused to accept that
therefore any procedure lawfully enacted to
confine prisoners securely is a "just and fair"
procedure merely because whichever
legislative or administrative body has in its
competence made the rules knows how best
to achieve the purpose for which the rules
are intended.

[^ratio]: _ratio decidendi_ is latin for the reason for the decision of any judgement.

Suppose for the moment that _terrorist and
disruptive activities_ constitute a sensibly
distinguished class of offences. Does it
necessarily follow that there can be nothing
arbitrary, oppressive and fanciful about
prescribing a maximum of one year as against
the normal 90 days as the period up to which
the prisoner's remand can be continuously
extended by the _Designated Court_? Why one
year? What is it in the definition of _TADA_
offences that makes it reasonable to multiply
the required period of investigation by a
factor of four? The _Supreme Court_ may not
permit itself to weigh each and every
difference in procedure, however minute, to
see whether the deviation is justified. But
certainly the court is entitled to take note of
departures from _normal procedure_ that are
beyond reasonable explanation, that are
fanciful or exaggerated? Or the institution
of a new procedure that violates _natural
justice_, and is unjust or unfair? This much
is surely implied in the _dictum_[^dictum] of the _Maneka
Gandhi judgment_, supposedly accepted ever
since by the _Supreme Court_, that the law
referred to in _Article 21_ must be a _reasonable
law_, and not "any enacted piece", in VR
Krishna Iyer's words: "It can certainly be
argued that reasonableness entails not merely
reasonableness of the categorisation of the
new class of offences, but also reasonableness
in the deviation of the new procedure from
the procedure applicable to the normal
offenders, and also inherent reasonableness
and fairness of the new procedure". It would
have been good if the _Supreme Court_ had
considered this view explicitly and decided
against it, instead of rejecting it implicitly.

[^dictum]: _obiter dictum_ which means a remark by the way, or an aside. A remark, statement, or observation of a judge that is not a necessary part of the legal reasoning needed to reach the decision in a case. Although dictum may be cited in a legal argument, it is not binding as legal precedent, meaning that other courts are not required to accept it.

What, similarly, is the rationale for allowing
certain hitherto unknown judicial functions
to _executive magistrates_? It cannot be in the
interest of speed as claimed by the
government, for (and this is truly a matter
of common knowledge and report) in all
states of India, every seat of a _judicial magistrate_
is also the seat of an _executive
magistrate_ and vice versa. The one is not
unavailable where the other is available. So
there is no convenience of speed in allowing
_executive magistrates_ to do judicial jobs. On
the other hand, the innovation can be
suspected to hide the _mala fide_ intention of
in fact bypassing judicial scrutiny, for
_executive magistrates_ are notoriously (and
this too is a "matter of common knowledge")
much more amenable to executive
interference than _judicial magistrates_, and
indeed increasingly there are many instances
where police officers themselves possess
powers of an _executive magistrate_. _Special
executive magistrates_ too can be appointed
at will by the government without judicial
consultation. Does not the procedural
"innovation" then suffer from harmful and
oppressive possibilities?

Justice Pandian's answer is that the
separation of the _judiciary_ and _executive_ is
not absolute in the Indian state, though _Article
50_ of the Constitution (a _Directive Principle
of State Policy_) says that the state should
endeavour to separate the two. He quotes
various provisions of the _CrPC_[^crpc] under which
_executive magistrates_ have been performing
judicial functions. But what does this mean?
It only means that the Indian government has
made no serious effort to give effect to _Article 50_.
That being only a _directive principle_, the
courts cannot force the government to
implementit, but surely the courts can prevent
the government from moving farther away
from the _directive principles_? If it is not
mandatory to legislate the _directive principles_,
is it not nevertheless impermissible to
legislate contrary to them? Especially when
procedural fairness and justice in criminal
investigation and trial which impinge upon
the fundamental right to life and personal
liberty are involved?

[^crpc]: Criminal Procedure Code is a legislation that describes the procedure for administration of substantive criminal law (such Indian Penal Code/IPC) in India.

# _BAIL_ PROVISIONS

The argument in defence of the _bail
provisions_ of _TADA_ is the most shoddy part
of the _Kartar Singh_ judgment. The notion
that a person accused of a crime is to be
treated as innocent until the guilt is proved
is built into the _Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)_.
While a magistrate's power to release a
prisoner on _bail_ is curtailed in cases where
the punishment is death or life imprisonment,
there is no such curtailment of the authority
of the _sessions court_ or _high court_, to which
the accused can always have recourse if the
lower court rejects the _bail application_. Under
_TADA_, the _designated court_ is to release the
accused on _bail_ only if there is reasonable
ground to believe that _he is not guilty_, and
also that _he will not again commit a similar
crime if released on bail_. And there is no
higher court which has unfettered power to
release the accused on _bail_. What Justice
Pandian does is to justify the restriction placed
upon the _bail-granting power_ of the
_designated court_ by saying that it is similar
to the restriction placed by the _CrPC_ in
normal cases upon the _bail-granting power_
of the courts lower than the _sessions court_,
ignoring the crucial fact that such a restriction
is compensated by the unfettered power of
higher courts under the _CrPC_, whereas under
_TADA_ there is no higher court whose power
to grant _bail_ is unrestricted. This is plain
enough from the statute, and was made
explicit-six years ago by the _Supreme Court_
in _Usmanbhai Dawoodbhai Mernon vs State
of Gujarat_, 1988, with which opinion Justice
Pandian says "we are in full agreement".

The judge further says that the provision
in _CrPC_ which says that while granting _bail_,
the _sessions court_ or _high court_ may impose
conditions on the prisoner with a view to
ensure that he or she will not commit a
similar offence, is a provision of the same
nature as the restriction in _TADA_ that _bail_
should not be given unless there is reasonable
certainty that the accused will not commit
a similar offence again. The judge must be
charged with extremely loose thinking. The
provision in _CrPC_ is a restriction imposed
upon the liberty of the accused (such as that
the accused shall not visit the place of
occurrence of the offence without the court's
permission) after the prisoner's liberty from
prison has been granted, whereas the
provision in _TADA_ is a pre-condition for the
granting of liberty. There is a whole world's
difference between the two, which the
Additional Solicitor General has described
and the _Supreme Court_ has accepted as being
similar in nature. Way back in 1988, in _Bimal
Kaur vs Union of India_, the _Punjab and
Haryana High Court_ had described as
obnoxious the condition that _bail should not
be granted without reasonable certainty that
the prisoner will not repeat a similar offence_,
and had declared that bit of _TADA_ _ultra
vires_. The _Supreme Court_ has now restored
it to constitutional status with this entirely
specious analogy.

But apart from the speciousness of the
_Supreme Court_'s logic there is another reason
for regarding the _bail provisions_ of _TADA_
_unconstitutional_. To say that a person who
is not yet convicted of an offence should be
denied _bail_ on the ground that he or she may
commit a similar offence if released amounts
to putting that person in _preventive detention_.
The _bail provisions_ of _TADA_ therefore
effectively make it a _preventive detention
law_ as well as a _penal_ and _procedural law_.
But under the Constitution a _preventive
detention_ law must necessarily follow the
procedure mandated in _Article 22_ which
TADA does not follow. There is no provision
for an _Advisory Board_ and a review by it
of the detention in _TADA_. The _bail provision_
of _TADA_ thus is a violation of _Article 22_

This is not just a technical argument. It
goes to the heart of the oppressive character
of _TADA_ in one aspect. The police have
been using _TADA_ essentially as a _preventive
detention_ law, which is not what it is supposed
to be, and which it cannot be, in view of
_Article 22_. It is a common complaint of the
Indian police that courts are too lenient in
granting _bail_ (which is not uniformly true)
and therefore there is no adequate _deterrence_
to crime (it is this deterrence rather than
investigative convenience that they habitually
link their complaints about _bail_ with). 'We
catch hold of hardcore criminals with great
difficulty, and the Courts release them on
_bail_ in much less time than it takes us to catch
them', is a frequently heard grouse. They
would like to see that suspects, once
apprehended by them, stay in jail _until the
case is decided_, which eventuality can be
postponed indefinitely, by filing multiple
cases against each such suspect, implicating
large numbers of (preferably inaccessible
and underground) "associates" in each case,
and thereby dragging the trial (or rather, the
complex of trials) endlessly. The police are
perfectly adept at keeping people in endless
_preventive detention_ under purportedly
punitive laws provided only _bail_ is difficult
to get. If the _Supreme Court_ does not know
this, it knows nothing of the task of the
_judiciary_ in India. It is not enough to know
the "facts of common knowledge and report"
about the terrorists. There are such equally
authenticated facts about the police, which
too the courts should be aware of and take
into consideration while judging the _vires_ of
penal procedures.

Now that the police have a law after their
hearts in _TADA_ they are happily putting
people behind bars to stay there for long
periods without any offence being proved.
And given the political nature of _TADA_
offences (_TADA_ is essentially a criminal
law for the newly-defined category of _political
offences_, a fact that should have been, but
unfortunately has not been, the starting point
for the arguments of the lawyers challenging
the act), the political establishment too is
more interested in shutting up the suspects
and putting society out of their harm's reach,
rather than trying them and punishing them
for each individual crime. If one were not
burdened by a philosophical suspicion of
post-structuralist excesses, one would
describe the whole structure of _TADA_ and
its designated courts as an elaborate political
game coded in penal and judicial language.
But that way of looking at it is of little help
in salvaging the valuable principles of _natural
justice_ and _substantive and procedural
fairness_ that are not part of any cognitive
code, but are real legacies of past struggles
for democracy, equality and justice.

# CONFESSIONS AS EVIDENCE

As far as procedure goes, the most
obnoxious provision of _TADA_ is _sec 15(1)_
which says that confessions made by an
accused to a police officer of rank SP or
above are admissible in evidence in the
_designated court_. Justice Pandian's reasoning
for regarding this provision as not violative
of _Articles 20(3)_ and _21_ is typical of his
entire mode of reasoning. He confesses that
he too was at first tempted to "share the view
of the learned counsel that it would be
dangerous to make a statement given to a
police officer admissible", but he has
overcome the temptation in view of the "legal
competence of the legislature to make a law
prescribing a _different mode of proof_, the
meaningful _purpose and object of the
legislation_, the _gravity of terrorism unleashed_
by the terrorists and the disruptionists
endangering not only the sovereignty and
integrity of the country but also the normal
life of the citizens, and the reluctance of even
the victims as well as the public in coming
forward, at the risk of their lives, to give
evidence", and therefore holds the relevant
section of _TADA_ perfectly constitutional. In
other words there is a _special situation_
prevalent in the country whose nature is
undisputed and a matter of common
knowledge, and a parliament competent to
make the required law has made such a law
to serve the required purpose, which is a
meaningful purpose, and that is all there is
to its constitutionality. It is a matter of minor
redemption that both Justice Sahai and Justice
Ramaswamy, in their dissenting judgments,
have held this provision _unconstitutional_,
and in doing so have made an elaborate
discussion of the problem of _police torture_,
which should in truth be central to any
consideration of statutory provisions such as
_sec 15(1)_ of _TADA_. The view of the majority
however is an expression of a barely
concealed cynicism; 'because these terrorists
will not allow witnesses to depose against
them, the only way out is to beat them up
and extract confessions and treat that as
evidence'. Such a cynicism is unworthy of
the highest judicial body of the land. As for
armed groups not allowing anyone to depose
against them, this is a general problem faced
by criminal courts whenever powerful
persons are involved, except that nobody
sees it as a problem when the source of the
power is a _dominant position_ in society. It
is only when the power stems from a rebel's
gun that it is seen as a problem. But when
society has reached a stage where social and
political rebels of whichever variety take so
easily to guns --- a stage that Indian society
has certainly reached --- the problem of
effective conduct of criminal trials cannot
be divorced from basic problems of justice
in the socio-economic order, and cannot be
solved by a facile recourse to an implicit
sanction of _police torture_.

At the other end of the spectrum is this
seemingly miserable little right for the
accused defended by some of the lawyers
challenging _TADA_: that when a case is
transferred from one _designated court_ to
another, whether within the same state or
outside, the objections if any of the accused
must be mandatorily taken into account before
the transfer is effected. It seems a harmless
enough right to ask for, but the _Supreme
Court_ is not moved. _Section 11(2)_ of _TADA_
as it stands says that the transfer is to be
effected with the concurrence of the Chief
Justice of India, and Justice Pandian leaves
it to the Chief Justice to decide from case
to case whether he wants to hear the accused.
It is interesting to hear the weighty arguments
employed by the Additional Solicitor General
and silently allowed to pass by the court to
obstruct the simple plea. The Additional
Solicitor General says that under certain
circumstances "the parliament is fully
empowered to exclude the invocation of the
rule of _natural justice_ ... having regard to the
fact that the entertainment of any objection
would only _frustrate_ the proceedings and
_paralyse_ the meaningful purpose of the
provision". This weighty argument (whatever
its intrinsic worth) is evidently uncalled for
in this simple situation where all that is being
asked for is that when the Attorney General
applies to the Chief Justice of India for
permission to transfer a case, the accused
concerned should also have a right to express
their views, which views should be taken
into account by the Chief Justice in arriving
at a decision. Nothing need be 'paralysed'
by this. But Justice Pandian does not confront
the proposition that rules of _natural justice_
can be set aside so cavalierly as this. Instead,
he argues that the very fact that the
concurrence for the transfer is to be given
by none other than the highest judicial officer
in the land who gives his opinion by "drawing
the requisite _subjective satisfaction_ on the
reasons given in the application or any
material placed before him explaining the
exigencies of the situation" is sufficient to
prove the _bona fides_ of the lawmakers and
to protect the rights of the accused. But what
would be lost if the materials from which
the Chief Justice is to draw _subjective
satisfaction_ include whatever reasoned
objections the accused may have? As for the
power to set aside _natural justice_, Justice
Pandian says nothing about its applicability
to this --- or any --- situation, but adds
magnanimously that notwithstanding such a
power that parliament may have, the Chief
Justice may, from case to case, allow the
accused to express objections, a discretion
that is in any case not excluded by the act
itself. Such a miserly attitude towards civil
liberties is unusual, to say the least. It has
been customary for Indian courts that
whenever they deny major rights or
substantial relief, they add the spiritual balm
of subsidiary minor relief, but the majority
in _Kartar Singh vs State of Punjab_ is
implacable in its resolve not to allow the
"sharpened claws and outstretched wings of
the terrorists" any quarter whatsoever. It is
a pity that Justice Pandian and his brothers
have never seen, and do not possess the
imagination to visualise, who these terrorists
are whom they have so ruthlessly put outside
the protection of the Indian Constitution.

In arguing the case for the constitutionality
of _TADA_, the state has frequently resorted
to --- and the court has at more than one point
approved --- a mode of argument that proves
one apprehension that has often been raised
and discussed in the _civil liberties movement_.
There are many special statutes dealing with
socially oppressive and morally obnoxious
offences. These are statutes dealing with
smugglers, bootleggers, with crimes against
women, crimes against scheduled castes and
tribes, and crimes against public morality.
Most such statutes include provisions that
contravene some principle or other of _natural
justice_. And the courts as well as democratic
public opinion has allowed them to pass
keeping In view the exceptional nature of
such crimes. The apprehension of the civil
rights movement has been that once an
_undesirable principle_ is laid down in the
name of a _desirable object_, there is no stopping
its extension to more ambiguous or plainly
undesirable ends, especially since the
discretion lies with the increasingly
lumpenised legislatures and insensitive
bureaucracies. The _TADA_ case has proved
the apprehensions true, and with a vengeance.
_TADA_ cripples the right of the accused to
cross-examine witnesses by allowing the
_Designated Court_ to keep the identity of the
witnesses secret, if it so wishes. This is
certainly a violation of _natural justice_. But
the _Supreme Court_ in a 1973 case had said
that rules of _natural justice_ cannot remain
the same in all conditions, and had justified
the examination of witnesses outside the
presence of the accused, and the denial of
the right of cross-examination to the accused.
But what was that case? It was a case where
some men had entered and misbehaved in
a women's hostel and in the ensuing enquiry
the institution's authorities had understandably
decided not to allow the accused
to be present when the women inmates were
examined by the enquiry committee. The
_Supreme Court_, with perfect good sense, had
justified the procedure, and in the process
laid down the principle that has now come
in use to Justice Pandian to uphold the _vires_
of the provision of _TADA_ that takes the
accused blindfolded through the trial.

Similarly, _in camera_ trial as provided for
in _sec 16(1)_ of _TADA_ is justified by Justice
Pandian with the argument that such a
provision is already there in the _CrPC_ in the
case of the offence of _rape_. About anticipatory
_bail_ too, the judge could have said that the
_SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act_
also excludes the right of anticipatory _bail_
to upper caste persons accused of crimes
against scheduled castes or tribes. But Justice
Pandian finds an easier substitute in a strange
argument: _anticipatory bail_ is a new right
introduced into the _CrPC_ only in 1973, and
therefore removing this right cannot be called
a violation of personal liberty. He also relies,
it is true, on an argument proffered by the
_Punjab and Haryana High Court_ in _Bimal
Kaur vs Stale of Punjab_, that "persons accused
of terrorist offences are members of a well-organised
secret movement whom the
enforcing agencies find it difficult to lay
their hands on", and therefore it is all right
to exclude the right of _anticipatory bail_ for
_TADA_ offences. But this is an arbitrary
reading of "facts of common report and
knowledge" into the statute, whereas _TADA_
itself says nowhere that to be guilty of a
_terrorist offence_, one has to be a member of
a "well organised secret movement". The
assumption that all _TADA_ _detenus_ are such
persons is one of the common images of
terrorism that haunt judicial minds and mask
the fact that the definition of a _terrorist offence_
in the statute does not conform to what is
imagined, and further also the fact that the
majority of _TADA_ _detenus_ are not members
of any secret movement at all --- whether well
or ill organised. After all, while granting
_anticipatory bail_, the court is supposed to
principally consider whether the applicant
needs to go through the rigmarole of arrest
and remand, or can be allowed at liberty
without affecting the interests of justice while
the investigation is going on. This discretion
is essential to the provision of _anticipatory
bail_, and is by its very nature a consideration
that is applied from case to case. There is
no logic in assuming beforehand that all
persons accused of _TADA_ offences are
necessarily going to be underground
activists --- or slippery gangsters --- whereas
no such explicit presumption is present in
the statute as a prerequisite for an offence
to be a _TADA_ offence.

Aside of that, the generalisation of
principles of procedure that are violative of
_natural justice_, from offences that are antisocial
and immoral in character to a statute
such as TADA that is pre-eminently aimed
at dissenting politics, is an eventuality --- as
said above --- apprehended by the _civil
liberties movement_, and yet an eventuality
that is difficult to avoid or evade and can
only be lived with. It is evidently a consequence
of the nature of law as an institution
of the _bourgeois state_: its notion of fairness
and equitability can only be formal and
notional, and therefore insensitive to social
hierarchies and unequal social and economic
relations. To say this is not to pretend that
there is an easy solution to the problem here
posed: to conceptualise and institutionalise
law in such a way that it will possess the
_bourgeois virtue_ of avoiding arbitrariness
and unreasonable selectivity, and will at the
same time be supple and flexible enough to
be sensitive to the iniquities in social and
economic relations; in other words to create
a legal system that will be attuned to the
requirements of social change but at the
same time somehow be free from the
possibility of unfair discrimination and
partisan misuse. The post-revolutionary
societies ruled by communist parties
uniformly failed to solve this problem, and
instead created monstrous legal systems in
which the problem is by-passed and the law
is made a handmaid of the party in power.
Leave alone law and legal systems, any
substantive --- as distinct from formal or
procedural --- perfection in the arrangement
of human affairs will perhaps long be an
elusive ideal (whatever the Utopian dreams
of Marx) because the perfectibility of the
human subject has inherent limitations. As
a value and as a vision, one should of course
go on dreaming with Marx in his more
extreme moods that not only law, but
philosophy, morality and alt such objectified
norms of human conduct will be abolished
because they will coalesce with life and
become part of the lived reality of human
life, for it is such visions that make possible
whatever degree of perfection is given to us.

# ANTI-DEMOCRATIC ESSENCE

We finally come to what is undoubtedly
the anti-democratic essence of _TADA_: the
fact that its classification of the new category
of terrorist and disruptive offences includes
_politics_ as a defining element. In discussing
this, we will perforce have to go beyond even
the best of the _Supreme Court_'s past
pronouncements, for unlike the matter of
procedural and punitive justice, in which the
_Supreme Court_ has made substantial
contributions towards the protection of
people's rights in the last two decades, it has
behaved uniformly, conservatively and
cautiously in the matter of freedom of political
choice and political liberty as fundamental
rights stemming from _Article 19_. The _TADA_
case was a good occasion for charting out
a new path in this matter, but neither the
lawyers who challenged the statute nor the
judges who sat in judgment over its _vires_ saw
it that way. _TADA_ was challenged only for
its procedural unfairness and was upheld
--- however dubiously --- as procedurally fair. It
was not challenged for being violative of the
right to _political freedom_ which is the essence
of the political democracy that India proudly
proclaims itself to be, and of course the
_Supreme Court_'s frame of mind leaves little
doubt that if it had been, the challenge would
have been received very in hospitably by the
Bench.

But that need not deter a rational
examination of the statute. When political
activists take to violence in a systematic
manner, the dividing line between politics
and crime becomes quite thin, but that only
means that a democratic legal and judicial
system must be extra careful to ensure that
it does not transgress its limits and encroach
upon political liberty in the name of punishing
and preventing crime. _TADA_, on the contrary,
leaves no dividing line at all between politics
and crime. A crime of violence committed
with political intent is what a _terrorist offence_
is, by definition, and to be an offence of
disruption, no crime of violence is at all
necessary. Mere political intent is a crime.
Can that be a reasonable basis for classification
of offences ? _Article 19_ allows
reasonable restrictions to be placed upon
civil and political freedoms, but would it not
be anathema to its spirit to classify crimes
as political and non-political and to devise
a new and oppressive procedure for the
former? It is now supposedly accepted that
fundamental rights cannot be seen in isolation
of each other, but must be seen together. A
classification under _Article 14_ cannot
therefore be repugnant to the right of political
liberty, the freedom of political choice, that
is implied by _Article 19(1)(a)_, _(b)_ and _(c)_.
If it is, it would not be a reasonable classification.

Yet, this is what _TADA_ does. _Section 3_
of _TADA_ defines a terrorist act as an offence
of violence against person or property
committed with a certain category of
weapons, provided it is committed "with the
intent to overawe the government as by law
established, or to strike terror in the hearts
of the people, or any section of the people,
or to alienate any section of the people, or
to adversely affect the harmony amongst
different sections of the people". To _overawe_
the government is certainly a political aim,
and so is the aim of terrorising a certain
section of the people or adversely affecting
the harmony amongst different sections of
the people, or alienating a section of the
people. 'A section of the people', as used
here, can only mean a social group, such as
a class, caste, ethnic, linguistic or religious
community. To strike terror in such a group
or to alienate such a group may well be an
obnoxious act, but it is a political act
nevertheless. Even if, in principle, there can
be non-political crimes that fall within the
description of _section 3_ of _TADA_, the police
have correctly understood the unstated major
premise of _TADA_ and are using it only
against political activists. _Subsection 5_ of
_section 3_ makes things even more explicit.
It says that it is a crime to be a member of
a _terrorist gang_ or a terrorist organisation,
that is, a gang or organisation that indulges
in terrorist actions. Taking this together with
the meaning given to 'terrorist act' in the
preceding subsection, what this provision
says is that if you are a member of (i) a
revolutionary communist organisation that
believes in the forcible overthrow of the
existing political order; or (ii)an organisation
of _dalits_, muslims, christians, etc, that
employs force to resist upper caste/Hindu
domination; or (iii) an organisation of a
linguistic orethnic such as Nagas, Kashmiris
or Tamils that employs force to resist or
overthrow alien hegemony; then even if the
organisation of which you are a member is
not legally banned, you are guilty of a crime
punishable by a minimum of five years'
imprisonment and maximum of a life
sentence

The political nature of _TADA_ --- the fact
that politics is a central element of the
classification of crimes effected by this
statute --- is fully evident here. For, to be a
member of a _dacoit gang_ has always been
a crime under the Indian Penal Code. What
distinguishes a _terrorist gang_ from a _dacoit
gang_ is not any qualitative difference in the
nature of the offences committed (in both
cases, the offence is a crime of armed violence
against person and property, the difference
being only in minor details), but the difference
in the _intention_. The _intention_ of the _terrorist
gang_ is political, whereas the _intention_ of the
_dacoit gang_ is only pecuniary. And it is this
political nature of the _intention_ that forms
the basis of the classification of a _terrorist
gang_ as a category different from a _dacoit
gang_, with membership of the gang entailing
a much heavier punishment and a much more
illiberal procedure of investigation and trial.
Can this be called a reasonable classification
in a country whose Constitution guarantees
the freedom of political choice implicitly as
a fundamental right?

More generally, if you commit a crime of
murder, arson, assault or abduction with lethal
weapons, with a pecuniary or retaliatory or
any such apolitical motive, then your crime
falls in one category. If you commit the same
crime of murder, arson, assault or abduction
with the same weapons with a view to
ultimately overthrow the capitalist state, or
with a view to put an end to the oppression
of _dalits_ by the upper castes, or to protect
the security and rights of Muslims or
Christians, or with a view to enable the
Mizos or Punjabis to separate themselves
from the country, then the same crime (committed
with the weapons) is in a different
category. You are now liable for a heavier
punishment and are tried by a distinctly
more illiberal procedure. Is this classification
of identical offences into separate categories
according to the politics underlying
the act, a _reasonable classification_ in a
political democracy, in a country whose
Constitution guarantees freedom of political
choice as a fundamental right, as the Indian
Constitution implicitly does in _Article 19(1)(a)_, _(b)_ and _(c)_?

It is obviously not, and this is where _TADA_
begins to be _undemocratic_ and _unconstitutional_.
Its procedural unfairness comes later.
Since those who challenged the _vires_ of the
act did not approach the matter from this
angle, the _Supreme Court_'s answer to this
mode of argument cannot be found in so
many words in the _Kartar Singh_ judgment.
But it can easily be inferred from the outlook
that informs the judgment. Like a magic
puzzle that is simultaneously this as well as
that, _TADA_ keeps getting transmuted every
second from its literal text to the images
conveyed by the word 'terrorism'. Terrorism
conveys images of blown up DTC buses, bits
of flesh strewn in a bombed market place,
Bihari workers mowed down in a Punjabi
village, a khakhi-clad leg stuck high up a tree
in the landmined Telengana countryside, a
blood-splattered refugee camp in Mizoram,
etc. The text of _TADA_ contains none of this
but is a straightforward piece of illiberal
legislation targeted at militant political dissent
(or even mere dissenting political opinion,
in the case of ethnic groups or linguistic
communities desiring freedom from India).
But the legitimacy of the illiberal statute
rests upon the images of blood and gore. That
lay persons are easily carried away by this
imagery is perhaps understandable but it is
neither understandable nor pardonable that
judges of the highest court of the land are
unable to see that 'the "blood-bath, firing,
looting, mad killing" that Justice Pandian is
so eloquent about has nothing to do with
the actual classification of offences effected
by _TADA_, whose _vires_ the _Supreme Court_
is called upon to adjudicate. Justice Pandian
imputes to _TADA_ the aim of tackling "a
grave emergency situation created either by
external forces particularly at the frontiers
of the country or by _anti-nationals_ throwing
a challenge to the very existence and
sovereignty of the country in its democratic
polity". The provisions of the act cast a much
wider net than is implied by this imputed
aim, which can itself be criticised both for
being gratuitous and tendentious.

If terrorism had been defined as, let us say,
mass and random killing as distinct from
an ordinary murder in which a targeted X
or Y is killed; or as setting off explosives
or opening gun-fire in a public place; or
derailing a passenger train wantonly; then
at least the definition would be in accordance
with the image of 'blood-bath and mad
killing' used to justify the classification,
even if one would still object to the unfair
trial procedure. But what we have, on the
contrary, is first of all rhetoric that brings
to mind the sickening picture of bits of
human flesh strewn in a Delhi market place,
and then a definition of terrorism which says
that if you kill X because you think he is
an obstacle to your business then you are a
one category of criminal and are entitled
to a civilised procedure of trial and norm of
punishment, but if you kill the same X
because you think he is an obstacle to the
communist revolution, or to make an example
of him to the _brahmins_, the _rajputs_, the
_marwaris_, the _bengalis_ or whoever you think
needs to be given a scare to help liberate your
caste/community/nationality, then you are a
criminal of a different category, and you are
entitled to only arather uncivilised procedure
of trial and norm of punishment. There can
be nothing more scandalous than the inability
of the highest judiciary of the land
to see through this fraud of language and
images played upon citizens and courts by
_TADA_.

But as we go ahead from _section 3_ of
_TADA_, which at least requires some
explanation to enable one to see through its
fraudulent nature, the _intention_ of the
legislature becomes even more plain in the
subsequent sections. _Section 4_, for instance,
says that if you merely propagate the opinion
or even just encourage the opinion that, say,
the Tamils or the Kashmiris are a people
apart and should live apart from India, then
you have committed the crime of "disruption",
for which the minimum punishment is five
years and the maximum a life sentence. No
blood-bath, no mad killing, but mere holding
or propagation of an opinion. It is also a
crime of disruption to advocate, advise,
suggest, incite or to predict, prophesise or
pronounce (by act, speech or any medium)
in such a way as to advocate, advise, suggest
or incite the killing or destruction of any
person bound under the Constitution to
uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India;
or any public servant whatsoever --- and for
the mere act of verbal, literal or pictorial
expression you are liable for a minimum of
five years and a maximum of life
imprisonment. It is interesting that in this
provision, "a person bound under the
Constitution to uphold the sovereignty and
integrity of India" is treated on par with "any
public servant', for Justice Pandian makes
an elaborate discussion of the distinction
between _law and order_, _public order_ and the
_Defence of India_, and justifies parliaments
legislative competence to enact a statute
such as _TADA_ on the ground that it is
concerned neither with mere _law and order_
nor _public order_, but nothing less than the
_Defence of India_. Evidently, the act itself
cares nothing for such niceties of distinction,
for not every public servant is concerned
with the _sovereignty and integrity
of India_, and yet the act treats all of them
on par.

But that apart, what this provision means
is that whether a retrenched industrial
worker aggrieved by the freedom to "rationalise"
industrial workforce conceded by
P V Narasimha Rao's "structural-adjusting"
government wishes instant death to that old
man, or the progeny of a poor labourer killed
in police custody wail that a similar death
may visit the policemen concerned, the mere
expression of such a wish (with which many
right-thinking people would sympathise) may
result in penal charges under _TADA_ entailing
the uniform punishment for all _TADA_
offences: five years to life imprisonment.
The _Defence of India_, evidently, is a very
demanding cause, but quite thoroughly out
of tunc with what is best about the Constitution
of India. But Justice Pandian and
his brother judges think otherwise. One
should be pardoned for expecting the judges
of the highest court of the land to understand
that the _Defence of India_ includes the _Defence
of the Constitution of India_; and that the
_Defence of India_ is the _Defence of India_ as
a democracy. But unfortunately they have
set these concepts one against the other and
have ended up looking at the _Defence of
India_ the way a KPS Gill would. _Natural
justice_ and _political freedom_ are therefore
not part of the values and institutions that
make up this India that is to be defended
jealously. They are a luxury or perhaps a
vanity of democracy that are to be ruthlessly
superseded when the "Defence" of an India
defined exclusively in terms of territory,
security and order is endangered.
