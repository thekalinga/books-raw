_This is not a futuristic scenario, not an essay on how 'the _TADA_
can be misused'. This is an account of what is already largely
happening over an increasingly large area of the country, and
with respect to an increasingly large category of political activists,
activists of the oppressed nationalities and minority communities,
activists of revolutionary groups, activists of militant trade unions
and tribal activists._

\ 

It is no longer a very daring thing to talk
about the _fascisation_ of the Indian State;
almost everybody who has learnt to spell
that word does so, including a number of
people whose credentials in this regard are
so suspect --- the reference is not merely to
AK Sen and VP Singh --- that it is a surprise
that they are bold enough to risk a
democratic posture in public. However, if
one filters out the violence from their
language, there is little that can be called
analysis of the structure and instruments
of the _fascisation_. Usually it just boils
down to the single-point rhetoric that we
have been listening to since the days of the
Congress split: the despotic family rule of
the Nehrus, seen as becoming less and less
legitimate and more and more difficult to
sustain without a repressive state apparatus,
as the successive generations of
the family exhibit a progressive decline of
rectitude and a progressive flowering of
ineptitude.

Deeper analysis can wait, but it is
necessary to discuss at least the most
serious of the instruments of this _fascisation_,
i.e., the ongoing fabrication of a
whole new structure to deal with political
opposition to the state. Opposition to the
state, it must be stressed, as distinct from
opposition to the ruling family. Though
it is opponents of the ruling family and
its party who call upon themselves the
exhilarating martyrdom of being the cause
of all the repressive measures, the real
targets lie demonstrably elsewhere.

# 'POLITICAL CRIME'

Central to this structure is the concept
of _political crime_, a concept that was
hitherto used _defensively_ by its sympathisers,
and was rejected by the state
which argued that there was no statutorily
defined notion of political crime in India.
Today the concept is very definitely being
worked into the legal and political structures
as an _offensive_ measure by the state.
In keeping with Indian hypocrisy, it is not
called by its proper name. Hypocrisy
apart, it would be violative of _Articles 14_
and _19_, and it is not yet time to set them
aside statutorily, though one can play
many games with them outside the law
books and the courts. And so political
crime, defined explicitly and unambiguously
as many old crime --- or even no
crime at all --- committed with political intent,
is given a different name, or rather
two meanings. One is terrorism, and the
other is disruptive activity. The names as
well as the 'Objects and Reasons' are
chosen evocatively; the picture one gets is
that of the planting of explosives operated
by the tuning of a transistor radio in a
crowded bus or a busy market; and of the
second dismembering of the motherland
forty years after the first. The statutory
definition of political crime is followed up
with the erection of a whole new legal and
extra-legal structure to deal with it. New
hierarchy of courts, new procedures, new
restrictions on rights, new treatment in
jails, and new weapons to the police --- it
is a completely new structure, not just a
few amendments here and there. It is time
we realised that as we enter into the last
decade of the twentieth century, India very
definitely has two parallel, self-contained
and very nearly mutually exclusive structures
to deal with 'problems of law and
order', one for non-political disorders and
one for political disorders, the latter being
many times more inhuman and antidemocratic
than the former. If political
freedom is the defining quality of a
democracy then we are no longer even a
nominal democracy. The first hint of this
situation was contained in the _Terrorist
and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act_,
(_TADA_) 1985; it was renewed with a
deepening of the meaning when the Act
was renewed with amendments in 1987;
and confirmed by a Supreme Court judgment
of May 1988, delivered by justices
A P Sen and L M Sharma, a judgment
that is evidently innocent of all knowledge
of previous jurisprudence on the 'right to
life'.

Let us begin with the definition of _Terrorism_
(_sec 3_) and of _Disruptive Activity_
(_sec 4_). It is terrorism if anyone causes or
attempts to cause injury or death of a person
or destruction of property or disruption
of essential services, with the aid of
explosives, fire-arms, inflammable substances
or other lethal weapons (which,
taken together, is in any case a crime
under the good old Indian Penal Code,
Explosive Substances Act and the Indian
Arms Act), if the intention of the crime
(it is the _intention_ that makes it terrorism)
is to overawe the government, create terror
in the public, alienate a section of the
people, or adversely affect the harmony
among different sections of the people. Of
these, 'to overawe the government' is a
definitive aim of all political activity; and
'alienating a section of the people' is an
unavoidable concommitant of any struggle
of communities/nationalities which
perceive them selves as oppressed, and
which is also a political struggle, whether
a given perception is true or false. The
point is not that the provisions can be
misused. The point is that this _is_ the
meaning of the provisions, that they
classify crimes committed with political
_intent_ as terrorist crimes, and erect a
basically new structure for the prevention,
investigation and trial of these crimes. The
Act need not be misused, for it cannot be
used otherwise. This is even more clear in
the case of _disruptive activity_. _Section 4_
of _TADA_ defines _disruptive activity_ as activity
that questions, disrupts or is intended
to disrupt, directly or indirectly, the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of
India; or is intended to bring about or is
supportive of any claim for the secession
or cession of any part of India. Here, there
is no need to commit any penal offence,
with or without lethal weapons; if you
believe in what political theory calls _national
self-determination_ you are committing
a crime under _sec 4_, _TADA_, a crime
for which you can be imprisoned for life.
For any belief in _national self-determination_
does 'question' the territorial integrity
of India.

# LEGAL SANCTION FOR TORTURE

Now for the structure that has been
erected. The difference between this and
the structure for ordinary (non-political)
crime --- which of course includes not only
the petty crime indulged in by the indigent
people but also the well-organised, politically
imperative and financially lucrative
crime that is run by people of influence
and power --- is evident from the beginning
to the end. An accused in an ordinary
crime has the right against self-incrimination,
which takes the abstract form of
the 'right of silence' enunciated by justice
Krishna Iyer in the Nandini Satpathy case
and the concrete form of the inadmissibility
of confessions given to a police officer
as evidence in a trial. In a political
crime, under _sec 15_ of _TADA_ (1987), a
confession made to a superintendent of
police --- and recorded in writing, on a tape
recorder or any such devise --- is made admissible
as evidence; and to pretend that
this is compatible with the right against
self-incrimination requires an uncommon
capacity for self-delusion. The police
themselves have in any case revealed quite
joyously that they regard this provision as
a legal sanction for torture. In Andhra
Pradesh, where they have learnt to multiply
and enlarge every such sanction with
their own ingenuity, they were not even extracting
specific confessions. Activists and
sympathisers of the CPI(ML) groups are
arrested, tortured as usual to extract information,
and finally forced on point of
an encounter' threat to put a signature on
a piece of white paper. Later, at leisure,
the police type out whatever confession
they require on the paper and present it
to court as part of the evidence.

But that is later. After the 'confession'
is over and the wounds have all healed,
the accused --- if the accused has come out
alive --- goes to court and from there to jail
on _remand_. Now it is an essential ingredient
of civilised criminal procedure that
if a person who is only accused of an offence
is at all to be deprived of liberty, it
rests with the investigating authorities to
prove the need to do so, and hence that
the courts must review the progress of the
investigation at short intervals to ensure
that the accused is not being unjustly
deprived of liberty. It is from this point
of view that the civil liberties movement
has been critical of the _remand_ provisions
of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC),
especially since magistrates blindly extend
the _remand_ at the end of the two-week _remand_
period without making any attempt
to examine the case diary and the progress
of the investigation. But now, for political
crimes, _sec 20(4)_ of _TADA_ prolongs the
_remand_ period to two full months, and no
argument or explanation is offered, as if
it is self-evident and no argument need at
all be offered for depriving a possibly innocent
person of the basic right or personal
liberty. And the maximum total
period of _remand_ --- by the end of which
either the investigation must come to an
end or the accused must be released on
_bail_ --- has been prolonged to one year,
whereas it is 60 days or 90 days for ordinary
crimes. In this case too, there is no
attempt to justify the new standards by
any objective principle or criterion; its
only sanction is that those who have
enacted the change have the authority to
do so, and since they have chosen to do
So, we must live with it. What it means
is that once a person is arrested in a
political crime he or she can be kept
securely in jail for one full year, with only
six appearances in court; and if, on those
six occasions, the police discover that
there is not enough of an armed escort to
take the prisoner to court, even that formality
is not required. The courts, while
extending _remand_ of undertrials, are no
more insistent on seeing the prisoner than
on seeing the case diary. Even in the case
of ordinary undertrials, who should not
require heavy armed escort, roughly half
the extensions of _remand_ are done _in
absentia_ in our courts.

But this matter of _remand_ is not an
isolated instance. As the judgment of
justices Sen and Sharma referred to above
says: "The Act (_TADA_) is a special Act
and creates a new class of offences called
terrorist acts and disruptive activities ...
and provides for a special procedure for
the trial of such offences ... There is a
total departure from different classes of
criminal courts enumerated in \[the\] CrPC
and a new hierarchy of courts is sought
to be established" (Usmanbhai Dawoodbhai
Memon and others _vs_ State of
Gujarat, May 1988). In replacement of the
multiple hierarchy of courts familiar to ordinary
prisoners, for political prisoners
there exists, for all practical purposes, only
one court: the _designated court_. It may,
and normally does, coincide with the sessions
court of the district or the metropolitan
area, but that is a matter of convenience
and need not be so. Indeed, it is
quite likely that soon we will have
altogether separate courts for trying
_TADA_ offences. From the first _remand_ of
the accused till the final judgment and
sentence, all proceedings will take place
in the _designated court_; and at no stage
till the end can the accused appeal even
to the Supreme Court (the high court has
been defined out of existence for political
prisoners) on any matter pertaining to the
proceedings in the _designated court_. It is
only against the final judgment that the
accused can go on appeal, and then only
to the Supreme Court, and within one
month.

The first casualty in this structure is
_bail_. The civil liberties movement has
always insisted that _bail_ is a right and not
a privilege, and has been critical of our
courts which have treated _bail_ as _charity_.
It is indeed possible to interpret the _remand_
provisions of CrPC along with
_Article 21_ to sustain the civil liberties
stand in this matter. But now, for offences
under _TADA_, it is made explicit that _bail_
is not just a _privilege_ but a _rare privilege_
indeed. The court is not supposed to grant
_bail_ unless it feels that the accused is not
only innocent of the crime alleged, but
also that the accused will not commit any
offence while on _bail_ (_sec 20(8)_). A full
bench of the Punjab and Haryana High
Court, in a recent judgment (Bimal Kaur
Khalsa _vs_ Union of India), found the latter
requirement a little too shocking and
held it _ultra vires_; but even the former puts
too much of a burden of generosity on the
judge: how is the judge supposed to come
to such a magnanimous conclusion before
seeing any of the evidence? Indeed, it is
a surprise that any of the political
prisoners _are_ getting _bail_ at all, and that
about a tenth of them are getting _bail_
must be attributed less to judicial liberality
than to judicial habit. But even so a
large majority of the undertrials in
political cases remain in jail until the entire
trial is over --- which can take anything
from five to fifteen years, since in these
cases a large number of accused, most of
them underground inaccessible, are added
on with the express purpose of delaying
the trial, and the number of witnesses
usually runs into dozens if not hundreds.
In Andhra Pradesh, for instance, there are
at present about 700 political undertrials
in the major jails at Warangal, Rajahmundry,
Visakhapatnam, Secunderabad,
Nizamabad, Karimnagar and Nellore, and
most of them are going to be there for
many more years to come. They are, of
course, entitled to _bail_ at the end of one
year's _remand_, but the courts have been
extremely negligent in the matter of releasing
undertrials who have overstayed their
maximum period of _remand_. And in the
case of political undertrials, the police
usually implicate them in a fresh case at
the end of the _remand_ period, on the basis
of evidence concerning an ancient offence
that has miraculously turned up just then;
or they take a warrant under the _National
Security Act_ just as the _remand_ period is
coming to an end; or they rearrest the
prisoners as soon as they are released, torture
them for a tew days, and implicate
them in a fresh crime under _TADA_, by
planting a fire-arm or an explosive on
them. The prisoners, therefore, have mostly
deemed it prudent to stay in jail until
the trial is over.

# WHAT A TRIAL!

And what a trial! It is here that the
'special procedure' that justices Sen and
Sharma talk about hits you in the face.
There is a thorough massacre of all the
principles of _fair trial_ and _natural justice_
that are formally present in the case of
non-political crimes, though poor persons
usually discover that the fairness is only
nominal. Firstly, "all proceedings before
a _designated court_ shall be conducted _in
camera_" (_sec 16_) unless the public prosecutor,
for whatever imbecile reason,
wants an open trial. (The Punjab and
Haryana High Court has held this provision
too _ultra vires_, but only to the extent
that the discretion lies with the public prosecutor
and not the court; whether the implied
substitution, if made, will mean any
relief to the accused is a moot point.) But
one must be familiar with the lying,
cheating and the fabrication of evidence
that goes on right inside a court hall to
understand the full implications of an _in
camera_ trial. There is a case now pending
with the _designated court_ of Hyderabad
which goes by the name of _Ramnagar
Conspiracy Case_, which has 30 accused
and more than 300 witnesses. The case attracted
attention first because it involves
the entire leadership of the CPI(ML)
(_People's War_), second because the poet
Varavara Rao was also made an accused
in it, though at the time of the FIR in this
case was filed he had been in continuous
detention for more than six months at the
Secunderabad jail, third because the case
got into fantastic complications because
of the inexcusable carelessness of the prosecution,
due to which a situation has
arisen where the judge before whom the
charge sheet has been filed has no jurisdiction
to try the case and it is technically
too late to transfer it to the judge who
would have had jurisdiction if the 1985
Act under which the case is filed had not
lapsed, and fourth because in the midst
of all this confusion, one of the main accused,
Nalla Adi Reddy, secretary of the
_Andhra Provincial Committee_ of the
party, chose to run away from jail on the
17th of September this year along with
three more comrades, two rifles and a lot
of ammunition. The xerox-copied charge
sheet given to the accused in this case
mentions a conspiracy that is supposed to
have taken place in March 1985, whose
minutes are supposed to have been kept
in the handwriting of one of the _Provincial
Committee_ members, A-4 (accused
number 4) in this case. But when a _bail_
application was filed for Varavara Rao
(who is A-14 in the case), it was discovered
that in the typed charge sheet given to the
court the relevant portion had been
tampered with to replace A-4 with A-14;
it was then claimed that since the minutes
of the conspiracy were found recorded in
Varavara Rao's handwriting, his involvement
in the conspiracy was _prima facie_
established and so he should not be given
bail. If such fabrication of evidence can
take place at a stage where the proceedings
are still open, it is easy to imagine the
plight of the accused once the proceedings
become _in camera_.

Secondly, the _designated court_ may not
sit at its usual place of sitting (i.e., the
court hall) but at any place it --- or the
public prosecutor --- wishes (_sec 10_). For instance,
it may sit in the jail itself; or it may
sit in the heart of a locality populated by
the political enemies of the accused. Indeed,
the central government may transfer
the case from the _designated court_ in
whose jurisdiction the alleged crime was
taken place, to any court anywhere in the
country (_sec 11(2)_). Thirdly, the identity
of any of the witnesses for the prosecution
can be kept secret from the accused
either on an application from the witness
or the public prosecutor, or on the court's
own initiative (_sec 16(2)_). Of course, apart
from the public prosecutor's request, the
court's initiative can be caused by events
entirely external to the court proceedings
--- like for instance a phone call from
the local police superintendent. It is not
stated there, but it is evident that if the
identity of a witness is to be kept secret,
then that witness' evidence, as well as the
evidence of other witnesses to the extent
that it concerns or refers to that witness,
may also have to be kept secret from the
accused. Identities cannot be kept secret
by merely writing 'X' in place of the person's
name.

The remarkable thing about these inequities
is that all of them are decided
once and for all by a combination of the
public prosecutor, the _designated judge_,
and the state or central governments, and
the accused cannot go on appeal against
these decisions to the high court or the
Supreme Court. This is in contrast to the
right of appeal that an ordinary prisoner
has against any such decision that the
court or the government may take. This
deprivation of a political prisoner's rights
is ensured by _sec 19_ of _TADA_, and the
elaborate interpretation offered to that
section by justices Sen and Sharma.

The structure of Indian statutes is a
study in hypocrisy. The actual content,
when it is negative in its tendency, is stated
in the form of an exception, and sometimes
even as a parentherical sub-clause,
whereas what is really meant as an exception
is proclaimed as a privilege. _Sec 19_
reads: " ... an appeal shall lie as a matter
of right from any judgment, sentence or
order, not being an _interlocutory order_, of
a _designated court_ to the Supreme Court
both on facts and on law". Since, as their
lordships point out, everything that happens
in the _designated court_ prior to the
final judgment and sentence is an '_interlocutory
matter_', 'the actual meaning of
this section is that: 'there shall be no appeal
whatsoever on any matter pertaining
to the proceedings in a _designated court_
until the final judgment and sentence are
awarded, and then, and only then, an appeal
shall lie with, and only with, the
Supreme Court'. That is a much more
straightforward way of putting it, but
those who draft our statutes do not believe
in such virtues.

Thus, whether the public prosecutor or
the _designated judge_ decides to hold the
trial _in camera_ and inside a jail or in the
courtyard of the political enemies of the
accused, whether they decide to keep the
identities of _all_ the witnesses (and hence
also all their evidence) secret, whether the
central government decides to shift the
case from the _designated court_ of Karimnagar
to the district court on north
Lakshimpur on the Brahmaputra river,
the accused has no right of appeal against
any of these decisions.

# A NEW IDIOM

While this much can be said to be contained
in the act itself, there is a further
gloss put on it by the Supreme Court
judges. They have taken the extraordinary
stand that not only such matters as above
but _bail_ is also an _interlocutory matter_,
and therefore there is no appeal against
a refusal of _bail_ by the _designated court_.
It requires no intricate _punditry_ in
jurisprudence to see the absurdity of this
notion. If the right to life and personal
liberty is a precious right that can be taken
away only on grounds that are fair,
reasonable and just; if it rests with the
authorities to convince the courts that fair
and just reasons exist for depriving a person
of liberty; if prolonged and unreasonable
detention of an undertrial
amounts to illegal custody --- all of which
are assertions made by the same Supreme
Court during the last decade --- then this
understanding that _bail_ be regarded not
in terms of the fundamental right of personal
liberty and the right against
unreasonable restraint, but on par with
summons issued to a witness or applications
for transfer and such other interim
procedural matters, belongs to a different
idiom altogether.

But perhaps we should accept that the
idiom of judicial discourse _has_ changed
from the heyday of judicial liberalism of
the late seventies, and may be we should
wait for one more emergency to see its
rebirth. In the meanwhile, we have to face
this situation where a political prisoner
has to depend upon the mercy of the
_designated judge_ of the locality for the
realisation of such a basic right as _bail_.
This judge, who is generally going to be
a sessions judge of a district town, must
manage to convince himself that the accused
is not guilty and will not commit
offences if released on _bail_; since no
judge --- and certainly no judge who can
be reached on phone by the local sub-divisional
police officer --- will arrive at
that kind of a conclusion without effective
advocacy on the prisoner's behalf, the
prisoner --- a 'terrorist, an 'extremist', an
'insurgent' and what not --- must find an
advocate living in that district town
possessed of enough guts to plead the
case --- and how many such advocates exist
in this or any other country? Andhra
Pradesh provides the answer to the question:
from the 'extremist-infested' districts,
all advocates who would plead with some
degree of commitment have been driven
out, or have given up their commitment
in favour of commercial advocacy, and the
pleading on behalf of the CPI(ML)
undertrials is done mostly by indigent
--- and indifferent --- lawyers holding state
briefs to do the cases for a pittance. The
consequences of this for the prisoners'
rights need not be spelt out.

And so, locked up in a prison without
hope of _bail_, tried in an improvised court
hall located god knows where, denied
knowledge of the full evidence for the prosecution,
defended by a lawyer paid a
nominal amount by the state, the political
prisoner has to obtain justice. And to cap
it all, whereas in a non-political trial the
accused has the basic right of being
treated as innocent until the guilt is proved
by the prosecution, political prisoners
bear the burden of proving their own innocence.
In the law for non-political
crime, the burden of proof is put on the
accused only when the accused pleads
some exception, like self-defence in a
murder case or truthfulness in a defamation
charge; but now politics, apparently,
is itself regarded as an exception to the
normal rule of acquiescence in the
system's inequities.

Of course, there are supposed to be
some conditions under which this presumption
of guilt operates. The Indian
ruling class will not be straightforward
even in its meanness. So there are four
conditions in _sec 21_: (a) arms, explosives
or inflammable substances are recovered
from the accused which, the police (have
reason to) believe have been used in the
commission of the offence in question.
Now, an intelligent person is likely to be
struck by the observation that apart from
fire-arms, the other lethal substances like
explosives and inflammable substances are
not likely to survive the crime that has
been committed with them. But the police
will actually turn this impossibility into
a convenience: if, say, a person goes with
five explosives in hand to commit a crime
with political intent, uses up two of the
explosives and is caught with the other
three, then that is the same as being
caught with lethal weapons used in the
commission of an offence, which fact can
now be turned upside down: arrest a
political activist, plant three explosives on
him or her, and claim that these three are
part of a larger cache the remainder of
which (the police have reason to believe)
was used in the commission of a terrorist
outrage; and then the burden of proving
innocence will fall on the accused. It is to
be seen how many _designated judges_ will
resist this argument. (b) The fingerprints
of the accused are found at the site of the
offence or on anything including arms
and vehicles used in connection with the
commission of the offence. Is it such a difficult
thing for the police, once they have
you in their custody, to get your fingerprints
on to a scooter or some such object
which the police have reason to believe
was used in the commission of an offence?
Surely not. (c) A co-accused has confessed
to the offence and implicated the accused.
There is no need to comment on this,
given the widely known methods the
police use to obtain confessions, and given
also the fact that now a confession need
not mean a confession to a magistrate but
can also be a confession to a superintendent
of police. (d) The accused himself/
herself has confessed to somebody other
than a police officer. The word confession
is a misnomer here, for what is involved
is only an admission made orally or in
writing, and evidence of such admissions
is not a difficult thing to procure. In summary,
then, _sec 21_ says that whenever the
police so wish, the burden of proving innocence
falls on the accused.

# PRISON REGIME

This is about the 'trial', so-called.
Meanwhile, in prison, the political
prisoner again suffers a regime that is
palpably different --- and much more
undemocratic --- than that the non-political
undertrials suffer. Prisons are supposed
to be governed by manuals of rules; these
rules usually differ slightly from state to
state but all of them belong to a subterranean
world that has not heard of things
like justice and fundamental rights. The
hallmark of the manuals is a total arbitrariness:
rules of discipline, procedures for
inquiry and award of punishment are all
arbitrary. And thus, without any need to
define new prison rules for political
prisoners, they can be and are being
treated as a different category of prisoners
to whom even the minimum rights available
to ordinary undertrials are not
available. They are housed separately and
not allowed to mix with the other prisoners
in the same jail; they are not allowed to
come out of their blocks and participate
in the community activities of the
prisoners; the letters they write or receive
and the newspapers and books they get
suffer excessive censorship, a censorship
that has no consideration for the two
legitimate concerns of prison administration:
the prisoners' rights and the prison's
security, but instead is determined by the
dictates of the _special branch_ of the police.
At interviews that political prisoners have
with their families and friends, the
presence of the _special branch_ is
obligatory, and the prisoners are not
allowed to talk anything outside the hearing
of the policemen.

As for 'discipline', for the, slightest
political assertion --- whether it is singing
songs and giving political slogans or
agitating against bad food --- they are given
corporal punishment, thrown in solitary
confinement, or their interviews with their
families and even their lawyers are cut for
a long time period. In Andhra jails, for
instance, it has become customary for
_naxalite_ undertrials to observe a programme
of protest in their barracks on
August 15, while the official flag-hoisting
and sanctimonious speech-making are in
progress outside under the supervision of
the superintendent of the prison. For this
they are punished with a prohibition on
interviews, withholding of letters and
books, and perhaps solitary confinement
for the more vocal of them. If they repeat
their protest on January 26, they are
similarly punished once again. Not only
for these symbolic protests on symbolic
days, for every act of protest directed
against the authorities --- about the quality
of food, lack of medicines, highhandedness
of warders, etc --- they receive a similar
punishment. The upshot is that most of
the political undertrials spend much of
their time in solitary confinement, deprived
of books and newspapers, and deprived
of interviews with friends and family
members.

# POWERS OF EVICTION

Finally, we come to the _Terrorist and
Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Rules_,
made with exemplary haste following the
passage of _TADA_, 1987, _section 28(c)_ of
which confers power on the central
government to make rules which further
confer power on a series of officials ('empowered
authorities') from the _district
magistrate_ upwards to pass _general_ or
_specific orders_ to prevent or cope with
terrorist and disruptive activities.

The rules appropriate quite astonishing
powers. Three categories of places and
areas are specified in _Rules 5, 6_ and _7_ for
regulation, and quite characteristically, a
general power of regulation (of 'certain
places and areas') is added in _Rule 9_. The
_specific places_ and areas are _prohibited
places_ (premises such as government offices,
as defined in the _Official Secrets
Act_), _protected places_ (court rooms, jails,
and any other place so declared by the
'empowered authority'), and _protected
areas_ ('any area so declared' by the 'empowered
authority'). Disregarding inessentials,
the substance of the rules is that
entry into and conduct in these places/
areas is conditional on the issue of a
permit by the empowered authority and
faithful compliance with the conditions
imposed (whatever they may be) as part
of the permit. Those who do not possess
a permit or do not obey the conditions imposed,
can be evicted and in addition imprisoned
for six months. The meaning of
these rules is worthy of emphasis: _any_
_district magistrate_ in _any_ part of the country
can take over any place or area (a
building, a _maidan_, a factory, a highway,
a village) to the extent of deciding whether
_any_ given individual (not necessarily one
who has any kind of a police record --- real
or concocted) shall be or shall not be
allowed to enter the place or area and impose
_any_ conditions whatsoever (do not
make a speech, do not meet X, Y, Z; do
not leave the _gram panchayat_ office; etc)
which that person shall obey on pain of
instant eviction and imprisonment. And
all this in the name of coping with and
'preventing' 'terrorist' and 'disruptive' activities,
and entirely on the _subjective
satisfaction_ of the _district magistrate_. It
is a remarkable exhibition of brazenness
that not even a nominal attempt is made
to place seemingly plausible restrictions
on the places, areas and persons to whom
the rules will apply.

This is not a futuristic scenario, not an
essay on how 'the _TADA_ can be misused'.
This is an account of what is already
largely happening over an increasingly
larger area of the country, and with
respect to an increasingly larger category
of political activists, activists of the
oppressed nationalities and minority communities,
activists of revolutionary
groups, activists of militant trade unions,
tribal activists, and even the office-bearers
of the policemen's association of Gujarat.
There can be any number of opinions
about the nature and advisability of the
politics of the various victims of _TADA_,
but there cannot be, and should not be,
two opinions that this new legal and penal
structure that has been silently erected
over the last three years is an abomination
that we should all collectively fight.
