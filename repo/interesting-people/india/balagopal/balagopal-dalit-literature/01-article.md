I happened to attend the _Lokayan
seminar_ on Gujarati-Marathi _Dalit literature_
as a representative of the Revolutionary
Writers' Association of
Andhra Pradesh, GPD's account of
the seminar (_Economic Political Weekly, January 16_) is not
exactly exceptionable but slightly off-target.
He appears to have missed
what was the most remarkable fact
about the seminar --- its explicitly
political tone. Indeed, had there been
any apolitical or anti-political individuals
at the seminar (mercifully there
were none) they could have legitimately
complained that it was 'politics' that
everybody was discussing and not
literature.

The question that was repeatedly
raised --- rather obliquely by GPD
himself and more explicitly by Manishi
Jani and Punalekar --- was whether
the _Dalit movement_ had any future
ahead of it if it refused to define its
goals. What does the movement wish
to achieve? What particular kind of
liberation does it have in mind? The
Marathi _Dalit writers_ had a routine
answer to this. Arun Kamble says:
"aim of the movement is humanism;
liberty, equality and fraternity; absence
of exploitation". Arjun Dangle
is even more inclusive: "all the revolutions
that have happened anywhere
--- Ambedkar, Phule, Marx,
Mao, Lenin ..." (I only hope I have
not misunderstood their Hindi).
Unfortunately we have seen too many
expansive 'total revolutionaries' to be
happy with such formulations, especially
when Dangle adds: "class antagonism
of the Marxist model does not
exist in India". But perhaps what was
more striking was their indifference
towards the whole question. Their
only response to the deep-felt questioning
of their Gujarati counterpart,
Manishi Jani, was a stony silence. They
had 'arrived', Their poetry had
entered school/college textbooks.
(That is no mean achievement. There
can be no two views on the matter.) As
was even suggested by somebody they
had been co-opted by the ruling
powers. And hence their indifference
to basic questions, an indifference
that was absent among the Gujarati
poets (at a different level, GPD also
has noted this difference in attitude).
Consequently, contrary to GPD's conclusion,
I came away with the impression
that if Marathi _Dalit literature_ is
to "come up with almost revolutionary
answers", a completely new crop of
writers untainted by the politics of
co-option have to come up.

That is one point. The second and
related point is the surprisingly middle
class nature of the whole affair. It is
true that one major theme of _Dalit
poetry_ is rural oppression, but not only
is the writer urban middle class (itself
a debilitating factor) but the attitude
is also middle class. This was reflected
in the lackadaisical manner in which
the discussion on language was conducted.
That _Dalit literature_, after
more than a decade of existence, is
not very serious in coming to grips
even with the primary contradiction
between writing for the oppressed
and yet using the _sanskritised_ language
of the educated is indeed surprising.
If _Dalit writers_ had come to grips
with this problem they would have
discovered --- as revolutionary poets in
Andhra have discovered --- that there
is a whole sea of new problems awaiting
them. For it is only urban middle
class Telugu (or Marathi or whatever)
that has a more or less uniform nature
throughout the state. The moment
you get down to writing in the language
of the rural poor, you enter the
realm of dialects and face a new contradiction:
that between authenticity
and intelligibility. For revolutionary
literature to be authentic and to really
appeal to the people you are writing
for and about, the language has to be
that of the local people; but an
excessively localised dialect makes it
unintelligible to many who speak the
same language. Right now it is this
problem that is being debated most
vigorously --- in the pages of journals
like Varavara Rao's _Srjana_ -- by revolutionary
poets in Andhra. That
_Dalit poetry_ has not yet even recognised
the existence of this contradiction
(surely, the dialect of the rural poor in
Western Maharashtra cannot be the
same as in Aurangabad) appears to
indicate that _Dalit poetry_ as it is today
is quite far from "coming up with
almost \[if not quite?\] revolutionary
answers".
