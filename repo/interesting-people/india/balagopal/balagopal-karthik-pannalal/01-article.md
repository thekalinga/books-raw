A meeting of APCLC[^apclc] held at Hyderabad
to discuss human rights issues, condoled
the sad and untimely death of CPDR[^cpdr] activist,
Kartik Pannalal. Kartik along with two other
friends Jahnavi Phalkey and Sanjay Bonbora
was hit by a bus in Delhi in the night of
June 4-5. He and Jahnavi were returning
from a human rights fact finding visit to
Kashmir and had stopped for a couple of
days at Delhi. Kartik died instantly and the
other two friends are recovering. Kartik's
loss is irreplaceable. He was not only a
dedicated human rights activist but also a
fine human being. He was a generous and
helpful person. His passion for justice was
matched by intellectual curiosity and thirst
for knowledge. We extend our heartful
condolences to Kartik's family and friends.
