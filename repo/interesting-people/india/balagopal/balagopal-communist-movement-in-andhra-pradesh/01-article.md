How we look at an historical event depends upon what we have expected from it. This
principle applies also to the Communist experiment that had its hey day in the century now
past, and is for the present almost wiped out.

If the Communist experiment is understood as a force that stood against the Capitalist system
and the mode of life it offers to humankind, its victories and its failures take on one meaning.
They take on a different colour if we understand it as an experiment to rebuild human
existence on a basis of equality and cooperation. From the second view point, failure is the
judgement one passes on the Communist experiment. It is true that it has given us some
knowledge of what is to be done to build a society based on cooperation and equality, but it
has told us more of what is not to be done. If it is said that that too is knowledge and we
should be grateful for it, then so be it.

But from the first view point, it must be acknowledged that the communist experiment has
done great service. Those who desire socialism cannot but regret today that not even one
Soviet Russia is there to oppose the aggressive assault that Capital is making on the world in
its eagerness to subordinate everything to its domination. The events unfolding before our
eyes during the last decade make it evident that if the communist experiment had never
taken place in this century, the position of the workers, the other oppressed people and the
backward countries would have been much worse.

These observations that apply to the communist movement worldwide apply also to the
history of the communist movement in our State. From one view point they are even more
true. While the communist movement as a whole has failed to give knowledge about how a
new society is to be built, in other countries there are communist leaders and theoreticians
who have proposed some new ideas and tried to put them into practice. Lenin and Mao
within the tradition that gives centrality to violence as an instrument of change, and Gramsci
within the tradition that gives centrality to social intervention, have done so. But not only in
our State, in our country as a whole there is not one leader or theoretician who has
contributed a single new idea to the communist experiment. Not only party leaders, even
among intellectuals within Universities and outside, there are perhaps some who have
exhibited some capability at interpreting Marxist theory more or less competently, but there
is not one who has made a creative contribution to it.

As we suffer from no lack of intelligence, the reason for this must be sought, not in lack of
intellectual capabilities but in our country's philosophical traditions. The _Brahminical
intellectual tradition_ is a tradition of interpreters. There is not one _Brahmin scholar_ who has
said: 'This is my opinion', or 'I am saying this'. As conditions have been ever changing,
they too could not help saying new things once in a while, but even then they went onto
declare that they were only interpreting the _Vedas_. There is no legitimacy for original
thought in the _Brahminical tradition_. This has entered all political movements and found a
new basis in notions such as _discipline_ and _commitment_ and taken firm root. Excepting only
the extraordinary efficiency developed by the _People's War_ in the use of violence (if that
can be said to be useful for the building of a new society), the communist movement in our
State --- or the entire country for that matter --- cannot be said to have made a single original
contribution to the problem of how to achieve the goal of the communist movement.

But this does not mean that the communist movement in our State, or in the whole country,
has achieved nothing at all. We only have to look at our neighbouring States such as Orissa
and Madhya Pradesh to realise how much good has come from there being a communist
movement in our State. Notions such as exploitation, oppression, resistance and rebellion,
and the mode of thought that divides society into rulers and the ruled and analyses society
on the basis of their different interests, have become part and parcel of the social idiom of
our State. It is only when we look at people who are not familiar with this idiom that we
realise its value. It is one thing if people, inspite of being acquainted with this idiom are
unable to overcome oppression. It is quite another thing if people cannot even name the
situation of oppression they are facing, and experience it as a nameless dissatisfaction. Today
these ideas are familiar to all the movements in our State, but it was the communists who
introduced them to the people and made them familiar ideas at the cost of great suffering.

It would be wrong to think that it does not matter if the words are unfamiliar, when the
meaning is known. We need not go so far as the post-modern view that language is all, but
nevertheless if it is realised that language is not merely a means of expression of what we
already 'know', and that it has a role in not only expressing external reality but in bringing
it into our awareness, we will be able to see that the language made available to the people
by the communists has played a major role in making people recognise oppression for what it
is and not suffer it as a vague dissatisfaction.

However, the struggles led by the communists have also provided many material benefits. It
is not necessary to list out the benefits achieved in each village and each factory, but it is
necessary to refer to the changes wrought in government policies. The struggles led by the
communists are the main reason why land reforms took statutory form in India. And the
_naxalite movement_ is the proximate reason for the amendments made to land ceiling laws in
the 1970s reducing the upper ceiling limit. PV Narasimha Rao boasts that it was he who
suggested to Indira Gandhi that the ceiling should be lowered, but it was the _naxalite
movement_ that gave him the idea. And in our State, the constitution of the _Girijan
Cooperative Corporation_, the _Integrated Tribal Development Agency_, and _Regulation 1 of
1970_, all of which are measures that have benefited the tribals to some extent, are a
consequence of the _Srikakulam tribal struggle_.

However, the impact that the communists had on people's consciousness and on
government policies was not merely a reflection of their physical strength. The communist
movement had a moral strength over and above that. It was believed that they stood for
justice, that they would not compromise with corruption, that they did not fear sacrifice and
that they had no fear of repression. It cannot be said that the opinion is no longer current at
all, but it has certainly become very weak. And to the extent that it has become weak, the
influence of the communists has also become weak.

This began from the time the _CPI_ joined hands with the Congress. One does not know what
the _CPI_ gained or lost organisationally (that is to say in numbers, in organisational strength,
in commitment and in the impact of its agitations) from this alliance, but it lost a lot in terms
of moral respect and recognition. The same thing happened again later, when the _CPI_ and
_CPI(M)_ went about hand in hand with the _Telugu Desam Party (TDP)_ for about a decade. Those
parties found it difficult to even recognise this fact because the moral concern has no clear
place in the theoretical world view adopted by the communists. The moral dimension has no
independent place in the communist world view but only an instrumental role in debunking
the ruling classes and attracting the masses. There is no ethical standard that can explain why
the 'exigencies of the struggle' are not above moral concerns. For this reason, _CPI_ and
_CPI(M)_ not only found it possible to have an alliance with the _Telugu Desam Party_,
but also on many occasions take the side of that party's leader in the internal conflicts of that
party and abuse his opponents as enthusiastically as his cadre. It does not appear to have
struck them that all this may not be necessary for a mere electoral alliance.

It is because of the germination of these traits in the _CPI_ in the sixties that when the _naxalite
movement_ came up, it attracted as much moral support as political following. The fact that
the _CPI_ later all but merged with the Congress, and in our State likewise in subsequent years
the _CPI_ and _CPI(M)_ identified themselves almost totally with the TDP led to an increased
attraction on this score for the _naxalite movement_. In Telangana one could hear it said about
the _naxalites_ right up to the nineties: 'I differ with their theoretical view point but I respect
their values and integrity'. Today the likelihood of such sentiments being expressed about
the _naxalites_ has decreased a lot. It is needless to quote instances and examples.

It is necessary that all the Communist Parties regain this lost strength. The _CPI_ and _CPI(M)_
are working independently after a long time. If they can convince the people that this is not
a short term tactic but a principled decision (if indeed that is so) they will regain the moral
right to criticise the system. The strength that will accrue to them thereby is not slight. The
_naxalite parties_ too should learn to follow certain basic values in the collection of funds, in
the use of force, in the tactics they adopt to resolve problems, in the methods followed for
tackling differences among themselves and in the way they deal with others working among
the masses. If the communists are to stand by the poor and oppressed people and help them
confront the problems created by economic restructuring, this is very essential.

These changes pertaining to their method of functioning are, however, not sufficient if the
communist movement is to advance towards its goal of an egalitarian society. That would
require theoretical rethinking. But none of the communist parties has succeeded in giving a
satisfactory answer even to the main theoretical doubts raised in recent times. Not only the
parties, but even the intellectuals whose main vocation is to work in the theoretical field
have not been able to do so. The questions of caste and gender can be taken as two examples.
They are giving some answers to the question as to how historical materialism understands
these issues which appear to satisfy them, but their explanations have not been able to carry
conviction with others --- with even a few others.

I do not know whether the communist movement can ever overcome this theoretical lacuna,
but let us hope that it will regain the material strength and moral legitimacy required to
stand by the poor and help them fight capitalist exploitation, which task it has amply proved
it can effectively play in the course of the past century. This will be very necessary in the
coming days.
