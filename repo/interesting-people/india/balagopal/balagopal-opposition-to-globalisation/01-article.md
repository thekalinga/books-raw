_Globalisation_, _World Bank_ style, has followers world-wide among governments and the elite.
But _Globalisation_ has opponents worldwide, too. Normally the opposition would have remained
fragmented and unconnected, for the opposition forces do not have the wherewithal to come
together. But over the last few years efforts are on to bring the opposition together at one place
once in a while.

Such an effort would serve two purposes. One is that the powerful forces of _Globalisation_ will be
forced to see the spectacle of large numbers opposing their designs. The other is that diverse
movements, organisations and people who oppose _Globalisation_ for different reasons will come
to one place and listen to each other. Normally they do not. When they talk at all, they talk over
each other but never to each other.

There are leftist political groups of various shades of red who believe that _Globalisation_ is only
an intensification of capitalist exploitation, and that the fight against it is part of the struggle
against capitalism. There are groups who confine their activity to opposing specific
consequences of the neo-liberal economic policies and philosophy that _Globalisation_ as a
politico-economic tendency promotes world-wide. They include environment groups, artisan
groups, housing rights groups, etc. Some of them may believe that a total global perspective on
all aspects of capitalist exploitation is an unrealistic aim. Some may not want to take a 'political'
sounding stand because they are financed by western funding agencies. And there may also be
some who are not against capitalism or the market economy as such, but believe that in the form
of neo-liberalism it lacks the minimal human concern that civilised existence demands. Now all
of them should come to one place to express opposition to _Globalisation_ and its principal
international agents, the _World Bank_, the _IMF_[^imf] and the _WTO_[^wto], without giving up the specifics of
their point of view. Each can express their opposition in their own political idiom, but gather at
one place to do so, so that the sheer volume of opposition to the dominant global economic
policy idiom is made clear to all. And by the way they can talk to each other, and understand if
not accept each other's view point.

The idea took birth at a place called Porto Allegro in Brazil, where opponents of _Globalisation_
gather each year at the same time when the _World Economic Forum_ of the big powers meets to
decide how to divide up the world. It called itself the _World Social Forum_ to make the point that
social concern is missing from the economic policy prescriptions that the _World Economic
Forum_ is imposing upon the _Third World_. It has rightly added 'discrimination' to _Globalisation_
as the opposite pole against which it defines itself, for the marginalisation that neo-liberalism
implies for the resource-less is accentuated by systematic discrimination on grounds of race,
religion, gender, ethnicity, region and caste, in the Indian case.

The _World Social Forum_ is protest against _Globalisation_ going global. The idea being that the
revolution in modern technology enables protest against its masters to go global too. It is an
attractive idea, but there is only one source of unease. To go global requires funds, and
globalisation of protest is liable to be dominated by those who have access to the requisite funds.
In the good old days, when organisations had no more funds than what their members and
sympathisers could contribute, this would have meant, more or less, that those organisations that
have greater following and greater public support would dominate such an event. Of course, in
those days any global protest of the weak and the vulnerable would have been unthinkable. As
organisations became adept at raising money by means other than plain sympathy, a certain
imbalance between degree of popular support and financial capability crept in, but it is only after
the funded organisations entered the arena of _people's movements_ that the imbalance has
become pronounced. _People's movements_ tend to be represented in international gatherings by
those who have access to funds, who are not those who are truly representative of the ideas and
aspirations of the masses. It is unlikely that the _World Social Forum_, an otherwise very attractive
idea, will be able to totally overcome this imbalance. But it must make an effort reduce it as
much as possible.

The founder of the _World Social Forum_, Mr Chico Whitaker of Brazil, is in the city this Friday.
He will be announcing that Hyderabad has been chosen as the venue of the Asian event of the
_World Social Forum_, to be held next January. Delegates from all over Asia and of course all the
Indian States will be here to hold seminars, workshops, public hearings, street theatre, book
exhibitions and cultural programmes of various kinds to highlight the evil consequences of neo-liberalism,
and to assert confidently that 'another world is possible'.

Let us hope it will make a qualitative difference to the protests that this State has repeatedly
witnessed against _World Bank_ imposed restructuring.
