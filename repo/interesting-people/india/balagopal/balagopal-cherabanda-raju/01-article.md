Cherabanda Raju, the revolutionary
Telugu poet who died on
July 2 (see Obituary, EPW, July 24),
leaves behind his wife, whose tireless
and affectionate care kept him
alive longer that he would otherwise
have lived, and two children. He
neglected their welfare in his single-minded
devotion to the revolutionary
cause and they are today without any
independent means of subsistence. It is
the duty of all friends of the Indian
revolution to help them. A fund has
been set up for the purpose, and contributors
may send whatever they can
afford to:

| 
| K V Ramana Reddy,
| 11--33--957,
| Kavali,
| Andhra Pradesh,
| Pin -- 524202.
