It is said that when the First World War broke out, the European liberal intelligentsia was
shocked as much as it was saddened. It was somehow thought in enlightened European circles at
the beginning of the twentieth century that the Franco-Prussian war was the last war of their
history, and that European history, at any rate, had outgrown the juvenility of wars. The First
World War was a shocking message that this opinion was an illusion as juvenile as any.

The adventures of Bush Jr (and his friend, the one and only Blair) in Iraq --- preceded by
Afghanistan --- must have sent a similar shock to the many who must have believed that humanity
in the twenty-first century has put behind it the more crude forms of belligerence, at any rate in
the more 'advanced' parts of the world, advanced not only in the language of human rights and
values in common use, but also in the degree to which civil rights are protected and respected
within those countries.

If I say that this too was an illusion, and that it was bound to be shattered one day or another, I
am not being cynical about the extent to which civil and political rights of citizens are in fact
protected in the countries of Bush & Blair (hereinafter, _B & B_). No, it would be not only
uncharitable but also unreal to dismiss the civil rights regimes of the lands of _B & B_ as fake. I
am aware that Noam Chomsky has said some very uncharitable things about US democracy. But
he was referring to the extent to which US citizens in fact shape their own future --- the ultimate
test of political democracy. That may well be slight, and Chomsky may well be right in his
criticism, and yet the individual freedoms and civil rights of citizens may well be respected to a
considerable degree. I think that, inspite of the numerous and well documented instances of
violation of the rights of citizens in those countries, especially those of ethnic minorities, there is
little doubt but that the citizens of the countries ruled by _B & B_ do enjoy well protected personal
and civic freedoms. The illusion lies in believing --- as many otherwise intelligent people seem to,
or at least seemed to until Iraq happened --- that a State that respects its own citizens' rights must
necessarily, in some essential sense, respect the civil and political rights of other people as well,
and if that does not happen, then there is something unnatural about it.

In fact, the saga of the imperial adventures of the European States and the US must have
shattered this illusion long ago. The US, in particular, has made it clear ever since its war against
Mexico in the year 1846 that it cares just about nothing for the rights of foreigners who stand in
its way. It has, for the last one hundred and fifty years, declared this fact again and again through
its actions: in Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, Chile, Palestine, Korea, Vietnam,
Laos, Kampuchea, Iran, the Balkans, the Arab countries in general, Afghanistan, and Iraq over
the last decade (the more knowledgeable reader will forgive any inadvertent omissions). And the
Europeans are not far behind, though being (as they themselves will proudly say) less crude than
their transatlantic cousins they have invented less transparent fig leaves. And all of them have
done so even as they went on improving the content of the civil right regimes of their own
countries.

I do not agree with the kind of radicals who would argue that these States could improve the civil
rights content of their internal regimes only because they trampled upon every body else's civil
rights. In fact this belief is of a piece with its opposite: that a regime that respects civil and
political rights within its boundaries will necessarily be more democratic towards other nations
and societies. This liberal illusion and its radical alternative owe equally to a belief that is
quintessentially that of the European enlightenment, and would not seem so obvious or natural to
other traditions of thought. I am referring to the belief in the essential unity or one-ness of Good,
that if something is really good in one aspect it must necessarily be good in other aspects too
(and its corollary: that if it is known to be bad in one aspect, its seeming goodness in another
aspect must be illusory). This belief that is deeply ingrained in the point of view of the European
enlightenment is a characteristic of what we know as modern thought, in its liberal as well as
Marxist variants.

Once we give up this illusion, and accept what we all know to be true, namely that the Good is as
fractured as the Bad, we will cease to be surprised that the Americans and the English can
criticise harshly and even lampoon their war-mongering leaders at will, even as _B & B_ plumb the
depths of imperial savagery, and the two can go on parallelly. We will then realise that even a
world full of countries with impeccable democratic credentials internally will not necessarily be
a just world in international relations. The effort for a democratic community of nations will
have to be structured minus any such _a priori_ beliefs. Such a structure will be informed by the
experience of the last half a century of the United Nations --- presently the favourite football of
the Americans --- and will not trust the sense of justice of any member State: whether on the
ground that it is a working democracy, or that it is a working socialist State, or that its citizenry's
mean skin colour is fair enough to inspire faith in its wisdom (a belief that seems to be becoming
more and more unabashedly popular with official ideologues in the West).
