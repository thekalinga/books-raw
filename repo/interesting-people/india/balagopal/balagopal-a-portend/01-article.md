Narra Prabhakar Reddy, Convenor of the
Warangal district unit of _APCLC_[^apclc] was shot
dead at his residence on the morning of
December 7. We have no hesitation in declaring
that the killers were policemen. Contrary
to the impression sought to be purveyed by
the police, there is no connection between
this murder and the prior killing of former
minister Hayagrivachary. The police of
Warangal have ample reason to hate
_APCLC_, and in particular Prabhakar Reddy.
They took advantage of the killing of the
former minister, killed Prabhakar Reddy,
and are trying their best to make it appear
that this murder was a sequel to the first.

[^apclc]: Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee.

The Warangal district unit of _APCLC_,
which had become inactive after the
police killed the district unit president
Dr Ramanadham in 1985, was revived last
August and has been working very actively.
The police have come to see it as an obstacle
to the _rule of the jungle_ that they have let
loose in the district. The district unit of
_APCLC_ has been exposing the daily police
assault on villages, and the frequent 'encounters'
that have been taking place ever
since D T Naik took over as SP of the
district. The police apparently decided that
unless they kill one more civil liberties leader
in Warangal, they cannot get rid of this
thorn in their flesh. This is the reason behind
the deliberate murder of Prabhakar Reddy.

Prabhakar Reddy did his best to obstruct
the lawless acts of the police not only as a
civil liberties activist, but also in his capacity
as a lawyer, as secretary of the _Warangal Bar
Association_, as '_sarpanch_' of his native
village Veldanda, and as a member of
_Narmetta Mandal Praja Parishad_. He was
especially effective in obstructing the arbitrary
use of _TADA_[^tada] in the district. The
police have been using _TADA_ as a means of
obstructing the _right to bail_ and keeping the
accused in jail for months together. The
Warangal police have filed _TADA_ cases
against nearly 1,250 poor peasants and
labourers in the last three years. Prabhakar
Reddy foiled their efforts effectively by arguing
bail petitions tirelessly day in and day
out and getting all the arrested persons
released on bail very quickly. He would not
even charge any fees from them. As all the
accused were poor people and all the cases
were falsely foisted, he would even bear the
costs himself. There is perhaps no other
lawyer in the country who has fought _TADA_
so effectively inside court halls. It is no secret
that this achievement of his enraged the
police. About two months ago the Narmetta
police implicated Prabhakar Reddy in a false
case of land grab. When the local people
asked the DSP Jangaon why this false case
had been foisted on him, that police officer's
reply was: "We take so much trouble to book
people in _TADA_ cases and arrest them and
this man gets them released free of charge
in as little time as it takes us to type the
remand papers. Do you expect us to keep
quiet?!" During interrogation of suspects in
lock-up, the DSP Warangal (Rural) has also
frequently said that the police have with
them a list of lawyers and civil liberties
activists whom they would soon 'take care
of' and that Prabhakar Reddy's name was
at the top of the list.

[^tada]: Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act aka TADA. This is one in a series of most draconian anti-people, anti-civil liberties laws enacted by Indian Parliament one after another to curtail political dissent in the name of "national security". This law is the predecessor to Prevention of Terrorism Act aka POTA, whose provisions are later incorporated into Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act aka UAPA.

The Warangal police are also angry that
_APCLC_ has foiled their efforts to render
persons 'missing' from lock-ups. _APCLC_
agitated about the 'disappearance' of
Bhadraiah of Akkampet at the hands of the
Atmakur police and got the case referred to
the justice _T L N Reddy Commission_.
Prabhakar Reddy personally took pains to
bring witnesses to the Commission and get
their statements recorded. Recently the
Madikonda police arrested two youth of
Dharmasagar on November 11 and secretly
spirited them away from the lock-up on the
night of November 16 with the intention of
making them 'disappear'. _APCLC_ made a
timely intervention and saved their lives by
bringing the matter to the notice of the press
and the _sub-divisional magistrate (RDO)_.

It is almost exactly a year ago that the
police firing at Narmetta took place. Subsequent
to the firing the police implemented
severe repressive measures in the villages of
Narmetta Mandal --- 353 villagers were implicated
in three _TADA_ cases. Prabhakar
Reddy mobilised the other _sarpanches_ of the
_mandal_ and worked very effectively to face
this repression.

There are many such reasons for the
hatred the Warangal police have for _APCLC_,
and in particular for Prabhakar Reddy. And
yet the district unit of _APCLC_ has been
unhesitatingly helping the district administration
in solving many problems. It
has helped the _Agricultural Marketing Committee_,
the _Chamber of Commerce_, the
_Lorry Owners Association_ and the _A P State
Road Transport Corporation_ in tackling
problems.

In recent times there have been regular
meetings of the officials of the states of AP,
Maharashtra, MP, Orissa and Bihar on the
'extremist problem'. The police are being
trained in the use of the most modern
weapons. A large number of armed personnel
belonging to the _CRPF_[^crpf], _BSF_[^bsf], and _ITBP_[^itbp]
have been deployed in the north Telangana
districts and the agency areas of coastal AP.
The home minister has been declaring that
more forces will soon be brought to the state.
The most modern weapons and the lawless
authority to indulge in arbitrary violence are
being given to the local police as well as the
_Special Task Force (STF)_ and the _Special
Striking Force (SSF)_.

[^crpf]: Central Reserve Police Force (_CRPF_) is the police force of the Govt of India.

[^bsf]: Border Security Force (_BSF_) of Govt of India.

[^itbp]: Indo-Tibetan Border Police (_ITPB_) of Govt of India.

The home minister declares that all this
is meant for countering the armed squads
of the _naxalites_, but the experience of the
last 20 years tells us eloquently what it is actually
meant for. 81 persons have been killed
in 'encounters' in the last one year since
the Janardhan Reddy government came to
power. Hardly half a dozen of the victims
are members of armed squads. The rest are
ordinary people --- sympathisers of the _naxalite_
movement, their legal activists, or
unarmed rural militants. In the last six years
of implementation of _TADA_ nearly 10,000
persons have been accused of _TADA_
offences in this state in the name of being
_naxalites_. Hardly a hundred of them are
members of armed squads the rest are
landless poor who have occupied landlords'
land, sympathisers of _naxalite_ politics, those
who have attended their meetings, those who
have provided them with food or shelter, and
so on. The police have been justifying the
arms and the illegal powers they have been
given by the government by invoking the
need to apprehend armed _naxalites_, but have
been using the arms and the licence against
the landless poor, the peasants, the workers
and the tribals who are the social and
economic beneficiaries of the _naxalite_ movement.
This hypocritical tactic is being
deliberately pursued by the government. We
apprehend that the meaning of the recent
threats of further repression and 'crackdown'
is that this violence on the poor and the
oppressed is going to be doubled. We feel
that the statements being issued by the SP
of Adilabad in the wake of the recent
Tulasipet 'encounter' are symptomatic of
what is to come. He has declared that he has
instructed his police to open fire on _naxalites_
even if they are found assembled with tribals
to discuss the drought situation.

We appeal to all those who cherish
democratic values to condemn the murder
of Prabhakar Reddy. We demand that the
SP Warangal should be kept under suspension
and a _Judicial enquiry_ should be
ordered into the murder of Prabhakar Reddy.
We demand that the state government
should send back the _CRPF_, _BSF_ and _ITBP_
forces. While ensuring the maintenance of
law and order by lawful means, it should
concentrate on the solution of problems of
landlessness, drought, rural unemployment,
etc.
