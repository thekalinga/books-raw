Over the last decade, the people
of Andhra Pradesh have been
hearing of killer gangs
describing themselves by various
names, such as '_Green Tigers_',
'_Tirumala Tigers_', '_Kranti Sena_', etc.
Now we are hearing of '_Narsa Cobras_'
and '_Kakatiya Cobras_'. Threats are
publicly being issued by these outfits,
mainly to persons working in civil
rights organisations or various mass
organisations, alleged by these outfits
to be close to the _Naxalites_. That these
are not idle pranksters is attested by
the fact that they have owned up to a
number of murders.

_Green Tigers_ claimed to have killed
T Purushotham and Azam Ali, both of
the _Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties
Committee_ (_APCLC_), in the years 2000
and 2001 respectively. Someone calling
himself Singamalai of _Tirumala Tigers_
claimed to have kidnapped and
tortured G Laxman of _APCLC_ in the
year 2004. The _Kranti Sena_ claimed to
have killed a number of rural
supporters of the _People's War_ group
in the 1990s. One person claiming the
name of Haribhushan used to
repeatedly threaten Burra Ramulu
and other office-bearers of _Human
Rights Forum (HRF)_ at Warangal.
Now, we hear of the _Narsa Cobras_
who have proclaimed the killing of
Kanakachari, teacher and democratic
activist of Mahbubnagar district.
Apart from killing the above-named
persons, these outfits have repeatedly
been issuing public statements
threatening to kill a long list
of activists of various mass
organisations.

Though this has been going on for
more than a decade now, the
government's response has been a
deafening silence. Who are these
faceless gangs? How can the
government of any civilised country
turn a blind eye to the presence of
self-proclaimed killer groups in the
midst of society? How is it that the
government has not a word to say
about them? In the case of the
_Naxalites_, the police do a thorough
investigation and have in their
possession all the personal details of
the leaders and cadre of the _Naxalite_
groups. A hunt goes on for them day
and night. Many are arrested and some
are killed. But how is it that by
contrast there is not even an
acknowledgement from the government
or the police about these gangs? It is
as if they do not read the papers and
have never seen the claims these outfits
make to the authorship of crimes of
violence, and the threats they hold out
to activists.

Would it be unfair to conclude from
this that the government is not
unhappy to have these vigilante
gangs around? Perhaps because what
the government cannot directly do,
these anonymous killer gangs can, and
the former --- if challenged --- can pretend
to be busily investigating the matter.
In all the crimes of violence listed
above, some investigation has been
done, some individuals have been
charge-sheeted, and tried and
acquitted by the courts. But there is
not a word about the gangs
themselves. What has the investigation
revealed about the _Green Tigers_, the
_Tirumala Tigers_, the _Kranti Sena_, the
men called Singamalai and
Haribhushan? And what investigation
has been taken up about _Narsa Cobras_
and _Kakatiya Cobras_? As
Haribhushan was foolish enough to
issue threats even during the "peace
period" of 2004--05 when the
government could not ignore such
complaints, he was identified and
arrested. He turned out to be an
ex-police constable by the name Javed.

But he had no personal grievance
against the _HRF_ whose office-bearers
he used to threaten. He was
somebody else's tool. Who set him
up? Was his criminal activity
unknown to the higher-ups of the
Warangal police? As for the rest of
these gangs, the silence of the
government continues.

This is a matter of the credibility of
the government as much as the safety
and security of the people. After all,
the gangs are operating in public and
indulging in extortion, threats and
homicide in broad daylight.
