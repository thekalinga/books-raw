The _naxalite_ movement in Andhra Pradesh
is now nearly three decades old. It has many
victories and much unanswered criticism to
its discredit, It has shaped thousands of
activists and inspired people a hundred times
more in number. It therefore claims that it
is the realisation of "the people's" subjectivity,
notwithstanding the qualms of sceptics who
can see no way that the people can impose
their will on it. Its cadre have died and killed
in numbers of the same order, if not in
precisely equal number, and whether they
have died or killed it has been an equally
merciless death. The terror it inspires is no
less than that of the police, though unlike
the police it also inspires a lot of affection.
Outside the tribal areas it has not really
succeeded in realising its principal slogan
of 'land to the tiller' (which in practice
usually means land to the landless, a
difference that is neither understood nor
theorised), but it has succeeded in turning
the power relations of rural Telangana society
upside down. It has produced innumerable
poets and singers from the toiling
communities, given briefs and a purpose to
many young lawyers, and inspired the ideas
of teacher-intellectuals in provincial
universities, colleges and schools as well as
other white-collar sections of society in the
small towns. This intellectual outcrop has
perhaps distinguished itself more in
passionate commitment than in intellect, but
its very existence is an achievement of sorts
and a bulwark against the kind of reaction
which newly educated sections are else where
co-opted or themselves prone to. It has put
power in the hands of raw youth of
traditionally powerless communities, given
them bombs and guns and a world-view to
guide their use, but left hanging in the air
the uncomfortable questions stemming from
the often arbitrary and always ruthless way
that power is being exercised. More vitally,
perhaps, it has no real answer to the question
how the revolution it plans to bring about
is going to differ in its shape and its fate from
all the communist revolutions that have been
and gone in this century, except to reiterate
to its own evident satisfaction that 'the people'
will solve all problems, which anyway appear
insuperable only to intellectuals, or
(alternately) that some difficulties do not
exist and the residue will be taken care of
by the 'cultural revolution'.

Quite surprisingly, there is no study worth
mentioning about this very remarkable
phenomenon. No intellectual working in any
of the universities of AP including those
inspired by the _naxalite_ movement, has taken
the trouble of making a serious study of the
_naxalite_ phenomenon. The dilemma of the
inspired ones is understandable, for they
have learnt from the communist revolutionary
movement a theory of society and social
change but are yet to craft for themselves
the equipment necessary to apply it creatively
to complex contemporary events. Moreover,
they have not yet learnt to face the subject-object
--- or commitment-objectivity
 --- dilemma that is characteristic of philosophies
such as Marxism for which the analysis is
part of the act and every act is an analysis.
They have learnt that it is not enough to write
history but one must be part of the making
of history; that to be part of it is to be partisan
with the revolution that is making it, and in
particular with the _vanguard_ of the revolution;
and that the true partisan is the true scientist
and the true scientist is the true partisan. This
view docs not altogether rule out the
possibility of criticism, but where the act and
the reflection arc in truth aspects of one and
the same, criticism can only be self-criticism.
To realise and remedy the inadequacy of this
_in full_ requires a multilinear, humanist (and
perhaps also contingent) revision of Marxism.
But even without that, Marxist intellectuals
elsewhere have led themselves through the
philosophical churning that makes possible
liberation from political tutelage while
keeping one within history. Such a churning
is yet to take place among the ranks of
revolutionary partisans in Andhra Pradesh.

But if the partisans are not writing history
because of their own dilemmas, neither have
the intellectual opponents and critics of the
communist revolutionaries produced any
work of substance criticising it. What exist
are the documents and understandably onesided
reports produced by the revolutionaries
themselves, the equally one-sided and abusive
leaflets produced by other political parties
(including one _naxalite_ group about another)
and the '_benami_' publications of the police
who have a penchant for producing (very
abusive) pamphlets in the name of "the
people", "the people's voice", etc.

But one book has now come into existence.
It is by a policeman, and not an ordinary one
at that. Aravinda Rao is inspector general
of police, presently head of the _Special
Intelligence Bureau (SIB)_ of the AP Police,
the plainclothes sleuths and murderers
deployed to apprehend and kill _naxalites_,
their sympathisers, and whoever else is
perceived as obstructing the _anti-naxalite_
operations of the police. This _SIB_ includes
the armed hatchet-men called '_greyhounds_',
a specially trained and equipped anti-guerrilla
police force. That the first analytical study
of the _naxalites_ of AP should come from the
head of these human hounds is a testimony
to the sad state of affairs prevalent in the
state. The social system which the communist
revolutionaries are out to overthrow has
allotted the entire task of meeting the
challenge to the police: not only the challenge
to society's orderly life, which is
understandable, but the challenge to its
politics, its ethics and its philosophy as well.
Policemen are by training and orientation ill-equipped
to undertake this task, but the police
of Andhra Pradesh are quite merrily engaging
themselves in it, much to the discomfiture
of even moderately sensitive souls. A
viewpoint that begins with _order_ as the central
good and searches in all unconventional
behaviour --- individual or group --- for its
potential for _disorder_ --- hidden or explicit, is
singularly ill-suited for understanding social
or political rebellions, or even the sociology
of crime, for that matter. But it has been the
fate of Andhra Pradesh that the voice of the
police is the loudest and most confident in
analysing and explaining the _naxalites_ and
their struggles. The day-to-day expressions
of police pedantry are usually very embarrassing.
This book is not quite as crude, but is
nevertheless unmistakably _khakhi_[^khakhi] in its tenor.

[^khakhi]: Refers to Police in India as civilian facing police wear khaki color dress.

That the politicians who lack the slightest
vestige of moral authority to face the _naxalites_
or any other principled political dissenters,
have given up the task of meeting the _naxalite_
challenge politically is perfectly
understandable --- though not excusable --- for
whatever their degeneration they happen to
represent the legitimate face of society's
politics. But what is difficult to comprehend
is the abdication of all responsibility by
society as a whole to engage the _naxalite_
movement in a rational debate about its
methods and its means, its theory and its
practice, its analysis of society's problems
and its idea of their resolution. Society as
a whole (its official face) and all parts of it
minus the police have withdrawn into total
silence and let the men in uniform conduct
the debate at the crude level which alone is
possible for them. One cannot blame the
police for filling this vacuum, for once their
gun is set up as the only answer to _naxalism_,
the gun must necessarily acquire a philosophy
and a morality to match those professed by
the communist revolutionaries. One can of
course rue it, for the only philosophy and
morality possible for the police is a reductionist
exercise that brings everything down to
_order_ and _disorder_, as intellectuals who find
themselves caught in philosophical discussion
with policemen who have been allowed
to become society's total answer to all dissent
discover soon to their frustration. For to be
under constant pressure to engage in such
a dialogue can quickly deaden all that is
subtle and sensitive in the human potential.

The blame however should be put on what
is usually called _public opinion_, which
watches in silence as the battle between _the_
two guns goes on and allows the guns to
appropriate for themselves the sole right to
speak on behalf of society and its future. The
vision of the communist revolutionaries, the
theory of human existence that supports it,
and the strategic means that are supposed
to realise it go unquestioned, and the moral
and intellectual authority of the police to
answer this vision goes unchallenged. A
constant problem with weapons is that they
dominate not merely physically but soon
also intellectually and morally. Such is the
nature of the impact of power in general on
human beings, and weapons whether intended
for good or bad are a sure source of power.
Though, to recognise this aspect of human
frailty is not to condone the cowardice that
allows it to pass and makes no effort to
overcome it. The human species distinguishes
itself as a moral creature, and it is an important
moral principle evolved in the course of
civilisation that truth shall not be exclusively
declared by power and authority.

# _NAXALISM_ AND TERRORISM

The title of the book is _Naxalite Terrorism_,
which is itself indicative of the central theme
of Aravinda Rao's thesis; _naxalism_ _is_
terrorism, and that is that. That the _naxalites_,
in particular the _CPI(ML)_ (_People's War_),
employ terror as a political instrument is a
fact, and quite often an unpleasant fact, but
that is not to say that it is not a political
movement. It is primarily and centrally a
political movement, that is a movement
concerned with fighting and altering the
existing status of and relations between
classes in society. Terror is one of the means
it employs. Its social base is the poor and
the oppressed, not in the sense that all the
poor and the oppressed are its supporters,
nor that it takes approval from those people
for its strategies and decisions, but in the
sense that its politics is oriented in their
favour and the considerable support it has
is among them. But perhaps to see the poor
as the 'base' of the _naxalites_ is to make them
an attribute of the _naxalite_ movement:
something that it has. That is not an entirely
wrong way of seeing it, but misses out a very
important fact, that behind the _naxalite_
movement is a strong aspiration of the
oppressed for a more tolerable existence.
This is the positive sense in which 'the
masses' enter the _naxalite_ phenomenon,
which is not equivalent to saying that the
politics of the _naxalites_ is the highest political
expression of popular aspirations, a claim
that the communist revolutionaries make
and on which is based their appropriation
of permanent justification for all that they
do in the name of the 'objective' interests
of the people. A given popular aspiration can
have different possible political expressions,
and it cannot be assumed _a priori_ that one
_of them must_ necessarily be 'objectively' the
highest expression, though judgment of the
relative merits --- on the whole or in matters
of detail --- cannot be precluded on grounds
of dogmatic relativism and epistemological
nothingness, if and when it is possible.

Thus, when we speak of _naxalism_ we
speak of three elements mixed in a particular
way: a specific politics, a rather extensive
social base, and ruthless terror as a means.
The social base has two faces: on the one
hand it is the support of the _naxalites_ and
on the other it signifies aspirations of the
subjugated masses. In Aravinda Rao's
analysis, the first of the three is totally missing.
The third, that is terror, is dominant. The
movement _is_ terror and its politics is only
a pretence, an excuse. As for the popular
base it has, yes that is acknowledged at a
couple of points, and even the economic and
social causes espoused by the _naxalites_ are
listed out in detail, but the people enter the
picture only in the form of a gullible mass
whose problems are 'used' by the terrorists
to further their nefarious aim which is (it
appeals from his account) to terrorise and
terrorise and terrorise. "Ideology is only a
pretext for terror". As against this, there is
the attitude of the _naxalites_ themselves: we
are the people and the people are us. The
reality is not located somewhere between
these notions, but rather it swings between
them. The _naxalites_ do not just 'use' the
people. They have genuine sympathy for
and identification with them (which does not
preclude lording it over them on occasion);
they genuinely reflect the aspirations of the
people, though as argued above there is
nothing to justify the appropriation of those
aspirations for a permanent justification of
all their politics; most of their cadre and
leaders come from the very same people
whom they claim to speak exclusively on
behalf of, though that circumstance does not
necessarily justify the claim. The struggles
led and waged by the _naxalites_, and even
part of the terror employed by them, has
benefited the poor and the oppressed
immensely, a benefit that is perverse to
describe as a mere 'pretext' for terror. Yet
the decisions taken and the strategies and
tactics adopted by the _naxalites_ are their own
and not those of 'the people' except by virtue
of the grossly reductionist analysis adopted
by them in the name of Marxism-Leninism.
In devising the strategies and tactics they are
fully conscious of the needs and hopes of
the people, but can be dogmatically uncaring
and ruthless to the point of coming close to
'using' the people. Most of their decisions
are taken and implemented over the heads
of the people, but are justified in the name
of the people with the theoretical argument
that they represent the most class-conscious
_vanguard_ of the masses, and therefore are
as a matter of theory entitled to speak on
their behalf even _if_ the actual masses have
little say in the matter.

The _naxalites_' fight against the landlords
and the state is not just for the immediate
direct benefit of the masses (that would be
called _economism_) but also for the capture
of political power, which is described as
_workers and peasants power_ and is theorised
as the scientific framework for the realisation
of all egalitarian aspirations. That may be
so and it may not be so, but whether or not
the masses are greatly moved by this promise
and this theory, they must put up with the
consequences of the decisions taken and the
acts perpetrated in the name of their own
empowerment --- like it or not. And the violence,
the fear and the terror that the _naxalites_
employ is not aimed only at the rich and the
evil but at all those (of whichever social
class) designated enemies of the movement
by the movement. This subjectivity in
deciding who are the 'enemies of the people'
allows for the degree of arbitrariness that is
necessary to make terror an efficacious
instrument, if one can at all accept it as a
legitimate instrument, for terror not
accompanied by some degree of arbitrariness
is no terror at all --- a fact that intellectuals who
defend terror in the name of high ideals are
too shame-faced to admit. The most visible
sign of this _effect_ is the curtain of fear that
soon descends over society at large, and
affects even those sections of the poor who
are not supporters of the _naxalites_.

All this makes for a much more complex
picture than either the communist
revolutionaries or the police would like to
admit. The author of what is happening in
Telangana is neither 'the people' nor
'terrorism' but a particular political agent
which has a complex relation with the people
and their very real aspirations, and uses
terror among other instruments as a means.

Aravinda Rao has of course read enough
of the literature on terrorism to know that
the kind of naming he indulges in is not
unproblematic. He knows well the adage
 --- usually quoted in the very first page of books
on terrorism --- that one person's terrorist is
another's '_mujahid_' This is not an excuse
for justifying all the terror indulged in the
name of liberation in Telangana or elsewhere.
But the recognition of a basic problem in
understanding and coming to terms with
political terror: that it is politics as much as
it is terror, and therefore has a base in genuine
human aspirations, represents it genuinely
to some extent or other, even if it is not the
sole or highest representative as it usually
claims, for no necessarily greater reason
than that it has more effective weapon power
than the others. But Aravinda Rao gets around
this difficulty by a simple means: there are
and there may well be situations that call for
revolution or violent liberation, but there is
no such situation in India. He is not just
saying that there is no evidence that the poor
people of the Telangana districts are all or
in a majority convinced that for the betterment
of their lives they should be prepared for a
violent overthrow of the present social order
and the establishment of what the Maoists
call a _new democratic order_. That would be
a serious criticism of the _naxalites_ and their
claims. He is saying that there is no space
at all for any violent revolution in India and
there is no question of the people ever wanting
it because India is a 'democracy' which
responds to people's problems and
aspirations. That Indian democracy is genuine
enough to some degree will be acknowledged,
but the burden of proving that the degree
is such as is claimed by Aravinda Rao should
in fact be upon him and people in power like
him, for the lack of such a degree of accountability
and responsiveness has been a very
basic charge of responsible critics, who have
identified it as one of the main causes of
political militancy and terror in different
parts of the country. Aravinda Rao on the
other hand merely declares blandly that it
is so and therefore concludes that there can be
no reason for any violent revolution in India.

This attitude forecloses the one genuine
question that could fruitfully occupy anyone
who like Aravinda Rao advocates the
protection _of_ the Indian polity against the
violence of the _naxalites_: how to make the
Indian state accountable to the people, and
to democratic principles, to the degree
necessary to rebut the arguments of the
_naxalites_, that is to say how to make it
sufficiently democratic to create a popular
climate against violent options. Such an
analysis would have been much more useful
than this polemic that presupposes a non-existent
answer to that dilemma and indulges
in ridicule of the revolutionaries. It could
have aided the cause of progress by helping
to democratise the Indian polity further, just
as the _naxalites_, whatever their faults, have
in their own way served the cause of progress
by helping to improve the livelihood of the
poor and instilling greater self-confidence in
them. But it is perhaps too much to expect
a policeman to really wish to improve the
democratic content of the polity to forestall
violent options, for few policemen really
love democracy, though they never tire of
calling upon it to rebut the arguments of
revolutionaries.

One can imagine an immediate response
to this argument: that it is unrealistic to
demand of the Indian polity that it provide
instant solutions to all problems and instant
gratification of all desires. That is of course
impossible and nobody is asking for any
such thing. Quite balanced and responsible
critics are asking for much less, and even
that is lacking. Of course, for the masters
of the Indian polity, 'balanced and responsible'
critics may be those alone who make
allowance for all the difficulties professed
by the rulers. A different interpretation would
require a sense of balance and responsibility
in the demands of sacrifice that one makes
upon the people in the cause of progress,
Quick solutions are in any case difficult, and
any attempt to justify contemporary acts of
violence and terror by appealing to the very
human craving for a shortcut to happiness
is an irresponsible political attitude, though
one prevalent widely in radical circles. What
one could on the other hand demand with
a sense of responsibility towards the
people is that the polity develop sufficiently
genuine responsiveness to the aspirations of
life, liberty and equality before criticising
the people for supporting or tolerating violent
options. _It_ is a question of creating honest
faith rather than creating instant paradise. It
is not that there is a rational agent called 'the
people' that weighs meticulously the probable
costs of the option of violent change against
the probable cost of waiting for progress,
assuming at all that anybody knows the two
costs. The reasons why human beings are
attracted to violent options are much more
complex than such a model of rational choice
 --- or one of militant class consciousness, for
that matter --- would imply. But nevertheless,
lack of faith in the potential for justice
contained in the present arrangement of things
is a very important impelling factor behind
political violence, or at any rate it is the one
factor which those who are on the side of
the _status quo_ should be prepared to account
for, as a matter of moral responsibility,
whether or not that will automatically rule
out violent options. If they have honestly
accounted for it, then they at least acquire
a moral right to ask the people to give them
a little more time. But not otherwise.

This police officer, instead, denies the
existence of the one problem anyone
 --- bureaucrat or politician --- in power should
answer in reply to the _naxalites_, and thereby
leaves _naxalism_ hanging in a vacuum, bereft
of a rationale and hence a mere concentrate
of irresponsible terror that only 'uses' human
aspirations to further its goal, which is nothing
but itself. Apolitical terror can only have
terror as its goal. Political terror, on the other
hand, can well have a very benign political
goal, whether or not realistic, whether or not
in fact realisable by means of terror. And
to say that human aspirations are only 'used'
is to deny the human dimension of the politics
 --- which is itself denied anyway --- and to
reduce the human beings to mere objects.
That the revolutionaries themselves tend to
sometimes use people, a fact only painfully
in evidence, cannot and should not lead to
the denial of the actuality of the people's
hopes and aspirations and the manifold ways
in which they are linked to the revolutionaries
and their violence, of which being 'used' is
only one dimension.

The book carries the subtitle 'Social and
Legal Issues', but the social and legal are
the two aspects its analysis singularly lacks,
indeed, any true analysis of the _naxalite_
movement would acknowledge that its
greatest achievement is not economic --- that
would have probably come about even
without the _naxalites_, though perhaps more
slowly --- but social: it has hit fatally at the
power relations of rural Telangana society
and has endowed the poor, the _dalits_ and the
tribals with a voice of their own and the
courage to speak out. This development has
already exhibited signs of turning into an
embarrassment for the _naxalites_ themselves
 --- for the social slaves they have liberated
are not all in a mood to accept a new political
master, a fact that would have perhaps
exhibited itself more visibly by now --- if the
master had been less heavily armed --- but
however that may be, the achievement is
something for which the people of Telangana
will forever be grateful to the communist
revolutionaries.

When the political and social dimensions
of terror are denied, what remains is just
violence, cynical and irresponsible violence.
Depicting political terror this way carries a
strategic advantage for the policeman's
argument. It creates legitimate space for
introducing police terror as an excusable or
even necessary thing, whose lawlessness
would otherwise worry the kind of person
who is likely to read a book such as this.
It is alright, the argument implies, to say that
the police should deal lawfully with the
violence based upon genuine social need and
political requirement, but that demand loses
rational and ethical force when it is applied
to illegitimate and whimsical violence. This
is the strategic advantage that Aravinda Rao's
argument gains from the depiction of
_naxalism_ as violence minus political content
and social _raison d'être_. Of course, those
such as human rights activists who have
genuine respect for _rule of law_ would still
say that even such violence must be dealt
with only by lawful means, and the law
should be fair and reasonable, not because
of any fundamentalism of spirit, but because
otherwise the cure would be worse than the
disease, but there are bound to be many in
society who would be willing to accept the
implied suggestion that such qualms amount
to irrational hypersensitivity.

# POLICE LAWLESSNESS

Having crafted his framework to provide
space for appealing to such opinion, Aravinda
Rao can freely argue in favour of condoning
what are usually called 'police excesses'. Of
course, for form's sake he denies the excesses.
He even says that the expression 'state terror'
which not only the revolutionaries but also
human rights activists use, is inappropriate
for a democracy wedded to '_rule of law_' such
as India. It is valid only for totalitarian states.
It is not my case that Indian democracy and
_rule of law_ are entirely fraudulent. They are
not, as a general proposition. But there are
many situations in which the description
fraudulent is quite apt to describe Indian
democracy. The handling of armed militancy
 --- in Kashmir, Nagaland or Telangana --- is
one such situation. Aravinda Rao's statement
that 'the state governments in India have not
created and trained any secret police apparatus
for eliminating the terrorists except by the
process of law' is a laughable falsehood. He
himself heads a force of policemen that is
secret for all practical purposes (for its men
move around with weapons but without
insignia or name plates and do not record
their movements in any diary open to
inspection) and has been created specifically
to eliminate the 'terrorists' classified and
identified by _itself_, not by the process of any
known law but by the lawless norms of
arbitrary power. At another point he says
that the poor policeman who confronts the
_naxalites_ perpetually risks his neck at 'the
altar of the _National Human Rights
Commission_'. The compliment should bring
a blush to the prematurely wrinkled cheeks
of that infant institution! The sad fact is that
the only 'altar' at which the policemen
involved in _anti-naxalite_ operations risk their
necks is the landmines of the _naxalites_
themselves. This is sad for two reasons. One,
that vengeful retaliation of a particularly
brutal kind should be the only justice
perceived to be available against police
violence in a reasonably civilised country
such as ours; and two, because the landmines
pick their victims very indiscriminately: any
policeman travelling in any jeep on any rural
track of Telangana risks his life, quite
irrespective of his own character and conduct.
There have been instances of jeeps of forest,
revenue and election officials being hit by
_naxalite_ landmines due to mistaken identity.

Apart from the _NHRC_, the magisterial
enquiries held under _Section 176_ of _CrPC_
into police excesses are cited by this author
as a real restraint on police lawlessness. The
one is as ridiculous as the other. This is not
meant to show disrespect to lawful procedures
restraining the police, a charge that Aravinda
Rao levels at _civil liberties_ activists. What
the _civil liberties_ groups would like to see
is real and effective restraints and not
ineffective ones put on exhibition for form's
sake. What they seek is not to discredit the
institutions of law and justice to make the
way clear for the revolutionaries, as Aravinda
Rao insinuates, but genuine accountability
of the state machinery to the law and to the
rights of the people. If the magisterial
enquiries did in fact 'act as a check on
possible police excesses' (only possible, and
not real), if in fact 'injured persons and
independent witnesses' did appear before all
such enquiries to make their depositions, if
in fact there were 'several cases in which
the magistrates found fault with the police
for excessive use of force and in those cases
the police have been prosecuted' --- all these
are assertions made by this senior officer of
the Andhra Pradesh police --- _civil liberties_
organisations would be only too happy,
Aravinda Rao knows perfectly well that none
of these statements is true as far as police
excesses _vis-à-vis_ the _naxalite_ movement go.
Even regarding police excesses in other
situations, the most one can say is that
magisterial enquiries to take place, victims
(if they are alive) and the more courageous
among the witnesses (if any) do depose, if
not in all cases, then frequently enough to
allow policemen writing books to cite these
enquiries as instances of their accountability
to the law. Some report is then sent to the
home ministry by the enquiring executive
magistrate, which rarely takes any other than
purely departmental action on erring
policemen, assuming that is that the report
has found fault with policemen, which is not
common since the executive magistrates who
do these enquiries are not judicial officers
but revenue officials whose vocation makes
them nearly as cynical and insensitive as the
policemen whom they work cheek by jowl
with. Prosecutions of police officers are very
very few, and hence punishment in
accordance with law is very very rare. In the
case of police atrocities in _naxalite_ areas, all
that one can say is that magisterial enquiries
are ordered whenever the law requires them
to be. And that is about all that happens.
Witnesses are only rarely allowed to depose.
Policemen are known to wait at the gate of
the enquiring magistrate's office and abduct
intending witnesses. They are known to guard
all the roads leaving the village which is the
scene of the offence and physically stop
people from going to the enquiry. There are
cases where the police have entered the
enquiring magistrate's chamber with
weapons in the hand and brandished them
at the deponents. If, after all this, the enquiry
does find fault with the police for violating
the law, the report is either stored in the home
ministry's archives or rejected and a fresh
enquiry ordered.

Aravinda Rao will probably feel he is
being hit below the belt (for when one
discusses a policeman's book, one is
supposed to refrain politely from referring
to what he does when he is not writing
books) if he and his readers are reminded
that one of the very few cases where the
magisterial enquiry held into an 'encounter'
killing held it to be fake happened in Warangal
district at a time (in 1985) when he was
superintendent of police of that district, and
that he successfully managed to get the report
rejected by the government and a fresh
enquiry ordered after the enquiring executive
magistrate, a sub-collector, was transferred
out of the district at his behest.

Let us return briefly to the _National Human
Rights Commission_, and the respect it is
accorded by the Andhra Pradesh police. The
_Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee_
(_APCLC_) sent a complaint in March 1994
to the _NHRC_ about 'encounter' killings in
the state. This state has been notorious for
that particular form of extra-judicial killing
for nearly three decades now. But the 1990s
have seen an unprecedented escalation in the
magnitude of the killings. More than 60 per
cent of the encounter killings of the three
decades have taken place in the last six years.
_APCLC_ described and tabulated the details
of this ugly phenomenon and sought from
the _NHRC_ nothing more complicated than
a re-statement of the law: an 'encounter' is
a self-confessed act of killing committed
with the full knowledge and intention of the
policemen, and is therefore a crime of murder.
Genuine defence of the body is of course
an extenuating circumstance in law. But that
is to be proved in a court. The mere statement
of the killer that he has killed in self-defence
does not suffice to condone the killing. Hence,
each case of 'encounter' must be registered
as a crime of wilful homicide, investigated
by an agency independent (to the extent
possible) of the police, and tested in a court
of law to decide whether the plea of self-defence
is well taken. This is the plain law,
and it requires no judicial activism to unearth
it. And yet _civil liberties_ organisations have
until recently failed consistently in their effort
to cajole the courts to state this position of
law in so many words.

The AP High Court finally did so in 1995,
and the _NHRC_ in 1996 in response to
_APCLC_'s complaint. This year, the _NHRC_
has directed all state governments to realise
that its direction in the _APCLC_ complaint
applies to 'encounters' everywhere in the
country. But this was preceded by much
mayhem in Andhra Pradesh, which is
pertinent to Aravinda Rao's claim that the
AP police live in perpetual fear of the _NHRC_.
Soon after receiving _APCLC_'s complaint in
March 1994, the _NHRC_ decided to first of
all get a feel of the '_naxalite problem_' in AP.
And so it paid a visit to the state in August
1994 to gather public opinion in the affected
areas, about the _naxalite_ movement and the
government's response to it. They thought
 --- and one cannot complain, for that is what
common sense as well as the judicial-instinct
would recommend --- that the best way to
gather public opinion is to visit the affected
districts and hold open enquiries to which
people would be invited to come and express
their views and grievances. The government
was expected to encourage the people to
attend the sessions and express their views.
It in fact did no such thing. It did not even
give a press release informing the people of
the _NHRC_'s visit. Instead, the police
machinery was geared to exert itself utmost
'to hijack the sittings. This they did with the
ease born of their contempt for anything
judicial. They mobilised large numbers of
victims of _naxalite_ violence (including not
only men of the exploiting classes or others
who may be reasonably described as enemies
of the poor, but also victims of arbitrary and
unreasonable acts of violence by the _naxalites_)
plus paid informers of the police, kith and
kin of policemen slain by the _naxalites_,
professional criminals who live at the behest
of the police and plainclothes policemen
themselves. This crowd thronged the place
of the sittings and created with their shouting
and shoving such an atmosphere of terror
that anyone not friendly with the police felt
deterred from going there. The only exception
was the handful of _civil liberties_ activists
from the complainant organisation and the
few victims of police violence that they had
brought with them. They found themselves
surrounded by a hostile crowd which booed
them with offensive slogans and manhandled
them right in the presence of the dignitaries
of the _NHRC_, as the entire lot of 'superior'
police officers of the district looked on in
ill-disguised glee. This happened on successive
days at Karimnagar, Warangal and Nalgonda.

That is how much 'respect' the Andhra
Pradesh police have for the _NHRC_.

Later the _NHRC_ came back to Andhra
Pradesh to pursue the matter. This time it
came, not to gather public opinion but to
record evidence concerning six selected cases
of 'encounters' from out of the list submitted
by _APCLC_. The police once again did their
best to threaten, cajole or buy off witnesses.
They succeeded fully in one case and partially
in another. In the remaining cases, the kith
and kin of the dead men and other witnesses
did appear before the _NHRC_. braving considerable
police pressure. After hearing the
evidence and the arguments concerning the
question whether the law allows impunity
to the police to torture and kill, the _NHRC_
gave its report in November 1996 telling the
government of Andhra Pradesh in quite plain
language that an 'encounter' is an act of culpable
homicide which must be registered as
a crime, investigated by an agency as independent
as possible of the local police force, the
report of which is to be placed before a court
that is to judge whether the killing in fact
took place in self-defence. This was, as said
above, in November 1996. As this review
is written, about 70 persons have been killed
in 'encounters' by the Andhra Pradesh police
since the publication of the _NHRC_'s report
but in not a single case have the police
superiors --- and that includes the author of
this book --- of Andhra Pradesh directed their
subordinates to act in accordance with the
directions of the _NHRC_, and they evidently
have no qualms about not doing so.

That, once again, is how much the Andhra
Pradesh police respect the _NHRC_, and how
much in awe they stand of its powers.

But one need not belabour the point too
much. Nowhere in the world do policemen
like the idea that they too are accountable
to the law. That, they believe, is like telling
god that he too is bound by the Holy Book
that he has pronounced to keep mortals in
check. It would not have mattered what
individual policemen --- or an entire police
force, for that matter --- thought, but for the
fact that this attitude is a sanctioned part of
the notion of sovereignty of the state. The
rhetoric of democracy says that the people
are the true Sovereigns, but while in
democracies the people do have some degree
of control over the political masters, the state
as a whole is as yet very reluctant, and more
so in Third World countries, to allow itself
to be held accountable to the people, or even
to the law, which is a partial mode of
accountability to the people.

Aravinda Rao points to the enquiries held
by the executive magistrates and the
directions and recommendations of the
_NHRC_ as the two checks upon police
misbehaviour provided by the system (the
implication being that there is no need to
make any further noise about police
atrocities), but apart from the contempt with
which the police habitually treat these
institutions and their proceedings, it must be
recognised that neither of them has the power
to pronounce judicially on anybody's guilt
and award mandatory punishment. As a police
officer, Aravinda Rao would certainly not
countenance the suggestion that all criminals
should have this facility of being held
accountable to the law only through the
mechanism of an executive magistrate's
enquiry which ends in nothing more harmful
than a report that is never acted upon, and
a direction by the _NHRC_ which amounts to
nothing more serious than an admonition.
Policemen, of course, will not find this
comparison amusing. Not just policemen,
the sovereign as such does not like to be
equated with common mortals, however
democratic it may claim to be. But since
human beings will always require some
policing --- the state is never going to wither
away --- it remains a problem of civilisation
to make its police swallow the idea that they
play their nasty role within the strict limits
of the norms set by society. The most
important norm, of course, is that the role
of the police in society will be severely
limited and circumscribed within the
narrowest limits necessary. Today,
unfortunately, it is expanding to fill the
vacuum left by decaying political institutions
and diminishing social responsibility. What
is happening in Telangana is only an instance
of this general disease.

# _CIVIL LIBERTIES_ MOVEMENT

Finally, a word or two about Aravinda
Rao's treatment of the _civil liberties_
movement, in particular his _bête noire_, the
_Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee_.
A writer who wishes to be taken seriously
must beware of bad blood, for it makes for
a poor critique. Aravinda Rao's account of
_APCLC_ is an example. He is willing to
concede some virtues, however reluctantly,
to the _naxalite_ movement, but to the _civil
liberties_ movement, none. He does not
concede even the minimal virtues of reason
and common sense. It is of course true that
the _civil liberties_ movement was initially a
creature of the _CPI(ML)_. Whether or not the
first generation office-bearers were actually
members of the _CPI(ML)_, they were very
much part of its ethos and political discipline.
It is also true that the various _CPI(ML)_
groups in Andhra Pradesh would still like
it to be that way, and therefore motivate their
sympathisers, and intellectuals amenable to
their way of thinking and their discipline,
to join the _APCLC_, so that the organisation
may better serve their needs. What Aravinda
Rao knows but does not wish to acknowledge
is that right in the midst of this pressure
 --- and of course the very brutal pressure excited
by the police --- of which Aravinda Rao knows
quite well, for he was the superintendent of
police of Warangal district when the first
killing by the police of an _APCLC_ activist,
the elderly pediatrician A Ramanadham, took
place in that town --- _APCLC_ has carved for
itself a unique identity and a wide-ranging
agenda. It is not a question of moderates _vs_
extremists _vis-à-vis_ _naxalite_ violence, as he
says at one point. That makes it seem as if
the worry is only about the quantum of
violence the _civil liberties_ movement may
uncritically countenance on the part of rebel
movements. It is rather whether movements
which arise from the injustices of society and
speak and act in the name of justice shall
themselves be allowed to behave unjustly
and get away without any censure from the
human rights movement. But more than this,
the debate and the differences within the
human rights movement pertain to recognising
--- or denying --- a specific role for the
movement within each sphere of social
iniquity, struggle and transformation, a role
that is not merely supportive of "people's
struggles" but has an agenda of its own, an
agenda of furtherance of democratic norms
and values in social relations and institutions.

To make the _civil liberties_ movement look
ridiculous he says that mere arrest and
interrogation of a _naxalite_ is denounced _state
terror_ by the _civil liberties_ movement. That
is not true, and he knows it to be not true.
Notwithstanding pressure from the
revolutionaries and their ideologues that the
crimes of violence committed by them are
not crimes but acts of liberation, the _civil
liberties_ movement has taken the stand that
it will not oppose the law taking its course
in the matter of revolutionary violence, for
that is part of the _rule of law_. What we have
opposed is extra-legal suppression of the
_naxalites_ or anybody for that matter; the
enactment of statutes such as _TADA_ which
cannot be called law at all it that expression
includes respect for natural justice and civic
freedoms; and the refusal to recognise that
behind the violence is a politics with its
specific social base and _raison d'être_.

Aravinda Rao knowingly makes the false
allegation that torture of ordinary criminal
suspects does not evoke the kind of response
that torture _of_ the radical activist does. On
the contrary, it is the _civil liberties_ movement
that first drew the attention of social concern
to custodial deaths in which it is mostly nonpolitical
crime suspects that die. If today in
Andhra Pradesh and some other states even
otherwise insensitive political parties have
learnt to react to custodial deaths, and if the
courts and _NHRC_ are responding positively
to complaints of custodial torture and killing,
the credit goes to the _civil liberties_ movement.
I may recall an incident of nearly a decade
ago that is likely to again embarrass Aravinda
Rao. One can of course comprehend the
embarrassment, unless one is of the Utopian
persuasion that policing as such (and not the
degree and kind of policing) is an artificial
creature of human pre-history, which is bound
to vanish once the epoch of true human
history begins. Policemen habitually
complain that society leaves them the most
nasty job of dealing with explicit expressions
of the evil in the human potential, and repays
by preaching morality at them for their alleged
insensitivity in doing the job that the rest
of society is not prepared to do. One can
sympathise with this complaint, but only
when it comes from policemen who restrain
themselves to act within the norms set by
civilisation for handling human evil by means
of force rather than persuasion, and tell society
honestly that this is all the police can do,
and the rest is society's civilisational burden.
But not when it comes from those who
regard the civilisational restraints on policing
with contempt and enjoy the power that
flows from their regular violation.

Aravinda Rao was, at the juncture of the
incident, the SP of Cuddapah district of the
Rayalaseema region. He took personal
initiative in apprehending and interrogating
a professional housebreaker by name
Venkateshwarlu of Badvel. The man was
detained for more than 50 days in a series
of police stations on either side of the
Cuddapah and Prakasam districts and tortured
to confess to a number of robberies and
thefts, and to reveal the names of the persons
the stolen goods were sold to. All the while
the wife and infant daughter of the man were
also - totally without the sanction of law
detained in the various police stations. The
child contracted infection in course of this
ill-treatment and died of diarrhoea almost at
the time the police succeeded in 'cracking'
the series of 'thefts and robberies' the child's
father had committed. Both the 'success' of
the investigation (publicised by the SP) and
the death of the child (publicised by _APCLC_)
received prominent attention from the press.
Aravinda Rao's furious reaction (as stated
to press reporters) was to call _civil liberties_
activists 'birds of prey that are perpetually
in search of corpses'. Today he says they
are interested only in the corpses of _naxalites_.

What, in the end, is this policeman's
prescription tor curing what he regards as
the _naxalite_ disease? Since he believes that
there is no real reason for its existence he
probably expects that it will eventually fade
out. There is no evil in hoping so. But in
actual practice, the state is not waiting for
the alleged irrelevance of _naxalism_ to drive
it out. The state and its police are committing
more and more gruesome acts to eliminate
the _naxalites_ and are doing so as a matter
of deliberate political policy. The quantum
of injury they are causing in the process to
the people as well as to democratic civilisation
is incalculable. But they will not succeed
 --- at least not easily. It does not matter whether
the new democratic revolution of the _naxalites_
is relevant or irrelevant as a prescription for
our ills. Notwithstanding that, there is space
in our polity for an effective popular counterweight
to the unresponsive and unheeding
executive and the very inadequate
mechanisms of adjudication, that respond if
at all on the side of the rich and the powerful
and against the poor. That is the main role
the _naxalites_ are playing today, and though
it has nothing much to do with their theory
of agrarian struggle as the axis of the
revolution, it can well sustain itself, even if
it will probably find it difficult to move out
of the undeveloped areas of the state. Of
course, the fact that the _naxalite_ counterweight
functions on behalf of the poor and
the oppressed as against the rich and the
powerful does not mean that it is without
risk or harm to those classes. Firstly, as a
parallel adjudicatory and executive
mechanism, the revolutionaries adjudicate
matters not only between the oppressed and
the oppressors but also between different
sections of the oppressed or the middle
classes. And their procedures and their norms
being determined by whatever political
consciousness the local activists possess plus
raw weapon power, their administration of
justice and their executive directives are
sometimes more harsh and brutal than those
of bourgeois law, apart from being amenable
or liable to the common ills of power --- any
power. Secondly, it is a notorious truth about
armed political militancy that it is perpetually
involved in the brutal act of weeding out
agents of its enemy within its social base,
to such an extent that it soon is found killing
more of its own people than the enemy.
Kashmiri militants have killed more Kashmiri
Muslims than either Hindus or the officers
_of_ the union of India; the same is true of
Khalistani militants who have killed more
of the Sikh 'agents' or 'informers' of the
union of India than their systemic enemies.
The _naxalites_, similarly, have killed more of
the poor and the rural middle classes than
the landlords, the other exploiters or the
police. This is a very unpleasant fact about
political terror which its practitioners and
sympathisers are hard put to defend, except
to point --- for the benefit of whoever is
willing to find that a satisfactory reply --- to
the promise of what the people will attain
after liberation.

But notwithstanding all this, the _naxalites_
do fill the space that really exists in Indian
society and democracy for a popular and
effective counter-weight to the force of the
state's bureaucracy and the police, and the
social power of the dominant classes. No
amount of curses delivered by Aravinda Rao
is going to drive out this gap and the force
that fills it. Genuine democratisation and
reform may do it, but nobody is thinking of
it, and instead our rulers arc opting for the
dictates of international capital which only
make things much worse. Let us remind ourselves
that the might of the police forces of
Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the central paramilitary
are finding it impossible to apprehend
the single brigand called Veerappan who
seems to have created some kind of a popular
base for himself by appealing to ties of community
and providing some employment
and income to forest dwellers around. The
reason is not that our police are all that inefficient,
nor only that whether it is Veerappan
or _naxalites_ their terror is no mean thing for
the people in whose midst they live, a factor
which the state makes much of.

More than all these factors is the simple
truth that very few people in this country
have much love and affection for the '_sarkar_'.
at any rate not enough to help it to apprehend
any and all challengers of its monopoly of
law and force, especially if the challenger,
out of cleverness (as in the case of Veerappan)
or political principle and social sympathy (as
in the case of _naxalites_), keeps his force on
the right side of the masses.

The conclusion a reasonable person would
draw from this is that what we have here
is a situation that the police and the armed
forces cannot handle. That it can, if at all,
be handled only politically, or even better,
by reasoned societal interaction with the
parallel sovereign and its aspiration to replace
the actual sovereign. The role of the police
should be strictly confined to the control
and investigation of crimes. Those who are
political sympathisers of the _naxalites_ need
not put themselves outside this process
of interaction, for they too presumably
realise that social transformation is not
unproblematic and needs a helping hand
from all concerned to keep it on the proper
track.

But instead, Aravinda Rao and his ilk ask
for more powers to the police. He makes at
one point a very curious argument for condoning
police lawlessness, or vigilantism as he
calls it. The word vigilantism has shades of
meaning, both positive and negative, but this
author uses it in a positive sense. Judges, he
says, go beyond the law to advance the law
and that is allowed and respected by society
in the name of judicial activism. Vigilantism,
then, is the act of police going beyond the
law to enforce the law, and why does not
society respect it? I do not know whether
this Andhra police officer is the originator
of this novelty or it has its origin in the
intellectual output of the international
fraternity of policemen. The trick lies in
saying only that both judges and policemen
go 'beyond the law' without adding that the
one expands rights when it does so (though
we seem to be in for some reverse judicial
activism in the coming days) and the other
violates rights in doing so.

Apart from this, the only other 'legal issue'
raised by this author is the lamented demise
of _TADA_. He wants it back with the same
powers and less ambiguity in its definitions.
He will probably have his wish once the
political instability at Delhi goes. There is
no need now to go into the reasons for
opposing that non-existent statute, and
whether they are all born of ignorance as
Aravinda Rao seems to think, but it is
necessary to answer the comparison he draws
with western democracies and the greater
powers they allow the police in general, or
in dealing with terrorism. Apart from the
question whether such powers should be
allowed, anywhere and at any time, it must
be remarked that the police force in those
countries is more amenable to self-discipline
and discipline of the law than is ours by any
stretch of imagination. The common
rhetorical comparison of the Indian police
with a licensed gang of ruffians may not
reflect the whole truth, for policemen perform
quite a few difficult and necessary duties,
but in matters of amenability to lawful control
and discipline the comparison is very apt.
They are as unruly as a gang of ruffians, with
the added disadvantage of being consecrated
by the law to discipline others. To trust such
a force with more powers than at present,
in the name of what is given in Britain or
Sweden would be suicidal for India,
irrespective of whether it is right in those
countries. If Aravinda Rao knows nothing
else, he should know at least one thing, that
whether it is in Telangana or Punjab or.
Kashmir, not everybody may love the
militants, but everybody without exception
hates the police and the armed forces. Such
is the character of policing in India, and
nobody other than a policeman would argue
that the Indian police deserve more powers,
or that such a conferment of additional powers
would solve any problem whatsoever.
