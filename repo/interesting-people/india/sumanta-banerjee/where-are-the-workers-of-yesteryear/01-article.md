# PART I

The death centenary of the "greatest
living thinker who ceased to think"
100 years ago is being observed probably
with more fanfare than was
evident during his birth centenary
celebrations. Incidentally, the 100th
birth anniversary of Karl Marx happened
to fall within six months of the
triumph of the _Russian revolution_ and
the establishment of the first full-fledged
'_dictatorship of the proletariat_'
--- the dream nursed by Marx all
through his life.

The role of the _proletariat_ in bringing
about the transformation from
capitalism to socialism lay at the heart
of Marx's theory of social change. It
was during Marx's life-time and the
first decade of the 20th century that
the working class in Europe appeared
to develop into what promised to be
the agent for carrying out the historic
mission which Marx ascribed to it. The
glorious record of the struggle of the
_European proletariat_ --- the _Luddite
rebellion_ fraught with all the fears and
terrors and stammerings that are associated
with a period of gestation; the
_Chartist movement_ marking a step forward
in the political organisation of
the workers; the series of battles in
the streets of Paris culminating in the
_Great Commune_, the 'festival of the
oppressed'?; and the reaching of the
zenith in the thunderclap of November
1917 in Russia --- can never be
played back. If one asks today: where
are the descendants of Ned Ludd, or
the Irishman Feargus O'Connor of
Chartist fame, the iron-worker
Emile Duval who was shot when taken
prisoner during the Commune, or the
workers of Petrograd, we can only echo
the 15th century French poet Francois
Villon's famous refrain: "But where are
the snows of yesteryear?"

## A THOUSAND STREAMS

Like last year's snows, the _proletariat_,
once assumed to be the most
solidly organised and disciplined to be
able to head the revolution, have melted
and diffused into a thousand different
screams flowing in various directions.
With changes in historical seasons, the
old political landmarks disappear giving
way to new ones. In Marx's time, the
main nucleus of the _proletariat_ was to
be found in the industrial centres of
Europe and America. Today, the
nucleus in the West is fragmented ---
some sections still impoverished as in
Marx's days, some upgraded through
economic concessions, some displaced
by technological changes and some
co-opted into the latest computerised
production processes. In the Third
World on the other hand, the _proletariat_
takes different forms --- pre-capitalist
artisans and craftsmen struggling desperately
to fight the inroads of modern
industry into their traditional working
situations; migrants from rural areas
working in factories and yet retaining
strong feudal roots in their villages;
highly skilled industrial workers aspiring
to --- and often succeeding in ---
entry into the socio-economic environment
of the _pretty bourgeoisie_. Do they
all have the same interests? Are they
all driven by the common urge that
made Marx declare: "Working men of
all countries, unite!"? Have they lost
all their stakes in their respective societies
to echo Marx: "The proletarians
have nothing to lose but their chains?"

Marx's friend and collaborator Engels
once said: "The irony of world history
turns everything upside down."
(Introduction to Marx's "_Class Struggles
in France_", 1895.) But this is as
it should be. Marx himself while paying
due respects to past revolutions,
refused to accept their heroes as leaders
of the new revolution. "The social
revolution of the nineteenth century."
he wrote in the 'Eighteenth Brumaire':
"cannot draw its poetry from the past,
but only from the future." But while
the main agent selected by Marx for
the socialist revolution stands changed
today at the end of the 20th century,
shedding many of the characteristics
attributed to it by Marx more than
100 years ago. Marx's orthodox disciples
have not changed. Like a faithful
lover endowing the indifferent beloved
with qualities he or she no longer retains,
they continue to overlook the
many-sided, ever-changing reality that
looms behind the private vision they
are nursing --- the idealised image of
an _ideal proletariat_ fixed in the party
mentality as a constant element. Whatever
differences might divide Moscow
from Beijing, or the Eurocommunists
from Albania, or the numerous Communist
parties and groups in India,
they are unanimous in refusing to
challenge the sacrosanct position assigned
to the _proletariat_ as the harbinger
of a revolutionary transformation. They
eschew the possibility of a gulf between
the traditional Marxist premise
("The advance of industry, whose involuntary
promoter is the _bourgeoisie_,
replaces the isolation of the labourers,
due to competition, by their revolutionary
combination, due to association
... What the _bourgeoisie_, therefore,
produces above all, is its own
gravediggers." --- _Communist Manifesto_)
and the perception of the _proletariat_
(their revolutionary urge blunted
by economic palliatives and soothed by
the lures of a consumerist society, their
personality dehumanised by mechanised
production processes, and their organisational
strength diffused through the
scattering of work places due to the
introduction of automation in Western
industries). How do the _proletariat_ perceive
the modern state? If the limited
aims --- constantly reinforced into their
consciousness by the spokesmen of the
_bourgeois_ state as well as their trade
union leaders --- of higher wages, fixed
working hours, better living conditions
can be achieved to some extent within
the framework of existing society,
through institutionalised practices like
_collective bargaining_ or strikes, why
should they be interested in Overthrowing
the state?

## DICTATORSHIP OF PASSIVITY

It seems that the path of advance
in _proletariat organisation_ has faithfully
followed its course as outlined by
Marx. But the destination has shifted
further and further away from the goal
of _dictatorship of the proletariat_ to
that of _dictatorship of passivity_. Marx
held that faced hy fluctuating wages
and precarious livelihood, workers
would combine into trade unions, and
later into political parties, and compel
legislative recognition of their particular
interests like higher wages or
fixed working hours. Developing from
collision between individual workmen
and _individual bourgeois_ employers into
conflicts between two distinct classes,
the class struggle would break out
into open revolution "where the violent
overthrow of the _bourgeoisie_ lays
the foundation for the sway of the
_proletariat_". But the _bourgeoisie_, better
organised and more experienced
than the _proletariat_, learnt their lessons
from Marx faster than the Marxists.
Some might blame the 'reformists' for
curbing the 'revolutionary vigour' of
the working class and encouraging them
to accept the crumbs distributed by
the _bourgeoisie_. Others might blame
the 'ultra-Leftists' for pushing the
workers into an untimely fight with the
_bourgeoisie_ and bringing about their
defeat. But both forget that the class
struggle within a capitalist system is
an unequal fight, with the ruling class
always enjoying a certain edge over the
exploited class. While allowing class
struggle to develop to a certain point,
the _bourgeoisie_ knew how to prevent
it from reaching the qualitative stage
of a revolutionary outbreak by intervening
at the decisive moment either
by overcoming contradictions among
themselves (contradictions by which
Marx set much store) and concentrating
the repressive force against the
workers, or by buying time through
economic concessions that neutralised
the advanced section of the working
class. By a curious irony, the very
organised strength of the working class
which Marx held to be the main weapon
for a revolutionary change, on
certain occasions became a catalyst by
winning immediate economic benefits
and bringing about thereby a cultural
mutation of the character of the _proletariat_.
On other occasions, the workers'
organised strength itself became dispersed,
the increasing bureaucratisation
and automation of the capitalist economy
helping to split the workers more
and more into distinct strata.

The attempt by Marxists to fit this
elusive class into the straitjacket of the
leader of a revolution, reflects in a
sense what Marx would have called a
_false consciousness_. Although the hypothesis
that the _proletariat_ is the only
class to lead the revolution has been
falsified empirically more than once,
like a superstitious gambler the Communist
parties still invoke the spirit of
'_the proletariat_' even when in practice
they choose the _non-proletariat_ as
leaders. If the _proletariat_ is not prepared
to heed the call, or is just not
available (as in the vast countryside of
the Third World), '_proletarian consciousness_'
which can be cultivated by
any class apparently, is good enough,
enabling the Communist parties to
embalm Marx's prophecy about the
leadership of the _proletariat_ in a theoretical
prophylactic.

While Marx insisted : "The emancipation
of the working class must be
the work of the working class itself"
("_First Premise of the Rules of the
First International_", 1864), Lenin found
on the eve of the seizure of power a
passive Russian working class. Referring
to "the inadequate numerical
strength of the _proletariat_ in Russia
and its insufficient _class-consciousness_
and organisation", he complained: "A
gigantic _petty-bourgeois_ wave has swept
over everything and overwhelmed the
_class-conscious proletariat_, not only by
force of numbers but also ideologically;
that is, it has infected and imbued
very wide circles of workers with the
_petty-bourgeois_ political outlook"
("_The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our
Revolution_", September 1917). As a
result, it had to be the soldiers (who
mainly came from a rural background,
and functioning in a different work
situation, could not be strictly called
_proletariat_ in the original Marxist
sense) along with a minority of the
_proletariat_ (of Petrograd) who had to
spearhead the revolution.

But while it was possible for Lenin
and the Bolsheviks to establish a
tangible connection with the _industrial
proletariat_ (the number of workers
increased from 14,000 out of a total
party membership of 24,000 in 1917
to 300,000 out of a total of 732,000),
in China such an organic link, or a
direct physical presence of the workers
in the leadership was largely precluded
by a revolutionary strategy which had
to depend on the peasantry as the
crucial force in the agrarian revolution.
Yet, while acting as nonconformist
in practice (departing from
the orthodox Marxist strategy of city-based
insurrections to capture power),
Mao could not shake off the magical
belief in the omnipotence of the
_invisible proletariat_, and maintained
that the Chinese revolution was
"waged by the broad masses of the
people under the leadership of the
_proletariat_" ("_On the Question of the
National Bourgeoisie and the Enlightened
Gentry_", March 1, 1948). When
Mao speaks of the leadership of the
revolution, the _proletariat_ and the
Communist Party often become synonymous
and interchangeable terms,
Thus:

>... in an era when the _proletariat_
has already appeared on the
political stage, the responsibility for
leading China's revolutionary War
inevitably falls on the shoulders of the
Chinese Communist party ... Of all the
social strata and political groupings in
semi-colonial China, the _proletariat_ and
the Communist Party are the ones
most free from narrow-mindedness
and selfishness, are politically the
most far-sighted, the best organised ...
("_Strategy in China's Revolutionary
War_", December 1936)
 
It seems that
the Communist Party in itself embodies
what might be called the _spiritual
essence_ of the _proletariat_ --- an essence
no longer dependent in any way on
the social composition of the party
(even in 1957, the Chinese party could
claim no more than 14 per cent of its
membership as workers), or on any
connection with the _proletariat_. The
_proletarian_ nature of the party need
not reside primarily in the industrial
workers, but the party can internalise
the nature, the universal qualities
which Marx attributed to the workers,
into every party member.

Yet, even in countries where the
_proletariat_ was numerically small and
politically backward, no revolutionary
party could do without it. Being at
the levers of economic power, manning
strategic sectors of the capitalist
society like railways, communication,
power supply, the _proletariat_ kept
society going. If they could be
persuaded to strike, the entire
capitalist economy would collapse ---
paving the way for a revolutionary
seizure of power.

## WHY THE _PROLETARIAT_?

Let us look back for a moment and
try to seek answers to a few questions.
What made Marx choose the _proletariat_
as the agent for the social
change? How far did a simplistic
sense of certainty about their role, in
Marx's writings, lead to the fixation on
the illusion of the _ideal proletariat_
among his followers? Can the deeper
and larger philosophical approach of
Marx (beyond the limited framework
of his socio-economic analysis of
contemporary capitalist society) which
lay at the basis of his espousal of the
cause of the _proletariat_, recharge today
the stagnant battery of the "locomotive
of history"?

In choosing the _proletariat_, Marx
was driven primarily by two motivations
--- one drawn from the immediate
economic and political environment of
contemporary Europe, and the other
from the more abiding philosophical
concept of '_alienation_'.

In the conceptual expression of the
first, Marx was eager to discover laws
by which to explain and predict political
and historical facts, and codify
them in terms of comprehensive
formalism. As result, unwittingly
perhaps, Marx often ignored the
empirical evidence of future possible
deviations that did not fit the conceptual
framework with which he at the
moment happened to be working.
Within this framework, while trying to
formalise the _proletariat_ into a category,
Marx overlooked some of the
prevailing tendencies that in future
became decisive in bringing about the
mutation of the revolutionary character
of the working class.

Marx was quite precise in his definition
of the _proletariat_. To him, the
_proletariat_ were the wage-workers,
peculiar to capitalist relations of production,
who produced surplus value in
the process of commodity production
in the factories. While designating
them as the leaders of the revolution,
Marx put stress on the actual nature
of their physical labour --- their working
with machines in factories ---
which was to shape their character in
the direction of an organised and
highly disciplined 'industrial army'.
Their working conditions --- collective
character of production in a single
place ("The dispersion of the rural
labourers over larger areas breaks
their power of resistance while concentration
increases that of the town
operatives", "_Capital_", _Volume 1, Part
IV_) --- were to teach them to undertake
united actions not only within a
country, but in solidarity with workers
outside labouring in similar situations.

Finally, this class of workers was
different from other poor sections of
the population, as it was the only one
to possess no means of production. As
a result, unlike other classes, the _proletariat_
were not supposed to "fortify
their already acquired status" in existing
society. Bereft of any past attachment
to and future desire for private
property, they were singularly suited
for destroying "all previous securities
for, and insurances of, individual property"
thus bringing about not only
their own emancipation, but that of
the entire human society at the expense
of which till now the propertied
Classes had thrived.

From a strictly historical materialistic
point of view, Marx's stress both on
the specific nature of the class of producers,
and the physical aspect of their
work (their handling of machines having
direct effects on their imagination),
eschews the possibility of either their
replacement by the _non-proletariat_ as
leaders of the revolution, or the cultivation
of '_proletarian consciousness_' by
those not engaged in a similar nature
of production. If being determines consciousness,
how can _proletarian consciousness_
be imbibed by those not physically
involved in factory production?
Even if one can get around this by
suggesting that a few intellectuals, like
Marx or Lenin for instance, can acquire
such consciousness by contemplation,
the question remains : can they develop
the capacity to make the revolution,
divorced as they are from the
production process which alone creates
the capacity (if we are to follow Marx)?
According to the classical Marxist formula,
neither the army, nor the peasantry,
nor the party for that matter
can lay claim to the leadership of a
social revolution in the name of the
_proletariat_, Marx was clear in his attitude
when he reiterated till the end
of his life:

>When the International
was formed, we expressly formulated
the battle cry: The emancipation of
the working class must be the work of
the working class itself. We cannot
therefore, co-operate with people who
openly state that the workers are too
uneducated to emancipate themselves
and must first be freed from above by
_philanthropic bourgeois_ and _petty
bourgeois_ --- Marx and Engels, _Letter
to Bebel, Liebknecht, Bracke and
Others_" September 17, 1879.

But, even when he was alive, Marx
had to face the problem of the _proletariat_
refusing to live upto his expectations.
Referring to the unreliability
of the workers and their vulnerability
to temporary economic concessions,
Engels was to write to Bernstein, two
years before the death of Marx:

>A
drowning man grasps at every straw
and cannot wait for the rescuing boat
to cast off from shore. The boat is the
socialist revolution; the straw is the
protective tariff and (Bismarkian) state
socialism (November 30. 1881)

The
stubborn reality was showing that mere
working conditions in factories need
not produce the particular kind of consciousness,
or capacity, anticipated by
Marx, Though the life pattern of the
_proletariat_, the logic of capitalist development
should have pointed towards
a new order, the conscious activity of
the _proletariat_ was shaped within the
old order and aimed at accommodations
a secure job, however debasing it
might have been, but still ensuring two
meals a day, a home, a few amenities,
etc. --- concessions granted by the ruling
powers which could set back the
development of a revolutionary class
consciousness that was meant to overthrow
the prevailing regime.

## CLASS _IN_ ITSELF _VERSUS_ CLASS _FOR_ ITSELF

There were two ways of overcoming
the problem --- one at the ideological
level, by evolving the abstract concept
of the _proletariat_, unifying all the revolutionary
drives that were expected
to logically follow from capitalist production,
and from which the _individual
proletariat_ might actually deviate in
real life. This abstract image was formulated
years ago when in 1844 in
their first joint work, Marx and Engels
stated:

>The question is not what
this or that proletarian, or even the
whole of the _proletariat_ at the moment
considers as its aim. The question
is what the _proletariat_ is, and what.
consequent on that being, it will be
compelled to do ("_The Holy Family_").

The other was at the operative level,
by the founding of the _International
Workingmen's Association_ in 1864 to
bring awareness to the working class
and theoretical comprehension of what
it must do and the experience through
which it must pass, in other words to
make the _proletariat_ _class-conscious_.
In this respect, Marx was prepared to
wait for "fifteen, twenty, twenty-five
years of civil wars, and wars between
nations not only to change existing
conditions but to change the _proletariat_
and make themselves worthy of political
power" ("_Speech to the Central
Committee of the Communist League_",
September 15, 1850). It was thus expected
that not through work alone,
but through the intervention of extraneous
factors like wars or theoretical
education, the _proletariat_ would
acquire the necessary class characteristics,
and these increasingly would take
precedence over mere individual reactions,
changing the workers from a
class _in_ itself to a class _for_ itself.

The _proletariat_ in Marx's conception
thus became an anomaly, like a bird
that cannot fly. Endowed with what
Marx was sure were wings --- the organisational
strength and discipline
brought about by their nature of work
to carry out the revolution --- the _proletariat_
still had to be taught to fly according
to a set of rules. But while
we can discover rules in the natural
functioning of beings, the latter do not
have to learn those rules to function.
Instead, they know them instinctively,
tacitly, in the same way that people
know how to maintain their balance
while running. The performance deteriorates
when an attempt is made to
apply explicit rules consciously.

One might ask whether the rules
which Marx formulated for the behaviour
of the _proletariat_ were born from
the total pathetic experience of those
who endured the situation, or from the
detached brain that analysed it? Could
One venture to suggest that Marx's
prescience about the course along
which capitalism would develop, was
possible to a large extent due to his
fruitful collaboration with Engels, who
working as a business agent in the
Manchester office of his father's industrial
enterprise and thereby from his
inherent class position, acquired an
intimate, bred-in-the-bone sort of
knowledge about the workings of the
capitalist system? A similar, personal
kind of knowledge based on shared
experiences of the working class, a
deep understanding of the psychology
of the _proletariat_ (which can never be
gained from personal observations, however
sincere and well-meaning they
might be, by outsiders) were lacking
in the case of both Marx and Engels.
(The stress put by later Communist
revolutionaries on the intellectual's
need to be de-classed, and by Mao on
actual participation in physical labour,
assumes importance in this context.)
Could this be the reason why Marx's
prediction about the course of capitalist
development --- increased mechanisation,
wide-scale socialisation of
production, gradual transformation of
the great establishments of production
into joint stock companies, trusts and
then state property --- had more or
less corresponded to the reality, while
that about the _proletariat revolution_
had largely remained unfulfilled?

## THE BETRAYAL

By 1883, when Marx died, it seemed
that he had been betrayed by those
whom he held nearest to his heart
--- the _industrial proletariat_. In West
European countries where capitalism
was advanced and the labour movement
well-established, the _proletariat_
were switching over from insurrectionary
methods recommended for
them by Marx, to the hitherto despised
franchise, to win reforms. Engels
writing his introduction to a new edition
of his friend's book "_The Class
Struggles in France_" in 1895, had to
acknowledge : "We, the 'revolutionists',
the 'overthrowers' --- we are thriving
far better on legal methods, than on
illegal methods and overthrow." It
was the _non-proletariat_ (or the pre-capitalist
working class) --- artisans,
craftsmen, apprentices --- who appeared
to be more responsive to the call of
the _International Workingmen's Association_.
Even in England, where
Marx's observation of the _industrial
proletariat_ in his early days inspired
him to build up the model of the
future revolutionary class. "trade union
support was to come largely from
building unions and from such relatively
backward industries as tailoring,
clothing, shoe-making and cabinet-making.
In mining, engineering and
heavy industry generally, its strength
was small non-existent" (Henry
Collins and Chimen Abramsky, "_Karl
Marx and the British Labour Movement;
Years of the First International_",
1965). Another historian, describing
the composition of the _Paris Commune_
in 1871 refers to the overwhelming
majority of "copper-, bronze-, and other
metal-workers, carpenters, masons,
house decorators and bookbinders".
and adds: "What is striking is how
small a number came from the new
heavy industries that had grown up on
the outskirts of Paris" (Stewart
Edwards (ed) "_The Communards of
Paris, 1871_", 1973).

The point is: Marx could feel in his
bones the future path which capitalist
production system was taking. But his
perception of the role of the _proletariat_
which flowed from this analysis
collapsed under the weight of the very
logical implications of the capitalist
development which he so prophetically
delineated.

Engels of course maintained in the
above-quoted 'Introduction' written in
1895) that although the Communists
were thriving far better on legal methods,
they did not thereby in the
least renounce their right to revolution,
and that the main task of the day
was to keep the growth of the electorate
who voted the Communists going
without interruption "until it of itself
gets beyond the control of the prevailing
governmental system, not to fritter
way this daily increasing shock force
in vanguard skirmishes, but to keep it
intact until the decisive day". But
these words were more an act of faith
than an appeal to evidence. From the
empirical evidence available since those
words were penned, it has become
obvious that the temporary phase envisaged
by Engels for the preparation
of the _proletariat_ for the "decisive
day", has become a _status quo_, and
the _proletariat_ itself has undergone a
transmutation.

The problem of perceptive and
honest Marxists engaged in practice is
that while they recognise that the
reality every day undermines the validity
of the theory of the omnipotence
of the _proletariat_, fear of an ideological
Vacuum prevents them from giving up
the theory on the one hand, and from
plunging heart and soul into revolutionary
movements expressing aspirations
for social change which are led
by other sections of the population, on
the other. Even when they opt for the
latter course (as the Chinese Communists
under Mao did when they turned
to the peasantry), the delay that precedes
it involves tremendous waste and
sacrifice in terms of human lives (as
happened in China during the abortive
experiments with working class insurrections
in 1927). In most cases, the
stubborn faith in the powers of the
_proletariat_ that prevails among the
official Communist parties, is overtaken
by spontaneous revolutionary upsurges
by the _non-proletariat_. In such situations,
the Communist parties react with
ill-concealed dismay, and even open
opposition (as happened in Cuba and
some other Latin American countries
in the early 1960s, or during the students'
movements in France and other
European countries in the late 1960s).

Yet, as mentioned earlier, the _proletariat_
in industrialised countries, as
well as in developing countries with a
growing industrial sector, enjoy certain
advantages --- not because of any exclusive
psychological bent of mind
peculiar to that class, but because of
pure technical reasons: its position as
the driver of the locomotive of capitalism.
Its ability to stop the wheels
can be a valuable asset for revolutionaries
trying to overthrow the old
society. But then, similarly valuable is
another arm of the capitalist state ---
the repressive machinery comprising
the police and army. Their participation,
however marginal, or even their
neutralisation, can accelerate the success
of a revolution (as in Russia and
China). If one has to come down to
the brass tacks of making a revolution,
or seizing power by insurrection, the
_proletariat_ could be stripped of all the
theoretical trappings and reduced to
the same functional agent as the armed
forces.

# PART II

The transformation of the role of the
_proletariat_ --- from the central driving
force into a marginal factor in the
programme of a revolutionary change
--- has been caused by several developments,
chief among which are the increasing
trend of automation in the
production processes in the industrial
world, and the emergence of a hybrid
_proletariat_ in the Third World.

To take up the first development.
Marx us usual was prophetic in delineating
the course of automation, resorted
to by the industrialists to reduce
expenditure and throttle expression of
labour protest like strikes, sabotages
and absenteeism. ("In England, strikes
have regularly given rise to invention
and application of new machines. Machines
were, it may be said, the weapon
employed by the capitalists to quell
the revolt of specialised labour" Marx.
"_Poverty of Philosophy_", 1847. Compare
this with the following comment
made in 1981 by the _International
Documentation and Communication
Centre_ of Rome: " ... the increasing
use of industrial robots will solve
management problems ... for robots
work all day without demanding pay
increases or 'humanised' work conditions".)

Marx also anticipated the rise in unemployment
as a consequence of increased
mechanisation : "It \[machinery\]
brings about the same results. where
it is newly introduced, by throwing
the hand workers on the streets in
masses. And, where it is developed, improved
and replaced by more productive
machinery, by discharging workers
in small batches" ("_Wage Labour and
Capital_", 1847). Since those words
were written, the extent of both
mechanisation and consequent retrenchment
has reached mind-boggling proportions,
The numerical strength of
the traditional _proletariat_ employed in
industries is shrinking fast. In Britain.
where 3.2 million are unemployed at
the moment. strength-wise the _industrial
proletariat_ is lagging behind those
employed in the service industries and
the white collar employees (comprising
57 per cent of the total workforce). In
the USA the vehicle manufacturing
industry alone intends to invest so
heavily labour-saving equipment
over the next few years that 128,000
auto-workers (over 18 per cent of the
total production workers in the American
industry) at General Motors,
Ford, Chryslers and American Motors
will lose their jobs by 1985.

But the cake is taken by Japan.
where unmanned manufacturing plants
are to operate from 1990. It has been
estimated that with a control crew of
only 10, a fully automated factory
could produce the equivalent of a conventional
factory employing 700.

Even in India, the long electronic
arm of the computer is moving fast.
The newspaper industry is a case in
point. Following the introduction of
computerised phototypesetting, which
transfers much of the skill input in
printing from the human being to the
machine, several newspapers have already
started retrenching workers.

Judging by the growing trend in
displacement of labour by machines, it
seems that the future centre of growth
of revolutionary consciousness will no
longer be the shopfloor, but the streets.
In Marx's days, growing mechanisation
leading to displacement of labour and
their formation into an _industrial reserve
army_ was expected to open the
eyes of the _proletariat_ to the "antagonism
between the organisation of
production in the individual workshop,
and the anarchy of production in society
generally. (Engels, "_Socialism,
Utopian and Scientific_"). The increasing
organisation of production through
introduction and increase and improvement
of machinery, upon a social
basis --- the "socialised organisation of
production" --- was to show the workers
the way to accomplish the revolution:
"The _proletariat_ seizes political
power and turns the means of production
into state property (_ibid_).

## THE COMPUTER COUNTER-REVOLUTION

Marx's prediction that the application
of machinery will be followed by 'still
greater application of machinery' has
come out to be true. But instead of
leading to further socialisation and
collectivisation prompting an awareness
of a socialist alternative, computerisation
has led first, as already mentioned,
to a gradual decrease in the numerical
strength of the _industrial proletariat_
(thus knocking out one of the premises
assumed by Marx in his _Communist
Manifesto_: " ...with the development
of industry, the _proletariat_ ... increases
in number ...") and two, to segmentation
in the production process (contradicting
the other Marxian premise ---
"The various interest and conditions of
life within the ranks of the _proletariat_
are more and more equalised, in proportion
as machinery obliterates all
distinctions of labour ...") and consequently
change in the pattern of
consciousness of those few workers
engaged in such production.

In the course of rationalisation of
production in modern capitalist economy,
the worker's old power of control
over the production
process is subdivided,
fragmented. Working alone, or
in a group of two or three, with a
single machine and repeating strictly
predetermined tasks, the worker tends
to get more self-centred, instead of
becoming collective-minded which
marked his nature in the traditional
factory Production process.

Through the scattering of work
places, the organisational strength of
the working class is diminished. The
implications are clear for a future revolutionary
movement. The 'workers'
power to paralyse an entire work process
by strikes has been crippled.

The ruling powers' control over the
lives of these workers is no longer confined
to the factory or the work places,
but extends to their social existence.
During working hours, in a cubicle, or
an office room, the worker trained in a
specialised job, presses buttons with
eyes glued to a screen to contribute his
little bit to the working of a vest process
of production the various stages
of which he is totally unaware of, and
which are being controlled from above.
After the working hours, he retreats to
another cubicle --- his home, a pub,
or a theatre hall --- to live a simulated
fairy tale life, controlled again by
powerful external agents like advertisements,
television, etc., etc.

It is this dissociation from a collective
production process, a growing individualisation
of the style of work in
the West, availability of compensation
for the dehumanisation of work in the
various avenues of entertainment offered
by a consumerist society, and above
all, a conditioning of the minds of the
workers by a highly technologically
sophisticated capitalist society (through
the media --- advertisements, films,
newspapers, etc.) towards an inclination
for accommodation, and aspirations
that can be met within the capitalist
society, which mute the once-dreamt-of
revolutionary potentialities of a
rapidly decreasing working _proletariat_
in the West. Could Marx have taken
into account the trade off between
material standards of living and material
comforts and the dissatisfaction of
work?

Marx incidentally, visualised the
effects of technological agencies replacing
human labour --- but in socialist
society --- where he hoped that
the "reduction in necessary labour
time" due to the introduction of advanced
machines would not be to
"constitute surplus value", but to correspond
"to the artistic, scientific, etc.
cultivation of individuals, by virtue of
the free time and means made available
to them" ("Grundrisse"). But the optimism
of Marx has been frustrated, since
the social relations of production and
the logic of capital have not been
Overturned. Labour-saving devices like
computerisation have taken over before
a decisive victory has occurred in
the struggle for new and higher social
relations --- before a change in the
social relationship of production had
taken place.

## _RESERVE ARMY_

What happens to the millions who
are thrown out of jobs by automation?
Instead of taking any initiative in
destroying the system, they manage to
hollow out a place for themselves within
the system, thanks to the availability
of unemployment doles (again
achievement of the trade union movement
in the West) and other odd jobs.

Their children --- the next generation
from the _proletariat_ class --- are
growing up us non-workers. Never
having worked in their lifetime, their
mental make up is bound to be different
from that of those who work, or those
who once worked and are now unemployed.
In Britain, these are the
elements who swell the rank of the
'skinheads' and are potential recruits
for fascist and racist organisations like
the _National Front_. They correspond
more to the '_lumpen proletariat_' of
Marx's days --- that "dangerous class,
the social scum, that passively rotting
mass" --- but not thrown by the "lowest
layers of old society" as propounded
by Marx in the _Communist Manifesto_.
On the contrary, today they
are very much the children, though
illegitimate and disowned, of the
modernising process of 20th century
capitalism. Their counterparts are to
be found even in a developing country
like India, where the ranks of the unemployed
are being swelled by new
generations who have never worked ---
and will probably never get any work ---
but are still surviving on the new opportunities
provided indirectly by a
half-baked capitalist system that shares
with an advanced capitalist state like
the USA, the common features of a
well-knit, wide-spread underworld. This
is a new sector of the capitalist political
system, which was outside the ken of
Marx's analytical framework but which
today has an important bearing on political
developments in both the highly
industrialised countries of the West
(where the Mafia is both subsidised by,
and subsidises the political leaders) and
the Third World countries (where the
new _lumpen-proletariat_, because of their
numerical strength and rootlessness ---
they are probably the only ones who
have nothing to lose but their unperceived
chains --- can be driven to
any desperate action that can be utilized
by either the Rightists or the
Leftists to pressurise the ruling power).

The composition and the mood of
the '_industrial reserve army_' have
thus changed beyond recognition since
the days of Marx. Instead of becoming
allies of the _working proletariat_ in a
revolution to overthrow the capitalist
state, the unemployed and the marginally
employed have become absorbed
in the system, often acting as allies of
the state against the _proletariat_ (e.g.
in the role of _blacklegs_).

## THE INDIAN WORKER

When we come to the Third World,
the complexities take on a new dimension.
The Indian worker in many ways
typifies the problems of the Third World
_proletariat_ (local peculiarities notwithstanding)
combining in himself the
stratification between skilled and unskilled,
strong kinship loyalties bearing
traces of a still powerful feudal rural
environment, and susceptibilities to
the influences of urban social life rather
than to specific industrial situations.
among other things.

The existing Leftist parties in India
remain outside this many-sided reality,
the diversified fragments of _proletarian_
life and character. A concrete study
of the Indian _proletariat_ in the strict
sense of the word will show them to
have hardly any of the characteristics
attributed by Marx.

In the traditional industries like jute
or textiles, or the communication system
like railways, the Indian Worker
leads a schizophrenic existence in a
different sense. He is half worker, half
farmer. It is not uncommon to find a
textile mill worker in Bombay or Calcutta
--- coming from a middle farmer
family --- retaining his small plot of
land in his village. While in the city
and in his work situation, he can be
a militant trade unionist fighting for
better wages, or even a Communist
seeking to develop these struggles into
a class wär for political capture of
power, back in his village he can be
mini-exploiter, hiring agricultural
labourers and treating them as serfs
--- or worse, should he happen to belong
to the higher caste and the hired labourers
_scheduled caste_ persons. How
do we designate such a worker in
Marxist terms? Could Marx have ever
envisaged the emergence of an _industrial
proletariat_ owning landed property
as a means of production? What motivation
could lead such a worker to
make a revolution for a social change?

Even those landless who join the
ranks of the _industrial proletariat_ in
India, retain personal ties with their
homes in the villages and continue to
be influenced by the values of a rural
feudal culture. It makes them less demanding,
conditioned as they are by
traditional fatalistic values and violent
oppression by feudal landlords at home.
As a result, they are often better disposed
to accept without much protest
the prevailing working and living conditions
of an industrial system, which
to many among them might appear far
less repressive than the economic and
social persecution of landlords back in
their villages.

It is not that the _industrial proletariat_
in India has not shown itself
capable of outbursts of heroism. The
railway strike of 1974, and the recent
Bombay textile mill workers' strike are
major instances of such heroic actions.
But what needs to be noted is that
there have not been any solidarity actions
in other sectors of the industrial
scene, underlining again the increasing
difficulties of unifying a fragmented
working class engaged in widely dispersed
workplaces. Widespread, simultaneous
industrial actions all over the
country that would paralyse the economy,
are difficult to organise today, not
only because of the limited organisational
capacities of the revolutionary
forces who might be interested in overthrowing
the state, but because of the
very inclination of the _proletariat_
which is satisfied with bargaining over
its share in the product and getting it,
instead of willing to wrest control of
production itself.

In the organised sector, the working
class is highly conscious of
unionised strength. But this strength
is used for purely protective
purposes --- job security, better
wages, etc. In some cases, unionisation
has become a synonym for protection
of corruption and irresponsibility
among the workers. In the Indian
metropolises, for instance, unions
among the public transport workers are
some of the strongest in the organised
sector. Wildcat strikes have become
convenient tools in the hands of the
unions and the workers for instance to
blackmail the management and the
public into letting away an errant
worker who might deserve punishment
for rash driving causing perhaps the
death of a pedestrian, or for cheating
the passengers. While strikes, sabotage
or absenteeism had been traditional
weapons in the hands of the working
class against capitalist exploitation,
when these weapons are used by workers
in the public services, they tend to
harm the common people more than
the state. A strike in a hospital affects
adversely the poor and middle-class
patients than the rich who can afford
to go to expensive private nursing
homes for their treatment. Since even
in normal times, the public rarely get
efficient services from the staff employed
in places like post offices, railway
counters, hospitals or public transport,
when these workers go on strike, however
genuine their demands might be,
they seldom receive any sympathy from
the public. The hostile attitude of the
unionised and privileged workers in
these services towards the poorer sections
of the population which is demonstrated
every day in the Indian cities ---
a bus conductor hurling rude abuses
on a migrant labourer trying to board
the bus, or a hospital employee ill-treating
a patient from a lower income
background, or a railway counter clerk
dismissing haughtily an illiterate poor
traveller seeking information are quite
common occurrences --- is yet another
factor that is widening contradictions
within the Indian working class.

Thus, in the organised sector of
Indian industry, there is a split between
industrial actions (strikes and
agitations for wage hikes, negotiations
to ensure social mobility and a measure
of economic success within the capitalist
system), and political actions (movement
to control means of production,
which is completely absent). Even
when industrial actions appear to
break out from the conventional grooves
and grope for political solutions
(through autonomous demands and new
forms of actions) the establishment
tries to re-establish the authority of the
recognised trade union apparatus and
submits the workers' claims to juridical
rules. The workers are again caught
up in the sluggish quotidian flow of
things. The ruling classes which
create conditions for the birth of the
working class, also determine its reformist
behaviour.

As for the vast masses of unorganised
workers --- migrants from rural areas,
contract labour working in factories
permanently haunted by an uncertain
future, the numerous women and children
workers employed at construction
sites without the minimum benefits and
protection, artisans and craftsmen fighting
a losing battle in a fierce competition
with industrial products --- they
are an amorphous, heterogeneous crowd
difficult to be imprisoned in one single
category. These urban nomads, moving
from one job to another, do not develop
any 'industrial' class consciousness.
The lure of the neon-lit, radio and TV-dominated
metropolis, which conditions
their minds to the values of a consumerist
society, creating expectations
derived from an industrial society
without providing the basic Wealth
which can even remotely fulfil those
expectations, yet constantly seducing
them to believe that the dream will
one day come true (if not in their
lifetime, in the lifetime of their children
--- the hero in a Hindi film, or the
story of a Jagjivan Ram often becomes
a symbol to them of social mobility
leading some among them to send their
offsprings to schools to compete for
white collar jobs), prevails alas over the
promise held out by the logic of
Marxism!

Driven by the urge to discover
unilinear pattern of development in
the growth proletarian consciousness,
Marx failed to note the possibility of
the contrary processes at work --- economic
gains and strength of trade
union organisation setting back development
in revolutionary consciousness
and now patterns of capitalist production
retarding a growth in revolutionary
capacity.

Like the Irish farmers in the 16th
century who sewed only one variety of
potato, Marx cultivated only one
class --- the _industrial proletariat_. In
late 1840s, the genetically uniform
potato crop in Ireland was struck by
blight. In a remarkably short space of
time, the Irish lost their primary food
source, leaving at least two million
dead and two million more searching
for a new life in other countries. The
great _Irish Potato Famine_ taught agriculturists
of the future not to depend
on a uniform variety of food crop, but
to interplant different crop species to
increase the diversity of the food
supply: as well as to reduce the risk of
relying on only one crop which might
be last from any epidemic outbreak.

The idea of the _proletariat_ as the
sole leader was implanted in the Communist
consciousness by Marx. Struck
by blight, the _proletariat_ today fails
to nourish the revolutionary ideology.
If the ideology has to survive and
change the world, there is need for
turning to other sections, other groups,
who might be able to act as new
nutrients for the programme of social
change. True to Marx's predictions,
modern capitalism while changing, continues
to generate its own adversaries
in new sectors, who might in future
act out the role assigned by Mark in
the past to the old _proletariat_.

## ALIENATION

While Marx's hope of a _proletariat_-led
revolution is fast dissolving in the
face of the onrush of modernised
capitalist production, which ironically
enough again has followed Marx's
predicted path, one must remember
that at the basis of his espousal of
the cause of the _proletariat_ there lay
something more than the law of development
of capitalist economy only.
To Marx the idea of the _proletariat_
was not merely an experiential concept,
but a philosophical concept. The
larger philosophical theory of _alienation_
was a more important driving
force to lead him to pick upon the
_proletariat_ as the chosen people who
alone, he felt, could change society.
Maybe today, the same theory can
illuminate other new forces in current
society which are probably more representative
of _alienation_ conscious of
itself, and hence, capable of sustained
protest against the prevailing socio-economic
order and of changing it.

Marx's theory of _alienation_ is not
something restricted to the assembly
line in the modern factory, but a
deeply rooted social and political
phenomenon. What lies at the root
of _alienation_ --- which pervades all
sections of society and all forms of
activities --- is the consequence
social action, man's practical activity
in a world which he did not make.
The product which he creates "confronts
him as something alien, as
power independent of the producer",
the labour which he undertakes to
create it is 'external' to the worker,
and in the process even his senses
become 'externalised', to be used as
a means to serve _private property_.
This _alienation_ reaches its extreme
form and becomes all-pervasive in a
capitalist society, and it expresses
itself most poignantly in the life of
the _proletariat_:

>... the worker becomes
ever more exclusively dependent
labour, and on a particular, very one-sided
machine-like labour that ... it
is clear that the more the worker
Spends himself, the more powerful
becomes the alien world of objects
which he creates over and against
himself, the poorer he himself, his
inner world becomes, the less belongs
to him as his own ("_Economic and
Philosophic Manuscripts_")

In other
Words, the workers in a capitalist
society are condemned to produce
what they do not consume, consume
what they do not produce, and
unable to produce or consume according
to their own individual or collective
desires. The desires also
become alienated --- imposed upon
them by a society that is based on a
production system catering to the
needs of the ruling classes.

This extreme form of _alienation_
described by Marx is no longer today
confined to the _industrial proletariat_,
but has extended to other spheres of
activities in modern society --- both
in the Third World and the West.
Contrary to Marx's hope that the
_proletariat_ would be keenly aware of
this _alienation_, Over the years the
_proletariat_ had been sufficiently desensitised
(an extreme form of 'internalisation'
of _alienation_) to a state of
affairs where to quote Ralph Waldo
Emerson, "things are in saddle and
ride mankind". It is other sections
of the oppressed who have shown
more awareness --- and expressed
protest against it --- than the
_industrial proletariat_. Nothing could
more sharply express the sense of
_alienation_ of a peasant --- fusing both
that of his earthly existence and of
his occupational activities --- than the
following lines of a folk song from
West Bengal:

>I am not the owner of this hut.
>
>It is another's land on which
>I built a hut and live.
>
>The hut belongs to the landlord.
>
>But I never see the landlord.
>
>To suit his wishes.
>
>I sow the land.
>
>But it doesn't yield any harvest.
>
>I suffer all through the year.
>
>Whom should I tell my woes, my
>poor soul?
>
>I humour the landlord's whims.
>
>Yet, one day he puts up the land
>for auction.
>
>Whom should I tell my woes, my
>poor you?

In the allegory, the image of an alien
hut where he lives merges with that
of the body which he inhabits, and
over both he has no control, recalling
Marx's words

>Estranged labour.
... estranges from man his own
body (_Economic and Philosophic
Manuscripts_).

In the Third World, the source of
_alienation_ among the peasantry lies
in their working conditions --- loss of
land, expropriation of the crops they
sow, the onslaught on their cultural
norms by commercial interests. There
is a difference between the Worker's
and the peasant's relationship to
economic development. The intellectual
comprehension and emotional
perception of _alienation_ that Marx
found in the 19th century _industrial
proletariat_ who were still fresh to
the feeling of loss, had given way to
a state of inurement along the
modern _proletariat_ conditioned
they had been over the years by
progressive manipulation of their
senses by the sophisticated super-structure
of the capitalist state. While
the modern industrial worker is no
longer interested in the ownership of
the means of production, but only in
an appropriate share of the economic
product, the dispossessed peasant in
the semi-feudal countryside, even
when he is a wage-earner, feels that
only by recovering his lost land can
he put an end to his present state
and get back his 'natural and human
essence'.

_Alienation_ has opened up new
avenues of action to other non-proletarian
segments of society, both in
the West and the Third World. By
a peculiar twist of irony, while the
militancy of the industrial working
class is withering away, different
groups are emerging in the West as
new _foci_ of discontent. It is not accidental
that scientists have been playing
a leading role in the anti-war and
nuclear disarmament movement. Their
scientific discoveries have been turned
by the state into destructive
weapons creating a situation where
_alienation_ has assumed nightmarish
dimensions, the discoveries "confronting
the scientists as something alien,
as a power independent of the producer".

Another area which needs to be
considered as a major breeding ground
of _alienation_ is the university which
is playing a more important role in the
economy than it did in Marx's time.
Intellectual training and research in
the universities are an important adjunct
to the ruling classes today in
their efforts to influence economic
development. Both in the West and
the Third World, universities are becoming
more and more subordinate
to the criteria of a capitalist society.
The myth of _academic independence_
is being exploded. This generates a
new form of _alienation_ --- both among
the students and the teachers. Endowed
by a certain critical intelligence
because of their intellectual background,
they find that what they study
or teach does not allow them to
exercise their critical faculties. The
mal-adaptation of the university structure
and syllabi to the economic and
social reality, the contradiction between
the academic requirements of
the ruling classes and the haunting
perception among the teachers and
the taught of the crying demand for
a basic change, could be described as
a super-structural anticipation of the
final conflict between productive
forces and the relations of production
in the economic base of modern
society that Marx envisaged. It is not
accidental again that the students
emerged as the most radical participants
and proponents of a revolutionary
change --- both in the West and
some Third World countries (including
India) in the 1960s.

The history of the labour movement
during the last 100 years, marked
by the mutation of the proletarian
character, as well as the emergence of
new exploited groups who are more
keenly aware of their sense of _alienation_
and eager for basic socio-economic
change, and the radicalisation
of the peasantry in the Third World,
should have major lessons for practising
_Marxists_. It is not enough to be
responsive to the structural issues and
changes which are clearly visible ---
even to which most of them are indifferent,
obsessed as they still are
with the ritualistic prattling of Marx's
sayings --- but future structural
changes (like those under the impact
of computerisation) must be anticipated.
The possibility --- and even necessity ---
of looking to other sectors of
production and society for new agents
for carrying out a comprehensive programme
of social change (where the
traditional _industrial proletariat_ may
not be a leader, but a valuable ally
only) are quite urgent.

Marx, bound as he was by the
contemporary desire to find a simple
unifying norm for society like the
law of gravity that Newton had for
nature, and limited by the available
information of the changing situation
in areas outside Western Europe,
might have fixated on the _proletariat_
of his days as the main tool of social
change. But we, enriched by the
knowledge of new scientific theories
(falsifying the traditional tendency to
attribute certainty to science) and
the empirical evidence of new developments
(displacing on many occasions
the _proletariat_ from its pedestal of
revolutionary omnipotence), do not
have any right to turn Marx into a
computer, an infallible robot. Judging
by Marx's courage to respond to new
developments by honest reappraisals
of his old attitudes, the "swarthy
chap from Trier" who stretched up
his arms "to seize the winds on high"
(Engels poem of Marx, written in 1842)
would have been happier to see
us using his theories not as algorithms,
but as heuristics, as a method
of solving problems by evaluating experiences
of the past, and moving by
trial and error to a solution; to stop
us, from regarding the _proletariat_ as
GPS (General Problem Solver)
machine, but make us accept it as an
entity --- warts and all --- that cannot
be forced into a category; to find us
adopting his theory of the _proletariat_
rather more like a map of partially
explored territory, more to guide the
explorer in further discovery than a
final destination --- and of course, to
want us to discover the sources of
_alienation_ in individual minds, irrespective
of class origins, which alone
have always motivated people to
protest against oppressive social
orders and fight for transformation of
society.
