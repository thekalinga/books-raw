# _Gandhism_ After Gandhi

Now that we have come to the end of the story of the life
of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the question naturally arises:
Where does the Gandhian school of thought stand today, nearly
10 years after its founder met with the tragic end at the hands
of an assassin?

It is very interesting, in this connection, that, though many
of the close followers and colleagues of Gandhiji who are alive
today, were once reputed to be the chief exponents of the Gandhian
philosophy, they do not agree among themselves on the
essence of _Gandhism_ and its application to the complex problems
of day-to-day life. . As it was noted in the beginning of this book,
there are several followers and disciples of Gandhiji, each of
whom claiming to be loyally following his teachings while criticising
others for betraying the ideals for which Gandhiji spent
a whole lifetime.

It is also interesting that, while several of the followers and
disciples of Gandhiji differ among themselves as to the essence
of _Gandhism_ and the manner of its application to present-day
problems, one of them --- Acharya Vinoba Bhave --- is unanimously
acclaimed as the true follower of the Mahatma, his real
successor.

Vinoba Bhave was not known to the public as many others
were during Gandhiji's lifetime. The only occasion on which his
name was broadcast throughout India as a loyal follower of Gandhiji
was in 1940 when Gandhiji selected him as the first individual
satyagrahi to break the law as a protest against Britain's
forcing India into the war. People then came to know that he was
a loyal and devoted follower of Gandhiji, a silent and selfless
worker in propagating and practising the ideals and principles
for which Gandhiji stood and fought.

It was only after more than a decade since this incident that
his name again shot into prominence. The _Bhoodan movement_,
which he initiated in 1951, was hailed as a true application of
Gandhiji's principles to the most important problem which free
India has to solve --- the problem of land. It was bailed as an
alternative to the more painful method of forcing the landlords
to part with their land and distributing it to the peasants. It did
not matter whether this process of forcing the landlords was to
be done through the constitutional means of enacting legislations
as the _Congress_ governments proposed to do, or through
the militant mass _peasant action_ as the Communists sought to do
in Telangana. Just as in the case of Gandhiji, so in the case of
Vinoba Bhave too, it so happened that dozens of men and
women who towered above him in intellectual capacity and
other ingredients of personal eminence went to him, listened to
his exposition of the gospel of _Jan Shakti_ (people's power) as the
only effective means through which land and other problems of
the people can be solved. Ministers, professors and other eminent
men began to hail him as the leader of a movement which,
if successful, will lead to the realisation of the goal for which
they have all been working --- the goal of establishing a classless
and casteless society through non-violent means.

Barring this agreement in the matter of recognising Vinoba
Bhave as the true follower of their departed leader, there is no
point on which one follower of the Gandhian school of the present
day agrees with another. Take, for example, their attitude
to the world problems of the present day. There are, among the
present-day Gandhians, people who hold different views --- ranging
from those who are considered 'fellow-travellers' and 'crypto-Communists',
to those who would, at least in private, repeat
almost everything that the notorious anti-Communists of the
world have to say on the 'danger of communism'. On the problems
of internal economy and politics too, there are all manner
of views held by those who call themselves Gandhians, many of
them being members and leaders of different political parties.
On the other hand, there are some who had opposed Gandhiji
when he was heading the anti-imperialist movement, but who
today claim themselves to be his followers, and what is worse,
denounce many of the earlier followers of Gandhiji for their
'non-adherence to Gandhian principles'!

The question arises: Why is all this confusion within the
Gandhian school? Why is it that the followers of Gandhiji are
fighting among themselves? Is it a case of history repeating itself:
A prophet being able to keep his disciples united during his lifetime,
but after his death, they falling out among themselves? If
so, how is it that they are united in paying tribute to one of them
(Vinoba Bhave) as the true follower and successor of the
Mahatma? Again, why is it that, at the very time when the disciples
of the Mahatma are fighting among themselves on the
right way to apply his teachings to the present-day problems,
many of those who were opposing him during his struggle against
imperialism are today swearing by his name and claim to follow
him?

For an answer to these questions, it is necessary to understand
what is the essence of _Gandhism_. The answer usually
given is that the essence of _Gandhism_ consists in the application
of the moral principles of truth and _non-violence_ to the current
problems of society. This would, of course, be a correct answer,
but it would immediately raise another question: Is there something
like absolute truth or absolute morality; are there unalterable
ways of applying this absolute truth and absolute morality
to the current problems of life? For example, how is it that
Gandhiji did not only fail to denounce participation in the first
world war as a sin, but did himself actively participate in it on
the side of the British by going about in his own Gujarat province
recruiting soldiers for the British; while, during the second
world war, he considered it a sin not to dissociate oneself in
all possible ways from the war? How is it that what was moral
in the first world war became immoral in the second? Again,
how is it that the very Gandhiji, who in 1921 denounced the
government as 'Satanic' and called for the boycott of legislatures
in 1921, subsequently used his personal influence with his 'no-change'
followers to allow the _Swarajists_ to function through the
legislatures? 'How is it that Gandhiji, who ordered the withdrawal
of _civil disobedience_ and other forms of mass action
when mass' violence broke out in _Chauri-Chaura_, had no hesitation
in giving support to the _Congress_ governments (in the
provinces) who resorted to shooting of the masses? Is there
anything like absolute morality, absolute truth, absolute nonviolence,
etc., in all these mutually contradictory positions taken
by him?

These are questions which have been posed at various
places in the previous pages. Now that we have come to the
end of the story, we may sum up the discussion as a whole and
state that, just as for any other human being, for Gandhiji too,
truth, morality and _non-violence_ were not absolute but relative.
He judged everything by the acid test of whether a particular
course will help what was, in the larger interests, true and moral
--- the ending of British imperialism by peaceful and non-violent
means.

Recruiting Indian soldiers for British imperialism was moral
in the first world war, because, as he himself stated at the
time, the personal sacrifice of Indian soldiers in defence of the
British Empire would strengthen him and other fighters of self-government
within that Empire. On the other hand, participation
in the second world war was immoral, because the threat of
struggle against the war effort was, in the changed circumstances,
the best means of strengthening the struggle for independence.
Interestingly enough, Gandhiji allowed the _Congress_,
during certain phases of the movement, to negotiate with the
British on the basis of participation in the war, though he personally
abstained from participation; even this personal abstention
was part of the strategy of keeping himself free, if later on
the situation demanded it, to launch a struggle against the
British.

So was the position with regard to his attitude to the 'Satanic'
government and its legislative and other organs. Gandhiji
worked in 1921 for a mass boycott of the administrative organs
of the government, but subsequently proved himself skilful in
the negotiations with the Viceroy and other high officials.

It would, therefore, be dishonest for anybody to say that
Gandhiji was sticking to absolute truth and absolute morality;
equally dishonest will it be for anyone to claim that the followers
and colleagues of Gandhiji were absolutely loyal to all that Gandhiji
himself preached and tried to practise. On the other hand,
there are ever so many of his colleagues and followers who, in
private talks, used to make fun of what are called 'Gandhi's
fads'. The well-known discussion as to whether _non-violence_
was a creed or policy, and the stand taken by several of his followers is
that, while for Gandhiji it was a creed, for themselves it
was only a policy, illustrates the relative character of the loyalty
of both Gandhiji as well as his followers to the basic tenets of
what is called '_Gandhism_'. Gandhiji's ability to unite them all
arose out of the fact that he applied the principles of truth,
morality, _non-violence_, etc., to the needs of the anti-imperialist
struggle as it was conceived by the class that was leading that
struggle during his lifetime --- the _bourgeoisie_. That class appreciated
his skill in unleashing the mass of the toiling people
and uniting them against the British, as well as in restricting the
activity of those masses within the limits that are safe for the
_bourgeoisie_. As the tide of anti-imperialist struggle followed its
successive ebbs and flows, Gandhiji felt the pulse of the people,
kept contact with the British, and used his contact with both to
keep the fire of anti-imperialism alive among the people. At the
same time, he took care to see that the fire did not devour those
who were afraid that their own interests will suffer if the common
people came into their own. It was precisely because of
this particular manner of Gandhiji's application of the principles
of truth, _non-violence_ and morality that the true representatives
of the _bourgeoisie_ hailed him as their leader, though they had
their own reservations with regard to the principles he preached.

The basic change that took place in the situation in August
1947 made it unnecessary for such an approach to problems. A
gulf, therefore, appeared between Gandhiji on the one hand and
most of his colleagues on the other. His colleagues felt that,
since state power had come into their hands, there was no necessity
for any mass movement; on the other hand, mass movements
might become a positive hindrance to them. Whatever reforms
the socio-economic system required could be made through the
use of the state power. Gandhiji, however, was not so hopeful.
As has been explained in the preceding chapter, he was stricken
with grief at the new developments that were taking place on
the eve of and after the transfer of power. He thought it necessary
to reformulate his principles to meet the altered situation.
It was out of this realisation on his part that his well-known proposals
regarding the shape of things to come in free India
emerged. He proposed that the _Congress_ should be transformed
into a non-political organisation --- _Lok Sahayak Sangh_ --- which
will exclusively devote itself to the service of the people.

This idea of transforming the _Congress_ into a non-political
organisation was rejected by the leaders of the _Congress_. It
appeared ridiculous to them that an organisation which had
fought for several decades for securing political power should
deprive itself of the opportunity to use the newly-won political
power in the interests of national development. They therefore
set before themselves the programme of utilising the state
machinery that came into their hands on 15 August 1947 to reconstruct
India on the lines which appealed to them.

Gandhiji's idea, however, was taken up by a very small
group of his closest followers and disciples working in the name
of the _Sarva Seva Sangh_. They took the pledge that they would
not aspire for any position of power in the new political set-up:
offices of ministers, MPs, MLAs, etc., were foreign to them; they
would devote themselves to the service of the people through
the same _constructive programme_ which Gandhiji had evolved
during his lifetime, with such modifications as they thought
necessary under the altered circumstances --- _khadi_, village industries,
_basic education_, etc. In other words, they functioned
the _Sarva Seva Sangh_ in the same way in which Gandhiji had
wanted the _Congress_ to function in the post-independence era.

It was out of these activities of the _Sarvodaya_ workers, led
by Acharya Vinoba Bhave, that a new movement was initiated --- the
movement of _Bhoodan_. The circumstances in which this
movement originated are well known: the peasants of Telangana
who had originally risen against the Nizam-_shahi_ and who
in the course of the anti-Nizam struggle had put an end to landlords'
rule and redistributed land, came up against the _Congress_
regime which succeeded the Nizam-_shahi_. Violent clashes took
place between the peasants who tried to retain the land which
they had seized from the landlords, and the police who were
employed in suppressing the peasants' revolt. Dozens were shot
dead, hundreds were arrested and imprisoned, and other forms
of terror were employed in the struggle.

It was these developments that set Acharya Vinoba Bhave
thinking on how these sufferings of the people can be avoided.
The solution that flowed out of this thinking is typically Gandhian.
Rejecting the method of revolutionary seizure of land
adopted by the peasants under Communist leadership, he also
rejected the method of bringing about agrarian reforms through
legislative measures adopted by the _Congress_ governinent; in
place of both these methods (each of which, in its own way,
involved violence in the solution of social problems: while the
first was mass action and thus involved direct violence, the
second involved the use of the state machinery which, after all,
is the use of organised force by the majority against the minority),
he advocated the method of voluntary parting of the land
by those who owned it. His well-known slogan of 'every man
to part with one-sixth of his or her land for the landless' was an
alternative both to the revolutionary seizure of land by the peasants,
as well as to the constitutional method of imposing the
will of the majority over the minority. _Jan Shakti_ (people's
power), as opposed to _Raj Shakti_ (state power), for the solution
of the land problem --- this is the essence of _Bhoodan_.

It was this _Bhoodan movement_ that went through various
phases and became _Gramdan_. Bhave is no more satisfied with
people surrendering one-sixth of their land as he was in the
phase of _Bhoodan_, but wants everybody to surrender his or her
entire property. Abolition of private property (property in land
to begin with); the pooling of the entire land property of a
village into the common property of the village community, the
common cultivation of all the village lands and equitable distribution
of the produce of the land; organisation of cottage industries
and other means of livelihood in the common interest of the
people of the village --- such, in short, is the picture of the new
villages visualised by Bhave when he speaks of _Gramdan_.

This, therefore, can correctly be called the application (to
the main problems of the post-independence era in our country)
of those very principles which Gandhiji had applied to the problems
of our country in the years of anti-imperialist struggle.
The objective which Bhave placed before the people is as revolutionary
as any socialist or Communist would have; it is that
very basic principle, 'from each according to his ability, to each
according to his needs', which, according to the Marxists, can be
applied only in the higher phase of socialism, or its communist
phase. However, this objective has to be realised not through
the prolonged process of political struggle by the working people
under the leadership of the working class; transformation of the
ruled majority of the oppressed and exploited classes into the
ruling classes; establishment of the state power of the working
people and through it the abolition of class distinctions; the
development of the productive forces of society to such a stage
that it will be possible, in actual practice, to realise the goal of
'to each according to his needs', etc., but through persuasion and
change of heart. This is the essence of _Gramdan_ or _Gandhism_
at its latest phase; and it is here that it differs from Marxism.

Bhave and his followers claim that they have discovered
through this _Gramdan_ movement, the only possible and correct
solution for the social problems facing our country. This, however,
is not conceded either by the _Congress_ leaders or by such
parties of the left as the _Communist Party_, the PSP, etc. While
admitting that Bhave's preachings against the evils of private
property in land and the necessity for the reorganisation of the
entire village life would help the process of socio-economic
transformations, they point out that these transformations cannot
be brought about except through the use of state machinery.
Despite all the successes attained by Bhave and the _Gramdan_
movement under his leadership, the fact remains that the big
landlords do not respond to his call for the abolition of private
property in land. That was why the Mysore conference of political
leaders, convened by Bhave in order to discuss the _Gramdan_
movement, made it perfectly clear that while the political
leaders, belonging to different political parties, have full sympathy
for this movement, they do not consider it as a substitute
for governmental action by way of land reforms, organisation of
the cooperative movement, etc. It was agreed that the voluntary
movement for socio-economic changes initiated by Bhave
and governmental action are complementary to each other.

It is significant, in this connection, that the majority of the
most eminent colleagues of Gandhiji in his lifetime do not have
that faith in the _Gramdan_ movement as a panacea for the socio-economic
ills of our country which Bhave and his colleagues
have. The significance of this will be clear when it is seen that
most of those who today have less faith in _Jan Shakti_, or people's
power, and more faith in _Raj Shakti_, or state power, than Bhave
and his colleagues have, were the very people who differed from
Gandhiji on various occasions and on various issues, such as the
attitude to legislatures and elections, the attitude to participation
in war, the programme of transforming the _Congress_ into a non-political
organisation of service to people, etc. For, it means that
their acceptance of Gandhiji as their leader, and the Gandhian
philosophy as the basis of their activities, was just a means to
realise the end of political power. They accepted Gandhiji's
preachings of truth, _non-violence_, morality, etc., only because it
helped them to realise their goal of political power. Today, too,
they are not prepared to renounce political power and its use,
since they feel, as hard-headed realists, that the success or failure
of any movement for socio-economic change very much depends
on who wields political power and how it is used.

As for the Communists, Socialists and other leftists, it is
clear to them that political power is an essential factor in the
struggle for socio-economic transformations. As the founders
of Marxism had declared a century ago, no class voluntarily renounces
power; an individual here or an individual there may
be roused by the noble preachings of a Bhave or some other
idealist and renounce power and property; but the landlords, the
capitalists, and other exploiting classes will not, as a class, willingly
subject themselves to the social transformations dreamed
of by visionaries and fought for by practical revolutionaries.
They will, therefore, certainly wish Bhave and his colleagues
well, do all that is within their power to help the propagation of
the ideals of the _Gramdan_ movement, but will never give up
their struggle for political power.
