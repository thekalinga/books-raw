# Introduction to the Second Edition

Is it a correct statement to make, as many eminent gandhians
are making, that _Gandhism_ is communism minus violence ? Or,
is it that _Gandhism_ is qualitatively different from Marxism-Leninism,
as certain other eminent Gandhians and all Marxists hold?

This is a question which is certain to provoke much discussion
among those who are interested in the future of our country.
For, on a correct answer to this question depends our understanding
of the path which our country must take in its advance
to socialism.

Obviously, this demands of us a careful study of the essentials
of _Gandhism_ as well as Marxism. It is easy for us
to study the latter, since there is a voluminous literature on it;
some of which (like Engel's _Socialism --- Utopian and Scientific_,
Lenin's _Karl Marx_, Stalin's _Dialectical and Historical Materialism_,
etc.) provide brief summaries of the essentials of Marxism. It
is not so easy for us to study the former. Here one has to go
through the entire life-work of Mahatma Gandhi, carefully study
his speeches and writings running into several thousands of
pages before one could arrive at some sort of an assessment. No
brief summary of what are the essentials of _Gandhism_ has yet
appeared.

All that is possible under the circumstances is to study such
biographical works as Tendulkar's and Pyarelal's volumes in
order to get a glimpse of Gandhiji the man, his ideas and his
practical work. Such a study of these biographical works will
enable us to understand the essence of what Gandhiji preached
and how his preachings worked in practice. It is obvious that
such studies made by different persons with different outlooks
will lead them to different assessments. But the result of such
different studies by different persons may be expected to give us
clarity as to the essence of _Gandhism_.

It was as a contribution to such a study of _Gandhism_ that
I started a critique of the life and teachings of Mahatma Gandhi,
sometime in 1954. The occasion for it was the publication of
the 8-volume biography of Mahatma Gandhi by D. G: Tendulkar.
A series of articles by way of reviewing these volumes were
written for the _New Age_, the monthly theoretical organ of the
_Communist Party of India_. These series were concluded in 1956
with the article 'August 15 --- Triumph or Defeat?', which is Chapter
12 of this volume. They were brought together in book form
with such revisions as were considered necessary for making a
connected story out of a series of separate articles written from
time to time. Two more chapters were added at the time Meaning
of _Gandhism_' and '_Gandhism_ after Gandhi' as chapters
13 and 14. This was how the first edition of the _Mahatma
and the ism_ happened to come out in January 1958.

A large number of friends, known and unknown, showed
interest in this work, both at the time when the original articles
appeared in the New Age, as well as when they were
brought together in book form. Words of full and unmixed appreciation,
appreciation combined with friendly criticism, unmixed
and very sharp criticism, and even cheap ridicule --- all
these were received by me, particularly after the first edition of
the book came out. I should take this opportunity to express
my gratitude to all those friends who made such comments, since
they all have helped me to re-examine my approach to the study
of the Mahatma and his mission.

Let me, however, make it clear that I do not see any reason
for changing the assessment made in the book. In saying this,
I do not at all deny that other assessments are possible and which,
in fact, have been made by other friends. As a humble student
of the history of the Indian national movement and of socialism,
it would be my endeavour to try to understand every such viewpoint
on _Gandhism_, as I hope it would be the endeavour of those
friends to try to understand mine. It is only through such a
process of study and exchange of views that a correct estimation
can eventually be made.

My assessment of the Mahatma and his teachings is, of
course, based on the world-outlook of Marxism-Leninism. Let
me, however, add that _Gandhism_ is not something which I
studied after I became a Marxist and merely with a view to
criticise it. Like several Indian Marxists, I was a disciple of
Gandhiji long before I became a Marxist. As a matter of fact, I
reached Leninism through a long process of growing into and
out of _Gandhism_.

The first signs of political consciousness came to me through
the personality of Mahatma Gandhi and the nation-wide movement
that he initiated and led in 1920--21. As a mere boy of
11 or 12, I was fascinated by the whirlwind campaign of _noncooperation_
started by him in those days. The scrappy reports
of the activities of Gandhiji and his associates which appeared
in the Malayalam press in those days (there were then no daily
papers in Malayalam) almost brought a new world before
my mind.

Ever since those days, I grew up with the Mahatma and his
teachings. In the days of the great debate between the _Swarajists_
and the _No-Changers_, the latter had my full sympathy. I
started imposing on myself some of the disciplines of the Gandhian
_constructive workers_, traces of which may still be found
in me.

With the appearance of a left or radical tendency within
the Gandhian School (the tendency represented by Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru), I became an ardent follower of the Nehru
School. Later on, when this left trend within the Gandhian
School went still more to the left, leading to the formation of the
_Congress Socialist Party_ (whose founder-general secretary and
foremost leader, Sri Jayaprakash Narayan, has now become one
of the foremost leaders of what may be called the "Gandhians
after Gandhi), I joined it. It was out of this leftist trend within
the Gandhian School that I took the 'leap' from _Gandhism_ to
Marxism-Leninism. May I add that it was because respected
colleagues like Sri Jayaprakash did not take this 'leap' that many
of them took a swing back from a near-Marxist stand to
_Gandhism_?

The 8-volume biography of the Mahatma by D. G. Tendulkar
is, therefore, not a matter of history for me, but (except for the
first volume which mostly deals with the pre-_non-cooperation_
era) a part of the story of the Indian national movement in
which I was a participant --- for the first decade or so, not a very
active participant but not a passive onlooker either; and for the
later period of nearly two decades, an active participant as well.

Let me also inform the reader that I had the good fortune
of having personal contacts with many of the well-known leaders
of the Gandhian School. The year and a half which I spent in
Vellore Jail in 1932--33 were spent in close, day-to-day personal
contacts with such eminent Gandhians as C. Rajagopalachari,
who was then known as "Gandhi's conscience-keeper'; Dr. Pattabhi
Sitaramayya who was known for his erudite commentaries on
the various aspects of the Gandhian theory; Desabhakta Konda
Venkatappayya, the saintly-looking leader of the _No-Changers_,
who was almost fanatical in his Gandhian faith; Bulusu Sambamurthy,
a personification of the practice of Gandhian asceticism,
etc. etc. I cannot but recall with a feeling of nostalgia the great
evening 'durbars' held by Dr. Pattabhi in front of our jail ward
where he lectured to the band of disciples who surrounded him
to drink in the wealth of information which he would convey to
them. Nor can I forget the large number of jokes cracked, witticisms
made, and serious comments offered during dinner time
by the foremost leaders of the Gandhian School in South India,
among whom I was placed for over a year and a half.

It was against this background of personal association with,
and active participation in the movement led by Mahatma
Gandhi that I undertook the critique, _The Mahatma_ and the
Ism. Two questions naturally posed themselves before me when
I undertook this critique: _Firstly_, why is it that millions of young
men and women like me joined the camp of _Gandhism_ in 192021
and subsequently? _Secondly_, why is it that several young
men and women like me slowly grew dissatisfied and disillusioned
about the Mahatma and began to join the camp of
Marxism-Leninism --- first in dozens, then in hundreds, and
subsequently in thousands?

These questions can be answered only if we trace the story
of Mahatma Gandhi and the role he played in the national
political life. Gandhiji as the product of his age; the particular
forces which moulded his personality and his political outlook,
the surroundings in which he found himself when he entered
his political life; the objective with which he tried to transform
those surroundings; the technique of action which he utilised in
order to bring about this change in surroundings; the impact of
his actions on various classes and sections of the people - all
these have to be carefully analysed and their mutual connection
and significance discovered. This is exactly what I have tried
to do in my own humble way in chapters 2 to 12. The result
of this examination has, in the end, been summed up in the
chapter 'Meaning of _Gandhism_'.

Most critics have naturally taken up this chapter for their
criticism. They have tried to discover a 'contradiction' in my
assessment of Gandhiji. I stated on the one hand that he played
a big role in rousing the hitherto slumbering millions of the
rural poor; on the other hand, I stated that he acted as a leader
of the _bourgeoisie_. Is this not contradictory, they ask?

May I point out in all humility that there is no contradiction
in this unless the term _bourgeoisie_' is understood to mean merely
as an epithet of abuse. To say that the class essence of
one's approach to problems is _bourgeois_-democratic, rather than
proletarian, is not to say that one's approach to every question
is reactionary. A reference to the writings of the founders and
leaders of Marxism-Leninism will be enough to convince anyone
that the _bourgeoisie_ has, in every country, and at a particular
stage in the history of its national-democratic movement, acted
as a force which roused and organised the mass of the people
against reaction --- feudal, colonial or both. This role of the
_bourgeoisie_ has always been acclaimed and appreciated by
Marxist-Leninists who, however, have never failed to point out
that this role of the _bourgeoisie_ in rousing and organising the
masses has very serious limitations. While the classical revolution
made by the _bourgeoisie_ --- the French Revolution of 1789-1793
--- roused and led the mass of French peasantry in a direct
onslaught against feudalism, that very same _bourgeoisie_, in that
very same revolution, betrayed the very same peasantry when a
particular stage had been reached of that revolution. Basically,
the same story was repeated in subsequent _bourgeois_-democratic
revolutions which have been beautifully described in some
of the classical works of Marx and Engels (cf. _The Eighteenth
Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, The Class Struggles in France_
1848--1850, _Germany: Revolution and Counter-Revolution, Civil
War in France_, etc. etc.).

Lenin too emphasised this dual role of the _bourgeoisie_ in
his writings on the national liberation movements in colonial,
semi-colonial and dependent countries. Hence it is only those
whe lack a correct understanding of the role of the _bourgeoisie_,
those who imagine that characterisation of someone as the ideological
representative of the _bourgeoisie_ is nothing but a term
of abuse, will find in my assessment of the Mahatma a contradiction.

Let me also add that, when I characterised Gandhiji as the
ideological representative of the _bourgeoisie_, I did not at all
ascribe to him any motive of protecting the interests of the
_bourgeoisie_. It is a misfortune of every human being that
history's verdict of what he or she does is different from what
he or she thinks he or she does. Mahatma Gandhi may have
honestly believed that he was safeguarding the interests of the
entire nation and not of a particular class or community. The
point is: What were the actual results of this practical activity?
This applies to lesser individuals as well. A famous saying goes,
'The path to hell is paved with good intentions'.

It will, of course, be unbalanced if one were to try to
assess a person only by the results of his actions; his intentions
are also important. As a matter of fact, the correct way of
assessing him and his work will be to find out his intentions, the
method through which he tried to fulfil them and the results
that followed them. This, I claim, is what I have tried to do
in this book.

The five-point assessment made by me in the chapter,
'Meaning of _Gandhism_', begins with the statement 'that he kept
before him certain ideals to which he clung till the end of his
life. ... These were indivisible parts of his life and teachings'.
Developing the point further, I repeated the same idea: 'The
moral values which he had preached in the days of anti-imperialist
struggle now became a hindrance to the politicians who
came to power. Gandhiji, on the other hand, remained true to
them and could not reconcile himself to the sudden change
which occurred in his former colleagues and lieutenants'. It is
to this loyalty to certain moral values and ideals which Gandhiji
showed down to the end of his life, and to the lack of such
loyalty to ideals and moral values on the part of his colleagues,
that I trace what I call 'the growing gulf between him and his
colleagues in the last days of his life'. There is, therefore, no
question of my attributing any selfish or discreditable motives to
Gandhiji. On the contrary, I give him full credit for his
idealism.

But, as in the case of such prophets as the Buddha, Jesus,
or Mohammed (not to speak of lesser mortals), Gandhiji's ideals
and moral values were not mere abstractions; they were part of
the great drama of history in which millions upon millions of
human beings were involved.

Any one of us (not to speak of such prophets) may have so
many ideals which, by themselves, may be good or bad. They
would, however, remain with the person who preaches them
unless they conform to the vaguely felt desires and requirements
of other persons. The larger the circle of people with whose
requirements and desires one's ideals conform, the more successful
are his preachings and the more popular is the person who
preaches them. The Buddha, Jesus and Mohammed were great
prophets, precisely because the ideals and moral values to which
they clung to conformed to the requirements and desires of the
millions of human beings, not only in their lifetime but for
centuries thereafter.

Gandhiji, too, was great because the ideals and moral values
to which he clung to the end of his life conformed to the requirements
and desires of the millions of the Indian people. His
teachings were for the nation as a whole a call of revolt.
Particularly were they a call of revolt to the mass of rural poor,
the lowliest of the lowly in the villages, the 'Daridranarayans'
as he called them. His conception of love, truth, justice, etc.
were, in the context of the time, an inspiration for the mass of
the rural poor to free themselves from the social, economic and
political bonds, which have tied them to imperialism and feudalism.
The mass of the rural poor, therefore, looked up to him
as a new messiah, their saviour and protector.

It was, however, not only the mass of the rural poor, but
other sections of the nation, too, who found in Gandhiji a great
man who preached certain ideals and moral values which corresponded
to their desires and immediate interests. The Indian
working class which had not yet developed its own independent
political movement found in him the champion of their interests.
The middle-class _intelligentsia_ and youth, fired as they were
with the passion to work and fight for something great and
noble, found in him an inspiring leader who taught them how
to fight for a noble cause and die if need be. Even the well-to-do
ladies and gentlemen of the upper classes --- the _bourgeoisie_
and the landed gentry --- found in him the man who was an
ardent patriot working selflessly for a noble cause and, above
all, keeping 'the mob' within the strict limits of _non-violence_.

He, therefore, became the leader of various sections of the
people whose desires and requirements naturally varied. Nevertheless,
he was able, at least in the beginning, to keep them
united under his leadership, since what he had preached gave
some sort of satisfaction to all of them. However, as the movement
began to advance, these conflicts of the interests and
desires of different sections came out into the open. It was this
phenomenon that led to conflicts within the organisation which
he led in the various phases of its history.

Summing up all these conflicts which arose as a result of his
leadership in the movement, we come to the conclusion that
Gandhiji's idealism had its strong and weak points. His strong
points may be summed up in his ability to rouse the masses and
organise them in the struggle against imperialism and feudalism;
his weak points may be summed up in his insistence on a scrupulous
adherence to what is called _non-violence_, which, in effect,
served to restrain the mass of workers and peasants who want
to shake off the triple yoke of imperialism, feudalism and capitalism.
This, incidentally, is precisely what the interests of the
_bourgeoisie_ demanded. They wanted the mass of our people to
be roused and organised against imperialism and feudalism;
they, however, wanted these masses to be severely restrained in
their actions and struggles. It was this coincidence of what the
interests of the _bourgeoisie_ required and the totality of the
results of Gandhiji's leadership that is meant when I say that
Gandhiji's approach to life and history is a _bourgeois_-democratic
approach.

I would also like to refer to one other point made by some
critics about the book. They say that the earlier chapters are
more critical of Gandhiji and his movement than the subsequent
chapters. For this so-called 'fact', they seek to find an 'explanation':
The first chapters were written when the Soviet academicians
were denouncing Gandhiji while the subsequent chapters
were written after they modified their stand!

I may tell them that there is no such difference in approach.
Take, for example, the assessment of the South African movement
in the chapter 'Early Years'. As in the case of every subsequent
movement, here, too, I pointed out the fact that the movement
which he initiated and led was an all-class movement, but
drew its real strength from the militancy and self-sacrificing
spirit of the poor toiling sections of Indians in South Africa.
After pointing out how he was deeply moved by the spirit of
struggle and self-sacrifice shown by the common people and
how it left an indelible impression on his mind, I made a critique
of the manner in which he led and organised the struggle. Connected
with this critique of his organisation and leadership is
the critique of his _social outlook_ as emerging out of his book
_Hind Swaraj_.

It is this approach of approving his role in mobilising and
leading the masses while at the same time making a critique of
his organisational leadership, and the socio-economic outlook
that guides his leadership, that has been taken by me through
the entire course of tracing the story of the Mahatma and his
teachings; and it is this that has been briefly summed up in the
chapter 'Meaning of _Gandhism_'.

While the very 'fact' mentioned by the critics is thus an
invention of their imagination, it is needless for me to rebut
their 'explanation'.

Some critics have also made the wild and baseless statement
that I made some basic revision of the original articles when
they were being brought out in book form. This alleged 'basic
revision' is ascribed to the need for modification of the original
stand in accordance with the modification made by the Soviet
academicians! Let me point out that no such 'basic revision'
was made by me. As was pointed out in the beginning of this
Preface, I made only such revisions as were considered necessary
for making a connected story out of a series of separate
articles written from time to time. Most of these revisions were
modifications in style. Only very few revisions were made to
give a more connected story of the developments in the field of
national politics at the time. Not a single one of the revisions
constituted any modification in my approach to _The Mahatma
and the Ism_.

Let me, however, once again express my appreciation of,
and gratitude to the criticisms made by friends, as they made it
possible for me to re-examine the various aspects of the assessment
made in this book.
