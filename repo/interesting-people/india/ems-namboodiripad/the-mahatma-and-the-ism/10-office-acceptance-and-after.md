# Office Acceptance and After

While the right-wing leadership did not very much bother
itself with this growth of the left forces in the first stage of the
anti-imperialist _united front_ --- the stage in which it was preparing
itself to meet the challenge of the British and winning a
resounding electoral victory --- it found this new situation extremely
inconvenient after it had won its victory over the British.
With the acceptance of office by _Congressmen_ in several provinces,
says Tendulkar,

>New problems arose and internal conflicts which have so far been
largely ideological, took new shape. No one, not even the opponents
of the office acceptance, wanted to create trouble for _Congress_
leaders, but there was a continuous attempt to bring pressure upon
them by kisan demonstrations and strikes which embarrassed the
_Congress_ leaders greatly. In Bihar, the kisan movement came into
conflict with the _Congress_ organisation. Elsewhere also, the high
hopes that had been raised by the advent of the _Congress_ leaders
not being fulfilled dissatisfaction arose (IV, p. 248).

This, therefore, was a situation in which the right-wing
leadership of the _Congress_ under Gandhiji's guidance had in
fight a two-pronged battle --- against the British who were trying
to force the extremely reactionary federal part of the Indian
constitution and against the forces of the left which sought to
use the election campaign and its results to push the _Congress_
further to the left and to strengthen the forces of radical anti-imperialism.
It was no more a question of uniting the right
and the left in a common front against the national enemy, but
of strengthening the position of the right both in relation to the
left as well as in relation to the British. It was to meet this new
situation that the _Congress_ leadership under Gandhiji worked
out a strategy whose essential features may be summed up as
follows:

_Firstly_, a concerted attack was launched on the working
class and peasant organisations --- attack in the form of police
repression on the one hand and ideological attack on the other.
Arrests, prosecutions, lathi-charges, even firings, began to be
resorted to against working class and peasant organisations;
sections of the _Penal Code_[^10/1] and the _Criminal Procedure Code_[^10/2],
which had become notorious through their use by the British
against the _Congress_, began to be used by the _Congress_
against the militant mass movement. All this was justified by
Gandhiji who defended the _Congress_ ministries which resorted
to them on the ground that

>Civil liberty is not criminal liberty. ... In seven provinces, the _Congress_
rules. It seems to be assumed by some persons that, in these
provinces at least, individuals can say and do what they like. But
so far as I know the _Congress_ mind, it will not tolerate any such
licence (IV, pp. 248--49).

_Secondly_, they used the power that they had secured in the
provinces to solve some of the problems which the nation was
facing and thus to strengthen themselves in relation to the
British and also to prove that they are quite capable of solving
the main problems facing the country. It is significant that, not
long after the assumption of ministerial office the _Congress_ convened
a conference of industrial ministers in the _Congress_ provinces
in order to evolve a common plan of economic development
for the whole country. It was at this conference that a
national planning committee with Jawaharlal Nehru as chairman
and K. T. Shah as secretary was formed. This was the first
significant effort on the part of the _Congress_ to prepare a blueprint
of the future independent India, the first effort to translate
into practice the glorious vision that had been placed before the
country by Sir M. Visweswarayya in his book on _The Planned Economy for India_.

Equally significant was the conference of educationists
which worked out the broad outlines of the new educational
system that the _Congress_ would like to introduce in place of the
imperialist system that was prevalent. (This was the beginning
of what is today called _basic education_.) These efforts at 'constructive
solutions' of the main problems of the nation, together
with the 'firm' handling of the 'law and order situation' in the
provinces, were supposed to prove that the _Congress_ was not a
party of 'irresponsible agitators', but a 'responsible party with
a '_constructive programme_' and the necessary 'administrative
experience' to implement it.

_Thirdly_, they worked out a new approach towards the
Indian States and their people's movements for democratic
reforms.

The traditional approach of the _Congress_ since the days of
_non-cooperation_ was one of 'non-interference in the internal
affairs' of the States. This was justified on the ground that the
national struggle was against the foreign oppressor and that the
relation between the princes and people of the various Indian
States was an 'internal affair', rather than part of the national
struggle. That was why, even at the time when the 1928 Nehru
Report was being prepared, the question of the Indian States
was strictly kept out of the purview of the _All-Parties Committee_'s
consideration.

It was, however, proved at the _Round Table Conference_
that the British were using the position of the princes as the
instrument with which to fight the _Congress_ and its demand for
_swaraj_. This became all the more clear after the _Government
of India Act_ of 1935 became effective. The princes had a vital
role to play in the scheme of Britain's bargaining with the Indian
political parties on the question of the federal part of the
constitution.

This anti-national use that was being made of the princes
by the British made it necessary for the _Congress_ leadership to
adopt a new policy towards them and their autocratic rule.
Furthermore, the new awakening that was seizing the entire
Indian people in the wake of the growth of radical forces
throughout the country was also having its impact on the people
of the Indian States. Whether the _Congress_ leadership liked
it or not, the people of the States were more and more coming
forward and fighting for their democratic rights under the slogan
of _responsible government_.

It was in this situation that the Haripura session of the
_Congress_, held in February 1938, adopted a new policy towards
the States. According to this policy, the _Congress_ changed its
old 'non-interference in the internal affairs of the States' to encouraging
the States' people to form their own organisations and
fight for _responsible government_. It, however, continued its
old policy in the sense that the _Congress_ as such did not function
as a political organisation in the States. Gandhiji himself started
giving advice to the movements in one State after another. His
chief lieutenants like Jamnalal Bajaj, Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya,
etc., began to take active part in these struggles. Gandhiji himself
personally led the struggle in Rajkot.

Explaining this change in the _Congress_ policy, he said:

>The policy of non-intervention by the _Congress_ was, in my
opinion, a perfect piece of statesmanship, when the people of the
States were not awakened. That policy would be cowardice when
there is all-round awakening among the people of the States and a
determination to go through a long course of suffering for the vindication
of their own rights (V, p. 30).

However, as in the case of other struggles led by him, here
too, he found that the people, once roused into accion, had a
'peculiar' tendency of going beyond the limits set by him. The
States' people's movements of the latter half of the 1930's were
more or less on the same level as the movement in 'British India'
during the _non-cooperation_ days. The spontaneous outburst
of anger against oppressive rulers led to several incidents in
State after State which Gandhiji could not approve. In Travancore,
in Rajkot, in the Orissa States, etc., Gandhiji discovered
that his principles of _satyagraha_ were not being strictly adhered
to'. Thus he came to evolve what is known as 'new technique'
in relation to the States' people's struggles which he explained
as follows:

>I am convinced direct negotiations should be opened with the
authorities. Hitherto, the _State Congress_ people have talked at the
authorities and the latter at them. The result has been a widening
of the gulf between them. It would not do for a satyagrahi to argue
that the approach must be mutual. ... The first and last work of a
satyagrahi is always to seek an opportunity for an honourable approach. ...
If the leaders have active _ahimsa_ in them, they must
cultivate a belief in the perfect possibility and necessity of such approach.
And if they have that belief, the way will surely be opened
to them (V, pp. 152--53).

This, therefore, was an effort to show the princes that, while
the _Congress_ had the backing of the awakened people of the
States, it was by no means anxious to see the people's movement
develop on 'dangerous' lines; it was, on the other hand, anxious
to control them and bring them on lines which would be 'safe'
to the princes themselves. It was, in other words, a call to the
princes to join the _Congress_ against the British, rather than the
other way.

_Fourthly_, while thus trying to control the forces of the left,
to strengthen and consolidate the position it had won through
the formation of ministries and to use the new awakening of the
States' people in order to come to an understanding with the
princes, the _Congress_ leadership concentrated its attention on
fighting the federal part of the constitution. It demanded that
a new, democratically-elected constituent assembly should be
convened in order to frame the future _Constitution of India_. It
was on this question of the future constitution, particularly its
federal part, that the gulf between the _Congress_ and the British
was the widest.

It is interesting to note that it was on this very same question
that the gulf became the widest between the right and the left
in the _Congress_ as well. While opposing the federal part of the
constitution and demanding a constituent assembly, Gandhiji
made it clear that he for one would be prepared to have negotiations
with the British government. In an interview with Mr.
Steel, the correspondent of the New York Times, Gandhiji went
to the extent of saying:

>If _dominion status_ could be so defined as to cover a case like
>India and if India could come to an honourable agreement with
>England, I would not quarrel about words. If British statesmen
>feel it convenient to use the word _dominion status_ about India rather
>than any other, in order to describe that honourable agreement, I
>will not quarrel.
>
>'But', rejoined Mr. Steel, 'there are elements in the _Congress_
>like Subhas Bose and his group who want absolute independence
>outside the British Empire'.
>
>'It is only a question of terminology', replied Gandhi. 'I will
>not admit any difference between Subhas Babu and myself on this
>point. though we may use different language' (V, p. 138).

Actually, however, the difference turned out to be far from
one of terminology, but of basic approach to the main politicalorganisational
questions which the _Congress_ had to face. There
were differences which had undoubtedly existed since 1934 and
had divided the _Congress_ into its right and left wings. They,
however, had been subordinated in 1934--38 to the necessity of
having a united _Congress_ at a time when it was fighting the first
general elections under the 1935 constitution. It was to this
end that the right-wing leaders of the _Congress_ thought it
necessary to have leftist presidents for three consecutive terms.
However, after the formation of _Congress_ ministries and after
conflicts developed on a large-scale between the provincial
ministries and rank-and-file _Congressmen_, the right-wing leadership
thought that the phase of concessions to the left should end
and a new phase of struggle against it begin. It was this that
led to the Bose-Pattabhi contest for the presidentship of the
Tripuri session, a contest which was by no means a personal
contest between the two, as can be seen from the actual course
which the struggle took.

When Subhas Bose decided to contest for a second term for
presidentship, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad, Jamnalal Bajaj,
Jairamdas Daulatram, Shankerrao Deo, Bhulabhai Desai and
Kripalani issued a joint statement urging Subhas Bose to reconsider
his decision and to allow Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya's
election to be unanimous.

Subhas Bose's reply was :

>... The attempt to set up a rightist candidate for the office of president
is not without significance. It is widely believed that there is a
prospect of a compromise on the federal scheme between the rightwing
of the _Congress_ and the British government during the coming
year. And consequently, the right-wing do not want a leftist
president who may be a thorn in the way of compromise and may
put obstacles in the path of negotiations. ... It is imperative, in the
circumstances, to have a _Congress_ president who will be an antifederationist
to the core of his heart (V, p. 36).

Sardar Patel revealed in a statement issued on 25 January
that the decision to set up Dr. Pattabhi as candidate was taken
'at the informal consultations at one stage or the other at which
Maulana Azad, Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, Bhulabhai
Desai, Kripalani, Mahatma Gandhi and myself were present'.

Jawaharlal Nehru made a statement on 27 January in which
he did not contradict Sardar Patel's statement regarding his
participation in the above-mentioned informal consultations. He
did not commit himself either for Pattabhi or for Subhas Bose,
confining himself to 'regretting' that the presidential election
controversy has taken an unfortunate turn. He made the categorical
assertion that there was no question of a conflict over
federation in this election as the _Congress_ had definitely rejected
this scheme. In other words, he took a stand of not directly
and fully joining the rightists but virtually coming out against
Subhas Bose's stand.

The result of this keenly-fought-out election contest was a
rightist defeat, the voting being 1580 for Subhas Bose and 1375
for Pattabhi. On the announcement of the result, Gandhiji wrote:

>Sri Subhas Bose has achieved a decisive victory over his opponent,
Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya. I must confess that from the very
beginning, I was decidedly against his re-election for reasons into
which I need not go. I do not subscribe to his facts or arguments
in his manifestos. I think that his references to his colleagues were
unjustified and unworthy. Nevertheless, I am glad of his victory.
And since I was instrumental in inducing Dr. Pattabhi not to withdraw
his name as a candidate, when Maulana Azad withdrew, the
defeat is more mine than his (V, p. 30).

The right-wing leadership, however, was not prepared to
take this defeat lying down. As a matter of fact, the very statement
of Gandhiji that he considered Subhas Bose's victory as
his own defeat was used by them to mobilise public opinion to
have the verdict of the _Congress_ delegates reversed. Twelve
members of the _working committee_ --- Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad,
Rajendra Prasad, Mrs. Naidu, Bhulabhai Desai, Pattabhi Sitaramayya,
Shankarrao Deo, Mehtab, Kripalani, Daulatram, Bajaj
and Ghaffar Khan-resigned their membership of the _working
committee_. In the course of a joint letter, 'believed to have been
drafted by Gandhi', they wrote:

>We feel that the time has come when the country should have
a clear-cut policy not based on compromise between different incompatible
groups of the _Congress_. It is but right, therefore, that you
should select a homogeneous cabinet representing the views of the
majority (V, p. 56).

Though not signing this joint letter of resignation, Nehru,
too, resigned his membership of the _working committee_. In a
separate letter he revealed that

>he had tried his best to bring about a compromise. He had pressed
president Bose to withdraw the charges made by him in his preelection
statements with regard to the rightists compromising with
the British government cn the question of federation (V. p. 56).

The resignation of the thirteen members of the _working
committee_, including Jawaharlal Nehru, was the beginning of
the most serious internal crisis which the _Congress_ had to face
so far. That crisis was ultimately solved by the victory of the
right.

The deep concern which the delegates showed at the
Tripuri session was fully utilised by the right-wing leadership
to have a resolution adopted, according to which Bose was to
nominate a _working committee_ for the ensuing year in accordance
with the wishes of Gandhiji.

However, when Bose approached Gandhiji for his advice,
he was told :

>Knowing your own views and knowing how most of the members
differ in the fundamentals, it seems to me that if I give you the
names it would be an imposition on you. I had argued this position
at length in my letters to you. Nothing that has happened during
these three days of closest conversation between us has altered my
view. Such being the case, you are free to choose your own committee
(V, pp. 102--3).

This attitude of Gandhiji forced Bose to resign his presidentship.
Rajendra Prasad was elected in his place. He nominated
a new _working committee_, consisting so exclusively of
right-wing leaders that even Jawaharlal Nehru was kept out of
it. One of the first steps taken by the new _working committee_
was to convene a meeting of the AICC and to have two important
resolutions adopted against the stout opposition of Subhas
Bose, the socialists and other leftists. One of these resolutions
prohibited _Congressmen_ froin offering, or organising, any form
of _satyagraha_ in the administrative provinces of India without
the sanction of the _Provincial Congress Committee_ concerned.
This was obviously intended to prevent _Congressmen_ from participating
in the innumerable _peasant actions_ that were developing.
Dr. Lohia argued:

>The people today do not regard your (Gandhiji's) own programme
in the ministerial action and _constructive activities_ as wholly
adequate; they are experimenting with such programmes as those
of _peasant action_. These newer programmes entail an amount of
local and isolated action, even during such times when there is no
general _satyagraha_ (V, p. 176).

Gandhiji answered :

>I regret to have to say that, in most cases, the peasants are not.
being educated for non-violent action. ... Indeed, what I see around
me is not the preparation for a non-violent campaign but for an
outbreak of violence, however unconscious or unintended it may
be (V, pp. 177--8).

This resolution turned out to be the beginning of an intense
organisational struggle. Subhas Bose and several other officebearers
and members of the executive committees of the
_Congress_ decided to observe 9 July as a 'day of protest'
against the AICC resolution. The observance of this
protest by them was considered by the _working committee_
which resolved 'that for his grave act of indiscipline, Sri
Subhas Chandra Bose is declared disqualified as the president
of the _Bengal Provincial Congress committee_ for three years as
from August 1939'.

This naturally led to an intense conflict between the right
and the left. However, before it could lead to large-scale
expulsions from the _Congress_, a far bigger crisis of world
importance had developed. Hitler launched his attack on
Poland. This was followed by Britain declaring war on Germany,
and declaring India a party to this war. Countrywide resentment
at this British action --- making India a party to the war without
consulting public opinion in India --- reached an almost explosive
stage when the Viceroy promulgated a number of ordinances
since, according to him, 'a grave emergency' existed whereby
'the security of India is threatened by war'.


[^10/1]: _Penal Code_ is law that defines what kind of conduct is considered by the State to be a crime & the punishment for such crimes

[^10/2]: _Criminal Procedure Code_ is the law that defines the process followed from the time of accusation of a crime till the guilt/innocence of the accuse is estrablished such as investigation, arrest, taking the accused before judges, bail, trail, e.t.c. While crimes & punishments are mentioned in _Penal Code_ (+ other laws), this law describes the procedure for ensuring the accused rights are protected (atleast thats the theoretical basis, but reality is far far worse)
