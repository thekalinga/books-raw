# AFTER THE WITHDRAWAL

## THE REVIVAL OF _SWARAJ PARTY_

In March 1933, the Government issued a White Paper
containing the details of what it was contemplating to do
in the direction of _constitutional reforms_. According to the
new proposal, the government at the Centre would by and
large remain the same as before, while a certain degree of
flexibility would be introduced in the administration of the
provinces with as many restrictions imposed on the elected
representatives as possible.

Following the publication of the White Paper, an attempt
was also made to ascertain Indian public opinion on the new
proposal for _constitutional reforms_. Also, a Joint Select
Committee comprising members of both the Houses of the
British Parliament was appointed to go into the new Government
of India Bill framed on the basis of the White Paper.
This committee was also assigned the task of ascertaining
the Indian public opinion. Commenting on this procedural
steps and the White Paper, the liberal leader CV Chintamani
said:

>The White Paper scheme was a cruel denial of the most
cherished aspirations of the people of this country. It is
utterly incorrect to say, as the British apologists of the new
constitution have shown a repeated fondness for saying,
that the report embodied the results of joint deliberation
between the British and the Indians. The Indian 'delegates'
presented two memoranda to the Committee, one by all
British Indian 'delegates' headed by His Highness the
Aga Khan, and the other separately by Sir Toj Bahadur
Saru. Their proposals did not err on the side of excess, and
they stated the very minimum of changes which would
satisfy any section of Indian opinion. But it was all love's
labour lost. Not a solitary recommendation made by the
Indian 'delegates' proved acceptable to the British. The
Joint Select Committee achieved almost a miracle by
making the White Paper scheme still worse --- an amazing
feat indeed. All the Bills in its passage in Parliament
underwent further changes for the worse, all to satisfy the
British die-hardism. Indian opinion was almost stunned
by the result of years of agitation and cogitation, and
many sections of it, including the Liberal and left, said
that it would have been for better if no reform had been
attempted.[^17/1]

The _Congressmen_, the liberals and other nationalists
were unanimous in arriving at the conclusion that though the
new scheme contained some positive features, as it often
happened with any scheme, it was on the whole not at all a
step forward in the direction of _constitutional reforms_, as it
was loudly claimed to be. It was, in fact, to isolate these
sections that the government was making a conscious effort of
placating the communal-caste politicians. And it was the _Muslim
League_ that stood in the forefront of the communal-caste
politics. As we have noted earlier, Jinnah who had earlier
held nationalist views against the _League_'s sectarian attitude,
later took an anti-Congress stance helpful to sectarianism
following the adoption of the _Nehru Report_. We have
also seen that Jinnah had put forward certain proposals
known as the '14-points' to counter the principal themes
contained in the _Nehru Report_, thereby giving an organized
form to the Muslim sectarian politics. Similarly, Maulana
Muhammed Ali, a close associate of Gandhi during the
_Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_ movement also took a completely
sectarian position at the _Second Round Table Conference_.
The attitude of a number of once staunch nationalists, including
Muhammed Ali's brother Shoukat Ali, underwent a
familiar change.

On the other hand, a number of nationalist Muslims
who consistently stood by the Congress were not recognized
by the British as representatives of the Muslims. It may be
recalled that the proposal to include Dr. Ansari among the
Congress delegates to the _Second Round Table Conference_
was rejected by the British on the pretext of opposition
from other representatives of the Muslims. Furthermore,
this Muslim communal politics turned out to be helpful to
the government in rallying the Christians, Anglo-Indians, the
Depressed Castes and others against the Congress. The only
gain of the fast undertaken by Gandhi in September 1932
and the subsequent events was that it enabled the Congress
to win back the Depressed Castes from the government camp.

However, even the Muslim politicians who occupied a
vital position in the anti-Congress maneuvers of the British
were critical of the new reforms proposal. For example,
Jinnah stated that the proposals relating to the administration
at the Centre which was an important part of the whole
scheme were "devoid of all principles fundamental to a
federation". He therefore characterized that part of the
scheme "absolutely bad". But, according to him, the proposals
relating to the administration in the provinces were
different and constituted a step forward. At the same time, he
pointed at the provisions for special powers to the Governor
and for the constitution of the upper house at the provincial
level which he considered objectionable.

The Congress spokesman Bhulabhai Desai also protested
against the denial of roles to Indians in the Central administration.
As for the provincial level administration, he said
that the ministers who should be responsible to the legislature
were placed between the devil and the deep sea. On the one
side was the Governor armed with special powers, and, on
the other, the permanent bureaucracy capable of exerting
tremendous influence through backdoor against the ministers
to whom they were, in fact, responsible. Besides, the
resources for national development were not under their
control. "Why was such a ludicrous scheme, called 'provincial
autonomy' placed before us?", he asked.

Thus, all the three sections, the Congress led by the
_bourgeoisie_, the liberals, and the communal-religious politicians
were equally opposed to the scheme formulated by
the government obviously for the reason that, since there
was no change in the administration at the Centre, the
_bourgeoisie_ would not be able to protect its class interests.

Besides, the special powers of the Governor and the
opportunities they provided for the bureaucrats to act against
the wishes of the people were sharply criticized by all the
three sections. It is significant to note that Jinnah was against
upper House, an issue left untouched by both Chintamani
and Bhulabhai Desai. In other words, neither the communal
political leader Jinnah, nor the liberal leader Chintamani had
differences with the Congressman Bhulabhai Desai over the
question of transfer of power from the British.

However, conditions were lacking then for the _bourgeois_
leadership of these three sections to face the British unitedly.
For there was no agreement among the leaders of the three
sections on the apportioning of the power to be transferred
from the British. Furthermore, there were serious differences
between the liberals and the Congress led by Gandhi over
the means to be adopted for obtaining power from the British.

On the basis of the evaluation that under the prevailing
political conditions, the continuance of _civil disobedience_
would do more harm than good. Gandhi and Aney held informal
consultations with other top _Congressmen_ and decided
to withdraw the movement after reaching a settlement with
the British, if possible, or unconditionally otherwise. Under
these same political conditions, certain other moves came
from a section of the Congress leaders. In the words of
Pattabhi Sitaramayya:

>Ever since the Poona Conference of July 1933, an
increasing number of _Congressmen_ were coming to form
the view that, in the situation existing in the country as a
result of _Ordinance rule_, a programme of entry into the
Legislatures was necessary to find a way out of what was
held to be a 'stalemate'. This view found an organized
expression in a move to summon a Conference of Congress
leaders sharing the above opinion for the purpose
of giving concrete shape to the desire for a new line of
action. This Conference met at Delhi on 31 March 1933,
under the Presidentship of Dr. Ansari. It resolved that
the All-India _Swaraj Party_ which had been in abeyance
should be revived in order to enable _Congressmen_ who
were not offering _Individual Civil Disobedience_ to undertake
a thorough organization of the electorate and carry
out the _constructive programme_ as contemplated in the
Poona statement of _Mahatma Gandhi_ (July 1933).[^17/2]

[^17/2]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _The History of Indian National Congress_, Bombay,
Padma Publications (1946 reprint), p. 567.

Accordingly, a team consisting of Dr. Ansari, Bhulabhai
Desai and BC Roy met Gandhi and held discussions with
him. The central point of the talk was that the _Swaraj
Party_ or the Congress itself must contest the elections
scheduled to be held towards the end of 1934. They also
proposed two main issues to be placed before the electorate:
(1) withdrawal of all the existing repressive laws, (2) rejection
of the government proposals relating to the _constitutional
reforms_ and adoption of the national demand on the
line proposed by Gandhi at the _Round Table Conference_. In
other words, the objective of the resurgent _Swaraj Party_
was to seek a popular mandate against the government on
the basis of the very demands raised by Gandhi and other
Congress leaders through the _civil disobedience movement_.

Subsequently, on 5th April Gandhi wrote a letter to
Dr. Ansari in which he stated:

>I have no hesitation in welcoming the revival of the
>_Swarajya Party_ and the decision of meeting to take part
>in the forthcoming elections to the Assembly which you
>tell me is about to be dissolved.
>
>My views on the utility of the Legislatures in the present
>state are well known. They remain, on the whole, what
>they were in 1920. But I feel that it is not only the right
>but it is the duty of every Congressman who, for some
>reason or another, does not want to or cannot take part in
>civil resistance and who have faith in entry into the Legislatures,
>to seek entry and form combinations in order to
>prosecute the programme which he or they believe to be
>in the interest of the country. Consistently with my view
>above-mentioned, I shall be at the disposal of the party
>at all times and render such assistance as it is in my power
>to give.[^17/3]

[^17/3]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _Ibid_, p. 568.

Two days later, Gandhi issued a statement limiting the
responsibility of _civil disobedience_ to himself and relieving
other _Congressmen_ form it. The meaning of this exercise is
clear. All except those who were not interested, like himself,
in parliamentary activities would engage themselves in parliamentary
work. Others would withdraw themselves from the
disobedience movement and would confine themselves to
the activities like the production and propagation of _Khadi_
_Harijan_ welfare, anti-liquor campaign and other _constructive
activities_.

For Gandhi and other Congress leaders, this approach
had two distinct advantages. First, the demand of the
government that the _civil disobedience_ be stopped had, in
effect, been met, making it unjust on the part of the
government to keep tens of thousands of _Congressmen_ in jail
on that score. Second, there was no compromise on matters
relating to protest against repression and opposition to the
_constitutional reforms_ proposals put forward by the government
at the _Round Table Conference_ and thereafter. There
was a possibility of rallying against the government, the
liberals and the communal-caste politicians through the
programme of approaching the electorate with these issues.
In other words, it would be possible to fight for the common
interests of the _bourgeoisie_ and exert pressure on the government
through means far more effective than a protracted
_satyagraha_ struggle, individual or mass.

However, Gandhi knew that things would not materialize
as easily as the liberal leaders expected them to. Even
if the Congress won a massive victory in the elections to
the Central Legislative Assembly, the government would
be able to impose their _constitutional reforms_ on the people
with the backing of the princes and the communal-caste
politicians. Under that scheme, there would be constant
clashes between the government and the people's representatives.
In that circumstance, it would be unwise to lay down
permanently and completely the weapon of _civil disobedience_.
That was why Gandhi issued a statement on 7th April 1934
confining the right of _civil disobedience_ to himself and
declaring that he would resume the struggle in future only
when his "inner voice" called upon him to do so.

The situation changed swiftly after this. The government
allowed the congress to hold an _AICC_ session to enable it
to discuss and decide how it should function in the new situation.
Accordingly, the _AICC_ met on 18th and 19th May
at Patna. It decided to contest the next elections by fielding
its official candidates. A _Parliamentary Board_ with Dr.
Ansari as chairman was constituted to conduct the election
work under its control.

It is important that this decision was taken at the instance
of Gandhi, for, unlike a decade ago when the elections were
fought through the _Swaraj Party_, now it would be done
directly by the Congress through its _Parliamentary Board_.

This was a development which no one could have
imagined a couple of years ago. Parallel to this, certain other
developments also took place which also could not have been
imagined earlier. New trends of thought and outlook and
new organizations were emerging both within and outside
the Congress, as a result of which Indian politics in general
and the Congress, in particular, were undergoing a transformation.

## THE _COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDIA_

In May 1934, the Congress which had been banned for
over two years gained the facility to work openly. Within
weeks, a party which had been hitherto functioning legally
was declared illegal. That was the _Communist Party of India_.

We have already noted that several Communist groups
were emerging in the different parts of the country in the
beginning of the 1920s and that efforts were being made to
unite them into a unified _Communist Party of India_. Mentions
were also made of the several _conspiracy cases_ instituted by
the government with a view to place obstructions before these
efforts to form a centralized _Communist Party_. However,
the Party was never declared illegal. That is, apart from the
individuals who were striving to form a Communist organization
and do their propaganda work, the _Communist Party_
as an organization was not considered dangerous for the
existence of imperialism.

But the situation had changed by 1934. An organization
functioning under a centralized and perpetual leadership had
emerged. Although it was only a small drop in the vast ocean
of Indian politics, the rulers rightly feared that the _Communist
Party_ was likely to become a more dangerous and
_anti-imperialist_ organization than the Congress which was
far stronger and more popular throughout the country.

Over 30 political workers, both Communist and _non-Communist_,
were arrested. Earlier, we had dealt with the history
of the _Indian Communist_ movement up to what was known
as the _Meerut Conspiracy Case_. The accused were arrested
in March 1929. The trial lasted for four and a half years
at different levels, from the _Magistrate court_ to the _High
Court_.

The final judgement of the _High Court_ came in August 1933. Earlier, both the _Sessions Court_ and the _High Court_
had set many accused free and the sentences on some others
were reduced considering the period they were in prison.
The sentence on yet some others was also reduced and they
were released in November 1934.

As we have mentioned earlier, Dr. G. Adhikari and
PC Joshi who were among the accused became prominent
leaders of the _Communist Party_ and among other accused,
SV Ghate, SS Mirajkar and Sohan Singh Josh played
important roles in building up the party. In fact, all the
accused, both Communists, and _non-Communists_, except
Muzaffar Ahmed, SA Dange and Shaukat Usmani had
come out of the jail before the end of 1933.

With their release began the efforts to reorganize the
_Communist Party_. A Central Committee, its Politburo
and provincial committees in different provinces were formed.
With this, there was not only a restoration of the old link
which was snapped following the Meerut Case, but many
individuals and groups were newly attracted to the party.
The formation of the Central Committee and Politburo
marked the beginning of such activities as making available
documents of the _Communist International_ to Communists
and leftists, preparation of documents explaining the views
and policies of the _Communist Party_ on Indian political
situation, organized trade union activities, establishing relations
with left-wing politicians and so on.

This was not an easy task because the national and
international situations were changing rapidly. Basic changes
had begun to take place in the organization and policies of
the _Communist International_. The Meerut Case and the
consequent imprisonment of the accused had left the party
organization so disrupted that it could not comprehend the
rapidly changing international and national situations and
give appropriate and timely leadership. It would be useful
to recount here some of the changes that had come about.

During the initial period of the _Indian Communist_
movement, MN Roy had played a very helpful role.
Meanwhile, Roy had been expelled from the _Communist
International_. The Trotskyite group, which was more powerful
than Roy's, had also been similarly expelled from the
International. So, there emerged in India certain Communist
groups following the views of Roy and Trotsky and working
against the leadership of the International.

These organizational problems arose at a time when the
contradiction between _Capitalism_ and Socialism on the world
scale had become acute. The capitalist world was caught
in an unprecedented economic crisis, while the Soviet Union,
the only Socialist state then, was building up a planned
economic system to the utter surprise to its enemies. This
was a development which helped _anti-imperialists_ all over the
world, including those in India, to move closer towards
the Socialist movement. At the same time, the leaders of the
capitalist world were preparing for a crusade against the
Soviet Union and the Communist movement. They were
fostering the fascists in Italy and the _Nazis_ in Germany and
other reactionary semi-military organizations all over the
world.

The leadership of the _Communist International_ was
pondering over the question of how to face the new situation.
As a contribution towards this, the Communist parties in
the different countries were striving to formulate the tactics
to face the practical problems in their respective countries,
while the leadership of the International was trying to help
them to rectify the errors they were likely to commit in this
process.

The internal situations in India were not at all simple.
The repercussions of the economic crisis that engulfed the
capitalist world was more painful to the Indian people,
because the British imperialists were trying to resolve the
crises the people of their own country were facing at the
expense of the Indian people. Consequently, the protest and
anger against the British rule became deeper and more widespread.
Moreover, the political parties in India became more
and more convinced of the need to seek the assistance of
the Soviet Union and the revolutionary working class movement
all over the world.

However, the _Communist Party_ lacked the leadership
capable of utilizing these favourable conditions to create a
situation capable of challenging imperialism by joining hands
with other left and _anti-imperialist_ organizations. As we
shall see later on, it was a situation favourable to social
democrats and _bourgeois_ nationalists to transform the _anti-imperialist_
feelings of the people and the leanings of the
left-wing politicians towards Socialism into _bourgeois_-_petty-bourgeois_
policies and organizations.

The Lahore Session of the Congress in 1929 and the
year-long _first civil disobedience_ struggle which followed it,
the _resultant_ _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_ and the mass discontent
against the Pact, the launching and the failure of the _second civil disobedience_ caused by the pressure generated by the
mass discontent together with the uncompromising attitude
of the government during and after the _Second Round Table
Conference_ --- all these had changed the entire course of
Indian politics. This series of events was such that the people
could clearly perceive the bankruptcy of the policies being
pursued by the leaders of the Congress and other _bourgeois_
political parties.

But as against the _bourgeois_ policy which had been
proved bankrupt, there was no party leadership here handling
political issues with a working class revolutionary
outlook. Consequently, other parties and groups were able
to turn the _anti-imperialist_ feelings of the people into _bourgeois_
and _petty-bourgeois_ 'Socialist' trends of thought.

One of the reasons for this was the fact that all the
prominent leaders of the _Communist Party_ were in jail. In
addition, the character of the Communist groups that began
to emerge in the 1920s and the ideological perspective basic
to the efforts that were made to unify these groups also contributed
to this situation.

We have seen earlier that an organization called the
'_Communist Party of India_' was formed by Indian revolutionaries
in Tashkent in the Soviet Union. However laudable
the intentions of these revolutionaries, the political background
of its formation was not helpful for its growth in
India. With the arrival in India of these revolutionaries
from the Soviet Union and their subsequent arrest, the first
_Communist Party of India_ ceased to exist.

It was in 1925 at Kanpur that the _Communist Party of
India_ with a Central Committee was formed again. It played
a highly significant role in creating a condition for the
formation of an organized _Communist Party_ on the Indian
soil. It helped the spread of the Communist ideology among
the left-wing nationalists and workers and also the formation
of mass revolutionary organizations under its away.

It must, however, be noted that a _Communist Party_
with a perpetually functioning central leadership did not
come into being even in 1925, as is being claimed by the
leaders of the Right _Communist Party_. It was true that
nominally there was a _Communist Party_. It was also true that
each member of the party was engaged in political and organizational
activities. But the main field of their activities
was the Workers' and Peasants' Parties. Their attention was
centred around building a mass revolutionary party in which
even _non-Communists_ had a role to play.

However, unlike the _Communist Party_, this mass party
was not a party of the working class; it was a party of
workers and peasants. In other words, instead of organizing
the workers with a working class outlook and programme as
the leader of the peasants and other toiling masses, they
organized a joint party of workers and peasants. The Communists
of those days did not pay attention to organize a
party of their own class.

The leadership of the _Communist Party_ in the earlier
period had a more serious weakness. It was not at all conscious
of the fact that the Party would be subject to attack
at any time, and therefore, it should be organized on illegal
lines as well. Hence, when the Communists along with their
colleagues in the Workers' and Peasants' Parties came under
attack in the form of the Meerut case), the party organization,
in effect, ceased to exist.

Though individual Communists and groups conducted their
activities in many centres like Bombay and Calcutta, their
activities lacked ideological and even organizational uniformity.
There was no central organization capable of giving leadership
to these activities. The different Communist groups
remained aloof from each other and quarrelled with each
other. The period of four and a half years beginning with
the Meerut case was a period of difference of opinion and
factional fights among the Communists who remained outside
the jail. This had in a way affected even the conduct of
the Meerut case.

As already pointed out, there were Communists and
non-Communists among the accused in the _Meerut Conspiracy
Case_. Therefore, the non-Communists defended their case
individually or in groups, while the Communists defended
independently.

The Communists submitted a common statement to the
court. The statement which explained the objectives of the
Communists was also signed by certain accused who had not
yet become members of the Party. But SA Dange who
is known as a founder-member of the _Communist Party_ was
not a signatory to the statement. This was because Dange
had been expelled from the Party unit in the jail on the
ground that he was personally responsible for the factional
fights in the Party organization in Bombay. Hence, he was
not allowed to sign the common statement of the Communists.
He read a separate statement on his own behalf before
the court.

Parallel to these developments in the jail and in the
court, the different Communist groups fought each other
outside. In all these fights ideological and organizational
issues were intertwined with issues of personality. A discussion
of such matters is clearly beyond the scope of the
present volume. What is relevant here to note is the fact that
the '_Indian Communist Party_' which the leaders of the present
_Communist Party of India_ claim to have been founded
in 1925 had already crumbled and that there were acute
factional fights in it. The '_Indian Communist_' leadership
which is claimed to have been in existence in the those days
was incapable of utilizing the then existing conditions which
were favourable to the _Communist Party_ on account of the
developments that had taken place at the international and
national levels.

Efforts were made by the leadership of the _Communist
International_ to effect a fundamental change in this situation
and for the emergence of a unified Communist leadership in
India capable of unifying the _anti-imperialist_ forces in the
country. Representatives of the International came to India
several times, established contact with the different Communist
groups and gave suggestions on the basis of what they
understood the situation here, to reorganize the Party. The
International also published two draft documents concerning
"_Party Programme_" and "_Party Constitution_" with a view
to their unification.

Besides, the Communist Parties of Great Britain,
Germany and China jointly published an open letter
addressed to _Indian Communists_ pointing to the danger of
groupism and factionalism among _Indian Communists_ at a
time when the enemy class was caught in a deep crisis. These
were the efforts made by the _Communist International_ to
salvage the Party organisation which was existing, with weaknesses
though, from 1925 to 1929 from the grip of the
crisis following the developments in 1929.

These efforts did not produce any tangible result until
the accused in the Meerut case were released from prison
towards the end of 1933. Following the release of most of
the accused, a central leadership in its elementary form
emerged working within the framework suggested by the _Communist
International_ and assessing the changes current in
the Indian political situation. This central leadership continued
(with change of individuals) until the Party was split
in 1964. In this sense, it can be said that in spite of the
fruitless efforts made earlier, the successful formation of the
Party took place only in the year 1933--34. In other words, by 1934 the _Communist Party of India_ had come into being
outliving all the repressive actions for over a decade. The
rulers came to the conclusion that this challenge to the
imperialist rule as well as to the _bourgeois_ leadership in the
_anti-imperialist_ fighting front must be nipped in the bud.
That was why the same government which lifted the ban on
Congress which was moving from _civil disobedience_ to the
programme of participation in the legislature, had chosen to
ban the _Communist Party_ which was in a very weak state.

## NEW VERSIONS OF LEFT-WING CONGRESS

Earlier, we have dealt with the discontent among the
Congress ranks that arose out of the withdrawal of the _civil
disobedience movement_ in 1922 and the emergence of the
different political groups as a result of it. A somewhat
similar situation arose again when the _satyagraha_ movement,
both mass and individual, was withdrawn in 1933.

But the political situation in India in 1933--34 was vastly
different from what it was a decade ago, as evident from
the absence of the 'bomb politics'. Many of those who had
adopted the 'bomb politics' earlier and consequently undergone
imprisonment had realized its bankruptcy and had
turned to the path of revolutionary work based on the
masses of workers and peasants. In fact, a large section of
the activists of the 'Terrorist Movement' came out of jails in
the early years of the 1930s imbibing the ideologies of Communism
and Socialism.

Not only the former 'terrorists,' but a considerable
section among the ordinary _Congressmen_ also came out of
prisons conscious of the bankruptcy of the Gandhian method
of struggle and also of the need to reorient the
_freedom struggle_ towards Socialism or Communism. Thus,
it was in an atmosphere favourable for the growth of Socialist
and Communist ideologies that the _Communist Party of
India_ emerged with a perpetually functioning central leadership.

The leftist ideological trends now spread not only
among the ranks of the Congress, but also found reflected
on the leaders, Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Bose who
were the leaders with leftist ideological trends among the
Congress leadership towards the end of the 1920s, once
again appeared as the representatives of the new left trend in
the leadership. But as before, there was a basic difference --- even
a contradiction --- between the views held by them.

The rise of the Soviet Union and the growth of fascism
were the events which attracted the attention of the Congress
leaders as well as the ranks and the common people. But on
this issue, Nehru and Bose took mutually opposite positions.
It was this difference in approach that later on took Bose to
the camp of the fascist powers and Nehru to the _anti-fascist_
camp.

In the second half of 1933, Nehru was out of prison for
a few weeks. During this brief period, he wrote a series of
articles, entitled "_Whither India?_". The ideas he presented
through these articles received wide publicity. The central
point he brought out in these articles as well as through press
conferences was that the capitalist system on world scale
was cracking up and that the forces of Socialism were growing.
He added that it was to meet that situation that _Nazism_ in
Germany and other forms of authoritarian tendencies
were growing in a number of countries, including England.
Nehru stated that the world would have to choose either some
kind of Socialism or some kind of fascism and that there
was nothing in between the two.

Nehru made it clear that he had fundamental disagreement
on a number of things that were taking place in the
Soviet Union. He sharply criticized Communists and Socialists
in India and abroad. At the same time, he emphasized
that a variety of Socialism different from what was being
practised in the Soviet Union and preached by Communists
and Socialists elsewhere was the only way open before India.

Nehru had a deep aversion towards fascism and regarded
that the imperialist oppression to which India was
subjected was a kind of fascism. He, therefore, suggested
that India's struggle for freedom from British imperialism
must be linked to the world-wide struggle against fascism.

Almost during the same period, Bose wrote a book, entitled
_The Indian Struggle_. Like Nehru, Bose also examined
India's _freedom struggle_ in the contexts of the achievements
of the Socialist Soviet Union and the growth of fascism.
But unlike Nehru, he had no particular liking for Socialism
or hatred towards fascism, but found in the latter a challenge
to the imperialist powers. Contrary to Nehru's view of joining
the camp of Socialism, Bose advised his followers to adopt
a policy towards imperialist domination bringing a sort of
compromise between Socialism and fascism.

Apart from the general international issue of Communism
and Socialism, there was another question on which they
distinguished from each other. It concerns the approach
towards the Congress in general, and to its supremo, Gandhi,
in particular.

Although Nehru shared the feelings of Vithalbhai
Patel and Subhas Bose in regard to Gandhi's decision to
withdraw the _Satyagraha_ in 1933, he did not express the resentment
in public. He only wrote letters to Gandhi and
some of his close associates. While Nehru was out of prison
for a few weeks in 1933, he met Gandhi personally and held
discussions with him. These discussions were followed by
exchange of correspondence between them. These correspondence
showed that there was no fundamental differences
between the two.

Nehru often declared that he was a Socialist and wanted
the Congress to accept a programme of ending the interests
of the _bourgeois_-landlord classes and that yet he accepted
the leadership of Gandhi. Nehru interpreted the meaning of
_full independence_ as bringing the defence, foreign and economic
affairs under the control of Indians. He wished the overthrow
of the vested interests as "softly" and swiftly as
possible. He also insisted that the Indian freedom movement
should be linked with international problems.

Gandhi had no objection to all this. He had no objection
to Nehru holding any opinion on anything as long as he
was willing to accept his leadership and the discipline of the
Congress. It was in this background that Gandhi observed:

>I do not think that Jawaharlal's opinions have taken a clear
shape in such a way as to deviate fundamentally from the
policies of the Congress. He has firm belief in Socialism.
But as to how the Socialist ideas are to be implemented in
Indian situations, his ideas are yet to get crystallized. So,
his Communistic trends need not frighten anyone.

Nehru himself took the attitude that following his talks
with Gandhi, the differences of opinion between them need
not be exaggerated. Gandhi, on the other hand, stated that
the differences between them were rather in the realm of
personal approach and attitude than on fundamental ideology.
And he authorized Nehru to make declarations in
regard to the Congress policies.

Thus, Nehru continued to express publicly support to
Socialism and Communism as before, while he tried in practice
to remain loyal to the policies of Gandhi and other
Congress leaders.

There was a large section among the ordinary Congress
workers who, though distinct from both Nehru and Bose in
thinking, were closer to Nehru than to Bose. They formed a
separate organization called the _Congress Socialist Party_.
As the initial step in this direction, a preliminary meeting of
the _Congress Socialists_ was held at Patna in May 1934 to
coincide with the _AICC_ meeting held there. The meeting
reviewed the struggles of workers and peasants which were
in progress in the different parts of the country and discussed
the programmes of the Congress which was contemplating
to withdraw the _civil disobedience movement_ and to
enter in legislatures. At the end of the discussions, the
conference came to the conclusion that it was time for the
Socialists inside the Congress to start functioning as a separate
political party. It appointed a _Drafting Committee_ with
Jayaprakash Narain as convener to prepare a draft programme
and a draft constitution for the new party. The _Patna
Conference_ also decided to hold a broader conference at the
time and place of the annual session of the Congress in
order to adopt the draft documents and to elect a regular
_Executive Committee_.

In fact, even before this conference, provincial units of
the _Congress Socialist Party_ had been formed not only in
Bombay and Calcutta which were the main centres of activity
of Communists but also in several other provinces. In
Kerala, for example, a conference was held in Calicut under
the presidentship of K. Kelappan, in which a committee was
formed with CK Govindan Nair as President and P Krishna
Pillai as secretary. The present author along with
A Madhavan represented this committee in the _Patna
Conference_.

Although many left Congress workers like Acharya
Narendra Dev, Babu Sampurnanand and Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya
came up as spokespersons of the new party, it
was Jayaprakash Narain, MR Masani and others who
played a vital role in building the party as an organized
movement.

Many leaders of the newly reorganized _Communist
Party_ and the organization started by MN Roy and his
followers which had been functioning in many parts of the
country attended the _Patna Conference_ and participated in
its deliberations. All of them tried to orientate the new
party according to their own ideological perspectives. However,
all these attempts ended in failure. Contrary to the
proposals put forward by Communists and _Royists_, the
main trend of opinion that emerged in the Conference was
that since the _Indian National Congress_ was the principal
instrument of revolution in India, all Socialists must become
members of the Congress and strive to draw that organization
to the path of revolution. At the same time, as distinct
from the approach of Nehru, the Conference severely
criticized the Gandhian programme and the style of work of
the Congress under Gandhi's leadership.

The leaders of the party claimed that the _Congress
Socialist Party_ was striving to implement the ideas and
opinions expressed by Nehru while he was out of jail
for a few weeks in the second half of 1933. However, Nehru
himself stated later that his approach was distinct from that
of the _Congress Socialist Party_.

Nehru was not prepared for a clash with Gandhi and
other right-wing Congress leaders. He chose a style of functioning
of remaining in the Congress and giving its programmes
a Socialistic form. He wrote to many of his Communist
and Socialists friends stating that since the Congress was the
only developed revolutionary organization despite ideological
backwardness, what was needed was to provide it a new
revolutionary orientation rather than keeping aloof from it.
Therefore, he dissented the idea of forming a _Socialist Party_
within the Congress.

At the same time, Nehru felt angry when he learned
that the _Congress Working Committee_ adopted a resolution
against the newly formed _Socialist Party_. In a letter he
wrote to Gandhi from prison, Nehru severely criticized the
resolution and commented the 'amazing ignorance' of those
who wrote the resolution on subjects they were dealing with.
He added that it was as if the desire to assure the different
vested interests was determining the style of functioning of
_Working Committee_.

It was a time when many other trends of thought were
emerging among the left-wing _Congressmen_ in addition to
those of Nehru, Bose and the _Congress Socialist Party_ just
described. And it was the conflict among these different
trends of thought and the public opinion which took shape in
this conflict that determined the nature of Indian politics in
the second half of the 1930s.

## _CONGRESS NATIONALIST PARTY_

The formation of _Congress Nationalist Party_ under the
leadership of Pandit Malaviya and MS Aney constituted
another important event in Indian politics following the
suppression of the _civil disobedience movement_. This was
the manifestation of the growth of _rightist_ and the Hindu
communal trends in the Congress.

As we have noted earlier, there were reflections of
Hinduism as well as that of Islam in the freedom movement
right from its inception. These two communal trends fought
with each other on the question of the nature of independent
India. While the Hindu nationalists visualized the grandeur
of the ancient Hindu empires and its revival, the Muslim
nationalists fought the foreign rulers with nostalgia for the
grandeur of the _Delhi Sultanate_ and the _Mughal empire_.

These conflicting conceptions of the nature of Independent
India led to the formation of Muslim political parties
like the _Muslim League_, on the one side, and _Hindu Mahasabha_,
on the other. Although there were occasions of
agreement between them, most often there were conflicts and
contradictions between them. And, as we know, the British
rulers always made clever use of these conflicts and contradictions.
It may be recalled that it was mainly with the
help of communal and caste politics that the rulers were
able to isolate Gandhi, the sole representative of the Congress
in the _Second Round Table Conference_. However,
Gandhi's fast and the settlement reached on the question of
_Harijan_ representation in the legislatures helped the Congress
to make a small dent in the opposition combine built against
the Congress.

The British scheme of representation to the different
communities in the Central and provincial legislatures came
into force, although with alterations in the case of the _Harijans_.
The British rulers contemplated to introduce _constitutional
reforms_ in India by incorporating what was known
as the '_Communal Award_'. That is, the forthcoming _constitutional
reforms_ were fairly gratifying to all the communities
except the Hindus for whom they were disappointing.
Therefore, the question came up before the Congress as to
what should be its attitude towards the reforms and whether
it should accept or reject them. This would form a major issue
in the elections to the Central legislature scheduled to be held
before the end of 1934. What stand the Congress should
take before approaching the people in the elections?

On this issue there were differences of opinion in the
Congress between Pandit Malaviya, Aney and others on the
one hand, and the majority in the Congress, on the other.
Malaviya and Aney argued for a total rejection of the
_Communal Award_ on the ground that it was a scheme designed
by the rulers to foster communal feelings and to destroy
nationalism. A majority of the Congress leaders agreed with
this view. A resolution adopted by the _Working Committee_
which met on 17th and 18th June 1934 in Bombay stated:

>The White paper in no way expresses the will of the people
of India, has been more or less condemned by almost all
the Indian political parties and falls far short of the Congress
goal, if it does not retard the progress towards it.
The only satisfactory alternative to the White Paper is a
constitution drawn up by a _Constituent Assembly_ elected
on the basis of adult suffrage or as near it as possible,
with the power, if necessary, to the important minorities
to have their representatives elected exclusively by the
electors belonging to such minorities.

Here, the Congress is not rejecting or accepting the
_Communal Award_ in isolation, but rejecting the whole scheme
of _constitutional reforms_. With the rejection of the scheme,
the _Communal Award_ automatically stands rejected. The
resolution continued:

>Among other things, it will be the duty of the _Constituent
Assembly_ to determine the method of representation of
important minorities and make provisions fur otherwise
safeguarding their interests.

The _Working Committee_ knew that this was not an easy
task, for there were serious differences of opinion among
the different communities with regard to the _Communal
Award_. The resolution stated: "The Congress claims to
represent equally all the communities composing the Indian
nation and therefore, in view of the division of opinion, can
neither accept nor reject the _Communal Award_ as long as
the division of opinion lasts." The resolution asserted:

>No solution that is not purely national can be propounded
>by the Congress. But the Congress is pledged to accept
>any solution falling short of the national, which is agreed
>to by all the parties concerned and, conversely to reject
>any solution which is not agreed to by any of the said parties.
>Judged by this national standard, the _Communal Award_
>is wholly unsatisfactory, besides being open to serious
>objections on other grounds.
>
>It is, however, obvious that the only way to prevent
>untoward consequences of the _Communal Award_ is to
>explore _ways and means_ of arriving at an agreed solution
>and not by any appeal on this essentially domestic question
>to the British Government or any other outside authority.

This resolution created discontent among the _Congressmen_
with Hindu outlook like Malaviya and Aney. Prolonged
discussions took place between them and those representing
the majority of the _Working Committee_. Gandhi himself
took the initiative to resolve the differences and put forward
certain suggestions. Dissatisfied with all this, Malaviya and
Aney resigned from the Congress _Parliamentary Board_. Aney
who was a member of the _Working Committee_ resigned that
position also.

Following, Malaviya and Aney took the initiative to
convene a meeting of those _Congressmen_ who were in disagreement
with the _Working Committee_ resolution on
_Communal Award_. At the meeting held in Calcutta, a new
party called _Congress Nationalist Party_ was formed which
decided to call for a country-wide agitation against the reforms
scheme including the _Communal Award_. It also decided
to contest the ensuing elections independently in such a way
as to materialize its objective. Efforts were also made to
make the Congress revise its decision by urging to call
for a meeting of the _AICC_ to decide whether to approve or
reject the _Working Committee_ resolution.

This appeal was rejected on the ground that the election
to the _AICC_ was due, since the party had regained legality
and that a newly elected _AICC_ itself was to meet shortly.
It was also pointed out that members could, in accordance
with the Congress constitution, call for a requisitioned meeting
of the _AICC_ in which case necessary actions would be
taken to hold a meeting.

Subsequently, a Congress session was held in Bombay
towards the end of october 1934, which witnessed a keen
debate on the _Communal Award_. Malaviya and Aney vigorously
argued against the _Working Committee_ resolution, but
their arguments were rejected with an overwhelming majority.

As the _Working Committee_ resolution neither accepting
nor rejecting the _Communal Award_ was approved, the
leaders of the _Congress Nationalist Party_ decided to conduct
their activities in an organized manner in protest against the
decision of the Congress. The Party put up its own candidates
to contest the elections to the Central Assembly held in
November 1934 and won 11 seats against 44 for the Congress.

There are also certain other facts which are of equal
significance. The Congress leadership decided against putting
up candidates against Malaviya and Aney. The leadership
also decided not to contest the elections in the province of
Sind and in Calcutta City where the _Hindu Mahasabha_
had considerable following. Thus, the _Nationalist Party_
candidates were elected with the indirect support of the
Congress. After the election, the _Nationalist Party_ cooperated
with the Congress in the Assembly on all issues except the
_Communal Award_.

The emergence of the _Congress Nationalist Party_ demonstrated
the weakness of the political line pursued by the
_bourgeois_ leadership of the Congress. Despite the claim
made by the Congress that it was the organization which
equally represented all communities, the rulers had been
able to rally most of the non-Hindu communities against it.
They could also carry with them for long even the _Harijan_
community among the Hindus which could be won back only
by Gandhi's fast and his _Harijan_ upliftment programme.

Now, the Hindus other than the _Harijans_ had raised
the banner of protest against the Congress, or rather against
its "policy of appeasement of the Muslims". Not only those
leaders who had played significant roles in the growth of
the Congress and participated in the _civil disobedience
movement_, but also many provinces and regions had registered
their protest against the Congress. It had become
obvious that a fight against the _Muslim League_ and other
parties of the minority communities on the one side, and
against Hindu nationalism represented by the _Congress
Nationalist Party_ on the other, was a condition for the very
existence of the Congress.

The Congress, in fact, handled the different issues such
as the _Salt Satyagraha_, _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_, the _Second Round
Table Conference_, and _Second civil disobedience_ on the
premise that it represented the entire Indian people and that
Gandhi was its undisputed leader. But the _Second Round
Table Conference_ revealed that the Congress did not have
as much influence on the people as it had claimed. The emergence
of the _Congress Nationalist Party_ and the policy the
Congress had to adopt towards it showed that a considerable
section among the Hindus was against the Congress policy
of "appeasement" of the Muslims.

Side by side, the position Gandhi had been enjoying in
the Congress began to show erosion. The _Swaraj Party_
formed under the leadership of Dr. Ansari and others, the
_Congress Socialist Party_ formed by leftist _Congressmen_, the
opinion expressed independently by such outstanding individuals
like Vittalbhai Patel, Subhas Bose and Jawaharlal
Nehru differing from the Gandhian approach were all indications
to il. In other words, different trends of thought and
views and different organized political groups began to emerge
within the national movement which was once represented
solely by the Congress.

The last to appear on the scene was the trend of thought
represented by the _Congress Nationalist Party_ led by Malaviya
and Aney, whose influence was felt right inside the
Congress. This together with the activities of the leaders
of the caste and communal politics were instrumental to the
division of the country into Indian Union and Pakistan in the
wake of the attainment of independence in 1947 and to the
tragedies that took place subsequently.

## ANTI-LEFT GANDHIAN MANIFESTO

In the middle of 1934, a rumour spread throughout the
country that Gandhi was going to give up even his primary
membership and retire from the Congress.

The basis of the rumour was a talk Gandhi had with
some of his close friends and associates. Gandhi revealed
to them his desire to devote himself to the _constructive programme_
dear to him, rather than continuing the active
leadership of the Congress, and to leave the day-to-day
political activities to his able and talented colleagues. Gradually
the rumour reached the ears of the pressmen and
consequently received wide publicity in the newspapers.

As things had become public, Gandhi thought it appropriate
to issue a statement explaining the whole issue. Accordingly,
on 17th September Gandhi issued a lengthy statement
which evoked a wide range of emotions among the people.
In the statement Gandhi said that he discussed the issue with
his colleagues holding different points of view when they had
come to attend the _Working Committee_ and _Parliamentary
Board_ meetings at Wardha. Some of them disagreed with
him on the idea of resignation of his primary membership
and some others advised him to retain the membership but
keep away from the active leadership of the Congress. Yet
some others expressed their opinion in favour of resignation.
Gandhi stated that after considering these views he decided
to postpone a final decision till after the Congress session
which was scheduled to be held in October. With this introduction,
Gandhi stated:

>It has appeared to me that there is a growing and vital
difference of outlook between many _Congressmen_ and
myself. I seem to be going in a direction just opposite of
what many of the most intellectual _Congressmen_ would
gladly and enthusiastically take if they were not hampered
by their unexempled loyalty to me. No leader can expect
greater loyalty and devotion than I have received from intellectually
minded _Congressmen_, even when they have
protested and signified their disapproval of the policies
I have laid for the Congress. For me anymore to draw
upon their loyalty and devotion is to put undue strain upon
them. Their loyalty cannot blind my eyes to what appear
to me to be fundamental differences between the Congress
_intelligentsia_ and me.

What were the differences? Hand-spinning and handweaving
_Khadi_ were matters of vital importance to Gandhi.
It was an accepted programme of the Congress and one of
the important clauses in its constitution. Hence, the _Congressmen_
were formally implementing it. But a considerable
section of them really had no faith in this programme and
in this clause of the Congress constitution.

For Gandhi the _Khadi_ programme could not be considered
as an activity in isolation of other questions. It is a part of
the _constructive programme_ of giving a new life to the
decaying and the decadent village industries, and with it,
working for the upliftment of _Harijans_ and for Hindu-Muslim
unity. The _Khadi_ programme occupies a central place in
his political perspective of developing the organized strength
of the people and making their struggles _non-violent_. According
to Gandhi, since the Congress had accepted it as a
programme, _Congressmen_ used to implement it. But they had
no full faith in it. For him, however, it is the lifeblood.

It is clear that this is a new version of rift between Gandhi's
disciples and other Congress leaders that had developed a
decade ago following the withdrawal of the _civil disobedience
movement_ of 1921--22. But there is a significant difference
between the situation prevailing then and now. Then it was
mainly the _Swaraj Party_ that had come up against the Gandhian
leadership. But Gandhi's outlook and programme
were seemingly more revolutionary as compared to theirs.
Then the clash was between Gandhi who, wiping out the
earlier 'moderate' politics, led the Congress along the path of
_direct action_ and the _Swaraj Party_ which was trying to bring
the Congress back to the 'moderate' politics. Leftist political
outlook including that of Socialism and Communism was
very weak at that time.

By 1934, however, a solid Socialist group had emerged,
in the Congress itself. Also, outside this group, there was a
considerable number of _Congressmen_ with leftist outlook.
Now, two principal groups had emerged, a new version of the
old _Swaraj Party_, and a Socialist group and other left-oriented
individuals. Consequently, the struggle now was between
these main groups among Gandhi's colleagues on the one
hand, and Gandhi's disciples on the other.

Among these, Gandhi's attitude towards the Socialists is
meaningful. In his statement Gandhi said:

>I have welcomed the formation of the Socialist group.
Many of them are respected and self-sacrificing workers.
With all this, I have fundamental differences with them as
the programme published in their authorised pamphlets.
But I would not, by reason of the moral pressure I may
be able to exert, suppress the spread of ideas propounded
in their literature. I may not interfere with the free
expression of these ideas, however distasteful some of them
may be to me. If they gain ascendancy in the Congress,
as they well may, I cannot remain in the Congress. For
to be in active opposition should be unthinkable. Though
identified with many organizations during a long period of
public service, I have never accepted that position.

Clearly, what was disturbing Gandhi mainly was the
growing strength of Socialist thinking and the general Socialist
outlook within the Congress. Besides, he also mentioned
specifically certain other things in his statement, One of
them concerned the _Princely States_. Gandhi had been
maintaining all along the view that the Congress should not
interfere with the internal affairs of the _Princely States_,
meaning thereby that the Congress should not support the
_people's struggle_ against the autocratic rule in these states.
A powerful movement against this had been growing within
the Congress. One of the issues raised by the _Congress
Socialist Party_ was the attitude of the Congress towards the
struggles for democracy in the _Princely States_. Gandhi said:

>I have given many an anxious hour to the question, but
I have not been able to alter my view.

Gandhi also pointed out that there was a serious difference
of opinion between him and many of his colleagues on
the question of untouchability:

>Even on untouchability, my method of approach is perhaps
different from that of many, if not most _Congressmen_.
For me, it is a deeply religious and moral issue. Many
think that it was a profound error for me to have disturbed
the course of civil resistance struggle by taking up
the question in the manner, and at the time, I did. I feel
that I would have been untrue to myself if I had taken
any other course.

On the question of the objective of '_full independence_'
also Gandhi's views differed from those of his colleagues.
Gandhi considered _full independence_ an idea which was not
strictly definable. For him, _full independence_ achieved by
giving up the means of _truth and non-violence_ which he held
fast was no independence at all. He believed that the objective
of _full independence_ was inseparable from the means
based on _truth and non-violence_. Many of his colleagues,
on the other hand, believed that any means was acceptable
to a desirable objective.

Each of these issues was raised in the Congress by
_Congress Socialists_, Communists and other leftists. Obviously,
Gandhi was disturbed at the growing trend of thought
that an uncompromising struggle in which the people of the
_Princely States_ should be brought in should be conducted
against British imperialism, crossing the bounds of _non-violence_.
Since it was the _Congress Socialist Party_ as a group
in the congress, which was working with such a perspective,
he simply mentioned that Party in particular and said that
he would not be able to continue in the Congress if the
_Congress Socialists_ gained ascendancy in the Congress.
What disturbed him was not the general Socialist thinking,
but the increasing readiness for the struggle and the programme
in accordance with it.

Gandhi was unable to get along with the programme of
parliamentary activities, either. His statement added:

>Though the author of _Non-cooperation_, I am convinced
that in the present circumstances of the country and in
the absence of any general scheme of civil resistance, a
_Parliamentary Party_ within the Congress is a necessary part
of any programme that may be framed by the Congress,
but there are sharp differences of opinion among us on
that point. The force with which I urged the programme
at the _All-India Congress Committee_ meeting in
Patna, I know, oppressed many of our best colleagues, but
they hesitated to act according to their own conviction.

Needless to say, here also Gandhi blessed the right-wing
_Congressmen_ against the leftists. The right-wing appeared
on the scene with the programme of contesting the elections
as part of the parliamentary work, fighting the parliamentary
battle in the legislatures and utilizing that opportunity to
bargain with the British for '_full independence_' which "was
not strictly defined". As opposed to this, the leftists were
striving to put up a fight inside the Congress to rally the entire
people including those in the _Princely States_ in an uncompromising
struggle against the British.

Gandhi placed the resignation proposal before the people
through the statement which expressed favour towards the
former and opposition to the latter.

It is doubtful if the _AICC_ would have adopted the parliamentary
programme, had it not been "forcefully urged
upon" by Gandhi. Gandhi's direct support was also needed
to get the decision of the _AICC_ approved by the Congress
session. Also, Gandhi's leadership was essential until the next
Congress session for the rightwing to gain a sure victory
on the several issues powerfully raised by Communists,
Socialists and other leftists.

But, once this programme was adopted and the Congress
won the forthcoming elections, these two sections in the
Congress could be left free to confront each other; Gandhi's
intervention in it would not serve any useful purpose; so it
will be better to leave them free to fight each other. This
was the idea.

Even in this fight, the existing organizational form of
the Congress was not favourable to the right-wing. For
Gandhi who had made the 'moderate'-led Congress to adopt
the line of mass politics, had built up an organization to suit
that purpose. Any Indian citizen who accepted the objectives
of the Congress and paid the membership subscription of
four _annas_ was entitled to become a member of the Congress
and all the _Congress Committees_ from bottom to top were
to be elected by these members. It was on these principles
that Gandhi re-organized the Congress. This organizational
form was then fully suited to the Gandhian politics, the
characteristic features of which were _non-violent_ mass
struggle and attempts to negotiate as an integral part of it.
However, the emergence and growth of the left views among
the Congress ranks and the masses of the people constituted
a powerful challenge to the Gandhian ideology and style of
work. Now the situation was such that the mass organization
which Gandhi had utilized for over a decade was likely to
cross the bounds set by his ideology and objectives. This
was the apprehension that Gandhi expressed through the
phrase "If they gain ascendancy in the Congress, as they
well may".

Therefore, in the statement of 17th September, Gandhi
proposed certain resolutions to be placed before the Subject
Committee in order to "test the feelings of the Congress"
on the points he had touched upon in the statement. The
final decision he would take on the question of resignation
from the Congress would depend on the decision of the
Congress session on the points he had raised.

In brief, Gandhi's statement was a manifesto, couched
in the language of morality and religiosity characteristic
of him, against the leftist movement which was rapidly
growing inside the Congress. Consequently, the Bombay
session of the Congress in October 1934 turned out to be a
scene of confrontation between the left and right within
the Congress.

## THE BOMBAY SESSION

Immediately before the commencement of tho Bombay
session of the Congress and in the same venue, the founding
conference of the _Congress Socialist Party_ was held. The
conference approved the policy statements and constitution
prepared by the _Drafting Committee_ which was appointed
at the Patna conference held in May.

Explaining the aims and objects of the _Congress Socialist
Party_, the policy statement made it clear that it was a
Party of Socialists working within the Congress and striving
to draw the Congress to the path of Socialism. Therefore,
it was the task of the _Congress Socialist_ to become member
of the Congress and fight for Socialist ideas inside the Congress,
while, at the same time, working in trade unions,
peasant organizations and such other class organizations and
participating in the agitations and struggles being conducted
by these organizations.

That is, the _Congress Socialists_ must work keeping it in
mind that, politically, Congress was their main field of
activities.

There were large numbers of _Congress Socialists_ among
the delegates to the Bombay session of the Congress from
most states. This was true of the members elected to the
_AICC_ also. About a half or even more of the number of
delegates from Kerala, United Provinces and certain other
provinces were _Congress Socialists_.

For this and also for the reason that intense debates
were going on across the country on the 17th September statement
of Gandhi, one of the important subjects discussed in
the _Congress Socialist_ conference was the attitude to be taken
at the Congress session. In addition to the _Congress Socialists_,
certain other leftist groups also discussed the attitudes
the respective groups had to take in the Congress session.
The leaders of some of these groups, particularly those of
_Communist Party_ and the _Royist group_, had participated in
the _Congress Socialist_ conference.

In addition, there were independent left-wing _Congressmen_
raising voice against the Gandhian ideology and the
right-wing leadership which was eager to enter in legislatures.
Efforts were made to unify the activities of all these parties,
groups and individuals and build a powerful fighting front
against the _rightist_ leadership both in the _AICC_ and in the
Congress session. And these efforts yielded considerable
success.

Gandhi's statement of 17th September was a sharp
weapon that the right-wing could readily use against the
left. The organizational proposals contained in Gandhi's
statement came up before the Congress session in the form
of amendments to the Congress constitution. Naturally,
each of these amendments was keenly debated both in the
_AICC_ and in the general session.

Since the right-wing leadership backed by Gandhi had
commanded a majority, the amendments to the constitution
and the resolutions embodying these ideas were adopted.
However, there was a sizeable minority against these amendments
and resolutions. Besides, as the debates and the voting
pattern indicated, some acknowledged leaders were sympathetic
to the left.

The amendments to the Congress constitution was based
on Gandhi's conclusion that corruption had crept in the
organizational work of the Congress and that the existing
conferences and committees were not suited to the smooth
functioning of the organization. It may be noted that Gandhi
had pointed in the statement to "the growing corruption in our
ranks."

The basis of this complaint was the widespread practice
of spending money to enrol bogus members in order to
capture the organization. Besides, the Congress had become
a chaotic organization as a result of unrestrained enrolment
of membership, and the way of selecting delegates to conferences
and forming Congress committees at different levels.
The aim of Gandhi and the right-wing leadership was to
overcome this defects and reorganize the Congress through
these amendments.

The _Congress Socialists_ and other left-wing _Congressmen_
forcefully opposed these moves in the _AICC_ and in the
general conference.

The leftists could not, of course, deny the existence of
bogus membership and the resulting corruption in some
places. They, however, pointed out that this was only a
half-truth. Although it might provide opportunity for the
rich to capture the organization, the prevailing organizational
set up also provided opportunity to the masses of workers,
peasants and other working people to participate actively
in the activities of the Congress. It also enabled the leftists
who had earned the confidence of the masses through their
work among the masses to occupy prominent positions in
the Congress committees at various levels.

There were certain provincial committees, as that of
Kerala, and district committees in which the leftists had a
majority. That was why Gandhi, visualizing the possibility
of the Socialists gaining "ascendancy in the Congress, as
they may well", emphatically stated in his statement that he
could not remain in the Congress. The leftist _Congressmen_
including the _Congress Socialists_ argued in one voice that
the purpose of bringing amendments to the Congress constitution
was to prevent that "danger".

The first amendment to the constitution was to substitute
the phrase "truthful and _non-violent_" for "legitimate and
peaceful" in article I of the existing constitution which read:

>The objective of _Indian National Congress_ is the attainment
of _Purna Swaraj_ (_complete independence_) by all legitimate and
peaceful means.

On the surface , it may appear that Gandhi's aim was to
make the Congress accept his spiritual-religious outlook.
But the leftists regarded that the targets of Gandhi's attack
were, in reality, the method of agitations and struggles of
workers, peasants and other toiling masses and the outlook
of the leftist parties which were leading these agitations and
struggles. According to Gandhi, in the mass struggles of 1921--22 and 1932--33, there were many incidents which went
against the principle of _non-violence_. Gandhi had often
complained that the congress leaders did not stand by him
in opposing such acts.

Gandhi had stated that _non-violence_ that ought to be a
"creed" was only a "policy" for "the majority of _Congressmen_".
The left wing _Congressmen_ argued that Gandhi
and the right-wing leadership led by him were striving to
change the situation by making the Congress organization
adopt _non-violence_ as a creed applicable to all _Congressmen_
and that if this were adopted by the organization, the Congress
would lose the status of a political organization based
on mass struggles.

The second and third amendments were of similar
nature. According to the constitution in force, any adult
who accepted the object of the Congress and paid four
_annas_ was entitled to become a member of the Congress.
It was these "four _anna_ members" who elected the Congress
committees at all levels and also the delegates to the provincial
and all-India conferences. In its place, Gandhi suggested
certain amendments incorporating qualifications restraining
the rights of members to vote and get elected, as follows:

>The second amendment would be to replace the four _annas_
franchise by the delivery by every member to a Congress
depot of 2,000 rounds (one round equals to four feet) per
month of well twisted even yarn of not less than 15 counts
spun by himself or herself. ... The third amendment
I should propose would be that no one shall be entitled to
vote at any Congress election whose name has not been on
the Congress register continuously for six months without
default, and who has not been a habitual wearer wholly
of khadar for that period.

These proposals also came up in the form of amendments
to the constitution in the _AICC_ and the general session.
Naturally, they also came under attack form the left. They
argued that it was wrong to prescribe the Gandhian code of
behaviour as qualification for the members of an organization
conducting agitations and struggles against the British rule
and the vested interests of landlords and others who support
the rule, rather than the courage and the sense of self-sacrifice
they exhibit while participating in the struggles. However,
as in the case of other amendments, these were also
adopted with Gandhi's support.

But the most important amendment which effected distortion
in the nature of the Congress as a mass organization
was one which was intended to reduce the number of members
in the _Congress Committees_ at different levels and also
in the number of delegates attending the Congress session.
This amendment, if adopted, would help only to extinguish
the spirit and enthusiasm of the masses and tens of thousands
of Congress workers who were entering the organization, to
the advantage of the right-wing leadership. So, the left-wing
fought a fierce battle against this amendment, too.

Although the _AICC_ and the Congress session adopted
all these amendments, Gandhi stood firm on his decision to
resign form the Congress. Hence, the Congress session passed
the following resolution:

>This Congress reiterates its confidence in the leadership of
_Mahatma Gandhi_ and is emphatically of the opinion that
he should reconsider his decision to retire from the Congress.
But inasmuch as all efforts to persuade him in that
behalf have failed, this Congress, while reluctantly accepting
his decision places on record its deep sense of
gratitude for the unique service rendered by him to the
Nation and notes with satisfaction his assurance that his
advice and guidance will be available to the Congress
whenever necessary.

This was an unprecedented event in the history of the
Congress. Gandhi who gave leadership to the Congress for
about a decade and a half would cease to be formally associated
with it. But the Congress leadership could approach him
whenever they felt that his advice and leadership were needed.
He would gladly accept such a request. And the leaders
would certainly seek his advice and leadership whenever a
serious problem arose before them, for they were the kind
of people who had got all the amendments proposed by
Gandhi in his statement adopted by the _AICC_ and the
Congress session.

Why did Gandhi decide finally to resign and retire from
the Congress even after the Congress accepted all the proposals
put forward by him ? Why did the right-wing leadership
accept, reluctantly though, his resignation ?

In order to find an answer to these questions, it is
necessary to consider two other resolutions adopted by the
Bombay session of the Congress.

One of these resolutions relates to the decision to form
_All-India Village Industries Association_ (_Gramodyog Sangh_)
in addition to the existing _Spinners' Association_ (_Charkha
Sangh_) and the _Harijan Seva Sangh_.

The second resolution was intended to give permanency
to the Congress _Parliamentary Board_ which was originally
instituted as an emergency measure, and to make it an integral
part of the Congress organization. These resolutions
together would affect a division of labour between Gandhi
and his disciples on the one hand, and those right-wing
Congress leaders who wanted to engage themselves fully in
parliamentary activities on the other. That is, the _constructive
activities_' through _Gramodyog Sangh_, _Charkha Sangh_
and _Harijan Seva Sangh_ would go on under the direct leadership
of Gandhi, while the other leaders would be free to
carry on with the political-organizational activities, including
parliamentary activities. Whenever need arises for conducting
_satyagraha_ or other forms of _direct actions_, Gandhi would
appear on the scene.

There is yet another question. What was the need for
such a division of labour between Gandhi and the right-wing
_Congressmen_? In order to find an answer to this question, it
is necessary to keep in mind the truth that the left forces in
the Congress was growing and had started posing danger to
the right-wing leadership.

The right-wing leadership had already gained the necessary
strength to "keep the leftists at their proper place" even
without the direct leadership of Gandhi and the Bombay
session had done the job of reorganizing the Congress in such
a way as to make use of this position against the left. If
the leftists continue to gain strength despite all this, then
Gandhi would appear on the scene. We shall see later on
that this was exactly what had happened when Subhas Bose
was elected president of the congress in 1939 as the candidate
of the leftists.

Thus, the Bombay session entrusted the _rightist_ leadership
with the day-to-day activities and leadership providing
it an opportunity to confront the left without the direct intervention
of Gandhi. The right-wing leaders including Gandhi
were convinced that these were the effective ways of facing
the leftists.

## ELECTIONS TO CENTRAL ASSEMBLY

Immediately after the Bombay session, leaders and the
delegates to the session had to face elections to the Central
Assembly. The entire organization had to be geared up by
drawing into the field tens of thousands of workers who had
faced imprisonment and police repression for having waged
a struggle for over two and a half years to show that their
acts of self-sacrifice did not go in vain.

Not only the Congress but other parties and the government
looked upon the elections as an opportunity to convince
the people of the correctness of the respective positions taken
by them and to win people's support. The Hindu nationalists
led by Malaviya and Anney who had left the Congress and
founded the _Nationalist Party_, and the Muslim nationalists led
by Jinnah were in agreement with the Congress on all issues
except the government's decision on communal representation.

On the contrary, the _Justice Party_ in South India and
similar parties in other provinces, which were opposed to the
mass struggles led by the Congress and supported by the British,
were determined to defeat the Congress in the elections.
They were rendered all assistance at the official level. For
example, the election in the constituency reserved for merchants
of South India represented an officially supported
challenge to the Congress. Shanmugom Chetty was the merchants
candidate who had close links with British capitalists
sacrificing the interests of even the Indian _bourgeoisie_. Therefore,
it was essential for the Congress to defeat him. The
Congress nominated Swami Venkatachalam Chetty as its
official candidate. The nationalists threw the entire weight
behind him and the supporters of the British behind
Shanmugom Chetty. In the fierce election battle, the Congress
candidate was elected.

Similarly, the candidates nominated by the Congress
and those of the supporters of the British confronted
each other all over the country. Although the Congress
registered great success, in Bengal the candidates of the
_Congress Nationalist Party_ were returned in large numbers.
Similarly, in Punjab and in the constituencies reserved for
Muslims in other provinces, independent candidates' led by
Jinnah won a majority of seats. Thus, the combined strength
of the Congress, the _Congress Nationalist Party_ and the
independents under Jinnah constituted a majority of
elected members in the Central Assembly. They won 44, 11 and 19 seats, respectively, while three seats were won by
independents who were not attached to any of the three
groups. In addition, there were 11 members representing
the Europeans and 13 nominated official members, in the
Assembly. Thus, against 53 European, nominated official
and non-official members, there were 74 members belonging
to the Congress, the _Nationalist Party_ and the independent
group led by Jinnah which differed with each other only on
the question of communal representation. That is, in the
Central Assembly which was constituted after the elections,
those forces which were determined to defeat the anti-Indian
policies of the British had a formal majority.

Since the only thing which prevented these forces from
joining hands against the policies of the British rulers was
the difference over communal representation. efforts were
made to resolve this issue. On 23rd January 1935, Congress
President Rajendra Prasad and the _Muslim League_ President
Jinnah met and discussed the subject. These talks, however,
did not bring any positive result. Therefore, the three
groups which took a unified attitude on many issues and
cast vote in unison against the government, took mutually
opposing attitudes on many other issues.

A very important issue had come up in the meantime,
which made the mutually opposing positions of the three
groups pertinent. We have referred earlier to the _constitutional
reforms_ Bill introduced in the British Parliament incorporating
certain proposals put forward by the government,
which was referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee.
The report of the Committee was published a few days after
the elections to the Center Assembly. Since this report was
to determine the final shape of the Bill, it became incumbent
on each party and group to explain its position
in relation to the report.

The _Congress Working Committee_ which met in December 1934 examined the report and decided to reject it. The
Committee was of the opinion that in several respects the
report was worse than the draft proposals put forward by
the government earlier. Therefore, the _Working Committee_
demanded formation of a _Constituent Assembly_ to draw up
a constitution for India in place of the _constitutional reforms_
proposals designed to perpetuate the exploitation of India
by the British through their continued domination. Consequently,
the _Working Committee_ directed that it was the
responsibility of the newly elected Congress members in the
Assembly to get the Joint Parliamentary Committee report
rejected by the Assembly and to raise the demand for the
formation of a new _Constituent Assembly_.

The _Nationalist Party_ and the Jinnah group were in
agreement with the Congress on one important aspect of this
issue. But, as stated earlier, both were opposed to the
Congress, though from different angles, on the question of
communal representation. Besides, Jinnah was not prepared
to join hands with the Congress in demanding a _constituent
assembly_. The results of these divergent stands found expression
in the proceedings of the Central Assembly.

Bhulabhai Desai, leader of the Congress members in
the Assembly introduced a resolution in the Assembly
rejecting the Joint Parliamentary Committee's report. This
resolution was rejected only because the nominated official
and non-official members voted against it. Excluding the
European members, _Congressmen_ constituted a majority (44
out of 77) among the elected members. The government had
given direction to the nominated members to vote against
the resolution sponsored by the Congress members.

Jinnah also had introduced a separate resolution on this
subject. The opening section of the resolution sought the
approval of the Assembly to the scheme of communal representation
despite the inadequacies, until an alternative scheme
was proposed in agreement with the different communities
concerned. Although the Congress and the Congress Nationalist
members opposed the resolution, it was adopted by
Assembly with the support of nominated members.

Jinnah's resolution contained two more sections. With
the support of the Congress and _Nationalist Party_, these
sections were adopted by the Assembly with 74 votes against 53.

One of these sections was concerned with provisions
relating to provincial administration contained in the reforms
proposal. The resolution characterized these provisions
most unsatisfactory and disappointing. The resolution also
pointed out that the proposal contained several objectionable
provisions such as the institution of Upper House in the
provinces, special emergency powers to the Governor and
those with regard to the police and intelligence department,
as a result of which the control of the legislature on the
executive would be ineffective. The resolution emphatically
stated that unless these provisions were removed from the
proposals, it would not satisfy any section of Indian public
opinion.

The other section in the resolution relates to the administration
at the Centre or the _All-India Federation_. Characterizing
the provisions relating to this as "fundamentally bad"
the resolution recommended to the Indian Government not to
proceed with legislation based on the proposal. It also recommended
to examine the ways of establishing a really and fully
_responsible government_ exclusive to British India (_i.e._,
excluding the _Princely States_) and to take all necessary steps
without delay to "review the whole position in consultation
with Indian opinion".

With this it became clear that, although there were
differences of opinion on the question of communal representation,
the entire India _bourgeoisie_ was standing unitedly
behind the struggle against the _constitutional reforms_ proposed
by the British government. The government spokesmen
themselves were convinced of the fact that the main thrust of
Jinnah's resolution was against the British rule.

Thus, the floor of the Assembly became a scene of clash
between the government on the one hand, and the opposition
comprising the Congress, _Congress Nationalist Party_ and
the Jinnah group on the other. However, communal representation
remained as an issue which was helpful for the rulers
to divide the opposition.

The united action of the opposition was not confined
to the question of _constitutional reforms_, it also defeated
the government on a number of other issues in the first session
of the new Assembly. The debate and voting on the railway
budget deserve special mention here in this connection.
Bhulabhai Desai moved a resolution rejecting the railway
budget presented by the government. The _Nationalist Party_
and the Jinnah group voted for the resolution which was
adopted with 74 votes against 47. In another voting on the
railway budget, the opposition mustered as many as 81 votes
against 44 in favour of the government.

A number of other issues in which the _bourgeoisie_ was
interested also came up before the Assembly and on all such
issues the opposition stood united. This shattered the hopes
of the rulers to keep the Assembly subservient to them by
utilizing the differences that existed among the _bourgeois_
leadership on the question of communal representation. It
became clear that despite the differences, the _bourgeois_
leadership would remain united and fight to protect its class
interests and that the legislature would be utilized fully for
that purpose.

At the same time, it also became clear that the claim
made by Gandhi at the time of _Salt Satyagraha_ and in the
_Second Round Table Conference_ that Congress was the sole
representative of the Indian people was false. The elections
and the work in the Assembly showed that the differences on
the question of communal representation not only continued
to persist in the _bourgeois_ leadership but had spread to the
masses. Further, as evident from the results of the elections,
both the Hindus and the Muslims in the Muslim majority
provinces were against the Congress. As shown by the
proceedings of the Assembly, the Hindu-Muslim communal
outlook represented by the _Nationalist Party_ and the Jinnah
group had become a challenge which the Congress had to
face both inside and outside the legislature.

It must be stated specifically here that there was another
aspect of the growing co-operation among the Congress,
the _Nationalist Party_ and the Jinnah group. This was the
fact that the politics they were handling was not one of
mass struggle but of consultations and compromises at the
level of legislature and in the areas related to it.

The Jinnah group had no tradition of participation even
in the _people's struggles_ started by Gandhi in the 1920--21
period, leave alone the tradition of the new leftist political
tendencies. The leaders of the _Nationalist Party_, on the
other hand, had never identified themselves with Gandhian
programmes of struggle. They were handling politics with
the outlook of the old '_moderatism_'. What is more, even
the Congress members in the legislature were those who had
been striving to strengthen the right-wing forces against the
leftist political outlook that had begun to emerge within their
own organization. That is, what was found in the new
Assembly was a united opposition bloc of the _bourgeois_
leadership working in the legislature and in other related areas
in order to protect its own class interests.

A confrontation between these forces and the left forces
which were steadily growing in the Congress became inevitable.
And what was witnessed in the period between 1939 and
the outbreak of the Second World War was this confrontation.
As we are going to see, this assumed at a certain stage in 1939 as an internal crisis in the Congress.

The elections in November 1934, and the subsequent events
eluded this confrontation at least for the time being. The
tactics of inflicting defeats one after another on the rulers
in the legislature inspired the people. For the Congress workers
and the people at large who had been facing repressions
continuously for more than a couple of years, the struggle
inside the legislature lent happiness and satisfaction. At the
same time, as we are going to see in the following chapter,
the left forces were also growing.
