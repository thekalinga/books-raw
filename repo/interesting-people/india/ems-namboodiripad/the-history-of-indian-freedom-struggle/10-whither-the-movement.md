# WHITHER THE MOVEMENT ?

## THE DEFEAT OF WHAT?

Not long after Gandhi issued the statement calling off the
_civil disobedience movement_, he was arrested and sentenced
to imprisonment for six years. With that ended the
struggle which he had been leading for about one year. This
naturally caused disappointment and protest in the Congress
ranks and among the people. Even before Gandhi's arrest,
his statement calling off the struggle had generated opposition
form many of the top Congress leaders. Motilal Nehru,
Lajpat Rai, Vithalbhai Patel and other leaders who were in
jail wrote to Gandhi strongly protesting against the calling
off the movement. Motilal Nehru wrote that withdrawing
the movement in the name of violence in _Chauri Chaura_
was like punishing a town on the foothills of the Himalayas
for a breach of _non-violence_ committed by the people in a village near Kanyakumari. He asked Gandhi to isolate
_Chauri Chaura_ and _Gorakhpur_ and "go on with the
disobedience movement, individual as well as mass."

The 'moderates' outside the Congress and other _anti-non-cooperationists_
utilized this opportunity to publicly blame
Gandhi and the Congress. They said that withdrawing students
from their schools, the _boycott_ of courts by lawyers,
and _boycott_ of elections were proved foolish. They accused
Gandhi of hoodwinking people by his promise of "_Swaraj_
in one year". Naturally all this had its impact on the Congress
sympathizers.

But this was of no comfort to the 'moderates'. The
activity they claimed to be more "practical" than Gandhi's
_non-cooperation_ programme was being proved, as days
passed, to be an utter failure. The 'moderate' leaders themselves
had to admit this publicly.

In 1921, when the _non-cooperation_ struggle was launched,
the _constitutional reforms_ were being implemented. The
Congress boycotted the elections to the legislatures held as
part of the reforms. The 'moderates' contested the election,
entered the legislatures and became ministers. They tried
to utilize the benefits of these new opportunities to the extent
possible. As this activity progressed, the true nature of the
reforms became more and more clear.

All important departments continued to be directly
under the control of the Governor. Education, health,
development activities, etc., were transferred to the elected
members of the legislature (ministers). Some ministers
have later recounted their experience as ministers. According
to K.V. Reddy, a former Ministers of Agriculture in _Madras
Presidency_, for example: I was the minister of the Department
of Development. But forest was not under my control.
I was the Minister of Agriculture but the Department of
Irrigation was not under me. Although I was the Minister
of Agriculture, the scheme of _taccavi_[^taccavi] and land improvement
loans to the farmers was not within the purview of my department.
One can imagine how efficiently and effectively a
minister of agriculture who has no control over _taccavi_ loans
and over famine relief, can function. Simultaneously, I was
also the Minister of the Department of Labour. But I had
no control over factories, boilers, electricity, hydropower,
mines and labour relations which were under the direct
control of the Governor.

[^taccavi]: _Taccavi loan_ was a short-term loan given to poor farmers to purchase seeds, fertilizers, equipment and for other agriculture purposes. Taccavi loans are lent by the Government during emergencies or distress like famine, flood, etc.

The condition of the minister of health was more pitiable;
he had no control over the higher officials in the department.
It was the Secretary for State for India in London who took
decisions on their appointment, service conditions and other
matters.

In short, the representatives of the people were entrusted
with the outer shell of the administration. And even in the
administration of the departments assigned to the ministers,
the Governor and the ICS officers wielded wide powers.
Formally, the ministers were responsible to the legislature, and they were answerable to the legislature with regard to
the activities of the departments assigned to them. Ministers
were obliged to resign in case the legislature lacked confidence
in them. But in practice, nothing of the kind happened.

Although the function of each department was subject
to the principle of _collective responsibility_ of the ministry,
the Governor, violating the principle, regarded each minister
as his advisor. Accordingly, the Governor claimed the right
to accept or reject the advice of the ministers. Thus, the
Governor became the _de facto_ ruler taking decisions even
on matters relating to the departments assigned to the
ministers.

Besides, the officers who worked under the ministers
belonged to the ICS who were directly responsible to the
Governor. Even when they defied the ministers, they got the
protection of the Governor. Thus, though the ministers were
answerable to the legislature and the people, it turned out
that they were just a band of persons with no functional
powers.

According to C.Y. Chintamani, the first education
minister of UP, even in such a trivial matter as nominating
members of a library committee, the Governor took
decision autocratically rejecting the decision of the minister.
Similar was the experience of several ministers in other
provinces also.

The minister's decision was rejected by the Governor
in this manner whenever there was a difference of opinion
between the minister and an ICS officer working under
him. That is, any decision taken by a minister against the
wishes of the ICS officer would be rejected by the Governor.
It was based on such experience that ministers like
Surendranath Banerjee and PC Mitter of Bengal, MP
Joshi of Madhya Pradesh and the ministers of Orissa,
Madras, Bihar and other provinces expressed their opinion
that the _constitutional reforms_ of 1919 were a fiasco.

There were also several instances of no-confidence
resolutions moved in the legislatures against individual ministers
or against ministries. On many an occasion, such resolutions
were "defeated" with the combined strength of the
nominated members and a minority of the elected members,
although a majority of the elected members voted in favour
of the resolutions.

The Raja of Panagal, who was the Chief Minister of
Madras, during a discussion on a no-confidence motion tabled
against him in November 1923, categorically said that he
was responsible only to the Governor.

Hilliers, a European member in the Bengal legislature
for two terms, said that he did not expect this _administrative
reforms_ to succeed until the scheme was completely changed
assigning the full responsibility of the departments --- however
small and insignificant they might be --- to the ministers, stopping
the intervention of the Governor and avoiding the votes
of the official members in the legislature.

What has been cited above was the experience of many
of the 'moderate' leaders after they had been legislators or
ministers for some years since 1921. Even before such direct
experience --- from the time the reforms were brought into
force --- the 'moderate' leaders had started realizing the inadequacy
of the system and the unacceptability of the general
policy pursued by the authorities. The resolutions adopted
at the conference of the 'moderates' held towards the end of 1921, couched in a 'moderate' language though, underlined the
same demands put forward by the Congress. The conference
demanded full popular control, within two years, on all
Central Government departments, except those of defence
foreign relations, relation with native states and religious
affairs.

The conference declared that the Indian people would
not be satisfied unless the officials responsible for cruelty,
insult and repression during the martial law regime in Punjab
were suitably punished. It adopted a resolution expressing
regret at the non-implementation of the undertaking given
by the British Prime Minister to the Muslims in January 1918 and appealing to amend the treaty between Britain and
Turkey.

The conference protested against the repression let loose
by the Government and warned the Government that unless
a conciliatory policy was adopted, the reforms would fail.

These resolutions showed that the 'moderates' shared the
same feelings expressed by those who participated in the
_non-cooperation_ movement. The British policy, on the other
hand, was not only not conciliatory towards the people in
general and the Congress in particular, but it was not
agreeable even to the 'moderates'.

The speech made by Lloyd George in the House of
Commons on 2nd August defending the Civil Service in India
was provocative even to the 'moderates'. He said that whether
the elected members in the legislatures succeeded or
failed as members of the legislatures or as ministers, he could
see no period when they could dispense with the guidance
and assistance of a small nucleus of British Civil Servants
and British officials in India. He added that the British
Civil Servants were the "steel frame of the whole structure"
and no matter what one built on or off it, if that steel frame
was taken out, the fabric would collapse. "We will not
interfere with the functioning of a particular establishment;
we will not weaken it; we will not deprive it of its powers
and responsibilities. That establishment is the Civil Service
in India", he said.

It was a heavy blow struck by the rulers against the
expectations of the 'moderates' who thought that by getting
elected to the legislatures and by becoming ministers, they
could, step by step, solve national issues and ultimately realize
the national demand of _Home Rule_. It was a clear
warning that the Indian people's representatives would never
get an opportunity to turn the wheel of the administration
free from the control of British civilian officers.

It was in this background that the ministers had to
function, sandwiched between the Governor and the British
ICS officers and in continuous conflict with them. Protesting
against this, some ministers like C.Y. Chintamani of
UP resigned. At a session of the Central legislative Council
in September 1926, a resolution was passed by a majority
vote (48 against 34) deprecating the speech of the Prime
Minister.

Meanwhile, another important development took place.
On 9th March 1922 the Secretary of State for India, Montagu,
resigned. The circumstances which led to his resignation
deserve special mention.

The Government of India in a telegram sent to the
British government suggested taking a conciliatory attitude
to the Indian Muslims and reviewing the pact with Turkey
in view of their feelings. They also asked for permission
to publish the content of that message, which was granted
by the Secretary of State for India. Prime Minister Lloyd
George reacted to this stating that the Secretary of State had
acted beyond his powers, which led to the latter's resignation.

It became clear that the government in England was one
which was not willing to accept matters of which the British
authorities in India, including the Viceroy, as also the Secretary
of State for India were convinced. The 'moderates' came
to the conclusion that the vested interests and ICS officers
who had opposed the Reforms formulated with the initiative
of Montagu and which had raised great expectations among
the 'moderates', had tightened their grip on the British
government.

In this background, it was obvious that whatever
propaganda the 'moderates' indulged in against _non-cooperation_
could not cut any ice. The 'moderates' might have been
able to point an accusing finger at Gandhi saying that "_Swaraj_
in one year" had not come, that the education and lives of
thousands of youngsters were disrupted and that the programme
of _non-cooperation_ had failed as a whole. But the
question as to where their own policy of cooperation had
taken the country and themselves was staring at them. Honest
'moderates' had to accept the fact that their policy of cooperation
flopped no less miserably than the _non-cooperation_ of
Gandhi and the Congress.

It was in this context that the question came up before
the _Congressmen_ as to what policy and approach they should
adopt in the situation created following the suspension of the
_civil disobedience movement_ by Gandhi.

## THE SPLIT AND THE AGREEMENT

Though _non-cooperation_ was withdrawn, there was no
letup in the repression on the part of the Government. Congress
leaders, including Gandhi, were behind the bars. The
AICC met in Lucknow in June 1922 to discuss the future
course of action in the circumstances and decided to appoint
a committee to tour round the country and report on the
situation prevailing in the country.

The committee thus appointed toured the provinces,
met important Congress workers, held discussions with them
and reached the following conclusions: (1) The conditions
in the country were not favourable to launch a disobedience
movement; (2) the _constructive programme_, considered an
inseparable part of the movement, could not inspire the
people.

The natural conclusion flowing out of this is that the
_boycott_ of elections and work in the legislature should be given
up and that elections and the legislature should be utilized as
the main platform of political struggle against the rulers.
_Boycott_ of the legislature was linked with the inspiring slogan
of "_Swaraj_ in one year". As this slogan had lost its relevance,
it was pointed out, the _boycott_ of legislatures too had become
irrelevant. A powerful group emerged from among the Congress
leadership strongly advocating such a change in the
party's policy. At the same time, a considerable section of
the Congress ranks feared that adopting the programme of
legislature work would be a return to the old 'moderate'
politics. A section of the leadership too shared this view.

The Gaya session of the Congress held in December 1922 became an occasion for a clash between these view-points.
CR Das who had by then come out of jail was the chairman
of the session. He and other prominent leaders like
Motilal Nehru favoured a change in policy. On the opposite
side were leaders like C. Rajagopalachari and Rajendra
Prasad. After a heated debate, "policy changers" were
defeated in the voting. The majority was on the side of a
continuation of _boycott_. Das resigned stating that he could
not continue as president in these circumstances.

Many felt that the Congress was heading towards a
split as at the Surat Congress some 16 years ago. But, since
Gandhi and certain other top leaders were in prison, the
stalemate continued. The "policy changers" went their own
way. Though the debate continued between the two groups,
they worked on parallel lines without interfering with each
other.

CR Das and Motilal Nehru went ahead with the
programme of legislature activities, and formed the _Swaraj
Party_. Their candidates contested the elections in November 1923, defeated many 'moderate' leaders like Surendranath
Banerjee and Chintamani reducing that party to a pitiable
plight. At the Centre and in a number of provinces, the
_Swaraj Party_ bagged a sizeable number of seats.

The principal factor that enabled the _Swaraj Party_ to
carry on its activities in parallel with that of the Congress
was the policy pursued by that party. They claimed that they
adhered to the programme of _non-cooperation_ in all matters
except in the case of _boycott_ and parliamentary work.
Thus, the leaders of the _Swaraj Party_ were able to convince
the _Congressmen_ that their parliamentary activities were
complementary to the _boycott_ programme.

Consequently, a compromise resolution was adopted at
the special session of the Congress held in Delhi in September 1923. The resolution stated:

>While reaffirming its adherence to the principle of _non-violent_
_non-cooperation_, this Congress declares that such
_Congressmen_ as have no religious or other conscientious
objections against entering the legislatures are at liberty
to stand as candidates and to exercise their right of voting
at the forthcoming elections, and this Congress therefore
suspends all propaganda against entering the councils.[^10/1]

[^10/1]: A. M. Zaidi and S. G. Zaidi, _Encyclopaedia of the Indian National Congress_
Vol. 8, New Delhi. Chand and Company, 1980, p. 607.

After having thus secured the formal blessings of the
Congress, the _Swaraj Party_ leaders issued a manifesto making
their position clear as to what they would do if they won
the elections. The essential point of this manifesto was that
the _Swarajists_, if elected to the Central Legislative Assembly,
would assert in the Assembly India's right to frame her
constitution in the Indian legislature. If the Government
refused to concede this demand, they would uncompromisingly
and continuously adopt a policy of obstruction to make the governmental functioning through the legislature
impossible.

People could clearly see the contrast between this policy
of the _Swaraj Party_ and the lukewarm policy of the 'moderates'
which paved the way for the miserable defeat of the
'moderates' and the prestigious victory of the _Swaraj Party_.
In the Central legislature it became such a force that it
could, with the support of independents led by Jinnah, defeat
the Government. In the Central Provinces it commanded
the majority. It emerged as a powerful group in the provinces
of Bengal, Bombay and UP. Thus, the _Swaraj Party_
which contested as an independent force without the full
organized support of the Congress, emerged as a political
force to be reckoned with all over India.

In the absence of Gandhi, a section of the leaders who
claimed themselves and considered by others to be the firm
adherents of the Gandhi's policy left the _Swaraj Party_ and
carried out the Gandhian _constructive activities_ and the
organizational work of the Congress. So long as Gandhi was
in jail, there was no difficulty in following this course. But the
situation was bound to change once Gandhi came out and
took over the leadership. What then? Would the Congress
split again as it did following the Surat Congress of 1906 ?
The people were anxiously observing the developments.

In the meantime, shocking news was published on 13th
January 1924. Gandhi had been removed from the Yerwada
prison to the Sassoon Hospital in Poona for a surgical
operation. Based on this news given out officially, the _Swaraj
Party_ gave notice of a resolution in the Central Legislative
Assembly demanding Gandhi's release. A discussion on the
resolution was fixed for 5th February. But on the 4th February
night, the Government issued a press note stating that Gandhi
was being released from the prison condoning the rest of the
period of his sentence as the doctors attending him recommended
him rest for six months in a seaside resort.

Though he was soon released from jail, it took many
weeks for Gandhi to be able to participate in political discussions.
And when the _AICC_ session was held at Ahmedabad
in June 1924, Gandhi and Motilal came to a clash with each
other. Gandhi moved a resolution rendering those failing
to fulfil the obligation of hand spinning "regarded as a
necessary preliminary to _civil disobedience_" ineligible to
election to Congress committees. Motilal Nehru forcefully
opposed the resolution stating that "the _Charkha_ programme
will not take us an inch closer to _Swaraj_". He requested
Gandhi to ask his followers how far they had implemented
the _constructive programme_ while he was in jail.

However, the resolution was adopted with 82 votes
against 68. Protesting against this, Motilal and Das walked
out of the session along with their followers. But soon
they and Gandhi came to an agreement. According to
this agreement, all sections in the congress were obliged to
implement the programmes of _Khadi_, handspinning, removal
of untouchability and Hindu-Muslim unity; it was the responsibility
of the _Swaraj Party_ to carry out the work in the
central and provincial legislatures on behalf and as part of
the congress; the _Swaraj Party_ had to frame the necessary
rules, collect and manage funds for carrying out the legislature
activities.

Thus, the understanding which was earlier arrived at
informally to carry out the activities in a parallel way with the
parliamentary work for the _Swaraj Party_ and other activities
for Congress organization became a formal decision of the
Congress.

In the following few months, the _Swaraj Party_ and its
president, CR Das, tried to bring about an understanding
with the British government. The response of the British
government was favourable.

The Under-Secretary, on behalf of the Secretary of State
for India, made a statement in Parliament that if CR Das
put forward constructive proposals on a new constitution for
India acceptable to the Government of India, the British
government would seriously consider them. Thereupon, Das
in a statement put forward certain proposals which included
the immediate release of all political prisoners, non-interference
in the functioning of Central and provincial legislatures,
and unequivocal acceptance by the British government
of the right of Indians to establish _Swaraj_ within the British
Commonwealth, etc. A general impression gained ground
that behind this open exchange of opinion between Das and
the British government, certain private discussions too were
being held.

To strength this impression, the Viceroy Lord Reading
went to London and held discussions with the Secretary of
State for India, Lord Birkenhead. Following this, it was
declared that the Secretary of State for India would shortly
make a statement. Meanwhile, Das suddenly passed away,
bringing the curtain down on the negotiations. The expected
statement from the Secretary of State did not come, either.

With this, significant change came about in the policy
and approach of Gandhi and the Congress leadership. Within
a month of the death of Das, Gandhi felt the need to
review the relationship between the _Swaraj Party_ and the
Congress. In a letter to Motilal Nehru Gandhi wrote:

>I have come to the conclusion that the Congress need not
continue mainly to be a _spinners' association_. I consider it
necessary to enhance the position and influence of the _Swaraj
Party_ in the new political situation created as a result of Lord
Birkenhead's speech in the Parliament. This will be possible
only if the Congress is transformed into an organization engaged
mainly in political work. In accordance with the earlier
understanding, the activities of the Congress were confined
to _constructive programmes_. I understand that in the changed
situation the country has to face, this restriction need not be
continued. ... I am of the opinion that the next AJCC
must take decisions in such a way that the entire organization
would be used for your activities.

Accordingly, at the _AICC_ meeting at Patna in September 1925 the Congress decided to re-start political activities,
instead of confining itself to _constructive activities_
assigning the political work to the _Swaraj Party_ and to form
a separate body to organize _constructive activities_ including
spinning and weaving _Khadi_. According to this decision,
the Congress would thereafter set up candidates for elections
and conduct political agitations inside and outside the legislatures.
A new organization, the _All-India Spinners Association_,
was brought into being to look after _constructive activities_.

Thus ended the fear that a new split might take place in
the Congress once again. Both sides came forward to build a
popular movement by co-ordinating and interlinking the
legislature activities, the _constructive programmes_ and the
organizational activities of the Congress. The political developments
that motivated them to take this stand were evident
from the development we have shown above. They may be
summarized as follows.

1. In the circumstances arising out of the calling off of
   the _civil disobedience_ and _non-cooperation_, it became necessary
   for the _bourgeois_ leadership as a whole, including
   Gandhi, Motilal and Das, to evolve a new strategy and
   tactics of struggle.
2. It also became necessary for the _bourgeois_ leadership
   to simultaneously negotiate with the British authorities,
   if possible, and to keep the people ready for starting
   _non-cooperation_ and _civil disobedience_ in a favourable
   atmosphere, in case the attempts to negotiate with the British
   failed. Both these had to be done simultaneously and
   harmoniously. It was on the question of how this could be
   done that the Gandhian group and the 'pro-changers' led by
   Das and Motilal differed.
3. The agreement arrived at among Gandhi, CR Das
   and Motilal Nehru helped consciously or otherwise to effect
   a division of work acceptable to both sides. The Das-Nehru
   group to keep in contact, though informally, with the
   British authorities up to the highest level while Gandhi and
   his colleagues to prepare for a struggle --- this the meaning
   of the understanding between the _Swaraj Party_ which functioned
   independently of the Congress and the Congress
   which was confined itself mainly to _constructive activities_.
4. When this tactic failed --- when it became clear that
   the negotiations initiated by Das had failed --- it became
   necessary to bring under the direct control of the Congress
   all political activities including that of the legislatures. Consequently,
   the _Spinners' Association_ now replaced the _Swaraj
   Party_.

Briefly, the parliamentary activity under the leadership
of Das, Nehru and others and the _constructive activities_
under Gandhi were useful as two faces of a unified political
movement advancing under the leadership of the _bourgeoisie_.
That was why instead of a break between the two sections,
an understanding between them was finally arrived at.

## THE WORKING CLASS MOVEMENT

In the last few sections, we have examined the attempts
made by Indian _bourgeoisie_ to rally the entire Indian people
under its banner making use of the post-war mass upsurge.
In the process, we saw the tremendous success Gandhi made
in this regard, although in many places the people had gone
beyond the bound set by him.

Another feature of the post-war mass upsurge needs
special mention here. For the first time in the history of
the _freedom struggle_, the working class began to take part
in the political struggles as a class with its own forms of
struggle. Unlike in the earlier days when the workers went
on strikes off and on, now they were transforming themselves
into a class giving shape to a stable organization (trade union).
to protect their class interest.

When the 'extremist' politics began to emerge under
Tilak, Lajpat Rai and others, the poor, including workers
and peasants, began to imbibe political consciousness and to
participate in the _freedom struggle_. The 'extremists' formulated
their programme of propaganda and agitation keeping
the poor sections of the people in mind. (This was the basic
difference between the earlier 'moderate' and the new 'extremist'
leaderships.) The urban and rural poor used to attend
in large numbers in meetings addressed by the 'extremist'
leaders. When these leaders were arrested and prosecuted,
they used to crowd in the court to pay them their respect and
to follow the trend of the case. We have already referred
to the strike of workers of the textile mills in Bombay in
protest against the arrest of Tilak.

The workers who had begun to participate in the _freedom
struggle_ made a significant gain of their own. They could
take the first steps in the direction of organizing themselves
as a class though such actions. We have referred earlier to
the workers' strike in the different parts of the Country,
which received the blessings and guidance of national leaders
like Tilak, Lajpat Rai and Gandhi. We have also referred
to the strike of the workers of textile mills in Ahmedabad
and also to the strikes that took place in many other parts
of the country as port of the _non-cooperation_ movement.
Thus, the growth of the freedom movement gave rise to an
atmosphere in the industrial centres enabling the workers to
go into actions to get their grievances redressed and win their
demands.

But, at all these stages, the working class was just an
appendage to the _bourgeois_-led national movement, participating,
like all other classes, in the national struggle under
the leadership of the _bourgeoisie_. The _bourgeois_ national
leadership rendered assistance to the working class as it did
lo all other sections of the people. The workers had not yet
acquired either the ability or the strength, as an independent
class, to act beyond the limit set by the _bourgeois_ leadership.
An important feature of the post-war mass upsurge was that
it marked the beginning of the emergence of the working
class as an independent force.

The years 1920--1921, when the _non-cooperation_ movement
surged ahead, were crucial for the working class.
These years witnessed working class strikes on an unprecedented
scale all over the country. Though connected with the
_non-cooperation_ movement and raising its political slogans,
the working class raised the slogans of their own economic
demands in these strikes. Besides, sympathetic strikes also
had begun to take place, in support of a strike in an industry
or a town. Above all, in the then existing conditions of a
steep increase in the profits of the capitalists, the majority of
the strikes ended in complete or partial victory. These were
the circumstances which helped the workers to come on the
scene as an organized social force with confidence in their
own organization.

In 1920, Bombay witnessed the largest number of strikes
with the maximum number of workers participating in them.
Over 200,000 workers participated in the textile strike from 2nd February to 6th March demanding increased wages and
reduced working hours. Neglecting the heavy losses due to
the strike, the workers defeated the efforts of the management
to break the strike forcibly with the help of the police
and the military. But none of these affected the unity or the
militancy of the workers. Ultimately, the mill owners were
compelled to come to terms with the striking workers by
increasing the bonus rate (from 20 percent to 40 percent),
granting compensation for accidents to workers and reducing
the working hours.

In the Tata Iron and Steel mills at Jamshedpur, too, a
prolonged strike took place in 1920. Since the cost of living
there was the highest in India, the workers demanded a 50
percent increase in wages. They also demanded compensation
for accidents and cash payment to near relatives in
cases of death. Nearly 30,000 workers took part in the
strike. The management tried to break the strike by prolonging
it. But, finally, they were forced to come to a settlement
partially conceding the demands.

The Jalalpur railway workers' strike of 1920 too deserves
special mention. The workers who picketed the blacklegs
were fired upon, leaving 15 killed and 23 injured. But the
will of the workers remained unshaken. Here too, the
management was forced to come to a settlement with the
workers.

The strike by 30,000 mill workers of Ahmedabad, the
strike by white collar workers in Bombay and by the gas
workers of Bombay and Calcutta were also significant. The
British newspapers said that although the workers went on
strikes raising their demands, these strikes were part of the
_non-cooperation_ movement sponsored by the Congress, hence
political.

As these strike struggles went ahead, their trade unions
began to emerge. According to the estimate of the Labour
Department of the Government of Bombay published in
september 1920, there were 93 unions in the presidency with
a total membership of 120,000. In most of the unions, those
elected to the leadership were educated middle-class people
connected with the national movement or skilled British
workers employed in India.

It was also in the 1920 that the _All-India Trade Union
Congress (AITUC)_ was formed uniting the trade union organizations
in the different provinces. The activists of the _Indian National
Congress_ and the _British Labour Party_ played an active
role in its formation. The 'extremist' leader, Lala Lajpat Rai
was elected its president. Its conference, in which delegates
from trade unions all over the country participated, declared
that the task of the Indian working class was to organize
struggles for the betterment of their economic life.

In 1921, the strike struggles surged further forward.
Workers in the tea plantations of Assam also came to the
scene of struggle. Protesting against low wages and abject
poverty, about 12,000 workers left the plantations in search
of work elsewhere. The Gurkha Army was sent to bring
them back. The beastly cruelty inflicted upon the workers
by the Gurkha forces aroused the wrath of the entire country.
The railway, wharf and steamer workers of Bengal struck
work in sympathy with the Assam plantation labourers.
Consequently, the economic life of the entire province remained
paralysed for about two months.

In 1921, the total number of strikes in India was 396 in
which a total number of 600,000 workers participated. Nearly
half of these strikes ended in complete or partial success.
Thus,during the period two years in which the _non-cooperation_
movement was launched and withdrawn, the working class
appeared as one of the main social forces in the _freedom
struggle_. In ensuring the success of the protest actions,
including the one against the visit of the Prince of Wales,
the working class played a vital role.

At the same time, it became clear that the working
class was not willing to remain within the bounds set by the
_non-cooperation_ programme evolved by the Congress under
Gandhi. As we have seen earlier, Gandhi had suspended
the Bardoli civil dis-obedience having become upset by the
"violence" on the part of workers and the common people
in Bombay in the protest actions against the Prince's visit
even before calling off the entire movement following the
_Chauri Chaura_ incident.

Peasants constitute a section of people who ought to
have got themselves organized as the working class movements
make advance. The _non-cooperation_ movement helped to
develop in them a new political awareness and militancy. In
many areas like Punjab, Malabar, and Avadh and Agra
in UP, the advance of the _non-cooperation_ and _Khilafat_
movements brought the peasants into the arena of struggle.
But unlike the working class, the peasants were incapable of
forming their own organizations or of rallying under their
own banner to fight in defence of their own demands. The
movement that developed among the peasants was a blend of
deep hatred against foreign domination and a protest against
rent, taxes, etc., combined with the religious and casteist
thinking.

It was one of such movements that developed into the
_Malabar (Moplah) Rebellion_. It, in fact, started as a mass
movement which arose out of a strong desire for independence
combined with the _Jenmi_ (landlord)-tenant problem which
agitated the entire population, irrespective of caste or religious
differences. But, since there was the element of the _Khilafat_
issue that became an integral part of the political movement
and also since the tenancy problem agitated the Muslim tenants
more than anyone else, the Muslim masses participated
in the movement relatively more actively than others. And
they were also subject to the ideological influence of their
religious leaders.

In the circumstances, as the movement began to make
advance, it began to acquire a Muslim communal colour.
Among the Muslim masses participating in the movement,
the thought of fighting for religion and God gained supremacy
over the thought of solutions to the political and economic
problems. Their religious feelings reached a state of fermentation
when the Muslim masses who were continuously being
subjected to the propaganda of their religious heads whom
they considered their leaders, saw that the majority of those
who were oppressing them in collusion with the British were
the Hindus. They became enslaved by this thought. The
struggle which they started against the British authorities and
the _Jenmis_ gradually turned anti-Hindu. The organized propaganda
campaign carried out by the Hindu bigwigs and the
British authorities aided them to strengthen their anti-Hindu
feelings. Thus, the popular rebellion turned into the
'_Moplah rebellion_'.

The _Akali_ movement which brought the Sikh peasantry
of Punjab into the arena of struggle, too, had a religious
image, though it did not deteriorate to the level of communal
clashes as in Malabar. The Sikh _Gurudwaras_ and their enormous
properties were under the control of the Mahants who
were leading a luxurious life misusing the common property
of the Sikh community. They were also utilizing these properties
against all progressive movements of the community.
The _Akali_ movement was started as a social reformation
movement against the misrule of the Mahants. Thousands
of Sikh peasants came forward to take part in this movement
and face repression, in which they had the full support of the
national movement. Leaders of the _Ghadar Party_ which had
an important place among the Indian revolutionary movements
abroad, the _Indian National Congress_ led by Gandhi, the
Punjabi intellectuals --- all fought together against the Mahant
domination, which in effect turned against the British rulers
who were giving protection to the Mahants.

The peasant struggle in UP, on the other hand, had
grown completely on political and economic basis. The
movement, known as the _Eka Movement_, which emerged in
a number of districts against the exploitation of the _zamindars_
and the government may be said to be the first organized
peasant movement in India. As in many other places, here too
the authorities came out to dub the peasant movement as an
organization of the "thugs" and to unleash repression against
them."Revolution spreads to North India", "Revolt spreads to
the East" were some of the headlines under which the British
newspapers published the news about this peasant movement.

Though not on such a wide scale, peasant discontent found
expression in certain regions of Bengal, in some _Princely
States_ like Travancore and other regions in the country. But
none of them was as organized as that of the workers. Nowhere
did a permanent organization (like trade unions) emerge.
Hence, when the _anti-imperialist_ advance of 1920--21 was
halted, the peasant revolts too died down.

Besides, in certain places as in Malabar, movements
which had begun as peasant revolts ended up in communal
revolts. In other words, conditions were not yet mature for
the formation of an organized peasant movement which would
be a comrade-in-arms to the organized working class movement,
a movement which would organize and rally the
peasants as a whole, irrespective of religious-caste considerations,
in the struggle against their class enemies.

However, political conditions for the simultaneous
advance of the organized workers' and peasants' movements
and both strengthening the national movement on an unprecedented
scale had begun to emerge. Tens of thousands of
young men and women who had come forward inspired by
the slogan of "_Swaraj_ in one year" and now shocked at the
withdrawal of the disobedience movement, were engaged in
a process of serious political rethinking. These young men
and women, convinced of the need to find a new path in place
of the tried and rejected paths of _moderatism_, extremism,
individual revolutionary acts and Gandhian _non-cooperation_
had begun to take steps which were destined to
change the entire course of events in the country, the background
and growth of which we will examine in the following
pages.

## THE NEW VOICE

The political atmosphere became dark after the withdrawal
of the _civil disobedience movement_. The _anti-imperialist_
national unity that existed during the _non-cooperation_-_Khilafat_
movement shattered. The fond hope that the Indian
people entering the country-wide _civil disobedience movement_
after passing through the multi-faceted _non-cooperation_ and
_boycott_ needed only one year to uproot the imperialist
domination and win independence proved misplaced. The
leaders who were in the forefront of the _non-cooperation_ _Khilafat_
movement turned into the spokesmen of entry into
legislatures on the one side and Government propagandists
on the other. The youth who were disappointed at this sight
returned to the old 'bomb-politics'. A section of the leaders
who had rallied under the banner of the _Khilafat_ movement
went ahead with the formation of Muslim communal organizations
and another with the formation of Hindu communal
organizations to preserve the 'special interests' of these respective
communities. Meanwhile, the Sikhs, Christians, the
_non-Brahmins_ and depressed castes formed their own organizations
and fought to preserve their 'special interests'.

In this complex and confusing political atmosphere a
new voice, quite distinct from and even opposed to the above
trends, began to be heard. This was a call to transform the
Congress into a mass revolutionary movement based on the
increasing strength and unity of the organized working class,
the peasants and other labouring people who were just
entering into struggles.

This call given jointly by two Communists, MN Roy
and Abani Mukherji, was addressed to and distributed among
the delegates to the Ahmedabad session of the _Indian
National Congress_ held in December 1921. This document
published in the name of two known Communists and proposing
that the Congress should advance relying on the growing
organized movements of workers, peasants and other masses,
marked an important milestone in the growth of the _Indian
Communist_ movement.

However, this was not a call formally representing the
Communist movement. The main reason for publishing the
document in the name of these two individuals was that the
Communist movement and its organization were not known
among _Congressmen_, whereas Roy and Mukherjee were
known to them.

Roy and Mukherjee had participated earlier in the Indian
revolutionary movement. Roy had been involved and
sentenced in a number of cases. But, later on, he went
abroad and established relation and worked with the Indian
revolutionary organizations there. Mukherjee too went abroad
to work with overseas Indian revolutionaries. Therefore,
both of them had personal relations with many who had
played leading roles in the _non-cooperation_-_Khilafat_ movements.

Roy and Mukherjee knew that many among the Congress
leaders and ordinary workers in India were dissatisfied with
both the _non-cooperation_-_Khilafat_ programme and its failure.
They considered it timely to attempt to instill among _Congressmen_,
caught in the whirlpool of _bourgeois_-_petty-bourgeois_
thinking, the consciousness of organized mass
revolution. This was what they attempted to do in the call
given to the Ahmedabad Congress.

However, even before this, conditions in India had
become mature for starting a Communist movement
and an organization in the name of a "_Communist Party
of India_". A brief history of this background is as follows.

1. The ideas of Karl Marx had begun to spread in a
   limited way among a narrow circle of intellectuals in India
   even before the First World War. Lala Hardayal, one of
   those Indian revolutionaries who went abroad, wrote a
   biography of Marx, which was published in the March 1912
   issue of the _Modern Review_. A few months later, _Swadeshabhimani_
   Ramakrishna Pillai published a biography of Marx
   in Malayalam, incorporating most of the facts included in
   the biography written by Hardayal. Both were attempts to
   present "Marx the great" before the general public. (In his
   article, Hardayal had made it clear that he did not subscribe
   to the theories of Marx.) However, Hardayal and Ramakrishna
   Pillai were two pointers to future developments.
2. After the _Russian revolution_ of 1917 the ideas of
   Marx began to spread among the freedom fighters in India.
   Even before this revolution, the activities of the Russian
   revolutionaries as that of the revolutionaries elsewhere had
   attracted the attention of Indian revolutionaries. For example,
   the _Russian revolution_ of 1905 had inspired the 'extremists'
   like Tilak. But all these had only helped the growth of
   bomb-politics' among Indian revolutionaries. It was only
   with the 1917 revolution that its class basis and ideology
   began to exert influence, at least to a limited extent, on Indian
   revolutionaries.
3. The Indians most influenced by the _Russian revolution_
   were the revolutionaries working in Germany, USA,
   Turkey, Afghanistan and other countries immediately before
   and during the First World War. They included Virendranath
   Chattopadhyaya (brother of Harindranath Chattopadhyaya
   and Sarojini Naidu), Barkhatulla, MPBT Acharya and
   others besides MN Roy and Abani Mukherji.
4. Another group also came into being in the same
   period. It consisted of the Muslims who has expressed their
   _anti-imperialist_ feelings during the war and those who had
   participated later in the _Khilafat_ movement. They had
   come to know of the _Russian revolution_ through Afghan and
   other sources at the time of the _non-cooperation_ and _Khilafat_
   movements. Out of the curiosity to know more about the
   revolution and to escape the repression unleashed by the
   British government in India, they went to Russia via Afghanistan.
   (Their journey to Russia was like the Muslim
   pilgrimage to Mecca.) This developed into a great movement.
   In Russia, they learned the theory and practice of
   the revolution. On their way back to India, they were
   arrested by the British authorities at the Afghan-Indian
   border and made accused in the notorious _Peshawar Conspiracy
   Case_. They included Shaukat Usmani who participated
   in the activities of the _Communist Party of India_ in its early
   years and became the target of repressive actions on that
   count, and Ferozuddin Mansur who worked in the _Communist
   Party of India_ and later in the _Communist Party of
   Pakistan_ after the partition.
5. These two sections and other Indian revolutionary
   organizations like the Ghaddar Party made attempts to
   establish relation with the _Communist International_. The
   International, on its part, had tried to impart the knowledge
   of Marxism-Leninism to these Indian revolutionaries and
   to organize them into a revolutionary party. As part of
   this effort, Indian revolutionaries began to take part in the
   conferences and the deliberations of the committees of the
   International. One of them (MN Roy) represented India
   in the leadership of the International.
6. As part of this activity, an organization named the
   _Communist Party of India_ was formed at Tashkent, the
   capital of Soviet Uzbekistan, on 17th October 1920. Its
   members were MN Roy, Evelyn Roy (Roy's wife), Abani
   Mukherjee, Rosa Fitingova, Muhammad Ali, Mohammad
   Shafiq Siddiqi, and MPBT Acharya. Siddigi was elected
   Secretary. The Turkestan Bureau of the _Communist International_
   accorded recognition to this party on 20th December.
7. The formation of the _Communist Party of India_,
   though not on the Indian soil, was an important event in the
   history of the _Indian Communist_ movement. (It was as part
   of its activity that Roy and Mukherjee issued a call
   addressed to the delegates to the Ahmedabad session
   of the Congress.)
8. Meanwhile, the influence of Marxism had begun to
   spread among the young political workers in India. Of these,
   the names of Muzaffar Ahmad in Bengal, SA Dange in
   Bombay and Shingaravelu Chettiar in Madras stand out. They
   played a leading role in the publication of journals and leaflets
   in Bengali, Marathi, Hindi, Urdu and other languages.

There were political workers all over the country who
were opposed to the religious and outmoded thinking behind
Gandhi's _non-cooperation_-_Khilafat_ movement and to the
withdrawal of the powerful mass involvement led by him whenever
it overstepped the limits set by him. They had tested
every means adopted, from that of the old 'moderates' to the
latest programme, and were disillusioned with them; they
needed a new light. It was to meet this need that the call
addressed to Ahmedabad Congress was given by Roy and
Mukherjee.

The call entitled "_Manifesto to the 36th Indian National
Congress, Ahmedabad, 1921_" begins as follows:

>We have met in a very critical moment of the history
of our country to decide various questions affecting gravely
the future of the national life and progress. The Indian
nation today stands on the eve of a great revolution, not
only political, but economic and social as well. The vast
mass of humanity, which inhabits the great peninsula, has
begun to move towards a certain goal; it is awakening after
centuries of social stagnation resulting from economic
and political oppression. The National Congress has
placed itself at the head of this movement. Yours is a
difficult task, and the way before you is beset with obstacles
almost insuperable and pitfalls treacherous and
troublesome. The mission of leading the people of India
onward to the goal of national liberation is great, and you
have made this great mission your own. The National
Congress is no longer a holiday gathering engaged in
idle debates and futile resolution-making, it has become a
political body --- the leader of the movement for national
liberation.[^10/2]

[^10/2]: G. Adhikari, _Documents of the History of the Communist Party of India_,
New Delhi, People's Publishing House, 1971, p. 341.

After exposing the bankruptcy of the political lines
adopted by the Congress led by the 'moderates', which had
to shoulder a great responsibility, the Manifesto also critically
examined the surge made by the Gandhian leadership
with the slogan of "_Swaraj_ in one year". Characterizing
this slogan as "a great declaration", the Manifesto continued:

>... the function of the Congress, as leader of the
>nation, is not only to point out the goal but to lead the
>people step by step towards the goal... The people must be
>infused with enthusiasm to fight for _swaraj_, they must be
>united in this struggle, because without union the goal
>will not be attained.
>
>The greatest problem before the 36th Congress is how to
>enlist the full-hearted support of the people in the national
>cause, how to make the _ignorant masses_ follow the
>banner of _swaraj_. In order to solve this problem, the first
>thing necessary is to know what is it that ails the masses.
>What do they want? What is needed for improving the
>immediate environment of their material existence? Because
>_only by including the redress of their immediate grievances in
>its programme will the Congress be able to assume the practical
>leadership of the masses of the people_[^10/3]

[^10/3]: Adhikari, _Ibid_, pp. 342--343.

After subjecting to serious criticism the _non-cooperation_
programme under Gandhi's leadership and the _Khilafat_ issue
which was raised as part of it, the manifesto concluded:

>Words cannot make people fight, they have to be impelled
by irresistible objective forces. The oppressed, pauperised,
miserable workers and peasants are bound to fight because
there is no hope left for them. _The Congress must have the
workers and peasants behind it, and it can win their lasting
confidence only when it ceases to sacrifice them ostensibly for a
higher cause, namely the so-called "national interest" but really for
the material prosperity of the merchants and manufacturers. If
the Congress would lead the revolution which is shaking India
to the very foundation, let it not put its faith in mere demonstrations
and temporary wild enthusiasm. Let it make the immediate
demands of the trade unions, as summarised by the Cawnpore
workers, its own demands, let it make the programme of the
kisan sabhas its own programme, and the time will soon come
when the Congress will not stop before any obstacle_, it will not
have to lament that swaraj cannot be declared on affixed
date because the people have not made enough sacrifice.
It will be backed by irresistible strength of the entire people
consciously fighting for their material interest. Failing to do
so, _with all its zeal for non-cooperation, for all its determination
to have the Sevres treaty revised, despite its doctrine of "soul
force", the Congress will have to give in to another organization
which will grow out of the ranks of the common people with the
object of fighting for their interests._ If the Congress wants to
have the nation behind it, let it not be blinded by the interest
of a small class, let it not be guided by the unseen hand
of the "merchants and manufacturers" who have replaced
the "talented lawyers" in the Congress and whom the
present tactics seek to install in the place of the "satanic"
British.[^10/4]

[^10/4]: Adhikari, _Ibid_, pp. 352--353.

Thus, for the first time in the history of the Congress, a
new voice was heard in Ahmedabad. This was, as pointed
out in the previous section, under the political conditions
in which an organized working class movement and a militant
peasant movement, though not so well organized, were rising.

## TOWARDS A WORKERS' AND PEASANTS' PARTY

The formation of the _Communist Party of India_ in
Tashkent led to the beginning of a process of separating the
wheat from the chaff in the _freedom struggle_. Because it was
not formed on the "Indian soil", the _Communist Party of
India_ had to face the opposition from a considerable section
of Socialists and Communist sympathizers in India. But the
contribution of this organization to the growth of the Communist
movement in India was more valuable than that made
by many who were working from the "Indian soil" itself.

MN Roy was pre-eminent in the Tashkent organization.
Later, he went out of the Communist movement. By the
time it was ripe for the emergence of an organized _Communist
Party_ in India, Roy had, in effect, become an _antiCommunist_.
But, it would not be prudent to disregard the
role he had played in the growth of the _Communist Party of
India_ on that score. Even to realize the seriousness of the class
betrayal that he committed later on, it is necessary to examine
objectively his early contributions in India.

The central task of a real _Communist party_ in India
was to link the people's aspirations for freedom to the world
revolutionary working class movement. Roy was a person
capable of contributing to the fulfilment of this task.

As pointed out earlier, Roy started his political activity
as a member of a group of "bomb-politics" in Bengal. An
accused in a dacoity case, Roy left India after his release from
the prison and took active part in the revolutionary activities
in a number of countries. Finally, he declared himself and
accepted by others to be a Communist and reached Moscow
where he began his activities connected with the _Communist
International_.

Thus, Roy became a link between the _petty-bourgeois revolutionaries_
of India and the moscow-based world Communist
movement.

Roy did have certain weaknesses characteristic of _petty-bourgeois
revolutionaries_. Most important among these were
self-conceit and bureaucratic behaviour, which constituted
a hindrance in unifying the different groups which had begun
to emerge in different parts of India into an organized
party. He had shown, from the beginning, the tendency to
ruin those who did not abide by his orders.

But this weakness was not confined to Roy alone. Most
of those who claimed that they were fighting the self-deceit
and bureaucracy of Roy themselves were victims of these
same weaknesses. But Roy possessed a quality which none
of them had. By using the _Marxist-Leninist_ outlook which
was the common property of the world Communist movement,
he could analyze and assess the Indian situation in
general and the day-to-day changes that came about in it
in particular. He possessed the experience of the early Indian
revolutionary movement, the ability, based on this experience,
to arrive at a clear understanding of the contemporary
political developments in India and of the personalities
involved in these developments and the revolutionary experience
gained in other places, particularly in Moscow. Above
all he had contact with the top leadership of the world Communist
movement. All these distinguished him from other
revolutionaries.

The works written by SA Dange in the years 1921 and 1922 were important considering the period in which they
appeared. His _Gandhi vs Lenin_ (with all the weakness which
he himself admits) and the journal _Socialist_ published under
his editorship were pathfinders for the _Indian Communist_
movement in the early years. Similarly, M. Shingaravelu
(Madras), Muzaffar Ahmad (Calcutta), Ghulam Hussain
(Lahore) were prominent among those who had helped to
disseminate the Socialist and Communist ideologies in India.
However, anybody who compares the early Marxist works
born on "Indian soil" with those of the same period written
by Roy himself or under his guidance would undoubtedly
admit the superiority of the latter. Unfortunately, we have
little access to works written on "Indian soil" with the
exception of those of Dange. (The volumes compiled by
Dr. Adhikari do not contain any of the works by Shingaravelu
or Ahmad; only a few of Dange's works are found in
them.)

However, the fact remains that no work published in
India in the early 1920s stand in comparison with Roy's _India
in Transition_, published in 1922. One need not hesitate to
say that this work (with all its shortcomings and mistakes)
was the forerunner of Rajani Palme Dutt's _India Today_,
published a few years later.

The relation between British imperialism and the Indian
_bourgeoisie_ and the theory that following the development
of the Indian _bourgeoisie_, British imperialism had been
forced to beat a retreat (Decolonization Theory) constituted
the main conclusion of Roy's book. This was diametrically
opposed to the Leninist tactics of keeping the _bourgeoisie_ to
a limited extent in the _anti-imperialist_ struggle. It was on
this issue that Lenin's views clashed with that of Roy at the
Congress of the _Communist International_. It was on the
same issue that Roy was later expelled from the
_Communist International_ and turned him into an arch
enemy of the _Communist party of India_.

Even to reach such a wrong conclusion, Roy had made
a detailed study of the Indian situation. And he set a new
tradition of using the methodology of Marxism-Leninism
to analyze and assess the Indian situation.

Roy's contribution, however, did not end here. He
together with his colleagues analyzed the day-to-day
changes in Indian politics in the light of the general
perspective of the _Communist International_ and on that
basis coined slogans for day-to-day political actions.

The editorials, notes, reports, etc., appearing in the
_Inprecor_, the organ of the _Communist International_, and
in _the Vanguard_ published under Roy's editorship, were
designed to help the day-to-day political agitations. Besides,
like the call given to the delegates to the Ahmedabad
Congress, many other documents were prepared under
Roy's guidance. These documents were consciously
prepared to follow and assess closely the developments that
were taking place in the _Indian National Congress_ and
other organizations and to exert the influence of the
revolutionary working class on them.

For instance, in the days following the withdrawal of
the _non-cooperation_ movement after the _Chauri Chaura_
incident, Evelyn Roy (pseudonym, Santi Devi) published an
article in the _Vanguard_ analyzing Gandhi and the Gandhian
politics, which stated:

>Here is in this half-naked, slender, brown body so completely
dominated by the mind within, a strength that
dreadnoughts cannot conquer nor machine guns subdue
though they shatter it to bits, and out of the respect bred
of this certain knowledge, the British empire leaves him
unharmed. Six years' simple imprisonment, "with everything
possible to make him comfortable, is the utmost
they dare attempt, and this merely to remove him from
the arena of active politics. When the storm dies down a
little, they will let him free. For they will soon learn, if
they do not already know, that Gandhi the saint in prison
becomes to india's adoring millions Gandhi the
martyr. ... It is well and truly said that, "_Mahatma_ in
jail is more powerful than _Mahatma_ free". ... [^10--1/4]

[^10--1/4]: _The Vanguard_, No. 1, 15 May 1922. Reproduced in G. Adhikari, _Ibid_,
p. 438.

After eulogizing Gandhi's greatness as an individual,
Santi Devi examined in the article the different aspects of
Gandhi --- "Gandhi the philosopher", "Gandhi the politician"
and "Gandhi the patriot". Exposing mercilessly the contradictions
in Gandhi's philosophical outlook and policies, she
underlined the constructive role played by him in adopting
the means of mass struggle to win political demands and
also in building up the Congress party. She concluded her
article, thus:

>In closing what has been a dispassionate analysis of
>Mr Gandhi's influence upon the Indian movement, a heartfelt
>tribute must be paid to Gandhi the politician. We believe
>that Mr Gandhi's political career is inspired by a deep love
>for his suffering countrymen, a love nonetheless noble for
>having made great tactical mistakes. His very utterance
>breaths a deep desire to free the motherland from thralldom,
>and to help her children find a happier life. Few scenes are
>destined to greater immortality in history than the courtroom
>is which Mr Gandhi read out his scathing indictment
>of India, and pleading guilty to the charge of promoting
>disaffection to the government, and asked the judge to
>give him the maximum sentence.
>
>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi will live in the annals
>of his country as one of its saints and patriots, long after
>his political failures are forgotten.[^10/5]

[^10/5]: _The Vanguard_, No. 3, 15 June 1922, _Ibid_, pp. 458--459.

While exposing the Gandhian philosophy and politics
by examining the political background that gave rise to
Gandhism from the stand-point of the working class, the
article objectively evaluated the role played by Gandhi and
Gandhism in the awakening of the Indian people. Viewed
from the background of this article, the shortcomings of
Dange's work mentioned above become obvious.

This, however, was not confined to assessing a single
phenomenon of _Mahatma Gandhi_. After the Congress
adopted Gandhi's _non-cooperation_ programme, Roy and his
colleagues were keen on bringing about changes in the day-to-day
conditions in favour of the revolutionary forces.
When difference of opinion arose between Gandhi and CR
Das, Roy wrote an article assessing it, and offering support
to Das subject to certain conditions. Later, when Jawaharlal
Nehru showed leftist leanings, he offered critical welcome
to it. Intervening directly in various developments in this
manner, Roy tried to form a revolutionary group inside the
Congress.

While imbibing the spirit of readiness of the Congress
to launch the _non-cooperation_ struggle, he appealed to the
leftist nationalists to adopt the outlook of Marxism-Leninism
instead of the Gandhian philosophical outlook. He placed
before them the form of struggle based on the organized
strength of workers and peasants in place of the _moderatist_
agitation, _non-violent_ mass struggle and 'bomb-politics.'

Though Roy's name is mentioned here with added
importance, it must be emphasized that it was the world
Communist leadership which handled Indian politics through
Roy. The documents compiled by Dr. Adhikari contains appeals
addressed to Indian revolutionaries by the _Communist
International_ and the revolutionary trade union organization,
the _Red Trade Union International (RILU)_. It was the
_Communist International_ which carried out the task of removing
confusion and bringing clarity of ideas and of
building up an organized revolutionary movement out of a
splintered mass movement. Roy was functioning only as a
representative of that body.

As a result of all these activities, a left democratic party
was gradually coming into being. Attempts were made to
form the _Hindustan Labour Kisan Party_ under the leadership
of Shingaravelu Chettiar in Madras, and to form the
_Indian Socialist Labour Party_ of the _Indian National Congress_
in Bombay under the leadership of Dange. It took
some more years for the formation the _All-India Workers'
and Peasants' Party_.

Contradictory views were expressed on the "Indian
soil" as to what should be the programme of these new
parties. The programmes of Shingaravelu and Dange devoted
more attention to determine the character of the future
Socialist society. They were weak in organizing agitations
on current issues. Pointing out the fundamental weakness of
this approach, the _Executive Committee_ of the _Communist
International_ appealed to them to confine themselves to the
following fundamental points:

1. Complete separation from imperial connection.
2. Establishment of a democratic republic.
3. Abolition of landlordism and radical readjustment
   of landownership.
4. Nationalisation of the means of transportation and
   other public utilities.
5. 8-hour-day
6. Minimum wages.
7. Workers' councils in factories and peasants' union
   in the villages to protect the interests of the toiling
   masses.

This was the first attempt made under the initiative of
the world Communist movement to organize a party as an
integral party of the world revolutionary movement on the
"Indian soil".

## PESHAWAR AND _KANPUR CONSPIRACY CASES_

The activities carried out with the initiative of MN
Roy under the auspices of the _Communist International_ had
favourable reactions in India. The Communist groups in
Madras, Bombay, Lahore and Calcutta in one way or the
other established contacts with Roy's organization. Attempts
to form a well-organized _Indian Communist Party_ unifying
the activities of the different groups in India went on
vigorously.

Before this reached fruition, however, the rulers launched
their attack. The Indian revolutionaries who were returning
to India from Soviet Russia were arrested _en route_ as
they crossed the Himalayan passes. As cases were launched
in Peshawar now part of Pakistan, they were known as "_Peshawar
Conspiracy Cases_."

In the first case, three persons were involved. The first
accused, Akbar Qureshi, was sentenced to three years' _rigorous
imprisonment_[^rigorous-imprisonment] and the third accused Bahadur to one
year's _rigorous imprisonment_. The second accused, Hafizullah
Khan, was set free as he was found not guilty. The judgement
of this case was pronounced on 31st May 1922.

[^rigorous-imprisonment]: _Rigorous Imprisonment_ as opposed to _Simple imprisonment_ generally involves hard labour while serving sentence in prison.

In the second case, too, there were three accused. The
first accused, Muhammad Akbar (son of the second accused
in the first case), was sentenced to seven years' _rigorous
imprisonment_ and the second accused, Muhammad Hassan,
and the third accused Ghulam Mehboob, were sentenced to
_rigorous imprisonment_ for five years. (All the three had to
undergo solitary confinement for three months. This sentence
was pronounced on 27th April 1923.)

There were eight accused in the third case. In the judgement
pronounced on 18th May 1923, the first accused, Akbar
shah, and the eighth accused, Gaur Rahman, were sentenced
to two years imprisonment while the second accused, Ferozuddin
Mansur, the third accused, Abdul majid, and the sixth
accused, _Sultan_ Muhammad were all sentenced to one year's
imprisonment, while the seventh accused Abdul Quader was
set free as he was found not guilty. Two of the accused,
Ghulam Ahmed and Fida Ali _turned approvers_[^approver].

[^approver]: Under Indian law, an approver is one who gives full disclosure about a crime in return for pardon for his role in such a crime.

Besides, these three cases, a case against Muhammad
Shafiq and another against Fazl Ilahi Qurban were also
launched in Peshawar in 1924 and 1927, respectively. All
these five cases together have come to be known as the _Peshawar
Conspiracy Cases_.

Of these, the first three cases had one feature in common.
Because of the hatred towards the British rule, all of them
had left India as _mujahirs_ (pilgrims) to the Soviet Union.
Inspired by the revolutionary changes there, they were returning
to India. On their way they were arrested and tried.
Although they were pictured by the Government as "Bolshevik
agents" they had no firm commitment to Bolshevism.
The significance of these cases was that they were the first
_conspiracy cases_ instituted in India against the Communist
movement.

A word about the session judge who heard these cases.
The same judge who heard the _Chauri Chaura_ case earlier
was appointed to hear the these cases. In the _Chauri Chaura_
case he had sentenced to death 172 of the 228 accused. In
the Peshawar judgements also, throwing to the winds the
conception of impartiality generally attributed to a judge,
he went to the extent of blindly believing the prosecution
case and convicted the accused.

In an article written on the _Chauri Chaura_ judgement
MN Roy characterized it as "legal murder". The judgements
in _Peshawar conspiracy cases_ too deserved the same
epithet.

As the first _Communist conspiracy cases_, they had their
significance. But the political and cultural level of those
involved in the cases were comparatively low. Except being
accused in these cases, most of them could not contribute
anything substantial to the growth of the _Indian Communist_
movement. As far as we know, it was only Fazl Ilahi Qurban,
the accused in the fifth _Peshawar conspiracy case_
1927. who had played a role to the history of the _Communist
Party of India_.

However, the Government's _anti-Communist_ repressive
actions did not end with the _Peshawar Conspiracy Cases_.
While the second and third cases in this series were in progress,
the Government launched another _conspiracy case_ in
Kanpur, known as the _Kanpur Conspiracy Case_. Since SA
Dange (Bombay) and Muzaffar Ahmed (Calcutta) who later
become prominent Communist leaders as well as MN Roy
were among the accused in this case, the _Kanpur Conspiracy
Case_ gained significance in the history of the _Indian Communist_
movement.

The prosecution case, in brief, was as follows. The
_Communist International_ was a Moscow-based organization
which was trying to end the British rule in India. MN Roy
was essentially the principal agent of that organization engaged
in espionage work for Russia in India and other countries.
There were Bolshevik agents in many places in India working
in accordance with the instruction form that principal
agent. That activity was dangerous to the rule of the British
Crown in India.

The Government first prepared a list of 13 individuals
thus working as "Bolshevik agents". They were MN Roy,
Muzaffar Ahmad, Shaukat Usmani, Ghulam Hussain, SA
Dange, M. Shingaravelu Chettiar, R.C.L. Sharma, Nalini
Gupta, Shamsuddin Hasan, M.P.S. Velayudhan, Dr. Manilal,
Dr. Sampurnanand and Sathyabhakta.

They were included in the list as important persons
among those who were in one way or another connected with
Roy and with propagating the literature published under his
leadership. But after scrutiny, five names were struck off
the list. Thus, when the hearings commenced, only the first
eight of the above list remained. Others escaped prosecution.

There was an important difference between the Peshawar
cases and the present one. In the Peshawar cases, the outlook
of the accused was how to extricate themselves form the
accusation. The Kanpur accused, on the other hand, considered
the court as a platform to counter the political attack
of the Government. (The Meerut accused too adopted the
same approach). The examples of the trials in the history
of the world Communist movement from that of Marx in
the _Cologne case_ to that of Dimitory in the _Reichstag Arson
case_ was first emulated in India by the accused in the _Kanpur
Conspiracy Case_ of 1923--24.

Both the Government which decided to conduct the
_Kanpur Conspiracy Case_ and its accused Muzaffar Ahmad
and others (the first accused Roy was not in India) had the
same approach towards the conduct of the case. More than
getting the accused convicted, the Government was interested
in exposing the "danger of Bolshevism". The prosecution
utilized all its ingenuity to show that the theory and practice
of Communism was shocking to anyone who had "loyalty
to Indian culture and appreciation for its moral values".
On the contrary, the accused, through their affidavits and
arguments, tried to expose the true colour of the British rule
in India and to make clear the inevitability of adopting a
revolutionary path against it. In other words, the Government
tried to show that the theory and practice of the
Communists were in no way acceptable to the Indian people,
while the accused tried to establish that the revolutionary
path open to the people of India as in the case of other
countries was that of Communism.

Internationally too, it became a great sensation, because
for the first time in Britain, the _Labour Party_ with Ramsay
MacDonald as Prime Minister was in power. The accused
in the _Kanpur Conspiracy Case_ which was being conducted
in accordance with the direction of that Government were
those who were trying to form a working class party in India.
Though with an outlook and programme different from that
of the _British Labour Party_, Roy, Muzaffar Ahmad, Dange
and other accused were striving to form a political party on
the organized strength of the working class. The opinion
that it was a paradox which should not be allowed to continue
was gaining strength among the workers and their leaders of
Britain and other European countries. In many countries
attempts were made to exert pressure on the British government
to withdraw the prosecution.

In India, arrangements were made to form defence
committees to render assistance to the accused. Even _non-Communist_
nationalists and democrats, _congressmen_ and
other _anti-imperialist_ minded people realized the political
significance of the case in that the government was attacking
to destroy revolutionary political activities as a whole by
raising the bogey of "Communist conspiracy". We shall see
later on that this was true of the _Meerut conspiracy case_
also. The case helped to generate a sense of willingness
among the people to support the Communists, a reaction
which was quite the reverse of what the government had
hoped for at the time of filing the case.

Two of the eight accused, MN Roy and RCL
Sharma, did not appear before the court, since the former
was in Germany and the latter in Pondicherry, then a French
possession in India. Shingaravelu Chettiar was granted bail
on account of old age and ill-health. The Kanpur court did
not try him. (After the pronouncement of the judgement, the
Government of India advised the Government of Madras to
proceed against Shingaravelu if it deemed it necessary.) Of
the remaining five, Gulam Hussain turned _approver_ and
consequently, the government withdrew the prosecution against
him. The remaining four, Muzaffar Ahmed, Shaukat Usmani,
Dange and Nalini Gupta were sentenced to four years'
_rigorous imprisonment_.

Though the _Kanpur Conspiracy Case_ ended with this,
its repercussions continued. The accused had used the
courtroom as a platform to propagate the theory of
Communism and the political programme based on it. And it
became quite effective. Though connected with the national
freedom movement under the leadership of the Congress,
the idea to form a working class party independent of it,
with an outlook and programme of its own, received wider
recognition than ever before. The type of party proposed by
Roy in his letters to Singaravelu Chettiar, Dange, Muzaffar
Ahmed and others had not yet been formed. It may appear
to be a paradox that the initiative to form such a party came
from an unexpected quarters. But that was what happened.

The accused had maintained before the court their legal
right to organize a party in the very name of a _Communist
party_. They had also pointed out the fact that Communist
parties were functioning in many countries, including Britain.
Even the position of the prosecution was not that Communist
ideas were illegal. The ruling circles had declared in and
outside the Parliament that it was not Communism they had
put in the dock, but the conspiracies to destroy the British rule
in India by use of force on the instructions received from
Moscow.

Witnessing all these developments, a Congressman by
name Satyabhakta (an accused in the first list of _Kanpur
Conspiracy Case_) began an attempt to form in quite a legal
way a _Communist party_, without connection with Moscow.
In 1925, the Congress session was meeting at Kanpur.
Satyabhakta proposed the holding of an all-India conference
of Communists who supported his ideas, at Kanpur at the
time of the Congress session there. He had already formed
an organization, named the _Indian Communist Party_ (confined
to Kanpur). He put forward the suggestion to hold
the conference as the secretary of that party.

At that time, though Dange, Muzaffar Ahmed and
others were in jail as the accused in the Kanpur case, their
close colleagues were outside. Muzaffar Ahmad was later
released on the grounds of ill-health. Hence, many including
Muzaffar Ahmad accepted the invitation of Satyabhakta
and attended the _All-India Communist Conference_ at Kanpur.
Among those who attended the conference were SV Ghate,
KN Joglekar, Ayodhya Prasad and others who were later
implicated in the _Meerut Conspiracy Case_. The welcome
speech of Hazrat Mohani, the presidential address by
Singaravelu Chettiar and other proceedings of the conference
got wide publicity in the newspapers in India and abroad.

But, as the proceedings of the conference progressed, two
distinct trends of thought emerged. Satyabhakta pleaded that
the party should have no links with the _Communist International_.
The large majority of the delegates under the
leadership of Muzaffar Ahmad, Ghate and others opposed
this. Serious differences arose regarding the name of the
party itself --- -whether it should he '_Communist Party of
India_' or '_Indian Communist Party_'. Here too the issue
involved was the same: whether it should function in India
as part of the world Communist movement or as a _Communist
party_ particularly for India. On this issue, Satyabhakta
was defeated. Other Communists had the majority.

The conference adopted a constitution for the party and
formed a central committee with two General Secretaries, SV
Ghate and JP Bagerhatta. Thus, for the first time a
_Communist party_ was born on the Indian soil"in a conference
with delegates from the different provinces in India.

However, it cannot be said that with this the obstructions
before the party for its growth had been removed. The fact
was that the Central Committee thus formed could not
function in a continuous manner. Whatever organization
formed was broken up with the institution of the _Meerut
Conspiracy Case_ implicating many prominent Communists
including Ghate, one of the secretaries of the party. Only
the central committee which was reorganized after the
comrades accused in the Meerut case were released from jail
could provide a continuous all-India leadership.

The Kanpur conference played an important role in
paving the way for the formation of an organization permanently
functioning under the leadership of the Central
Committee reorganized in 1933. The conference held
earlier at Tashkent and the committee formed there under
the leadership of Roy did play their respective roles in
creating conditions for holding the Kanpur conference. That
is, if Tashkent was the first step in the growth of the
Communist movement in India, the second was Kanpur.
The Communist movement which the authorities tried to
crush through the _Kanpur Conspiracy Case_, in effect, became
an organized force.
