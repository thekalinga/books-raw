# THE WAVELL PLAN

## THE _SIMLA CONFERENCE_

Within four months after the Desai-Liaqat talks broke off,
Germany surrendered to the _Allied forces_. With this
the argument of the British that conceding India's demand
for independence during the war would defeat the British
war efforts became irrelevant. In the circumstance, they
realized the need to give up their adamant attitude and to take
the initiative to resolve the political crisis in India. In Britain,
the war-time coalition government collapsed and the
Conservative and Labour parties started competing with each
other for political power. It was in this situation that the
Viceroy was called to London. Since the war was still going ,
on and also since there was a difference of opinion between
the conservative and Labour leaders on Indian problems,
decisions were delayed and as a consequence, the Viceroy
had to prolong his stay in London. Finally, Wavell's earlier
plan was accepted in a new form.

The next problem was how to form a government
at the centre as envisaged in the Wavell Plan.

It was decided to convene a conference of the principal
political parties and communities in India as a preliminary
to the formation of the government as soon as Wavell returned
to India. Accordingly, the British government made an
announcement that a conference would be held in Simla on 25th June 1945 to discuss matters relating to the formation
of a government at the Centre.

Among those to be invited to the conference would
include the Chief Ministers of the existing ministries in the
provinces and the last Chief Ministers who were in office in
those provinces in which the Governor's rule was in force.
That is, since the Chief Ministers in the provinces in which
ministries were existing were either _League_ leaders or _non-League_
Muslim leaders and all the former Chief Ministers in
the provinces in which Governor's rule were _Congressmen_,
these two parties would be represented in the conference.
Others would include the leader of the Congress Party and
the Deputy Leader of the _League_ Party in the Central Legislative
Assembly and also Gandhi and Jinnah, the supreme
leaders of the Congress and the _League_, respectively. In
addition, there would be one delegate each representing the
Sikh community and the Scheduled Castes. As soon as the
announcement on the conference was made, the members of
the _Congress Working Committee_ were released from prison.

However, Gandhi wrote to the Viceroy informing him
that in place of himself, the Congress would be represented
by the Congress President, Abul Kalam Azad and that he
and the members of the _Congress Working Committee_ would
be present at Simla during the conference. This change was,
in fact, the beginning of a dispute which was repeatedly raised
later in the proceedings of the conference.

Jinnah's argument was that the Congress did not represent
the Indian people as a whole and that it was the organization
of Hindus and that too, of _Caste Hindus_. If Azad
attended the conference, this argument would be falsified, and
consequently it was necessary for the _League_ to make out that
the Congress was represented by Gandhi in the conference.
The design of the British was to weaken the position of the
Congress as ever before by conceding the claim of the _League_.
Wavell's proposal was part of this design. But, as Gandhi
made it clear that neither he nor the _Working Committee_ was
ready to accept this proposal, Wavell was compelled to invite
Azad as the President of the Congress. Besides, there was
Dr. Khan Sahib from the NWF Province among the former
Chief Ministers. Punjab Chief Minister Khizr Hyat Khan
was not a _League_ man. Thus, Jinnah had to participate in
a conference to which these _non-League_ Muslim leaders were
also the delegates.

However, the Congress was unable to consistently
adhere the stand taken by Gandhi. Although Azad as Congress
President represented the organization, it deputed
Pandit Pant to hold private negotiations with Jinnah outside
the conference. Gandhi and other Congress leaders knew
that Azad holding private negotiations with Jinnah as Congress
President would do more harm than good.

The same problem was brought up in the formal session
of the conference in a different from. According to Jinnah,
the Congress was the representative of ninety percent of the
Hindus, while there were ninety percent or more Muslims
in the _League_. Therefore, he insisted that there should be no
_non-League_ Muslim ministers in the proposed ministry. In
the list submitted by the Congress to the Viceroy the names
of Abul Kalam Azad and Asaf Ali were included. The first
session of the conference ended without arriving at a decision.

In order to break the deadlock, the Viceroy proposed
a new formula. He would prepare a list of names whom he
considered necessary to be included in the ministry and show
the relevant part of the list to the leader of each party. A
final decision would be taken after holding discussions with
all concerned. Since there was no alternative left, this proposal
was accepted. But the list prepared by the Viceroy
was not acceptable to Jinnah. For, although the names of
Azad and Asaf Ali did not figure in the list, it contained the
name of a representative of the _Unionist Party_ of Punjab.
As such, if the list was accepted by Jinnah, it would invalidate
his claim that the _League_ was the sole representative
of the Muslims. Finally, when the last session of the conference
was held on 14th July, the Viceroy declared that the
discussions had failed for the time being. He added that he
would not blame any party which had participated in the
conference except himself for the failure.

The role played by the Viceroy and the leaders of the
Congress and the _League_ throughout the conference had
been criticized by many quarters. In Britain itself the Viceroy
had been blamed for his unwillingness to continue
discussions on the basis of his own list when Jinnah rejected it.
These critics pointed out that had Wavell stood firm on his
position, Jinnah would have climbed down. There were
indications to the effect that the influence of the _League_ in
the NWF Province, Punjab and Bengal was weaker as
compared to the non-Muslim majority provinces and that
certain top Muslim leaders like Liaquat Ali Khan were
opposed to Jinnah's adamant attitude.

The approach adopted by the Congress following the
failure of the _Simla Conference_ is noteworthy. President
Azad disagreed with the statement of the Viceroy owning
the responsibility for the failure of the Conference. He and
other Congress leaders stated that the _League_ and Jinnah were
responsible for its failure. Gandhi, on the other hand, stated
that since the gulf between the Congress and the _League_
and between Hindus and Muslims had become unbridgeable,
the mediation of the British was necessary. Although this
statement created surprise and anger among the people including
Gandhi's followers, none of them entertained any
hope about the future of India. They felt helpless before
the obstinacy of Jinnah and Britain's encouragement to it.

The critics of Wavell including the leaders of the
Congress and other non-Muslim organizations believed that
if Wavell had stood firm on his proposal, the partition of
India could have been avoided. They reasoned that if the
_League_ had to remain without sharing power while the
Congress remained in power, a sense of helplessness would
have spread among the leadership and ranks of the _League_
leading it to accept the proposal of Wavell.

This cannot be dismissed as meaningless. A section of the
Muslim leaders in Punjab and Bengal had felt apprehended
that if the slogan of Pakistan was to come into effect, their
provinces would be partitioned as part of partition of India,
Therefore they had been trying to keep their provinces away
from the agitation for Pakistan. If there had been an indication
that the British would not accept any demand raised by
Jinnah, the _Unionist Party_ in Punjab and the _Krishak Praja
Party_ in Bengal could have opposed more vigorously the
demand for the partition of India. The very existence of a
Congress ministry in the Muslim majority NWF Province
was a weak point for the _League_.

However, as we have indicated above, the Indian politics
had, in general, been divided into two. Although there
were large sections of people in the Muslim majority provinces
opposed to the partition of India, the demand of
Pakistan had started to be raised all over India. A new
(_bourgeois_) class interested in this was growing among the
Muslims. The _League_ leadership had been able to fan the
fire of anti-Congress feelings among the masses to protect
the interests of this class.

It is not difficult to find that even if it was possible to
create a Muslim political leadership parallel to the _League_,
the British rulers would have been the real beneficiaries of
such an exercise. The Muslim leaders, whom the people knew
were attached to the British, appearing on the scene against
the _Muslim League_ would not affect the strength of the
_League_. The purpose of Wavell's proposal to form a government
with representation to the _Unionist Party_ was, in fact,
to bring such people to the scene. Instead of exposing this
as part of an imperialist design, the Congress leaders were
praising the "neutrality of Wavell". This was what was
meant by the statements of Azad and Gandhi that the person
responsible for the failure of the conference was Jinnah and
not Wavell and that the British would have to mediate in
the dispute between the Congress and the _League_.

## "COMMUNISTS IN THE OTHER CAMP"

With the release of the _Congressmen_ from prison before
and after the _Simla Conference_, the Congress which had
been remaining inactive for the past three years became
active again. Jawaharlal Nehru provided the Congress
workers with a new theme for political propaganda, the theme
that while the Congressmen were engaged in a grim fight
against the British government, the Communists were in the
other camp. This strengthened the _anti-Communist_ feeling
which was widespread among the ranks of the Congress
who had been conducting secret campaigns while their leaders
were in jail. Thus, Nehru who unambiguously proclaimed
a decade ago that there were only two paths Open
before the world, the paths of Communism and fascism,
and that he chose the path of Communism, now turned himself
into a top ranking leader of _anti-Communist_ propaganda.
The "crime" committed by the Communist was that they
adhered to the stand adopted by Nehru and Azad until the
adoption of the _Quit India Resolution_ by the Congress and
accordingly carried on political activities during the _Quit
India Struggle_ with the view that nothing should be done
which might be helpful to the Japanese and German
aggressors! This may sound strange.

But, if one examines the class content of Nehru's
"left-wing" politics, it can be seen that there is nothing
strange about the transformation Nehru had undergone in a
decade. As Gandhi before the Lahore Congress and Birla
and other big capitalists immediately after the _Lucknow
Congress_ had shown, Nehru was a _bourgeois_ leader prone
to be "tamed" by Gandhi and capitalists like Birla. Nehru's
"left-wing" politics was helpful to draw workers and other
toiling people to the _bourgeois_ politics of the Congress.

Besides, the _Congress Socialist Party_ under the leadership
of Jayaprakash Narayan was a "Socialist" party
functioning within the general framework of the discipline
of the Congress. The _Communist Party_ which had just
been reorganized after freeing itself from the repercussions
of repressions for a long time and from inner party rivalries
had not yet been a strong party. Thus, in the 1930s when
a strong left movement was not in existence, Nehru's "leftwing"
politics would not pose danger either to the economic
interests of the capitalists or to the political leadership of
Gandhi and other right-wing leaders. Consequently, Nehru,
who was subservient to Gandhi's leadership, did not feel
that the _Communist Party_ was a dangerous force.

But the growth the _Communist Party_ had achieved
during the last couple of years was contrary to the expectations
of Nehru and other leaders. Despite the fact that it
had to face strong opposition from a majority of the
_non-Communist_ _anti-imperialists_ at a time when it had to
swim against the popular current of the _Quit India Struggle_,
the _Communist Party_ had risen to the position of a party
standing firmly on its own. The _Communist Party_ had acquired
the status as the only party enjoying popular support
widely in Kerala, Andhra and Bengal, and locally in many
other provinces, as a party which deserved to be considered
as a political force capable of challenging the Congress in the future.
The growth of the Party which had considerable
influence among the different sections of the people like
workers, peasants and students had become a threat to the
Congress.

It must be specifically stated that in addition to this
political propaganda carried out against the Communists,
they also took certain organized actions. It was in this period
that efforts were made by them to establish trade unions and
student organizations subservient to the Congress politics as
against the mass organizations like the _AITUC_ and _AISF_ in
which the Communists had a leading role. Efforts made to
establish their own organizations by disrupting these mass
organizations which were dealing with problems of life of the
people above party politics and accepting the general outlook
of national independence, democracy and Socialism brought
the _Congressmen_ later to maintain without any compunction
that class organizations of workers, peasants and other
sections of the masses were the "_feeder organizations_" of
the Congress. The disunity which we find today in the trade
unions and other mass organizations is the evil results of the
efforts being made by other parties to establish their own
"_feeder organizations_" following the footsteps of the
Congress.

This is undoubtedly a political approach which is against
the interests of the working class and other toiling masses.
If trade unions, peasant organizations and other mass organizations
had to function as _feeder organizations_ of this or
that political party, the entire mass organizations would become
subservient to _bourgeois_-_petty bourgeois_ politics. For
this reason, Communists have always raised the slogan of _one
union in one industry_. The formation of the _Indian National
Trade Union Congress (INTUC)_ under the leadership of
Sardar Patel in 1945--46 constituted the first act of cutting at
the roots of this principle.

We have noted earlier the formation of a peculiar
kind of workers' association in Ahmedabad a quarter of
a century prior to this directly under the leadership of
Gandhi. It was formed as an 'apolitical' organization
dealing only with the economic problems of the workers.
But even the Congress leaders in other places were not prepared
to accept this theory. On the contrary, many prominent
Congress leaders had played important roles in the formation
and growth of the _AITUC_ which was an organization based
on an _anti-imperialist_ and pro-Socialist political approach.
By 1935--36, Nehru himself came up with the proposal to strengthen
the Congress by giving the independently functioning
mass organizations like trade unions and peasant organizations
collective affiliation to the Congress. At this stage the
right-wing Congress leaders raised the argument that such
mass organizations should function subject to the discipline
of the Congress. We have described earlier the clash which
took place between the right and left wings in the Congress
in the 1930s on this issue.

By the end of the Second World War and of the _Quit
India Struggle_, the _Communist Party_ with an independent
working class outlook and a programme of action challenging
the political leadership of the Congress had spread all
over the country along with a number of mass organizations
on which the Party had considerable influence. It became
clear that forming apolitical mass organizations as did Gandhi
in the earlier years or bringing under the leadership of
the Congress the mass organizations handling left-wing politics
as Nehru tried to do later was impracticable. The
Congress leaders feared that mass organizations with leftist
orientation, in the activities of which had _Congressmen_ also
participated, was dangerous to the political existence of the
Congress. Thus, the Congress leaders came forward to form
the INTUC and the _National Students Organization_.

The political background of the formation of these
organizations is notable. The historical role played by the
Soviet Union in the Second World War had helped to spread
the ideology of Socialism. Among the younger generation who
had entered the _Quit India Struggle_ responding to the call
given by Gandhi and Bose, there were wide-spread feelings
of sympathy to Communism and hatred towards Communists
in India. The _Congressmen_ with these feelings as well as
the Communists were working among the masses in accordance
with their respective outlooks.

The economic situation that developed soon after the
end of the war was such that it provided opportunities to
all political parties and groups to carry on their activities
extensively. The famine which broke out during and after
the war, the increase in the prices of essential articles, the
decrease in the real income of wage earners and similar other
hardships gave impetus to organized struggles of workers and
middle class employees. The food scarcity that prevailed
during the war became acute in 1945. According to the
estimate of the Viceroy, Lord Wavell, about 100 million
people were affected by scarcity. At the same time, a small
minority consisting of landlords and wholesale merchants
made enormous profits by hoarding and black-marketing.
People in thousands staged demonstrations and resorted to
other forms of agitation in protest against scarcity, price
rise and black-marketing.

The existence and the activities of trade unions and
other mass organizations which, though above party politics,
had been considerably influenced by the left political forces,
would no doubt bring about a political situation unfavourable
to the _bourgeois_ leadership of the Congress and to the economic
interests of the _bourgeois_-landlord classes. The only
way for the Congress to avoid such a situation was to stand
in the forefront in giving shape to this mounting mass protests.
The INTUC created by Sardar Patel and other Congress
leaders and the rhetorics of Nehru that boarders and black
marketeers should be hanged on the lamp post were intended
to serve this purpose.

In carrying out this scheme it was convenient to concentrate
attacks on the Communists. This was because the
Socialists who had earned prestige through their participation
in the _Quit India Struggle_ and other leftist _Congressmen_ who
were the followers of Subhas Bose were most revengeful
towards the Communists and any political offensive against
the Communists would be welcomed by them. The _Congressmen_
would get the support of these leftists in forming rival
trade unions and mass organizations against those under
the leadership of the Communists.

The _anti-Communist_ political campaign started by Nehru
and other top Congress leaders with the support of the Socialists
and the supporters of Subhas Bose and their scheme to
split mass organizations created difficulties for the Communists
comparable to those they had to face during the _Quit
India Struggle_. Once again they were facing a situation in
which they had to move against the current of _anti-imperialist_
sentiment of a considerable section of the people led by the
Congress.

However, there was a difference in the conditions then
and now. Then the Congress was engaged in an open _anti-imperialist_
struggle. The Communists had to work in those
days by keeping themselves away from that struggle and
cautioning the people that entering into that struggle would
be suicidal. That was not the situation now. The Congress
now was engaged not in an _anti-imperialist_ struggle but in
an effort to negotiate with the imperialists and achieve something
less than _full independence_. Nehru who was shouting
that the Communists were in the other camp and rallying
the people against them was now proceeding from there
straight into the viceregal palace in Simla. All the prominent
Congress leaders including Gandhi were engaged in a bargain
with the representatives of the British government.

The fundamental contradiction between the Socialists
and the supporters of Bose who could not emotionally adjust
with the politics of bargain, on the one hand, and the GandhiNehru
group, on the other, could not but surface before long.
The Communists, on the other hand, were in a position in
which they could involve themselves fully in the rising mass
upsurge. The repercussions of this could not but appear in
Indian politics in the near future.

## SECOND EDITION OF WAVELL PLAN

The _Simla Conference_ broke off at a time when important
developments were taking place in the world. As we have
noted, the conference was held after the defeat of Germany.
Before long Japan too surrendered marking the complete
defeat of the fascist and militarist powers in the Second
World War. In Britain, one of the _anti-fascist_ powers, the
_Labour Party_ came to power defeating the conservatives in
the elections.

As for India, this political change in Britain did not
produce any immediate effect. Attlee's _Labour Party_ had all
along been with Churchill's conservative Party in dealing
with the _Quit India Struggle_, in calling the _Simla Conference_
and in all the policies and approaches towards India. But it
was generally regarded that the _Labour Party_'s policies were
relatively more favourable to India. Therefore, the _Labour
Party_ had the obligation to live up to the expectation arising
out of this general belief. Consequently, the British government
took steps to restart negotiations with Indian political
leaders soon after the end of the _Simla Conference_, Lord
Wavell was called to London and after consultations with the
British government he made a declaration on 18th September.
One new element contained in the declaration was the government's
intention to immediately hold elections to the Central
and Provincial Assemblies.

The elections to the existing Central Assembly were
held in 1935 and to the Provincial Assemblies in 1937, and
the life of these legislative bodies were extended considering
the war-time situations. Therefore, the decision to hold elections
now was quite natural. However, the election contemplated
now was not an ordinary routine one; it was, rather,
considered as a means to find a solution to the constitutional
problems on which the _Simla Conference_ failed to take a
decision. In the declaration, Wavell stated that it was the
intention of the British government to constitute as soon as
possible a constitution-making body. Soon after the elections,
discussions would be held with the representatives of the
provincial legislatures to ascertain their opinions in this
regard. Discussions would also be held with the representatives
of the _Princely States_ to find out in what way they
would be able to participate in the proposed constitution-making
body.

Wavell said that the government was going to examine
the question of signing a pact between Britain and India. There
were also the problems relating to the day-to-day administration
of the country in the midst of making arrangements
for transfer of power and India's participation in promoting
a new international order. For these purposes, actions would
be taken soon after the declaration of the result of elections
to provincial legislatures to constitute an Executive Council
at the Centre.

Clearly, this was a continuation of the negotiations
conducted by Cripps in 1942 and by Wavell in June-July 1945. Here also there are two central problems for which
solutions had to be found. First, what should be the nature
of India's future constitution and what would be the status
of the different communities including the Hindus and Muslims
in it? Second, what should be the form and structure
of the government which should be in existence in India
while framing the future constitution?

While the major problem that stood in the way of finding
a solution to these questions during the _Cripps mission_
was the difference of opinion between the British government
and the Congress, it was the difference of opinion between
the Congress and the _League_ that led to the failure of the
_Simla Conference_. There was serious difference of opinion
between the Congress and the _League_ with regard to the proposals
making a distinction between Hindu majority provinces
and Muslim majority provinces and specifying their
respective roles in the constitution-making processes. There
was a wide gap between the Congress which was trying its
utmost to keep India undivided and the _League_ which was
trying to ensure that the constitution-making process would
proceed in such a way as would lead to the formation of
Pakistan. Similar difference of opinion on the question of the
formation of the interim government as well as on the share
which each party should get in it. These were the differences
that led the _Simla Conference_ to break down.

Now the government had come up with the proposal to
hold elections as a solution to this problem. The result would
test the popular support of the Congress and the _League_,
Besides, the next series of discussions on constitution-making
would be held not with the leaders of the Congress and
the _League_ but with the representatives of provincial legislatures
which would come into being following the elections to
the legislatures of the Muslim and non-Muslim majority provinces.
Consequently, other parties and political forces would
also be able to exert influence in the discussions on constitution-making.
If the _Muslim League_ had the support of ninety
percent of the Muslim masses, as it claimed it did, then the
_League_ would be able to carry matters in such a way as would
lead to the formation of Pakistan through the representatives
of the Muslim majority provinces. On the contrary, if the
claim made by the Congress that it enjoyed the support of
a considerable section among the Muslims, it would be able
to preserve the integrity of India with the help of the representatives
of the Muslim majority provinces. Thus, the
questions of framing the future constitution of India and the
formation of an interim government were deferred to a later
time after the elections.

As for the Congress, this was a totally unsatisfactory
and deplorable step. According to Pattabhi Sitaramayya,
the Viceroy's deviation had not recognized India's independence.
For another six months ministries in the provinces
would not be formed. Nor would the government at the
Centre be reorganized. A corrupt administration would continue
when the country was passing though a critical situation.
Although it was promised that the elections would be based
on a carefully prepared voters' list, there was widespread
discontent on the mode of preparation of the list.

In September 1945, the _AICC_ met at Bombay to evaluate
the new political situation and formulate the Congress
policy. Although the government had debarred many prominent
_Congressmen_ from contesting the elections, the _AICC_
decided to contest the elections. A seven-member sub-committee
was appointed for this purpose. The _AICC_ prepared
a manifesto which reflected the prestige the Congress had
been able to gain during and after the _Quit India Struggle_
as well as the revolutionary spirit of its ranks. The manifesto
had placed particular emphasis on the fundamental rights
of the citizens demanded through a resolution at the Karachi
Congress, the need for the reconstruction of Indian economy
which had remained stagnant under the foreign domination
for the past one and a half centuries and the importance of
a programme to solve the problems of life of the poor,
particularly the problems of land relations. Through the
manifesto the Congress claimed itself to be the organization
representing the whole India people and that it was striving
to lead India to independence and democracy. Reminding
the people that the election was only a beginning of the coming
mass struggles, the manifesto called upon the people to
support the Congress in the elections as well as in the
forthcoming struggles.

The manifesto did not overtly criticize other political
parties. But, as we have indicated earlier, the Congress
leaders had unleashed an aggressive political campaign against
the _Communist Party_. Similarly, the Congress campaigners
mounted a powerful attack on the _League_. Briefly, the Congress
got engaged in a campaign to run all other parties down
by accusing them of being the tools of the British rulers.

The _Muslim League_, on the other hand, utilized the
election campaign to rally the entire Muslim community
behind the slogan of Pakistan and to demolish the claims of
the Congress. To suit this purpose, the _League_ refrained
from opposing other minority communities and organizations
in order to widen the gulf between them and the Congress. It
got engaged in the efforts to enhance its prestige and to weaken
the Congress to the extent possible in order to consolidate
its position in the interim government at the Centre and in
the ministries in the provinces which would be formed after
the elections.

In brief, the principal issues which were raised at the Simla
Conference and the claims made by the Congress and the
_League_ were presented before the voters. The election provided
the opportunity for the formation of two mutually
opposing camps around these issues. It transformed itself into
an open clash on the question of the share the Congress and
the _League_ should get in the power to be transferred and in
the interim government which was going to be formed after
the elections.

Without joining either of these camps and independent
of them, the _Communist Party_ came forward to approach
the people in keeping with the interests of the working people,
holding aloft the banner of real democracy. It was for
the first time that the Party was contesting elections on a
wide scale on its own programmes and demands. This was
a pointer to the future.

However, the main forces in the election arena were
the Congress and the _League_. The programmes and the slogans
of the _Communist Party_ could not gain country wide
recognition over and above the contests between the Congress
and the _League_. That is, the _Communist Party_ did not come
to the stage as a force capable of playing an effective role
in the process of constitution-making.

The elections ended by creating a political atmosphere
which was likely to accentuate the problems that came up
before the _Simla Conference_, rather than solving them. The
millions who rallied behind the Congress and the _League_
stood more resolutely behind them and the demands raised
by the leaders of these parties received added strength.
There were indications to the effect that if the British government
refused to accept the demands raised by them, they
might launch a mass struggle to achieve them. Briefly
speaking, the second edition of the Wavell plan, like the
earlier one, proved futile.
