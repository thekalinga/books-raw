# TOWARDS THE LEFT AGAIN

## TOWARDS _ANTI-IMPERIALIST_ UNITY

As evident in the decisions taken by the _Working Committee_
meeting held in the middle of 1935, a vast change had come
about in the policies of the Congress leadership following
the adoption of electoral programme by the Congress. One
of the resolutions adopted by the Committee concerned
the directive as to how the _Independence Day_ should be
observed in the new situation.

Earlier, the _Independence Day_ was being observed in
an atmosphere charged with intense _anti-imperialist_ feelings.
For instance, it was first observed in 1930 as a preparation
for the coming _Salt Satyagraha_ and in the subsequent years
it was observed as part of the ongoing _civil disobedience_
struggle. In contrast to this, it is now going to be observed
for the first in a manner unrelated to any such struggle.
Thus, the _Working Committee_ appealed to the Congress
workers not to violate any of the existing laws and not to
observe _hartal_ as part of the observance of the _Independence
Day_.

The _Working Committee_, however, did not stop at that.
It may be recalled that in December 1934, the Committee
had directed the Congress members in the Central Assembly
to argue vigorously against the reforms proposals of the
British government and also to act unitedly, to the extent
possible, with the _Nationalist Party_ and the Jinnah group
for that purpose. Now the _Working Committee_ was asking
the _Congressmen_ to utilize the _Full Independence Day_ observance
to get the people adopt a resolution containing not a bit
of this politics.

In place of the earlier practice of inspiring the people
to take the Fun _Independence Day_ pledge by exposing the
British rule and exploitation and calling upon the people to
rise against them, the _Working Committee_ this time asked
the people to take a pledge to implement the Gandhian _constructive
programme_ of communal unity, prohibition of liquor,
hand-spinning and promotion of village industries and
using exclusively _Khadi_ and other products of village industries,
ending untouchability, helping the poor, etc. These
were considered as a means to show the essential qualities of
_truth and non-violence_.

While directing the people to implement this typical
Gandhian programme, the resolution included in a formal
way the preliminary:

>We remind ourselves on this, the solemn
national day, that _Complete Independence_ is our birth-right, and we shall not rest till we have achieved it.

There was another equally important resolution. There
was an official announcement that the year 1935 was to be
celebrated as the Silver Jubilee of "His Britannic Majesty's
reign" in India as elsewhere in the empire. Therefore, the
question whether _Congressmen_ should take part in these celebrations
came up before the _Working Committee_. A resolution
adopted in this connection stated:

>The Congress bas
and can have nothing but good wishes for the personal well-being
of His Majesty, but the Congress cannot ignore the fact
that the rule in India with which His Majesty is naturally
identified has been a positive hindrance to the political,
moral and material growth of the nation. It now threatens
to culminate in a constitution which, if enforced, promises
to exploit the nation, to drain her of what she still possesses
of wealth and to harden her political subjection as has perhaps
never been attempted before. It is, therefore, impossible
for the _Working Committee_ to advise any participation
in the forthcoming celebration.

The resolution added:

>At
the same time the _Working Committee_ has no desire, by
hostile demonstrations, to wound the susceptibilities of
Englishmen and others who will want to take part in the
celebrations.
 
That is, the people concerned should remain "satisfied with mere abstention from events" connected with
the celebration.

The resolution urged upon the authorities and responsible
Englishmen to "recognise and appreciate the honest and
inevitable attitude of the _Working Committee_" and to "refrain
from unnecessarily wounding national self-respect by
compelling, directly or indirectly, participation in the forthcoming
celebrations".

Considering the political background in which the
_Working Committee_ took these decisions, it is not difficult to
discern that the leadership was acting against the intense
feelings of the masses and the ordinary _Congressmen_. Many
prominent _Congressmen_ including Nehru, Bose and Gaffar
Khan were in prison. Thousands of Congress Workers were
similarly in prisons in Bengal and the Frontier Province.
The law muzzling the press and other emergency laws were
being effectively enforced.

The Congress leadership was being compelled to adopt
resolutions protesting against these repressive actions and to
call upon the people to observe a _protest day_. The observance
of the _Protest Day_ in accordance with its call in the
different parts of the country came under the heavy attack of
the government. The authorities were, on the other hand,
imposing the reforms proposal which was unacceptable even
to those sections of the _Congressmen_ working in accordance
with the parliamentary programme and, on the other, unleashing
repression on tens of thousands of ordinary Congress
workers and leaders who were not prepared to lower the
banner of the _anti-British_ struggle.

In this atmosphere, popular feelings against the right-wing
Congress leadership began to grow both inside and
outside the Congress and the Socialists, Communists and
other leftists tried to give these feelings an organized form.
We have already seen that these groups came together against
the policies of Gandhi and other right-wing leaders in
the Bombay session. But they knew that uniting the leftwing
_Congressmen_ against the _rightist_ tendency in the Congress
alone was not sufficient to solve the problem. It may
be noted that the confrontation between the left-wing and
right-wing in the Congress was taking place at a time when
the tide of new struggles was rising high in the country.
The leftist groups also participated actively in these struggles
and gave them a unified leadership.

At the time when the Congress leadership decided to withdraw
the _civil disobedience movement_ and adopt the electoral
programme, the working class movement in the country
was preparing for action. The beginning of 1934 witnessed
a new movement among the workers of textile mills in
Bombay and several other places. In April and May, more
than 100,000 workers went on strike in many places like
Bombay, Kanpur, Delhi and Nagpur. After holding out for
two months they were forced to return to work without
getting any of their demands conceded on account of a number
of factors like government repression, split in the trade
union movement and the acute unemployment prevailing in
the country.

Although the strike ended in failure, it was of historical
importance to the Indian working class movement. The
_AITUC_ and the _National Trade Union Federation_ which
was broken away from the former a few years back
came together to conduct the strike. Besides, the _Red Trade
Union Federation_ (another break away group of _AITUC_)
led by Communists, the _Royist group_ which was opposed to
the Communists at the national and international levels,
the _Congress Socialists_ who were just entering the trade union
movement in an organized manner and other leftist _Congressmen_
rallied together behind the strike movement. Thus,
all the political groups inside and outside the Congress came
together above party rivalries and conflicts to organize the
struggle based on the day-to-day demands of the workers.

This unity was not, however, confined to organizing
the struggle. Towards the end of 1934, the _AITUC_, the
_Red TUC_, the _National Trade Union Federation_ and the
_Congress Socialist Party_ reached an agreement to conduct
_anti-imperialist_ demonstrations throughout the country. It
was an attempt made to transform the working class which
was launching strikes and other forms of struggles for their
economic demands into an organized mass force based on
_anti-imperialist_ politics and also to bring other _anti-imperialists_
outside the working class into the movement. Needless
to say, this was also an attempt to draw those _Congressmen_
who were moving towards the left against the policies of
their right-wing leadership, into the trade union movement.

It must be stated specifically that, thanks to these efforts,
in April 1935 the _Red TUC_ again merged with the _AITUC_
which became an organization in which the Communists, the
_Royist group_s and the _Congress Socialists_ worked shoulder to
shoulder, leaving only the _National Trade Union Federation_
founded by the 'moderates' like NM Joshi and VV Giri
outside the _AITUC_.

Though not as organized as the working class movement,
a new upsurge was discernible among the peasants also.
Among those who organized this movement, there was a large
number of _Congressmen_.

Peasants' agitations were getting strong in certain
provinces like the United Provinces from as early as 1922,
in which prominent Congress leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru
had played important roles. From 1939 peasant agitations
had spread to many more provinces as part of the _civil disobedience
movement_. The ordinary Congress workers who
had imbibed experience of these struggles continued to work
in the peasant movement even after the withdrawal of the _civil
disobedience_. A section of them turned _Congress Socialists_
and others remained as _Congressmen_ but worked in cooperation
with Communists and Socialists. As a result, peasant
movements became strong in UP, Bihar, Bengal, Andhra
and other provinces in which the _zamindari_ system was
prevalent and in regions like Malabar in which the _Jenmi_
system was in vogue.

While these developments were taking place in the peasant
front, a conference of the re-united _AITUC_ was held.
In the midst of this conference, an agreement was reached
between the _AITUC_ and the _Congress Socialist Party_, according
to which the letter would strive to make the Congress
accept the demands of workers. Further, the _AITUC_ conference
decided to organize peasant unions and to render assistance
to workers in the _Princely States_.

Thus, a base was laid in 1934--35 for the different
politically oriented groups to work together for a common
cause. The Communists, Socialists and other leftists in the
Congress not only opposed the anti-struggle policy of the
right-wing leadership of the Congress on its own platform,
they also identified themselves fully with workers, peasants
and the people of the _Princely States_ in their struggles in
such a way as to give substance to this opposition.

There were, of course, differences on many fundamental
issues among the different political groups striving to build
an _anti-imperialist_ front, which were, in fact, reflected in
their practical activities. But on many other issues there
was unity among them. On all such issues they stood united
against the right-wing leadership of the Congress. For instance,
the Congress leadership claimed that it was the only
organization which represented the _anti-imperialist_ movement
in the country, and as such, argued that the workers and
peasants must join the Congress to strengthen it. They
strongly contended that even if trade unions and peasant
unions were to be formed to take care of their economic
problems, these organization should be subservient to the
Congress. Communists, Socialists and other leftists did not
agree to this.

The leftists, on the other hand, held the view that if the
workers and peasants were to be able to defend their
interests, they should form their own class organizations
independent of the Congress in which capitalists and landlords
could gain ascendancy. They were led by the perspective
of fostering class organizations independent of the Congress
and independently building an _anti-imperialist_ front by
coordinating their activities. They realized that if this had
to be successfully carried out, a party based on Socialism or
Communism had to be founded and strengthened. But the
Congress was hostile towards to the ideologies of Socialism
and Communism. The position taken by Gandhi that he
would leave the Congress if the Socialists gained ascendancy
in it was not his own, but it was the position of all the disciples
of Gandhi and of the Congress leadership including
those who were upholding parliamentary programme.
Therefore, they naturally felt anxious at the trade union
movement passing into the hands of the leftists and at the
growth of a left-oriented peasant movement. They looked
upon the _anti-imperialist_ unity of these different mass organizations
and the left political groups as the unity of the
political forces which, in the final analysis, were against the
right-wing leadership of the Congress.

This evaluation was correct, because the efforts being
made by the leftist to build an _anti-imperialist_ united front
was a challenge to the policies of the Congress which
decided to drop the programme of _anti-imperialist_ demonstrations
from the _Independence Day_ observance in 1935 and to simply abstain from the Silver Jubilee
celebrations of the rein of the British Emperor without
wounding "the susceptibilities of Englishmen and others
who will want to take part in the celebrations".

## PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT IN _Princely StateS_

As we have referred to earlier, one of the problems that
led to the confrontation between the right-wing Congress
leadership and the leftists inside and outside the Congress
relates to the establishment of democracy in the _Princely
States_. This problem came to be hotly debated in the _AICC_
meetings. The _Working Committee_ which met towards the
end of July 1935 issued a statement on this problem which
was raised in the _AICC_ meeting held earlier in April.

The statement began with a declaration that the Congress
recognized the inherent right of the people in the _Princely
States_ to _Swaraj_ no less than the people in British India.
It pointed out that the Congress was in favour of establishment
of _responsible government_ in the states and had appealed
to the princes to establish such governments in their states
and to guarantee fundamental rights of citizens, like freedom
of speech and press. The statement also declared sympathy and
support in their legitimate and peaceful struggle for the
attainment of full _responsible government_ and that it stood
by that declaration.

However, the statement continued:

>It should be understood however that the responsibility
and burden of carrying on that struggle within the states
must necessarily fall on the States people themselves. The
Congress can exercise moral and friendly influence upon
the States and this it is bound to do wherever possible.
The Congress has no other power under existing circumstances
although the people of India whether under the
British, the princes or any other power are geographically
and historically one and indivisible.

Indisputably, whether it is in the _Princely States_ or in
the _British Provinces_, the responsibility and burden of carrying
on the struggle for democracy rest with the people of
the respective states or provinces. In the case of _British
Provinces_, no one considers the leadership and assistance given
by the Congress to the people in their struggles as "interference
in the internal affairs of the provinces". The left parties
pointed out that the struggle being conducted by the people
of the _Princely States_ which the Congress described as "geographically
and historically one and indivisible" was the
_anti-imperialist_ struggle of the entire people of India.

In fact, democratic movements in the _Princely States_
were growing without "interference" form the Congress.
Though the Congress had excluded the _Princely States_ from
the _Salt Satyagraha_ of 1930 and the _civil disobedience_ of 1932, the waves of _anti-imperialist_ movement were rising
there also. In states like Kashmir and Alwar, for example, struggles
against the autocratic rule had started emerging. A new
generation of political workers who had been thrown up in
these movement had started entering in Indian politics co-operating
with Congress, but expressing disagreement on the
policies pursued by the Congress with regard to the _Princely
States_. The Communists, _Congress Socialists_ and other leftists
not only expressed their sympathy for these people but
also the willingness to render them all help and co-operation.

Before going into the details of this new upsurge, it is
necessary to describe briefly the general political situation
that led to it. The scheme of _All-India Federation_ consisting
of the British Indian provinces and _Princely States_,
which was devised by the British to oppose the national demand
of _full independence_ was accepted by the Princes, and
they expressed their readiness to join the federation.

Realizing that this was a dangerous scheme, the nationalists
in British India demanded _responsible government_
separately for British India. We have referred to earlier a
resolution to this effect adopted by the Central Assembly
with the combined strength of the Congress, the _Nationalist
Party_ and the Jinnah group.

However, the reaction of the people of _Princely States_
was different. They began to demand establishment of democracy
in the _Princely States_ thereby making the entire Federation
democratic, ending the disparity between the _British
Provinces_ and the _Princely States_. Efforts were made in many
states to convene people's conferences to build public opinion
behind this demand.

As a reflection of this development, demands had been
raised by some quarters to introduce amendments to the _constitutional
reforms_ proposal relating to the relation of the
_Princely States_ to the Federation. On this demand, the July
statement of the _Working Committee_ which has been referred
to above pointed out that since the Congress had totally
rejected the reforms proposal, it could not demand amendment
to a part of it. In any case, the statement added that
"the Congress will never be guilty of sacrificing their interests
in order to buy the support of the Princes".

These developments show that, as was the case with the
British India half a century ago, a _bourgeois_ democratic
movement had started developing in the _Princely States_ with
a leadership to lead the movement in a _bourgeois_ way.

The Congress leadership had been ignoring the democratic
issue of the _Princely States_ maintaining that the conflicts
and contradictions between the people and Princes were
the "internal problems" of the states. There was an economic
reason behind it. Despite the slow pace, _Capitalism_ was
developing throughout India. In this phenomena, the _Princely
States_ were comparatively behind the _British Provinces_.
For example, while the number of joint-stock companies in
British India increased from 8,346 to 10,070 in the 1930s, the
increase in the _Princely State_ was from 894 to 1044 during
the same period. The total paid up capital of these companies
in the British India increased from 2685.1 million rupees
to 2754.2 million rupees during the same period, while the
increase in the _Princely States_ was from 125.6 million rupees
to 149.7 million rupees.

The new (_bourgeois_) class was facing innumerable
obstructions from the feudal domination in the _Princely States_
as it was from the British rule at the all-India level. For
the developing _bourgeoisie_ in these states, a fight against the
feudal forces was inevitable. They knew that the federal
system that the British rulers were planning to impose would
only further strengthen the feudal rule in the states and that
they had to merge themselves in the struggle that was going
on in British India against this system.

But, now in the _Princely States_, the development of the
democratic movement under the leadership of the _bourgeoisie_
had stirred the worker and peasant masses and brought
them to the arena of struggle as it had happened earlier
in British India. In many places "acts of violence" took
place as it often happens when the masses go into action and
make the _bourgeois_ leadership feel disturbed.

Besides, due to the peculiarity of the situations existing
in many states, the contradiction between the majority and
minority communities cast its shadow on the democratic
movement, enabling the opponents of the struggle to characterize
it as a reflection of the rivalries between the different
communities.

Despite the complexity in form, these struggles helped
to give a form to the _anti-feudal_ and _anti-imperialist_ feelings
of the people in the _Princely States_.

In this context, the state of Jammu and Kashmir
deserves special mention. As compared to the _British Provinces_
as well as the states of Mysore and Travancore,
Jammu and Kashmir was capitalistically less advanced.
The feudal exploitation and landlordism were particularly
notorious there. Besides, the Kashmir region of the state
was a Muslim majority area, whereas in the Jammu region
Hindus constituted a majority. The ruler of the state was
a Hindu. Therefore, the _anti-feudal_ struggle of the
Kashmiris was characterized by the enemies of the democratic
movement as a muslim rebellion against the Hindus.

The case with Alwar in Rajasthan was more or less the
same. There the king and a large number of big landlords
as well as a majority of the people in South Alwar were
Hindus, while the people of northern Alwar were mostly
Muslims. Here too, the _anti-feudal_ struggle of the people
was characterized by its enemies as an anti-Hindu rebellion of
the Muslims.

Despite the communal colour, the mass movement that
developed in Kashmir and Alwar reached a new height. The
people of these two states not only demanded establishment
of democracy in place of the autocratic rule, but they also
took the struggle against big landlords to the form of armed
struggle in some places. The people fighting with arms clashed
with the armed forces of the rulers. The British army
was deployed to these states to quell the "rebellion". The
slogan of democracy raised by the _bourgeois_ national movement
went deep into the worker and peasant masses and
transformed itself into a wide-spread mass movement.

The _Kashmir National Conference_ which grew under
the leadership of its foremost leader Sheik Abdulla had
been influenced by the social background of that state. It
was the later form of two separate organizations called the
_Akhtar Party_ and the _Muslim National Conference_ which did
contain elements of the contradiction between the Hindu
king and the Muslim masses.

But, objectively, it was as well a movement for the
liberation of the Hindus in the Jammu region from the
autocratic rule.

Right in the early 1930s one could see the early image
Sheik Abdulla who became a historic personality by integrating
Kashmir with India opposing the 'Two Nations Theory'
of Jinnah and the partition of India based on that theory.

This was by no means a peculiarity of Kashmir ; movements
for establishing democracy in many other _Princely
States_ possessed a similar communal colour. For example,
the erstwhile states of Travancore and Cochin of the present-day
Kerala were theoretically theocratic states where only
_Caste Hindus_ had any role in the armed forces and in civil
administration with an upper hand for _Brahmins_. Consequently,
for a majority of the population in these states, the
terms '_responsible government_' and 'democracy' meant liberation
of _non-Caste Hindus_ and non-Hindus from the theocratic
high caste rule. In Travancore, the agitation against high
caste domination had reached a high stage by 1934--35 during
which many important events took place such as the historic
'_Kozhanchery speech_' of C Kesavan and his consequent imprisonment.
It was only in 1937--38, that the _Samyukta Prasthanam_,
a joint movement of various communities, transformed
itself into the Travancore State Congress.

Though we have referred to only the movements in
Kashmir, Alwar and Travancore in some details, democratic
movements with and without communal colour were spreading
in many other _Princely States_. However, these movements
were not as powerful and wide-spread as they were in
the British Indian provinces. The main reason for this was
the policy being pursued by the right-wing Congress leadership.
The same leadership which made every effort to rally
the people in the _British Provinces_ behind the _anti-imperialist_
struggle, completely neglected the democratic movements in
the _Princely States_. The leadership only expressed sympathy
with the movements in the states leaving them to be settled
between the people and their rulers.

The _anti-imperialist_ front which the Communists, _Congress
Socialists_ and other leftist groups were striving at
constituted a challenge to the policy of the right-wing leadership
of the Congress. And in this, the left forces were being
supported by the people's movements and the desire of the
_bourgeoisie_ in general to establish democracy in the _Princely
States_.

## NEW CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS: TWO VIEWS

On 2nd August 1935 the British Parliament passed the
_Government of India Bill, 1935_, for _constitutional reforms_,
which remained, with certain changes, in force until India became
a republic on 26th January 1950.

It was a reforms measure which was more advanced
than all the previous reforms introduced by Britain. It
contained, for the first time, a step to bring the administration
of the provinces under the control of the elected representatives
of the people.

According to the earlier reforms (of 1919), a part of
the provincial government was under the control of the
ministers responsible to the elected representatives, while
the rest was under the control of government officials. The
new reforms act ended this and brought the entire provincial
administration under the control of elected ministers. Official
members almost ceased to exist in the legislatures. The
system of nomination by the Government of members to
represent the Depressed Castes and other special interests
also ended. Above all, the right to vote was more liberalized.

Along with this, certain other important problems which
led to people's agitation for some time were also solved.
Burma which was till then a province of India was separated
from India. Orissa which was part of Bihar and Sind a part
of Bombay were made separate provinces.

The system of communal representation proposed by
the British government amended to include the provisions of
the _Poona Pact_ was introduced. So also the system of separate
electoral constituencies to the satisfaction of the elites
of many communities including the Muslims. It became
clear that a system more or less satisfactory to the non-Hindu
communities was coming into being regardless of the
opposition from the _Nationalist Party_ and other Hindu
organizations.

To the _bourgeoisie_, this was an important step forward.
However, the new constitutional act also contained certain
provisions which were disappointing to this class which was
steadily growing in strength.

_First_, there were "special powers" vested in the
Governor restricting the control of the elected members in
the provincial administration. Governors had been vested
with powers authorizing them to work against the administrative
actions taken by ministers and against the bills passed
by the legislature on this or that pretext.

Besides, the administration at the Centre was not at all
flexible. The Dyarchy[^dyarchy] which was introduced in the provinces
earlier was absent in the Centre. It was provided that
for any such change in that direction in the Centre, at least
one-half of the number of rulers of the _Princely States_ must
be ready to join the Federation comprising the British Indian
provinces. In other words, with regard to Central Government,
the existing system (as laid down in the 1919 reform)
would continue.

[^dyarchy]: Government in which power is vested in two rulers or authorities (both Governor who is British agent & Elected representatives).

The problem came up before the _bourgeois_-landlord
classes as to what attitude should be taken on the new reforms
Act. Two mutually incompatible opinions emerged and
found reflected in the Congress. Before entering into the
details of this, however, it is necessary to look into certain
changes that had come about in the _bourgeois_-landlord
classes.

Although the economic crisis which lasted for about three
years from 1929 had pauperized the Indian people including
small and medium businessmen and industrialists, capitalist
development went on during this period. During the years 1934--1939, the number of factories with 20 and more workers
increased from 8,658 to 10,466. The number of workers
also increased from 14,87,000 to 17,51,000. Besides, the cotton
textile industry which had already gained considerable
growth, many more industries appeared in the areas of
sugar, cement and so on. The production of steel increased
from 4,83,000 tons to 7,82,000 tons and its import fell
from 3,28,000 to 2,80,000 tons. The _bourgeoisie_ was able to
surge ahead overcoming the obstruction placed by the
government before it. Two characteristic features of this
surge of _Capitalism_ in India need special mention.

_First_, within the capitalist circle itself, a narrow section
of monopolists had started appearing in its primary form
in this period. These monopoly concerns were the _Indian
Sugar Syndicate_ and the _Associated Cement Company_ which
were established to protect the interests of the capitalists
invested in the sugar and cement industries.

_Second_, those who had begun to grow as monopoly
capitalists had started to get integrated with foreign capitalists,
and with the feudal elements like Indian princes, big
landlords and moneylenders.

For example, in the _Associated Cement Company_,
British finance capitalists and Indian princes were shareholders.
Killick Industries, a British monopoly enterprise,
had on its director board the Indian capitalist giant Tata and
about eight others representing Indian princes. This is
important as the primary form of the alliance of the
ruling classes in the post-independent India.

On the other hand, the nature of capitalist development
in India and the policies being pursued by the government
were detrimental to the interests of the Indian _bourgeoisie_,
including the big capitalists. The "agreement" reached between
the direct representatives of the British government
and the British officers who were ruling here in the name of
"Government of India" had been crushing the entire cotton
textile industry in India. On the top of it, the capitalists in
this industry had to face the stiff competition from the
Japanese textiles.

The condition of small scale industries was still worse.
The handloom industry had to face the attacks of both foreign
and Indian mill-owners in order for it to exist. The small
and medium capitalists who had invested in this industry as
well as hundreds of thousands of workers employed in it
were getting pauperized.

In order to escape from the crisis, a section of medium
handloom factory owners was introducing modern machinery
and modern methods of production. But they had to
face competition from the rapidly developing Indian monopolists
and foreign capitalists. They were also being harassed
by the government policy favouring the monopolies.

The change which had come about in the class relations
had its impact on _bourgeois_ politics. Two mutually incompatible
views emerged on the way to get richer and to win
controlling power in the administration utilizing the provisions
of the _Reforms Act_. Similarly, the contradiction between
the right-wing leadership of the Congress and leftists
inside and outside the Congress also got sharpened.

The right-wing leadership looked upon the provision in
the _Reforms Act_ with regard to provincial administration as
the rights they had obtained as a result of their continuous
struggles and agitations. They were not blind to the limitations
of the Act, such as the special powers vested in the
Governor. With regard to the Central administration, not
only the Congress leadership but also the _Congress Nationalist
Party_, the Jinnah group as well as the 'moderates' who
had been esteemed in the official circle despite the defeat in
the election, complained that the scheme was unacceptable.
These sections, however, regarded that utilizing the rights
granted at the provincial level, they would be able to get their
demands accepted with regard to the administration at the
Centre.

They thought that by fighting elections under the new
system and forming ministries wherever they got a majority
in the legislatures, they would be able to get the special
powers vested in the Governors and British officials reduced
and also to rally more and more people behind them. They
expected that the Congress which would be strengthened by
utilizing control in the provincial administration would be
able to fight more effectively to win the demands with regard
to the administration at the Centre.

This was not agreeable to the leftists who argued that
this policy would lead to gradual surrender to the British or
to compromise with them. They feared that the Congress
leaders who had hitherto been conducting struggles would
turn against struggles and convert the Congress into an anti-struggle
organization if they were to accept power even if it
was at the provincial level. So, the question whether the
Congress should enter the ministries or not after elections
came to be keenly debated in the Congress.

Two slogans raised in accordance with the leftist approach
towards the new constitution need to be mentioned here.
These slogans were "_Wreck the Constitution_" and "_The
British has no right to frame a constitution for India, it is the
right of Indian people._" The content of both the slogans is the
same. The strategy of the struggle evolved by the right-wing
Congress leadership and the 'moderates' outside the Congress
was to secure a share in power by bargaining with the British
government. An essential means for this was to exert pressure
by organizing mass struggles.

On the contrary, the approach of the leftists was to
establish an independent State by the Indian people themselves
by conducting an uncompromising struggle and capturing
power through revolutionary means, rather than winning the
national demand with the approval of the British. It was as
a practical form of this outlook that the leftists raised the
slogan for a _constituent assembly_.

The right-wing leadership of the Congress and the
'moderates' outside the Congress were opposed to this revolutionary
perspective. But the right-wing Congress leadership
adopted many of the suggestions and slogans of the leftists.
They had no doubt that the "constitution should be wrecked".
They had no dispute over the point that it was the Indian
people and not the British who should frame India's future
constitution. They had no hesitation to take up as their own
the slogan of _constituent assembly_ in accordance with
these ideas. And this was what distinguished the right-wing
Congress leadership from the 'moderates' outside the Congress.

But, as the events in the next decade had shown, these
slogans which the right leadership borrowed from the leftists
were utilized to gain further mass support in order to bargain
with the British. The general strategy of struggle acceptable
to the _bourgeoisie_ consists of the following: Rally the people
behind themselves with the aid of attractive leftist slogans
and bargain with the British authorities utilizing the organized
strength of the masses; when the British becomes
obstinate in the process of the bargain, release the organized
popular force against them; compromise with them when
the British become compelled to change their position.

A condition indispensable for the success of this strategy
is that the right-wing Congress leadership must adopt a style
of work capable of giving satisfaction and inspiration to the
left at least to a limited extent. Just as the resolution of "_Full
Independence_" was adopted in 1929 as part of unleashing
the people against the British, so now, the Congress had to
raise the _anti-imperialist_ leftist slogan of "_constituent assembly_"
and install the leftist Jawaharlal Nehru as the president
of the organization as was done earlier. At the same time,
the organization should be safely in the hands of people
like Sardar Patel, the savior of the capitalist interests and the
steel man of the organization. This would facilitate the
Congress to interpret the slogan of "_constituent assembly_"
in any manner and enter into bargain with the British as in
the case of the "_Purna Swaraj_" resolution earlier.

## INTERNATIONAL SITUATION

In the preceding chapter we have described at length
he division of the main political forces in India in two camps
with the leftists inside and outside the Congress including
the Communists and _Congress Socialists_ on the one side, and
right-wing Congress leadership and the 'moderates' outside
the Congress, on the other. The slogan of "_anti-imperialist_
front" raised in the Lucknow session of the Congress in April 1936 was a manifestation of this division in the national
movement. The presidential speech delivered by Jawaharlal
Nehru was, in fact, a call for an _anti-imperialist_ front.

These developments that took place in India had an
international background. Calls had started coming at the
international level for the unity of party-men and non-party
democrats and freedom lovers throughout the world against
the danger raised by fascism and against imperialist domination.
Actions in response to this call were going on in
different countries in different forms. Efforts were also being
made for the formation of a joint front against imperialism
and fascism by coordinating such activities in the different
countries.

We have referred earlier to the economic crisis that
engulfed the capitalist world beginning with 1929. Mention
was also made of the progress being achieved by the Soviet
Union without being affected by the economic crisis. We also
know that these parallel developments had helped the growth
of left-wing politics in India.

However, this was not a mere economic crisis. It had
transformed itself into a general crisis affecting political,
ideological and other sectors and got intensified creating
repercussions and movements in different forms in different
countries.

In the beginning, only the working class was interested
in the movement for the fight for Socialism. But its first
victory --- the October Socialist Revolution in Russia --- inspired
not only the working class all over the world, but also the
peoples groaning under the yoke of imperialism. In _October
Revolution_ they discerned the future of those fighting for
national independence.

Mao Zedong once said that the Chinese people received
the message of Communism through the salvos of the _October
Revolution_. This was also true of people of the backward,
colonial and semi-colonial countries, called the '_Third World_'.
The _Communist International_ led by Lenin strove to sow the
seed of the Communist movement in the predominantly
agrarian countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. We
have seen in the previous chapters how this affected India,
The same happened in many other countries like China,
Indo-China and Indonesia in Asia and Mexico and other countries
in America. These efforts were far more successful in
certain countries like China and Indo-China.

It became widely known that the progress of the Soviet
Union and the political liberation of colonial and semi-colonial
countries were interlinked. The slogan of "_Workers of
the word, Unite_" raised by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels
became a broader concept. Along with it a new slogan also
came to be raised: "_Workers and oppressed peoples of the
world, unite_".

As a result of the world economic crisis that began in 1929, a new section, in addition to workers and the peoples
exploited by imperialism, of the ruling classes in the capitalist
countries also became interested in the progress of the Soviet
Union, because they felt disturbed at the emergence of fascist
dictatorship which was a creation of leaders of _World Capitalism_
as an instrument of war, a device they found to get out
of the economic crisis. Fascism was instrumental for the
suppression of a section of the ruling classes and for bringing
to power a more reactionary section among them. Since it
was by destroying all the democratic values which the _bourgeoisie_
had upheld in the early stage of the development of
_Capitalism_ that the fascism was advancing menacingly and
preparing for a war, the _bourgeois_ _intelligentsia_ and politicians
were opposed to the butchery of "democracy" by fascism.

In this background, all sections realized that all those
who believed in _bourgeois democracy_ and those working
with working class outlook must work together to prevent
the growth of fascism and avoid a war. It was also realized
that Communists and Socialists fighting each other must
join hands together and with other peace loving and _anti-fascist_
sections of the _bourgeois_ politicians. In accordance
with it, _anti-fascist_ fronts emerged secretly in the fascist regimes
of Italy and Germany and openly in countries like France
where fascist organizations were growing.

In order to assimilate the experience of these activities
and to find ways to march forward more effectively, a _World
Congress_ of the _Communist International_ was held in August 1935. In the report presented to the Seventh Congress of
the International, Georgi Dimitrov attributed the growth of
fascism to the weakness of the working class as well as the
weakness of _Capitalism_ arising out of the economic crisis
The resolution based on the report of Dimitrov adopted by
the Seventh Congress of the International stated:

>The growth of fascism and its victory attest not only to the
weakness of the working class, disorganized as the result
of Social Democracy's disruptive policy of class collaboration
with the _bourgeoisie_, but also due to the _weakness of
the bourgeoisie itself_ which is stricken with fear at the realisation
of unity in the struggle of the working class, is in fear
of revolution, and is no longer able to maintain dictatorship
by the old methods of _bourgeois democracy_.

In the light of this explanation, Dimitrov suggested and
the International approved a new tactics of uniting and
rallying under the leadership of the working class all the
_anti-fascist_ forces. This common tactics had to be implemented
taking into consideration of the concrete conditions
existing in each country. The resolution of the International
also pointed out that the task of the people in the backward
colonial and semi-colonial countries was to form "_anti-imperialist_
people's fronts". The resolution stated:

>In the _colonial and semi-colonial countries_, the most important
task facing the Communists consists in working to
establish an _anti-imperialist people's front_. For this purpose
it is necessary to draw the widest masses into the national
liberation movement against growing imperialist, exploitation,
against cruel enslavement, for the driving out of the
imperialists, for independence of the country.

The essence of the analysis of the International was that the
imperialist countries as well as the ruling classes in the capitalist
countries had been split into two camps,fascist and non-fascist.
Accordingly, the International formulated the tactics
of utilizing the contradictions between the imperialist countries
and a section of the ruling classes in the capitalist countries
by building a broad united front of all _anti-imperialist_ forces
and, at the same time, building unity of the working class
engaged in a consistent and unwavering fight against _monopoly
Capitalism_ which gives rise to fascism and consolidating
its own organizations.

These tactics were born out of the experience of practical
activities being carried out in a number of countries in the
world. In his report Dimitrov evaluated the experience
of those who stood in the forefront of organizing the _anti-fascist_
struggle in many countries including Germany. In
France where this tactic was put into practice, within a few
months a united front, called the "_Popular Front_" came into
being, comprising Communists, Socialists, the trade union
movement and many other mass movements. The front
was even able to win election and form an _anti-fascist_ government
in France. Similar _anti-fascist_ people's fronts were
formed in many other countries in Europe.

The impact of this new _anti-fascist_ _anti-imperialist_ movement
helped _anti-imperialists_ and democrats all over the
world to establish contact and render assistance to each other.
The Japanese aggression against China, that of Italy against
Abyssinia, and the rebellion organized by Gen. Franco
against the elected government in Spain made people all over
the world indignant. Voices of protest rose high against these
attacks and against the man-hunt that was going on in the
fascist countries. These voices reverberated in India also.

We have referred earlier to the reactions of Indian
nationalists to the international development at the different
stages of Indian _freedom struggle_. We have mentioned
specifically that in the 1920s the Congress had formally
joined the _League against Imperialism_ and had sent delegates
to its world conference. The same happened now in a higher
form. The happenings in China, Abyssinia and Spain roused
intense feelings among the ranks of the Indian freedom
movement. Like the Communists and Socialists, the _Congressmen_
began the practice of expressing fraternity to the revolutionaries
of those countries and greeting them. In other
words, an awareness spread in the Indian freedom movement
that the struggle for independence in India was not an
isolated one, but that it was, rather, an integral part of the
organized struggles being carried out by the peoples of
different countries for national independence, democracy and
Socialism. As in the case of many other issues, this also was
a subject of acute controversy between the right-wing leadership
and the left-wing in the Congress.

For the left-wing, our international relation was symbolic
of the relation between the Indian people fighting an uncompromising
battle and advancing to a successful national
revolution, and similar mass movements of other countries
moving along a revolutionary path. The left-wing
regarded that the achievements of the Soviet Union, the
_anti-fascist_ united fronts of the working class and other
revolutionary forces in the capitalist countries, the underground
activities of the working class and other left forces
challenging the fascist terror in Germany and Italy, the
victorious advance of the Red Army in China and the growth
of the revolutionary movements in other countries in Asia
were enriching and strengthening the _anti-imperialist_ struggle
of the Indian people. Briefly, they regarded that their
relationship with these elements of world revolutionary
movement was part of their revolutionary perspective of
India's future.

This was distinct from the position of the right-wing
leadership. They were not enthusiastic to the achievements of
the Soviet Union. Nor did they feel attached to the revolutionary
movements in China and other countries. They were,
in fact, hostile to Communist ideology and the political outlook
associated with it. The general political line of the right-wing
leadership was a reflection of the desire of _bourgeois_-landlord
classes to utilize the pressure of popular struggles
to bargain and win their own political demands.

But, as long as the British rulers were not prepared to
concede their demands, the right-wing leadership could not
but fight against the rulers. In order to create a favourable
situations in these struggles, they had to pretend that they
were with the revolutionary struggles across the world. Thus
the right-wing leadership took over the international slogans
raised by the leftists with utmost honesty. Consequently,
the Congress began to acquire the position as one of the
elements of the world-wide _anti-fascist_ front. It appeared
as though the Congress had an intimate relation with the
world movement against imperialism.
