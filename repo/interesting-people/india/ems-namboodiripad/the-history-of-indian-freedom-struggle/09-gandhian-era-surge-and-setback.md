# GANDHIAN ERA: SURGE AND SETBACK

## TILAK AND GANDHI

The last Congress session which Tilak attended was the
one held at Amritsar. Hardly three months after this
session, this stalwart who dominated the Indian political
scene for nearly three decades breathed his last. Even before
the Amritsar session, Tilak had become aware that he was
being pushed to the back row. He also knew of the person who
was forging ahead, pushing him back. Durga Das, then a
young journalist, had an informal talk with Tilak at the
Amritsar Congress, which he has recorded thus:

>I may not live to see it (_Home Rule_), but the next generation
will if we work hard and apply our mind to the new
task. I recognise, however, that the Punjab disturbances,
the martial law regime and the _Jallianwala massacre_, which
have made men like Sir Sankaran Nair and poet Tagore
throws up their jobs and honours, have charged the political
atmosphere with a spirit of revolt, of which Gandhi is the
new symbol. I will not stand in his way, even though I
feel that _responsive cooperation_ will yield the maximum
benefit.[^09/1]

[^09/1]: Durga Das, _India: From Curzon to Nehru and After_, London, Collins. 1969, pp. 69--70.

The talks between Gandhi and Tilak at Amritsar were
historic. As we have seen in the previous chapter, many
have considered it an irony that Tilak who, entering the
political arena as the spokesman of _anti-British_ resistance
and _Boycott_, gradually eclipsed the 'moderate' leaders, should
turn himself into a spokesman for cooperation, though
"conditional", with the British.

An equally surprising irony was that Gandhi also underwent
a similar transformation. Gandhi who was active in
South Africa in the recruitment to the British Army in the
Boer War and later in the First World War, in a meeting
called by the authorities in 1918, disagreed with the offer
made by Tilak to assist the British on conditions in their war.
The same Gandhi who then suggested to Tilak that the
assistance should be unconditional, had now transformed
himself into the spokesman of unconditional _non-cooperation_.

Equally significant, as were the changes that came about
in the political positions of Tilak and Gandhi, was the contrast
in their character, capabilities and their general world outlook.
It was due to pressure of circumstances that Tilak, a
distinguished scholar in science, literature and other branches
of knowledge, became an agitator and thereby a victim of
intense wrath of the authorities. As for Gandhi, he had not
only taken to English education, the carrier to the highest
position that the young generation of Indians at that time
could aspire for, but had gone to England to become a barrister.
Only later, when he went to South Africa for employment,
he, too, became an agitator because of pressure of
circumstances. Gandhi, who was the leader of the struggle
of Indians in South Africa, had neither the experience in
Indian politics nor was he, comparatively speaking, well
known. That was the position when he attended the Amritsar
Congress. On the other had, Tilak had attained great fame
through continuous political agitations under his leadership
and the consequent sufferings which was evident from the
epithets '_Lokmanya_' and 'Tilak Maharaj' that the people
conferred on him.

Politically, Gandhi was a 'moderate' while in South Africa
and even after his return to India; he was a faithful disciple
of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Tilak's adversary in politics.
Gandhi had mentioned several times, while Gokhale was
alive and even after his demise, of the teacher-disciple relationship
between Gokhale and himself. It was this Gandhi,
who had been active in Indian politics only for about five
years as the faithful disciple of this will-known 'moderate',
who now faced Tilak. But during his last days, Tilak had
the sagacity to realize that he himself was being eclipsed by
the rise of the disciple of his political adversary, Gokhale,
whom he had earlier overtaken. And that was what he
pointed out in his informal talk with Durga Das.

It is indisputable that the months immediately before and
after the Amritsar Congress were crucial for Indian politics.
It marked the end of a historic period which we have termed
the "Tilak Era", and the emergence of a new one named after
Gandhi. Basic changes were taking place in the objectives
of the _freedom struggle_ as well as in the individuals and
groups participating in it, in the method of the struggle and
organizational forms. The entry of Tilak and his colleagues
and the subsequent waves of mass upsurge that swept over
the country had imparted a specific characteristic to the first
two decades of the 20th century. Similarly, the entry of
Gandhi and the subsequent events in the post-war years imparted
their own specific characteristics to that period.

However, different Gandhi and Tilak were in their
individual character, abilities, and general world outlook,
both had one particular characteristic in common. Both were
equally adept in assimilating the essence of the times they
lived in and of the thoughts and emotions of the people they
came in contact with, in declaring the aims and chalking out
the path and in building up the organization on that basis
covering them into an art and science.

Millions recognized as their own the emotions expressed
by Tilak while he was alive, and by Gandhi after he entered
the arena. Both lived and worked in a manner which instilled
such an awareness among the people. It was this
popular sentiment that made Tilak '_Lokmanya_' and 'Tilak
Maharaj' and Gandhi the '_Mahatma_' and the 'Father of the
Nation'.

Tilak and Gandhi had complete identity not only in
their ability to rally the millions behind them but also in the
class interests that they protected. Both worked, succeeded
and failed in protecting the same (_bourgeois_) class interests.
Tilak aroused the hopes and enthusiasm of the millions to
accelerate the growth of the _bourgeoisie_ by raising the slogans
of "_Swaraj_", "_Swadeshi_", "_Home Rule_", etc., as the
objectives and by adopting the agitational programmes of
_non-cooperation_ and _conditional cooperation_. Gandhi, on the
other hand, gave a firmer basis to the achievements registered
under Tilak and created a mass upsurge necessary for the
further growth of the _bourgeoisie_ in the conditions characteristic
of his time.

Tilak entered Indian politics at a time when the general
outlook of national independence and _bourgeois democracy_
had diffused among the educated middle class. Giving a
concrete form to the urge of this section of the people for
independence and their democratic consciousness, Tilak
evolved slogans and forms of struggle, such as "_Swadeshi_"
"_Swaraj_", _Boycott_, resistance, use of mother tongue in place
of English, and so on. This was Tilak's individual contribution
to Indian politics. And he brought up a new generation
which adopted these aims and forms of struggle.

Tilak's political activities resulted in strengthening the
_anti-British_ _freedom struggle_ of the people and in the creation
of an army of fighters in this struggle, on the one side and,
on the other side, in the creation of the capability of the
_bourgeoisie_ to strengthen economically and politically and to
bargain with the British rulers more effectively. It is
true that the organizational consciousness among workers,
peasants and other sections of the masses also grew along
the development of the struggle for independence. Their
agitations and struggles were taking place here and there.
In many of these, worker-capitalist contradictions were evident.
In such instances, national leaders like Tilak did not
hesitate to stand by the workers, peasants and other toiling
masses, which made them mass leaders.

In those days, these mass agitations were not so strong
as to be evidently dangerous to the class interests of the capitalists
and landlords. On the contrary, Tilak and his
colleagues had adopted slogans and forms of struggle which
helped to rally workers and peasants along with the educated
middle classes behind _Swadeshi_ and _Swaraj_ which were beneficial
to these vested interests as well.

By Gandhi's time, conditions had begun to change. The
experience that the Indian people had gained just before and
during the war and the numerous revolutionary struggles that
had taken place outside India in the post-war years had
aroused a new political awareness and enthusiasm for action
among India's millions. The experience of fighting in the
battlefield abroad had basically changed the outlook of tens
of thousands of Indians. Symptoms of a new revolutionary
thrust were discernible all over India, as a continuation of
the struggle for _Swaraj_ and _Home Rule_ led by Tilak and
others and as an inseparable part of the simultaneous revolutionary
upsurge that was going on all over the World.

An important development which deserves special mention
here is the wave of strikes that spread among industrial
workers during 1918--19. True, workers had gone on strike
on many occasions in several parts of India. But such a
strike-wave that equally affected all the important industrial
centres was unprecedented. Moreover, unlike on previous
occasions when things were let off with the end of a strike,
now attempts were made to form a permanent organization
of the workers. In other words, workers at the local level had
already begun leading to the formation of an all-India trade
union organization in another couple of years.

The strike in early 1918 in Ahmedabad against the cut
in bonus lasted for a month. It ended with a partial victory for
the workers in that it compelled the management at least to
reduce the rate of the cut. Not long after the Ahmedabad
strike came the strike in the _Buckingham and Carnatic Mills_
in Madras. It was in protest against the racial discrimination
practised by the officers of the Mills owned by the
British and for other demands. The workers of Bombay
cotton textile mills and of the jute mills of Bengal struck
work towards the end of 1918 and early 1919. Both these
strikes ended by securing a wage increase by 10 percent.

Gandhi had played a role in the Ahmedabad strike. The
fast he undertook to express sympathy with the demands and
struggles of the workers, and the leadership he gave to the
union formed subsequently became a model to what became
famous later as the 'Gandhian labour organization'.

In about same period, a labour union was organized in
Madras under the leadership of Wadia and Chakkarai Chettiar,
which became a model for non-Gandhian trade union
movement. Thus, it was during the period when an organized
trade union movement was evolving, though with two
different perspectives and adopting two different means of
struggle, and participating in such a movement that Gandhi
entered Indian politics.

He took up the issues not only of industrial workers,
but also the important live issues of peasants and organized
agitations and struggles for their solution. The peasants of
Champaran district in Bihar who were cultivating indigo for
British capitalists had a number of grievances. At the request
of his colleagues who were working to get these grievances
redressed, Gandhi went there and gave leadership to a
_Satyagraha_ organized for the purpose. This and the subsequent
struggle launched in the Kheda district of Gujarat against
increased land tax were the first examples of putting into
practice the method of struggle (_satyagraha_) which he
experimented with in South Africa. It may be noted that it
was in between these two peasant struggles that he gave
leadership to the strike in Ahmedabad.

The success, though partial, of these struggles paved
the way to the rise of Gandhi as a leader of all-India repute.
The awareness that Gandhi was pushing him aside and emerging
as the leader of the new militancy of the Indian people
was instilled in Tilak by the receptions that people gave to
the policies adopted by himself and by Gandhi on certain
issues that came up in Indian politics during this period.
We shall return to this later. However, an obvious difference
between Tilak and Gandhi needs to be pointed out here.
Tilak was both a political agitator and a political thinker.
He began with providing definitions to _Swaraj_, _Home Rule_
and other objectives. To achieve these aims, he adopted the
forms of struggle which were suited to that purpose and which
could be learned from the history of other _bourgeois_ democratic
countries.

Gandhi on the other hand, did not have such well-thought-out objectives or from of struggle. He observed
the people around him, the problems they faced and the
means they themselves adopted to solve them, and suggested
solutions and organizational forms based on common sense.
Gandhi used the method of _Satyagraha_ with which he had
experimented in South Africa, in Champaran, Kheda and
Ahmedabad to solve the issues faced by the entire Indian
people.

While emerging as the new leader of the Indian people
and adopting these methods, Gandhi had no objectives other
than those set out by Tilak. But he evolved his programme of
political work on the basis of the life issues the people faced
and imbibing inspiration from them. And that prompted
him to give up the 'moderate' outlook of Gokhale whom, in
the early period, he had adopted as his _political guru_.

It was this that enabled him to push back the radical
movement of Tilak, and rise as the founder leader of a new
all-India movement of mass struggle.

## THE JALLIANWALA BAGH

Side by side with holding discussions on the _Montagu-Chelmsford
Reforms_, the rulers had taken steps to sharpen
the weapons of repression as another aspect of their policy.

A few months after the first announcement on the
reforms in the Parliament, Viceroy Chelmsford appointed a
committee in December 1917 with Justice Rowlatt as chairman
"to investigate and report on the nature and extent of criminal
conspiracies connected with the revolutionary movement
in India and to advise as to the legislation necessary to deal
effectively with them".

The _Revolutionary Conspiracies Enquiry Committee_,
popularly known as the _Rowlatt Committee_ had, in addition
to the chairman, two Englishmen and two Indians as members.
Its proceedings were held in complete secrecy. Apart from the facts and figures presented before it by the Government,
the Committee did not care to examine witnesses,
nor did it try to ascertain public opinion by any other means.
It simply prepared a history of the Indian revolutionary
movement on the basis of the information provided by the
Government and examined the actions the Government had
taken to meet the movement.

The _Rowlatt Committee_ proposed legislations giving
approval to the continuance, in other forms, of the existing
extra-ordinary powers vested with the local officials. On the
basis of the Committee's report, the Indian Government
drafted two bills with the object of simplifying the procedures
for the trial of persons accused of crime and sedition
and drastically cutting the rights of the accused. The bills
contained provisions to harass political workers. They conferred
powers on the Governments to demand security from
any person, impose restrictions on residence, curb freedom
of activities, to search house and arrest persons at any place.
These provisions could be invoked against any person the
government considered appropriate and detain anyone without
trial. Though there were provisions to constitute a
committee to examine the complaints of those subject to
actions on the basis of this law, they had no right to appear
before the committee through a lawyer or even to seek legal
advice in filing an appeal. The authorities claimed that
such draconian measures were essential to give protection
to life and property.

This legislation aroused sharp protests from all sections
of the Indian people. Meetings and demonstrations were
organized all over the country against this '_lawless law_'. All
the non-official Indian members of the Central legislature
unanimously opposed this repressive bill and four of them
tendered their resignation in protest. India had not seen
such a widespread political agitation since the days of the
partition of Bengal.

But the Government did not heed to these protest actions.
The bill which was passed exclusively with official votes on 18th March 1919 came into operation on 21st March 1919.

It was by taking the initiative in starting a _satyagraha_
movement against this that Gandhi entered the political scene
on an all-India scale. First, he wrote a letter to the Viceroy,
as he did in many later struggles, demanding withdrawal of
the law. When the Government refused to concede this
demand and brought the law into force, he drafted a pledge
to be taken by those who were prepared to disobey the law:

>We pledge to refuse civilly to obey this law and other laws
that may be proposed by the committee to be appointed and
participate faithfully in these struggles without causing violence
to persons or properties.

Gandhi called a meeting of the first 24 signatories to the
pledge (Gandhi was one of them). A _Satyagraha Sabha_ was
formed with Gandhi as chairman. To mark the beginning
of the struggle, Gandhi gave a call for a day's countrywide
_hartal_.

The response to this call was amazing. The _hartal_
originally fixed for 30th March was changed to 6th April. But
on the 30th itself meetings and demonstrations were held in
many places. Reckless firing was resorted to in Delhi causing
death to some, and injuries to many. The British nurses in
the police hospital even refused to treat those wounded in
the firing. We won't nurse rioters --- said they. The beating
and shooting by the police at Delhi and Amritsar enraged
the people. Local leaders appealed to Gandhi to visit the
trouble spots. And Gandhi, who started on his journey, was
prohibited by the authorities from entering Delhi and Punjab
and was forced to return to Bombay. The people of Bombay,
hearing the news, took out a huge procession, braving the
attacks of the mounted police and received Gandhi. Later,
Gandhi and his colleagues were arrested while they were
proceeding to Ahmedabad. Enraged by these actions, the
people expressed their protest in many forms.

These incidents took place on 30th March the date initially
proposed by Gandhi for _hartal_. By 6th April there were
more widespread and more militant demonstrations by the people,
and more ruthless actions by the authorities. In Lahore,
Gujranwala, Kasur and many other places in Punjab and there
were open clashes between the militant people and the angry
authorities. This was an unprecedented expression of mass
emotion not witnessed even during the peak days of the
agitation against the partition of Bengal.

An incident that took place soon after 6th April in
Punjab turned the very course of history, which became
notorious as the _Jallianwala Bagh massacre_, the beastly
repression in Amritsar on 13th April.

Punjab was the main centre of the new popular upsurge
under Gandhi's leadership. The Governor Michael O'Dwyer
unleashed a reign of repression to suppress the movement.
Dr. Satpal and Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, two prominent
leaders, were deported. The people protested by observing
_hartal_ and staging huge demonstrations.

It was in the midst of these events that news of Gandhi's
arrest reached Punjab. And the demonstration, peaceful but
militant, naturally became one against the arrest as well.
The police opened fire at the demonstrators. Alleging that
the people infuriated at this indulged in violence, including
the murder of certain Europeans, the Government handed
over Amritsar to the military. Dyer took over the administration
of Amritsar city.

With the assumption of power by Dyer, the repression
became more intense. People were arrested indiscriminately,
All meetings and demonstrations were banned. Despite all
these, Dyer could not cow down the people, and he decided
to "teach them a lesson". Dyer chose as his target of attack
the public meeting scheduled to be held at the Jallianwala
Bagh on 13th April at 4.30 p.m. According to Dyer, 6000
people (others put it at 10,000) attended the meeting. He
cared neither to inform the participants that the meeting
was illegal nor to disperse them. On the contrary, he gave
all facilities to the people to reach the meeting ground and
when it was full, fired at them, causing death and injury
"beyond necessary" as it was later accepted officially. The
first official estimate put the dead at 280 later rising to 500;
unofficially, it was put at over 1,000.

The Jallianwala Bagh is a very small place. There is
only one narrow way to get in and out of there. In case of
_lathi-charge_ or firing, there was no way out other than to
bear it all. Later, during the course of an enquiry, Dyer was
asked why the people were first allowed into such a place
and fired at, and whether they could not have been dispersed
without a firing. His reply was revealing. He said that "the
firing saved his prestige as an enforcer of "law and order"". He
did not hesitate to blurt out that his intention was to terrorize
not only the people of Amritsar but the whole of Punjab.

This was not the policy of General Dyer alone. He had
the full support of both the Indian and the British governments.
A section of non-official Englishmen in England and
India praised Dyer as their "protector". But democrats and
various other sections of people in England protested against
this brutal massacre. To appease them the authorities
appointed an enquiry committee to go into the massacre.
At the same time, they saw to it that the report of the commission
was favourable to Dyer.

Nonetheless, even the European majority of the committee
could not fully accept General Dyer's actions. They
agreed that the firing was ordered without warning the people, and it continued too long. The Indians who were a minority
in the committee pointed out that the opinion expressed by
the majority was inadequate. They said Dyer's action was
inhuman and "_un-British_".

Parallel to this official enquiry, an unofficial enquiry was
conducted by a committee appointed by the Congress during
the same time. Gandhi, Motilal Nehru, CR Das, Fazlul Haq,
and Abbas Tyabji were the committee members (when Motilal
was elected President of the Congress in 1919, M.R. Jayakar
took his place), the Committee took evidence from about a
thousand persons. Details of the brutal events which shocked
human consciousness that took place under the O'DwyerDyer
administration were brought out in its report.

The conclusions of the Committee were as follows. The
provocative actions of Michael O'Dwyer in Punjab infuriated
the people. Had not Gandhi been arrested and Satpal and
Kitchlew deported, the people would not have gone violent.
When the infuriated people took to violence, martial law
was introduced to suppress the people which could in no way
be justified, killing about 1200 people and subjecting the
people to revengeful actions. The massacre was unparalleled
for its ferocity in the history of modern British administration.

Not only the firing in the Jallianwala Bagh, but every
subsequent step taken by the authorities was clear evidence
of the brutality of the regime. In fact, the martial law was
imposed officially only after the event. People were ordered
to crawl while passing through a particular road. Flogging and
whipping people whom the authorities thought guilty became
a common practice. A number of places were marked for
this purpose. All these were in addition to awarding sentence
to 289 persons, including 51 to death and 46 to life imprisonment.

Despite these actions taken to stem mass upsurge, they
brought contrary results. Feelings of protest and revenge
spread wide and deep among the people. It was by giving
expression to these feelings that Gandhi stepped into all-India
politics for the first time, adopting means different from
those of other renowned leaders. He made the _Jallianwala
Bagh massacre_ an issue for his struggle. It was an issue
which had aroused protest from all people, including the
'moderates', members of the Central legislature who were
more loyal to the British than the 'Moderates' and the Indian
members of the Jallianwala Bagh Enquiry (official) Committee.
Gandhi took position in the forefront of a movement
under which the masses were organized on an unprecedented
scale on that issue.

In the beginning itself, Gandhi revealed one characteristic
of his form of struggle. The day after the Jallianwala
Bagh incident --- on 14th April --- in a speech at Ahmedabad,
he strongly condemned the "violence on the part of the people".
He confessed that it was a mistake "of a Himalayan
magnitude" on his part that he called for a struggle trusting
the people who behaved such an irresponsible manner .
On 18th April, he issued a statement suspending the _civil
disobedience_ action under his leadership. He decided to
organize _Satyagraha_ volunteers to ensure that the people
never resorted to such violent actions again.

Thus, it became clear that Gandhi was a leader who
could mobilize people for struggle on such a scale that not a
single political leader, including Tilak, could so far do and,
at the same time, suspend the struggle in the name of "violence
on the part of the people" which no other leader dared
to do. These two aspects of the Gandhian form of struggle
were evident at every subsequent stage of the _freedom struggle_.
It is needless to state whom or which class these two
aspects of the Gandhian form of struggle served.

## THE _KHILAFAT_ MOVEMENT

Along with the protest movement against the repression
before and after the Jallianwala Bagh incident there arose
an equally important political issue, the _Khilafat_.

The _Sultan_ of Turkey, known as the _Caliph_, was in the
camp of Germany in the war. Earlier in the Balkan war
also Britain and Turkey were arrayed in opposite camps. We
have indicated earlier that this had helped _anti-British_ feelings
to grow among the Muslims in India. With the end of
the war the issue became more serious, because Turkey was
among the vanquished powers. The war ended imposing
limitations on the _Caliph_'s powers and on the borders of his
territory. '_Khilafat_' was the movement formed to express
the protest of Indian Muslims against this and in sympathy
of the non-Muslims with their Muslim brethren.

During the war the British Prime Minister and the
President of the USA had issued a number of statements with
due regard to the feelings of Indian Muslims. The British
Prime Minister Lloyd George made a categorical statement
that they had no intention whatsoever to snatch away from
Turkey the immensely rich areas of Asia Minor and Thrace.
President Wilson of USA concurred with this stand. The
rulers of Britain and the USA gave these assurances at a
time when they were not sure of the success of their side in
the war. However, their attitude changed after the war. Whatever
assurances given during the war were freely violated.
Thrace was handed over to Greece. Asia Minor was shared
between Britain and France. Even in the remaining parts of
Turkey, the _Sultan_ (_Caliph_) was reduced to a nominal ruler.
The real ruler was a commission appointed by the imperialist
powers including Britain.

The Indian Muslims raised their protest against this, for
the _Caliph_ was deprived of a part of his country, and powers,
and also for the serious breach of trust on the part of Britain
and the _allied powers_. The _All-India Khilafat Committee_
was the organizational form of the anger of India at the
British policy of denying Indian national demand and of
the protest against the violation of assurance given with
regard to the future of the _Caliph_.

Two individuals who played a leading role in this
movement deserve special mention. They were Maulana
Mohammed Ali and Maulana Shaukat Ali, known as the Ali
Brothers. During the war, they had been acclaimed for
their _anti-British_ politics. The speeches they made and the
journals they published under the editorship of Mohammed
Ali served as sharp weapons against the British rule for
which they were imprisoned in 1915 and released only towards
the end of 1919. The _Khilafat Committee_ demanding justice
to the _Caliph_ was formed while they were in prison. Upon
their release, the Ali Brothers became the unquestioned
leaders of the Committee.

Even before this, Gandhi had included the demand of justice
to the _Caliph_ in his charter of demands. Following the
War Conference in Delhi, Gandhi in a letter to the Viceroy
told him that granting _home rule_ to India and assuaging the
feelings of the Muslim community on the question of the
_Caliph_ constituted the principal condition for the security of
the British Empire.

As for the leaders of the _Khilafat Committee_, they had
to demonstrate that theirs was not merely a Muslim movement,
but one that had the full support of the Indian people.
Therefore, Gandhi was chosen as the president of the _Khilafat Committee_ with a new leadership that included the Ali
Brothers.

These developments took place at the end of 1919, when
the wave of mass upsurge against the _Jallianwala Bagh
massacre_ was sweeping the country and the opinion that there
was no question of cooperating with the _Montagu–Chelmsford
Reforms_ was gaining strength. The annual conference of
the Congress was scheduled to be held at Amritsar to discuss
these issues and take suitable decisions. Consequently, the
_Khilafat_ also came under discussion. Situations were becoming
ripe for launching country-wide agitations on these three
issues.

Soon after the Congress session, an _All-India Khilafat
conference_ also was held in Amritsar. The conference constituted
a delegation that included in any outstanding
leaders belonging to both the Muslim and Hindu communities
to take up the issue with the Viceroy. A memorandum submitted
to the Viceroy which was signed by Gandhi, Swami
Shradhanand, Pandit Motilal Nehru and Pandit Madan
Mohan Malaviya among others. Simultaneously, in England,
another delegation led by Maulana Mohammed Ali met Prime
Minister Lloyd George.

The official response to both the delegations were disappointing.
There were clear indications in the replies given
by the Prime Minister and the Viceroy that the powers of the
_Caliph_ and the frontiers of his territory would be reduced by
a treaty marking the end of the war. (The treaty conditions
incorporating these were published later.)

Following this, Gandhi issued a "manifesto" in which
he categorically stated that there was no way out but to resist
this injustice through _non-violent_ _non-cooperation_. It became
clear that he was going to practise the very means which
he had used in South Africa and in the Champaran and Kheda
districts in India to solve an all-India political issue. And
it was the same means which Gandhi used within another
few months in the agitation against the _Reforms Act_ framed
on the basis of the _Montagu-Chelmsford report_. Thus, a
country wide mass upsurge on an unprecedented scale was
developing in India.

That _Khilafat_ too became an issue for mass upsurge
was of particular significance. For, it was an event which
demonstrated the failure of the scheme evolved by the rulers
to split the people's unity developed in the struggle against
the partition of Bengal. Congress leaders belonging the
Hindu community, including Gandhi, and the Muslim leaders,
including the Ali Brothers, jointly condemned the breach of
trust committed by the British rulers. All of them appealed
to the people that Hindu-Muslim differences should not hinder
the united fight against the rulers to win _Home Rule_ for
India and to restore the _Caliph_'s powers.

True, the Hindu-Muslim unity evident in the _Khilafat_
movement did not last long. Within a few years it got shattered
and communal riots broke out in many parts of the
country. Some leaders who stood united on the _Khilafat_
issue passed themselves as Muslim leaders and some others as
Hindu leaders and began to play politics with a communal
bias. Many issues like cow-slaughter, playing of instrumental
music before mosques, etc., were raked up. Tens of
thousands of people belonging to both the communities
rallied in opposite camps. The efforts for unity made by
Gandhi and his close associates who tried to stop this tendency
failed. The tragic culmination of this tendency was the
assassination of Gandhi a quarter of a century later.

There are some who point to these incidents to severely
criticize Gandhi's politics based on _Khilafat_. They derided
him as a "mere idealist" who was after the mirage of Hindu-Muslim
unity, forgetting the "reality" of the "communal
fanaticism" of the Muslim leaders. There were even those
who argued that the attempt to restore the powers of the
_Caliph_ was reactionary and unacceptable to a movement based
on modern democracy and secularism. (Jinnah who later
became the leader of the Muslim divisive movement was one
of them.) Gandhi and others had built up the _Khilafat_
movement to save the _Caliph_, who was removed from power
declaring Turkey a republic by Kamal Pasha. The revolutionary
changes contained in this were a total negation of the
_Khilafat_ movement, these critics contended.

All these are correct. But that cannot obliterate the
historic importance of the _Khilafat_ movement. However
short the period, however opposed to modern democratic
(republican) principles the slogan be, the fact remains that
millions with no communal bar, were organized and rallied
together with a single political objective. They challenged
the mightiest imperialist power of the time. The important
thing was that _Khilafat_ and Hindu-Muslim unity based
on it helped for the spread of the Indian independence movement,
which was slowly developing following the suppression
of the 1857 struggle.

For historical reasons, the Muslim masses were culturally
backward as compared to the Hindus. Besides, they
thought that they were the successors of those who ruled
Delhi for some centuries, distorted their political outlook.
Utilizing these two facts, the British tried to rally the Muslim
community against India's _freedom struggle_. These divisive
tactics of the British had a temporary success in that they
were able to estrange the _League_ from the Congress in the
years following the partition of Bengal.

It was in this background that the Muslim community
rallied against the British, without fully imbibing the outlook
of modern democracy though, for a whole decade
beginning from the Balkan War to the end of the First World
War. Following the removal of the _Caliph_, their _anti-British_
feelings spread wider than ever before. Thus, they, together
with the non-Muslims who for different reasons had thrown
themselves into the _anti-British_ struggle, gave rise to an
unprecedented mass upsurge. Though for a comparatively
short period, the Muslims rallied along with their non-Muslim
brethren in the _anti-British_ movement.

These developments took place at a time when discontent
had spread among the people on an unprecedented scale.
During and after the war, the misery of the people worsened
day by day. As a consequence of the crop failure in 1918--19,
the production of food grains fell sharply. As against 9.9
million tons of wheat and 35.9 million tons of rice in 1917--18,
the production in 1918--19 was only 7.5 million tons of wheat
and 24.3 million tons of rice. This decline in production,
together with the plunder by traders in foodgrains created
appalling famine conditions in various parts of the country.
The famine together with the epidemics that followed took a
heavy toll of human lives, particularly among the rural poor.
The estimated toll in this catastrophe was put between 12 and 13 million.

At the same time, the Indian economy as a whole was
heading towards a deep crisis. For instance, the ratio of
the prices of goods exported from India to the prices of
goods imported in to india was turning unfavourable to the
country. Taking the prices of imported goods in 1913--14 as 100, it increased to 101 in 1914--15, 126 in 1915--16, 170 in 1916--17,211 in 1917--18 and 268 in 1918--19. At the same time,
the price indices of exports for the same period were 102, 103, 117, 125 and 150 respectively, It was in 1918--19 when the gap
between the two was the widest that famine spread throughout
the country.

Similarly, the relations between the peasants who
produced the agricultural commodities and the wholesale
traders in these articles were adverse to the producers. The
price that the peasants got for essential articles like wheat
and rice was only a small percentage of the price at which
the daily consumer bought them. It was still lower for the
bulk of the peasantry who were compelled to dispose of their
produce immediately after the harvest. Thus, debt of the
peasants increased continuously compelling them to sell their
land. Therefore, there was a rapid increase in the number of
landless labourers who had to eke out a living by daily toil
and of tenant-farmers who had to pay exorbitant rent. The
number of landlords who rented out their land and their
assets also increased simultaneously. This was the condition
in the countryside.

In the urban areas, the exploitation of the workers was
becoming intense. For instance, taking the wages of workers
in 1913 as 100, their wages for the eight years from 1915 to 1922 were 100, 100, 100, 110, 120, 140, 150, and 150. During
the same period the price index (1914=100) was 112, 128, 145, 178, 196, 201, 178, and 176. This meant that the cost of
living was much higher than the cash wages they got. Two
labour leaders from England who came to study the living
conditions of jute workers here were shocked at this state
of affairs.

Along with the exploitation of the workers, the exploitation
of the peasants who produced industrial raw materials
too increased. For example, while the price of raw cotton
increased by only 78 percent, that of cotton textiles shot up
by 108 percent. In short, the British and Indian capitalists
were making exorbitant profits by giving low prices to raw
materials and low wages to the workers and charging high
prices for the manufactured goods.

As a result of all these, discontent had spread deep and
wide both in the country-side and in the urban areas. It was
in these conditions that the Hindu-Muslim leaders of the
Congress and the _Khilafat Committee_ took joint initiative to
organize a new mass upsurge on the issues of the _Jallianwala
Bagh massacre_, _Khilafat_, and so on. Hence, it was natural
that a high-tide of struggles swept across the country based
on Hindu-Muslim unity, defeating the divisive policy of the
British. Though the element of Hindu-Muslim unity lasted
for only a short period, the common phenomenon of _anti-imperialist_
struggle persisted. Thus, the Hindu-Muslim unity
that emerged around the _Khilafat_ helped to sow the seeds of
a country-wide mass movement which advanced in a step-by-step
process, often weakening temporarily before rising
again like the ebb and flood of an ocean tide.

## _NON-COOPERATION_

By the middle of 1920, the three principal issues that
had till then created favourable conditions in Indian politics,
namely, _constitutional reforms_, repression in Punjab and
_Khilafat_, had assumed a more intense form. Both Houses of
the British Parliament had approved the Indian reforms proposals
on 5th and 19th December 1919, On 23rd December,
they received the royal assent. As part of the same
process, the work of the committee to determine economic
relations between the Centre and provinces was completed on 31st March 1920. And the elections (to the provincial legislatures
to be constituted under the new constitution) was due.

The attitude towards the forthcoming elections was discussed
at the Amritsar Congress held in December 1919 which
as noted earlier, gave rise to serious differences of opinion.
Three trends had emerged at Amritsar. One section wanted
to cooperate with the Government in the implementation of
the new reforms, while another section stood for a complete
_boycott_ of the reforms. A third opinion was in favour
of utilizing the new opportunities that would be opened up to
intensify agitations against the Government. Finally, a compromise
resolution was adopted expressing the trust of the
Congress that:

>so far as may be possible the will to so work
the Reforms as to secure an early establishment of full
_Responsible Government_.[^09/2]
 
[^09/2]: A.M. Zaidi, _Ibid_, p. 531.

Since this compromise was temporary, it had become
clear that the issue would have to be discussed afresh
very soon. However, problems relating to the _Jallianwala
Bagh massacre_ and the _Khilafat_ became more acute, which
helped the resolution of the differences of opinion on the
reforms.

Following the publication of the decisions on Turkey
on 15th May 1920, Gandhi suggested to his Muslim friends
to adopt the path of _non-violent_ _non-cooperation_ for the
solution of the _Khilafat_ issue. The _Khilafat Committee_, at
its meeting on 28th May accepted Gandhi's suggestion. On
the same day, the report of the official Jallianwala Bagh
Enquiry Committee was published. The attempt on the
part of the official majority to justify the actions of O'Dwyer
and Dyer aroused protests all over the country. This together
with the _Khilafat Committee_'s decision to take to the path
of _non-cooperation_ created an explosive situation in the
country. In this background, the issue of reforms turned
out to be one of immediate importance. Gandhi who had
pleaded earlier at the Amritsar Congress against taking a
negative attitude towards the reforms changed his stand in
the new situation.

It had been pointed out earlier that Gandhi had given
leadership to implement a programme of _non-cooperation_ on
the _Khilafat_ issue even before the Congress took a final decision
on the elections on the basis of the new constitution. In
a letter addressed to the Viceroy in his capacity as the President
of the _Khilafat Committee_, Gandhi made it clear
that unless the government was willing to find a satisfactory
solution to the _Khilafat_ issue, they would be forced to resort
to _non-cooperation_ towards the Government. This letter was
signed, among others, by 90 prominent Muslim leaders. The
_Khilafat_ sub-committee for _non-cooperation_ had issued a
call to observe 1st August as a _protest day_ with country-wide
_hartals_ and demonstrations.

It was in this background that a special session of
the Congress was held in Calcutta to decide on the policy on
the Reforms. This was the first session of the Congress
held after Tilak's demise. Lala Lajpat Rai, another renowned
'extremist' leader, presided over the session. But what
exerted influence in the _Calcutta Congress_ was not the radical
politics which had grown under the leadership of Tilak,
Lajpat Rai and others, but the Gandhian politics which forged
ahead pushing the former back. In place of the policy of
_conditional cooperation_ enunciated by the unquestioned leader
of the 'extremists', Tilak, unconditional _non-cooperation_ was
adopted. And the person who led the Congress to adopt
the new line was none other than Gandhi who had earlier
pleaded for _unconditional cooperation_ against Tilak's _conditional
cooperation_.

Such a basic change in Indian politics, as in the case of
individual national leaders, did not come about all of a
sudden. Indisputably, Gandhi and others had to brush aside
a number of obstacles in their path before they had adopted
new approaches which every one and themselves knew were
contrary to what they had been taking for a long time. Many
of them had to change the stand they had adopted in 1920,
on the basis of new developments. The new situation which
had brought about the change in each one of them was reflected
in the discussions in the Congress.

For example, at the Amritsar Congress which met
at the end of December 1919, there was only a minority in
favour of _non-cooperation_. Had there been a voting on that
issue, the policy of _non-cooperation_ would have been defeated.
All the top leaders, including Tilak and Gandhi, were
then against _non-cooperation_. By the time the special session
of the Congress was held at Calcutta in September 1920 to
decide the issue, the situation had completely changed. Ву
then Gandhi had turned himself into an advocate of _non-cooperation_.
CR Das, BC Pal, Annie Besant, Malaviya,
Jinnah and other top leaders were in the opposite camp.
In the subjects committee, the resolution on _non-cooperation_
was adopted by a majority of seven votes. But in the plenary
session, it was passed with a large majority, 1886 votes against 884.

According to the constitution of the Congress in force,
a resolution adopted by a special session would come into
force only if it was confirmed by the first plenary session
held after it. Hence, it came up again for discussion at the
regular session in December at Nagpur. By then, opposition
to the resolution had dropped further. Thus, the advocates
of _non-cooperation_ who were a minority just a year earlier
at the Amritsar session became a big majority at the Nagpur
session.

Many historians and political leaders attribute the
"extra-ordinary abilities" of Gandhi to this change. But
they forget the fact that Gandhi had often remained isolated
amongst his colleagues in the Congress. For instance,
Motilal Nehru who was an ardent supporter of Gandhi from
the early days of _non-cooperation_ strongly opposed later the
policy of _non-cooperation_. Similarly, CR Das and some
others who later switched on to the side of _non-cooperation_
subsequently rejected that policy and formed the _Swaraj
Party_. None of Gandhi's "extra-ordinary abilities" worked
on such occasions.

How did then even those political leaders who did not
subscribe to his ideologies and outlook accept his leadership
during the _non-cooperation_ movement as well as in the days of
_Salt Satyagraha_ and _Quit India Struggle_? The resolution on
_non-cooperation_ adopted at the special session of the Congress
held at Calcutta as well as the approach Gandhi adopted in
the various struggles in different periods to which he gave
leadership provide an answer to this question. The programme
of these struggles contained two important elements: a
programme of action capable of drawing the masses into the
struggle based on certain practical problems that were
agitating them; a guarantee to the elite in general and to
the _bourgeoisie_ in particular that they would not lose anything
but would gain much in the event these programmes were
implemented. Consider, for example, the following items that
contained in the programme of _non-cooperation_ adopted at
the special session at Calcutta.

(a) Surrender the titles and honorary offices and resignation
from nominated seats in local bodies;
(b) Refusal to attend Government levee, _durbars_, and
other official and semi-official functions held by Government
officials or in their honour;
(c) Gradual withdrawal of children from schools and
colleges owned, aided or controlled by Government, and in
place of such schools and colleges, establishment of national
schools and colleges in the various provinces;
(d) Gradual _boycott_ of British courts by lawyers and
litigants, and establishment of private arbitration courts by
their aid, for the settlement of private disputes;
(e) Refusal on the part of the military, clerical and
labouring classes to offer themselves as recruits for service
in Mesopotamia;
(f) Withdrawal by candidates for their candidature
for election to the reformed councils, and refusal on the part
of the voters to vote for any candidate who may, despite the
Congress advice, offer himself for elections;
(g) _Boycott_ of foreign goods.

Needless to say, this was a programme, as distinct from
the 'moderate'-radical politics of the old generation as well
as from the 'bomb politics', in which the entire Indian people
could easily participate. There could not be a single individual
in India who could not implement at least one item in
this programme.

Even if the entire programme were implemented, no
section of the Indian vested interests would have lost anything.
On the contrary, the _boycott_ of foreign goods, the last
item of the programme, was in the interest of the developing
Indian capitalists. (In the resolution formulating this seven-point
programme the Congress had advised "adoption of
_Swadeshi_ in piece goods on a vast scale, and inasmuch as the
existing mills of India with indigenous capital and control do
not manufacture sufficient yarn and are not likely to do so
for a long time to come...")

Whenever it had become necessary to fight the British
rule rallying the masses on a big scale as in the 1930--32 and
in 1942 periods, the entire _bourgeois_ political leadership had
accepted Gandhi as their unquestioned leader as they did in 1920--21. And whenever it had become impossible to continue
such a struggle, they had allowed him to withdraw it and
switch over to forms other than that of mass struggle. That
is, the _bourgeois_ political leaders accepted Gandhi as their
"commander-in-chief" during periods of struggle, while at
other times they ignored him as an "impractical idealist". We
shall examine this in the latter chapters. Presently we are
concerned only about the _non-cooperation_ programme of 1920--21. Gandhi adopted in the prevailing circumstances a
form struggle which was more effective than what any other
leader including Tilak, could have thought of. The programme
of _non-cooperation_ made millions feel that it would be useful to
solve the three burning issues which agitated them then. The
greatness of Tilak lay in the fact that he was able to perceive
this truth. It is worth remembering here Tilak's words that
though he felt that the path chosen by Gandhi was wrong,
he would not stand in his way.

The political significance of the Nagpur Congress was
not only that it adopted a programme of country-wide _non-cooperation_
on the three issues of immediate importance,
_viz_, the _Jallianwala Bagh massacre_, the _Khilafat_ and the
_Montagu-Chelmsford reforms_. Organizationally too, it took
certain important decisions to bring it into closer contact
with the masses. The following are some such decisions
which deserve special mention.

1. The Congress adopted a resolution directing the provincial
   committees and other bodies to organize workers into
   trade unions "with a view to improve and promote their
   well-being and secure to them their just rights and also
   to prevent the exploitation"'. (At the same time, it took
   all precaution to keep trade union activities on 'moderate'
   lines, away form the revolutionary path.)
2. It invited "the attention of the public to the policy
   pursued by the Government in the different Provinces of
   India of forcibly acquiring lands... in the interest of
   capitalists... thus destroying the hearths and home
   and the settled occupations of the poor classes and landholders." (It is noteworthy that no anti-landlord slogans
   were raised.)
3. It took certain decisions on the organizational structure
   of the Congress which enabled it to transform itself
   into an organization with activities on a day-to-day basis
   under the leadership of permanent committees at the
   provincial, district and local levels.
4. For the first time, the Congress demanded reorganization
   of provinces on linguistic basis and incorporated that
   principle in its constitution. In place of the multilingual
   states formed by the British for administrative convenience,
   the Congress constituted provincial committees on
   linguistic basis.
5. As part of this, it adopted the mother tongue of each
   province and Hindi-Hindustani at the Centre as official
   languages of the Congress. Non-Hindi-speaking people
   were permitted to use their respective languages or
   English for dealing with the Centre.

Briefly, the Congress which was a resort of a handful
of educated elite, inaccessible to the common man, was
remoulded by changing its style of work and mode of organization
permitting to maintain a more intimate contact with
the masses.

## "_SWARAJ_ IN ONE YEAR"

Gandhi was known to be the architect of the programme
of _non-cooperation_ adopted at the special session of the
Congress at Calcutta in September 1920 and later at its
regular session at Nagpur in December. Hence, the task
of working out the details of the programme also fell on him.
Gandhi became the unquestioned, in its very literal sense,
leader of a mass movement with an unprecedented sweep in
the history of the Congress.

The programme which he worked out and declared with
the central slogan of "_Swaraj_ in one year" created an unprecedented
animation in the country. The programme had
two aspects. One aspect may be called "_constructive programme_"
consisting propagation of _Swadeshi_ (especially the
propagation of hand-spinning and hand-weaving), eradication
of untouchability among Hindus, prohibition of liquor,
collection of Rs. 10 million "_Tilak Swaraj Fund_" instituted in
memory of _Lokmanya_ Tilak, and enrolment of 10 million
members in the Congress. The second aspect may be termed
"negative" which included _boycott_ of legislature, courts and
educational institutions.

The _constructive programme_ was intended to mobilize
people's strength. The content of the second was the form
of struggle to win independence by utilizing the strength thus
mobilized. A combination of the two would give rise to a
great movement with the direct participation of the masses
on an unprecedented scale. Subsequent events demonstrated
the correctness of this calculation.

Three distinct political tendencies were discernible in
the Congress right from its inception up to the "Gandhian
era".

1. 'Moderate' politics in the early days when a handful
   of the intellectual elite met during holidays (mostly during
   the Christmas) and passed resolutions and occasionally
   between two meetings, presented petitions to the authorities,
   thereby trying to bring about minor administrative changes.
2. The second period that followed witnessed the
   tendency of attempts to win national independence or _Swaraj_
   (_Home Rule_) under the "extremist" leadership by inculcating
   political consciousness in the people and drawing them in
   agitational programmes.
3. During the same period, attempts were made by a
   handful of individuals to smash the administration by organizing
   a revolution through adventurist activities.

Of these three trends, the 'extremist' politics was closest
to the people. It was a movement with the active participation
of the people of the lowest, low and middle layers of the
society, such as workers, peasants, the artisans, the unemployed
and students. This feature distinguished 'extremist'
politics from 'moderate' politics, on the one hand, and from
the individual revolutionary politics, on the other.

However, there was an element of similarity between
the 'extremists' and the revolutionaries in the matter of organization
based on dedicated activists and in this both were
distinct from the 'moderates'. But unlike those who believed
in the "politics of the bomb", the 'extremists' considered it
the task of the dedicated members of their movement to
inspire and enthuse the masses of the people and bring them
into a mass movement.

In fact, Tilak earned the fame as the tallest among the
radical leaders by drawing the millions into active politics
and by raising a group of dedicated workers to stand in the
forefront of the people. But there was an important difference
between the politics of Tilak and the emerging Gandhian
politics. The role of the millions participating in the politics
led by Tilak was relatively passive. Their role was limited
to listening to the speeches of the leaders, reading newspapers
and leaflets and participating in demonstrations, whereas
each individual rallied under Gandhi's leadership had his
own part to play in the struggle.

Every individual participating in the Gandhian movement
was duty-bound to enroll himself a member of the Congress,
contribute to the _Tilak Swaraj Fund_, do spinning on _takli_ or
_charkha_, renounce the liquor and the practice of untouchability
and endeavour to build up Hindu-Muslim unity. Those who
were in government service were to quit the job; those who
held honours or titles conferred by the government were to
renounce them; the lawyers to give up legal practice and
parents to withdraw their children from educational institutions
connected with the government. All these made an inseparable
part of the _non-cooperation_ programme. There could
hardly be an individual who could not implement on his own
at least one item in this all-embracing programme. It was
thus a programme which attracted the Indian people as a
whole to active politics.

Gandhi told the people that if they were prepared to do
all these, the British Government would be compelled to
concede the national demand of "_Swaraj_ in one year". Gandhi's
contribution to the national movement consisted in the
fact that he drew the entire Indian people into action by
linking up one's daily tasks and duties to the demand of
national independence.

The country-wide tour Gandhi conducted to propagate
his programme inspired millions. The collections to _Tilak
Swaraj Fund_ surpassed all expectations (Rs. 1.5 million more
than the target of Rs. 10 million). Thousands of students
and hundreds of lawyers implemented the _boycott_ programme.
Although a number of them later stopped the _boycott_
and returned to the classrooms and courts, many continued
to be active in Congress politics or in such constructive work
as popularization of _Khadi_ and Hindi, eradication of untouchability
and so on. Many became whole-time activists in
the national movement.

Boycotting foreign textiles was an important item in the
_boycott_ programme. Unlike the _boycott_ of educational
institutions or courts, the entire people could take part in it.
It became a common practice to make a bonfire of foreign
cloth worth several thousand rupees în public places. Although
many prominent Congress leaders, including Vithalbhai
Patel, publicly opposed this programme, the _All-India Congress
Committee (AICC)_, under Gandhi's leadership, approved it.

The _boycott_ of the visit of the Prince of Wales to India
was the most successful programme with the widest popular
response. The rulers were expecting the Prince's visit as an
opportunity to wean away at least a section of the people
from the Congress which was going ahead with the programme
of _non-cooperation_. For this very reason, the Congress
was determined to make the _boycott_ of the visit a great
success. In the major cities like Bombay and Calcutta,
people participated massively in the protest demonstrations.
Gandhi himself addressed a massive rally in Bombay.
In Bombay and other cities, the workers came out of factories
to participate in the demonstrations. The burning of
foreign textiles also was widespread. All these were peaceful
everywhere except in Bombay.

In Bombay where the Prince disembarked, the royalists
had arranged a procession to welcome him. The people were
furious at the Indians and Europeans participating in the
royal procession. There were stone-throwing and other acts
of violence like the destruction of trams and motor vehicles.
Foreign hats of the Indian and British dignitaries were snatched
away. Even the supporters of the royal procession
were attacked.

Following this, there was firing by the police and armed
counter-attacks by the royalists. Those wearing _Khadi_ were
attacked and a number of Congress volunteers were injured.

The riots that ensued lasted for five days. All
communities and sections of the people, the Parsees, Muslims,
Christians and the Anglo Indians in their respective areas
and the mill workers in the industrial area came out on the
streets. The Parsees, in particular, took to revengeful actions.
Europeans, Jews and other royalists took law in their own
hands and attacked Hindus and Muslims and all those clad
in _Khadi_. Many shops were burned down and a Parsee temple
was set on fire. Many prominent Indians who tried to pacify
the people were roughly treated by the Parsees and. AngloIndians.
According to the official estimate, 53 persons were
killed and 400 injured.

Gandhi said that 45 out of 53 killed and 350 out of 400
injured were either members of the _non-cooperation_ movement
or its sympathizers. Its meaning was obvious: the
main culprits were the Government and its henchmen. That
the _boycott_ at other places was peaceful strengthened this
conclusion.

However, Gandhi blamed the people, and not the rulers,
for the violence in Bombay. Reacting to these violent incidents
he said: "The _Swaraj_ I have witnessed during the last two
days has stunk in my nostrils."

This event had another repercussion. The _civil disobedience
movement_ scheduled to be launched in the Bardoli
district of Gujarat on 23rd November was put off. This
constitutes one of the peculiarities of Gandhi's _non-cooperation_-_civil
disobedience programmes_. Whenever small
incidents take place somewhere as people, responding to his
call, start organized struggles against imperialism and its
henchmen, Gandhi would immediately put off the struggle in
the name of such incidents. This we would see repeatedly
in the following chapters. Whenever he stopped struggles
in this manner, he always left opportunities to launch it again
when favourable conditions arose. That is, whenever he
starts a struggle, Gandhi makes provisions to withdraw it
when necessary and to restart it under favourable conditions.

Gandhi's slogan of "_Swaraj_ in one year" was part of
this tactic. Gandhi, the pragmatist, understood that political
conditions never remained the same over time. He knew
that political conditions would change within a year, which
would necessitate changes in the programmes and that what
was essential was to make people realize about things to be
done in the next one year. It was on this perspective that
Gandhi formulated the programme incorporating certain
practical items like raising the _Tilak Swaraj Fund_.

During that one year, many events took place which none,
including Gandhi, had anticipated. Certain developments
which Gandhi anticipated also did take place. As a result,
both the British rulers and the Congress had to change their
earlier positions. The political situation also changed as a
sequel to the moves made by both the sides.

However, the Gandhian style of functioning of drawing
millions of people into active politics around short term practical
slogans and rearing up a group of whole-time political
workers to lead them continued without any basic change
till the attainment of freedom. So also Gandhi's insistence
that the masses who came into active politics should not
cross the "bounds" of _non-violence_ continued unaltered.
The class which was to stand benefited by these tactics needs
no specific mention.

## THE "HIMALAYAN BLUNDER"

The visit of the Prince of Wales to India and the protest
demonstrations organized by the Congress led by Gandhi
marked a turning point in Indian politics. Till then, the
British rulers did not have a firm opinion as to how to meet
the _non-cooperation_ movement. They desired to seek the
cooperation of Gandhi and other leaders of the movement
to the extent possible. 'Viceroy Lord Reading had talks with
Gandhi to persuade him to drop the protest demonstrations
against the Prince. Since Gandhi was convinced during the
talks that the Government was not willing to come anywhere
near the main demands of the _non-cooperation_ movement, he
decided to go ahead with the _non-cooperation_ programme as
planned.

Even at this stage, the authorities tried to rally whomsoever
possible against the Congress and make them participate
in the royal reception. But contrary to their hopes, they
witnessed country-wide expressions of people's anger. As we
have already noted, the protest demonstrations were peaceful
everywhere except in Bombay.

This infuriated the ruling authorities, who adopted a
policy of naked hostility towards the _non-cooperation_ movement
and the Congress. In a cable to the Secretary of State
for India, the Viceroy pointed to the "dangerous situation"
developed in the country following the 19th November incidents
and to the futility of the ordinary criminal procedures
to meet the new situation arising out of the mill workers, the
unemployed and other sections of the people joining the _non-cooperation_
movement. The Viceroy also informed him of the
actions being taken by his Government, _viz._, giving permission
to local authorities to freely make use of the military, banning
organizations, subjecting people to large-scale arrests and
punishing them in other ways, prosecuting newspapers and
speakers promoting violence, and so on.

The governmental measures described in the message
undoubtedly constituted an open declaration of war against the
people and the _non-cooperation_ movement. And the Congress
leaders in different provinces came forward to meet
it in the same spirit. Many prominent Congress leaders like
CR Das, Motilal Nehru, Lajpat Rai, and Maulana Azad disobeyed
law and courted arrest. This was synchronized with
_civil disobedience_ by hundreds of Congress volunteers and
members of the public at different places all over the country.
Even members of the family and other relatives of prominent
leaders participated in such actions. Prisons in many
provinces were filled with volunteers and the common people.
In some places, the authorities ordered the release of political
prisoners to make rooms for the newly arrested and when
they refused to leave, they were forcibly ejected. In certain
other places, as there was no room in jails, prisoners were
taken to distant places and let off. It became clear to the
rulers that a people unbending before repression was rising
in India.

It was in this background that the Ahmedabad session of
the Congress was held in December 1921. Since CR Das
who was to preside over the session had been arrested a few
days earlier, Hakim Ajmal Khan took over as president.
But, a situation had developed by then wherein it would be
Gandhi who would in effect be controlling the proceedings of
the session, irrespective of who presided over it. Gandhi's
was the final verdict on all issues which came up for discussion.

Two trends of thought contrary to that of Gandhi were
expressed, very feebly though, in the Ahmedabad session of
the Congress. Pandit Malaviya was of the opinion that the
Congress should take the initiative to call a _Round Table
Conference_ in order to normalize the relation between the
Congress and the Government. Maulana Hazrat Mohani,
on the other hand, set the objective of winning _complete
independence_ severing all connections with British imperialism
and argued for a revolutionary method in accordance
with that objective. (Along with the latter, another trend of
opinion with working class outlook was circulated before the
delegates in the form of a leaflet entitled "_Communist
Manifesto to Ahmedabad Congress_".

Many Congress leaders supported the first trend. Even
some of those who were in jails subscribed to this view.
Later, they left the Gandhian path and formed the _Swaraj
Party_. The second trend had considerable influence among
ordinary _Congressmen_. A section of them later on turned
themselves into leftist _Congressmen_, Socialists, and Communists.
But at Ahmedabad, both these sections were so weak
that Gandhi was able to get the Congress adopt his own
views and approve his programme challenging the British
rule by organizing _non-violent_ _non-cooperation_ struggles.
Consequently, Gandhi was raised to the position of a leader
with the powers of a commander-in-chief.

This turn of events was most disturbing to the 'moderates',
both inside and outside the Congress. Jinnah who had left
the Congress with the adoption of the _non-cooperation_ programme,
former Congress President Sankaran Nair,
Malaviya, well-known as a 'moderate' inside the Congress,
and others continued their efforts to bring about an understanding
between the Government and the Congress. In
this connection, Malaviya visited CR Das in jail and held
a talk with him. Subhas Bose who was a co-prisoner in the
jail wrote:

When Sapru, Jinnah and Malaviya started negotiating
with the Government, the Congress Committee postponed the
launching of the Bardoli _civil disobedience_. As the negotiations
failed, the struggle was launched as an indication of the
coming country-wide disobedience movement. People not
only in Bardoli but all over India were highly agitated.

Bardoli was only the centre of the country-wide disobedience
movement which took different forms in different
places. The _boycott_ of foreign cloths, picketing the shops
selling foreign cloths, and propaganda for _hartals_ and
closing shops and for the _boycott_ of educational institutions
were carried out extensively. There were thousands of
active workers and tens of thousands of people who participated
in these activities in almost all districts.

However, the most important of all these was the _civil
disobedience_ conducted by the peasants. In Rae Bareily
and Faizabad in UP, Malegaon in Maharashtra, Giridih in
Bihar, Dharwar in Karnataka, Chiralaperala in Andhra, in
Malabar in Kerala and in many other areas, the peasants
responded to Gandhi's call for the _non-cooperation_ form of
political struggle making it part of their struggle raising their
own demands. It was the most militant struggle fought by
the peasants since the suppression of the 1857--59 revolt.
Agrarian issues like taxes, rent, and eviction by landlords
were raised linking them with the political struggle for independence.
This provided for the first time, a mass base for
the independence movement.

This was exactly what, in Gandhi's views, "defeated"
the _non-cooperation_ movement. This was because, for the
first time in the history of the freedom movement, the peasants
who had stepped into the political field as an organized
force were not prepared to remain within the bounds of _non-violence_
set by Gandhi. They had their own aims and forms
of struggle which did not always go hand in hand with those
set by Gandhi.

The most conspicuous demonstration of this was the
incident that took place in _Chauri Chaura_ in the _Gorakhpur_
district. Following a picketing of shops conducted as part
of the _non-cooperation_ programme, there was none there to buy
foreign cloth or liquor. Some volunteers who had
created an atmosphere of national fervour were beaten up
by a police officer. Hearing the news, volunteers from the
adjoining villages rushed to the spot and a 500 strong crowd
marched towards the police station. Some mediators pacified
them and they returned. Some volunteers who were
thus returning were again attacked by the police, resulting
in a fight between the volunteers and police who opened fire
killing a number of volunteers. But the clash still continued.
Soon the police ran out of ammunition and ceased firing. The
volunteers realizing this, rushed towards the police station.
The policemen took refuge in the station bolting the doors.
The people set fire to the station burning the policemen to
death.

This type of events are not uncommon in the history
of revolutionary movements. It is natural that such incidents
take place when the state that strives to suppress people's
movements and the militant people come to a confrontation
with each other. But Gandhi was not leading a revolution.
Gandhi was a leader who, like the rulers, was afraid of
"violence on the part of the people".

We have already seen how Gandhi viewed the "violence
on the part of the people" in Bombay when they were protesting
against the visit of the Prince of Wales. This was
exactly what happened in _Chauri Chaura_ also. On the _Chauri
Chaura_ incident he said: The events in Malabar was a
warning to me. I ignored it. Now through the _Chauri Chaura_
incident, God has repeated that warning.

As the leader of the movement, he accepted the truth
that the police had provoked the people at _Chauri Chaura_.
But he was insistent that the people should maintain
_non-violence_ in the face of any provocation. According to him,
so far as the people did not have the necessary training for
it, _civil disobedience_ was dangerous. Hence, following the
_Chauri Chaura_ incident, Gandhi stopped the _civil disobedience
movement_. He was of the view that to continue the movement in
the existing circumstances would be a "Himalayan
blunder".
