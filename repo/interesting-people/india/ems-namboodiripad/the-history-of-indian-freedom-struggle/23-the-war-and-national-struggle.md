#  THE WAR AND NATIONAL STRUGGLE

## THREAT OF WAR: DIFFERENT VIEWS

The aggressive actions of Hitler after his assumption of
power in Germany created the fear that a new war more
devastating than the First World War might break out soon.
In Asia, this fear was strengthened by the Japanese invasion
of China.

A section of the Indian _bourgeoisie_ evaluated the new
situation on the line that the war which appeared imminent
would offer tremendous opportunities for gaining national
independence. We have noted earlier that the view that
"_England's need is India's opportunity_" was widespread
among _bourgeois_ political circles in India during the First
World War. Besides, basing on the view that "England's
peril is India's opportunity", a section of Indian revolutionaries
tried to carry out a programme of creating as much
problem as possible to the British rulers during the war and
organizing an armed revolt in India with the assistance of
their enemy, Germany, as well as of the USA and Canada
which, though friendly to Britain, were trying to weaken
her. The same view was maintained by a section led by
Subhas Bose with regard to the military threat posed by
Fascist Germany and Militarist Japan now. When Germany
had started conquering the European countries one by one
and Japan had invaded part of the Chinese territories, this
section of the _bourgeois_ nationalists expressed sympathy
with these forces which were rising against the world domination
of Britain. They calculated that these _anti-British_
forces could be utilized to India's advantage.

As we have indicated earlier, the attitude of Nehru and
the right-wing leaders of the Congress including Gandhi was
opposed to this. This does not, however, mean that Nehru
or the right-wing leaders never held the view that 'England's
peril is India's opportunity'. The difference between Bose
and these leaders were, in fact, over the question of how to
utilize England's 'peril' as an opportunity' for India. Unlike
Bose, Gandhi and other right-wing leaders did not view the
fascist powers as helpful to India's independence struggle.
They were thinking in terms of taking advantage of Britain's
peril to bargain with the British with a view to wrest maximum
concession from them and to get the political power
transferred from the British to Indians. Before considering
the details of the clash between these two approaches, it is
necessary to point out that Nehru, the right-wing Congress
leaders including Gandhi, and Bose were now representing,
in the ways characteristic of each of them, the Indian _bourgeoisie_
which had become more mature and powerful than
at the time of the First World War.

The limited programme of industrialization which the
British were forced to carry out in India during and after
the First World War had helped the growth of Indian _bourgeoisie_.
They registered tremendous growth both in terms
of number and assets. In the sphere of politics, a series of
political actions such as the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_ movements,
the emergence of the _Swaraj Party_, the _civil disobedience
movement_s of 1930--1932 and the parliamentary
programme that followed had made the _bourgeoisie_ a powerful
class. It had acquired the capability to rally the entire
masses against the imperialist domination and to bargain with
British rulers on the strength of this organized popular force.
This process reached its culmination towards the end of 1930s when the political party of the _bourgeoisie_ --- the Congress --- had
been able to consolidate its mass base more than
ever before. The Congress ministries which assumed power
in the provinces in 1937 helped the _bourgeoisie_ to muster
enough strength to challenge the British rulers.

In 1937 Congress ministers in the provinces holding the
portfolios of Industry and Labour held discussions among
themselves under the auspices of the Congress. These discussions
were followed by a conference of Congress chief
ministers in May 1938. Although the conference brought
out a number of economic problems they had to handle as
provincial ministers, the conference ended with the formation
of a _National Planning Committee_. In his inaugural address
Congress President Bose set the objective of introducing an
industrial revolution as rapidly and organized a way as it
had happened in the Soviet Union. Jawaharlal Nehru was
appointed chairman of the _Planning Committee_. The formation
of the _Planning Committee_ on the initiative of a well
known leftist leader and chaired by another was an important
event in the history of planning process in India. This
was the forerunner of what is known as the _Bombay Plan_
prepared on the initiative of the eminent industrialists Tata
and Birla during the Second World War and the countrywide
discussions that followed.

The formation of the _National Planning Committee_
marked an important milestone in the growth of Indian
_bourgeoisie_. It was a clear evidence to show that the
_bourgeoisie_ had already started making attempts to prepare
the outlines of economic development of "free" India in
parallel the struggles to get the political power transferred
from the British. It may be noted that even before this
Sir M. Visweswarayya had prepared a plan for India's
economic development on the capitalist lines. But this was
the result of his personal efforts. Now following the sharing
of power by the Congress in the provinces, the _bourgeoisie_
was getting engaged in a collective thinking on a countrywide
activity for economic construction.

As soon as the thinking on planning started, difference
of opinion surfaced between the _Planning Committee_ and
Gandhi on the one hand and between members of the Committee
and Nehru, on the other. These were the manifestations
of the differences that existed among the different sections
of the _bourgeois_ leadership on the direction of planning.
But all of them agreed on the point that since the transfer of
power to the Indians would take place before long, it was
necessary right now to start thinking as to how Indian
economy had to be reconstructed after the transfer of power.
In other words, the leaders belonging to different political
persuasions who agreed on the need to formulate a plan
for reorganizing the society in post-independent India, differed
from each other on the question of the nature of this reorganization.

Yet, the problem remained as to how to get the power
transferred to the Indians. Two methods were suggested. One
of the methods suggested was to seize power from the British
by organizing armed revolts with the assistance of the fascist
forces on the basis of the logic of "enemy's enemy". Subhas
Bose was the main spokesman of this method. Nehru and
the right-wing Congress leaders including Gandhi, on the
other hand, regarded the war as an opportunity to effectively
bargain with the British. Consequently, they remained in the
camp of the world revolutionary movement against the fascist
forces which were opposed to Britain.

This difference of opinion came into the open only after
the war broke out. Till now the Congress had been taking
decisions on international issues unanimously. All the
resolutions adopted by the Congress sessions and the _AICC_
meetings on each of the aggressive actions taken by Italy,
Germany and Japan were in consonance with the attitudes
of the world _anti-fascist_ movement. Although it was Nehru
who was in the forefront in drafting and explaining these
resolutions, they had enjoyed the support of Bose as well as
the right-wing leaders including Gandhi. This was because
the imperialist powers including Britain had been abetting
the fascist aggressions. The rebellion in Spain led by Gen.
Franco, Hitler's actions against Austria and Czechoslovakia
and Japan's invasion of China had the backing of Britain.
Therefore, the movement against fascism and war turned out
to be a movement against British imperialism also. The entire
_anti-fascist_ movement took the form of _anti-imperialism_.
Thus even to those who were thinking in terms of seeking
the assistance of the fascist forces after the breakout of
the war it was not difficult to take an _anti-fascist_ stand before
the war.

However, Bose and the right-wing Congress leadership
came to a clash with each other over the question of how to
utilize the situation that might arise out of the war between
the fascist forces and the imperialist forces including Britain,
which they knew was inevitable, to the advantage of India.
Gandhi and the right-wing leaders were thinking in terms of
effecting the transfer of power by bargaining with Britain
which was caught up in a dangerous crisis. As we have repeatedly
pointed out earlier, Bose was trying to organize an
armed revolt in India with the assistance of the fascist forces.

Bose's approach was partly shared by Jinnah who was
suspicious of Britain's "semi-honeymoon" with the right-wing
Congress leadership. He sent AR Siddiqi and Khaliquzzaman
to Europe in 1939 to contact the Italian and German
governments.[^23/1] But there was a significant difference between
Bose and Jinnah, which needs particular mention. Unlike
Bose, Jinnah was not seeking the assistance of the fascist
forces to organize an armed revolt in India. He was also
thinking in terms of a bargain with the British. But when he
felt that the British rulers were showing the tendency of moving
closer to the Congress, he contacted the fascist forces as
a counter-move. In other words, Jinnah simply began to
make an attempt to bargain with the fascist forces as part
of the policy of bargaining with the British, which he shared
with Gandhi and other right-wing Congress leaders. When
the "semi-honeymoon" of the British with the Congress ended,
he re-established relations with the British.

[^23/1]: S. Gopal, _Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography_, Bombay, Oxford University Press, 1976, p. 240.

As distinct from the right-wing Congress leaders, Bose
and Jinnah, the Communists had taken a stand which was
simultaneously _anti-fascist_ and _anti-British_. Theirs was an
approach which linked together the objective of preventing
the advance of fascism and strengthening the _anti-British_
struggle. They opposed both the right-wing policy of bargaining
with the British and the policy of liberating India from
the British rule with the assistance of the fascist forces pursued
by Bose. The method adopted by the Communist was
to organize workers' strikes, peasants' struggles and other
forms of revolutionary struggles and to link the Indian independence
struggle to the growing world movement against
fascism. The right-wing leadership of the _Congress Socialist
Party_ and Nehru adopted the same stand until the war broke
out. But owing to their relationship with the right-wing
leadership of the Congress, they failed to adopt the policy
of an uncompromising struggle against imperialism. Thus,
soon after the war started they and the _Communist Party_
began to move along different paths.

## THE IMPACT OF THE WAR

Before the outbreak of the war in September 1939 it
was anticipated that the Second World War would be fought
out between _Nazi_ Germany on the one side and the Soviet
Union and other European Powers like Britain and France
on the other. It was in anticipation of such a war that the
Soviet Union and the _Communist International_ were working.
But the war did not start that way.

On 24th August 1939 the news broke out surprising the
world that the Soviet Union and Germany had signed a _no-war
pact_. By securing her eastern borders through this pact,
Germany turned towards the west.

The _Nazi_ forces attacked Poland first. Soon after the
attack, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain
made a statement that since Poland was an ally of Britain,
the attack on Poland was an attack on Britain. He issued
an ultimatum to Germany that if the _Nazi_ forces did not
withdraw from Poland immediately, Britain would declare
war on Germany. As Hitler did not heed the ultimatum,
Britain declared war on Germany.

Thus, the war started between Germany and Britain and
not between Germany and Soviet Union. The Soviet Union,
the only power capable of rescuing Poland by joining hands
with Britain, was keeping out of the war. Britain, on the
other hand, could not come to the rescue of Poland because
she had no direct access to that country without crossing
other countries. Thus, the British assurance to Poland and her
declaration of war on Germany remained only on paper. In
a few days Germany conquered Poland.

There is relatively long history behind such a turn of
events. Right from the days of the _October Revolution_, the
imperialist powers including Britain had adopted different tactics
to destroy the Soviet Union. When all these tactics failed,
they encouraged Hitler's aggressive activities as part of
their foreign policy of providing all opportunities for Germany
to become a mighty military power against the Soviet
Union and the world Communist movement and aiding her
aggressive acts while pretending to oppose them. When
Germany conquered Austria and Czechoslovakia, Britain
approved of these actions through the _League of Nations_.
_The Munich Pact_ is a standing testimony to their betrayal
of Czechoslovakia to the _Nazis_. When world public
opinion, including that of their own, became irresistible, the
rulers of the West European countries took an apparently
_anti-fascist_ stand. They nominally put forward the opinion
that the Soviet Union in the east and Britain and France in
the west must join hands together and co-operate militarily
in order to stall the advance of Hitler. Apart from declaring
their wish they refused to take any action in this regard.
Instead of holding discussions in a serious way to face the
dangerous situation, they were putting them off indefinitely.

There was a reason behind this ambivalence on the part
of Britain. They wanted to push the Soviet Union, the consistent
enemy of fascism, into a war against Germany while
keeping themselves aloof from it and provide an opportunity
to Hitler to destroy the Soviet Union. Leaders of the Soviet
Union saw through this imperialist design. The Soviet-German
_no-war pact_ was a clever counter-move to this imperialist
design.

Hitler could now turn westwards. A few months after
the fall of Poland, Hitler conquered the entire Western Europe
including France and made an unprecedented bombardment
on Britain with a view to conquering her. The German army
even landed on the British Isles. It was feared that Britain
too would be conquered soon. All this exposed the bankruptcy
of the policies Britain and France had been following
in the pre-war years. Chamberlain who gained notoriety as
being the author of this policy was removed from the Prime
Ministership. Churchill who stood for halting the _Nazi_
onslaught with the cooperation of the Soviet Union took over
as the Prime Minister.

Later when Hitler turned eastwards and attacked the
Soviet Union, the _anti-fascist_ front envisaged by the Soviet
Union and the _Communist International_ came into being in 1941. In the historic counter-attack launched by the Soviet
people combined with the guerrilla attacks organized by the
people in the German occupied countries and the onslaughts
of the American and British forces, the _Nazi_ forces were
completely destroyed.

To anyone who examines the later events it would be
clear now that the Soviet-German _no-war pact_ was a clever
move on the part of the Soviet Union to expose and oppose
the strategy of the imperialist powers of turning Hitler against
the Soviet Union without engaging themselves in the war.
But the situation prevailing then was different. The news
that the Soviet leaders who were engaged themselves for a
long time in rallying the people around the world against
Hitler suddenly entered into a pact with him shocked the
world. This created confusion even in the Communist parties
in many countries. _Non-Communist_ _anti-imperialists_ added
to the _anti-Soviet_ feelings by their sharp criticism of the
"opportunist policy of the Soviet leaders". This was reflected
in Indian politics too. _Indian Communists_ too were confused.
The _anti-Communists_ among the Socialists and in other left
parties, on the other hand, used this opportunity to whip up
anti-Communism and _anti-Sovietism_ that was growing in the
left-parties. The left-unity which was built up with strenuous
efforts reached a near collapse.

There were serious differences within the Congress
leadership too, which were not confined to the problem of
the Soviet-German pact. The entire approach towards the
war and towards Britain which was involved in the war
became the subject for discussion. Gandhi and other right-wing
Congress leaders expressed the opinion that it would be
wise to cooperate with the British in their war efforts. The
Congress ministers in the provinces came forward to carry out
the programmes prepared by the Governors and the British
officials for the prosecution of the war. The Madras Chief
Minister Rajagopalachari was ready to take certain actions
(such as detaining Germans which even the Governor considered
high-handed). But Nehru and some other Congress
leaders were opposed to this. They were not prepared to be
drawn into the war which was declared without consulting
the people of India, their elected representatives, and to allow
Indian men and materials to be used for the prosecution
of the war. They argued that there was no question of the
Congress cooperating with the British in the war unless the
government was prepared to concede the main demand raised
by the Congress before the outbreak of the war, namely, the
transfer of the administration at the Centre to the Indian people's
representatives. In the words of Pattabhi Sitaramayya:

>Gandhi was of the view that we must offer our moral support,
allow the ministries to function, and he had the confidence
that through the ministers, he could manoeuvre a
declaration of _Purna Swaraj_ or _Dominion Status_, a
declaration of the next step of the same that Jawaharlal
expected by negotiation. In both cases the contingency of
a promise not being fulfilled did exist, but under Gandhi's
technique, the chance of the fulfilment of such a declaration
was certainly greater.[^23/2]

[^23/2]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _op. cit_, p. 130.

In other words, it was the aim of both the left and right-wing
leadership of the Congress including Gandhi and Nehru
to utilize the war situation and get power transferred from
the British. While Gandhi believed that it would be useful
to assure unconditional assistance to Britain in her war efforts
for achieving the objective, Nehru thought it more prudent
to ask the British to declare her war aims clearly.

Since the difference between these two approaches could
not be resolved, the leadership could not decide its attitude
towards the war immediately after it broke out. Meeting the
Viceroy in response to his invitation in early September,
Gandhi told him that his sympathies were with England and
France. Contradicting the views expressed by Gandhi in
several of his statements, Nehru issued a number of statements
sharply criticizing the roles being played by Britain in world
politics and in the affairs of India. After all these controversies,
the _Congress Working Committee_ which met on 14th
September adopted a resolution which may be summarized
as follows.

1. The Congress is sympathetic to the objective of the
   war in which England and France are involved. It is a war for
   democracy and against the imperialist and fascist powers.
   However, India is a country which has been fighting against
   the denial of freedom and peace in the country for about a
   century and a half. In this war the people in the _Dominion
   States_ who are participating on the side of Britain are doing
   it in accordance with the decisions taken by their respective
   parliaments. India, on the other hand, had been forced into
   the war by the imperial power without consulting her people.
   The government at the Centre which is not responsible to the
   people is taking all the decisions in this regard. India cannot
   submit to this.
2. In the final analysis, it is for the provincial governments
   to take all actions with regard to the war. These
   governments must have the necessary powers to function
   accordingly.
3. Past experience, particularly of the First World
   War, does not allow the Congress to take the war-time declarations 
   being made by the British government at their face
   value. Therefore, along with making an unambiguous statement
   about the future of India, the rulers should make clear
   what they propose to do to implement the principles contained
   in the declaration immediately.

The _Working Committee_ declared that as long as the
government was not prepared to make its stand clear, the
Congress would not be able to fully co-operate with the
government in its war efforts.

It is clear that the resolution embodies more of the
approach of Nehru than Gandhi's. Accordingly, Gandhi
proposed that Nehru should take over the presidentship form
Rajendra Prasad and nominate a _Working Committee_ of his
choice. Rajendra Prasad offered his resignation but for
various reasons the proposed change did not take place and
the existing team continued.

Thus, in the first weeks of the war considerable confusion
and uncertainty prevailed in the _bourgeois_ leadership of
the Congress too. The official policy of the Congress during
this time was characterized by the presence of a number of
contradictory elements such as agreement with the war objective
of the British, _non-cooperation_ with Britain's war efforts
in protest against her policies towards India, while at the same
time the continuance of the provincial ministries which
were expected to play significant roles in the prosecution of
the war.

The _bourgeois_ leadership was not prepared to rally the
people in an anti-war movement making use of the revolutionary
idea contained in the slogan of 'Britain's war is
India's opportunity'. Nor were they prepared to unconditionally
cooperate with the British as proposed by Gandhi now
and by the 'moderates' earlier. But matters were moving in
such a way that it was impossible to hold on the existing
policies.

## THE POLITICS OF RESIGNATION

The resolution adopted by the _Working Committee_ on 14th September left the door open for negotiations with the
British rulers. Following, both the parties raised arguments
and counter-arguments through press statements. The polemics
showed that the gulf that existed between the two
camps was unbridgeable. The British government was not
prepared to declare its war aims as demanded by the Congress.
Nor did it concede the demand raised by the Congress
with regard to the administration at the Centre. The Congress,
on the other hand, held firm the position that unless
these two demands were conceded, it would be impossible
for it extend cooperation to the British in their war efforts.
The opinion spread in the Congress ranks that it was not
proper for the Congress ministries to continue in office in
the prevailing circumstances. Nehru and many other Congress
leaders were in favour of this opinion.

Besides, the _Communist Party_, the _Congress Socialist
Party_ and Subhas Bose had been conducting powerful agitations
against the continuance of the Congress ministries.
All this compelled the right-wing leadership including Gandhi
to adopt the policy of resignation of the ministries. A
decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the _AICC_
held on 9--10th October. In the light of the statements
issued later, the _Working Committee_ confirmed the decision.

The decision was that the ministries should submit resignation
by 31st October. It was also proposed that an extraordinary
meeting of the provincial legislatures should be
called before the resignation of the ministries to adopt the
following resolution:

>This Assembly regrets that the British Government have
>made India a participant in the war between Great Britain
>and Germany without the consent of the people and have
>further in complete disregard of the Indian opinion passed
>laws and adopted measures curtailing the powers and
>activities of the Provincial Governments.
>
>The Assembly recommends to the Government to convey
>to the Government of India and through them to the
>British Government that in consonance with the avowed
>aims of the present war, it is essential in order to secure
>the co-operation of the Indian people that the principles
>of democracy with effective safeguards for the Muslims
>and other minorities be applied to India and her policy be
>guided by her people; and that India should be regarded
>as an independent nation entitled to frame her own
>constitution and further that suitable action should be
>taken in so far as it is possible in the immediate present
>to give effect to that principle in regard to the present
>governance of India.
>
>This Assembly regrets that the situation in India has not
>been rightly understood by His Majesty's Government
>when authorising the statement that has been made on
>their behalf in regard to India and in view of this failure
>of the British Government to meet India's demand, this
>Assembly is of the opinion that the Government cannot
>associate itself with the British policy.[^23/3]

[^23/3]: _Ibid_, p. 142.

It is clear that the resolution is an expression of the views
and demands of that section of the _bourgeois_ which was represented
by the Congress. It was in fact a compromise between
Gandhi who wanted to extend _unconditional cooperation_
to the British government and Nehru who argued that Britain's
attitude towards India should be considered as a touchstone
to test the sincerity of the British clain that it was fighting
against fascism and for democracy. Like the 14th September
resolution, this resolution also was one that left the door open
for negotiations even after the resignation of the Congress
ministries. For the same reason, the Congress leaders did not
provide an answer to the question: 'After the resignation,
what?'.

In addition to the British, the Congress had to face also
the _Muslim League_ which had been growing as a political
party in all provinces since the 1937 elections. Its leadership
had been bargaining with the British on the one side and
with the Congress on the other. It did not oppose the resolution
moved by the Congress in the provincial legislatures
regretting the British action of declaring "India a belligerent
country without the consent of the Indian people". They
simply introduced an amendment which reads as follows:

>This Assembly recommends to the Government to convey
to the Government of India and through them to his
Majesty's Government that they should, when considering
the question of India's constitution either during the
duration of the war, and after it is concluded, bear in mind
that the democratic parliamentary system of Government
under the present constitution has failed, being utterly unsuited
to the conditions and genius of the people and,
further, apart from the _Government of India Act_ of 1935,
entire problems of India's future constitution should be
wholly reviewed and revised _de novo_ and the British Government
should not make any commitment in principle or
otherwise without the approval and consent of the _All
India Muslim League_, which alone represents, and can speak
on behalf the _Mussalmans_ of India, as well as without
the consent of all important minorities and interests.[^23/4]

[^23/4]: _Ibid_, p. 143.

It is clear form this amendment that the _Muslim League_
had now entered the political scene as the representative of a
section of the _bourgeoisie_ with interests which are different
and even opposed to that of the Congress. This section of
the _bourgeoisie_ also could not compromise with the interests
of the British _bourgeoisie_. They could not express their
contradictions with that section of the _bourgeoisie_ which was
represented by the Congress without taking an attitude
against the British _bourgeoisie_. At the same time, they
feared that if power was transferred as a result of the bargain
between the Congress as the sole representative of the
Indian people and the British, it might adversely affect their
own interests. Therefore, the section of the _bourgeoisie_
represented by the _League_ claimed their right to intervene
effectively in the negotiations between the Congress and the
government.

Although, in the final analysis, the Congress and the
_Muslim League_ represented the same _bourgeois_ class, there
was a significant difference between the policies and approaches
of the leaderships of this class. The Congress possessed a
leadership which had been bargaining with the British government
on the basis of the mass strength gained through
drawing the people in struggles and agitations. It has an
organization which has conducted numerous countrywide
struggles in the 1921--22 and 1930--32 periods; it has a supreme
leader, Gandhi, who has led a number of struggles beginning
with the struggles of the South African Indians, and several
others who have given active leadership to many struggles as
his trusted colleagues. All these were being utilized for bargaining
with the British government. Although the _League_
also is at the bargaining counter --- that is the only similarity
between the two --- but it lacked a programme of struggle
and an outlook as compared to that of the Congress.

There was another difference between the Congress and
the _League_. The Congress was a political party which was
fighting against the British government by rallying under its
own leadership all the left forces inside and outside its organization.
Its leadership would adopt the leftist phraseology
and programmes as and when found necessary for this purpose.
It considered that the fundamental contradiction was
between itself and the British government.

As for the _Muslim League_, its fundamental contradiction
was with the Congress. It was mainly concerned about
the future of that section of the _bourgeoisie_ which it represented
in the event power was transferred to the Congress.
They were trying to establish that in this respect there were
other minority interests also with them. That was why in the
amendment to the Congress resolution in the legislatures, the
_Muslim League_ warned the British government against
giving assurance to the Congress on the Indian constitution
without obtaining the consent of the minority interests.

The British government used this situation in a clever
way. On 1st November --- the day after the date fixed for
the resignation of the Congress ministries --- the Viceroy
invited Gandhi, the Congress President Rajendra Prasad
and the _League_ President Jinnah for a talk. In the meeting
the government proposed to expand the Viceroy's Executive
Council to include immediately the representatives of the
Congress and the _League_. It was also suggested that in
order to pave the way for this, the Congress and the _League_
start negotiation between themselves with a view to reaching
an agreement at the level of provincial administration. This
meant that the Congress and the _League_ should participate
in the existing Executive Council without the government
making the declaration on its war aims and without introducing
any change in the Central administration and that the
Congress and the _League_ should similarly form coalition
governments in the provinces.

The latter part of the proposal was in fact suggested by
the _League_ following the 1937 election and rejected by the
Congress. If it were to be accepted now, it would amount to
an admission of defeat on the part of the Congress. The former
part was also unacceptable to the Congress, because it was
a negation of the policy which was adopted by the Congress
as a compromise between the views of the right and left wings
of the Congress. Following this, there was a war of statements
between the Congress leaders and the government.
Gandhi was forced to issue several statements justifying the
attitude of the Congress to which he was opposed in the
beginning. All this created the impression among the ranks
of the Congress that another round of mass struggle against
the British was inevitable. This impression was strengthened
by the speeches and statements of leaders like Nehru inside
the Congress and by others like Bose outside. On the other
hand, the government utilized the statements made by the
leaders of the _Muslim League_ and other minorities and
interests to reject the claim made by the Congress. As a reply
to this, the Congress repeated the same old argument which
it had presented at the _Round Table Conferences_ earlier
that the problem of the different communities was an internal
problem of the Indian people, which will be resolved by
the Indian people themselves.

Thus, the policy of the Congress reached a blind alley.
It became clear that the aim with which the Congress leadership
decided to relinquish office in the provinces was not
going to realize. The statements issued by the leaders before
and after the resignation of the ministries did not bring about
any change in the attitude of the government.

On the other hand, the grip of the repressive laws was
becoming tight day by day, following the resignation of the
ministries. The situation in the country was becoming worse.
Following the declaration of the war, prices of essential
commodities were shooting up. The people were discontent
at the resulting rise in the cost of living. Trade Unions and
other mass organizations began to demand higher wages in
proportion to the rise in prices. Communist, _Congress Socialists_
and other left-wing _Congressmen_ were in the forefront
of the agitations and struggles of the people in defence of
their demands. Basing on the confidence of the people they
were able to earn through these struggles, the leftists had
been bringing pressure to bear upon the right-wing _Congressmen_
to start a country-wide mass movement.

In this background, the _Congress Working Committee_ was
forced to review the situation and move along the path of
anti-war struggles. At the same time, the leadership was
doubtful if they would be able to control the struggle as
before in the new international and national situations. After
prolonged discussions, it was decided to call a Congress
session at Ramgarh in Bihar in March 1940.

## RAMGARH AND LAHORE

The disputes among the government, the Congress and
the _League_ led finally to two important developments. The
Congress, tired of the British obstinacy, decided at its
Ramgarh session in March 1940 to launch a _satyagraha_
movement. The _League_ adopted the historic 'Pakistan' resolution
at its Lahore conference which was also held in
March 1940. The Lahore resolution which changed the
entire course of Indian history stated:

>It is the considered view of this session of the _All India
Muslim League_ that no constitutional plan would be workable
in this country or be acceptable to the _Mussalmans_
unless it is designed on the following basic principles,
namely, that geographically contiguous units are demarcated
into regions, which should be so constituted with
such territorial readjustment as may be necessary that the
areas in which the Muslims are numerically in majority
as in the northwestern and eastern zones of India should
be grouped to constitute "independent states", in which
the constituent unit shall be autonomous and sovereign.

We shall return later to the agitation launched by the
_Leaguers_ under Jinnah to get India divided into two
independent states in accordance with this resolution and to
the discussions held in this connection. Here we shall deal
briefly with the background of the _League_'s Lahore resolution
and its immediate repercussions in the Indian politics.

As we have noted earlier, ever since the idea of transfer
of power from the British to the Indian hands and the political
movement based on it emerged, there emerged the
Islamic politics in India which was also connected with the
same idea of transfer of power. We have also noted that
under the pressure of the national movement the British
government had been forced to propose one constitutional
change after another. At each such stage, two sets of views
 --- Hindu and Islamic --- had also appeared, which were cleverly
made use of by the British to protect their own interests.
Whenever the Indian national movement against the British
led by the Congress gained in strength, the Islamic politics
also got strengthened in parallel. The amendment introduced
by the _League_ members to the resolution moved by the
Congress in the legislatures on the eve of the resignation the
Congress ministries was the final form of this process. It
must, however, be noted that even at this stage, the reference
was to the future constitution of an undivided India. What
was pointedly stated in the amendment was the decisive role
the _League_ should have in the discussions relating to the
future constitution.

The situation radically changed with Lahore resolution
of the _League_. Now there was no question of an undivided
independent India; India should be divided as she gained
independence. In order to understand the reason behind this
change, it is necessary to look back at the changes that had
taken place in the course of the European war immediately
before the Lahore conference of the _League_ and the _resultant_
changes in the Indian politics as well as in the policies of the
Congress. As we know, the Congress decision to relinquish
office in the provinces came in the midst of bargaining with
the British authorities on the future constitution of India in the
now situation created by the war. The resolution moved by
the Congress in the provincial legislatures was a move in
the pressure politics which was part of the strategy of bargain.
The amendment moved by the _League_ to that resolution
was the Islamic form of the same pressure politics.

When the initial form of this pressure tactics failed and
the Congress felt that it was necessary to strengthen the
pressure tactics in the form of a _satyagraha_ movement, the
_League_ also felt the need to strengthen its own pressure
tactics. The _League_ felt that efforts were being made to
shape the future constitution in a manner visualized by the
Congress through a mass struggle more powerful and wide
spread than those of the 1921--1922 and 1930--1932 periods and
that the defeat in the European war was forcing Britain to
yield to this. Therefore, the 'Pakistan' resolution of the
_League_ was designed to build a base for mass struggle to
face the new situation and to shape the future the way it
visualized.

The Ramgarh session of the Congress was held while
the Islamic politics was moving in that direction. The speech
made by the Chairman of the _Reception Committee_ Rajendra
Prasad, the new president Abul Kalam Azad and Gandhi who
had played a decisive role in the proceedings of the session
were full of exhortations to the masses as well as warning to
the rulers. A consideration of an anti-compromise conference
held immediately before the Ramgarh session would help to
gauge the feelings expressed in these speeches. The anti-compromise
conference was presided over by Subhas Bose who
was under the disciplinary action by the Congress leadership.
Bose and other leftist leaders participating the proceedings of
the conference accused the Congress leadership of trying to
reach a compromise with the British rulers. They reminded
of the leadership's withdrawal of the 1932 struggle on the
pretext of _Harijan Seva_ (service to the depressed castes) and
the subsequent entry in the legislature and called upon the
people to ensure that history was not repeated this time.

The Ramgarh session which was held in this atmosphere
gave a clarion call to the coming struggle of the Indian
people against the war efforts of the British. At the same time,
it imposed severe Gandhian type of restrictions and controls
on the volunteers and issued caution against 'violent tendencies'.
Gandhi made himself clear that he was a leader who was
not at all prepared to give any concession with regard to the
form of struggle and the behaviour of those who were
expected to participate in the struggle. The Congress decided
to launch the struggle under the leadership of such a person
like Gandhi.

The speeches made by Gandhi in the _Subjects Committee_
and in the open session threw light on his own views and on
the nature of the forthcoming struggle. Gandhi made it clear
that the struggle which he was going to lead would not be
the kind of mass struggle which the Communists, _Congress
Socialists_ and other left-wing _Congressmen_ were visualizing.

Warning the delegates that the forthcoming struggle
would be a hard one, Gandhi pointed to two difficulties, "external
difficulties" and "internal difficulties". The former,
according to him, were due to the fact that "the British
Government are engaged in a war and naturally, if we engage
them in a fight, we ask for enough trouble". Regarding the
"internal difficulties", Gandhi said:

>Our Congress registers
are full of bogus members who have swelled them because
they know that getting into the Congress means getting into
power. Those who, therefore, never before thought of
entering the Congress have come into it and corrupted it.[^23/5]

[^23/5]: D. G. Tendulkar, _op. cit_, Vol. 5, p. 260.

Suggesting observation of strict discipline and avoidance
of groups in the Congress, Gandhi continued:

>There is no discipline in our ranks, and they have been
divided up into groups which strive to gain more and
more power. Non-violence as between ourselves does not
seem to us to be necessary. There may be groups, but
then they should strengthen and not weaken and destroy
the organization. Ours has been both a democratic organization,
ever since we reorganized it in 1920. ... I have said
times without number that, if you will be soldiers in my
army, understand that there is no room for democracy in
that organization. The army may be a part of a democratic
organization, but there can be no democracy in it. ...
In an army, the general's word is law, and his condition
cannot be relaxed. I am supposed to be your general, but I
do not know a more feeble general in history. My only
sanction is the love and affection in which you hold me. ... I
know that you love me. Does your love translate itself
into action? If it does not, if it does not mean ever-increasing
discipline and ever-increasing response to what
I say, then let me declare to you that I cannot launch
_civil disobedience_, and you must select another general.
You cannot make me your general on your terms.[^23/6]

[^23/6]: _Ibid_, p. 262.

It may be noted that these are not mere metaphorical
expressions used while comparing the struggle with a battle.
The underlying politics is clear from what he continued to say:

>Compromise is a part and parcel of my nature. I will go to
the Viceroy fifty times, if I feel like it... I could not have
fought the Dutch and the English without love in my heart
for them, and without a readiness for compromise.[^23/7]

[^23/7]: _Ibid_, p. 260.

Here Gandhi was expressing his fundamental disagreement
with the leftist view of waging an uncompromising
struggle until the final victory was achieved, considering Britain's
difficulties as the opportunity for India.

Many delegates both in the _Subjects Committee_ as well
as in the general session criticized the resolution for not
specifically characterizing the struggle a "mass" struggle.
To them Gandhi replied: "Well, if it is not mass _civil disobedience_,
is it to be the _civil disobedience_ of a handful? In
that case I should not have come to you." Continuing,
Gandhi said that every Congress committee should become
a "_satyagraha_ unit". "If it does not become such a unit", he
said, "millions of our dumb countrymen will be sacrificed.
None of my campaigns has crushed or ruined the masses."

Later Gandhi explained what he meant by the proposal
that every Congress committee should become a _satyagraha_
unit."Every Congress committee should become a _satyagraha_
committee and register such _Congressmen_ who believe in the
cultivation of the spirit of goodwill towards all, who have
no untouchability in them in any shape or form, who would
spin regularly, and who habitually use _khadi_ to the exclusion
of all other clothes. I would expect those who thus
register their names with the committees, to devote the whole
of their spare time to the _constructive programme_. If the response
is sincere, these _satyagraha_ committees would become
busy spinning depots."[^23/8] Gandhi explained how these _constructive
programmes_ had to be carried out and how to centralize
these activities.

[^23/8]: _Ibid_, p. 266.

It is clear from the above that except those who got
immersed themselves in the Gandhian _constructive programmes_,
none else would have any role in the struggle to be
launched by the Congress under Gandhi's leadership. Further,
in the midst of such a "mass" struggle, Gandhi would not
miss even a slight opportunity to arrive at a compromise with
the British rulers.

This and the intolerance displayed by Gandhi towards
the existence of the different mutually competing groups
demonstrated the real nature of the political approach of
Gandhi and the right-wing _Congressmen_ led by him. They
were jittery about the different groups based on Communism,
Socialism and other revolutionary ideologies, the growth of
the organized strength of the working class and peasantry
under the influence of these ideologies and the eagerness
shown by the ordinary _Congressmen_ to oppose the compromising
attitude of the right-wing leadership. They were aware
of the possible consequences of launching a struggle without
being cautious of these forces.

However, the _bourgeois_ leadership was confident of
organizing a struggle under their full control by removing
those "obstacles". The leadership was also confident that if
they could carry forward such a struggle, the British rulers
would be forced to relax their rigid attitude. That was the
reason why they adopted a resolution couched in the language
of struggle. And it was for the same reason that Jinnah
and the _Muslim League_ led by him adopted a new approach
suited to protect their own interest by facing the new move
made by the Congress.
