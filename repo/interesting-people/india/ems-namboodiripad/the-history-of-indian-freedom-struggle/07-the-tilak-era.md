# THE TILAK ERA

## "_SWADESHI_" AND "_SWARAJ_"

_World Capitalism_ underwent a basic change towards the
end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th.
_Monopoly Capitalism_ or imperialism came into being during
the time. Wars among the imperialist powers, revolutionary
struggles of various nationalities against imperialism and
struggles for Socialism under the leadership of the working
class within the imperialist countries --- all this became more
widespread and intense, and a new world political situation
came into being with all these characteristics.

It was during this period that parties of the working
class grew in strength in Germany, France, Italy and other
European countries and gained considerable voice in their
respective parliaments. In Britain too, which was relatively
lagging behind other countries in this respect, an independent
party of the working class was formed, and it began to participate
in the elections. It has to be specifically mentioned
here that Engels, during the closing years of his life was
writing articles and letters warmly welcoming these developments
and giving practical guidance to the activists of these
parties.

The waves of these developments swept over the independence
struggle in India, too. When a branch of the _Indian
National Congress_ began to function in England, the activists
of that organization were initially depending on the
Liberal Party; with the formation of the _Labour party_, it
became a mighty sympathizer and advocate of the Indian
independence struggle. The activists of Indian independence
movement also established relation with the working class
Socialist movements in Europe and America.

It is on record that Dadabhoy Naoroji and Madame
Cama participated in two different conferences of the Second
International. Later, Madame Cama and her colleagues
established contacts with various revolutionary groups all
over Europe, when they started organizing revolutionary
groups challenging the leadership of Naoroji and others.
They sought the help and cooperation of the revolutionaries
in France, Germany and Russia for securing arms and
training in their use.

Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the renowned 'extremist' leaders
of India stated: It is beyond doubt that the struggle for
independence in India receive liberal support from the international
forces. The struggles and victories of the working
class of England, the sacrifice made by the revolutionaries
of France and their ultimate victory, the efforts of the
Italians and their victory, the continuous struggles of the
peoples of Russia, Poland, Finland and Hungary, of the
nationalist forces of Europe, inspire and strengthen us.

Apart from these, certain other events of historic significance
also occurred during this period. In 1896, a European
imperialist power, Italy, clashed with Abyssenia (Ethiopia),
an African country, and met with defeat. England had to
undergo a lot of difficulties in the Boer War of 1899--1902.
Revolutionary movements emerged in Asian countries like
China, Persia (Iran) and Turkey. In 1905 a European power,
Russia, was defeated by an Asian power, Japan. Following
this, workers and other toiling people of Russia conducted a
revolution against the Czar's regime. As a part of the revolutionary
nationalist movement in China, a move was afoot to
_boycott_ American goods.

The waves of all these developments swept over India,
too. Even Swami Vivekananda whose activities confined
mainly to spiritual plane, wrote to one of his friends on the
Russo-Japanese war:

>The Japanese seem now to have fully
awakened themselves to the necessity of the present times. ...
Come, be men! Come out of your narrow holes and have a
look abroad. See how nations are on the march. Do you
love men? Do you love your country? Then come, let us struggle
for higher and better things; look not back, no, not even
if you see the dearest and nearest cry. Look not back, but
forward.[^07/1]

[^07/1]: _Letters of Swami Vivekananda_, Advaita Ashrama, Calcutta, (1964 Edition),
pp. 43--44.

This new enthusiasm found expression in the _Indian
National Congress_, too. The Congress, formed with the
'moderate' objective of working for limited administrative
reform through petitions to the British officials in India and
to the rulers in Britain, began to change itself into a fighting
organization with more radical objective and adopting more
intensive agitational forms of struggle. An intense conflict
between the 'extremist' Congress leaders who were trying to
bring about this transformation and those who wanted to
maintain the Congress as a body for submitting petitions.

This conflict led to a split in Congress, which we shall
examine later along with the circumstances that led to the
split. Here we will deal only with the changes that occurred
in the economy of the country which gave rise to these developments.

The British, as we know, first come to India as traders
selling goods produced in their country and taking Indian
goods to their country. It was the East India Company which
obtained first the Charter from the British Crown for
carrying on the trade and subsequently obtained from the
Emperor of Delhi and the provincial rulers the administrative
rights to safeguard their interests.

When the administration gradually extended to cover
the entire country, the Company realised that it was not
enough for them to confine their activities to commercial
transactions and that they must also engage themselves in
agricultural and industrial production. Accordingly, they
entered the fields of modern capitalist plantation, primary
industries for processing raw materials and the railways and
transportation network building essential for these activities.

Since the Company's administration was not helpful in
all these activities, the administration was gradually brought
under the control of the British government. Finally, the
administrative powers were fully transferred to the government.
Following this, the nature of the British rule once
again underwent a change towards the end of the 19th
century and the beginning of the 20th century.

As we know, the main characteristic of _monopoly
Capitalism_ or imperialism is the export of capital. So, the
British monopoly capitalists were not satisfied merely with
the availability of cheap raw materials for the British industries
or high prices obtained for the British industrial goods.
They must also use India for investing part of their profits
in England as capital in order to earn more profits. They
knew that investment in India where cheap labour and raw
materials were available would enable them to earn higher
rates of profit. Consequently, they formulated and pursued
such policies as would serve these purposes.

As an inevitable consequence of this, the British were
perforce led to introduce limited industrialization and the
_resultant_ social transformations in India. At the same time
they would not do anything which would endanger their
domination over India. For, they knew that if industrialization
were to take place in India as independently and
rapidly as it occurred in England, it would result in the
emergence and development of an independent _bourgeoisie_
in India challenging their domination over the country.
Therefore, they took all precautions to ensure that no
indigenous industry, except those under their direct control
and ownership, developed in India. With this aim in view,
they took a number of steps including the imposition of
export and import duties and fixation of railway and shipping
freight tariffs in a manner detrimental to the interests of
indigenous industrialists. They also utilized their administrative
power to control the production and prices of industrial
raw materials in which they had invested capital. In short,
they exerted their control over the administration for the
purpose of preventing the free development of _Capitalism_ in
the country.

However, as pointed out earlier, a capitalist class
which was capable of challenging the power to an extent
developed rapidly, though under the shadow of the British
rulers. In fact, Indian economists like Naoroji and Ranade
were the spokesmen of this class. The _Indian National
Congress_ was formed subsequently by them and other sections
of the _bourgeoisie_.

Thus, when both the British monopolists and Indian
capitalists invested their capital in industries in India, their
respective interests came to conflict with each other. It came
to manifest itself in clear terms in the beginning of the 20th
century. The capital invested in India by companies registered
in England during the period of the Russo-Japanese war
and the upsurge of the freedom fighters inspired by the
outcome of that war, was 96.7 million pound sterling, which
was thrice the total investment of capital by all the companies
registered in India. This shows that the companies registered
in England enjoyed a dominant position in India. Moreover,
a considerable number of industries registered in India were
either owned or controlled by the British.

However, the number of industries registered in India
and the volume of capital invested were rapidly increasing.
Between 1897 and 1906, the capital invested by companies
registered in India increased by 36.8 percent. In certain
sectors of industry, including the textile industry in Bombay,
Indian capitalists had predominance. The British had sought
to control some of these industries directly by means of
managing agency system and indirectly through governmental
policies. It was done with the clear objective of preventing
the development of _Indian Capitalism_. The _resultant_ conflicts
led to the slogan of _Swadeshi_ and triggered a socio-political
movement based on it. The Indian capitalists realized that
just as the British capitalists exert influence on their government
for the protection of their own interest, so there was a
need for them to influence the rulers both in Britain
and in India to protect their own interests. But this was of
no avail, because the British government was biased towards
the British capitalists whenever there was a conflict between
the interests of the British and Indian capitalists. So, the
latter came to realize further that it was necessary for them
to adopt agitational path, rather than depending on petitions
and representations. The leaders of the independence struggle
suggested the people of India come forward to safeguard the
interests of Indian capitalists in the same way as the government
came forward to protect the interests of the British
capitalists against the interests of the Indian capitalists.

The situation got aggravated in 1905. _Swadeshi_ at that
time was the symbol of 'extremist' politics, which had been
developing as a socio-economic movement over the past
quarter of a century. From 1880, voices of protest were being
raised in Western India against the crisis of Indian industries.
Even at that time, _Swadeshi_ had become a slogan symbolizing
patriotism. This is evident from the fact the new textile mill
established by Jamshedji Tata in 1885 was named the "_Swadeshi_
Mill". Mass organizations like the Sarvajanik Sabha of
Poona adopted _Swadeshi_ as the sole means to liberate India.

The _Swadeshi_ movement which, till then, was confined
mainly to the socio-economic sphere, acquired political significance
with the new political advance started in 1905. At
that time, along with the "constructive" approach of encouragement
to indigenous industries, it also included the
"agitational" content of _boycott_ of foreign goods. Just as
the slogan of _Swadeshi_ in the socio-economic sphere, so the
slogan of _Swaraj_ also came to be raised in the political sphere
during the same time. An agitational significance to this
slogan was provided by Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar
Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal, popularly known as the "LalBal-Pal"
triumvirate. It was they who placed before the
people a programme of action comprising _Swadeshi_, _boycott_
of British goods, and a national education policy, and strove
to get this programme adopted by the Congress. It was
again they who openly stated that the aim of the freedom
fighters was not _administrative reforms_, as demanded by the
Congress earlier, but an administrative system in which Indians
have as much share as the Englishmen have in England.
Interestingly, these slogans were adopted by 'moderates' also.
For instance, Dadabhoy Naoroji, a 'moderate' leader, raised
this slogan in his speech delivered as the President of the
Calcutta session of the Congress in 1906. A resolution adopted
by that conference also accepted the _Swadeshi_ and other
slogans of the 'extremists'.

As we shall see in the following chapters, this represented
only one stage in the conflict between the 'moderates' and
'extremists' in the Congress. The Calcutta session, in fact,
helped not to bring about a unity between these two sections,
but to prepare the ground for further conflicts. However,
the adoption by the 'moderate'-led Congress of the two slogans,
_Swadeshi_ and _Swaraj_, which had hitherto been identified
with the programme of the 'extremists' was a significant
development in the history of the _freedom struggle_.

The conflict between the British rulers and the Indian
_bourgeoisie_ had now become sharper than ever before. The
Congress, which emerged as the mouthpiece of the Indian
_bourgeoisie_ and the freedom movement under its leadership,
had reached a turning point. In order words, the movement
for independence had now passed from the stage of infancy
and entered the stage of adolescence.

## MASSES ON THE POLITICAL SCENE

As we had noticed earlier, the inspiration for the new
_anti-imperialist_ upsurge was the conflict between the rising
capitalist class in India and the British capitalists who were
tightening their grip over the Indian economy. This was,
however, not the only element that inspired the movement
that emerged during this period. Another element of equal or
more significance was the conflict between the upper classes
and the common people.

With the growth of the British and the Indian capitalists,
a working class had also begun to emerge. In the early stage
of the growth of _Capitalism_, workers in India, as elsewhere
in the world, had to toil hard under conditions of extremely
cruel exploitation. During the early years of the 20th century,
for instance, the working time in the factories was, on the
average, 12 hours and 7 minutes per day. In some factories,
it was even 14 hours. In Bombay, workers had to toil for
over 12 hours in some factories which had started using
electric power it was between 14.5 and 15 hours). In Broach
it was 14.5 hours, in Agra 13.75 to 15.5 hours, in Lucknow 13.75
hours, in Sholapur, 12.5 hours to 13.5 hours, in Delhi 13.5, to 14.5 hours and in Amritsar and Lahore, it was 13 to 13.75 hours.
(The figures are from the data published officially by the
Factory Labour Commission.)

This, along with low wage levels, burden of debts and
dependence on contractors and middlemen, led to discontent
among the workers and to disturbances. Often they were
forced to resort to strikes.

Details of strikes that burst out in Bombay and Ahmedabad,
though not in an organized way, were given in the
Commission's report cited above. The Commission's report
also gives instances of wage increase and other demands of
the employees in Bombay and Ahmedabad. The employers
were forced to concede to the strikes in places like Agra and
Madras.

In many such cases, the workers had to face the Indian
capitalists who were being supported by the British capitalists,
administrators, and the British Press. Thus, while clashes
were taking place between the Indian and British capitalists,
on the other side, clashes were also taking place between the
Indian capitalists and workers.

In the agricultural sector, too, class conflicts were getting
intensified day by day. The practice of investing capital in
the agricultural sector had become universal as a natural
consequence of the development of _Capitalism_. But, this
investment of capital did not serve to modernize agriculture,
as it did in Europe, because modernization in the industrial
sector that was required for the modernization of agriculture
using machinery and new technologies was not there. On
the other hand, the rulers made conscious efforts not to bring
about such a modernization.

Capital was used for the purpose of purchasing ownership
rights on land. It became the practice of the rich to
give loans at high interest rates to the small and middle
peasants and force them to sell their land in the event of
failure to repay the loans. As a result, the new rich became
landowners; on the other side, the small and middle peasants
became landless. Thus, while the contradiction between the
feudal landlords and their tenants continued, there began
another contradiction between the new rich trying to secure
ownership of land and the farmers who were deprived of
their land. Both contradictions were getting sharpened day
by day.

Further, caste-domination, related to land owned by the
feudal lords, but more deep-rooted than feudal domination
itself, the declining rural industries, absence of land reform
or industrialization required to provide employment to those
who were formerly engaged in rural industries and the consequent
growing unemployment --- all these made the life of the
rural people more and more miserable. The tax system introduced
by the British and the cruel way of collecting taxes led
to the pauperization of the majority of the rural people.
Famines, epidemics and deaths became common. Instead of
trying to solve these problems, the government continued to
function in a most inhuman way.

And a new generation of leadership had also started
coming up from among the educated sections of the people.
Teachers,lawyers, journalists and various other salary-earning
sections of people and students were increasing in number.
As noted earlier, the influence of the world revolutionary advance
had spread among them. The arrogance of the British
bureaucrats was hurting the self-respect of the people. Books
and journals giving details of the exploitation and oppression
by the British capitalists and high officials roused their ire.
The inspiration for self-sacrifice in the fight for independence
and democracy gave them a new life.

These were what lay beneath the emergence of radical
politics. The forces behind the 'extremist' political movement
that emerged under the leadership of the Bal-Pal-Lal triumvirate
were the middle and poor sections of the people in
the urban and rural areas. This was what differentiated the
new generation of 'extremist' political leaders from the
leadership of the Congress in the earlier period.

Lok Manya Tilak was the most eminent among the
'extremist' leaders --- the foremost among the earlier generation
of national leaders who laid down everything for the service
of the country. The heroic struggles he carried on consistently
against the rulers made him the target of their hatred.
He was respected and held in high regard even by foreign
intellectuals for his scholarship and deep learning, but to the
power drunk bureaucrats he was an anathema. On more than
one occasion he had to undergo the extreme rigours of the
prison life which wrecked his health. But he was able to
achieve what none of the previous generation of leaders
could achieve: He became the most respected leader of the
poor and middle class people in the rural and urban areas.

Even at the beginning of his political life, Tilak
manifested the characteristics of the new generation which
he represented. Wielder of a sharp pen, Tilak started two
journals, _Kesari_ in his mother tongue Marathi, and _Mahratta_
in English. He utilized the columns of these journals to expose
the misrule of the bureaucrats and to advocate the cause
of India's independence. Even in the early days of these
journals, Tilak and his colleague Agarkar were convicted for
publishing articles exposing the misdeeds of the _Dewan_ of
the _Princely State_ of Baroda in the name of the _Maharaja_ of
that state. (In the history of modern nationalist movement,
journalists undergoing punishment was not common.) Public
contribution for the conduct of the case and the enthusiastic
reception accorded by the people to Tilak and Agarkar as
they came out of jail on completion of their term of imprisonment
were almost the first instance of such events in the
political life of India. This was an experience which eminents
like Ranade, Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta and Gokhale
could not even dream of.

This occurred in 1882, before the formation of the _Indian
National Congress_. The selfless work in the service of the
country that Tilak carried on for nearly four decades since
then has gone down not only in his life but also in the annals
of the Indian history.

During the 1896--97 famine in Maharashtra, when the
administration was callously eager to collect taxes from the
famine stricken people, Tilak openly opposed and exposed
the unlawful acts of the rulers by citing the regulations
governing famine affected areas. He called upon the people
to resist the unlawful tax collection in an organized manner.
"If you have money, pay the tax, but you are not liable to
pay the tax by selling your cattle, land and other properties",
he advised the common people in the rural areas.

Before long, another distress overlook the people of
Maharashtra when the epidemic of plague spread all over the
region. The Government took measures to provide treatment
to those afflicted by the disease and to ensure that it did not
spread. But the authorities who had no relations with the
people assigned the relief work to the police and military,
The latter, on the other hand, organized the 'epidemic relief
work' in a manner in which they, without any human consideration,
entered homes and harassed women and children.
Strongly opposing this, Tilak fearlessly exposed the misdeeds
of the bureaucrats. He openly declared that the people had
the right to take defensive actions against those who entered
their homes and behaved discourteously.

This was the reason for his second term of imprisonment.
He was charged with "instigating the people to violence".
The prosecution argued that Tilak was the force behind the
murder of two officials, one an Englishman, who had earned
notoriety for their misdeeds in the relief activities in the
plague-affected areas. The judge who tried that case recorded
that Tilak had no part in the murder. Yet he was convicted.
The judge decreed that the very political activities of Tilak
who had no loyalty and affection for the British rulers were
punishable.

These two incidents in the life of Tilak revealed the close
links the 'extremist' leaders of the new generation had with
the masses. At that time, there was no organized trade union
or peasant movement. But the movement that developed under
the leadership of the Bal-Pal-Lal triumvirate drew the masses,
including industrial workers and the peasants, into the political
arena. The 'extremists' formulated a programme of action
which included _Swadeshi_, _Swaraj_, national education and resistance
lo oppression by the bureaucrats and exploiters.
Industrial workers, peasants and other poor sections of the
people in towns and villages were inspired. Gradually the
working class started using the weapon of strike, their
struggles went beyond the limits of struggles for wage rise
and reduced working hours and other immediate economic
demands; they took the form of political strikes.

The first political strike in the history of India took
place when Tilak was sentenced to imprisonment for the
third time in 1908. Now the strike was on a common political
issue. As Lenin stated, this was an "open declaration of the
maturity of working class in India". Tilak's conviction also
gave a new form of struggle, _hartal_, which later came to
occupy an important place in the _freedom struggle_. On the
day of delivery of the judgement people had collected in the
court in large numbers. To avoid them, Tilak was whisked
away by the backdoor. The people protested against this
in strong terms. Shops and markets were closed, students
boycotted classes and wore black badges. Workers, students
and traders acted in unison to express their strong protest.
The people of Bengal had already developed this method of
struggle in connection with the partition of Bengal. Its
adoption in Maharashtra, to demonstrate people's respect and
affection for Tilak, gave the movement an all-India character.

The role Tilak and his colleagues played in giving shape
to the people's protest has rightly been placed high. Justifiably,
these leaders earned the love and respect of historians
as well as of the masses. There is one thing, no less important
than the courage and sense of self-sacrifice these leaders
displayed, which needs special mention here. People had
risen with a class consciousness and with the strength of
organized action. The greatness of these leaders lay in the
fact that they were able to gauge this force and give an
organized form to it. And it was this fact which distinguished
them from the leaders of the earlier generation.

## THE "DIVIDE AND RULE" TACTICS AND SETBACKS

We have noticed that the Congress which was formed
with the blessings and help of a section of British bureaucracy
and purely on the basis of 'moderate' programmes, declaring
loyalty to the British, faced opposition and Vindictive actions
from the authorities before long. Over the years, this
opposition and vindictive actions became stronger. The
formation of an 'extremist' section under the leadership of
Tilak and others and the adoption by the Congress, as a
consequence of the activities of this section, of the programme
of _Swadeshi_ and _Swaraj_ added fuel to the fire of this opposition
and vindictiveness.

The very first method used by the rulers to nip in the
bud the movement that was developing into a threat to their
domination was to subject individual leaders of the movement
to repression. Even before the formation of the _Indian
National Congress_, Surendranath Banerji in Bengal and Tilak
in Maharashtra had to undergo imprisonment. With the
emergence of the Congress organization and the rise of
'extremist' tendencies, the repression became more severe.

Since, however, the rulers found that the movement was
not showing any signs of weakness even under these
repressive measures, but, on the other hand, was steadily
advancing, they sought to use other means to suppress it. As
part of this strategy, Lord Curzon, the then Governor-General,
formulated and implemented a plan to partition Bengal.

At that time, the Province of Bengal was a source of
strength and inspiration for the independence movement in
general and for 'extremist' tendencies in particular. It was a
movement that had taken roots equally in the city of Calcutta
and in the eastern districts of Bengal. The Congress
leaders in general, and the 'extremist' sections within the
Congress in particular, were able to organize the Bengali-speaking population of this area, as they were successful in
organizing the Marathi-speaking people in Bombay, as an
integral part of the national movement. The partition of
Bengal was a political device to break the unity which had
grown out of this movement. The authorities used the ploy
of "administrative convenience" to justify the partition. But
there was enough evidence to show that the real motive was
political. Three Bengali-speaking districts were part of
Assam. The Province of Bengal at that time consisted of the
rest of the Bengali-speaking districts, Bihar, Orissa and
Chota Nagpur. The argument justifying the partition was that
since the province comprised a vast area, it was necessary
to partition it in the interest of administrative efficiency.

The notes and letters of Governor-General Curzon and
various other high officials, however, showed that the real
reason for the partition was something else. Those who
stood in the forefront of the political agitation not only in
Bengal but all over India were the educated middle class (the
_Baboos_) who were, through their writings in Bengali newspapers
and their speeches, turning the masses against the British
rulers. The advance of the movement could be effectively
checked only if facilities for such activities were denied to
them. In the words of Curzon:

>The Bengalis who like to
think themselves a nation, and who dream of a future when
the British will have been turned out and a _Bengali Babu_ will
be installed in Government House, Calcutta, of course bitterly
resent any disruption that will be likely to interfere with
the realization of this dream. If we are weak enough to
yield to their clamour now we shall not be able to dismember
or reduce Bengal again, and you will be cementing and solidifying
in the eastern flank of India a force already formidable
and certain to be a source of increasing trouble in the future.[^07/3]

[^07/3]: Curzon Papers, Curzon to Brodrick, 17 February, 1904, cited in
Tara Chand, _Ibid_, Volume III, p. 311.

If the intention was to reduce the size of the province
solely in view of administrative efficiency, then this could
have been accomplished by removing Hindi and Oriya-speaking
areas and the tribal territories from Bengal and by
adding to it the Bengali-speaking areas of Assam. Instead,
the plan was to create a new province comprising the districts
of eastern Bengal and Assam and to retain the Hindi and
Oriya-speaking areas and tribal territories in Bengal as before.

The consequence of this was not only the break-up of a
linguistic group; it also led to the intensification of the linguistic
contradictions and quarrels between the two states, one
comprising Bengali and Assamiya speaking areas and tribal
territories and the other comprising Bengali, Hindi and
Oriya-speaking areas and tribal territories. Further, because
Dacca[^dhaka] was the capital of the new province of East Bengal
and because the majority of the population of that region
were Muslims, the partition plan would help create the impression
of liberating the Muslim population from the Hindu
domination of the undivided Bengal.

[^dhaka]: Dhaka, formerly known as Dacca, is the current capital  of Bangladesh & was divided out of the Province of Bengal.

Thus, the plan to partition Bengal helped the rulers to
disrupt the unity of the Bengali people and to sow the seeds
of Hindu-Muslim conflict in the entire population of India,
thereby dividing and weakening the _anti-imperialist_ forces.

The result was, however, different. Voices of protest
began to rise high throughout Bengal even as the news of
partition began to come in. State-wide meetings and demonstrations
in which hundreds and thousands of people
participated were staged. There were even meetings in which
as many as 50,000 people participated. Students, lawyers,
employees and others came out on the streets donning
black badges in token of sorrow. Mass protests were
registered in various forms like strikes, _boycott_ of classes and
_hartals_.

These were not confined to Bengal alone. Political
activists in the other provinces also came out to express their
solidarity with their brethren in Bengal who were under such
a cruel attack. Resolutions demanding the repeal of partition
of Bengal were passed by the _Indian National Congress_ and
all other political-social organizations.

It was as an integral part of this agitation that _boycott_
form of struggle which was advocated earlier by the
'extremists', came to be practised throughout the country.
Before this, the programme of _boycott_ of foreign goods had
been carried out in certain places, but without political
motives. Now, it was accepted as a form of political struggle.

Even before the official notification relating to the partition
appeared in the press in India on 6th July 1905, an
opinion had been expressed that a _boycott_ action should be
carried out to express protest against the proposed partition.
The programme was, however, given an organized shape only
on 7th August by the decision taken at a convention held in
the Calcutta Town Hall. This convention was preceded by
a mammoth demonstration in which students and youth who
had already taken a pledge of _boycott_ at various local
meetings and thousands of others who had not yet taken such
a pledge, participated.

As indicated earlier, it was not simply a _boycott_ of
foreign goods. The boycott action spread to various sectors
and took various forms. For example, shoemakers refused
to repair the shoes of Englishmen; cooks and domestic servants
from Orissa refused to serve masters who used foreign
goods; washermen took a pledge that they would not wash
foreign clothes; priests declared that they would not conduct
marriage ceremonies where foreign cloth was used. Thus,
various sections of people implemented the programme of
_boycott_ in their respective spheres.

Though this agitational programme was carried out more
strongly in Bengal, its waves swept over other regions of the
country as well. The anti-partition agitation and the _boycott_
programme which was a part of it helped the 'extremist'
section which had come forward with a new militant programme
of _Swadeshi_, _Swaraj_ and national education to win
the acclaim of the Congress ranks and of the people of the
country as a whole. It was as a sequel to the sweeping
waves of this agitation that Dadabhoy Naoroji, who presided
over the Congress session at Calcutta in 1906, came out with
the declaration that _Swaraj_ was the goal of the people of
India.

This session also justified the _boycott_ movement
launched in Bengal to protest against partition and declared
that it would be continued. Even 'moderate' leaders like
Madan Mohan Malaviya, Gopal Krishna Gokhale and others
raised voice in protest against partition and justified the
boycott agitation that was being carried on in Bengal. It
was in this background that resolutions were passed at the
session on issues like _Swadeshi_, national education, etc., and
on the need for extending to India the form of government
similar to that existed in the self-governing colonies of Britain.

Thus, the plan for partitioning Bengal, designed to create
a split in the nationalist movement, really helped to develop
national unity based on an 'extremist' programme. The
agitations and _boycott_ of foreign goods, which started merely
as an expression of sympathy towards the brethren of Bengal
became an integral part of the all-India political movement
for _Swaraj_. The situation developed in such a way that even the
stark 'moderates' came to realize that they could not function
without giving due consideration to the intense _anti-imperialist_
feelings of the people.

This revolutionary upsurge, however, had its own
weaknesses. The movement was constrained by two limitations
which enabled the rulers to create a split in the _anti-imperialist_
feelings of the people, which rose first during the partition
days in Bengal and later spread throughout India and got
reflected in the 1906 Congress session.

_First_, although the Calcutta session adopted almost all
the slogans including _Swadeshi_, _Boycott_, and _Swaraj_, which
the 'extremist' section had raised, the leadership of the
organization remained with the 'moderates'. What happened
at the Calcutta session was only a temporary compromise
between the 'moderate' leaders like Pherozeshah Mehta,
Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Rash Behari Gosh and Surendranath
Banerji, on the one side, and the 'extremist' leaders like Tilak,
Bipin Chandra Pal and Lala Lajpat Rai, on the other. As
the circumstance which compelled the 'moderates' to reach a
compromise with the 'extremists', (_i.e._, the atmosphere of the
mass upsurge following the partition of Bengal) began to
change, the former came to the fore once again. This, in
fact, formed the background of the controversies at the
Surat session of the Congress and the split that followed.

_Second_, the Hindu outlook of the nationalist leaders
including the 'extremists' and the Islamic outlook of the new
generation of political workers who were emerging from
among the Muslims, gave rise to misgivings and lack of confidence
between the two communities. This weakness, which
later on affected Indian politics as a whole, was cleverly
utilized by Curzon and his successors in the partition of
Bengal. The rulers deliberately tried to create the feeling
among the Muslim elites that they would be able to establish
their domination in the new province which included Muslim
majority areas. And this was successful to a large extent.
The _Nawab_ of Dacca and other elitist leaders who had earlier
participated in the anti-partition agitation subsequently
turned out in favour of partition. The Muslim elitist
leaders also got the inspiration from the rulers to raise new
demands concerning the rights and privileges they must have
in Indian politics and to form a new organization, the _Muslim
League_.

In spite of the existence of two conflicting groups in the
Congress and of the conflict between the Congress and the
_League_ engineered by the rulers, the Government had to
revoke the partition and re-unite Bengal into one province in 1911. In other words, the British rulers came to realize that
the mass sentiment expressed in the anti-partition agitations
was just and irrepressible.

## SPLIT IN CONGRESS

Dadabhoy Naoroji's presidential address and the resolution
passed at the 1906 session of the Congress at Calcutta
inspired millions of Indian people. But the session angered
the British rulers. They had anticipated that the growing
conflicts between the 'moderate' and the 'extremists' would
weaken the Congress organization and that it would finally
split at the Calcutta session. But that did not happen.
Instead, both 'moderates' and 'extremists' declared unitedly
that the aim of the Congress was _Swaraj_. The Calcutta
session prepared the ground for an agitation including the
programme of _boycott_ which was declared just and reasonable,
even though its purpose was limited to opposing the
partition of Bengal.

The disillusionment and ire of the rulers over this
development found expression in the 'Times':

> The split
between the 'moderates' and the 'extremists' who are the
avowed enemies of the British rule, which seemed imminent
has now been obviated. But the price that the 'moderates' had
to pay for such a development was that they had themselves
to accept the 'extremist' policy to a very large extent.

It became clear to the rulers that this unity based on
agitational programmes must be broken at any cost. The
"Times", which entertained the hope that the best way to
disrupt this unity was to isolate the 'moderate' leadership by
means of threats and pressure, stated:

>The statement made
by the President in his address, opposing the partition of
Bengal, was endorsed by the session in the form of a resolution.
The convention also declared that '_boycott_' was a
just form of agitation. The courts may, however, differ from
this declaration.

It is quite evident that this was a clear warning that in
case the Congress went ahead with the programme of agitation
in accordance with the decisions of the 1906 Calcutta
session, the organization would have to face dangerous consequences.

Even without such a warning from the rulers, the leaders
of the 'moderate' section had already begun to feel that it was
essential to arrest the advance of the 'extremists'. They came
to realize that the millions who had rallied behind leaders
like Tilak and the new generation of activists who responded
to their call were raising the Congress from an organization
of petitioners and supplicants into a fighting body. They
feared that if this move was not checked, they would lose
their hold over the organization and that it would pass into the
hands of the 'extremists'.

Even at the Calcutta session of 1906, the opinion was
in favour of Tilak presiding over the session. Even the arch
'moderates' could not oppose the proposal under the political
atmosphere created by the life of Tilak based on sacrifice
and the role he played in the adoption of _anti-British_
agitational programmes. At the same time, Naoroji was
respected by the 'extremists' because of the role he had played
in exposing the exploitation and other anti-people policies
and measures of the British rulers. Tilak withdrew his candidature
as he felt that it would not be proper for him and
Naoroji to contest for the presidentship.

Since the Calcutta session adopted _Swaraj_ as the objective
and the agitational programme, including _boycott_, to achieve
it, it was felt that a new leadership capable of implementing
the programmes was necessary. Efforts to have Tilak preside
over the next (1907) session were on. The 'moderates' opposed
this move as before. On the other side, the 'extremists' also
started making organized efforts for a change in the leadership.
Even as preparations for the Congress session started,
conflicts were expected on the election of the president and
on other items on the agenda.

It was decided at the Calcutta session that the next
session would be held at Nagpur. The prevailing practice was
for the _Reception Committee_ to select the president. Therefore,
there was a keen competition between the two camps in
enlisting members to the _Reception Committee_. Though
'extremists' were relatively strong in Nagpur, they did not have
the three-fourths majority in the _Reception Committee_ required
to elect the president. Thus, the functioning of the
_Reception Committee_ including presidential election, came to
a standstill. It was in these circumstances that the 'moderate'
leaders of Bombay decided to shift the venue of the session
from Nagpur to Surat which was their strong hold.

Tilak withdrew his candidature because he felt that in
the atmosphere of conflicts it would not be helpful if he
offered himself as a candidate. Instead, Tilak proposed the
name of Lala Lajpat Rai who had by then returned to the
country from Rangoon where he was exiled by the British
government.

Lalaji was also an 'extremist' like Tilak. That was why he
was subjected to repression by the government. In the
circumstances, the proposal to make him the president frightened
the 'moderate' leaders. In fact, Gokhale opposed this
proposal on the plea that in case the government was
unnecessarily annoyed, it could suppress the organization in
a moment.

Ultimately, the 'moderates' decided to put up Rash Behari
Ghosh as their candidate for the presidentship. It was widely
known that Ghosh would unleash a sharp attack on the 'extremists'
in his presidential address. Besides, thoroughly diluted
versions of the various resolutions adopted at the Calcutta
session were being made in the camp of the 'moderates'. On
the other hand, the 'extremists' were determined to repeat
once again the resolutions adopted at the Calcutta session.
Thus, every one thought that Surat would witness a keen
conflict between the two camps.

On behalf of the 'extremists', Tilak had, at the very
outset, made one point clear: "They had no desire to see a
split in the Congress, because they had nothing to gain from
a split." They were, however, firm on the point that the
Congress should firmly adhere to the resolutions adopted at
the Calcutta session; they would stoutly oppose any attempt
to dilute them.

The _Reception Committee_ of the Surat session under
the leadership of the 'moderates' laid all kinds of obstructions
before the 'extremists'. It was a practice to organize reception
to prominent Congress leaders during the session. The
_Reception Committee_ did not organize such receptions
to Tilak, Lajpat Rai and other 'extremist' leaders. But this
did not affect them. It was revealed clearly that the
masses were not with the 'moderates'. For, at a reception
organized by the 'extremists', vast masses participated. This
incident remained an instance of pettiness on the part of
official leadership of the _Reception Committee_.

Although the _Reception Committee_ could not prevent
the people of Surat from declaring support to the 'extremist'
leaders, the 'moderate' leadership succeeded in defeating the
radicals at the conference. The 'extremists' desired to preserve
the unity of the Congress at the same time, while standing
firm on the policies and programmes adopted at the Calcutta
session. In his address at the reception accorded to him,
Tilak, in fact, made this point clear.

As was made clear by Tilak himself and by Lajpat Rai,
what they considered more important was the policies and
programmes of the Congress, rather than who should preside
over the session. They made clear through dialogues
and writings their readiness to withdraw from the contest
for presidentship, if only the Congress adhered to the
decisions of the Calcutta session. If, on the contrary, there
was any departure, they would express their opposition,
including in the election of the president.

But the 'moderate' leaders had already taken a decision
to go back from the Calcutta decision and therefore, were
not prepared to arrive at a compromise with the 'extremist'
leaders. Efforts made by Tilak and other leaders for direct
negotiations yielded no result.

The office bearers were not prepared even to distribute
the draft resolutions in accordance with the practice usually
followed in conferences. They shrugged off the responsibility
on the lame excuse that there were no facilities for getting
the drafts of the resolutions printed. Further, they proposed
a constitution with several conditions which were not at all
acceptable to the 'extremist' section of the organization.

It was in this background that the Surat session started.
After the welcome address, with the announcement of Rash
Behari Ghosh's candidature for the presidentship, the session
became noisy. The reason for the confusion was the
refusal of the 'moderates' to adhere to the resolution passed
at the Calcutta conference as a condition put forward by the
'extremists' for avoiding contest for the presidentship. Because
of the confusion that prevailed, the day's session had to be
suspended. Throughout the day, efforts were made by the
'extremist' leaders to negotiate a settlement, but the 'moderate'
leaders were unbending. So, the next day's session started
in a tense atmosphere. The 'extremist' leaders knew that
they would have to fight out issue by issue.

Tilak demanded in writing that he be given an opportunity
to speak on the issue of presidentship soon after the
names of the presidential candidates were announced.
Simultaneously, he also requested that he be called to speak,
since he had a positive proposal that would help conduct
the proceedings of the conference in a cordial atmosphere.

This was the final effort made by Tilak to ensure the
smooth conduct of the proceedings by resolving the differences
amicably. But, the 'moderate' leaders were not prepared
to recognize the spirit of Tilak's conciliation. They rejected
his request for being called to speak.

But Tilak felt that he must speak with or without
permission, and so he mounted the dais and began to speak.
This was the beginning of a confrontation between his followers
and opponents. Charges and counter-charges were made
against each other; one section charged that Tilak was
forcibly ejected from the dais and the other section charged
that the followers of Tilak had rushed to the dais armed with
sticks. Meanwhile, slippers fell on the 'moderate' leaders
Pherozeshah Mehta and Surendranath Banerji. With this the
conference was adjourned.

The 'extremist' leaders continued their efforts at conciliation
even after these incidents. Following discussions with
those who were acting as mediators, Tilak wrote a letter to
them:

>In regard to the matter discussed by us today, taking
into consideration the best interests of the Congress, my party
and myself are prepared to withdraw our objection to the
election of Rash Behari Ghosh as the President of the twenty-eighth
session of the _Indian National Congress_, to forget
and forgive the past and to work together in future subject
to the following conditions. _Firstly_, a resolution should be
adopted in respect of each of the issues like _Swaraj_, _Swadeshi_
and _Boycott_, clearly declaring that we stand firm on the
resolutions passed last year. _Secondly_, in case there is any
reference against our party in the Presidential address of
Dr. Ghosh, it should be given up.

The 'moderates' were not at all interested in reconciliation.
They held a separate meeting of those who favoured them
and adopted resolutions and a new constitution for the
Congress.

The new provision which they incorporated in the
constitution was designed to prohibit all agitational programmes,
including _boycott_. They thought that since the
radicals would not accept this provision, it could be used to
expel any Congressman from the organization if he started
working with a radical perspective.

And this was exactly what happened. The 'moderates'
and the 'extremists' who functioned in two different camps
within the same organization became two parties and the
'moderates' started using the name of "Indian National
Congress". Subsequently, the Congress and other parties had
split more than once and on many such occasions. Physical
fights, including hurling of slippers, had taken place, as it
happened in the Surat session of the Congress. Also, fierce
controversies had risen over the responsibility of this or that
faction for the split. As in the case of these splits, in the
present split also what used to be made the point of controversy
was the legality of actions of groups and individuals in
incidents that led to the split. But the real issue is not the
legality of this or that action, but the policies and approaches
that led to the disruption of unity. Why did such a situation
arise in the Congress in 1907?

There was a powerful section within the leadership of the
Congress which wanted a change in the futile policies pursued
by the Congress for about two decades. Behind them were
millions of people belonging to all sections and strata of the
population. There was another section in the leadership which,
frightened by these developments, wanted to prevent it at
all cost. The situation had now reached a level where it was
impossible for both the sections to co-exist within the organization.
What happened in Surat was just an explosion of this
situation.

Here it must be stressed that the 'extremists' throughout
worked in a conciliatory manner. They knew that if the Congress
remained a single united organization, the people would
support their programme. On the contrary, the 'moderates'
thwarted all attempts at reconciliation, They knew that a
conciliatory attitude towards the 'extremists' would endanger
their future. In sum, the threat issued by the British rulers
through the "Times" soon after the Calcutta session had its
effect.

## THE CULT OF THE BOMB

The split that occurred in the Congress at Surat gave
green signal to the rulers to unleash a fresh wave of repression.
The victims of this repression were the _Congressmen_
of both the 'moderates' and 'extremist' sections and politically
conscious individuals, organizations and newspapers.

Even before the Surat session, the Viceroy had issued, in
May 1907, an ordinance empowering local authorities to
prohibit public meetings and prohibiting the holding of public
meetings without prior permission. There were also indications
that further repressive measures were in the offing. The
ordinance was designed to place obstacles before all forms
of legitimate political activities.

Many, including the Secretary of State for India, Lord
Morley, questioned the desirability of such measures. But
the Government of India secured the approval of the British
government on the plea that these measures were essential
to face 'extremist' politics which, according to them, was
gaining strength in India. The decision taken by the
'moderates' at the Surat session to part company with the
'extremists' helped them to take this course. The authorities
went ahead with the expectation that the 'moderate' leaders
would lend support at least indirectly to these repressive
measures.

In 1908, the Press Act was enacted which empowered
authorities to close down the publication of any newspaper
and confiscate any printing press at the discretion of the _District
Magistrate_.

The Explosives Act was another measure which provided
for deportation for 14 years of any person found in possession
of a bomb or the materials for making bomb or any
person assisting in the making of bomb. The act also contained
another provision for deportation for 20 years of any
person who exploded or intended or tried to explode a bomb.

A third Act empowered the authorities to ban any organization
which they found to be functioning in a manner
prejudicial to the "law and order" of the country, and to imprison
any person participating in the activities of a banned organization,
and to confiscate any building, property or material
found to be used for the activities of such an organization.

In brief, the legislations passed in this period were
designed to curb the activities of political parties and mass
organizations.

Even the 'moderates' could not but protest against these
measures. They pointed out that the curbs on the activities
of organizations would only create further discontent among
the people in disguised forms. They accused the government
of unleashing repressive measures which would only
facilitate the rapid growth of the 'extremists' and revolutionary
groups among them, who were being sharply criticized by
the 'moderates'.

True, the targets of attack of the government were the
'extremists' and revolutionary groups. For example, Tilak
was prosecuted and sentenced under all these acts. Similarly,
many other 'extremists' were arrested and imprisoned under the
provisions of these Acts. Many were sentenced to transportation
for life[^penal-transportation]. The publication of the newspapers _Bande Mataram_,
_Sandhya_ and _Yugantar_ had to be discontinued.

[^penal-transportation]: _Penal transportation_ or _transportation_ was the relocation of convicted criminals, or other persons regarded as undesirable, to a distant place, often a colony, for a specified term; later, specifically established penal colonies became their destination, sometimes for life.

At the same time, actions were also taken against several
newspapers which could not at all be considered to be sympathetic
to the 'extremists'. This and the restrictions imposed
on political propaganda through public meetings created
obstacles in the way of the functioning of even the 'moderates'.
The repressive measures introduced on the pretext of
curbing the activities of the 'extremists' and revolutionary
groups were in effect turned against the activities of all those
who were interested in politics.

It was in these circumstances that another movement
emerged throughout the country as different from the 'extremist'
movement led by Tilak and others, but grown in concert
with it to some extent. Like the 'extremist' movement, this
new movement, which was variously known as 'terrorist
movement', 'revolutionary movement', etc., was against the
'petition politics' of the Congress under the 'moderate' leadership.
Like the 'extremists', they also were of the opinion that
no problem could be solved by submitting petition to the
authorities. But the alternative to the 'petition politics'
suggested by the 'extremists', _i.e._, conducting agitations with
the support of the people organized through meetings, demonstrations
and newspapers and other publications did not
satisfy them. Along with the agitational programme suggested
by the 'extremists' they considered it necessary to physically
eliminate the hated government officials by using
fire-arms or bombs. And for this purpose, they had been
organizing secret groups, collecting arms and training the
youth in their use.

This movement had its beginning towards the closing
years of the 19th century in Bengal and Maharashtra. The
first act of murder attributed to this movement took place
in Maharashtra. A British official, who was regarded as the
symbol of the barbaric acts of the bureaucracy in the name
of providing relief to the people of Maharashtra in the days
of famine and plague in 1897, was murdered, along with
another British official. We have already mentioned this
incident and the action taken by the government against
Tilak, foisting on him the responsibility for it. In fact,
Tilak had nothing to do with this incident. It was organized by
a secret organization formed independently of the movement
led by him. If at all this group had any connection
with the movement led by Tilak, it was only the indignation
of the people at the brutalities committed by the officials,
and the desire to resist such acts. The accused in the killing
were sentenced to death. This, however, did not destroy
the movement. Instead, certain secret groups in the name of
'Abhinav Bharat' sprang up all over Maharashtra. Vinayak
Damodar Savarkar, the leader of movement, subsequently
shifted his activities to England and tried to start a revolution
in India with whatever help he could get there. This
group, with branches all over Maharashtra, played a prominent
role in developing a revolutionary movement not merely
in Maharashtra but also all over India. Savarkar was
arrested in England. While he was being brought to India
with police escort, he tried to escape but was again caught
by the police. This incident had became a legend.

During the same period, a revolutionary organization
called Anushilan Samiti was formed in Bengal. The Samiti
and other revolutionary organizations were organized by
young men inspired by the radical oriented journals like
_Yugantar_, and other publications. These organizations formed
under the leadership of Aurobindo Ghosh, his brother Berindra
Kumar Ghosh and others presented before the members a
programme giving the details of an armed confrontation
with the British rule by organizing revolutionary activities.
The organization that emerged in Bengal was more widespread
and stronger than those formed in Maharashtra.

As we have seen earlier, the murder of two British officials
in 1897 occurred in Maharashtra before the formation of the
all-India movement based on the 'extremist' slogans of _Swadeshi_,
_Swaraj_, etc. The growth of the 'extremist' political movement
and the repression let loose by the government following the
split in the Congress at Surat strengthened this trend. Unlike
the isolated incident in Maharashtra in 1897, political murders
began to occur on a wider scale. Although the first incident
among these occurred in Bihar, the target of the revolutionaries
was an official who had given orders for whipping in
public some young political activists of Calcutta. But the
attack aimed at this official, who was subsequently transferred
to Muzzaffarpur in Bihar, fell on the wife and daughter of
another official. Both of them were killed in the attack.

Of the two accused in this case, one, Profulla Chakki,
shot himself dead soon after his arrest and the other,
Khudiram Bose, was sentenced to death. In the course of
the investigations connected with this incident, the police
caught a sizable amount of arms, including bombs and dynamites
as well as several individuals connected with the arms.
A case known as the _Alipore Conspiracy Case_ was instituted
against them. The Public Prosecutor and a Deputy Police
Superintendent connected with the trial were shot dead. Fifteen
of the accused were sentenced to life imprisonment, but the
foremost leader of the organization, Aurobindo Ghosh,
escaped.

The activities of the secret organizations in Bengal did
not, however, subside with this trial. The accused who were
sentenced to death for the Muzaffarpur murder and those
imprisoned in the _conspiracy case_ were honoured as martyrs
and heroes. Hundreds of young men and women were attracted
to the politics of the bomb. The feeling began to grow rapidly
among the people of the younger generation that in the
context of a political situation wherein even the 'moderate'
leaders of the Congress, leave alone the 'extremists' like Tilak
and Bipin Chandra Pal, were unable to function freely and
independently, there was no way other than physically eliminating
the British officials and their Indian henchmen.

It has been estimated that not less than 64 persons
belonging to such categories as high police officials, officials
of the lower ranks who had earned notoriety for cruel acts of
repression, police spys and prosecution witnesses, were killed
at the hands of revolutionaries in Bengal between 1907 and 1917. The revolutionaries also committed a series of robberies
in order to raise funds for their activities. An official estimate
put the number of robberies committed during this period at 112 and the amount thus collected at Rs 700,000.

Although much smaller in scale, similar secret groups
were also formed in other provinces like Bihar, Orissa, Punjab,
Rajasthan and Madras. There, too, political murders were
committed. Several young political workers were arrested
and imprisoned in connection with such incidents as also in
circumstances unconnected with them. They also had to face
_conspiracy cases_, transportation for life and other repressive
actions.

During the same period, revolutionary groups emerged
amongst the Indian residents in England and other European
countries, in America, Canada, etc. Efforts were also made
to co-ordinate the activities of the Indians living abroad.
"India House", the residence of Shyamji Krishna Verma,
the Indian _Home Rule_ Society organized by him and the
periodical _Indian Sociologist_ published by him became the
centres of activities of Indian residents in London. Verma,
Madame Cama, Savarkar (who as we have noted earlier had
shifted his activities to England), Har Dayal and others tried
to establish relation with Indians residing in the European
countries and in America. They started working as a
revolutionary group in concert with, but independent of, the
'moderate'-led Congress as well as the 'extremist' group within
the Congress. Later, when the World War started, these
groups prepared plans to start a revolution utilizing the favourable
circumstances created by the war and securing arms and
other assistance from international sources and in cooperation
with the patriotic sections of the Indian army.

These revolutionary activities which were carried on in
various places in various forms made one thing clear: No step
or measure being taken by the rulers to put out the urge for
independence of the people was adequate to achieve the ends.
The younger generation expressed their _anti-imperialist_
feelings secretly where it was not possible to express it openly,
and carried out political activities illegally, where functioning
in the legal way was denied to them. Now they were
ready to face with 'bomb politics' the authorities who were
suppressing even the agitational politics of the 'moderate'
leadership.

This was a trend that appeared at a certain stage in the
revolutionary movement not only in India but all over the
world. For example, this line of thinking influenced the youth
in Russia before the emergence of the proletarian revolutionary
movement under the leadership of Lenin. Even Lenin's
brother was influenced by it, and he made an attempt on the
life of the Czar, for which he was sentenced to death. They,
however realized later, as Lenin stated soon after this incident,
that "this was not the path of the Russian revolutionaries".
Russia made its revolution only when the working class and
other labouring masses came to realize that it was not a group
of adventurists settling accounts individually with rulers
notorious for anti-people acts but the masses fighting organized
battles to overthrow the exploiting classes, that decided
the future of the revolution. Referring to the experience of
the working class strikes that took place in India at that
time, Lenin stated that in India too, the same forces had
started emerging. But the younger generation of Indian
revolutionaries failed to realize this fact at that time.

## THE BEGINNING OF HINDU-MUSLIM CONFLICTS

The rulers realized that the tempestuous independence
struggle sweeping across the country could not be suppressed
by repressive measures alone. So they decided to use certain
other means. One such means was to isolate the entire
Muslim community from the independence struggle, thereby
creating the impression that the community as a whole was
with the British.

A move in this direction had already been started
towards the end of the 19th century. But it was only after
the rise of the country-wide protest agitation against the
partition of Bengal that an all-India political organization
of the Muslims --- the _Muslim League_ --- was formed parallel
to the _Indian National Congress_.

Not only on the question of partition of Bengal but also
on several other issues that came up later in the history of
the _freedom struggle_, the imperialists used this organization
to split the freedom movement. When they were ultimately
compelled to leave the country, they were able to divide the
country into Indian Union and Pakistan and to earn the
support of the Muslim community on that score.

The Machiavellian tactics used by the British and the
policy of the _Muslim League_ leadership helpful to make the
tactics effective, had rightly been criticized by the nationalists.
It is undisputable that the British rulers consolidated their
domination in India by creating a division between the
Hindus and Muslims and utilized the communal feeling of
the Muslims to curb the urge for freedom, and that the
Muslim leaders did acquiesced in it.

This does not, however, complete the real picture of
Indian politics over a span of three quarters of a century.
For, medieval India, though not as dark as the British historians
have painted it, was marked by both friendship and
contradictions between Hindus and Muslims. And the history
was viewed from that perspective. There has been a widespread
tendency to characterize the people's fights against the
autocratic rule of Muslim rulers and _Zamindars_ in the medieval
India as fights between Hindus and Muslims without
perceiving the reality that basic to such fights was the contradiction
between the rulers and the people.

For instance, when the _Marathas_ waged a struggle under
the leadership of Shivaji towards the end of the Muslim
empire, that struggle was characterized as a fight between the
Hindus and the Muslim rulers. Again, when Shivaji commemoration
festivals were organized by Tilak, it was interpreted
as an anti-Muslim as well as an _anti-British_ move.

When the British advanced step by step and ultimately
established themselves as rulers in Delhi, the capital of the
_Mughal Empire_, a majority among the Muslim community
felt that their own community was thrown out of power. That
was why the Muslim masses were more active in the 1857--59
popular revolt than the Hindu masses. In the period before
the revolt, on the other hand, the members of the Muslim
community were lagging behind the Hindus in acquiring
English education and the _resultant_ modernization. It was
only after the failure of the revolt and the rapid modernization
among the Hindus that efforts began to be made to
introduce modernization in the Muslim community under the
leadership of Syed Ahmed Khan and others. As a natural
result of this, the Muslims were far behind the Hindus in
modern education and consequently in employment in the
government, in politics, commerce and industry. They
feared that members of the Muslim community would be
pushed out in the competition for success in these fields.

During the same period, agitations to secure a bigger
share for Indians in government jobs and in the administration
had already started under the initiative of the Hindus
who had made advance in these fields. The _Indian National
Congress_ was, in fact, organized for this purpose. Members
of the Muslim community with a sense of realism could foresee
that the government would be compelled to yield to the
slogans of the Congress to the extent the agitation organized
under its leadership gained strength. The Muslim elites
feared that in the event Indians got more jobs and political
power their community would be behind others in this
regard. This was basic to the attitude of Syed Ahmed
Khan and other leaders towards the Congress in its initial
stages. It was the opinion of Ahmed Khan at that time that
taking part in the anti-government agitations and supporting
the Congress would be detrimental to the best interests of
the Muslims. He therefore advised the members of the
Muslim community to concentrate exclusively on efforts to
improve socially and educationally.

It was this fact of the attitude of _non-cooperation_ on
the part of a large majority of the Muslims towards the Congress
that the British rulers utilized them against the Congress.
But it must be pointed out that the elitist leaders of the Muslim
community only refrained from cooperating with the Congress;
they did not directly oppose the Congress.

A change in the situation came about with the partition
of Bengal and the consequent agitation against it. The propaganda
let loose by the British that the Hindu dominated
Congress was opposing the partition because the new (East
Bengal) province was under the control of the Muslims considerably
influenced the Muslims. Even those Muslim leaders
who generally supported the political demands of the Congress,
rallied themselves against the Congress on the issue
of the partition of Bengal.

A Muslim delegation headed by the Aga Khan went to
Simla and submitted a representation to the Viceroy on the 1st
October 1906. The memorandum related to the loss of the
status once enjoyed by the Muslims and the concessions they
must get from the government to compensate for their lost
status. Following this, the _All India Muslim League_ was
formed at a meeting held in December that year.

It is an irrefutable fact that some British officials had a
role in sending the delegation to Simla and also in the formation
of the _Muslim League_. And for that reason the
opponents of the _League_ sought to label the organization
'agents of the British'. But if this contention were to be
accepted as such, the Congress too would have to be labelled
similarly, since certain high British officials had played a
prominent role in the formation of this organization.

It is true that there was a difference between the two.
Although the Congress was organized with the help and
assistance of British officials, it gradually adopted _anti-British_
attitudes and policies. The authorities encouraged the
_Muslim League_ with a view to weaken the Congress.

It is, however, indisputable that in the initial stage the
British officials came forward to form the _Indian National
Congress_ with a view to giving the general political consciousness
developed amongst the educated middle class and
the discontent of the people an organized form, thereby
preventing this discontent from going "beyond the limit".
Similarly, in the later stage, they took interest in the formation
of the _Muslim League_ in order to give an organized form
to the growing discontent amongst the new generation of
educated Muslims and to turn that community against the
Congress, thereby consolidating their own position.

So, this raises the real question as to why the process
of development of dissatisfaction among the entire people
and of political consciousness among the educated in the
first stage took the form of an exclusive politics of Muslims
and its organization, the Muslim League, in the second stage.

A factor relevant in finding an answer to this question
has been indicated earlier. The Hindus entertained the idea
that independence from British rule would mean the revival
of the old Hindu-dominated society in India, while to the
Muslims, it meant the re-establishment of the Muslim domination
of the days of _Delhi Sultanate_ and the _Mughal Empire_.
Inevitably, these opposing meanings of independence came
into conflict with each other. The political leaders belonging
to both the communities cannot escape from the responsibility
for this development.

Even before the partition of Bengal, another event had
occurred arousing the feelings of the people of both the
communities. Urdu was the official language throughout
North India from the time of the Mughal rule. Hindus contended
that since Urdu was not the language of the majority
of the people of the region, the language of the majority,
namely Hindi, must also be given the status of official language.
On 8th April 1900, the Government of United Provinces
accepting the plea, directed that petitions to the government
written both in Urdu and Hindi would be accepted and that
government notifications would henceforth be published in
both the languages.

Muslims resented this order. They organized protest
meetings throughout the Province against this measure which
they considered would deprive the Urdu language of the
prominence it had during the period of the Muslim rule. On
the other hand, the Hindus organized meetings supporting
the government order. Thus, the relations between the Hindus
and the Muslims became extremely tense.

Evidently, the issue based on which the Muslims conducted
their agitation was unjust. It must be noted that the fight
of the Muslim elite at that time was not over the right to use
Urdu as a language of a minority, a demand for which their
own descendants and all democratic minded people had to
fight later. On the contrary, they were obstinate in their
demand that the majority must not have the right to use their
language, Hindi.

Nevertheless, it will not be true to state that the Hindu-Muslim
dispute was the creation of this and similar
unjustifiable demands raised by the Muslim elites. For, there
were the elements of Hindu revivalism in the views of Hindu
nationalists before and after the inception of the Congress,
even after the emergence of an 'extremist' section within it.
For example, one could see clearly the Hindu outlook in the
works of the famous Bengali writer Bankim Chatterjee, and
in the writings and speeches of the 'extremist' leaders like
Tilak, Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo Ghosh, Bipin Chandra Pal,
etc. Even the most respected of the 'extremists', Tilak, had
stated that all Indians must be true to _Bhagavat Gita_, _Mahabharata_
and _Ramayana_ and that they were the common family
property of all Indians.

Bipin Chandra Pal and other Bengali 'extremists', on
the other hand, regarded service to the country as the worship
of "Devi", and their political activities were directed
towards creating such an atmosphere. And Aurobindo Ghosh,
the most eminent among them, subordinated politics and
history to the outlook based on religion. (This motivated him
later to give up politics and become a _Sanyasin_.) Lajpat Rai
went a step ahead and put forth the idea of forming a separate
political organization of the Hindus. In short, the origin
of Hindu politics that helped the emergence in later years of
the _Hindu Mahasabha_ and the _Rashtriya Swayamsevak
Sangh_ (RSS) could be seen clearly in the political outlook
of these 'extremist' revolutionary leaders.

This is not intended to underestimate the role played by
these leaders in building up the _anti-British_ movement.
Undisputedly, they were the respected and revered leaders of
the people. But they all tried to forge _anti-imperialism_,
patriotism and the desire for the country's freedom in the
mould of the Hindu outlook which they inherited from the
past. For this reason, their political activities, on the one
hand, attracted the Hindu masses into the freedom movement,
and on the other, turned the non-Hindus, especially the
Muslim masses, against the freedom movement or, at least,
made them indifferent to it. This is the fact.

Thus, parallel to this rising waves of the _anti-imperialist_
movement based on Hindu revivalist outlook, the educated
generation of the Muslim community began imbibing the
outlook of Islamic revivalism. It was in this background
that the British rulers devised the plan to partition Bengal.
The direct result of it was an intense conflict between the
Hindu and Muslim masses. The Hindu masses considered that
the partition of Bengal would equally endanger the common
interests of the country and the interests of their own community.
The Muslims, on the other hand, regarded that the
Hindu leaders in general and Congress leaders in particular
were intent on wresting from them their legitimate rights.
The British rulers utilized this situation as an ideal opportunity
to create conflicts between the two communities in order
to disrupt the unity of the freedom movement.

The seeds of discord thus sown in the days immediately
following the partition of Bengal led to a divided independent
India in 1947.

## POLICY OF APPEASEMENT

The British rulers came to realize that their policy of
repression and of creating a division between the Hindu and
Muslim communities would not help in curbing the intense
urge of the masses for freedom and in stemming the advance
of the mass movement arising out of it. They, therefore,
decided to adopt yet another tactic.

As we have seen, the Congress had gone into the hands
of 'moderate' leadership following the split in the organization.
The government soon began its moves to appease the
Congress with a new slogan of "rallying the 'moderates'
behind the British rulers".

The Secretary of State for India was the well known
liberal, John Morley. Personally, he was opposed to the
partition of Bengal and to the policy of suppression of the
agitation against the partition and of the _Swadeshi_ movement.
But, under the pressure of the British officials in India and of
the government, he was compelled to justify the steps taken
by them and defend them in the Parliament. He was also
compelled to state repeatedly that the partition of Bengal
was a _fait accompli_, which could not be revoked.

The partition of Bengal and the repression unleashed
by the government caused embarrassment not only to Morley
in England, but also to leaders like Gokhale in India. Obliged
as they were to take care of the feelings of the people of
India, they could not but oppose the acts of the Government.
At the same time, they were frightened by the development
of the movement against these acts in which people were
participating in thousands. They realized that the government
actions would only make the situation get out of control and
enhance the influence of the 'extremists'.

It was to get out of these difficulties that certain proposals
for "_administrative reforms_" emerged out of the parallel
efforts made by some liberal-minded rulers under Morley in
England and the 'moderate' political leaders like Gokhale in
India. At a certain stage, the leaders of these two sections
exchanged their views in this regard, and even arrived at
some informal understanding.

It was when the tide of anti-partition agitation was rising
high in the country that the Prince of Wales (who later became
King George V) visited India. Attempts were made to turn
the country-wide _boycott_ movement into a movement of
protest against the royal visit. But, the 'moderates' under the
leadership of Gokhale were able to stall this attempt. Even
so, the prince felt the intensity of the feelings of the people
of India during his visit. He became convinced of the impossibility
of suppressing the movement merely by resorting to
repressive measures.

He advised Morley that the government policy should
sympathetically view the feelings of the people, while at the
same time taking a firm stand on the maintenance of "law
and order". This advice strengthened the hands of Morley.

It was at this same time that the 'moderate' leadership in
India made certain moves. In a speech delivered in the
Central Legislative Council in March 1906, Gokhale pleaded
with the Viceroy to appease the educated sections of the
people by giving them more and more opportunities to
participate in the administration of the country.

Soon after that Gokhale left for England. During his 10-week stay in England, Gokhale and Morley held five
rounds of talk, as a result of which certain formal understandings
were arrived at between them. Morley assured
Gokhale that the number of elected representatives in the
central and provincial legislatures would be increased, with
more powers to the non-official members. He emphasized, at
the same time, that "_self-government_", even as demanded
by the 'moderate' section of the Congress, was unacceptable
and warned that if the Congress still pursued an agitational
course raising more demands or stressed on the re-unification
of Bengal, the government would not implement even these
limited reforms.

Morley added that he knew that it would be difficult
for Gokhale to accept this position _in toto_, since it was difficult
for the 'moderate' leadership of the Congress to take a stand
against the slogans of _Swadeshi_ and _Boycott_ which had the
backing of a powerful popular movement. Similarly, he
wanted Gokhale and other leaders to appreciate the difficulties
that Morley and his colleagues were facing and requested
him to work with such a perspective.

Gokhale did not accept this request, nor did he reject
it openly. But, the subsequent events showed that Gokhale
had already decided to cooperate with the Government as
requested by Morley.

The Surat session of the Congress was held about 18 months after the Gokhale-Morley talks. As we have seen
earlier, the issues before that session were those that were
raised in the talks: Whether the Congress was moving towards
a struggle for the revocation of the partition of Bengal and
for _self-rule_ (_Swaraj_) or towards a compromise with the
British rulers. As we also know. this was the question that
separated the 'extremists' and the 'moderates' from each other.

Owing to the intense _anti-British_ feeling of the masses,
Gokhale could not make even his colleagues of the 'moderate'
section accept the conciliatory approach towards the
rulers as suggested by Morley. It took more than a year
for him to bring them round to accept that position. At the
first session of the Congress held after the Gokhale-Morley
talks (the Calcutta session), resolutions accepting the radical
programmes at least partially had to be passed. It was after
constant and strenuous efforts after this session that the 'moderates'
were able to obviate the "nuisance" of the 'extremists'
and re-organize the Congress on completely 'moderate' lines.

Morley also had to remove a number of obstacles from
his path. The majority of bureaucrats in India, including the
then Viceroy Lord Minto and a considerable section of
political leaders in England held views opposed to that of
Morley. However, through persistent efforts, he was able
to remove all the obstacles and come up with a new administrative
scheme known as the '_Minto-Morley reforms_'.

These _administrative reforms_ came into effect through an
Act of the British Parliament and the rules framed under it.
The number of members in the central and provincial legislatures
was increased along with the proportion of the elected
members in these bodies. However, official members still
constituted a majority (36 out of 68) in the central legislature.
The non-official members constituted a majority in the
provincial legislatures. But, since they included nominated
members, the official members and the nominated non-official
members together constituted the majority. Not only in
representation but also in the matter of rights of the members,
the new constitution contained some provisions which were
comparatively progressive. It gave members the right to discuss
financial matters including the budget, and vote on them. It
also gave them the right to bring issues of public interest under
discussion. Till then the members had to remain satisfied
with just listening to the replies given by the government to the
questions raised by them. Under the new system, they could
also raise supplementary questions, providing opportunities
to bring out the truth on the matters that were raised through
questions.

But, even these wider powers given to the people's
representative did not make the rulers responsible to them.
For, any resolution passed by the legislatures was only
recommendatory which could be either accepted or rejected
by the government. For these reasons, the new "_administrative
reforms_" were not acceptable even to the 'moderates' who
felt the need to further improve both in the representation and
the rights of the representatives in the legislature. There
was another provision in the new Act which strengthened this
feeling. It related to the provisions added on the pretext of
giving "the Muslim community the representation they
deserve."

It must be noted in this connection that the ideas that
emerged in the Morley-Gokhale talks held in 1906 were basic
to the provisions in the reforms stipulating the nature of
people's representation in the central and provincial
legislatures and the extent of the powers of the people's
representations. We know that Morley sought the cooperation
of Gokhale with the assurance that while the demands
for legislatures with elected majority and governments responsible
to the legislatures were clearly unacceptable, something
would be done on these matters. At the same time, the
authorities, both in England and in India, were striving to
split the independence movement by organizing the Muslim
community and by creating an impression that their demands
were being conceded. It was around this time that the visit
of the Muslim delegation to Simla and the formation of All
India _Muslim League_ took place. Therefore, the Parliamentary
legislation embodying the proposals for "_administrative
reforms_" and the rules framed thereunder by the Government
of India came up giving importance to the "Hindu-Muslim
problem". For instance, of the 27 members to be elected to
the Central Legislative Council, 13 were to be from general
constituencies and six from constituencies reserved for
Muslims. Of the remaining eight members, six were to be
elected from constituencies reserved for landlords and two
from traders' constituencies. Similar was the pattern of
representation in the provincial legislatures with constituencies
reserved for Muslims, landlords and vested interests.

This was a provision that created discontent and resentment
even among the 'moderates'. This was indeed the
primary form of a problem that later bothered all those
who were involved in Indian politics. It was for the above
reasons that the first conference of the Congress held after
the details of the administrative reform" were made known,
passed a resolution opposing the different provisions in
the _Reforms Act_. including the provision to allocate separate
constituencies for the Muslim community. It must be
remembered that the 'extremist' section of the Congress at
this stage, _i.e._, in 1909, was outside the organization.

If this was the position of the 'moderates', it was no
wonder that the reaction of the 'extremists' was much stronger.
They declared that the _Reforms Act_ was only a shadow of
"_administrative reforms_". The leaders of the 'extremists',
including Tilak, were at that time in prison and actions
were being taken against the rank and file. The press had
been gagged. Thus, the _Reforms Act_ came into force at a
time when the voice of the 'extremists' was not likely to be
heard.

The 'moderates', on the other hand, felt that despite the
limitations, the provisions contained in the Act would, to
some extent, help protect the interests of the classes and
the sections of the people they represented. They thought
that the new provisions would be useful to the landlords
and those who were holding dominant positions in the spheres
of trade and industry in protecting their respective
interests and for the politically active intellectuals in becoming
the leaders of the nation by utilizing the forum of the new
legislatures. They also felt confident of utilizing the provisions
of the Act to secure more and more powers. Thus,
the slogan of "rallying the 'moderates' behind the rulers",
which had so far remained on paper, was becoming a practical
reality.

An event that demonstrated the direct result of this stand
of the 'moderates' occurred very soon. The new legislature
constituted under the 1909 _Reforms Act_ met. One of the
legislative measures that came up for discussion before
the new House was the one that was designed to curb the freedom
of the Press. It sought to prevent by law not only such
obviously violent activities as political murders, robberies and
conspiracies, but also to make it a punishable offence to oppose
in any manner the continuance of the British rule. Een the
'moderates', true to their declared principles, ought to have
opposed this measure. But Gokhale and his colleagues, who
were members of the new Central Legislative Council, supported
these measures. Expressing satisfaction at this stand of
the 'moderates', Viceroy Minto said:

>The expanded Central
Legislative Council which fully represents the Indian interests
has given approval to the Act which can rightly be called
"repressive". They agree with the Government that it is
for the well-being of the country. Thus, it has been proved
that giving more representation to the Indian communities
and interests does not weaken the British administration,
but further strengthens it.

But, there was another issue which remained unresolved.
The authorities realized that the people would not remain
peaceful until the partition of Bengal was revoked, and finally
had to revoke it in 1911, forming a new province comprising
Bihar and Orissa, restoring the old province of Assam and
forming a united Province of Bengal.

For the first time in the history of _freedom struggle_, the
government was forced to yield to the might of the popular
agitation. The result: a new principle of "one province for
the people who speak one language" was also brought into practice.
This was the beginning of a series of incidents which
became famous in the later days of the freedom movement.

## THE SOUTH AFRICAN STRUGGLE

Following the reunification of Bengal, there was a
thorough change in the Indian political scene. Before we start
examining these developments, it is, however, necessary to
make a reference to the problems of Indians in South Africa
and their struggle to solve these problems.

Thousands of people in India finding it hard to live in
the country owing to the growing pauperization of the rural
population had left the country after the establishment of
the British rule in India. Among the various countries they
went in search of means of livelihood, a large number of
them reached South Africa and settled down there as labourers.
Among those who thus migrated to South Africa
included also merchants, lawyers, teachers and persons
occupying such other high positions.

There was one problem of life which all members
of the Indian community had to face in South Africa,
irrespective of the economic and social positions they occupied.
The South African rulers were the Whites with the racist
outlook of White superiority. The racist White regime treated
even those Indians who were occupying a relatively better
position in life as members of an inferior race. Feelings
against this discriminatory treatment stirred the entire Indian
community residing in South Africa.

It is true that this problem was not peculiar to South
Africa. It was the common practice of the European imperialists
to ignore and humiliate the Blacks and coloured people.
It was, in fact, the protest against the policy of the British
rulers in India of excluding Indians from all high official
positions and keeping them off the administrative machinery
that led to the slogan of "_Swaraj_" and to the agitational
programmes based on that slogan. The problem of Indian
residents in South Africa was distinct from those of the
Indians settlers elsewhere. It consists of the fact that a
mass movement had developed in South Africa against
the racial discrimination followed by the White rulers. And
this movement had won the sympathies of social and political
organizations, including the Congress. Resolutions relating
to the problem of "South African Indians" were adopted in
many of the Congress sessions and several public meetings
organized in various parts of the country. It had thus become
a part of Indian politics.

The topmost leader of this struggle was Mohandas
Karamchand Gandhi who subsequently held sway in the Indian
politics as its undisputed leader for nearly three decades, and
came to be revered as '_Mahatma_' Gandhi. At that time he was
not connected with the internal political developments in
India. But the struggle he conducted for Indians in South
Africa had earned the sympathies of the _Congressmen_,
_Leaguers_ and other no-party leaders. Even the founder
of the Tata family, Ratan Tata, the _Nizam_ of Hyderabad.
the Aga Khan and many others contributed to and collected
funds in aid of the South African Indian struggles. In fact,
the attack on the Indians in South Africa has caused concern
to a wide range of political leaders in India, from the
'extremists' organizing struggles for "_Swadeshi_" and "_Swaraj_"
to those advocating protection of their 'special interests' as
a community.

The programme developed by Gandhi to resist the White
racial domination was _Satyagraha_. Later, in the years
following the First World War, this came to be used widely in
Indian politics also. We shall examine later the various stages
of this struggle in India, the various forms it took and other
related matters. However, certain features characteristic of
the struggle of South African Indians must be dealt with here,
because these were the features which appeared in different
forms later on in the Gandhian method of struggle in India.

One of the features, as just indicated, was that the
struggle was launched and developed by rallying the entire
community of South African Indians, irrespective of their
status in life, whether they be rich or poor. Its main force
was provided by the illiterate and the till then helpless
common people. The contribution of the 'Gandhian form of
struggle' which was in its infancy, was that it inculcated
self-confidence and a sense of self-reliance in them. D. G.
Tendulkar, the biographer of Gandhi, described an incident
as follows.

>A Tamil man in tattered clothes, head-gear in hand, with
two front teeth broken and his mouth bleeding stood before
the young barrister (Gandhi). Gandhi was shocked to see
this spectacle and persuaded him to put his turban on and
behave like an equal. It was a new experience to the poor
slave. Balasundaram, as this poor visitor was called, was
serving his indenture under a well-known European resident
of Durban. His master beat the helpless worker till he
bled. Gandhi sent for a doctor to secure a certificate and
look the injured man to a magistrate. It was not Gandhi's
desire to get the employer punished, but he wanted Balasundaram
to be released from him. Like the slave, the
indentured labourer was the property of his master.
Gandhi succeeded in transferring him to someone else.
Balasundaram's case reached the ears of every indentured
labourer as far as Madras and Gandhi came to be regarded
as their friend.[^07/4]

[^07/4]: D. G. Tendulkur, _Mahatma: Life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi_,
Bombay, Vishalbhai K Jhaveri and D, G. Tendulkar, 1951, Vol. I,
p. 52.


Following such other incidents, a new sense of
self-confidence grew among Indian workers in South Africa.
They were able to stand firm in an organized manner with
surprising courage in the struggles to protect their rights.
Nearly 6,000 coal miners went on a strike. Particularly, the
women workers who participated in the strike demonstrated
heroism and organizational consciousness in an unprecedented
manner. On a historic demonstration staged in connection
with the strike Tendulkar wrote:

>The strike was in full swing and the stream of labourers
still continued by rail and road. Two women with grim
courage reached Charlstown though their little ones died
on the way. One of the children died of exposure on the
march and the other fell down from the arms of its mother
while she was crossing a stream and was drowned. But the
brave mothers refused to be dejected and one of them said:
We must not pine for the dead who will not come back to
us for all our pining. It is the living for whom we must
work.[^07/5]

[^07/5]: _Ibid_, p. 170.

Gandhi had numerous such experiences which had
inspired him throughout his lifetime. Speaking at a felicitation
meeting in his and his wife's honour at Madras several
years later, Gandhi said:

>If one-tenth of the language that has been used in this
address is deserved by us, what language do you propose
to use for those who have lost their lives, and therefore
finished their work, on behalf of your suffering countrymen
in South Africa ? What language do you propose to
use for Nagappan, Narayanaswamy, lads of seventeen or
eighteen years, who braved in simple faith all the trials, all
the sufferings, and all for the motherland? What language
do you propose to use with reference to Valliamma, a
sweet girl of sixteen years, who was discharged from
Maritzburg prison, skin and bone, suffering from fever to
which she succumbed after about a month's time? You
have said that I inspired those great men and women,
but I cannot accept that proposition. It was they, the
simple-minded folk, who worked away in faith, never
expecting the slightest reward, who inspired me to the
proper level, and who compelled me by their great sacrifice,
by their great faith, by their trust in the great God
to do the work that I was able to do. ... They deserve the
crown which you would seek to impose upon us. ... These
young men deserve all the adjectives that you have affectionately
but blindly lavished on us. ... [^07/6]

[^07/6]: _Ibid_, pp. 200--201.

A movement of this kind had not yet emerged in the
_freedom struggle_ in India. The tendency to draw inspiration
from organized struggles of ordinary labourers, as it was in
the case of the struggles of South African Indians, was
absent even in the 'extremist' movement led by Tilak or in
the revolutionary movement which emerged independent of,
but inspired by, the former, leave alone the movements led
by the 'moderates' in the Congress and the _Muslim League_
which was formed to challenge it.

Even Tilak who ventured to take the message of
agitation and struggle to the rural masses perishing under
the spell of famine and epidemics and to the industrial workers
fighting for reduction of working hours, wage rise and
other demands, failed to get inspiration from the illiterate
and helpless masses of people, as Gandhi got in the course
of his work in South Africa. Tilak who could inspire the
people using his enormously talented leadership and living an
exemplary life of self-sacrifice could not get inspiration from
the people and return it to the people giving it an organized
form, as Gandhi was able to do. Even before Tilak could
think in terms of transforming the _Swadeshi_ and _boycott_
movements into a resistance movement, Gandhi had already
put into practice such a form of struggle.

The same holds for the revolutionary movements of Bengal
and other parts of the country during the closing period of
the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. True, the
revolutionaries who had thrown themselves into the fire of
struggle, ready to sacrifice their lives and everything that
they had in the struggle for the liberation of the country,
rightly earned the love and respect of the people. The soil
of our country is reddened with their blood. But these
revolutionaries depended mostly upon their own individual
heroism and militancy. They could not create, as Gandhi
did, heroes like Valliamma, Nagappan, Narayanaswamy, etc.,
following the Balasundaram incident in South Africa.
They failed to perceive that the main condition for a successful
revolution is the creation of thousands of such heroes
and heroines through organized struggles.

Before closing this section, it is necessary to specially
mention here a feature of the Gandhian method of struggle
which appeared in primary form in the South African struggles
but matured only subsequently. Although Gandhi was
able to get inspiration from the masses of the people and evolve
a method of struggle based on the inspiration thus derived,
his general political perception was different from all others
hitherto prevalent in Indian politics. All the social and
political movements in India, from the social reform movement
led by Raja Ram Mohan Roy to the radical and
revolutionary movements in general arose as a part of the
efforts to modernize India along the capitalist line. This
tendency towards modernization was discernible even in the
movements initiated by Ramakrishna-Vivekananda, the _Arya
Samaj_ and the _Muslim League_, which appeared in the grab
of conservatism. Gandhi, on the other hand, tried to pull
India back by millennia, instead of modernizing it. The
rudimentary form of this Gandhian perception could be seen
in his _Hind Swaraj_, written in 1908, in which he sharply
condemned not only the British rulers but also the symbols
of modern civilization they introduced in India, such as the
railways, post and telegraph, telephone and even the modern
medical science. He believed that the metropolitan cities of
India like Bombay and Calcutta were socially decadent and
that they were destroying the people. He declared that
"India would not really be free unless it completely unlearned
what it had learned in the past fifty years" and that the
railways, hospitals, lawyers, doctors, etc., should cease to
exist.

This retrogressive outlook did not, however, negatively
influence the South African struggle. In that struggle launched
for the solution of a relatively simple issue, socio-political
perception of a fundamental nature was not of much
relevance. Later on, however, when the same method of
struggle was used in India's internal politics, the merits and
demerits of the Gandhian outlook stood out. The people in
South Africa and India could perceive only the _anti-imperialist_
character of the South African struggle.

## AGITATION FOR LINGUISTIC STATES: ITS BEGINNING

The echoes of the struggle of the people of Bengal
against the partition of the province were heard in other
provinces also. The revocation of the partition led to the
formation of a province comprising areas with people
speaking a single language, in place of the earlier multi-lingual
province created for the sake of administrative convenience.
This, in turn, led to the creation of a sense of solidarity
among the people speaking other languages, which developed,
later on, into a general demand for a reorganization of
provinces on linguistic basis.

With the successful termination of the struggle against
the Bengal partition, a section of the people speaking the
Oriya language and who were till then in Bengal, and the
people of Bihar speaking Hindi became part of a new
province (Bihar and Orissa). The struggle also foiled the
plan of the British to split the Bengali-speaking people who
were till then in one province. A new province consisting
entirely of people speaking Bengali was formed. It was the
first monolingual province formed after the establishment
of British rule in India.

Similarly, the people of Andhra expressed the desire to
have a state of the Telugu-speaking people. The _Andhra
Mahasabha_ formed in 1911 for this purpose was the organization
which stood in the forefront of the agitation for
linguistic states in the country.

Even before this, the Congress, then led by the 'moderates',
had decided in 1906 to organize a separate provincial
committee for Bihar in accordance with its constitution.
Bihar was then administratively a part of Bengal. This
decision was made, apart from meeting the needs for organizational
activities, to help the Bengalis in their anti-partition
agitation. In effect, it also strengthened the desire of the
people of Bihar, Orissa and Andhra for their respective
linguistic provinces.

At this stage, the agitation for the formation of linguistic
states was in its primary form. It took nearly a decade for
this agitation to take a full and clear form. Even so, the formation
of a monolingual province of Bengal and the emergence
of linguistic provinces at least as a goal in Bihar and Andhra
constituted an important event in the national movement in
India. One of the sharp weapons that the British used against
the Indian patriots who declared national independence or
_Swaraj_ as their objective was the "disunity of the Indian
people". In India there were several castes, religions and
languages; it was the British who brought them under a single
government; if the British left the country, they would start
fighting each other as before --- this was the argument advanced
by the British.

A fitting reply to this was the growth of the national
movement and the development of the various national
languages as an integral part of that movement. And these
were precisely what unified the Indian people by raising their
consciousness on modernization and Indian nationalism above
caste, religious and linguistic considerations.

The _bourgeois_ democratic movements in India, including
those led by social reformers like Ram Mohan Roy and the
_Indian National Congress_ and its 'moderate' and radical
sections, accomplished two tasks simultaneously. First, they
gave rise to a pan-Indian movement which stood for the
modernization of Indian society and the liberation of India
from the British rule as their objectives. Second, as a part
of this, they published newspapers, periodicals and books in
different Indian languages and organized and addressed public
meetings and conferences. In this process, a new language
style was developed that suited these purposes.

The _bourgeois_ democratic movement raised the various
sections of the people speaking different languages to the
position of nationalities, each with specific national characteristics
of its own as an integral part of the Indian people
fighting for a common goal and with a common perspective.
That is, it became clear that the development of the consciousness
of solidarity among each of the different nationalities like
the Bengalis, Maharashtrians and so on, was not an obstruction
in the path of development of a common national consciousness
among Indians, but they were complementary to each
other. It is well known that except for Tamil and the 'dead'
languages like Sanskrit, Pali, etc., all other Indian languages
were evolved relatively recently. In the ancient period,
Sanskrit and several _Prakrit_ dialects were used in Northern
India. With the growth of Buddhism, Pali also rose to the
level of Sanskrit as scholars used it for literary purposes. In
Southern India, there were several dialects known as _Kodum
Tamil_ and _Sen Tamil_ during the same period. That is, both in
the North and in the South, there existed a literary language
used for scholarly and administrative purposes and several
vernaculars used by the common people.

This situation continued to exist until the last six or
seven centuries when standard literary works appeared in the
different vernaculars. One of the consequences of this was
that with the growth of vernaculars into literary languages,
scholars and poets began to emerge from among the people
of the lower castes, like Ezhuthachan and Kambar in the
South and Tulsidas, Kabir and so on, in the North. Thus developed
languages like Malayalam and Tamil in the South and
Hindi, Punjabi, Sindhi, Gujarati, Bengali, Assamia, and so
on in the North and North East as national languages. And the
old literary language _Sen Tamil_ transformed itself into a new
popular literary language by absorbing words and idioms
from dialects spoken by the common people.

But, there was a limitation inherent in the progress made
in this period. Although the language that came to be used
for literature were those of the common people, the content
of the new literature was religious. For example, Ezhuthachan,
Tulsidas, Kabir, Ramdas and others expressed the contents
of the works written in Sanskrit in languages understood by
common people. Therefore, the literary works of this period
spread only among the people of a particular religion. But,
whereas the works of Sanskrit scholars with religious
contents catered only to a small minority of the higher strata
of society, the new litterateur who emerged from the lower
castes spread the religious contents of these works among
the masses. This was, in fact, the contribution they made
to the growth of their respective languages.

But, the masses belonging to other religious groups had
no interest in this body of new literature. To them, they were
as distant as was the Sanskrit literature. That is, this literary
venture did not help the development of a new literature with
modern secular outlook that could be imbibed by all people
speaking the same language.

A change in this situation was brought about by the
_bourgeois_ democratic movements from the social reform
movement led by Ram Mohan Roy and others to the 'moderate'-'extremist'
political movements which assumed different
forms at different stages. It was at this stage that a literature
with contents which were of interest to all sections of the
people speaking the same language, irrespective of caste or
religious differences, and a style suited for this purpose
developed. The new Indian languages thus developed fostered
cultural and social solidarity among the people speaking
these languages above caste and religious considerations.
This solidarity and a body of literature which gave expression
to it, in fact, emerged through the efforts made to accomplish
the dual task of modernizing the Indian social system and
liberating India from _political slavery_. Along with unifying
each of the national groups on the basis of language and
culture, certain common goals and outlooks acceptable to all
of them were placed before the Indian people.

The Bengalis stood at the forefront in this process. They
were ahead of others in the movements for social reform and
cultural modernization as well as in political consciousness.
The '_Bengali Babu_' became a nightmare for the British
rulers. If they devised the plan to divide Bengal with the
intention of breaking the unity of the Bengalis, the nationalists
inside and outside Bengal conducted organized agitations
equally vigorously to spoil the goal of the British. Other
nationalities which sympathized with the agitation carried
on by the Bengalis found their own future in the anti-partition
agitations. That was why people in other parts of India as
well expressed their desire, though not in clear and strong
terms, to have linguistic provinces of their own.

But, the demand for linguistic provinces suffered from a
serious limitation at that time. The demand was then raised
only in relation to those parts of India which were known as
"British India". The nationalist leaders of those days could
not even imagine the incorporation of the _Princely States_[^princely-state] in
the linguistic provinces visualized by them.

[^princely-state]: A _Princely State_, also called a _native state_ (for those states in Indian subcontinent), was a vassal state under a local or indigenous or regional ruler in a subsidiary alliance with the British Raj.

Even the leaders of 'extremist' political orientation did
not think of changing the then existing authoritarian rule or
the borders of the _Princely States_. Some of them even regarded
the _Princely States_ as the model for _Swaraj_.

The agitation for linguistic provinces started with the
demand for the formation of Andhra for the Telugu-speaking
people. But, at that time, the leaders of the agitation
envisaged only the separation of the Telugu-speaking areas
from the existing composite _Madras Presidency_. A considerable
section of the people speaking Telugu resided in the
Telangana area of the _Princely State_ of Hyderabad. It took
another three decades even for the idea of "_Vishal Andhra_"
incorporating the Telangana region of _Nizam_'s Hyderabad
to emerge.

The Telugu-speaking areas of the _Madras Presidency_ alone
would have constituted a large state. Therefore, it was thought
practicable at that time to bifurcate the province into
"Andhra" and "residual Madras State". But, this was not
the case with the Malayalam and Kannada-speaking areas
of Madras. The Malayalam-speaking area in the Presidency
was just a district (Malabar) while the Kannada area was
made up of two or three districts which were not contiguous.
So, it was difficult to bring all of them together to form a
separate Karnataka province.

Moreover, a majority of the people speaking Malayalam
and Kannada was in the _Princely States_ --- the Malayalis
in Travancore and Cochin and the Kannada-speaking people
in Mysore and nearly a dozen other small _Princely States_.
Therefore, the demand for linguistic states assumed practical
relevance only when it was possible to abolish the _Princely
States_ altogether and reorganize the people, scattered over
different areas, on the basis of language.

We have seen that Maharashtra stood second only to
Bengal in the development of _bourgeois_ democratic movements.
But, there was no movement there for a separate
Maharashtra as in Andhra. The reason is the same as in
the case of Kannada and Malayalam-speaking people. Maharashtra
was part of Bombay Presidency in which there were
Gujarati and Kannada-speaking people as well. . A majority
of the latter two was, however, in the _Princely States_.
A section of the Marathi-speaking people was also in Marathwada
which formed part of _Nizam_'s Hyderabad. Thus,
to form separate states for the Marathi, Gujarati and
Kannada-speaking people, it was essential to liberate the
people from the autocratic regimes in the two large states of
Mysore and Hyderabad, and in about 300 small _Princely
States_ in Gujarat and over a dozen states in Karnataka, and
integrate them with the people in "British India". And this
was exactly what happened. In 1953--54 Madras province
was bifurcated into Andhra and the residual Madras State.
But, _Vishal Andhra_, _Aikya Kerala_, _Samyukta Karnataka_
and _Samyukta Maharashtra_ states were formed only in 1956 and thereafter, when the political atmosphere was created
to abolish the bigger _Princely States_ like Hyderabad,
Travancore, Mysore, Baroda, etc., and to unify the population
speaking different languages with their brethren in
other states.

Bengal was a state which did not leave such a problem.
There was not one _Princely State_ within the Bengali-speaking
areas. Moreover, till the partition of Bengal, the Bengali-speaking people were all within one state, which, however,
included the Biharis and the Oriyas. With the successful
culmination of the anti-partition struggle, the Biharis and
Oriyas were separated, leaving only the Bengalis in the new
province. This led to the question being raised among the
Telugu-speaking people as to why they should not be separated
from the _Madras Presidency_ to form a separate state,
since a separate state of the Bengalis had already been
formed by separating the Biharis and Oriyas from the
erstwhile composite Bengal.
