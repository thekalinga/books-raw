# NEGOTIATIONS AND COMMUNAL RIOTS

## THE BEGINNING OF PARTITION

The _Cabinet Mission_ arrived in India in March 1946. In
the next three months there were hectic discussions between
the Mission and the representatives of various political
parties and groups, particularly with the leaders of the
Congress and the _League_. Though not as part of the Congress
leadership, Gandhi also actively participated in the
discussions.

The talks were centred round a long-term scheme to
frame a constitution for India as well as a short-term
scheme to form an interim government at the Centre to carry
on the administration of the country till the adoption of the
constitution. From 1st to 17th April 182 discussion sessions
were held involving 472 political leaders. This many sessions
had to be arranged because separate interviews had to be
held with a number of organizations, apart from the Congress
and the _League_, claiming to represent different interests,
including several small parties without any appreciable popular
support and even organization which remained only on paper.

The members of the Mission left for Kashmir on 17th
April to evaluate the different views presented before them
during the interviews. Soon after their return on 24th April,
Pethick-Lawrence as the leader of the Mission addressed
separate letters to the Congress and the _League_ suggesting
one more attempt to obtain an agreement between these parties.
He also invited the representatives of the Congress and the
_League_ for a conference at Simla with a view to discussing
the possibility of agreement upon a scheme based upon the
following "fundamental principles":

>The future constitutional structure of the British India
to be as follows: A Union Government dealing with the
following subjects: the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Communications.
There will be two groups of provinces, the one of
the predominantly Hindu provinces and the other of the
predominantly Muslim provinces, dealing with all other
subjects which the provinces in the respective groups desire
to be dealt with in common. The provincial governments
will deal with all other subjects, and they will have all the
residuary sovereign rights.[^30/1]

[^30/1]: DG Tendulkar, _Mahatma_, Vol. 7, New Delhi, Publications Division
Government of India, 1962, p. 106.

Soon after receiving this letter, the Congress President
Azad sent a reply stating that the scheme was acceptable to
him and hoped that it would be acceptable to his Party too.
However, the members of the _Congress Working Committee_
were unaware of such a reply having been sent by Azad.
Consequently, the _Working Committee_ in a resolution stated
that it was difficult for the Congress to accept the scheme
suggested by the _Cabinet Mission_. The resolution also specified
its objections with regard to the scheme. The Mission
thereupon clarified that acceptance of the scheme was not a
condition for participation in the proposed conference. On
the basis of this clarification, the _Working Committee_ decided
to participate in the Conference. The _League_ also decided
to participate reserving the "freedom to accept or reject the
proposed scheme".

Accordingly, a week-long conference was held at Simla.
The Mission had already introduced certain changes in the
light of the earlier discussions to meet the objections raised
by the Congress and the _League_. It was this revised scheme
that was presented before the conference, However, even
this revised scheme was not acceptable either to the Congress
or to the _League_. It was decided to hold consultations between
Nehru and Jinnah to find if it was possible to leave matters
on which there was difference of opinion to arbitration and
in that case who should be the arbitrator. Since these consultations
also failed, the Second _Simla Conference_ broke down.

The Viceroy and the Mission claimed that they were
trying to bring conciliation between the Congress demand
of freedom and sovereignty for an undivided India and the
_League_ demand of two separate constitution-making bodies
for Pakistan and Hindustan.

It may be recalled that the _Communist Party_ had pointed
out that the only practical solution to the problem was to
set up a system with wide autonomy to the people speaking
different languages by treating them as separate nationalities
and a federal government at the Centre to deal with a limited
number of subjects like foreign relations, defence, communication,
etc. The nationalists at that time accused the
of encouraging "disintegration" of the country. However,
when confronted with the problems of framing a constitution
for the country, the Congress was forced to move along the
same way. The Congress leaders made it clear that they
were not against the _Cabinet Mission_'s proposal for dividing
the provinces into groups. But they forcefully opposed the
attempt to the forcible merger of a province in either of these
groups against its will. They demanded that after the adoption
of a constitution for India, each province should be
given the right to join either group of its choice.

The _League_ was totally opposed to it. They wanted a
separate constitution-making body for the Muslim majority
provinces of NWFP, Sind, Baluchistan, Bengal and Assam
to frame a constitution for a federal government of Pakistan.

In other words, the Congress stood for a federal constitution
for India with autonomous provinces and for the
right of the Muslim majority provinces within the Indian
federation to frame a common group constitution if they so
desired. The _League_, on the other hand, demanded the formation
of Pakistan comprising the Muslim majority provinces
with the right to any province to keep away from it only
after the adoption of a constitution for Pakistan. It was due
to the irreconcilability of these demands of the Congress and
the _League_ that the Second _Simla Conference_ broke down.

Soon after the conference, the _Cabinet Mission_ announced
its own proposals without introducing any basic change
in the proposals presented by the Mission before the conference.
These proposals included the following.

>1. There should be a Union of India, embracing both
>British India and the States, which should deal with the following
>subjects: Foreign affairs, Defence, and Communications;
>and should have the powers necessary to raise the finances
>required for the above subjects.
>2. The Union should have an Executive and a Legislature
>constituted from British Indian and State's representatives.
>Any question raising a major communal issue in the Legislature
>should require for its decision a majority of the representatives
>present and voting of each of the two major
>communities as well as a majority of all the members present
>and voting.
>3. All subjects other than the Union subjects and
>all residual powers should vest in the Provinces.
>4. The States shall retain all subjects and powers other
>than those ceded to the Union.
>5. The Provinces should be free to form groups with
>Executives and Legislatures and each group could determine
>the provincial subjects to be taken in common.
>6. The Constitutions of the Union and of the groups
>should contain a provision whereby any Province could by a
>majority vote of its Legislative Assembly, call for a reconsideration
>of the terms of the constitution after an initial period
>of ten years and ten yearly intervals thereafter.

If item 5 above was brought into operation, it was obvious
that the NWF Province and Assam which did not accept
the leadership of the _League_ could opt out of Pakistan. But
there was another provision contrary to this included in the
scheme. It was provided that the Muslim majority provinces
of NWFP and Assam would be included in two different
"Sections" comprising the Muslim majority provinces in
the west and the east, respectively, "which shall proceed
to settle the Provincial Constitutions for the Provinces included
in each section, and shall also decide whether any Group
Constitution shall be set up for those provinces. ... " and that
the provinces would have the power to opt out of the groups
in accordance with the provision that "such a decision shall
be taken by the new legislature of the Province after the
general election under the new constitution."

The Congress opposed these provisions and argued that
any province should have the right not to participate in the
meetings of the sections and that no province should be forcedbly
brought under a group. The _Working Committee_ pointed
out that the scheme prepared by the _Cabinet Mission_ was
ridden with contradictions in that in one clause it provided
the provinces with the right to opt out of groups while in another
it forcibly included them in groups. Therefore, the
_Working Committee_ gave the interpretation that the provinces
had the right not to participate even at the first meeting
of the sections. Accordingly, the Committee informed the
_Cabinet Mission_ that its scheme was acceptable subject to
this interpretation. However, the _Cabinet Mission_ pointed
out that this interpretation was wrong and clarified that the
provinces were bound to participate in the initial proceedings
of their respective sections.

In the light of this clarification, the _Working Committee_
of the _League_ accepted the scheme of the _cabinet Mission_ on
the ground that in the very provision which was criticized
by the Congress lay the foundation of Pakistan. As soon as
the _League_ declared its acceptance, the _Cabinet Mission_
announced that both the Congress and the _League_ had
accepted the scheme. But the Congress had accepted the
scheme only subject to its own interpretation of the
provision as stated above, which was, however, rejected by
Mission. The General Secretary of the Congress JB Kripalani
has put it in record that his argument that the
Mission's announcement of the acceptance of the scheme by
the Congress was contrary to facts was rejected by other
members of the _Working Committee_.

This was, in fact, the beginning of Gandhi and a section
of his disciples taking an attitude against the opinion of the
majority of the _Congress Working Committee_. The latter
were guided by the fear that unless the long-term scheme
was accepted, the short-term scheme would not come into
operation. They feared that if the Congress did not participate
in the formation of the interim government, the antiCongress
forces including the _League_ would form the
government creating a political situation which would be
most dangerous to the Congress. Consequently, they were
prepared to deviate a bit from their own principled stand
with regard to the long-term scheme to avoid this danger.
Gandhi's disciples were of the opinion that this amounted to
presenting the provinces like the NWFP and Assam and also
the entire national Muslims throughout the country who had
been resisting the pressures from the British rulers and the
_League_ and opposing a demand of Pakistan, as a gift to the
_Muslim League_. They were not afraid of the anti-Congress
forces forming a government, because they had with them the
instrument of _satyagraha_ which could be used in all circumstances.
It was with this view that Gandhi proposed to the
_Cabinet Mission_ to invite Jinnah to form a government at
the Centre.

If Gandhi and his disciples had gone ahead with this
stand challenging the majority of the _Congress Working
Committee_ and rallied the people against the scheme of the
_Cabinet Mission_, it would have changed the course of Indian
politics. For, an _anti-imperialist_ people's upsurge which was
conducive to this change was taking shape in the country
since the end of the War. This upsurge of revolutionary
struggles had been steadily gaining in strength while the discussions
with the _Cabinet Mission_ were going on. Large
sections of the people including workers, peasants, the
_intelligentsia_, students and the youth, and the people of the
_Princely States_ were entering these struggles with great
enthusiasm. These broad sections of the people were not
affected either by the _Congress-League_ conflicts or the quarrels
between the Hindus and Muslims. If Gandhi and his
followers were prepared to lead these people, a broad mass
upsurge would have developed throughout the country on an
unprecedented scale.

But Gandhi and his followers were not prepared for it.
As ever before, they were led more by the neglect and opposition
on their part to revolutionary struggles than by
_anti-imperialism_. Consequently, they left the majority of
the _Working Committee_ alone by merely expressing dissent
to the decisions taken by them.

## _LEAGUE_ TOWARDS '_DIRECT ACTION_'

Both the Congress and the _League_ tried equally well
during the discussions with the _Cabinet Mission_ to turn the
short-term aspect of the scheme (_i.e._, formation of an interim
government) to their advantage, while adhering to their respective
stands on the framing of the future constitution.

The _Cabinet Mission_ declared that the Viceroy would
take steps to form an interim government with the participation
of the representatives of the Congress and the _League_ with
powers of all the subjects including Defence, if these two
parties accepted the long-term aspect of the scheme with
regard to constitution-making. That is, acceptance of the long-term
aspect of the scheme was an essential condition for the
participation in the interim government. That was why the
Congress accepted the scheme with their own interpretation
and by the _League_ without any interpretation of their own.
Accordingly, the _Cabinet Mission_ and the Viceroy decided
that it was time to start discussion on the interim government.

In the third week of June the Viceroy asked the Congress
to suggest the names of six Hindus, including a representative
of the Scheduled Castes, and the _League_ to suggest the
names of five Muslim members to the proposed interim
government. He had also informed them that, in addition
to these 11 Hindu and Muslim members, there would be three
more members in the government representing the Sikh,
Christian and Parsi communities. Accordingly, the Congress
and the _League_ submitted their lists and the Viceroy
accepted the list of the _League_ but struck off the names of
Sarat Chandra Bose, Dr. Zakir Hussein and Rajkumari
Amrit Kaur from the Congress list. Since the latter two
belonged to Muslim and Christian communities, he refused to
accept them in the Congress list. The Viceroy insisted that
all the representatives of the Congress including the Scheduled
Caste representative should be caste-Hindus.

This was objected to by the Congress. It also took
objection to the inclusion of Abdur Rab Nistar who had
been defeated in the 1946 elections in the _League_ list which
was accepted by the Viceroy. The Congress was also opposed
to NP Engineer, who was the public prosecutor in the _INA
trial_, being included in the list representing the Parsi
community.

Gandhi was clearly opposed to Congress participation
in such an interim government. In a letter drafted by him
on behalf of the _Congress Working Committee_ and intended
to be sent to the Viceroy, Gandhi placed particular emphasis
on the following points.

>1. Since the _League_ was openly a Muslim organization,
>no non-Muslim should be included in the _League_ list of
>members of the interim government.
>2. Since the Congress was a national organization, its
>list could include Muslims.
>3. Except in the case of five members allotted to the
>_League_, it should not have the right to express opinion on the
>selection of anyone else.
>4. The interim government should be responsible to
>the elected members of the Central Assembly.

The _Working Committee_, however, did not even consider
this draft letter. Although the _Working Committee_ was
not in agreement with the list prepared by the Viceroy, it was
not willing to reject it. The Committee thought it's possible
to eliminate the ill-effect of the alterations made by the
Viceroy in the Congress list.

But the _Working Committee_ had a firm opinion with
regard to the right and status of the interim government.
The Congress was not prepared to make compromise on the
principle that the interim government should be able to
function as a government of a free, sovereign country without
interference from the Viceroy. On 30th May, President
Azad wrote a letter to the Viceroy to this effect. Azad received
a favourable reply from the Viceroy stating that the
interim government would be treated with considerations
given to a _Dominion government_. With this, the _Working
Committee_ on 18th June took a tentative decision to accept
the proposal of the _Cabinet Mission_ with regard to the interim
government. It did not, however, communicate this
decision to the Viceroy.

The decision to accept the proposal with regard to the
interim government, however, widened the difference that
had existed within the Congress leadership. For example,
Kripalani has stated that Sardar Patel had become angry
when he said that, whatever be the decision of the _Working
Committee_, he would resign his position in the Congress, if
it approved of the scheme to compulsorily merge some of the
Muslim majority provinces in Pakistan against their wishes.
On 19th June, Gandhi told the members of the _Working
Committee_ in clear terms that if the Committee gave approval
to a list which did not include a national Muslim and
which included N. P. Engineer, he would have nothing to
do with it.

In the meantime, an incident took place which was likely
to wreck the entire decision of the Congress with regard to
the acceptance of the scheme of the _Cabinet Mission_. The
contents of a letter which Jinnah had sent to Wavell appeared
in the _Statesman_. In that letter Jinnah sought from Wavell a
number of assurances with regard to the interim government,
which were not at all acceptable to the Congress. Soon after,
the Congress President demanded from the Viceroy a copy of
Jinnah's letter as well as his reply to Jinnah. The reply contained
an assurance that no change in principle in the list of
members of the interim government would be made without
the approval of both the Congress and the _League_. The
meaning of this was clear. A national Muslim should not be
included in the Congress list without the permission of the
_League_. Besides, the selection of the representatives of the
minority communities including the Scheduled Castes would
also require the approval of the Congress and the _League_.

In addition to giving this assurance to Jinnah, the Viceroy
informed the Congress President on 22nd June that it
was not possible to include a national Muslim in its list.
Thereupon the _Congress Working Committee_ decided against
participation in the interim government subject to this condition.
It may be stated that Maulana Azad did not agree
with this decision --- another instance to show that the difference
within the Congress leadership was getting sharper.

The Congress decision against participation in the interim
government brought the work of the _Cabinet Mission_
to a deadlock. As the final effort to resolve the crisis, the
Mission invited Gandhi and Sardar Patel for a talk. During
the talks, differences of opinion between Gandhi and Patel
surfaced even on the question of the approach the Mission
had adopted in the talks.

Gandhi emphatically stated that he was suspicious about
the Mission's long-term and short-term schemes and that
he was not in agreement with the acceptance of the schemes.
Following, the _Working Committee_ declared its rejection of
the Viceroy's proposals with regard to the interim government,
but stated at the same time that it accepted the long-term
scheme of the _Cabinet Mission_ with its own interpretation.

According to Jinnah, this meant rejection of the _Cabinet
Mission_'s long-term scheme by the Congress. Since his
Party had accepted the scheme, he expected the formation of
an interim government without the Congress. But the _Cabinet
Mission_ maintained that if the Congress and the _League_
were not prepared to join the interim government, the entire
scheme for constitution-making would fail. Besides, the
Mission interpreted the decisions of the Congress and the
_League_ as if both had accepted its proposals unconditionally.

As the Congress has rejected the proposal with regard
to the formation of an interim government, the _Cabinet
Mission_ decided not to proceed with its scheme and left
India leaving the Viceroy to hold discussions on the formation
of the interim government and to take steps to form the
constitution-making body. This made the _League_ leadership
highly discontented. They demanded that since the question
of forming the interim government had been deferred, the
steps being taken to form the constitution-making body also
should be put off. When the British Cabinet refused to concede
this demand, Jinnah accused the Cabinet of "bad faith",
The _League_ also decided to withdraw its acceptance of the
_Cabinet Mission_'s scheme and to resort to "_direct action_"
to achieve its objective of Pakistan.

Now it was the first time in the history of the _League_
that it was renouncing the constitutional method of struggle
and contemplating _direct action_. This had far-reaching consequences
in Indian politics as can be seen in the following
chapters. Here it is worth noticing the fact that hitherto
only one section of the Indian _bourgeois_ leadership (_i.e._, the
Congress) had resorted to the method of open mass agitation
as an integral part of the politics of bargain. For the Congress,
the final form of _direct action_ was reached in 1942.
They were now engaged in the final stage of the bargain
making use of the popular support they had gained in the 1942 struggle. It was at this stage that another section of
the _bourgeois_ leadership (_i.e._, the _League_) was resorting
to the method of _direct action_. While the Congress had
been engaged in _direct action_ to achieve _swaraj_, the _League_
was now resorting to _direct action_ to achieve Pakistan. The
_League_ also decided to observe 16th August as '_Direct Action
Day_' which together with the events that followed the observance
the Day changed the entire course of the political
history of India.

## KASHMIR

While the Congress and the _League_ leaders were engaged
in discussions with the _Cabinet Mission_, the problem of the
place of the _Princely States_ in the future constitution of India
had started coming to the fore. The attitude of the British
government towards this problem was thoroughly undemocratic.
The relationship between 'British India' and the
_Princely States_ was governed by a treaty entered into between
them. Consequently, in the event of the British relinquishing
power in India, the _Princely States_ would become free. The
British government had been maintaining that the states had
the right to decide their own future.

The _League_ had never openly expressed an opinion about
it. Their only concern was the place of the Muslims as a
community in India's future constitutional set-up. The attitude
of the Congress was different. They wanted to establish
democratic rule in the _Princely States_ as well as in British
India. This was not merely because they were more committed
to democracy than the _League_; establishment of
democracy in the _Princely States_ was essential for them to
keep in their proper place those forces which were opposed
to them in the future constitutional set-up of the Indian
Union. If the representatives of the _Maharajas_ of the
states happened to go to the Central Assembly and the cabinet,
there was a possibility of them joining hands with the
representatives of communal and caste politics facilitating the
British vested interests to continue their dominance in a new
form. It was therefore natural for the Congress to extend
its support to the demand for ending the autocratic rules in
the states.

However, as we have seen earlier, the Congress was
never prepared to help without reservation the struggles for
_responsible governments_ in the _Princely States_ and to give these
struggle a revolutionary character. In the earlier days, the
Congress kept away from these struggles in accordance with
the policy of "non-interference in the internal affairs of the
_Princely States_". Later, when organizations like _Praja Mandals_
and state Congress started emerging in the states, _Congressmen_
came forward to occupy leadership positions in these
organizations. However, they looked upon the mass agitations
in the states as a means to bargain with the rulers of the states.

The discussion on India's future constitutional set-up
which started with the First _Simla Conference_ gave an
added strength to the agitations for _responsible governments_
in the _Princely States_. The movements in certain states like
Travancore, Cochin, Hyderabad and certain states in Orissa
were under the leadership of leftists. Even in those states
where they were not in leading positions, their influence in
the movement was evident. Particular mention must be made
in this connection of Kashmir in which a majority of the
population was Muslim and the _Maharaja_ a Hindu. Consequently,
the early form of the movement for _responsible
government_ in Kashmir had the characteristics of Muslim
politics. Started in the name of '_Kashmir Muslim Conference_',
the movement transformed itself into '_National Conference_',
via '_Muslim Conference_'. Its leaders like Sheikh Abdullah
and GM Sadiq came under the influence of left-wing
nationalism and Socialist-Communist ideologies. They engaged
themselves in the task of rallying the people irrespective
of their religious affiliations against autocracy and landlordism.
Thus, the _National Conference_ became part of the
left front comprising Communists, Socialists and left-wing
_Congressmen_ in British India.

These developments before and during the war influenced
the post-war politics in Kashmir, strengthening the movement
for _responsible government_ there. Following the slogan
of '_Quit India_', the _National Conference_ raised the slogan
of '_Quit Kashmir_',meaning thereby that the _Maharaja_ should
_quit Kashmir_ and transfer power to the people.

The democratic movements in no other Indian state had
raised such a radical slogan with far-reaching consequences.
The demand raised in most other states was confined to the
establishment of a government responsible to an elected legislative
body with the _Maharaja_ remaining as the formal head
of the state. The significance of Kashmir was that, as distinct
from this, a native organization representing _bourgeois_ nationalism
came forward to raise the demand of ending the
rights of the _Maharaja_.

An equally significant feature of Kashmir was the
communal character of the leadership of the _National Conference_.
It was a mass organization comprising people of all
communities with a leadership composed of the representatives
of all communities under the overall leadership of Sheikh
Abdullah who belonged to the Muslim community. The very
existence of such an organization constituted a challenge to
the _League_'s 'two-nations theory'. The only organization matching
to this was the mass movement led by Abdul Ghaffar
Khan in the NWF Province, which was a source of constant
irritation to the _League_. Consequently, the democratic movement
in Kashmir appeared as a problem which was in a sense
connected with the discussions at the _Simla Conference_ and
with the _Cabinet Mission_.

The Kashmir problem worsened when the talks with
the _Cabinet Mission_ were in progress. The _League_ leadership
made an attempt to get the _National Conference_ merged in
the _League_ with a view to strengthen their bargain with the
Congress and the _Cabinet Mission_. But it did not succeed.
Like the Khan Brothers in the NWF Province and the national
Muslims elsewhere in the country, the _National Conference_
took a firm stand against Muslim sectarianism. As its
slogan was '_Quit Kashmir_', the _Maharaja_ and his government
started taking actions against it. Leaders of the _National Conference_,
including Sheikh Abdullah, were arrested. The Sheikh
was arrested while he was on his way to Delhi to meet and
hold discussions with Nehru who was then the president of the
_All-India States People's Conference_. This provoked Nehru
who proceeded to Kashmir, but he was also arrested on his
entry into the state. The situation was brought under control
by the intervention of the Viceroy and the Indian government,
on the one side, and the _Congress Working Committee_, on
the other.

This was a shining example of the attitude of the British
government and that of the rulers of the _Princely States_ as
well as the leaders of the Congress and the _League_ towards
the problems of the states. The _Maharaja_ tried to suppress
the democratic movements in the state by putting under arrest
even Jawaharlal Nehru who was widely known to become the
prime minister of the country within the next few weeks.
Neither the Viceroy nor the British government did anything
worthwhile to dissuade the Kashmir government from taking
such repressive actions. The Viceroy who suggested the Kashmir
government to avoid Nehru's arrest and to postpone the
trial of Sheikh Abdullah received a reply from the _Maharaja_
offering to "abdicate and his prime minister to resign if the
Government of India compelled them to take no action against
Jawaharlal". Thereupon the Viceroy withdrew his suggestion.
It was only after the arrest of Nehru that the trial
of Sheikh Abdullah was adjourned and Nehru brought back
to Delhi at the instance of the Viceroy, the _Cabinet Mission_
and the _Congress Working Committee_.

It is worth noticing that the _Muslim League_ was completely
indifferent to the Kashmir issue. The _National Conference_
accepting the general political outlook of the Congress
and under the leadership of a national Muslim who had been
maintaining relations with Nehru, had been irritating to the
_League_ and its leader, Jinnah. But they were helpless. They
were placed themselves in a position in which they were unable
to protest against the actions taken even by a 'Hindu ruler'
against such an organization like the _National Conference_
and its leaders. On the other side, the leaders of the Congress
which had been characterized by the _League_ as a Hindu
political party had been coming forward to protest against
the repressive actions of this Hindu ruler. Although this was
contrary to the 'two-nations theory' of the _League_, it could
not have taken any other stand in the background of the
bargain with the British and the Congress in which it had
been engaged.

On the other hand, although the Congress and Nehru
acted in a manner helpful to the _National Conference_, they
found that the only way to solve the Kashmir problem
was through consultations with the Viceroy and the _Cabinet
Mission_. Nehru's biographer has stated that on hearing the
news of the arrest of the Sheik:

>his (Nehru's) first impulse
was to leave Simla to Kashmir to support his friends, but
he curbed himself so as to give the Viceroy a chance to
intervene and not to worsen the situation by disobeying any
restraining order which might be served on him. ... By the
middle of June, Jawaharlal felt he had waited long enough
and decided to enter the State. ...[^30--1/1]

[^30--1/1]: S. Gopal, _Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography_, Vol I, Bombay, Oxford
University Press, 1976, p. 322.

He added that:

>it was
the adjournment of the trial of Sheikh Abdullah and the insistence
of the _Working Committee_ which led Jawaharlal to
return to Delhi on the clear understanding that he would be
back in Kashmir[^30--1/2]

[^30--1/2]: _Ibid_, p. 323.

The Kashmir incident was only one of the events which
had been taking place in the _Princely States_ all over India.
Following the efforts made by the leftist organizations to
link the mighty struggles of workers, peasants, government
employees and other sections of the people that were going
on across the country with the people's movements in the
_Princely States_, these movements had begun to take a revolutionary
form. Some of these movements took a still higher
form as that of Punnapra-Vayalar and Telangana.

The movement in Kashmir under the leadership of the
_National Conference_ also had taken a revolutionary form.
The '_Naya Kashmir_' programme formulated by the
_National Conference_ had been considerably influenced by the
ideologies of Communism and Socialism. However, the
partition of India and the developments that followed caused
the democratic movement in Kashmir to deviate from this
path and made it a problem preparing the ground for
disintegration of India. The British rulers, the _Muslim League_
(later the rulers of Pakistan) and the Hindu communalists all
alike utilized the democratic movement based on secularism
and the '_Naya Kashmir_' programme as part of the Hindu-Muslim
problem which was later turned into an India-Pakistan
problem.

The Congress, though it had adopted an approach
relatively more democratic and secular, regarded, on the
other hand, the problems of the _Princely States_, including
that of Kashmir, as a part of its bargain with the government
and the _Muslim League_. The dreadful results of this
attitude adversely affected the future not only of Kashmir,
and other _Princely States_ but also of the entire country.

## BEFORE AND AFTER THE CALCUTTA RIOTS

We have noted earlier that the _League_ had unconditionally
accepted the long-term scheme of the _Cabinet Mission_.
They regarded the provision contained in the scheme to
group the provinces into sections with the right to every
section to decide by majority votes the future of the provinces
included in the respective sections would lead to the
formation of Pakistan. The Congress, on the other hand,
accepted the long-term scheme subject to its own interpretation
of this provision. The _League_ leaders maintained that
the acceptance of the scheme by the Congress with interpretation
was, in fact, a rejection of the scheme and accused
the _Cabinet Mission_ of hiding this fact.

As we know, the essence of the short-term scheme of
the _Cabinet Mission_ was the formation of an interim government
at the Centre with the representatives of the parties
accepting the long-term scheme. Thus, the leaders of the
_Muslim League_ thought that the interim government would
be formed including the representatives of the _League_ which
had accepted the long-term scheme but excluding the Congress
which had rejected the scheme. They also thought they
would be able to utilize such a political situation to strengthen
their activities for the formation of Pakistan. But the _Cabinet
Mission_'s declaration that both the Congress and the
_League_ had accepted its long-term scheme dashed their hope.

When the problem of the formation of interim government
came up, it became necessary for the Congress to
introduce certain changes in the organization. Nehru took
over the presidentship from Azad. Subsequently, the _AICC_
which met at Bombay in July ratified the _Working Committee_'s
resolution accepting the long-term scheme of the _Cabinet
Mission_ with the interpretation that the provinces irrespective
of which section they were placed in would have the right
of autonomy. Besides, in the speech he made as the Congress
President, Nehru rejected _League_'s interpretation and
declared that neither the British government nor the _Cabinet
Mission_ had the right to impose limitations on the sovereignty
of the _Constituent Assembly_. This angered the _League_
leaders. The efforts made by the British government to appease
them also failed. The Council of the _League_ which met
at Bombay on 27th July decided to resort to the method of
'_direct action_' in protest against the attitudes of the Congress
and the British government. A resolution adopted by the
Council called upon the Muslims to renounce forthwith the
titles conferred upon them by the "alien government". In
the words of Jinnah, "never have we in the whole history of
the _League_ done anything except by constitutional methods
and by constitutionalism. But now we are obliged and forced
into this position. This day we did goodbye to constitutional
methods." Jinnah said that the British and the Congress had
been holding pistols in their hands, the former the pistol of
authority and arms and the latter that of mass struggle and
_non-cooperation_. "Today we have also forged a pistol and
are in a position to use it."

The council directed the lower units of the _League_ to
organize processions and public meetings as part of the observation
of the '_Direct Action Day_' on 16th August to explain
the _League_ stand on the scheme of the _Cabinet Mission_. Although
it was suggested that the observance of the _Protest Day_
should be peaceful, it turned out to be the beginning of
terrible events (Hindu-Muslim riots) to come.

Meanwhile, certain developments took place before the
observation of the _Direct Action Day_, which gave it an added
impetus. The Viceroy had been taking steps with regard to
the formation of an interim government in accordance with
the short-term scheme of the _Cabinet Mission_. He presented
before the Congress President Nehru and the _League_ President
Jinnah a proposal to form a 14-member interim government
with six Congress members (including one Scheduled
Castes member), five _League_ members and three representatives
of other minority communities including one Sikh.
But since the _League_ had withdrawn its acceptance of the
long-term scheme of the _Cabinet Mission_ when it decided to
resort to _direct action_ and also since the Congress had already
declared acceptance of it, the British government had taken
a decision to form the interim government without the
representation of the League. Accordingly, the Viceroy sent
a letter to the Congress President Nehru inviting him to form
an interim government. In the same letter the Viceroy indicated
that he would appreciate Nehru reaching an agreement
with Jinnah and asked him to consider whether he should
discuss the matter with Jinnah before submitting his
proposals in this regard. In reply to this Nehru stated that
he would approach the _League_ and urge their cooperation if
a public announcement was made to the effect that he had
been invited to constitute an interim government and that he
had accepted the invitation. Accordingly, an announcement
was made on 22nd August.

This announcement naturally angered the _League_ leaders.
Consequently, they carried out vigorously the observation
of the _Direct Action Day_. The observation of the Day in
Calcutta deserves particular mention. The _League_ government
of Bengal declared 16th August a holiday. In the background
of extremely provocative speeches and other forms of
agitation adopted by the _League_, the action of the provincial
government created a situation of great tension in Calcutta.
The observation of '_Direct Action Day_' culminated in
mass killings and other acts of violence. Although an accurate
account is not available, it has been generally admitted that
about 5000 people were killed and 15,000 seriously injured.
Human corpses piled and blood spilled all over the streets.
Among the killed were women and children. Hindus, Muslims
and Sikhs were all among the victims of violence.

Even while these brutal acts were going on, the provincial
government did not take any action to put down the
violence. The Governor who was particularly responsible for
the maintenance of "law and order" did not move either. He
stuck to the attitude that he would not do anything unless
asked by his ministers. The military was called in only after
the massacre which lasted for about 48 hours. And within
a few hours after that all violent activities were stopped and
the situation brought under control.

This brief description of events clearly demonstrates
the role played by the _Muslim League_ and the British
authorities in the outbreak of the Calcutta riots. Through the
"direction action day" observation, the _League_ tried to
create the impression that it was capable of creating the kind
of 'mass force' that the Congress was able to forge through
consistent efforts made during the past quarter of a century.
And the _League_ ministry of Bengal tried to convert it into
the beginning of the politics of communal riots. The British
Governor was not prepared either to dissuade them from this,
or to curb the riots with the help of the military. It was a
warning to the effect that, like the Congress, the _League_ also
was capable of forging the weapon of '_direct action_' and that
if the _League_ ventured to do it, the entire country would be
thrown into a civil war.

The _League_ organized these riots against the Hindus
and the Congress. At that stage, the victims were mostly the
Hindus. As it was found that the ministers and the Governor
who were responsible for putting down the riots were not
acting in that way, the Hindus and the Sikhs also started
resorting to violence. Among those who were killed and
injured at the stage, there were many Muslims. The riots
spread to other places too. In Noakbali (now in Bangladesh)
the victims of the riots were the Hindus, while in Bihar and
other places the victims were the Muslims. Thus, the Calcutta
riots led to a series of communal riots in many parts of
the country.

These riots were reflected in the moves being made to
form the interim government. The Viceroy who had taken
steps to form an interim government under the leadership
of Nehru, now started exerting pressures on him to teach an
agreement with Jinnah with a view to bring the _League_ in the
interim government. He reminded Nehru that the exclusion
of the _League_ from the interim government would only help
to spread the communal riots all over the country.

Meanwhile, a new ministry (Executive Council) had
taken office on 2nd September. On the very next day, Sir
Shafaat Ahmad Khan, a member of the cabinet, was stabbed.
The attack on him was an expression of wrath of the followers
of the _League_ for allowing his name to be included in
the list of Congress members in the proposed ministry. This
further worsened the situation and also helped the Viceroy
to exert more pressure on Nehru to placate the _League_ and
change the composition of the ministry. Finally, on 15th
October, Sharat Chandra Bose, Shafaat Ahmad Khan and
Syed Ali Zaheer resigned from the ministry to make room
for the _League_ nominees in the ministry. Subsequently, Liaquat
Ali Khan, Chundrigar, Abdur Rab Nishtar, Glazanfar
Ali Khan, and Jogendra Nath Mandal joined the ministry
representing the _League_, Mandal, belonging to the Scheduled
Castes figured in the _League_ quota because Azaf Ali, a
Muslim, was included among the Congress nominees in the
ministry! Thus, the entry of the _League_ in the ministry sharpened
the _Congress-League_ quarrel.

The explanation offered by the _League_ for deciding to
join the ministry is significant to note. They considered that
the entire Central administration remaining under the control
of the Congress was detrimental to the interests of the Muslim
and other communities. Further, the presence of certain
individuals in the ministry who did not command the confidence
and respect of the Muslim community would have
serious repercussions. Jinnah wrote to the viceroy that the
_League_ was joining the ministry to avoid these problems.

In other words, the entry of the _League_ in the ministry
was a continuation of the communal riots raging on the
streets of Calcutta and in the villages in Noakhali, Bihar
and other places. Two mutually competing parties in the
government and two communities cutting the throat of each
other in the streets and in the fields --- this was the situation.
The entire Indian politics had entered a new and more dangerous
stage.

## THE "GREATEST TEST"

The Conflicts that occurred inside the interim government
as well as those outside before its formation marked
the beginning of the process of partition of India. All these
were known to the public. Certain other developments also
were taking place not so publicly during the same period.
Although most people could not perceive the significance of
these developments at that time, they had a lot to do with
the politics of Indian Union which emerged out of the
partition.

We have noted earlier that Nehru had taken over the
Congress presidentship from Azad while the discussions
with _Cabinet Mission_ were in progress. Consequently, the
Viceroy invited Nehru as the Congress President to form
the interim government. However, evidence had come to
light later to indicate that things might have developed in a
different way. JB Kripalani, then the General Secretary
of the Congress, stated:

>The _Working Committee_ meeting held in Calcutta from
>December 7 to 11, 1945 decided to hold the session of the
>Congress in the first week of April 1946. Proposals were
>invited by the _AICC_ office for the election of the president.
>... Three names were duly proposed by the provinces --- those
>of Sardar Patel, Pattabhi and mine. Jawaharlal's
>name had not been proposed.
>
>Gandhiji had earlier expressed a wish that at that juncture
>Jawaharlal should be the President. What reasons impelled
>Gandhiji to recommend his name were not mentioned, so
>far as I remember. The final date of the proposals to be
>received by the _AICC_ was drawing near. Only fifteen
>members of the _All-India Congress Committee_ are required
>to propose the name of the President. A meeting of the
>_Working Committee_ was being held in Delhi a few days
>earlier. I sent a paper round, proposing the name of
>Jawaharlal. The members of the _Working Committee_
>signed it and also some local members of the _AICC_. It
>was thus that the name of Jawaharlal was proposed for
>the presidentship. The others thereupon withdrew their
>names. It was certain that if Jawaharlal's name had not
>been proposed, the Sardar would have been elected as the
>President. The Sardar did not like my intervention. I have
>since wondered if, as the General Secretary, I should have
>been instrumental in proposing Jawaharlal's name in
>deference to Gandhiji's wishes in the matter. But I did
>not think that the matter was of very great importance.
>The President of the Congress is the Chairman of the
>_Working Committee_. He is first among the equals. No
>important issue can be decided except by the Working
>Committee. Also, I do not think that independence, in
>whatever form it might come, was round the corner.
>thought that we had many more struggles ahead. But who
>can forecast the future? On such seemingly trivial accidents
>depend on the fate of men and even of nations.[^30--2/1]

[^30--2/1]: JB Kripalani, _Gandhi: His Life and Thought_, New Delhi, Publications
Division, 1970, pp. 248--249.

Kripalani indicates that if he had not proposed Nehru's
name to the presidentship at the instance of Gandhi, Sardar
Patel would have been called upon to form the interim government
as the Congress President. Although Patel and other
members of the _Working Committee_, as the loyal colleagues
of Gandhi, approved of Nehru outwardly as the head of
the interim government, they were unable to approve of this
choice at heart. As the _League_ ministers left the interim
government following the partition, the friction between
Nehru and Patel became intense. It continued till the death
of Patel.

This was hardly a problem of rivalry between Nehru
and Patel alone; it was the beginning of factionalism and
conflicts at the top level of the Congress. The faction fight
appeared again when a new president had to be elected following
the resignation of Nehru as the president consequent
upon his selection as the head of the ministry in the interim
government. Azad, Pattabhi Sitaramayya and Kripalani
were the candidates to fill the post of the president. When
it appeared that Kripalani was most likely to get elected to
the liking of Gandhi and Patel, many Congress leaders, including
Nehru, approached Gandhi requesting him not to
approve of Kripalani's candidature. Nevertheless, Kripalani
was elected president of the Congress.[^30/2]

[^30/2]: _Ibid_, pp. 250--251.

Briefly speaking, while a wild controversy was raging
between the Congress and the _League_ on the question of
India's partition, a serious factional fight was developing
within the Congress itself. The contents of both these conflicts
were of the same nature. The main question underlying
the _Congress-League_ conflict was whether India should be kept
united or should be divided into two in order to share the
political power which was going to be obtained in the near
future. The conflict within the Congress, on the other hand,
was over the question of who should occupy the top position
in the Congress which was going to wield political power.

Although this was a new development at the Central
leadership level in the Congress, it was not a new phenomenon
in the Congress organization taken as a whole. Right in 1937
when Congress ministries took office in the different provinces,
disputes started at the provincial level over berth
in the ministries. The war and the _Quit India Struggle_ put
an end to these disputes for the time being, But when the Congress
ministries again came to power in the provinces following
the elections in 1946, the disputes reappeared in the provinces.
When the gulf between the ministerial and organizational
wings widened on the one side, disputes arose on the other
side as to who should be the leader of each of the two
wings. The developments that took place in the second half
of 1945 only showed that this dispute spread to the Central
leadership when the time came to form the interim government.

These developments naturally perturbed Gandhi. But
more perturbing developments were taking place in the different
parts of the country. The communal riots which started
in Calcutta spread to Noakhali and from there to Bihar.
Details of the attack on the members of the minority Hindu
community in eastern Bengal had been coming in. In one of
his prayer meetings, Gandhi announced that Congress President
Kripalani would go to Noakhali and stated that if
necessary he himself would visit Noakhali and die there. Accordingly,
Kripalani accompanied by his wife, Sucheta Kripalani,
and a group of Congress leaders left for Noakhali.
They collected details of the ghastly happenings and consoled
the victims of these acts and rendered them different kinds of
assistance. Following, Gandhi himself left for Noakhali.


Meanwhile, communal riots had spread to the Hindu
majority province of Bihar. While the Noakhali killings
were organized to avenge the attack on the Muslims at a
certain stage during the Calcutta riots, the attack on the
Muslim minority in Bihar was organized to avenge the
attack on the Hindu minority in Noakhali. Pained deeply
by these happenings, Gandhi wrote to Patel: "My _non-violence_
is being tested here in a way it has never been tested
before."

As reports from Bihar started pouring in, Gandhi felt
the desire to leave Noakhali and go to Bihar. He felt that
being a Hindu it was his duty to leave Noakhali where the
Hindus were being attacked and go to Bihar where the Muslims
were facing the same fate. However, certain Muslim
leaders advised him that his presence in Bihar was not an
urgent necessity since other leaders from Delhi had arrived
there and that it would be better if he continued his work
in Noakhali. So, he stayed back.

This was the beginning of the activities in which he was
going to engage himself in the next several months. Gandhi
had been staying in the capital city of Delhi to assist other
Congress leaders in their discussions with the British authorities
on the transfer of power. He felt deeply disturbed by
the fact that the Congress leaders who were considered to
be his loyal disciples were not working according to his
advice. He saw for himself that Nehru, Patel, Rajagopalachari
and other top leaders were eager to get hold of power
by any means. Further, they were fighting among themselves
over the sharing of the political power after its transfer to
the Congress. Above all, there was the problem of the country-wide
communal riots. He described this as "the most
complex and difficult problem which he had to face in his
life."

The (Congress) organization which he was able to build
through consistent efforts for a quarter of a century had
begun to crack. The leaders who had been engaged in selfless
service to the people had now begun to engage themselves
in factional struggles over the sharing of power. On the
other side, the Hindu and Muslim communities were brutally
attacking each other in such a way as it appeared impossible
to ever realize the goal of Hindu-Muslim unity and friendship
which he had been consistently advocating. In the
circumstance, Gandhi thought that his place of activities was
not the capital city but in the villages of East Bengal and
Bihar where people belonging to the two communities were
killing each other and that his work was not to advise and
assist the Congress leaders in their discussions with the
British government on the transfer of power, but to solace and
assist those who fell victim to communal riots. Thus, while
Nehru, Patel, Rajagopalachari and other disciples of Gandhi
began to wield power as ministers, Gandhi took up the work
of saving the people from the horror of communal riots as
the last mission of his life.

As we shall see in the following chapters, the gulf
between Gandhi and the leaders who were known to be his
disciples was widening. Two groups were emerging: a ministerial
group playing all kinds of tactics with a view to
acquire political power as early as possible, on one side, and
Gandhi and his closest associates feeling disturbed by the
sight of these manoeuvres and engaged themselves in implementing
_constructive programmes_, including _communal unity_.

How did this happen? How did the Congress which
was considered to have been built on the principles of _non-violence_
and self-less service to the people turn itself into a
centre of rivalries for political power? How did the ideology
of communal unity ceaselessly propagated for about a quarter
of a century get destroyed in this manner? Gandhi was unable
to find answers to these questions. But he had recognized the
truth that such a situation had emerged. This was what distinguished
him from other Congress leaders.
