# THE _CONGRESS-LEAGUE_ RELATION

## THE FAILURE OF NEGOTIATION ATTEMPTS

The political situation changed as Gandhi and some of his
associates were released from detention. It became clear
that negotiations between the Congress and the government
would start soon. The leaders at the lower levels who remained
outside the jail started organizational work of
different kinds. The question came up whether Gandhi and
the Congress approved of the "violent activities" that
took place as part of the _Quit India Struggle_. The British
authorities adhered to the position that Gandhi and his
colleagues were responsible for the troubles and that they
would not enter into talks with them unless they renounced
the programme.

The leaders outside the jail denied the charge and argued
that the programme they envisaged in 1942 was _non-violent_
as it was the case with all the earlier struggles. However,
the ordinary activists who were active during the 1942
struggle did not agree with this. They believed that whatever
incidents occurred in connection with the struggle, including
those which were called "violent" were correct and were
fully in accord with the call given by Gandhi.

This problem acquired added importance in the eyes of
the people after Gandhi's release from detention, since both
sides presented their arguments invoking his name while he
was in the jail. Now since he had come out of the jail, he
himself had to make it clear what the fact was. And he did
make clear a few days after his release. Gandhi stated unambiguously
that he had adhered to _non-violence_ when the
August resolution was adopted by the Congress. He emphasized
that since his call "_do or die_" was not meant for a
violent struggle, he had no sympathy at all to the violent
activities that took place as part of struggle. However, Gandhi
was not prepared to condemn those who were engaged in
these activities, for what led to the outbreak of violence on
the part of the people was the brutal repression let loose by
the government. Thus, Gandhi rejected the demand of the
authorities either to condemn those who indulged in the
violent activities or to approve of these activities. While keeping
those who were engaged in activities which may be called
"violent" with the Congress, Gandhi rescued the Congress
from the responsibility for the violent activities.

Gandhi was facing yet another serious problem. The
August struggle had been suppressed and there was no question
of its revival. Hence, it had become necessary to start
negotiations with the authorities in one form or another. At
the same time, the struggle could not be formally withdrawn
in the background in which quite a large number of activists
including the entire _Working Committee_ were in jail. In the
circumstances the question arose as to how the second anniversary
of 9th August should be observed. Gandhi advised
the _Congressmen_:

>. ... mass _civil disobedience_ cannot be offered
now. But mass disobedience is one thing and individual
action in the sense of self-respect and liberty is wholly
another. It is a universal duty for all time, the discharge of
which requires no sanction, save that of one's own conscience.

Further, he advised those who had gone underground
to "discover themselves... by informing the authorities of
their movements and whereabouts." He also enjoined every
one to spin and carry out other _constructive activities_ on 9th
August. Thus, Gandhi's policy was to maintain the popular
support which was required to conduct negotiations with the
authorities.

Meanwhile, he had started moves in the direction of
negotiations. Soon after he was released form detention he
held discussions with _congressmen_ at the different levels and
wrote a letter to the liberal leader M.R. Jayakar on 20th
May in which he said:

>The country expects much from me. I am not at all
happy. I feel even ashamed. I should not have fallen ill.
I tried not to, but failed at length, I feel that they will
imprison me as soon as I am declared free from the
present weakness. And even if they do not arrest me, what
can I do? I cannot withdraw the _August Resolution_. As
you have very properly said, it is innocuous. You may
differ about the sanction. It is the breath of life for me.[^27/1]

[^27/1]: D, G. Tendulkar, _Mahatma_ Vol. 6. pp. 250--251.

This letter was not intended for publication, but it was
published. The rulers properly utilized Gandhi's statement
that he could not withdraw the August Resolution. They
interpreted that Gandhi was determined to continue the _Quit
India Struggle_.

But that was not the truth. Gandhi only indicated that
he could not withdraw the resolution and the struggle in his
individual capacity and that it had to be collectively decided
by the Congress. In some of the letters he had sent from
the jail he had expressed his eagerness to take a collective
decision in this regard. But none of them turned out to be
effective. Now he was trying to find if it was possible to start
negotiations through the liberal leaders like Jayakar and
Sapru. When this effort also became ineffective, he wrote
directly to the Viceroy on 17th June:

>Though there is little cause for it, the whole country and
even many from outside expect me to make a decisive
contribution to the general good. I am sorry to say my
convalescence threatens to be fairly long. Even if I am
quite well, I could do little or noting unless I know the
mind of the _Working Committee_ of the Congress. I
pleaded as a prisoner for permission to see them. I plead
now as a free man for such permission. If you will see me
before deciding, I shall gladly go wherever you want me to,
as soon as I am allowed by my medical advisers to undertake
long distance travelling.[^27/2]

[^27/2]: _Ibid_, p. 251.

Gandhi was undoubtedly knocking at the door of the
authorities again to start negotiations with them. Similar
efforts made on earlier occasions had often been fruitful
and often fruitless. The present attempt also turned fruitless.
The Viceroy Lord Wavell in his reply dated 22nd June
stated:

> I feel a meeting between us at present could have
no value and could only raise hopes which would be disappointed.
If after your convalescence and on further reflection,
you have a definite and constructive policy to propose for
the furtherance of India's welfare, I shall be glad to consider.[^27/3]

[^27/3]: _Ibid_, p. 251.

Wavell also wrote that the same considerations also
applied to Gandhi's request for permission to meet the
members of the _Working Committee_. He reminded Gandhi
of his "recent declaration of loyalty to the _Quit India Resolution_"
which he considered both unjust and impracticable.
Thus, the negotiation attempt failed once again. The Viceroy's
letter was an expression of the government's attitude that
the rulers were not prepared to have a discussion with
Gandhi as long as he was not ready to unconditionally
withdraw the _Quit India Resolution_. Nor would they allow
a discussion between Gandhi and Congress leaders. In this
exchange of correspondence can be found a continuation of
the moves made by both the sides immediately before and
after the adoption of the _Quit India Resolution_. Gandhi maintained
that it was impossible to take a decision either on the
resolution or on the struggle in any manner other than as a
first step of a negotiation which may be decided upon collectively
by the _Working Committee_. The Viceroy maintained, on
the other hand, that there was no question of a negotiation
without first withdrawing the resolution and the struggle.
These positions were irreconcilable with each other. However,
the Viceroy was conscious of the fact that the path of negotiation
had to be taken eventually. That was why he
expressed readiness to consider a "definite and constructive
policy" that Gandhi might propose "on further reflection
for the furtherance of India's welfare".

Behind the differences of opinion which found expressed
in the letters exchanged between the two sides lay the
evaluation of the political realities of those days made by
each side. Gandhi had come to realize that since the _Quit
India Struggle_ had been suppressed, negotiations would have
to be conducted with the authorities and the struggle withdrawn
as part of the negotiations without negatively affecting
the organized strength of the Congress. The course of the
war had also turned in favour of Britain and the final defeat
of Germany and Japan had started to appear immanent. In
the circumstances, the 1942 approach of starting a struggle
to prepare the ground for negotiations had lost its relevance.

As for Britain, even if victory was achieved over Germany
and Japan, India could not be taken back to the prewar
situation. When the war ended, a new situation would
emerge which would make a negotiated settlement with
Indian leaders including Gandhi and other Congress leaders
inevitable.

In other words, both Gandhi, the spokesman of the
_bourgeois_ leadership represented by the Congress and the
Viceroy, the representative of the British rulers, were preparing
grounds for an imminent bargain. Gandhi made his own
moves to conduct the bargain in a situation most favourable
to the leadership of the Indian _bourgeoisie_ which he represented.
Lord Wavell, on the other hand, was striving to
protect as best as possible the British vested interests in the
process of the transfer of power which was imminent. Each
side proposed immediate steps necessary to preserve its own
interests in accordance with its long-term perspectives.

In addition to the British rulers and the Congress, there
was also the _Muslim League_ on the political scene upholding
the interests of the minority communities in general and
those of the Muslim community in particular. The _League_
which was only one among the Muslim organizations before
the war had now transformed itself into a party representing
a majority of the members of the Muslim community. The
British rulers readily came forward to accept at least partly
its demand for the formation of Pakistan and its 'two nations
theory'. It was in recognition of this reality that
Gandhi tried to establish contact and negotiate with the
_League_ even while he was exchanging letters with the British
authorities. To some extent these attempts were successful.
Gandhi met Jinnah and personally held discussions with
him. But as we are going to see in the section that follows,
these discussions did not turn out to be successful.

## _GANDHI-JINNAH_ TALKS

We have noted earlier that while in prison, Gandhi had
expressed the desire that the Congress and the _League_ must
consult with each other and take a unified stand on the
future of India. Since the government had stood in the way
of his efforts to contact Jinnah, he had to wait till his release
from prison to proceed in that direction.

Meanwhile, Rajagopalachari had launched an extensive
campaign placing emphasis on the need to arrive at an
understanding between the Congress and the _League_. He
had also put forward a certain proposal conceding the
_League_'s demand while maintaining the fundamental unity of
India to the extent possible. Gandhi's release from prison
and the failure of his efforts to establish contact with the
Viceroy had naturally led him to think the way Rajagopalachari
had been visualizing.

In addition to Rajagopalachari, many organizations unrelated
to both the Congress and the _League_ and certain eminent
individuals had also suggested talks between Gandhi and
Jinnah. It was, in fact, the main contention of the _Communist
Party_ in its campaigns. All of them were of the opinion
that a solution to the _Indian problem_ could be found only if
Gandhi and Jinnah came to an understanding with each
other. Accordingly, on Gandhi's initiative they met in
September 1944. Gandhi initiated the talk on the basis of
Rajagopalachari's proposal which in effect conceded the
demand raised by the _League_. The main features of the
proposal were as follows.

After the end of the war, a commission would be set
up to determine the contiguous districts in North-West and
North-East India in which the Muslims were in an absolute
majority and in the areas thus demarcated a plebiscite of
all adults would decide whether or not they should be separated
from Hindusthan. If the people in these areas decide
to remain as a sovereign country separate from India, that
decision would be brought into force. But, the people in the
border districts will have the right to decide which country
they should join.

Although this proposal was in effect an acceptance of
the demand of the _League_, it did not satisfy the _League_
leaders, because the right to secede from India was subject
to a plebiscite. Besides, the plebiscite was to be held not in
the Muslim majority provinces but in districts. Furthermore,
the people in the border districts would have the right to join
either country as they liked.

There was another noteworthy provision contained in
Rajagopalachari's proposal. It was proposed that in the
event of a division of India, the two countries would sign a
pact with regard to defence, commerce, transport and other
essential services, meaning thereby that the governments of
the two countries would function in cooperation with each
other even after the partition. This provision was allergic to
the _League_. For these reasons, the _League_ denounced the
proposal in strong terms. Jinnah described it as "the shadow
and outer shell of Pakistan; a wounded, mutilated and moth-eaten
Pakistan". The mouth-piece of the _League_, the Dawn,
suggested that the principle of two independent sovereign
countries should first be accepted and that once it was accepted,
the borders should be demarcated by including in
Pakistan as much areas as needed to make it economically
viable. Thus arose a situation in which direct talks between
Gandhi and Jinnah were not likely to bring about a settlement.

Yet the Indian people looked upon the talks with great
expectations. The masses, though divided into the different
communities, hoped that these two great leaders would together
give shape to the future of India based on Hindu-Muslim
unity. The _Gandhi-Jinnah_ talks were given wide
publicity by the newspapers, without understanding the meaning
of the contents of the talks though.

However, the talks ended in great disappointment. The
leaders ended where they began. The differences between
them did not narrow down at all; they, in fact, widened.
The target of Jinnah's criticism was not the contents of the
proposal but Gandhi's efforts to maintain the unity of India.
Gandhi's contention was that India had an individuality of
her own and that she was a big family of which the Hindus,
Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and so on were members. Jinnah
was fundamentally opposed to this idea and held that the
Muslims did not only constitute a minority community, but
they were a separate nation. Based on what was known as the
'two-nations theory', he visualized Pakistan as a completely
independent and sovereign country.

After the talks broke off, Gandhi said that he was not
at all agreeable to India's partition. Jinnah was, on the other
hand, jubilant. He told a press correspondent that Gandhi
had "taught him the meaning of Pakistan". He said that to
Gandhi's question if the defence and foreign policies of
Pakistan would be opposed to India's, he had to simply say
"yes".

Another important issue came up in the midst of the
talks: Whom did Gandhi and Jinnah represent? Gandhi
argued that he represented the Indian people as a whole and
even a considerable section of the Indian Muslims. Jinnah,
on the other hand, argued that he was the sole representative
of the Muslim community and that Gandhi represented
only the Hindus. This created a big commotion in the country.
The masses rallied behind the Congress, _Hindu Mahasabha_ and other organizations believed that Jinnah and the
_Muslim League_ were an obstruction before Indian independence.
Campaigns to this effect were carried on extensively
throughout the country. The Muslim masses rallied behind
the _League_ blamed Gandhi who refused to accept the demand
raised by the _League_ and Jinnah for the failure of the
talks. Thus, the talks which ought to have led to communal
unity prepared the ground for communal frictions.

Rajagopalachari and others who spoke of the need to
have talks between Gandhi and Jinnah went on repeating the
same. They desired the differences to be narrowed down and
a settlement reached between them. But things did not move
in that direction. On the contrary, the differences led not
only to the partition of India but also to communal clashes
which took the lives of several thousands.

How did things come to such a pass? Since different
answers have been given to this question, it is necessary to
recapitulate the developments that took place ever since the
emergence of the question of Muslim communal representation
as described in the preceding chapters.

1. The ideologies and movements of modern nationalism
   developed in India with the growth of the _bourgeoisie_ in the
   country. The _Indian National Congress_ emerged and developed
   as an organization representing these ideologies and
   movements.
2. In the development of the _bourgeoisie_, the Muslims
   as a community was backward as compared to other communities.
   However, retarded its growth, it also gave shape
   to ideologies and organizations of _bourgeois_ nationalism with
   its specific characteristics. Thus, a few decades after the formation
   of the Congress, a political organization of the Muslim
   community, the _Muslim League_, emerged.
3. In the progress of Indian politics following this, the
   Congress and the _League_ developed in parallel. The _League_
   rose as an organization capable of consolidating the Muslim
   community by challenging both the British government and
   the Congress in proportion to growth of the capability of
   the Congress to fight for Indian independence by challenging
   the British.
4. The provincial ministries constituted after the 1937
   elections and the war which broke out in 1939 strengthened
   both the Congress and the _League_. The Congress ministries
   that remained in office for about two and a half years and
   the agitations conducted following the resignation of the
   ministries which culminated in the _Quit India Struggle_ broadened
   the mass base of the Congress. Similarly, the continuation
   of the _League_-led ministries in certain provinces after
   the resignation of the Congress ministries and the agitations
   for Pakistan which went in parallel with the _Quit India Struggle_
   increased the strength of the _League_ several folds. When
   the _Quit India Struggle_ was suppressed and the efforts of
   Gandhi to move in the direction negotiations failed, the balance
   of power between the Congress and _League_ turned in
   favour of the latter.
5. As a result of all this, in 1943--44 the _League_ was politically
   in a more favourable position than the Congress.
   Rajagopalachari's proposal and the talks Gandhi held with
   Jinnah on the basis of this proposal were, in fact, a recognition
   of this political reality. Jinnah tried to make the best use
   of this favourable position to achieve his objective.
6. The economic reality that underlay the political growth
   of the _League_ needs particular mention. The _bourgeois_ class
   which emerged within the Muslim community continued to
   grow at an accelerated pace during the war. The formation
   of ministries led by the _League_ in Bengal in which was situated
   one of the important industrial centers, and in the strategically
   important province of Punjab helped the growth of the _bourgeoisie_
   among the Muslims. Having thus tasted political
   power in the provinces, they became convinced of the absolute
   need to have a central government under their control.
   They began to perceive that a sovereign state including the
   full control over defence and foreign policies was necessary
   for their further development, rather than two states cooperating
   with each other as proposed by Rajagopalachari.
7. Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the real symbol of the
   growth of this new _bourgeois_ class. Started as a liberal in the
   early days of Indian politics, he, unlike other leaders of the
   Muslim community, worked for the interests of the entire
   Indian _bourgeoisie_ until the _Round Table Conferences_. This
   liberal political leader who was the most ardent nationalist
   of all the leaders of the Muslim community finally turned
   himself into the best representative of Muslim sectarianism,
   who gave the call for a _direct action_ on its behalf. This change
   in Jinnah's political life can be evaluated only in the light of
   the constant growth of the _bourgeois_ section among the
   Muslims and the _resultant_ conflicts between the Muslim and
   non-Muslim _bourgeoisie_.

Many eminent personalities like Rajagopalachari and
political parties like the _Communist Party_ did not take into
consideration this historical reality while looking upon the
_Gandhi-Jinnah_ talks as a divine cure for the _CongressLeague_
conflicts. That was why the talks held with great
expectations disappointed them.

## PAKISTAN AND THE NATIONAL PROBLEM

Although the _Communist Party_ was among those who
wanted Gandhi and Jinnah to reach a settlement between
themselves, the approach of the Party towards the demand
for Pakistan was different from that of others. Leaders like
Rajagopalachari thought that since it was impossible to
confront the British rulers without a settlement between the
Congress and the _League_, it was necessary to accept in part
the _League_'s demand and create an atmosphere for cooperation
between the two sectors into which India might be
divided. It was because of this that Rajagopalachari proposed
to hold a plebiscite in the contiguous districts and
to make provisions for co-operation with regard to the
administration of defence and so on in the event of a division
of the country. The aim was to solve the political problems
arising out of Hindu-Muslim disputes.

The Communists were not examining the future of India
within the narrow confines of the Hindu-Muslim problems.
They had understood that the fact that the people of India
belonged to different religions was only one aspect of the
political reality of India. They drew the attention of the
people to an equally important fact, the fact that the population
of India was composed of different nationalities
speaking different languages, each with its own specific socio-cultural
life and that each such nationality was further
divided into different religions and castes. This was the
political reality to which the _Communist Party_ pointed.

The Indian National leadership had accepted this reality
at least to an extent. Consequently, as the Congress began
to develop as a mass movement, the provincial Congress
committees were organized on the basis of provinces demarcated
on linguistic considerations, rather than on the basis
of the provinces artificially created by the British rulers. These
considerations had reflected on their understanding with
regard to the future Indian administrative set-up. However,
their approach in this regard was partial and inadequate. If
the idea of linguistic province had to be brought into practice,
the distinction between British India and native (princely)
states had to be eliminated and the people speaking the same
language had to be brought into one province. This entails
an uncompromising fight against the autocratic rules in the
_Princely States_ and redistribution of the composite provinces
like Bombay and Madras and the _Princely States_ like Hyderabad
on linguistic basis. The Congress was prepared to do neither
of these. The Communists, on the other hand, demanded
implementation of the concept of linguistic provinces in its full
sense. In this the Communists were aided and led by the
Leninist perspective of nationalities. As explained by Lenin
and Stalin, development of _Capitalism_ leads to the development
of nationalities with linguistic and cultural homogeneity
and economic and political identity. The old composite
states and empires disintegrate and in their place emerge new
nationalities with their own states and nations.

This was what had happened in the 19th century Europe
and the same process would take place in India and in other
Asian countries in the 20th century. The tendency of the formation
of linguistic provinces as an integral part of the _bourgeois_
national movement in India and the encouragement it received
from the Congress were perceived by the Communists
as a manifestation of this historical reality.

Viewed form this perspective, it can be seen that neither
the _League_'s demand for Pakistan, nor the slogan of indivisibility
of India raised by the nationalists including Gandhi
and Rajagopalachari were in correspondence with historical
realities. It would be clear that both Jinnah's theory that
Hindus and Muslims constituted two nations and the argument
of Gandhi and others are untenable. The problem can
be solved neither by the formation of two nations of Hindusthan
and Pakistan as demanded by Jinnah nor by preserving
the indivisibility of India as demanded by Hindu nationalists.
The Communists pointed out that the concept of Indian independence
would be complete and clear only if it was accepted
that in India there were different nationalities each of which,
divided among different religions though, was united in linguistic
and social life and that the future administrative set-up
of India had to be devised by offering opportunities for the
free development of each of these nationalities. They also
pointed out that the Indian people composed of different
nationalities were politically united for historical reasons.
United, artificially though, under the British rule, the struggle
against the British rule consolidated the national unity of the
Indian people. The continuance of the national unity which
emerged through the _anti-imperialist_ struggle would help the
further progress of the people after independence. Standing
united in the post-independence national reconstruction, in
building a new democratic progressive India, would help the
development of each of the nationalities.

However, if the national unity which began to get
strengthened during the _freedom struggle_ had to be consolidated,
the concept of linguistic province had to be provided
with a new revolutionary content. The existing provinces
and _Princely States_ had to be reorganized into linguistic provinces
with maximum autonomy. The Communists analyzed
the political future of Indian on this perspective while a
clash was taking place between Jinnah's 'two-nations theory'
and the 'one-nation theory' of the non-Muslim nationalists.
They presented the problem in the form of a solution to the
problems that arose out of this clash. So, the people naturally
thought it as one that supported the demand for Pakistan.

The political set-up visualized by the Communists was,
in fact, fundamentally different from the idea of Pakistan.
They refused to distinguish between "Hindu India" and
"Muslim India" on the basis of religion. They pointed to
the fact that even if India was to be divided as demanded by
the _Muslim League_, the resulting two countries would have
to face complex nationality problems.

Later events have proved the correctness of this analysis.
Pakistan which was considered indivisible was divided into
two resulting in the emergence of a separate sovereign republic.
In the residual Pakistan, the Beluchis, Pathans and the
Sindhis began to fight against Punjabi domination. In India
fierce clashes took place on the questions of official language
and languages of education. In both India and Pakistan the
problems of nationalities created explosive situations.

This, however, does not mean that the approach of the
_Communist Party_ towards Pakistan was free form errors.
For one thing, the Communist had been campaigning in those
days in such a situation as would have helped, at least indirectly,
the argument of Jinnah that the Hindus and Muslims
were two nations. The Party did not endeavour to expose
sufficiently forcefully and uncompromisingly the _League_
stand that borders between the two countries should be
determined on the basis of religion. This enabled the opponents
of the party to make propaganda that it helped the demand
of the _League_ for Pakistan and the subsequent partition of
India. The impression spread even among the friends of the
Party that Pakistan was the manifest form of the Leninist
theory of nationalities.

The Party's approach had suffered from another and a
more serious weakness. It failed to imbibe the truth in its full
sense that Rajagopalachari who prepared the ground for the
_Gandhi-Jinnah_ talks, Gandhi who initiated the talks on the
basis of his proposals, and Jinnah who skillfully utilized these
talks and the series of events that followed were all _bourgeois_
political leaders striving to bargain with the British
rulers and protect their own class interests. The Party's
campaigners and journals tried, as Rajagopalachari and
other national leaders did, to present the _Gandhi-Jinnah_ talks
as a divine cure for the disease that had afflicted India,
The Party failed to expose the politics of bargain practised
by the leaderships of both the Congress and the _League_ by
strengthening the morale of those among the ranks of the
independence movement who were opposed to compromise
and by unifying them. The Party also failed to give sufficient
warning to the people on the political developments that
were to take place in the next few years.

In a few years after the _Gandhi-Jinnah_ talks two
mutually contradictory forces appeared on the Indian political
scene, the revolutionary social forces fighting uncompromisingly
against the British rulers and the autocratic rulers of the
_Princely States_ and against all other vested interests on the one
side and the native bigwigs trying to protect their own class
interests by continuously bargaining with the British government
and the different political parties in India on the other.
The Communists ought to have firmly stood with the former
forces. It was the demand of the latter that Gandhi and
Jinnah must together find a solution to India's national problems.
The main weakness of the approach of the _Communist
Party_ was that without sufficiently understanding the full
import of this demand, it supported in effect the approach
of the politicians of compromise.

Nevertheless, the _Communist Party_ made invaluable
contribution to Indian politics by campaigning among the
people that India was a multi-national country and that
the unity of India could be maintained only under the condition
of free development of all the nationalities. The
activities of the Communists in that period led later to the
emergence of powerful movements like the '_Aikya Kerala_',
'Vishala Andhra', '_Samyukta Maharashtra_', etc., for the redistribution
of provinces and the _Princely States_ on linguistic
basis.

It must be stated that in each of these movements there
emerged different views and tendencies, as a result of which
contradictions developed in them. Each of these movements
had been considerably influenced by narrow _bourgeois_
nationalism leading to clashes and disputes over borders
between neighbouring nationalities. The Communists were
able to stand firmly against these wrong tendencies because
they had been trying right in 1944--45 to examine the problems
of nationalities in India as a fight against imperialism and
_feudalism_ and for democracy. The theoretical and practical
work conducted by the Party in those days laid the seeds to a
number of movements and struggles like the _tebhaga_ movement
in Bengal, the _Telangana struggle_ in Andhra, and the
_Punnapra-Vayalar struggle_ in Kerala in the later years.

## THE DESAI-LIAQUAT TALKS

The failure of Gandhi's attempt to start negotiation
with the Viceroy and the _Gandhi-Jinnah_ talks that went
parallel to it had brought the Indian politics to a dead end.
In the meantime, the World War had reached its final stage.
With the Soviet counter-attack from the east and that of the
Anglo-American forces from the west, Germany had been moving
to the final defeat. After the defeat of Germany,
Japan would not be able to hold out for long. The question
came up before the Viceroy's government in India and the
British government in England as to what had to be done
after the war came to an end. The situation was such that
something had to be done without waiting for the end of the
war.

Viceroy Lord Wavelland the Secretary of State LS Amery
were in full agreement over the point that while steps would
have to be taken to transfer power to Indians soon after the
termination of the war, the interests of the British capitalists
in India and those of Indian _bourgeois_-landlord classes had
to be protected to the extent possible and that in preparing
the plan to transfer power, the Hindu-Muslim problems and
the _Congress-League_ conflicts had to be skillfully utilized. But
where to begin? On this question there were two opinions.

Wavell suggested that a government be constituted at
the Centre with the participation of the Congress and the
_League_ and the ministries in the former Congress majority
provinces be revived. If this was done first then only the
final stage of the war could be fought effectively. He also
suggested that this was necessary to deal with the famine and
other economic problems in the country. The government
which would thus be constituted should also create the necessary
set-up for framing the future constitution of India.
The Wavell Plan also envisaged equal representation for
Hindus and Muslims and one representative each for the
Scheduled Castes and the Sikh community in the Central
ministry. The Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief would
also be members of the ministry.

The Secretary of State for India, Amery, did not agree
with this plan. Would the _League_ have the right to nominate
all the Muslim members ? What was meant by equal representation
for the Hindus and the Muslims? He also doubted
if the ministry would not get paralyzed if members of mutually
irreconcilable parties were nominated to the ministry.
Amery therefore suggested the formation of a body with
representation to all parties except the Congress and the
_League_ to frame the future constitution.

Wavell, on the other hand, was of the opinion that any
scheme by excluding the Congress and the _League_ would
not correspond with reality. Meanwhile, Amery suggested
that the British government should declare that since the
_Dominion Status_ had been granted to India, the British
Parliament would no longer enact legislation for India. This
was in a way an acceptance of the slogan of '_Quit India_'.

However, neither Wavell's or Amery's scheme was
accepted. On account of the difference of opinion between
the two, the British government remained indifferent.

During the same period, a committee had been appointed
by a number of non-party political leaders under the leadership
of Sapru and with the backing of Gandhi to examine the
problems relating to India's future administrative set-up. In
April 1945, the committee submitted its report in which it
proposed: formation of a national government at the Centre,
creation of a constitution-making body with equal representation
for Muslims and Hindus except the Scheduled Castes,
general constituencies for all communities in place of
separate constituencies for Muslims, Christians and others,
refrain from partitioning India, implementation of only those
decisions of the constitution-making body which obtained a
three-fourths majority.

Those proposals became the target of opposition from
both the Muslim and non-Muslim political leaders. The
opposition of the _League_ was against the provision for general
constituencies. The non-Muslim political leaders opposed the
provision for equal representation for Hindus and Muslims.

While the deliberations of the Sapru Committee were
going on, another important development was taking place.
We are referring here to the talks held between the Leader
of the Congress Party in the Central Assembly Bhulabhai
Desai and Liaquat Ali Khan, the Deputy Leaders of the _Muslim
League_ Party in the Central Assembly, and to the proposals
that emerged from these talks. The talks took place in such
a way that it was difficult to say exactly what had happened.
The Congress and _League_ spokesmen had different stories
to say. The then General Secretary of the Congress stated:

>At the instance of the Viceroy, in January 1945, it is
believed Bhulabhai had talks with Liaquat Ali to find
_ways and means_ to end the deadlock and pay the way for
the formation of an interim national government consisting
of the members of the Congress and the _League_ in the
Central Assembly, Bhulabhai met Liaquat Ali, and they
discussed the proposal for forming the national Government
under the 1935 Act, consisting of an equal number of
members of the Congress and the _League_. The representatives
of the minorities would be inducted into the Cabinet
by mutual consent. Though such a Government, when
formed, would function within the framework of the 1935
Act, it was to be clearly understood that any measure not
passed by the Assembly would not be enforced by the
Governor-General under his special powers. But if the
Governor-General sought to interfere, the Government
would resign. Bhulabhai asked Liaquat Ali if this agreement
had been seen and approved by Jinnah. He answered
in the affirmative. Gandhiji bas cautioned Bhulabhai to
be careful and to get everything in black and white and
signed. However, Bhulabhai in his eagerness to bring
about a settlement did not quite take these precautions.
The result was that, though there was a draft of the agreement,
it was afterwards discovered that Liaquat Ali had
not initialled the copy that was with Bhulabhai. Later,
Liaquat Ali declared that there was no agreement and that
he had not consulted Jinnah. Thus, this effort failed.[^27/4]

Liaquat Ali had another story to tell. According to him,
Bhulabhai Desai met him after the winter session of the
Central Assembly and informally discussed with him the
economic and other problems being faced by the people in
the war-time situation. In the midst of this talk, Desai asked
him what the _League_'s opinion would be towards forming an
interim government at the Centre. Liaquat explained the attitude
of the _League_ in the light of the resolutions adopted by
the _League_ from time to time and told him that the _League_
was prepared to examine any proposal that might come with
a view to resolve the complex problems of the day. Desai met
him again in January and handed him certain draft proposals
with regard to the formation of an interim government at
the Centre. Desai asked him to keep the proposals strictly
confidential and told that efforts would be made to make
changes in the structure of the Central government on the
basis of the draft proposals. According to Liaquat Ali,
Desai told him that he would meet the Viceroy and Jinnah
in this connection. In Liaquat's opinion, these proposals
were worth forming the basis for a discussion, but in order
to proceed in that direction, Gandhi himself had to handle it,
or it should have his approval and open support, because in
the absence of the _Working Committee_, he was the only
person who could speak on behalf of the Congress. Liaquat
made it clear that this was his personal opinion and
not that of the _League_. He advised Desai that if he felt that
he could speak authoritatively on behalf of the Congress, he
should meet the _League_ President, Jinnah.

Despite these divergent versions, it is clear that both the
Congress and the _League_ were in a state of mind to utilize
every opportunity to arrive at a settlement between themselves.
Gandhi was not opposed to the efforts being made
by Bhulabhai Desai. He only wanted things to get a definite
shape in the form of a clearly worded document signed by
the parties concerned. In the eyes of Kripalani, the fault
of Bhulabhai was that he did not follow the advice of Gandhi
in this regard. Liaquat, on the other hand, only wanted
either Gandhi or Bhulabhai himself representing the Congress
to meet Jinnah. He advised Bhulabhai that a formal discussion
between the Congress and the _League_ should be conducted
by the authentic spokesmen of the respective parties.
In other words, the difference of opinion was not on the
contents of the draft proposals presented at the discussions,
but on the procedure of the discussions. Both sides were
eager to find a solution to the political deadlock.

Generally speaking, the proposals which attracted the
leaders of both the Congress and the _League_ and which they
wanted to handle carefully were based on the proposals
suggested by Lord Wavell. For these proposals also included
a new interim government at the Centre with equal representation
for the minority communities like the Scheduled
Castes and the Sikhs,membership of the Commander-in-Chief
in the Cabinet and so on. It was also proposed that as soon
as the formation of the ministry, members of the _Congress
Working Committee_ should be released from prison. The
essence of the proposals was that the Congress and the
_League_ were prepared to participate in the proposed set-up.

The leaders of the Congress and the _Muslim League_
understood that these proposals, if accepted and implemented,
would increase their strength. The Congress would not
only regain the ministries in the provinces which it had
lost following the outbreak of the war but also would
become a partner in the Central ministry. For the _League_,
it would gain the recognition as a party equal to the Congress,
which could be utilized to work more vigorously to
achieve Pakistan.

However, neither of them could accept these proposals,
for each of them wondered how the other side would utilize
the new situation in the event of implementing these proposals.
Gandhi suspected if this was not the first step towards the
formation of Pakistan. The _League_ leaders, on the other
hand, suspected Bulabhai Desai conducting the negotiations
while Gandhi remaining in the background. Above all, both
sides suspected if the proposal would be of any use in the
background in which a majority of the _Congress Working
Committee_ members remained in jail and the British attitude
towards Indian problems remained unchanged. This was
how the talks broke off.
