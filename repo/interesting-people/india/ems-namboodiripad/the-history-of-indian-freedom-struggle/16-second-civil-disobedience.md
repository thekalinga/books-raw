# _SECOND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE_

## TOWARDS CONFRONTATION AGAIN

After the _Round Table Conference_, Gandhi reached
Bombay on 28th December 1931. Even before that, the
political situation in India had already become tense. The
government had started moving in a direction of confrontation
with the Congress soon after the return of Gandhi.

It may be recalled that Gandhi had earlier cancelled
his journey to London in view of the mounting tension in
Bardoli, UP and NWFP. It was following certain oral
understanding reached between him and the authorities on
these issues that he decided to proceed to London.
These understandings, as pointed out earlier, were not very
firm. Once it was realized that the trend of the _Round
Table Conference_ was against the Congress, the government
began to tighten its grip on all issues. Of course, the Congress
leaders and the authorities of the concerned provinces
were carrying on continuous correspondence and discussions,
but the top officials of the government haughty and proud of
their success in rallying the minority communities against
Gandhi at the _Round Table Conference_ were making the
situation worse by not allowing a single issue to be solved
in a reasonable way.

The Viceroy had given an assurance to Gandhi that an
enquiry would be conducted into the tax arrears in Bardoli.
Accordingly, a high official had been assigned with the job.
The famous lawyer Bhulabhai Desai was appointed to
represent the Congress. Besides, Vallabhbhai Patel was there
to give him the necessary guidance in the matter. But from
the very beginning of the enquiry it became clear that the
enquiring officer was putting all types of obstructions against
the Congress collecting evidence. At every stage, the Congress
lodged its protest against the behaviour of the official,
but continued to take part in the enquiry. But soon the
situation became such that it could no longer continue its
co-operation and consequently withdrew from the enquiry.
Thus, the relation between the Congress and the government
ended in a visible rupture on this issue.

The situation in UP was much more serious. As pointed
out earlier, the main issue there was the rent due to the
big landowners like the _Zamindars_, _Talukdars_, etc. The
Congress Committee which was convinced of the fact that
because of the pauperization of the peasantry on account of
the economic crisis, the peasants were unable to pay the
rent. At the same time, the Committee assured the government
that it would withdraw the advice given to the peasants
if the government were willing to enquire into the ability of
the peasants to pay and allow them the necessary remissions.
The government on its part said that if the Congress
withdrew its advice against the payment of rent, it would
consider the question of an enquiry. (It was obvious that this
was no guarantee for a remission of rent). In the circumstances,
the Committee decided nut to withdraw the advice
already given to the peasants, but reiterated it once again.

These activities were conducted directly under the UP
Congress Committee. Its president TAK Sherwani had
the full support and co-operation of Jawaharlal Nehru and
other Congress leaders. Thus, the UP Congress leadership
considered activities among peasants based on their day-today
life problems its main task.

This enraged the authorities. They launched an
organized attack on the UP Congress leaders. Purushotham
Das Tandan, a Congress leader of the Allahabad, and
many others were arrested. Jawaharlal Nehru who had
gone to Bombay to make arrangements for the treatment of
his ailing wife was served with an order of internment on his
return confining him within the limits of Allahabad and
prohibiting him from speaking in public meetings or writing
in newspapers. Similar orders were served on the UP
Congress President Sherwani and many other leaders.
Disregarding these orders, Nehru and Sherwani boarded a
train for Bombay on 26th December to meet Gandhi who
was to reach there on the 28th. The moment the train
passed Allahabad town, it was stopped and both of them
were arrested.

Meanwhile, the UP Government had issued an ordinance
to suppress the no-rent movement. A similar ordinance
was issued in NWFP as well to suppress the _Red Shirt_
movement. There Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, his brother,
Dr Khan Saheb, and many other leaders were arrested.
Besides, Police firing also took place in a number of places.
Thus, UP and the North West Frontier Province came
under an _Ordinance Raj_.

In Bengal, too, the repression was getting intensified.
There was no mass movement there based either on agrarian
issues as in UP and Gujarat or on tribal fraternity as in
NWFP. But the younger Congress workers in Bengal were
far ahead in militancy of their comrades in other parts of
the country. Consequently, thousands of young activists
were thrown into jail without trial. In one of the prisons in
Hooghly a beastly manhunt was carried out in which two
prisoners were killed and over twenty were seriously injured.
Simultaneously, in Chittagong, which had witnessed the
armoury raid earlier, the people had to face the most barbarous
repression. Hundreds of them were beaten up and
tortured in many ways. Ordinances were issued on the pretext
of suppressing terrorists, which in practice were utilized
to hunt out the Congress workers.

In short, Gandhi who had to return to India helpless and
empty-handed on account of the united stand taken by the
minority communal leaders, had to face an extremely difficult
situation. Before dealing with the steps that he took in
relation to this new situation and the government's response
to them, it is necessary to say a few words on the sympathy
and fraternity the Indian freedom movement had earned
from the democrats of other countries as a consequence of
Gandhi's journey abroad.

On his way to London, Gandhi was received by the
representatives of the national democratic movements of
Egypt and other Arab countries, who promised their cooperation
to India's _freedom struggle_. During his stay in
London, ordinary workers, activists of the _Labour Party_ and
trade unions, journalists and others expressed and demonstrated
their regard and sympathy to Gandhi and the movement
he represented. A number of well-known public leaders
and popular journals of many countries, including England
and the USA, expressed their sympathy towards the
Indian freedom movement. The speeches that Gandhi
made in the plenary session of the _Round Table Conference_
and in the committees and the many statements that he made
outside the Conference received world-wide publicity. In
other words, Gandhi was able to make at least a small section
among the democrats of other countries conscious about
the manoeuvres of the British and the falsity of the official
propaganda that Britain was continuing its rule in India
because of the inability of Gandhi to solve the problems of
the minority communities.

The Congress representatives and members of the
_Working Committee_ had reached Bombay at the time of
Gandhi's arrival there to discuss with him and find solutions
to the innumerable issues referred to above. It was evident
that in the context of the failure of the _Round Table Conference_
and the deterioration in the situation in the country
as a whole, a country-wide struggle was inevitable. As a
part of it, Gandhi decided to establish direct contact with
the Viceroy. On 29th December, Gandhi sent a telegram to
the Viceroy:

>I was unprepared on landing yesterday to find
Frontier and United Provinces ordinances, shooting in Frontier
and arrests of valued comrades in both, on the top of
the _Bengal ordinance_ waiting me. I do not know whether
I am to regard these as an indication that the friendly relations
between us are closed, or whether you expect me still
to see you and receive guidance from you as to the course
I am to pursue in advising the Congress. I would esteem a
wire in reply.

Within two days (on 31st December) a reply telegram
was received from the Private Secretary of the Viceroy,
condemning the activities of the _Congressmen_ in Bengal,
UP, and NWFP and justifying the steps taken by the
government to face these activities. The telegram stated:

>...His Excellency feels bound to emphasize that he will
not be prepared to discuss with you the measures which the
Government of India, with the full approval of his Majesty's
Government, have found it necessary to adopt in Bengal,
the United Provinces, and the North-West Frontier Province.
These measures must in any case be kept in force until they
have served the purpose for which they were imposed, namely,
the preservation of "law and order" essential to a "good government".

The message made it obvious that unlike Viceroy
Lord Irwin who, under instructions from the then Labour
government, initiated discussions with the Congress to solve
the issues under dispute, the new Viceroy, Lord Willingdon,
under the Conservative government, was not willing to
follow the path of his predecessor. The rulers were convinced
that as a result of the clever policies pursued by the Secretaries
of State for India and the Viceroys in accordance with
the directives of both the Labour and Conservative governments,
the Congress had been successfully isolated and that
conditions were ripe for a direct confrontation with it.
Therefore, the Congress had no other choice but to leave
the path of negotiation and enter the path of struggle.

Yet, it was necessary to explain why the struggle was
being launched. So, Gandhi sent one more telegram to the
Viceroy on Ist January 1932, in which he gave a reply to the
allegation raised by the government with regard to the conditions
in UP, Bengal and NWFP. Regarding the allegation
that the terrorists in Bengal were resorting to violence.
Gandhi said:

>As to Bengal, the Congress is at one with the Government
in condemning assassinations and should heartily cooperate
with the Government in measures that may be found
necessary to stamp out such crimes. But whilst the Congress
would condemn in unmeasured terms, methods of terrorism,
it can in no way associate itself with Government terrorism
as is betrayed by the _Bengal Ordinance_ and the acts done
thereunder, but must resist within the limits of its prescribed
creed of _non-violence_ such measures of legalised
Government terrorism.

He accused the government of its unwillingness to enter
into talks on the situation prevailing in Bengal and other
provinces. He informed the Viceroy that in the absence
of an alternative, he was compelled to advise the _Congress
Working Committee_ to embark on _civil disobedience_, the
inseparable part of his creed of _non-violence_. A copy of
the resolution adopted by the _Working Committee_ in accordance
with his advice was also sent along with the message.
The resolution stated:

>The absence of any satisfactory response from the
>Government in terms of (the main issues) the Working
>Committee will regard as an indication on the part of the
>Government that it has reduced to nullity the _Delhi Pact_.
>In the event of a satisfactory response not forthcoming, the
>_Working Committee_ calls upon the nation to resume _Civil
>Disobedience_ including non-payment of taxes under the following
>conditions and illustrative heads.
>
>1. No province or district or _Tehsil_ or village is bound
>to take up _Civil Disobedience_ unless the people thereof
>understand the _non-violent_ nature of the struggle with all its
>implications and are ready to undergo sufferings involving
>loss of life and property.
>2. Non-violence must be observed in thought, word and
>deed in the face of the gravest provocation, it being understood
>that the campaign is not one of seeking revenge or inflicting
>injuries on the oppressor, but it is one of converting
>him through self-suffering and self-purification.
>3. Social _boycott_ with the intention of inflicting injury
>on Government Officers, police or _anti-nationalists_ with the
>spirit of _non-violence_.
>4. It should be borne in mind that _non-violent_ campaigns
>are independent of pecuniary assistance. Therefore, there
>should be no hired volunteers, but their bare maintenance
>and maintenance of the dependents of poor men and women
>who might have been imprisoned or killed is permissible wherever
>it is possible. The _Working Committee_, however,
>expects workers in the cause to continue the struggle even
>though they might have to suffer privations.
>5. _Boycott_ of all foreign cloth whether British or of
>other countries is obligatory under all circumstances.
>6. All _Congressmen_ and women are expected to use
>handspun and hand-woven khaddar to the exclusion of even
>cloth manufactured in the indigenous mills.
>7. Picketing of liquor shops and foreign cloth shops
>should be vigorously conducted chiefly by women, but always
>so as to ensure perfect _non-violence_.
>8. Unlicensed manufacture and collection of salt should
>be resumed.
>9. If processions and demonstrations are organised, only
>those should join them who will stand _lathi charges_ or bullets
>without moving from their respective places.
>10. Even in _non-violent_ war _boycott_ of goods manufactured
>by the oppressor is perfectly lawful in as much as
>it is never the duty of the victim to promote or retain commercial
>relations with the oppressor.
>
>Therefore _boycott_ of British goods and British concerns
>should be resumed and vigorously prosecuted.
>11. Civil breach of non-moral laws and of laws and
>orders injurious to the people wherever it is considered possible
>and advisable may be practised.
>12. All unjust orders issued under the ordinances may be
>civilly disobeyed.

On 2nd January Gandhi received a reply telegram from
the Viceroy expressing regret at the decision of the _Congress
Working Committee_ to restart the _civil disobedience movement_
and pointing out that Gandhi and the Congress would
be held responsible for all the consequences arising out of it.
In his reply to this message, Gandhi recalled that while he
was conducting negotiations with the former Viceroy about
a year back, the Congress had been conducting a _civil disobedience
movement_, and it was never a hindrance to the
talks. Gandhi further indicated that if the government
desired to have talks even after the Congress had decided
to restart the _civil disobedience movement_, there would be
no difficulty whatsoever.

However, as pointed out earlier, the government had
already decided to drag the Congress into a struggle again.
Thousands of Congress leaders and workers, including
Gandhi and the Congress president Vallabhbhai Patel, were
arrested. All over the country there were police _lathi-charges_
and firings. All that happened in 1930--31 was repeated
on a broader scale and in a more intense form, With this
started a new stage in the struggle known as the "_Second Civil Disobedience Movement_"

## THE CRUCIAL TEST

It is clear that the _Second Civil Disobedience Movement_
of 1932 was launched under conditions which were more
favourable to the government than to the Congress. In fact,
it would be more correct to say that the _Second Civil Disobedience
Movement_ was forced upon the Congress, rather
than to say that it was launched by the Congress.

In 1930 the '_Salt Satyagraha_' was launched after a long
period of preparation. The _Dandi March_ organized as a
prelude to it, the violation of the salt law by Gandhi himself
at the end of the march and the statements and speeches of
Gandhi before and after the _Dandi March_, etc., had gained
wide publicity in the country and abroad. The decision of
the government to let Gandhi free for about a month and
the discussions initiated by the government with the leaders
in jail through mediators had created the impression that a
compromise would be reached between the Congress and the
government before long. Talks with the leaders on the one
side and cruel repression on the other --- this was the approach
of the government.

In 1932, on the other hand, just a week after Gandhi's
disembarkation at Bombay on 4th January, he and the top
Congress leaders who were left outside jail were arrested.
In the telegrams exchanged immediately before the arrests,
the government had clearly ruled out any possibility of a
compromise with the Congress. The government had categorically
stated that it was not willing to discuss any of the
issues which the Congress had raised through Gandhi. The
exchange of telegrams during the week before the arrests
was only to make this amply clear, and as soon as the Congress
decided to launch the _civil disobedience_ in protest against
the attitude of the government, all the leaders were,
arrested.

In other words, while the initiative for launching the
_civil disobedience movement_ of 1930 was with the Congress,
in 1932 it was with the government. The principal reason
for this difference has been indicated earlier. Before 1930,
the government could not yet accomplish its task of rallying
the native princes, the organizations and parties of communal-caste
politics, the liberal politicians, etc., against the struggle
organized by the Congress. Consequently, they were not
able to rally against the Congress even those who were politically
at logger head with the Congress. With the _Second Round Table Conference_, however, this task had been accomplished
by the government.

A new constitution was promised with broad autonomy
for the provinces and with wider powers to the elected members
of the Central Assembly. Though the liberals were one
with the Congress in expressing dissatisfaction with the
proposed changes at the Centre, since they fell far short of
even _Dominion Status_, they looked at the proposed changes
at the provincial level as "so far so good". Hence, the
programme of struggle like _non-cooperation_ and _civil disobedience_
was not to their liking. As for the leaders of minority
community and caste and religious organizations, they came
out openly against the Congress and its programme.

Making use of this situation, the government succeeded
in unleashing a powerful propaganda campaign against the
Congress and its programme for struggle. This was a new
weapon which the government did not possess during the 1930
struggle.

But this was not the only weapon in the arsenal of the
government. New ordinances were issued giving special
powers to officials to deal with "law and order". The new
Secretary of State for India, Sir Samuel Hoare of the Conservative
party reiterated the government's determination
to take every action to suppress "this challenge to our authority".
He was, in fact, declaring in unambiguous terms what
the Viceroy had told Gandhi in his telegram that "these
measures must in any case be kept in force until they have
served the purpose for which they are imposed".

We have noted earlier that certain special powers
(ordinances) were already in use in Bengal, UP and NWFP
even before Gandhi had returned to India. Of these, one
ordinance issued in Bengal was ostensibly meant for "suppressing
terrorism". But, in fact, it contained many provisions
which could be used against those who really were not
involved in the terrorist movement. For example, it empowered
any government official authorised by the government
to arrest and question anyone on suspicion. He had also
the powers to resort to any step to enforce the arrest. Besides,
it empowered the government to take possession, from the
owner or the resident, of any building along with fittings
and furniture, with or without compensation. _District magistrates_
were given the powers to ban the entry of any person
or persons into public places like the railways, impose restrictions
on travel, and confiscate vehicles, etc. They were
also given the powers to demand and get assistance from
landowners, teachers, etc., in the maintenance of "law and
order" and to issue arrest warrant against any suspect. The
government was vested with the powers to impose collective
fines, and also exempt from it anyone whom the government
considered fit, realize arrears of fine and revenue. After
enforcing several such diabolical laws, it was declared that
they could not be challenged in a court of law.

The UP ordinance was designed to face the no-rent
movement there. Many of the provisions of the _Bengal
ordinance_ were incorporated in the UP ordinance. In
NWFP, three ordinances were promulgated. There too
any officer authorized by the government could impose restrictions
on anyone on suspicion and impose collective fine.
It was in this background of denial of civil liberties that
Gandhi's telegram to the Viceroy and the _Congress Working
Committee_ resolution pointed out the inevitability of _civil
disobedience_. This was the situation prevailing before the
exchange of telegrams between the Viceroy and Gandhi and
the launching of the _civil disobedience_. The violation of civil
rights was then confined to three provinces. But with the
exchange of telegrams between Gandhi and the Viceroy and
the decision of the _Working Committee_ to restart the _civil
disobedience_, the Viceroy promulgated four new ordinances
extending the provisions of special powers to the whole
country.

One of these ordinances was to extend the laws which
were enforced earlier in the three states as mentioned above,
giving wider powers to the police and the _District Magistrates_.

_Second_, all-India ordinance was the _Unlawful
Instigation Ordinance_. The principal provision in that ordinance
was that it makes anyone speaking against payment
of dues to the government liable for fine and imprisonment
upto six months.

_Third_, the _Unlawful Organizations Ordinance_ empowered
the provincial governments to confiscate the movable
and immovable properties and funds of any organization
declared illegal and to declare illegal any organization found
to be working prejudicial to the maintenance of "law and order".

_Fourth_, entitled the _Harassment and Boycott
Prevention Ordinance_, was designed to prevent the programme
of _boycott_ which was considered to have been effectively
carried out during the _first civil disobedience movement_ and
the social _boycott_ which was suspected to have been planned
now. Clearly, this ordinance was promulgated to wreck any
demonstration of popular anger at those who were siding
with the government and betray the _freedom struggle_.

The Secretary of State for India, Samuel Hoare himself
had declared in the Parliament that these ordinances which
were in the mould even before the return of Gandhi and
promulgated the day on which Gandhi and other leaders were
arrested were very harsh and cruel. He further stated that
what motivated the government for preparing these ordinances
was the "sincere belief" that there was a threat of attack
on the entire foundation of the government and that if these
ordinances were not promulgated it would lead to "anarchy".
In other words, it was the aim of the government to destroy
the popular base of the Congress by using all weapons in its
arsenal, and after accomplishing it, put forward a new _constitutional
reforms_ proposal acceptable to the liberal politicians
and leaders of the caste-communal politics.

Following the promulgation of these ordinances, the
_Congress Working Committee_, most of the provincial and
district committees and the local committees in a number of
places were banned. So also were a large number of social-cultural
organizations under the leadership of patriotic
individuals. Their properties were confiscated and bank
deposits frozen. Nehru had stated in his _Autobiography_ that
there were rumours that Anand Bhavan (later,_Swaraj Bhavan_)
in Allahabad, which was donated by Motilal Nehru during
the 1930 _civil disobedience movement_ and used as the all-India
headquarters of the Congress, would be confiscated.

The income-tax for the year prior to the passing away
of Motilal Nehru was in arrears because of the _civil disobedience
movement_. One instalment towards the arrears
had been paid in the months following the _Gandhi-Irwin
Pact_. But with the launching of the _second civil disobedience_
and the no-tax campaign being part of the movement,
Jawaharlal Nehru did not pay further instalments of arrears.
Nehru reasoned later that it would have been completely
wrong and immoral on his part if he, a person who advised
the peasants against payment of tax and rent, himself were
to pay the income-tax. However, no action was taken on
Anand Bhavan.

But, the movable and immovable properties of many
Congress workers and Congress committees were confiscated
or attached by the government. The government thought
that, along with measures like _lathi-charges_, torture, firings,
etc., if it could generate the fear that their properties
also would be confiscated, the people could be kept away
from the struggle. But, braving all these, the ordinary
people all over the country came forward to raise the banner
of the _freedom struggle_. Tens of thousands were thrown
into prison. In every province, in different places, thousands
took out processions in violation of the law and faced
ruthless police repression. (Nehru has recorded in a sorrowful
but proud tone how his sisters and relatives and even his
old and frail mother who led demonstrations were beaten
by the police so badly that they had to be carried away.)

As compared to 1930, women, students and youth came
forward in larger numbers and participated more actively
in the struggle. And each section had its own volunteer
organization. Though the Congress and other organizations
were declared illegal making it impossible for them to work
openly, it became clear that these organizations and the
national feeling they represented had not lost their position
in the hearts of the people.

Another demonstration of the same was the change that
came about in the Congress organization itself. In 1930,
the procedure was that immediately a president and _Working
Committee_ members were arrested, a new president and
Committee members filled their places. In 1932, however,
instead of the president, there came into being a "dictator"
and a "war council" to help him at all levels. The use of
these new terms was intended to create the belief among the
people that, though based on _non-violence_, a country-wide
war was being waged against the enemy of the nation.

Besides, there was a system in vogue under which when
a "dictator" was arrested, a new "dictator" was nominated
as his successor, and he would evade arrest for two or three
days before openly violating the law. Thus, the absconding
"dictators" evading the police would suddenly appear in
public places and declare the violation of law. This was
arranged through secret organizations.

There were also various other activities such a printing
and distributing newspapers and leaflets in secret, pasting
_anti-British_ posters on walls, and hoisting the national flag
over government offices without being noticed by the police.
A characteristic feature of the _second civil disobedience
movement_ was the presence of an underground organization,
opposed to the form of struggle conceived by Gandhi and
anchored on "truth" though it was, to effectively carry out
such programmes.

Another feature of the 1932 struggle was that it aroused
a world public opinion in favour of the struggle and against
the repression unleashed by the government. It was true
that on account of the gagging of the press and other controls
imposed on it, the movement did not get as much
publicity as in 1930 in the Indian Press. But it got enormous
publicity in the foreign newspapers.

Among the events that took place during the second
disobedience movement, mention must be made particularly
of the holding of all-India and local level conferences
without being noticed by the police. Thus, an all-India conference
of the Congress was announced to be held in Delhi
in April 1932 under the presidentship of Pandit Malaviya.
As soon as he left for Delhi, he was arrested. But over 500 delegates who had come from different provinces met
secretly in Delhi and conducted the normal proceedings of
the conference in a few minutes. Only towards the close
of the conference did the police get information about it and
rush to the spot and arrest the delegates. A similar all-India
conference was held in Calcutta a year later, followed by the
conferences at the provincial and district levels. All became
convinced that, however sharp the weapons used to suppress
the Congress, the movement that had developed under the
leadership of the Congress was such that it could no longer
be suppressed.

But the struggle which the authorities had decided to
suppress at any cost --- particularly the one under Gandhi's leadership,
which had adopted _non-violence_ as a creed --- had its
characteristic weaknesses. Whether it was a struggle as of 1930 launched under the initiative of the Congress, or like
that of 1932 which was imposed on the Congress by the government,
the mass enthusiasm witnessed at the beginning
of the struggle would not last for long. Had there been a
ground to expect that a long-drawn-out struggle would compel
the government to come to a compromise as was the case
in 1930--31, it would have been possible on that expectation
to continue the struggle for some time. But under the
conditions of 1932 in which there was no room for such an
expectation, the mass enthusiasm which was witnessed in the
beginning of the struggle did not last long, although the
masses of the people were clearly with the Congress and
against the government.

Thus, the fatigue and the state of helplessness which
manifested in the struggle gave rise to the question of "what
next". We shall examine in the following sections Gandhi's
answer to this question, the gain it could make through the
strategy of the struggle under the _bourgeois_ leadership as
well as the danger it contained.

## FASTING AND THE _POONA PACT_

As we know, the _Second Civil Disobedience Movement_
was the result of the failure to arrive at an understanding on
the minority issue at the _Second Round Table Conference_.
This time, the authorities were determined not to give any
concession to the Congress. As part of this policy, the
work of framing a new constitution in accordance with the
proposals placed by the Government in the Conference,
continued. The Committee with Lord Lothian as Chairman
which was appointed to decide on the question of voting
right arrived in India on 17th January. Needless to say, while
the Committee arrived in India, Gandhi and other leaders
were in jail.

It was a clear indication to the fact that the government
was determined to go ahead, as in the words of the Secretary
of State for India, Sir Samuel Hoare, "let the dogs bark,
the caravan will go on". It became further clear that however
powerful the _civil disobedience movement_, the proposals
presented by the government at the _Second Round Table
Conference_ were going to be included in the new constitution.
Unlike what happened in the case of _First Civil Disobedience
Movement_, now there was no possibility of a settlement
after continuing the struggle for a few months.

It was at this juncture that Gandhi, with his characteristic
skill of diplomacy, began to make moves on the chess
board of _bourgeois_ politics. While the authorities, as part
of an attempt to suppress the entire freedom movement, were
forcing the Congress under _bourgeois_ leadership to surrender,
Gandhi's move was designed to counter this move of the
authorities. His line of thinking was that, although it might
be possible for the authorities to suppress the freedom movement,
they would not be able to destroy the influence he had
on the people. Moreover, he wanted to force the authorities
to retrace their steps at least on a minor issue.

We have already referred to a speech Gandhi made at
the meeting of the Minority Committee of the _Second Round
Table Conference_. In that speech he had stated that what
ever the safeguards made for non-Hindus, like Muslims,
Sikhs, Christians etc., he would oppose even at the cost
his life the allocation of separate electorate for the depressed
communities among the Hindus.

Observing the events following the _Second Round Table
Conference_, Gandhi suspected that the proposals which were
going to come from the government were those which he
would have to "oppose even at the cost of his life". He
paid deep thought as to what he and his colleague could do
inside the jail while the work of the _Lothian Committee_ was
going unobstructed outside. As a result of this hard thinking,
Gandhi sent a letter on 11th March to Samuel Hoare
from the Yerwada jail, in which he reiterated his determination
to "resist with life", separate electorate for the Depressed
Castes.

Explaining in some detail why he had taken that stand,
Gandhi stated emphatically that he was not against giving
the Depressed Castes representation in the legislature. He
added that he was in favour of giving voting right to the
adults among them. Gandhi was of the opinion that even if
educational qualification, property ownership, etc., were
imposed on members of other communities as conditions for
voting right, members of the Depressed Castes should be
exempted from such conditions. But he believed that a system
of separate electorate for them as distinct from other Hindus
would, instead of helping them, do harm to them. Gandhi
warned that if the government's final proposals were to
introduce such a system, he would go on a "fast unto death."

In his letter to the Secretary of State for India, Gandhi
not only referred to the voting rights of the Depressed
Castes and their representation in the legislature, but also
wrote that he was shocked by the repression let loose by the
government all over the country. All government servants,
Gandhi pointed out, both Englishmen and Indians, were
gradually being dehumanized and turned into heartless creatures;
he could not say how long he could bear with it.
May be, this too, Gandhi pointed out, would drive him to
undertake another fast in the future. However, for the present
his fast would be on the question of voting rights and representation
in the legislatures to the Depressed Castes.

Samuel Hoare sent a reply to this letter after one month,
_i.e._, on 13th April, in which he stated that he was unable to
say anything regarding the right to vote and the representation
in the legislature to the Depressed Castes and that
once the work of the concerned committee was over, the
government would take a decision, taking into consideration
Gandhi's opinion also. He, however, emphatically stated
that the government could not show any mercy to those who
were violating law and indulging in violence against an
"established government." As long as the _civil disobedience
movement_ continued, the emergency laws would operate,
he said.

This exchange of letters between Samuel Hoare and
Gandhi remained confidential. Gandhi had made it clear in
that letter that none except Vallabhbhai Patel and Mahadey
Desai who were in jail with him, would know about it. The
government did not give any publicity to this exchange of
letters, either. But, disregarding the warning given by Gandhi,
the government took its own decision on the right to vote
and the representation in the legislature of all sections,
including the Depressed Castes.

On 17th August 1932, the government announced the
scheme of minority representation, known as the _Communal
Award_. The very next day (18th August) Gandhi wrote a
letter to the British Prime Minister in which he gave notice
that unless the proposals regarding the Depressed Castes were
withdrawn, he would go on a "perpetual fast unto death" from 20th September. The Prime Minister replied on 8th September.
When this letter was published on 12th September along with
Gandhi's letter of 9th September, the earlier correspondence
between Gandhi and Hoare was also published. It was only
then that the people understood the meaning of Gandhi's
phrase, "resist with my life."

Gandhi began his fast in Yerwada jail on 20th September.
Earlier, his decision to go on fast had led to serious discussions
and expressions of emotion in India and abroad. Appeals
poured in from all parts of the world to save Gandhi's life
by arriving at a settlement. But the government remained
unmoved. The spokesmen of the government insisted that
only those amendments which were unanimously agreed upon
by all the concerned parties, including the leaders of the
Depressed Castes, would be acceptable to them. While the
attempts to save Gandhi's life continued vigorously, days
dragged on and on.

Before going into how the fasting ended, it is necessary
to take a closer look at the proposals on _constitutional reforms_
put forward by the government. The government had not put
forward any proposal on the administration at the Centre.
Attempt were made only to solve the problems relating to
provincial legislatures. This is the first and foremost fact
which needs special mention.

It may be recalled that at the _Round Table Conference_
it was made clear that the government was willing to make
some concessions only on the question of extending the role
of people's representatives in relation to the provincial administration.
Hence, the government's proposal to continue
with the bureaucratic rule at the Centre did not come near
even the _Dominion Status_ envisaged by the 'moderate' leadership,
leave alone the demand of _full independence_ made by
the Congress. Consequently, even the liberals and the
leaders of religious-caste politics were opposed to this part
of the government proposals.

Gandhi's fast, however, was not on this central issue.
Separate electoral constituencies have been proposed not only
to the Depressed Castes and non-Hindu communities, but
also to Europeans, Chamber of Commerce, landlords, etc.
There were provisions in the proposal for separate electoral
lists and representations for landlords, commercial interests
and Europeans who feared that their interests would not be
safeguarded by those who were to get elected from general
constituencies or even by those elected from constituencies
reserved for minority communities and Depressed Castes.

The reason for this is obvious. This provision was
designed to increase the representation of the vested interests
and reduce the representation of those with relatively more
popular base. These special privileges allowed to the vested
interests also did not attract protest from Gandhi. In fact,
Gandhi himself had agreed to a separate electorate for the
Muslim, Sikh and Christian religious groups, because he
thought it improper for him to raise objections on matters
relating to these groups. What he was opposed to was the
extension of this same provision to the Depressed Castes.

Utilizing this, Gandhi's opponents tried to characterize
him an enemy of the Depressed Castes. This allegation
was, in fact, contained in the letter of the Prime Minister.
And to justify it, he had raised certain arguments which
were in turn repeated by many of the leaders of the Depressed
Castes in India.

But on 25th September, the sixth day of Gandhi's fast,
an agreement was signed by certain prominent leaders of
Depressed Castes and _Caste Hindus_. This agreement known
as the "_Poona Pact_" proposed important changes in the
government proposal. In accordance with its own earlier
declarations, the government had to accept these alternative
proposals put forward jointly by the concerned parties.

How did this amazing change come about among the
members of the Depressed Castes? Were their leaders compelled
to change their position by Gandhi's pressure tactics
of fasting? If so, was it not, in effect, a use of force against
them?

The Gandhians might be able to answer this question
in accordance with the Gandhian Philosophy. But ordinary
people who have no particular sympathy or opposition to
the Gandhian path have a different answer to give. If one
compares the representation granted by the leaders of the
minority communities to the Depressed Castes at the _Second Round Table Conference_, the representation granted in the
proposals put forward by the government in August 1932,
and the representation offered in the _Poona Pact_, it can be
seen that the _Poona Pact_ contained provisions more favourable
to the Depressed Castes, as shown in the following table.

From the table it is clear that according to the _Poona
Pact_, the Depressed Castes were to get more than twice the
number of seats they could have got according to the government
proposals. True, the _Poona Pact_ granted a little less
than the "maximum demand" conceded by other minority
community leaders. But there was no question about the
benefit derived from the "_Poona Pact_" as compared to that
granted according to the government proposal.

In fact, in UP and CP[^cp], the _Poona Pact_ accepted as
many seats as proposed by the minority community leaders
in 1931. in Bihar and Orissa they were given more seats
than what was proposed by the minority community leaders.
In Punjab, they were not allotted a single seat by the government,
whereas the _Poona Pact_ gave them eight. Briefly, had
the Depressed Caste leaders stuck to the government proposals
without accepting the terms of the _Poona Pact_, they would
have been the losers.

[^cp]: Central Provinces

At the London conference, the Depressed Caste leaders
had claimed special constituencies as those for the non-Hindu
communities like the Muslims, Sikhs, Christians,
etc., which was recognised by leaders of the minority communities.
But the government formulated its proposals with
an important change introducing in it. According to this,
there would be a separate voters' list for Depressed Castes,
and only those in this list had the right to vote and contest
as candidates in the elections. In addition, the general voters'
list for all Hindus would also include their names so that
they could vote and contest elections in these general constituencies
as well.

The argument put forward by the government was that
since the Depressed Caste had the right to vote and to be
elected from the general constituencies as well, they were not
separated from the rest of the Hindus as feared by Gandhi.
They also tried to show that those Depressed Castes capable
of getting elected from general constituencies would boost
their number in the legislature. But the Depressed Castes found
it more advantageous to have a larger number of seats reserved
for them as envisaged in the _Poona Pact_ than to have
fewer seats in reserved constituencies with the right in theory
to contest and win from general constituencies.

It was the "profit and loss account" calculated in this
manner that motivated Ambedkar, MC Rajah, Rajbhoj
and other Depressed Caste leaders to sign the _Poona Pact_.

On the other hand, Gandhi was successful at least in
driving a wedge into the comprehensive scheme presented by
the government. Thus, the Congress was able to attract into
its camp the Depressed Caste leaders who had taken their
position in the camp of the _Muslim League_ and other communal-caste
politicians during the _Second Round Table
Conference_. This enabled Gandhi to re-establish relation with
the external world which had been cutoff since 4th January
at least on one point. Soon after launching the fast on 20th
September, he got an opportunity to meet and talk with other
mass leaders. Although confined to jail, he got the freedom
to conduct the activities for the upliftment of the Depressed
Castes (the term "_Harijan_" began to be widely used during
this period for the members of these castes).

However, this was a great blow to the freedom movement.
For this led to the diversion of the people's attention
from the objective of _full independence_ to the mundane
issue of upliftment of the _Harijans_.

## THE POLITICS OF _HARIJAN_ WELFARE

As we have noted earlier, Gandhi had indicated in his
letter to samuel Hoare that he might have to go on fast on
questions relating to the release of political prisoners and
the ending of repression. But as the exchange of correspondence
continued in the months of August and September and
the fasting began, the question of repression receded to the
background. In other words, Gandhi had come to the conclusion
that a fast on that issue was not in keeping with practical
politics.

But, immediately before and after the commencement of
the fast, a number of prominent leaders, both Congress and _non-Congress_, met
first in Bombay, then in Poona and again in Bombay,
to find a solution to the Depressed Castes issue involved
in the fast. It was but natural that their discussions were not
confined to the issue of the Depressed Castes alone. Discussions
were also held informally on the political situation following
the arrest of Gandhi and other leaders, ways of solving
the political crisis as early as possible ending the repression
and so on. Since the formal discussions were centred around
the Depressed Caste issues alone and since the government
had adopted a totally unhelpful attitude in the matter of
implementing decisions emerging from political discussions,
these informal discussions on political issues reached nowhere.
But the formal discussions and the steps that Gandhi took
on the basis of these discussions removed the struggle away
from the masses and built a base for starting negotiations
with the government once again.

As Gandhi began his fast, the government came up with
a proposal to release him from the jail subject to certain
conditions. But he took a firm position that he was not willing
to be released subject to conditions. Gandhi realized
that his coming out of the jail on conditions and at the mercy
of the government without a solution to the issue of repression
which he had raised would weaken the movement. At
the same time, he had also realized that the situation of
continuing repression by the government, on the one side, and
the people's resistance, on the other, could not be prolonged
and that a way had to be found to get out of the situation.
What he told the press correspondents who met him in the
jail on 2016 September and what he wrote to the Government
of Bombay on 21st September were reflections of this realization.
The important points he mentioned are as follows.
Gandhi stated:

>In attacking, untouchability I have gone to the very root
of the matter, and therefore, it is an issue of transcendental
value, far surpassing _Swaraj_ in terms of political constitutions, and I would say that such a constitution would be
a dead-weight if it was not backed by a moral basis, in
the shape of the present hope engendered in the breasts of
the down-trodden millions that that weight is going to be
lifted from their shoulders.

The issue of repression which Gandhi considered
significant in his letter of 11th March was no longer significant
for him now. Not only that. Now he had subordinated
the struggle for _Swaraj_ to the day-to-day activities for the
upliftment of the Depressed Castes. What is more, Gandhi
gave a moral (religious) character to this political approach,
which he alone could do. Talking to the newsmen, he said:

>If people won't laugh at me, I would gently put forward
a claim which I have always asserted that I am a 'touchable'
by birth, but an 'untouchable' by choice, and I have
endeavoured to qualify myself to represent, not the upper
ten even among the 'touchables' because be it said to their
shame that there were castes and classes among them, but my
ambition is to represent and identify myself with, as far as
possible, the lowest strata of the 'untouchables' namely
the 'invisibles' and the 'unapproachables', whom I have
always before my mind's eye wherever I go; for they have
indeed drunk deep of the poison cup. I have met them in
Malabar and in Orissa, and am convinced that if they are
ever to rise, it will not be by reservation of seats but will
be by the strenuous work of Hindu reformers in their midst.

He added:

>There should be no coercion on those who are opposed to
joint electorates. I have no difficulty in understanding their
bitter opposition. They have every right to distrust me.
Do I not belong to that Hindu section, mis-called superior
class or _Caste Hindus_, who have ground down to powder
the so-called untouchables? The marvel is the latter have
remained nevertheless in the Hindu fold. But whilst I can
justify this opposition I believe that they are in error. They
will, if they can, separate the depressed' classes entirely
form the Hindu society and from them into separate class
 --- a standing and living reproach in Hinduism. I should
not mind if thereby their interest could be really served.
But an intimate acquaintance with every shade of untouchability
convinces me that their lives as much as they are so
intimately mixed with those of the _Caste Hindus_ in whose
midst and for whom they live that it is impossible to
separate them. They are part of an individual family.
Their revolt against Hindus with whom they live and their
apostasy from Hinduism, I should understand, but this,
so far I can see, they will not do. There is a subtle something --- quite
indefinable --- in Hinduism which keeps them
in it even in spite of themselves.

Thus, the Congress as well as its undisputed leader,
Gandhi, which was engaged in a country-wide struggle with
the objective of liberating India from the British rule, engrossed
itself in the programme of liberating the Depressed
Castes and other Hindus from the curse of untouchability
from which the entire Hindu religious community had been
suffering. The government had given Gandhi the necessary
freedom even while in jail to give leadership to this activity.
The result of these activities was the formation of the _Harijan
Seva Sangh_. The foundation for this was laid by the decision
of the conference held in Bombay under the chairmanship
of Pandit Malaviya immediately before the termination
of Gandhi's fast. The decision which was taken in the form
a resolution is as follows.

>This conference resolves that henceforth, amongst
Hindus, no one shall be regarded as an untouchable by
reason of his birth, and those who have been so regarded
hitherto, will have the same right as other Hindus in regard
to the use of public wells, public schools, public
roads and other public institutions. This right will have
statutory recognition at the first opportunity and shall be
one of the earliest acts of the _Swaraj_ parliament, if it
shall not have received such recognition before to secure,
by every legitimate and peaceful means, an early removal
of all social disabilities now imposed by custom upon the
so-called untouchable classes, including the bar in respect
of admission to temples.

Following this meeting and in response to Gandhi's
repeated appeals, a broad mass movement to remove untouchability
started throughout the country. The movement
turned to different directions such as agitation for temple
entry to _Harijans_ and other untouchables, inter caste dining,
enrolment of _Harijan_ children in schools, liberating them
from traditional customs and so on.

It was in this atmosphere that in Kerala, K. Kelappan
began his fast in front of the famous caste-Hindu temple of
Guruvayoor. Kelappan who had to end his fast on the compulsive
advice of Gandhi later dedicated himself to the service
of _Harijans_, including temple entry. To coordinate such
activities, an _All-India Harijan Sevak Sangh_ with branches at
provincial, district and local levels was formed. Gandhi coordinated
its activities from jail in the early period and later
from Delhi.

A direct result of this was the weakening of the _civil
disobedience movement_. Thousands of Congress activists
and many prominent leaders like Rajagopalachari, who were
active in the midst of the _civil disobedience movement_ for
the past several months gave up their activities completely
and got themselves involved fully in the movement for the
upliftment of the _Harijans_, temple entry, etc.
Although, _civil disobedience_ had in effect got weakened,
it was continuing formally. But in continuing the activities
as before, the movement had to pass a new obstruction. Following
the informal political discussions held at Poona, the
Congress leadership formally gave a directive to its lower
level committees to wind up the underground machinery which
they had set up to carry forward effectively the _civil disobedience
movement_. It was obvious that under the prevailing
conditions of the worst kind of repression, it was impossible
even to sustain the semblance of the movement without an
underground facility to print and distribute leaflets. Through
the directive to give up the underground activity, the Congress
leadership was, in effect, making the disobedience movement
lifeless.

However, the struggle continued in a formal way. As
distinct from 1930--31, in the face of the government's uncompromising
policy, the Congress had no choice but to continue
the struggle, however weak it was. Therefore, new presidents
and secretaries assumed charge following the arrest of one
after another of these functionaries and instructions were
given to the lower committees on activities that could be
carried on openly.

Two important events deserve special mention here. One
was the directive given to observe 4th January 1933 as the
anniversary of the commencement of mass arrests. The
second was the Congress session held at Calcutta in April 1933.

Of these, the first was observed in different parts of the
country. A large number of delegates arrived for the _Calcutta
Congress_ from different parts of the country as was the case
with the Delhi Congress in the previous year. Proceedings
went on despite the ban imposed on the organization. A thousand
of the 2200 delegates who attended session and Pandit
Malaviya who was to preside over the session along with
many leaders were arrested. Many leaders and delegates were
injured in the police _lathi-charge_.

But none of these could affect any change in the political
situation. The government repeatedly stated that unless and
until the Congress officially withdrew the call for _civil disobedience_,
the question of the release of political prisoners or
reducing the intensity of repression did not arise at all.

The Congress did not make any change in its declared
position, either. When the Congress met in Calcutta disregarding
the ban, the independence resolution of the Lahore
Congress and the official decisions of the _Working Committee_
on _civil disobedience_ were reiterated. The resolution reviewing
the then existing conditions gave a call to strengthen and
widen the _civil disobedience movement_. The conference
condemned the reform scheme published by the Government
after the launching of the _civil disobedience movement_ and
the repressive actions against the movement.

Briefly, though a section of the Congress leaders and a
majority of sympathizers had left the _civil disobedience
movement_ and involved themselves completely in the upliftment
of the _Harijans_, the Congress did not deviate an inch
from its declared path. _Civil disobedience_ continued, though
nominally.

It was in this background that a new move came from
Gandhi. On 8th May, he commenced a "self-purification"
fast which was to last 21 days. The fast, which was not in
protest against anyone's action or on a concrete issue, according
to Gandhi himself, was a whole-hearted appeal for self-purification
in the sense of generating a sense of caution and
vigil on the problems of the _Harijans_ on his own part and
on the part of his colleagues.

The fast had its immediate political impact. Considering
the "nature of the objective of the fast and the sentiment
expressed through it", the government declared its decision
to unconditionally release Gandhi from jail. After coming
out of the jail Gandhi issued a statement which kept the doors
open for negotiations. In the statement he made the following
points clear.

1. Although he was free now, Gandhi would continue
   his fast for self-purification.
2. Although his release from the jail was unconditional,
   Gandhi would not use the freedom to strengthen the _civil
   disobedience movement_ or to give leadership to that movement.
   He would devote his time entirely for the _Harijan_ movement.
3. His faith in the _civil disobedience movement_ remained
   unshaken; the strength of the movement lay not in the
   number of people participating in it, but in their quality.
4. As long as he continued his fast, the sentiments and
   thought of those participating in the _civil disobedience
   movement_ would naturally turn towards the fast and the
   _Harijan_ movement basic to it. In these circumstances it
   would be proper for the Congress President to take a decision
   to suspend the _civil disobedience movement_ for a month
   or six weeks.
5. At the same time, he made a request to the government:
   It must utilise the opportunity provided by the suspension of
   the _civil disobedience movement_ to resume negotiations in
   order to establish the real peace in the country and weld the
   chain of negotiations which was broken following the London
   Conference.

On Gandhi's advice, the Congress president announced
the decision to suspend the _civil disobedience movement_
for a period of six weeks. But the government emphatically
stated that it would not make any change in the policy just
because the movement had been suspended. The government
spokesmen further made it clear that as long as the Congress
possessed the weapon of _civil disobedience_ ready for use
against the government at any moment, the repression would
surely continue. In other words, the government wanted an
unconditional surrender by the Congress.

## _INDIVIDUAL SATYAGRAHA_ AND ITS WITHDRAWAL

Gandhi and other Congress leaders now had to conduct
their activities in the face of not only the opposition from
the government but also the discontent that had begun to
rise among ordinary _Congressmen_.

Gandhi's fast on the issue of the Depressed Castes and
the subsequent developments evoked strong opposition among
the Congress workers and the masses in general who had to
undergo untold hardships for having gone through the
struggle called by the leadership during the _second civil
disobedience movement_. When the acting Congress president,
MS Aney suspended the _civil disobedience_ for a period of
six weeks on the advice of Gandhi, their discontent assumed
a manifest form.

The clearest evidence of this was the statement jointly
issued by Vithalbhai Patel and Subhas Bose from Vienna.
(Following their arrest during the _civil disobedience movement_
of 1932, their health deteriorated in jail; the government
released them and permitted them to go to Vienna for treatment.)
Characterizing the decision taken by Gandhi to
suspend the _civil disobedience_ an "admission of defeat",
the statement continued:

>The latest action of Mr. Gandhi in suspending _Civil
Disobedience_ is a confession of failure. We are clearly of
the opinion that Mr. Gandhi as a political leader has
failed. The time has therefore, come for a radical re-organisation
of the Congress on a new principle with a new
method, for which a new leader is essential, as it is unfair
to expect Mr. Gandhi to work the programme not consistent
with his life-long principles.[^16/1]

[^16/1]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _The History of Indian National Congress_, Bombay,
Padma Publications, (1946 reprint), p. 561.

The statement further pointed out that it would be
welcome if the Congress as a whole was ready for such a
change; otherwise, a new party of radicals would have to be
formed within the Congress.

Subhas Bose was well known as the spokesman of the
left _Congressmen_. As for Vithalbhai Patel, he was one of the
top leaders who, in opposition to the Gandhian programme
had argued a decade earlier for the programme of participation
in the legislature. He was elected to the Central
Assembly first as a candidate of the _Swaraj Party_ and then
as a Congress candidate. As the President of the Central
Assembly, he had demonstrated his extraordinary individuality.
The decision taken by Patel, who was never known
as a leftist but appeared before the people as a real "parliamentarian"
leader, and by Bose, a renowned leftist leader, to
challenge the leadership of Gandhi, created a number of
organizational and political problems for the Congress leadership.

Even Nehru who, despite being a leftist, all along remained
with the leadership, felt disturbed by these developments.

>...gradually, the _civil disobedience movement_ declined;
>but it still carried on, not without distinction. Progressively
>it ceased to be a mass movement. Apart from the
>severity of the Government repression, the first severe
>blow to it came in September 1932 when Gandhiji fasted
>for the first time on the _Harijan_ issue. That fast roused
>mass consciousness, but it directed it in another direction.
>_Civil disobedience_ was finally killed for all practical purposes
>by the suspension of it in May 1933. It continued
>after that more in theory than in practice. It is no doubt
>true that, even without that suspension, it would have
>gradually petered out. India was numbed by the violence
>and harshness of repression. The nervous energy of the
>nation as a whole was for the movement exhausted, and
>it was not being re-charged. Individually there were still
>many who could carry on civil resistance, but they functioned
>in a somewhat artificial atmosphere.
>
>It was not pleasant for us in prison to learn of this slow
>decay of a great movement.


In the subsequent chapters of his _Autobiography_, Nehru
has described at length how these developments made him
to hard thinking. He has stated what reactions the contemporaneous
developments had evoked in a person as he was,
closely observing and analyzing the developments taking
place in India and the world over.

The crisis and the bankruptcy of the capitalist social
system, the rise and progress of the Socialist Soviet Union,
the repression unleashed by the British imperialist all over
the world and in India in particular, and the support they
received from the vested interests in India, the _Socialist-Communist_
trends of thought which were slowly but unmistakably
growing among the millions of poverty-stricken people
of India enthusiastically participating in the _anti-imperialists_
struggle --- all these were leading him to the left.

At the same time, the _anti-Communist_ notions inherent
in the _bourgeois_ democrats free from the revolutionary
outlook of the working class, and the influence of Gandhian
thought had been leading him to the right. These chapters
in his _Autobiography_ clearly show that he was being disturbed
by all the internal contradictions characteristic of a sceptic
helplessly caught in such a cross-current.

Vithalbhai Patel, Subhas Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru
were not isolated individuals. Each of them was the representative
of one or the other section of the Congress ranks.
It was the opposition and challenge to the Gandhian method
of struggle that brought Patel and Bose together. In this,
Nehru's position was quite opposite of these two. But, in
the matter of left political outlook, Nehru and Bose were
somewhat close to each other. The position of Patel was a
continuation of the position which he, Motilal Nehru,
CR Das and others had taken a decade earlier. All the
three trends of thought and political positions were slowly
but unmistakably getting crystallized in the Congress. This,
in fact, led to the formation, on one side, of a new party, a
new edition of the old _Swaraj Party_, concentrating on
parliamentary activity and, on the other, of certain leftist
parties like the _Congress Socialist Party_. The history of the
emergence and development of these parties will be dealt
with in the chapters that follow.

But the problem that the Congress was facing in May-June 1933 was not the emergence of these new parties. Neither
these new parties nor the Congress could work openly and
express their respective opinions in those days. The question
that Gandhi and the Congress were facing was how to create
a situation in which they could work freely and openly. It
was with the hope of finding a means to end this situation
that Gandhi turned the country's entire attention on _Harijan_
service. It was again precisely for this purpose that Gandhi
advised the Congress President to suspend the _civil disobedience
movement_, and the President accepted his advice.
The suspension of _civil disobedience_ was further extended
for another six weeks to enable Gandhi to regain health and
resume discussions with his colleagues. This interval was
also used to find ways to restart negotiations with the
government.

But, as pointed out earlier, there was no favourable
response from the government to any of these moves made
by Gandhi and other Congress leaders.

The Congress leadership was caught in a dilemma
created by its desire to find an opportunity to withdrew the
_civil disobedience_, on the one hand, and the obstinate attitude
of the government to which nothing short of a complete
surrender was acceptable, on the other. So to find a way out
of this dilemma, the Congress leaders decided to have informal
discussions among themselves. Thus, on 12th July 1933,
a meeting of Congress leaders who were then out of jail was
held at Poona, in which different points of view were expressed.
One section argued for an unconditional withdrawal
of the _civil disobedience movement_, while another wanted
the mass struggle to be stopped and _individual civil
disobedience_ launched in its stead. Both these views were,
however, rejected. Finally, it was agreed to make attempts
to find an opportunity for a discussion with the Viceroy.
But the government once again made it clear that nothing
short of a complete surrender was acceptable to it. Consequently,
the meeting decided to continue the struggle "to
uphold the honour of the country". But the new phase of
the struggle should be '_Individual Satyagraha_'.

Gandhi who himself took the lead in offering '_Individual
Satyagraha_' was arrested along with other leaders who took
part in the _satyagraha_, Gandhi was released after a few days,
but was rearrested for offering _satyagraha_ once again. This
time, however, he was denied the facility of carrying on the
activities of _Harijan_ welfare in the jail. Protesting against
this, Gandhi once again went on a fast. The authorities did
not relent at first. But as they apprehended a danger to
Gandhi's life, he was released from jail.

The position Gandhi took this time was entirely different
from that he had taken earlier. He declared that he was
keeping himself aloof from _civil disobedience_ this time and
devoting his entire time to _Harijan_ welfare work, since he
was not a "free man" till 3rd August 1934, the day on which
his term of imprisonment was to expire. At the same time,
he made it clear that if those who were actively taking part
in the _civil disobedience_ sought his advice and guidance,
he would give them to save the movement from taking a
"wrong path".

The subsequent months presented strange situations in
Indian politics. The most revered leader of the _civil disobedience
movement_ kept himself aloof from it and, instead
engaged himself in the activities of _Harijan_ upliftment.
(Gandhi who made a country-wide tour in connection with
_Harijan_ upliftment, used it as an opportunity for holding
informal political discussions.) At the same time, thousands
of his followers continued to remain in jail, while hundreds
of individuals courted arrest participating afresh in the
_civil disobedience_. In other words, though the _civil disobedience_
was not formally withdrawn, its authentic spokesman
and its topmost leader was outside jail engaged in activities
not directly related with politics!

This naturally fostered discontent among the ranks. In
the circumstances, the advocates of parliamentary activity,
on the one side, and the leftists, including those with Socialist-Communist
outlook, on the other, tried to extend their
respective influence both inside the Congress and in the
country at large. Meanwhile, utilizing the mounting difference
of opinion and confusion among the Congress ranks
and leadership, the government came out heavily to completely
suppress the Congress.

It was in these circumstances that on 7th April 1934
Gandhi, the top-most leader of _civil disobedience movement_
and its authentic spokesman, came out with a statement.
The content of that statement can be summarized as follows:

1. The reports he had been receiving on the activities
of friends engaged in _civil disobedience_ were causing great
concern. It appeared that many of them did not really and
fully accept the theory of _satyagraha_.
2. The spiritual atmosphere necessary for a mass
_satyagraha_ struggle was lacking among the people. _Satyagraha_
was purely a spiritual weapon.
3. For these reasons, everybody except himself should
keep aloof from _individual satyagraha_. When he heard the
"call from within", he would offer _Individual Satyagraha_.

Bereft of the language of spiritualism that Gandhi
usually employed, it means, in common man's language, that
Gandhi had decided to stop not only the mass struggle which
was started in January 1932 but also its reduced version
of _Individual Satyagraha_ of August 1933. What prompted
Gandhi to lake this decision was concrete political conditions
devoid of all elements of spiritualism. As pointed out by
Nehru, the _civil disobedience movement_ in its practical
sense, was dead in May 1933. The statement made by
Gandhi in April 1934 was only the formal recognition of
its death.
