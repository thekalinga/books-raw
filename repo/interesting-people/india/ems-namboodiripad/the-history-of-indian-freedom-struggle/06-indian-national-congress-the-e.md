# INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS: THE EARLY YEARS

## THE ENGLISH FRIENDS

The political agitations initiated in Bombay, Calcutta,
Madras and other towns by the educated middle class
had the support of a section of Englishmen, too. Many of
them had, in fact, played an active role in developing this
political agitation and in giving it an organized form.

Among these Englishmen, Allan Octavian Hume
(1829--1912) is worthy of special mention. Hume, born in
England as the son of one of the leaders of the Radical Party
of England, joined the Indian Civil Service and came over to
India. He had occupied many high official positions. Hume
had, even while in service, many friends among the educated
middle class. He understood the nationalistic sentiments that
had developed among them and supported the movement that
was developing as a consequence. On retirement from service,
he began openly expressing his sympathies with the political
movement. Hume also played an important role in the preliminary
work connected with the formation of the _Indian
National Congress_, in 1885. Historians have even conferred
on him the epithet of "founder of the Congress".

Hume was, however, not an isolated individual. Lord
Dufferin, who was the Governor-General and Viceroy during
the days of the formation of the Congress, had also not
concealed from his friends his sympathies with the movement
that was developing among the educated. When Hume formulated
his plan for the formation of the _Indian National
Congress_, he had the blessings and good wishes of Dufferin.

The latter had specified only one condition to Hume that
the role he had played should not be revealed till he relinquished
office and left India.

This stand was not one which was taken casually by two
individuals, Dufferin and Hume. In fact, it was the historical
development of a relatively long period that led them to take
this stand.

Ever since India, as vast a country as it was, came under
the direct rule of the British, there existed two main trends of
opinion amongst the rulers as to how they should exercise
their domination over the several millions of people of this
country. One approach was to adopt a policy of using the
brutal forces of law and arms. The other approach was one
of building a social foundation for the British rule in India,
by creating a generation of people "imbued with English
culture", giving encouragement and assistance to the people
to foster the ideology of _bourgeois_ liberalism amongst them
and encouraging the sections and organizations imbued with
this ideology.

Broadly speaking, the Conservative and the Liberal
parties that constituted the active force in British politics
were the symbols of these two approaches --- the Conservative
Party symbolized the policy of "iron fist" and the Liberal Party
symbolized the policy of "conciliation". When the working
class became a force to be reckoned with in British politics
by the middle of the 19th century, the Chartist movement
that represented the working class expressed its warm sympathies
towards the nationalist movement in India.

Ernest Jones (1819--69) was a revolutionary, who actively
participated in the Chartist movement and had consequently
to undergo imprisonment. When the _Sepoy Mutiny_ and the
_people's revolt_ broke out in India in 1857, he had through the
columns of his newspaper wholeheartedly welcomed these
movements. Jones wrote: One cannot be in doubt as to which
side one should align himself. On which side were they, when
the Polish people waged their liberation struggle against
Russia? When the Hungarian people fought for their rights
against Austria, on which side were they? When the Italians
fought against the authoritarianism of Germany, France and of
the Pope, on which side were they? In case there was justice
on the side of Italy, or of Poland, then there is justice on the
side of India, too. Can one justify Hungary's struggle? Then
we can justify India's too. Does Italy deserve our support?
Then India, too, deserves our support. Because India is also
trying to secure what Poland, Hungary or Italy had tried to
secure.

Not only Ernest Jones, who stood firm on the side of
the working class, but even a section of the _bourgeois_ politicians
of England adopted this approach. And its echoes
were heard in the ruling circles.

It has been stated earlier that several high government
officials and members of Parliament had expressed the opinion
that the struggle of 1857--59 was not just a _Sepoy Mutiny_
but a _people's revolt_. It is true that the government acted
in a manner diametrically opposed to this opinion. Still,
this opinion persisted strongly. That was what was reflected
in the policies of the Conservative and Liberal parties towards
India. The _bourgeois_ democrats in India were striving
to solve the country's problems by maintaining cordial relations
with the leaders of the Liberal Party as well as with
the officials who were pursuing their line of approach and
soliciting their assistance. That was why the Indian political
leaders decided to depute a delegation to England to seek the
support of the members of Parliament when the India Bill of 1853 came up for their consideration. It was also for the
same reason that the political agitators in India made attempts
again to mobilize public opinion in England, in favour
of India when several lively issues like the Press Act and the
debarring of Indians from appointments in services arose.

This attitude on the part of Indians had its impact
on the rulers too, The policies of the British Government
towards India changed in accordance with the character of
the party in power. When power changed alternately between
the Conservative and Liberal parties, there were changes in
the attitudes of the Governor-General and other officials sent
by the respective parties to India, as well.

Among the Governor-Generals, Lord Lytton who was
appointed during the Conservative regime and Lord Ripon,
who came to India during the Liberal Party's regime, deserve
special mention. Legislative measures like the Act for the
suppression of freedom of the press, which met with
protests from the Indian people, were enacted during the
regime of Lytton, while that Act was withdrawn after the
assumption of office by Lord Ripon.

Further, it was during the regime of Lord Ripon that
local self-governing bodies like municipalities and _taluk_ boards
were constituted, thereby giving rise to the impression
that the national demand for involvement of the people of
India in the areas of legislative work and day-to-day administration
was being granted in its primary form. Therefore,
Indian political leaders had a special regard and affection for
Ripon. In 1884, when he left India on relinquishing office,
farewell demonstrations were held in various parts of the
country. This was something new to the English bureaucrats.
One of the officials among them, the then Finance Member
Sir Auckland was astonished at this gesture and even wrote a
book on it. These incidents are mentioned here to point out that
in the relation among the British administrators themselves
and between them and the Indian people, there were two
distinct elements, one of hatred and the other of cordiality. It
was one of these elements that was reflected in the attitude of
the former British official, Hume, the founder of the _Indian
National Congress_, and the then Governor-General, Lord
Dufferin.

The picture will not be complete unless we state the
objective circumstances that induced them to take up this
stand. The political reality directly witnessed by Hume and
Lord Dufferin was as much significant in this context as were
the ideas of liberalism that had influenced a section of the
_bourgeois_ rulers of England. This compelled them to think
hard.

The rapidly growing discontent among the educated
people on issues like adequate share for Indians in government
services, the constitutional structure, rights and powers
of the legislative councils, etc., and parallel to this, the discontent
of the people on the burning problems of life which
sometimes converged --- this was the reality of the situation
that people like Hume perceived.

The discontent both among the common people and the
educated middle class had spread all over the country. The
riots that burst out in 1859 in the indigo plantations in Bengal
were the result of the convergence of these two streams.
The British owners of these plantations used to behave brutally
towards the workers and the farmers. This led to growing
dissatisfaction in many areas creating waves of protest
among the educated middle class, too. Deena Bandhu Mitra,
one of the leaders of the cultural renaissance movement in
Bengal, wrote a drama, "Neel Darpan", exposing the cruel
exploitation by the plantation owners. Another leader of
the renaissance movement, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, translated
this drama into English. This led to court proceedings
and to the conviction of the accused. The case created
a wide-spread wave of agitation on an unprecedented scale
which compelled the Government to effect some changes in the
relations between the plantation owners and indigo farmers.

The famine which spread all over the country in the 1870s created an explosive situation in the rural areas, although
it did not lead to a combined agitation by the educated
and the common people as in the case of the movement of
the indigo farmers. The reports that the government received
from various districts one after another were alarming.
Hume who was holding a very high official position at that
time, feared that a wide-spread revolt in one form or another
would break out. He also realized that if the new landlords
and the educated sections were to take up the leadership of
this revolt, it would lead to a dangerous situation to the
British rulers.

It was quite natural that in such a situation, many other
British officials, and even the Governor-General Dufferin for
that matter, shared the opinion with Hume. Not only his
loyalty to the _bourgeois_ liberal ideology but also the eagerness
to protect the British rule from the danger it was facing brought
them close to the educated politicians in India. They
came to realize that the formation of an organization under
the leadership of this section of politicians of India was essential
to channelize in the "right way" the discontent that
was rapidly spreading all over the country.

Following this, while efforts were being made by Hume
to form the _Indian National Congress_, Surendranath Banerji
was moving on a parallel line towards a national conference
which was held in Calcutta in December 1883. A second
conference was also held subsequently.

It was when the second conference was in session that
the first conference to form the _Indian National Congress_
was held in Bombay in 1885. By that time Surendranath Banerji
had come to be regarded as an acclaimed leader throughout
the country. Yet, he had not participated in the Bombay
conference. On the other hand, W.C Banerji, who had kept
away from the Calcutta conference, not only attended the
Bombay conference but also presided over it.

The circumstance which led to the formation of two
parallel organizations was an issue of controversy. One
argument was that Hume and Dufferin considered that
a leadership role for Surendranath Banerji, who had been
dismissed from Government service and had become well
known as the leader of agitation, would not help the formation
of an organization of the type envisaged by them. It was
on that ground the National Congress was formed in place of
the national conference led by Banerji. Another argument
was that because of the lack of proper communication facilities
among the various organizations working in different
parts of the country, the two conferences were held unwittingly
at the same time.

As far as we are concerned, it is not a relevant question
which of the two views was correct. For, whatever might
have been the circumstance under which the _Indian National
Congress_ was formed, Surendranath Banerji and his friends
did join that organization before long and played a leading
role in it as much as he did in the Calcutta conference earlier.
He himself has stated that he and his other 'moderates' friends
had participated in almost all the conferences of the _Indian
National Congress_, after its inaugural session held in Bombay
in 1885, till they left the organization in 1917.

In 1885, all those who had become well known through
their public activities had participated either in the second
Calcutta conference led by Surendranath Banerji or in the
first conference of the _Indian National Congress_. An all
India organization which can be said to be of the _bourgeois_
nationalist movement in India thus emerged in 1885--86. The
_bourgeois_ modernization movement which started through
the different branches such as the social reform movement
in the forms of _Brahma Samaj_ and other organizations and
the cultural renaissance movements that emerged simultaneously
with it, the political ideologies and agitations that emerged
as part of these cultural and social movements, and the Indian
political economy initiated by Naoroji and others, attained a
clear all-India political form. And in the emergence of this
movement, the British officials like Hume and Dufferin, who
were under the influence of the Liberal Party of England and
the liberal political approach that controlled it, played an
active role.

## TOWARDS CONFRONTATION

As we have seen, the Congress which was started under
the initiative of Hume and with the knowledge of the
Governor-General had received the assistance and co-operation
from the British officials in India in its initial days. The
Governor-General had invited the delegates to the second
conference of the Congress in Calcutta in 1886, to his official
residence for a treat. Similarly, when the next conference
was held in Madras, the Governor of that province entertained
the delegates to the conference at his official residence.

But a radical change came about in the official attitude
towards the organization when the activities of the Congress
became intensified and the leaders decided to raise the
demand for _administrative reforms_ more vigorously. Perhaps
not quite in line with the expectation of the official circle,
the Congress did not remain content with holding a meeting
once in a year and dispersing after passing certain resolutions.
Instead, the Congress got itself engaged in mobilizing
public opinion by publishing pamphlets and other materials
sharply criticizing the policies pursued by the government
and conducting campaigns by holding public meetings. And
the top echelons of the officialdom veered round to the view
that no Englishman employed in government service should
associate with the activities of the Congress or express
sympathy for it. Earlier, officials used to attend the meetings
of the Congress, which had now been banned.

The very same Lord Dufferin who had encouraged Hume
in his efforts to form the _Indian National Congress_, later
wrote:

>There is a mischievous busybody of the name Hume
whom Lord Ripon rather feted and who seems to be one of
the chief stimulators of the Indian _Home Rule_ movement,
He is cleverish, a little cracked, vain, unscrupulous man...
very careless of truth.[^06/1]

[^06/1]: Quoted in Tara Chand, _Ibid_, p. 554.

As we have seen, the main demands of the Congress
were active role for the Indians in the administration and,
as part of it, ending the monopoly of Englishman in government
employment. The British authorities in India and
England took a totally negative attitude towards this demand.
They made out that those who raised these demands constituted
a small minority among the Indian people and that a
large majority of the people were not interested in such
political agitations. They argued that since the "agitating
minority" were Hindu Bengalis, Muslims throughout India
and all other communities outside Bengal were against these
demands. They even went to the extent of propagating
that those who shed blood in the wars for the protection of
the interests of both England and India were the "martial
races" outside Bengal and that they were against the demands
being raised by the "cowardly Bengali Hindus". Thus,
they did all what they could to turn the "martial races"
and Muslims against the Congress.

Not only did they conduct propaganda of these sorts
they also tried to obstruct in various ways the organized functioning
of the Congress such as imposing ban on holding
meetings in certain places, putting obstacles before travels and
lodging facilities of the delegates attending conferences, and
harassing those who were in the forefront of agitational and
organizational activities. The congress had to face all these
difficulties to function effectively.

However, none of these reduced the trust the congress
leaders had in the British rule or the sympathy of those leaders
who were taking active part in the British political life
towards the congress. Besides Hume, there were many non-official
Englishman who had taken part in the organizational
activities of the Congress. Some of them had been even
elected as president of the Congress. Charles Bradlaugh, a
British MP, had visited India and directly assisted the
political agitations of the Congress. Later he moved a bill
in the House of Commons incorporating the demands raised
by the Congress. The Congress, on its part, sent a delegation
to England, which included, among Firozeshah Mehta,
WC Banerji, Surendranath Banerji, RN Mudholkar and
others, two Englishman, Hume and Elderly Norton.

The Government could not just ignore these agitations
jointly conducted by the _Congressmen_ in India and their
English friends in England. When Bradlaugh introduced
his bill in the House of Commons, the Government moved
another bill in the House of Lords. Although the objects of
the latter bill were stated to be the explanation of the representative
character of the Central legislature and its rights and
privileges, it was inadequate to serve the purpose, since the
bill was really meant for "increasing the opportunities of the
Government for acquainting itself with the wishes and feelings
of a select section of upper class Indians". Moreover,
Lord Curzon, introducing the bill on behalf of the Government,
categorically stated that "for the illiterate and voiceless
millions who constituted the people of India, no system of
representative government could be devised".[^06/2]

[^06/2]: Tara Chand, _Ibid_, p. 564.

The demand of the Congress was the right of the people
to elect the members of the legislature which was strongly
supported by a section among the members in the Parliament.
However, the 1892 Act rejected even the conception of
election and introduced, instead, the system of nominating
the members by the Governor-General, subject to the
approval of the British Government.

The provision was to nominate six additional official
members and 10 non-official members to the Central Legislative
Council. This proportion of the newly nominated
members was fixed in such a away as to ensure that the non-official
members in the council did not constitute a majority
in the Council.

The provision was to nominate four out of 10 non-official
members on the recommendation of the provincial legislatures,
one on the recommendation of the Chambers of Commerce
of Calcutta and the remaining five members at the Governor
General's discretion. In nominating members in the last
category, representation to the Muslim and other communities
was to be considered, thus adopting the principle of communal
representation for the first time.

Not only the structure of the Central Legislative Council,
but also the rights and privileges of the members, both
accepted and denied, did not satisfy the Congress. Although
members had the right to interpellate and to discuss the
budget after its presentation in the House, they did not have
the right to vote on the budget. It is needless to say that
even if the right to vote to members was allowed, there was
no question of defeating the Government in the House in which
nominated members constituted a majority. As such, the denial
of voting right to the members, as also the denial of the right
to the people to elect non-official members revealed the real
purpose of the Government. This revealed that the Government
would not give the people's representatives a place in
the legislature, nor would it concede even the official members
enjoying the confidence of the Government the right to vote
in the House.

It was within a period of seven years of the formation
of the Congress that a bill with such unsatisfactory provisions
was passed in the British Parliament. And even for this, the
Congress in India and its English friends, including members
of Parliament, in England had to do hard work. And all of
them were, without exception, people with unflinching loyalty
to the British rule. In every conference or meeting, speeches
were delivered and resolutions passed declaring loyalty to the
British royal family and government. Despite all these, the
British government rejected even the 'moderate' demands
raised through legitimate means by an organization led by
these "out-and-out loyalists".

Naturally, a thought arose among some _congressmen_ whether it was not advisable in the prevailing circumstances
to give up the path so far pursued and to adopt other means
of struggle. This thinking, in fact, led to the emergence of
a new (radical) leadership against the ('moderate') leadership
in the Congress of the earlier days. We shall return to the
emergence and growth of this new leadership later. Presently
we shall only examine the nature of the changes that came about
in the relationship between the new landlord-_bourgeois_ classes
which gave birth to the Congress, and the British rulers.

As pointed out earlier, a section of the trading _bourgeoisie_
in India had gradually transformed themselves into industrial
capitalists, after the British capitalists who first came as
traders consolidated their power and entered the sphere of
industrial production in a limited way in India.

It was the clash between these forces that was basic to
the critiques of Indian political economy by Naoroji, Ranade
and Dutt and the agitations based on these critiques. Basic
to the demand raised by the Congress for elected people's
representatives and for an administration under their control
was the desire to have a government to realize the hopes and
aspirations of the Indian _bourgeoisie_ which was developing
gradually.

This contradiction between the British and Indian _bourgeoisie_
was, however, getting intensified day by day. For, under
the firmly rooted British rule, _Capitalism_ was developing and
the major share of this development was that of the British
and a small portion, of the Indian capitalists. This situation
led, on the one side, to the intensification of the dissatisfaction
among the Indian capitalists and, on the other, to the growth
of self-confidence that they would be in a position to exert
pressure on the rulers through organized agitation. Thus, the
Congress was waging a battle for the needs of a class which
had emerged with growing dissatisfaction, on the one side,
and with developing self-confidence, on the other.

_Monopoly Capitalism_ emerged on a global basis during
the closing years of the 19th century and the beginning of
the 20th century. As an inevitable consequence of this, the
contradictions between the dominant monopoly capitalists
and other sections of capitalists intensified, resulting in fierce
conflicts between them. As a matter of fact, it was as a part
of this development that contradictions arose between the
ruling British _bourgeoisie_ and the Indian _bourgeoisie_ which
was aspiring for power.

By the closing years of the 19th century, Indian capitalists
had attained a considerably strong position in the cotton
textile industry. They had even gone ahead of the British in
this industry by the year 1898. (Out of the capital invested
in this industry, two thirds belonged to India, and the
remaining one-third to the British.) But, in the jute, woollen,
paper, sugar, tea, coffee and indigo sectors, three-fourths of
the capital was British owned. Indians lagged behind not only
in the matter of ownership of the capital and in the management,
but also in the number of highly skilled technical
hands like engineers. The Indian capitalists naturally desired
to develop overcoming these weaknesses.

The contradictions between the British and Indian capitalists
were getting intensified in the background of the
situation in which the people of India as a whole were being
subjected to exploitation and misery under the British rule.
In all other countries, one of the natural consequences
of the development of _Capitalism_ was a reduction in the
number of workers engaged in agriculture and other related
spheres and an increase in the number of workers employed
in industry and mining. What happened in India was the opposite.
The percentage of those employed in industries and other
related establishments decreased from 16 in 1881 to 15 in 1901.
On the other hand, the percentage of those engaged in the
agricultural and other related sectors increased to 75 from 74
during the same period. In other words, without economic
progress and modernization which should have resulted from
development of _Capitalism_, India became a victim of increasing
misery arising out of it.

William Digby, a British economist, was one who had
fully sympathized with the national aspirations of the people
of India. In the estimation of the national income of India,
William Digby ranks next only to Dadabhoy Naoroji.
According to his estimate, India's national income during the
early years of the 20th century was 392.4 million pound
sterling. Of this, 50 million pounds were appropriated by the
princes, _Zamindars_ and other feudal lords. Bankers and _mofussil_
moneylenders and rich traders, numbering only 75,000,
appropriated 75 million pounds. An equal amount went into
the hands of 750,000 small and medium size traders.

Thus, while an amount as high as 200 million pound sterling
passed into the hands of a minority consisting of feudal
lords and traders, a large majority of the common people
received only 190 million pounds.

Digby's estimate revealed that while the contradiction
between the Indian and British _bourgeoisie_ were intensifying,
the contradiction between the _feudal-bourgeois_ classes and
the masses of people had also become a factor which could
not be ignored. This latter contradiction was, in a sense, a
part of the former. This was because, as pointed out earlier,
following the suppression of the revolt of 1857--59, the British
rulers had deliberately pursued a policy of appeasing the
feudal lords. As a result of this policy, not only the princes
and the big landlords, but even the moneylenders and wholesale
traders intensified their exploitation of the people, and
it was as an inevitable result of this that recurrent famines
broke out in various regions of the country during the
closing years of the 19th century.

Out of the 49 years from 1860 to 1908, 20 were famine
years. Many of these famines resulted in large-scale starvation
deaths. The toll of famine deaths was five million in 1876--77, 4.5 million in 1896--97 and 1.25 million in the year 1899--1900.
The famines tell the story of the cruel feudal exploitation.

The famines and other forms of miseries of the people
were issues highlighted by the Congress in the _anti-British_
agitation. In the annual conferences of the Congress as well
as in the local conferences, attention was focussed on these
issues in the speeches delivered and resolutions passed. Relief
operations were organized in the famine stricken areas by
social workers. As part of the activities connected with such
issues, _Congressmen_ also carried on propaganda severely
criticizing the policies of the government. That was why
the Congress was able to turn itself as an organization rallying
the common people --- first the poor middle class and
gradually the workers and peasants --- behind the Indian _bourgeoisie_
which was fighting against the British _bourgeoisie_
to protect its own class interest.

## HINDU REVIVALISM: THE UGLY FACE OF NATIONALISM

In the previous sections we have referred to the various
movements in India developed with the objects of liberating
the country from the British rule and leading the society on
modern _bourgeois_ lines. We have seen that the common
factor underlying all these movements was the modern _bourgeois_
political development and that the _Indian National
Congress_ was the logical extension of this development.

Another movement, distinct from them though it may
appear, but playing an active role in the development of
_bourgeois_ nationalism, also emerged in the same period.
This was the movement for the revival of ancient Indian
culture and religious beliefs, the traces of which could be
found in the movement of social reforms and cultural renaissance
led by Raja Ram Mohan Roy. It may be recalled that
Ram Mohan Roy who took the initiative in modernizing
Hindu society, its customs and practices, strongly opposed
the propagation of Christianity and the evangelical mission
of the priests. In the process of modernization visualized
by him, he incorporated elements of the ancient Hindu culture,
Thus the movements for social reform and cultural
renaissance like the _Brahma Samaj_ of Bengal and the _Prarthana
Samaj_ of Maharashtra emerged as movements of Hindu
revivalism, although they put emphasis on modernization.

Some other movements like the one led by Jyotiba
Phule of Maharashtra were, as we have already noticed,
based on the slogan of upliftment of the backward castes,
including the untouchables. The aim of these movements
was to raise socially and culturally the communities oppressed
under the caste system which was an integral part of the
Hindu social system, by purveying them the wealth of the
ancient Indian culture. For them, cultural renaissance and
Hindu revivalism were merged together. (The most manifest
form of this movement in Kerala was the movement started
by Sri Narayana by establishing temples and monasteries
exclusively for the _non-Caste Hindus_.)

Simultaneously, attempts were also being made to revive
the ancient Hindu culture independently of the movements
for modernizing the Hindu society. Typical examples of
such movements were those started by Sri Ramakrishna
and Vivekananda in Bengal, the _Arya Samaj_ movement of
Dayanand Saraswati in Punjab, and the Theosophical Society
of South India (this movement was formed in other
regions of India also, but it was not as popular there as it
was in the South). These movements, however, contributed
indirectly to the growth of _bourgeois_ nationalist movement.

Following the suppression of the revolt of 1857--59, a
general feeling had developed among Indians that the administrative
and socio-cultural systems of the British were superior
to the Indian social system and culture. The attempts
made by the _bourgeois_ social reformers and political leaders,
from Raja Ram Mohan Roy to the founders of the _Indian
National Congress_, were to end this condition and to modernize
Indian society and establish a political-administrative
system which could be on a par with the British system.

The Ramakrishna-Vivekananda movement, the _Arya
Samaj_ and the Theosophical Society, on the other hand,
tried to create a feeling among the people that there was no
basis at all for their inferiority complex. The basic approach
of Swami Vivekananda, Dayanand Saraswati, Madame
Blavatsky and other leaders who initiated the Hindu revivalist
movements, was based on their claim that an advanced
civilization existed in India when the ancestors of the present
British rulers were living like savages. They also claimed
that although some distortions and deviations affected the
culture for some time subsequently, the people of India could
revive and re-enliven that ancient Hindu culture by overcoming
the ill-effects of the distortions and deviations.
They asserted further that if the people of India strove to
carry out this process of revival, they could challenge and
end the Western domination. Of all these movements, the
one started by Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was the most
prominent. Brought up in an orthodox atmosphere, he
reached the Dakshineswar temple where from he conducted
his early activities as the priest of the temple. Soon his
name spread as a man of peace who would solve the problems
of his devotees through sacrifice. In short, he was a
devout person and an idealist untouched by even a tinge of
_bourgeois_ social reform, cultural renaissance or urge for
national independence.

Nevertheless, even under this idealism and spiritualism
Sri Ramakrishna's preachings and deeds did provide a
fertile soil for the growth of modern _bourgeois_ nationalism.
For, although born and brought up in an atmosphere of
absolute orthodoxy, his teachings and practices contained
elements which were distasteful to orthodox Hindu culture.
His spiritual teachings and practices surmounted religious
and caste distinctions. He tried to convert people into devotees
of _Kali_ and _Shiva_, whether they be _Brahmins_ or _non-Brahmins_,
Muslims or Christians. In fact, he became the priest of
the temple of _Kali_, challenging the then existing communal
practices and customs. Later, he also tried to adjust himself
with Muslims and Christians by studying their scriptures
and practices.

Thus, he built a new spiritual movement which,
although devoid of modernism, stood above the caste distinction,
religious superstitions and prejudices which were
considered as black spots in the fabric of the Hindu society.

Even the new generation of the _bourgeois_ intellectuals
working with the aim of modernizing the society and holding
modern outlook which was distinctly different from that of
Ramakrishna, were attracted towards him. Lawyers, doctors,
professors, high officials in government service and such
others became the disciples of Sri Ramakrishna. Many
scholars engaged in a comparative study of the philosophy
of Hinduism and of ancient Greece and modern Europe
designed to establish the superiority of Indian culture and
civilisation found Ramakrishna's spiritual teachings and
practice of meditation attractive. The eminent leader of
social reform and cultural renaissance in Bengal, Keshab
Chandra Sen, was one among such scholars.

One of the young disciples of Ramakrishna who rose to
eminence and fame was Narendranath Dutt. He was attracted
towards Sri Ramakrishna at a time when he (Narendra
Dutt) was seeking some means to overcome certain family
problems after the completion of higher education. He soon
became a disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, and after the demise
of his master, became the foremost amongst the founders
of an order of _Sanyasins_ pledged to propagate the message of
teachings of Sri Ramakrishna throughout the world. As the
leader of the order of _Sanyasins_, he adopted the name of
Swami Vivekananda, and it was in this name that he, later
on, became famous.

The tours Vivekananda conducted to propagate the
message of Sri Ramakrishna throughout India and abroad
were ostensibly a movement for the propagation of Hindu
religion. But in effect, it turned out to be a movement for
the resurgence of India's soul which was being trampled
upon by foreign rulers and for challenging their culture.
The address he delivered at the world religious convention
held in Chicago and the appreciation it received from the
intellectuals of the Western world helped Indians to overcome
their sense of inferiority. It also helped to bring into
conscience the feeling that the Indian people were inheritors
of a cultural legacy capable of challenging the foreign
overlords dominating them.

Like those of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda's discourses
were also concerned ostensibly with spiritual matters. He
tried to interpret and propagate the ideology of _Vedanta_. But,
unlike Ramakrishna, Vivekananda in his discourses and correspondence
made observations, even overtly to some extent,
that were helpful to the development of modern _bourgeois_
nationalist movement. He even made statements which were
apparently against the religious establishment and priests. For
instance, as disclosed by one of his disciples, Vivekananda
once stated that when poverty and misery were rampant in
the country, it was not the time to give religious speeches.
"After these were abolished he would give religious discourses."
He also expressed at times the views that the poor,
the destitute and the weak were the real gods, and that
priests should be kicked out. The urge for national independence
could be discerned throughout his discourses.

The _Arya samaj_ which emerged in Punjab under the
leadership of Dayanand Saraswati was in many respects
different from the movement that developed under the leadership
of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. The _Arya samaj_
was formed as a movement which directly came into clash
with Islam and Christianity. Lectures and other literature
published under the auspices of the _Arya Samaj_ openly
criticized and condemned Islam and Christianity. It was the
_Arya Samaj_ that raised the issue of banning cow slaughter
which later on led to Hindu-Muslim riots. Books like the
_Satyartha Prakash_ written by Dayanand Saraswati, which
created religious prejudices leading to communal clashes were
of the same nature as the anti-Hindu books published by
foreign missionaries. Nevertheless, there was much in common
between the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda movement and the
_Arya Samaj_. Both the movements were proud of the heritage
of the ancient Hindu civilization. In that sense, both the
movements showed the tendency to keep away from the
non-Hindus in India, instead of building unity with them.
This approach helped only to isolate the non-Hindus from
the struggle against foreign domination, to the same proportion
as it helped to attract Hindu masses to _anti-British_
struggle by creating the feeling that national independence
meant the revival of ancient Hindu culture.

The Theosophical Society was a movement which did
not manifest such a defect. The reason for this was that it
did not develop into a long-standing all-India movement as
did the other two movements. This relatively short-lived
movement remained confined to South India. This movement
attained popularity and eminence only at the close of the
First World War when one of the eminent leaders of the
movement, Dr (Mrs) Annie Besant, organized the _Home
Rule_ Movement against the British rule. And at that time it
was a movement striving to organize all sections of the Indian
people on the basis of a single political slogan above religious
considerations.

The move for Hindu revivalism in India was, however,
not confined to these three movements. In fact, the Hindu
revivalist movement acquired, in the beginning, the position
of a movement integral to the left-wing nationalism that
emerged following the formation of _Indian National Congress_.
The 'extremist' section of the Congress led by leaders
like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the secret revolutionary organizations
which were formed in various parts of the country were all
linked with the Hindu revivalist movement. The Ganesh festival
organized by Tilak, the _Durga Pooja_ and _Kali Pooja_ organized
by the revolutionaries of Bengal, and the _Ayyappa Seva
Sangh_ of Kerala and various other organizations formed in
line with them were the products of the Hindu revivalism
developed under the _bourgeois_ nationalist movement. And
the ideology behind these organizations was the intellectual
creations of Hindu _intelligentsia_, like Bankim Chandra
Chatterjee who raised the slogan of _Bande Mataram_ in accordance
with the concept of _Bharat Mata_ (Mother India). In
this ideology can be seen the eagerness to attain independence
with the blessings of the goddess Devi, the "annihilator of
the enemy".

It may be stated that the urge for Hindu revivalism
represented the inherent weakness of _bourgeois_ nationalism
that had attained maturity with the emergence of the _Indian
National Congress_. For, the movement had to take into
account the religious sentiments of the Hindus who formed
a majority of the population, if it wanted to become popular
among the masses beyond the limited circle of educated
elites. It had to conduct campaign in a style and language
corresponding to these sentiments and, for that purpose, had
to create symbols and epics. So they had to devise such
agitational programmes as would rouse the people against
the foreign rulers, on the one hand, as was the case with the
_Ganeshotsav_ and _Sivaji Utsav_ organized by Tilak, and against
other sections of the people like the Muslims and others, on
the other.

There was another side of the coin. When a Hindu
revivalist movement is organized as part of nationalism, it is
but natural that a counter-movement of Islamic revivalism
should emerge. When these two revivalist movements came
into a clash with each other, the contradictions between the
higher and lower castes within the Hindu society would come
out, with the latter along with other religious minorities like
the Sikhs and Christians, building their own characteristic
revivalist movements. The British rulers naturally tried to
intensify and utilize these contradictions among the various
sections of the people to cause the disintegration of the
national movement.

This was what really happened. Needless to say that 15th August 1947 represented the final act of the tragic drama
which resulted from it.

## THE BEGINNINGS OF ISLAMIC POLITICS

We have already noticed that the Muslims as a community
played a more active role than the Hindus as a rule, in
the 1857--59 uprisings and which led ultimately to the emergence
of the _Indian National Congress_. They had generally kept
themselves aloof from the 'extremist' and mass movements
that had taken place in the course of the growth of the
Congress. Except for a few individual Muslims, it was the
Hindus who provided the leadership and the ranks to these
movements.

Besides, it was the Muslim elites who lent their support
to the British rulers when the latter unleashed repression
against the 'extremist' and mass movements, on the plea that
the development of these forces posed a "danger". And the
Muslim masses, on the other hand, could not participate in
the _anti-imperialist_ movement because of this stance of the
elites.

When the British established their domination over
India, it was the Muslim Emperor of Delhi and the _Nawabs_
under him that lost the ruling power. As such, a feeling
grew up among the Muslims, irrespective of their social position,
that the British usurped power in India, dethroning the
Muslim rulers who were in power for a few centuries. The
_anti-British_ feelings that developed as a consequence led to
several local revolts culminating in the revolt of 1857--59.

There is also another factor which deserves special
mention in this context. In a number of countries to the west
of India the rulers were Muslims. The majority of the population
of those countries was also Muslim. Of these, Turkey
was ruled by the _Khalif_ who was the revered leader of the
entire Islamic world. The British and the other imperialist
powers of the Western world were waging aggressive wars
against these Islamic countries, including Turkey, and were
forcibly occupying them.

Britain was growing as an imperialist power, having her
sway over a vast area embracing Turkey, Egypt, the Arab
countries, Iran and northern Africa. France, Russia and
other capitalist powers were also growing in a similar way.
Consequently, indignation of the Muslims was rising against
the Western imperialist powers in general and against Britain
in particular. This was what motivated the Muslims to
actively participate in the various _anti-British_ revolts, including
the revolt of 1857--59. This also made the Muslims
desist from sending their children to modern educational
institutions established by the British. Thus, while the richer
sections of other communities were striving to modernize
their social life through modern education, adopting the mode
of life of the educated and entering the field of _bourgeois_
financial enterprises, the richer sections of the Muslim community
kept themselves aloof from such efforts. Their
children continued to carry on their education in the traditional
_Madrassas_. The lifestyle and outlook of the richer
sections were also those of the old feudal society. And the
community did not provide social reformers and leaders
like Ram Mohan Roy, Ranade and Naoroji.

In short, no social reform and cultural renaissance
movements were built up by the Muslim community. Nor
did they develop modern politico-economic thoughts as products
of such social and cultural movements. The Muslim
community in general, with the exception of a handful of
individuals, had kept itself aloof from the organizations
formed in various regions before the formation of the _Indian
National Congress_ and even from the Congress after it was
formed.

There were, of course, a few individuals among Muslims
who came to realize that such an attitude was dangerous.
These individuals were aware of the strength of Britain and
other imperialist powers, as also of the circumstance that
led to their acquiring this strength. They also realized that
it would be disastrous to repeat the revolts of the type that
took place in 1857--59. They were convinced that they could
advance as a community only if their children were provided
with opportunities for acquiring modern education and
adopted other means for bringing about modernization.
Clashes occurred frequently between them and those who
wanted to live the life as before.

Syed Ahmed Khan was one of the eminent leaders who
took position in the progressive camp and fought against
the orthodox sections. Like Raja Ram Mohan Roy and others,
Syed Ahmed Khan also stood for social reforms and cultural
renaissance. He was well-known for introducing modernization
in the Muslim community and the _resultant_ renaissance.
His contributions in the field of education in particular are
significant.

The _Mohammedan_ Anglo-Oriental School, started in 1874, was upgraded to a college in 1878. This institution
was later developed into the present Aligarh Muslim University
which played a very important role in the modernization
of the Muslim community. The teachers as well as the young
generation Muslims who got education in that University
were capable of shining not only in the field of education
but also in different aspects of the social and political life.
These efforts, which later came to be known as the "Aligarh
Movement" helped to bring about a transformation in the
Muslim community, in the same way the diverse movements
ranging from _Brahma Samaj_ to the _Indian National Congress_
brought about transformation in India as a whole. Thus,
this educational institution came to be the centre of social
reform and cultural renaissance movements of the Muslim
community.

Ahmed Khan's view and outlook were distinctly different
from those of his contemporary Muslim scholars and the
other leaders of the Muslim community. Even in matters
relating to religion, his views and those of the _Ulemas_ came
to clash with each other. His interpretation of Islamic religious
ideas and theories was not relished by the _Ulemas_ and
other orthodox sections among the community. He gave vent
to his opinion, as opposed to the view held by other leaders
of his own community, that the _Sultan_ of Turkey had no
rights as the _Khalif_.

Though Syed Ahmed Khan started his activities holding
modern religious views, experience taught him that if he held
fast to these views he might alienate the common people of
his community. Consequently, he confined himself to activities
in the field of education. He knew quite well that the
transformations in the field of education would inevitably
exert an influence in all the other fields and that the Aligarh
Movement would develop into a manifold movement for
social reform.

Ahmed Khan also tried to bring about a fundamental
change in the political outlook of the Muslim elites. The
revolt of 1857--59 had made him think deeply about it, as
it did the leaders of other communities. But unlike many
other leaders, the revolt and the vindictive measures taken
by the government did not disappoint him. He, in fact,
concentrated his attention on the lessons one had to draw
from the revolt and the subsequent events.

Syed Ahmed Khan considered it essential to bring about
a fundamental change in their relationship with the British
rulers by ending the confrontation and establishing a relation
based on cooperation. He was convinced that only by
cooperating with the British authorities could the community
make progress. He tried to make the community accept this
view and in this he was successful to some extent.

Ahmed Khan developed his political approach with the
perspective of establishing a relationship of cooperation with
the non-Muslim communities too. In a book he wrote analyzing
the causes of the 1857--59 revolts, he criticized the policy
of the British authorities of keeping Indians --- both Muslim
and non-Muslim --- from higher official positions. Thus, he
made it clear that the political slogan raised by the leaders
of the non-Muslim communities before the formation of the
_Indian National Congress_ was the slogan of the Muslim
community as well.

Similarly, he laid emphasis on the importance of Hindu-Muslim
unity in many of his famous speeches. For instance,
in a speech delivered at Patna on 27th January 1883 he
told his audience that the terms Hindu and Muslim only
indicated religion. All residents of India, whether they be
Hindus, Muslims or Christians, constituted a single nation.
The days were gone when the inhabitants of a country were
regarded as different nations on the basis of religion. Similar
themes could be found expressed in his other speeches and
writings.

But a change came over in the political attitude of Syed
Ahmed Khan with the formation of the _Indian National
Congress_ in 1885. He thought that a minority community
like the Muslims would be adversely affected if the administrative
power was passed on to the elected representatives
of the people of India as demanded by the Congress. Syed
Ahmed Khan came to the conclusion that in order to avoid
such an eventuality, it was necessary for the Muslims to
organize independently and demand special status for them
in the democratic set up demanded by the Congress. This
showed that Syed Ahmed Khan began to go back from the
position he had taken earlier as expressed in his speech cited
above.

It was quite natural for the British rulers to adopt an
attitude giving all encouragement to this idea of Muslim
separatism. It was essential for them to curb at all costs
the movement for independence and democracy that was
emerging rapidly against their rule. And they cleverly utilized
the contradictions and mutual suspicion between the
Hindus and Muslims as an effective means to curb such a
movement. For instance, Lord Dufferin, the then Governor-General
of India, told a Muslim delegation

>Descended as
you are from those who formerly occupied such a commanding
position in India, you are exceptionally able to understand
the responsibility attaching to those who rule.[^06/3]

[^06/3]: Quoted in Tara Chand, _Ibid_, p. 366.

The British took particular care to rouse the feelings of
pride in the minds of the Muslim elites who considered themselves
to be the descendants of the Emperor of Delhi and of
the _Nawabs_, by making similar references both officially and
unofficially. Britons of the Aligarh College which was the
main centre of activities of Syed Ahmed Khan, too, consistently
tried to rouse these feelings among the Muslims.

All these gradually conjured up in the minds of the
educated sections of the Muslim community a feeling that a
democratic administrative set up as demanded by the Congress
posed a danger to them as a minority community and
that they must stand with the British to avoid such a situation.
Needless to say, it was this feeling that subsequently
led to the formation of the _Muslim League_ and to the frequent
clashes between the Congress and _Muslim League_ which
culminated in the division of the country into India and
Pakistan.

It must be stated specifically that the _bourgeois_ politicians
belonging to the non-Muslim communities were equally responsible,
as were the _bourgeois_ politicians of the Muslim
community and British rulers, for the development of such a
situation. For, as indicated earlier, _bourgeois_ politics of
the _Indian National Congress_ emerged and developed in
close cooperation with Hindu revivalism. All the foremost
_bourgeois_ political leaders, including Tilak and Gandhi who
were regarded as above religion and caste, used Hindu concepts
and symbols for political propaganda. Though this
was done with the good intention of attracting the attention
of the common people, they tended to create the impression
that what they meant by independence was the revival of
ancient India with Hindu domination.

This naturally created misgivings in the minds of non-Hindus,
as also among the non-Caste sections of the Hindu
community. Consequently, in order to secure their future
position, the Muslims started organizing themselves independently,
followed by Christians, Sikhs and the depressed and
backward classes among the Hindus. And the British rulers
cleverly utilized the differences and contradictions amongst
these various sections to secure their own position. These
were the factors that lay behind what later on developed into
the '_communal question_'.

The _bourgeois_ nationalists in general shut their eyes to
this reality and tried to make it appear that the communal
problem, which culminated in the division of the country
into India and Pakistan, was the creation solely of the Muslim
elites and the British rulers.
