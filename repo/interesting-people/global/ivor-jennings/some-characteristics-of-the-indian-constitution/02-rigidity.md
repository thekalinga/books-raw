# Rigidity

Bryce and Dicey have made us familiar with the classification of
Constitutions into flexible and rigid. That classification, as normally
understood, is, however, too simple. Flexibility or rigidity is
necessarily a question of degree. The British Constitution is extremely
flexible not only because any part of it can be changed by Act of
Parliament but also because so little of it is expressed in law at all.
The principles of constitutional monarchy and Cabinet Government, the
relations between the Cabinet and Parliament, the relations between
Ministers and public servants, and so on, are all regulated by
conventions, which adapt themselves to changing conditions as they
arise. A Constitution which can be changed only by some special
formality is necessarily more rigid than one which can be changed by
ordinary legislation: but the degree of rigidity depends upon two
factors. First, it depends on the degree of difficulty in the amending
process: that is, what more is needed for a constitutional amendment
than for a piece of ordinary legislation. Secondly, it depends upon the
content of the Constitution. What makes the Indian Constitution so rigid
is that, in addition to a somewhat complicated process of amendment, it
is so detailed and covers so vast a field of law that the problem of
constitutional validity must often arise.[^1]

It should first be pointed out that there are very few provisions which
allow alterations by simple majority. Constitutions which have special
amendment clauses usually contain a number of provisions which are
expressed to be in force 'until Parliament otherwise provides'. The only
provisions of this character appear to be:

1. Articles 2, 3 and 4, which enable Parliament by law to admit new
   States, form new States by altering boundaries, and accordingly
   amend the First and Fourth Schedules.
2. Article 73 (2), which retains certain powers in the States until
   otherwise provided by Parliament.
3. Articles 75, 97, 125, 148, 164 (5), 221 (2), which permit amendment
   of the Second Schedule.
4. Article 100 (3), which prescribes the parliamentary quorum until
   Parliament otherwise provides.
5. Article 105 (3) which prescribes parliamentary privilege until it is
   defined by Parliament.
6. Article 106, which prescribes the salaries and allowances of Members
   of Parliament until Parliament provides for them.
7. Article 118 (2) which prescribes rules of procedure until they have
   been made by the two Houses.
8. Article 120 (2), which omits English as a parliamentary language
   after 15 years, unless Parliament otherwise provides.
9. Article 124 (1), which provides that there shall not be more than
   seven puisne judges in the Supreme Court until Parliament otherwise
   provides.
10. Article 133 (3), which prevents an appeal from a single judge of a
    High Court to the Supreme Court, unless Parliament otherwise
    provides.
11. Article 135, which confers certain jurisdiction on the Supreme Court
    unless Parliament otherwise provides.
12. Article 169 (1), which confers a power to abolish the Legislative
    Council of a State in certain conditions.
13. Article 242 (1), which continues the constitution and functions of
    the Coorg Legislative Council.
14. Articles 343 (3) and 348 (1), which provide some flexibility in the
    official languages.

In a few cases there are similar provisions enabling the Legislature of
a State to modify constitutional provisions. It will be seen that the
provisions are few, and in the main unimportant. The exception is the
power to create new States which indicates a weakness of the States
against the Union.

The amending clause is Article 368. A constitutional amendment requires
(a) a majority of the total membership in each House; and (b) a majority
of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting in each
House.

This means that one-third of either House can defeat a constitutional
amendment by voting against it. If one-quarter votes against and
one-quarter abstains from voting the amendment is again obstructed. What
is more, if the amendment relates to what may be called the _federal
clauses_, specified in the article, it requires not only an absolute
majority in each House and a two-thirds majority of those present and
voting but also ratification by the Legislatures of onehalf of the Part
A and Part B States.

What makes the Indian Constitution so rigid, though, is not merely the
difficulty of passing an amendment, but also the length and detail of
the Constitution. It contains 395 articles and eight schedules, the
whole occupying 251 octavo pages[^2]. It must be the largest and most
detailed Constitution in the world. If we ask why this is so we find
several explanations:---

1. This is a federal Constitution which prescribes not only a
   Constitution for the Union, but also Constitutions for the States.
   Part VI, which contains 86 articles, is in reality a standard
   Constitution for Part A States, which neither a State Legislature
   nor the Parliament of the Union can amend. Part VII, which contains
   only one article, applies Part VI to Part B States. Parts VIII, IX
   and X, containing six articles, apply to Part C States and other
   special areas, and bring in the Fifth and Sixth Schedules.
2. The relations between the Union and the States are unusually
   complicated. Part XI contains 19 sections and incorporates the
   Seventh Schedule, but financial relations are covered by Part XII,
   which contains 37 articles.
3. The Constituent Assembly has thought fit to include not only a Bill
   of Rights occupying 24[^3] articles, but also Directive Principles
   of State Policy, occupying 16 articles.
4. Some matters which could have been dealt with by ordinary
   legislation, such as the organization of the judicial authorities,
   have been included in the Constitution. The Union judiciary occupies
   24 articles and the judiciary in the States requires another 24
   articles.
5. There are problems peculiar to India which, in the opinion of the
   Constituent Assembly, required specific constitutional enactment.
   They include the public services (dealt with in Part XIV --- 16
   articles); special classes like Anglo--Indians, Scheduled Castes,
   Scheduled Tribes (dealt with in Part XVI --- 13 articles); and
   official languages (dealt with in Part XVII --- 9 articles and one
   schedule).
6. Partly because of the federal system and partly because of the
   inclusion of a Bill of Rights, it has been thought necessary to
   include emergency provisions covering 9 articles.

Allowing for duplications, the above list contains 260 articles and four
schedules[^4] or roughly two-thirds of the whole Constitution.

Flexibility is regarded as a merit and rigidity a defect because it is
impossible for the framers of a Constitution to foresee the conditions
in which it would apply and the problems which will arise. They have not
the gift of prophecy. When the Constitution of the United States was
framed, it was quite impossible for the framers to know that 'trade and
commerce between the States' would be carried on by railway, motor
transport and aeroplane. The Bill of Rights was not drafted in
contemplation of the development of Hollywood and television. Nor are
changes in ideas less revolutionary. The 'American way of life' is a
product of the conditions of this generation as well as of past history.
The Congress of the United States has to take the lead in policies
affecting Europe and Asia which nobody in the thirteen colonies could
have contemplated.

A Constitution has to work not only in the environment in which it was
drafted but also centuries later. It must therefore be capable of
adaptation to new conditions as they arise. Besides, Governments and
Parliaments are no longer allowed to play the passive role of keeping
the ring for competing interests; they have to take an active part in
social and economic development. Every constitutional provision relating
to an organization is a fetter upon its action, whether it prescribes
its membership or its procedure. The fact that such a fetter is
desirable now does not imply that it will be equally desirable a century
hence. The ideas upon which a Constitution is based in one generation
may be spurned as old-fashioned in the next. Nobody today would accept
the incredible inefficiency of the separation of powers as Madison
understood it.

The golden rule for constitution-makers, therefore, is never to put in
anything that can safely be left out. The fact that a provision is
thought to be desirable does not imply that it should be inserted in the
Constitution. It is easy enough to enact it by ordinary legislation. The
question to be asked is whether it is desirable to make the provision
binding upon succeeding generations. Nobody can answer that question
with assurance.

It will be seen that the problem has two aspects. If a Constitution can
be amended easily there is no great objection to inserting in it
provisions which may have to be amended. If it cannot be amended easily
it should be as short and as simple as possible. What the Constituent
Assembly has done is to produce a long and complicated document which
cannot easily be amended. It is quite obvious that there are clauses
which do not need to be constitutionally protected. An example taken at
random is article 224, which empowers a retired judge to sit in a High
Court. Is that a provision of such constitutional importance that it
needs to be constitutionally protected, and be incapable of amendment
except with the approval of two-thirds of the members of each House
sitting and voting in the Union Parliament?

The justification for the inclusion of large chunks of what would
otherwise be regulated by ordinary legislation is discussed in this and
the subsequent lectures, but it may be asked in general terms why the
Constituent Assembly did not set out with the idea of making the
Constitution as short and as simple as possible. The answer is to be
found, I think, in the constitutional history of India under British
rule. The Constitution derives directly from the Government of India
Act, 1935, from which in fact many of its provisions were copied almost
textually. That Act was the largest ever passed by the Parliament of the
United Kingdom, and its main purpose was to transfer power, subject to
numerous so-called safeguards, from British officials to Indian
politicians. It had therefore to create a new federal Legislature and at
the same time to reform provincial government and to establish new
relations with what were then called the States. The Government of India
had been an autocracy whose powers were at first limited in the interest
of British politicians and subsequently in the interest of Indian
politicians. The problem in 1935 was to redistribute the powers of
government along the lines approved by the Round Table Conference and
the Parliament of the United Kingdom. No distinction was drawn between
matters of a constitutional order and matters of a merely administrative
or judicial character. The Act of 1935 was an ordinary Act of the
Parliament of the United Kingdom, designed to amend that part of the law
of England which applied to British India. It could be amended, like a
Dogs Act, by a subsequent Act of the same Parliament. It was fundamental
law for British India, but it was also a part of the ordinary law of
Britain, that part of it which regulated the government of Britain's
Indian dependency.

The new Constitution has an entirely different character. It is
fundamental law which cannot be changed like the ordinary law. It was
therefore necessary for the Constituent Assembly to decide a question
which had never faced the Parliament of the United Kingdom, what rules
ought to be enacted as fundamental law and what ought to be enacted as
ordinary law. It seems that the Assembly did not seriously address
itself to that task. It asked itself a different question: What rules
are desirable in independent India ?

A second reason for making the Constitution inclusive rather than
exclusive arises from a characteristic which India shares with all other
countries, but which was of special importance in India. Inevitably
every Constitution 'dates'. The controversies of the immediate past
dominate thought; those of the future are as yet unknown. If we ask
ourselves what controversies dominated the minds of the Constituent
Assembly we shall find out why certain constitutional problems are dealt
with in detail, while others are barely mentioned.

1. India obtained independence after a long controversy between the
   leaders of Indian opinion[^indian-politicians] on the one side and the governmental
   authorities[^british-colonial-government] on the other. The leaders had been 'agin[^agin] the Government'
   for a generation. Many of them had suffered terms of imprisonment.
   Since the law had been an instrument of the governing power this
   experience might have led to a suspicion of all law, to the
   acceptance of anarchical theories, or at least to a belief that law
   was inconsistent with liberty. In fact, however, it led to the
   opposite conclusion, that the powers of government ought to be
   rigidly limited by law. Though the Governments already in being were
   responsible Governments, the experience of the Indian leaders had
   been with irresponsible Governments. The experience of Britain has
   been that public opinion keeps a responsible Government in check:
   but India has not shared that experience and therefore the
   Constituent Assembly, without making its theory articulate, assumed
   that government ought to be closely regulated by law.
2. The case for not granting independence to India was based mainly on
   the assertion that Indians were so divided by religion, race, caste
   and language that democratic government could not work. Indian
   opinion could not and did not accept that thesis. On the contrary it
   asserted that these elements of diversity had been grossly
   exaggerated, if not fomented, by the British rulers in order to keep
   themselves in power. Though there are provisions of the Constitution
   which recognize the existence of communal problems, they are neither
   numerous nor important. In the main it, so to speak, plays down
   communalism: and it is a remarkable fact that Ceylon, which for
   historical reasons suffered less from communalism than India did,
   has by its Constitution given greater recognition to communal
   problems. The official answer of the Indian National Congress to the
   communal argument was that it was simply a problem of fundamental
   liberties. Communalism is, or ought to be, irrelevant to politics;
   it is a cultural differentiation which will solve itself if the
   individual is given his freedom. Hence the solution to the problem
   is to limit the powers of government, not to enshrine communalism in
   the law.

   By 1946, too, Britain had accepted the Indian argument.
   Anxious to find a solution to the problem which would satisfy both
   Hindus and Muslims, the British Government had recourse, _inter alia_,
   to the doctrine of fundamental liberties. In the areas where Hindus
   were in a majority the Muslims would be protected by a Bill of
   Rights: in areas where the Muslims had a majority the Hindus would
   similarly be protected. The Constituent Assembly of 1946 therefore
   established a committee, and the machinery thus created continued
   under its own momentum into the Constituent Assembly of 1947.
3. One of the principal effects of British rule was to impose the
   western class system upon an eastern social system based mainly upon
   caste. If India had gradually adapted itself to the ways of the
   western world it is probable that the caste system would gradually
   have been modified. The imposition of western ideas, however,
   created a new social problem, a class division which was also a
   language division. I speak with some hesitation on this subject,
   because it is probably more important in Ceylon than in India and
   therefore I tend to exaggerate it. It has in any case been regarded
   more as a language problem than as a social problem. Mahatma Gandhi
   certainly regarded it as a social problem, but his remedy, the
   repudiation of industrialization, is economically impracticable and
   has been rejected by Indian opinion. It therefore appears in the
   Constitution as a language problem, the use of English by the
   wealthier classes. As such, it is exceedingly complex. On the one
   hand the English language has made the nationalist movement
   possible, and that political infant, the student politician, lisps
   the language of Burke and John Stuart Mill. On the other hand
   English is not only a badge of class but also a relic of British
   rule. Hence arose the need for the complex language provisions which
   would normally have been regulated by ordinary law and not by
   constitutional law.
4. Fundamentally, though, the class system is not a language problem
   but an economic problem. It is at least as acute in India as in
   eastern Europe, for India consists essentially of a vast village
   population, living in conditions of great penury, and a small urban
   middle class. It is not true that the Indian villager has nothing to
   lose but his chains. He can lose his land, and if he does he loses
   himself and his family. Nevertheless the class conflict of the West
   is present, and it is acute in the towns even if it is not very
   evident in the villages. Inevitably some Indian politicians have
   sought solutions in the collectivist ideas of the West. These ideas
   are of course in conflict with the individualist ideas which arose
   out of the nationalist movement. Essentially the Indian Constitution
   is an individualist document. Its prophets are Burke, Mill and
   Dicey: yet some at least of the members of the Constituent Assembly
   thought in collectivist terms. The result is a curious dichotomy. On
   the one hand the individualism of the nineteenth century has sought
   to limit the powers of government in the interest of liberty; on the
   other hand the collectivism of the twentieth century has sought to
   expand the powers of government in order that the State may regulate
   economic life and incidentally restrict liberty. In such conditions,
   compromise and complexity were inevitable.
5. One of the controversies of British India was the exercise of both
   administrative and judicial functions by the same officers. The
   validity of the distinction is at least arguable, and certainly it
   has not been possible to draw it in Britain. Though he is commonly
   credited with the honour, Montesquieu drew no such distinction. It
   is true enough that the concentration of power is dangerous to
   liberty, and Montesquieu said little more than that. Montesquieu of
   course had in mind the highly centralized administration of the
   French Empire, not the English Justice of the Peace, who is by no
   means a tyrant and whose functions show a nice confusion of
   administrative and judicial. In British India, though, the fear of
   tyranny existed locally, as well as in Calcutta or New Delhi. Owing
   to the vastness of India and the feebleness of its system of
   communications, the Collector was virtually a local dictator whose
   rule might be beneficent and on the other hand might not. In either
   case he secured little sympathy from the local Congress politicians.

[^indian-politicians]: Indian politicians who demanded independence from British colonial rule.

[^british-colonial-government]: Colonial government of British India.

[^agin]: against.

The doctrine of the separation of powers has therefore received a new
interpretation in India. It requires not merely the independence of the
superior courts, but also a differentiation of local functions. Judicial
administration, even at the lower levels, has become a subject of
constitutional importance. It seems that the complexity of the judicial
clauses of the Constitution is due to this theory, that judicial
administration is so important that it must be dealt with by
constitutional law and not merely by ordinary law.

In this connexion attention should be drawn to a characteristic of the
Constituent Assembly which is quite peculiar. Litigation is one of the
major industries of India. Also the legal profession has been one of the
easiest to enter. A medical practitioner has to walk the wards and learn
his job; an accountant has to serve an apprenticeship; a business man
has to learn his job in the office and the factory; a lawyer has merely
to join a Law College and pass examinations, and even where reading in
chambers has been compulsory there has been no real check on efficiency.
What is more, law is the only profession which may be easily combined
with politics. The Lawyer--Politician has therefore played a more
important part in Indian politics than in the politics of any country in
the world. As a lawyer, I cannot raise objections to this practice,
though it must be confessed that there is danger in it, for the
Lawyer--Politician is sometimes neither a good lawyer nor a good
politician. Whether the dominance of the Constituent Assembly by the
Lawyer--Politician has been good for India must be left for history to
say. What can at present be said is that it has added to the complexity
of the Constitution. It is noticeable, too, that the Constitution is
dominated by a view of constitutional law which most constitutional
lawyers now regard as outmoded, a view which derives from the works of
Albert Venn Dicey. He was one of the ablest constitutional lawyers which
England has produced, and a most persuasive writer because he knew how
to over-simplify. I doubt whether he is a good guide for the
constitution-maker in the twentieth century.

On the other hand there is also some evidence of the influence of the
new generation of constitutional lawyers, among whom I suppose I may be
counted. As a result of _Board of Education v. Rice_ (1911) and _Local
Government Board v. Arlidge_ (1915), Dicey himself began to doubt whether
his analysis, which was originally made in 1885, accorded with the
modern law. The post-war generation of students was taught that there
were qualifications and modifications to be made to Dicey's thesis. When
that generation reached sufficient maturity to express its own views, it
did more than add qualifications and exceptions. It began to study
fields of law which Dicey had neglected and to approach more nearly to
the continental concept of _administrative law_ (which Dicey had
misunderstood --- as Jèze pointed out). Taking that concept, it found
that --- contrary to Dicey's view --- there was an ever-growing volume of
administrative law. Like Dicey, it was interested in _contentieux
administratifs_; but, unlike Dicey, it was also interested in the
comparable rules of English law, which had grown up around the
_prerogative writs_. To suggest that the Indian lawyers had accepted this
new view of administrative law would be an exaggeration; but certainly
there was a new emphasis on the _prerogative writs_ which could not be
traced to Dicey. Though no English lawyer would have thought of putting
the _prerogative writs_ into a Constitution, the Constituent Assembly did
so. It is personally of interest to me to discover that some of those
who are making the most profit from this exaltation of the _prerogative
writs_ are my students.

These various factors have given India a most complicated Constitution.
Those of us who claim to be constitutional lawyers can look with
equanimity on this exaltation of our profession. But Constitutions are
intended to enable the process of government to work smoothly, and not
to provide fees for constitutional lawyers. The more numerous the briefs
the more difficult the process of government becomes. India has perhaps
placed too much faith in us.

One remarkable omission from the Constitution needs to be specially
studied, since it seems to illustrate the above analysis. The Government
of India Act, 1935, like its predecessors, assumed the strength of
communalism and therefore provided detailed rules for the distribution
of seats. The Indian National Congress repudiated all forms of communal
representation. Accordingly the new Constitution ignores the communal
problem except for the few temporary provisions for Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes, and Anglo--Indians contained in Part XVI. Adult suffrage
is provided for by article 326, and the size of a constituency is dealt
with by article 81; but the delimitation of constituencies is governed
by ordinary legislation in accordance with article 327. Now this is very
odd, because one would have thought this to be a function of the
greatest constitutional importance. Britain allows it to be regulated by
ordinary legislation, but Britain is almost unique in its trust in its
politicians.

In Britain the fundamental political division is between the working
classes and the salaried classes. Owing to the very considerable
industrial development, the middle class is very large and it holds the
balance of power. The prevailing wind being from the south-west, the
residential areas are in the west and the industrial areas in the east.
Consequently, if a small town has two constituencies, a division into
east and west will usually produce one Labour Member and one
Conservative. If, however, the division is into north and south, both
seats will be doubtful. As the pendulum swings, both constituencies will
be Labour; at the next election, both may be Conservative.

This simple example shows the political importance of delimitation. In
India there is not only the division caused by class (which is also a
division based upon English education and other western conventions);
there are also divisions caused by religion, race, caste and language.
Delimitation must thus be a most delicate task, with almost infinite
possibilities of abuse. Yet the Constituent Assembly chose to leave this
task to ordinary legislation passed by a simple majority, while a
retired High Court Judge cannot return to the Bench unless a provision
of the Constitution authorizes him.

Moreover, the effect of a system of single-member constituencies is
invariably to give a preference to the prevailing majority. In Britain
the representation of the successful majority is increased. In Asia
there is grave danger that voting will be on communal lines and
accordingly that communal minorities will be inadequately represented.
Ceylon guarded against this problem in its Constitution, while India
apparently believed it to be unimportant.


[^1]:
The argument that the British Constitution is rigid because much
legislation has remained unaltered for centuries will not hold
water. That legislation can be changed as easily as a Dogs Act. The
fact that British people are conservative in many matters,
especially those affecting the monarchy, is irrelevant. The
suggestion is not that the Indian Constitution ought to be changed
every morning, like underclothes in a Madras (or Colombo) climate,
but that it stops people from changing when they would like to
change.
