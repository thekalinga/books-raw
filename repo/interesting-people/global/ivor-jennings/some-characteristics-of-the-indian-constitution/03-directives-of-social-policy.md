# Directives of Social Policy

The idea of the Directive Principles of State Policy was taken from
_Éire_[^eire], which in turn took it from the Constitution of Republican Spain.
These preceding examples are significant: they came from countries whose
peoples are predominantly Roman Catholic, and the Roman Catholics are
provided by their Church not only with a faith but also with a
philosophy. This does not mean that the peoples were agreed on the
application of their philosophy. On the contrary, in Spain the
Republican Constitution was followed by civil war; in _Éire_ Mr de Valera
was accused of writing into the Constitution the policy of his own
party.

[^eire]: Éire is Irish for _Ireland_.

In substance, though, the idea of a statement of fundamental political
principles is older than the Spanish Republic. In a sense, the American
Declaration of Independence is such a document. It has been a source of
inspiration to citizens of the United States of America for nearly two
centuries. On the other hand, the 'self-evident' propositions with which
it begins are no longer self-evident. They are regarded as emanations
from a political doctrine which is no longer widely held. Again, the
Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen[^rights-of-man-and-citizen] annexed to the Constitution
of 1791, though not subsequently re-enacted, is regarded by French
lawyers as implicit in the popular sovereignty on which they found, and
indeed by which they legitimate, their successive Constitutions. The
influence of this Declaration has been even more profound than that of
the Americans, for it was a formulation of the principles which freed a
large part of Europe from tyranny.

[^rights-of-man-and-citizen]: The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, set by France's National Constituent Assembly in 1789, is a human civil rights document from the French Revolution.

One must beware of substituting English pragmatism for political
philosophy, for even pragmatism is a philosophy. Nevertheless, though
truth may be one and indivisible, the formulation of it varies from age
to age and even from person to person in the same age. The source of the
propositions in Part IV of the Indian Constitution is very obvious. The
ghosts of Sidney and Beatrice Webb stalk through the pages of the text.
Part IV of the Constitution expresses Fabian socialism without the
socialism, for only 'the nationalization of the means of production,
distribution and exchange' is missing: but nationalization for the Fabians
was a means to an end and not the end itself; the end is quite
adequately expressed in the Constitution. It is true that others besides
the Webbs have expressed some of these ideas. Articles 38 and 39 of the
Constitution seem to be based on article 45 of the Constitution of _Éire_,
which in turn comes from the Papal Bulls[^papal-bull]. Even so, the slight changes of
language are significant. The references to charity, private ownership,
free competition and the control of credit have been removed. The Papacy
has been insistent upon private enterprise; the Fabians regarded public
ownership as essential; the Indian Constitution leaves the question
open. The subsequent provisions are essentially Fabian except article
40, dealing with village _panchayats_, the references to the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in article 46, and the insistence upon
prohibition in article 47. In certain articles the emphasis is Indian,
but the substance is Fabian.

[^papal-bull]: A papal bull is a type of public decree, letters patent, or charter issued by a pope of the Catholic Church. It is named after the leaden seal that was traditionally appended to the end in order to authenticate it.

The line of thought which the Constitution has followed was created in
England during the course of the nineteenth century. It began with
Jeremy Bentham, was developed by the Radical Movement in and out of
Parliament and was taken over by the Liberal Party after 1867. It
dominated that party after the Liberal Unionists left in 1886, and most
of the propositions laid down by the Constitution would have been
accepted by the Liberal Government of 1906 to 1914. Meanwhile the Labour
Party had been formed, mainly under Fabian influence, and that party
took over the programme, with the addition of Fabian socialism, after 1918. The connexions between this movement and the Industrial Revolution
have been well brought out in Dicey's _Law and Opinion in England in the
Nineteenth Century_. Very likely the same ideas will be dominant in India
for the next generation. Notwithstanding the insistence of Mahatma
Gandhi on cottage industries and village crafts, it is plain that India
cannot feed its rapidly rising population, and still less raise the
appallingly low standard of living, unless there is rapid
industrialization.

It may be, therefore, that the ideas expressed in Part IV of the
Constitution will survive for a generation. Some of them may even
survive for a longer period, just as --- as I shall suggest
presently --- the ideas of the French Revolution and right-wing liberalism
have survived in Part III of the Constitution. On the other hand, the
question may be raised whether it is worth while to insert in a
Constitution a collection of political principles which obviously derive
from English experience in the nineteenth century and are deemed to be
suitable for India in the middle of the twentieth century. The question
whether they are suitable for the twenty-first century, when the
Constitution may still be in operation, cannot be answered; but it is
quite probable that they will be entirely outmoded. Experiments in the
use of atomic energy have reached an advanced stage and, if they
succeed, they will revolutionize the economic problem. If communism
survives into the next century, which in view of its origin in the early
period of English industrialization seems unlikely, India may be
communist and emphasize not the Benthamite and Fabian line of thought
but the Marxist and Leninist line. In any case the references to
international law may have become obsolete because there may be no
nations. In short, this Part of the Constitution is the product of time
and circumstance. Time moves on and circumstances change rapidly.

The answer that may be given is, no doubt, that this Part does not
matter. Article 37 tells us that the provisions contained in this Part
shall not be enforceable in any court. Some of them are obviously pious
aspirations. It may be doubted whether the State will, by 1961, provide
'free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the
age of fourteen years'. Probably nobody in the Constituent Assembly
wanted to provide free and compulsory education for infants in arms,
though they appear to be 'children' within the meaning of the
Constitution. Nor is there anything particularly significant about the
age of 14, save that most countries (following the example of Britain
until 1945) have fixed that age.

In any case, it is plain that this Part does matter. Article 37 also
asserts that the principles laid down in Part IV are 'fundamental in the
governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply
these principles in making laws'. This may be another pious aspiration,
but we are in the realm of politics in which piety, or at least the
appearance of piety, helps to capture votes. The so-called progressive
ideas of one generation are the so-called reactionary ideas of the next.
Most Constitutions, like most men and women, grow more respectable as
they grow older. They become part of 'our glorious heritage'. India,
like the United States, will have to revere the Constitution and the
flag because it has replaced a monarchy by an elected President, who
will usually be a retired party politician. The fact that a proposition
is in the Constitution will be a good argument against a different
proposition that is not in the Constitution. Possibly within a
generation some conservative politician will demand the Constitution,
the whole Constitution, and nothing but the Constitution. 'We do not
want to change the laws of England', said the conservative lords under
that reforming monarch, Henry II. India would not be copying the British
Constitution if they had been taken seriously. Some day, perhaps, the
die-hards will say 'We do not want to change the Constitution of India'.
