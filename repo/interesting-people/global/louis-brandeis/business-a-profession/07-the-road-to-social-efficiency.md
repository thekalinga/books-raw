# THE ROAD TO SOCIAL EFFICIENCY[^7/1]


[^7/1]: An address before the National Congress of Charities and Correction at Boston on June 8, 1911. Published in *The Outlook*, June 10, 1911.

Throughout the civilized world a developing sense of social
responsibility has compelled the community to support in some manner its
needy members, whatsoever the cause of their inability to support
themselves.

In granting this aid we are passing from sporadic, emotional charity to
organized charities, and from mere relief to preventive measures. We
have learned that financial dependence among the wage-earners is due, in
large part, to sickness, accident, invalidity, superannuation,
unemployment or to premature death of the breadwinner of the family.
Contingencies like these, referred to in the individual case as a
misfortune, are now recognized as ordinary incidents of the lives of the
wage-earners. And since our existing industrial system is converting an
ever-increasing percentage of the population into wage-earners, the need
of providing indemnity against financial losses from such ordinary
contingencies in the workingman\'s life has become apparent. So sickness
and death benefits and methods of compensation for accidents have been
resorted to. But this partial workingman\'s insurance has served mainly
in making clear the need of a comprehensive system which shall extend
protection also to the wage-earners in case of invalidity,
superannuation or unemployment, and to the widows and orphans left
helpless by the premature death of husband or father. In this movement
to establish a comprehensive system of workingmen\'s insurance, Germany,
France, and latterly England have already advanced far.

The United States must follow on the same path, for the conditions which
have led to the introduction of workingmen\'s insurance abroad are
universal in their operation. Besides, the form and aims of our
Government should lead us to action, as well as the sense of social
responsibility. American democracy rests upon the basis of the free
citizen. We accord (to the men) universal suffrage. We urge strenuously
upon every voter the duty of exercising this right. We insist that the
voter should exercise it in the interest of others as well as of
himself. We give thus to the citizen the rights of a free man. We impose
upon him a duty that can be intrusted with safety only to free men.
Politically, the American workingman is free --- so far as law can make
him so. But is he really free? Can any man be really free who is
constantly in danger of becoming dependent for mere subsistence upon
somebody and something else than his own exertion and conduct? Men are
not free while financially dependent upon the will of other individuals.
Financial dependence is consistent with freedom only where claim to
support rests upon right, and not upon favor.

President Cleveland\'s epigram that \"it is the duty of the citizen to
support the Government, not of the Government to support the citizen,\"
is only qualifiedly true. Universal suffrage necessarily imposes upon
the State the obligation of fitting its governors --- the voters --- for
their task; and the freedom of the individual is as much an essential
condition of successful democracy as his education. If the Government
permits conditions to exist which make large classes of citizens
financially dependent, the great evil of dependence should at least be
minimized by the State\'s assuming, or causing to be assumed by others,
in some form the burden incident to its own shortcomings.

The cost of attaining freedom is usually high; and the cost of providing
for the workingman, as an essential of freedom, a comprehensive and
adequate system of insurance will prove to be no exception to this
general rule. But, however large the cost, it should be fairly faced and
courageously met. For the expense of securing indemnity against the
financial losses attending accident, sickness, invalidity, premature
death, superannuation and unemployment should be recognized as a part of
the daily cost of living, like the more immediate demands for rent, for
food and for clothing. So far as it is a necessary charge, it should be
met now as a current expense, instead of being allowed to accumulate as
a debt with compound interest to plague us hereafter.

Few intelligent property owners omit to insure against fire. Everybody
recognizes the fire insurance premium as a current expense. And yet the
chance of loss by fire is very slight as compared with the chance of
loss of earnings by sickness, accident or premature death. Every
intelligent manufacturer makes in some form a regular charge for
depreciation of machinery and plant. And yet the depreciation of man
through invalidity and superannuation is no less certain, and frequently
more severe, than the depreciation of machinery. Every intelligent
manufacturer recognizes rent, interest and taxes as current daily
charges which continue although his plant is shut down or operates at
less than full capacity. The manufacturer makes allowance for this in
calculating the cost of production as an extra charge to be met from the
earnings of active days. But the cost to the employer of carrying an
unused plant is not as great relatively as the cost to the employee of
carrying himself and family while unemployed. The manufacturer who fails
to recognize fire insurance, depreciation, interest and taxes as current
charges of the business treads the path to bankruptcy. And that nation
does the like which fails to recognize and provide against the economic,
social and political conditions which impose upon the workingman so
large a degree of financial dependence.

What sum would be required annually to provide an adequate system of
workingmen\'s insurance cannot be determined from existing data. The
cost would obviously vary greatly in different occupations and in
different communities. An amount equal to 10% of current wages
would go far towards relieving in many industries the distress now
incident to sickness, accident, invalidity, premature death,
superannuation and unemployment of the wage-earner. But it is certain
that the proceeds of even so large a charge as 10% of the
average daily wage would, under present conditions, afford merely
alleviation of, and not indemnity for, the losses now attendant upon
those contingencies in the life of the workingman. The cost of providing
complete indemnity would probably reach an amount equal to 25% of the average daily wage. For the premiums requisite to secure
indemnity from losses incident to sickness, accident, invalidity,
premature death or superannuation would probably aggregate 15% of the daily wage; while the average percentage required to
indemnify for unemployment due to lack of work would probably rise above
10%.

This huge and apparently prohibitive expense should not, however, deter
us from taking action now. It should, on the contrary, incite us to
immediate and vigorous measures. Indeed, it has in it elements of great
encouragement. It will disclose how vast the waste incident to present
social and industrial conditions is. And when the extent of that waste
shall have been determined and made clear to our people, a long step
forward will have been taken on the road to improvement and resulting
social economy.

Some idea of the possibilities of improvement in this connection are
indicated by the following data.

Professor Irving Fisher has compared the mortality record of the
industrial life insurance companies, which provide life insurance to the
workingmen in amounts of less than \$500 on the weekly premium plan,
with the mortality in the ordinary life insurance companies, in which
the policies average \$1,000 or more. The figures of deaths per year for
each 1,000 persons insured are these:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Age                   | Industrial Life       | Ordinary Life         |
|                       | Insurance Mortality   | Insurance Mortality   |
|                       |                       |                       |
|                       | (Metropolitan Life    | (English Experience)  |
|                       | Experience)           |                       |
+=======================+======================:+======================:+
| 20                    | 10.5                  | 7.3                   |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| 25                    | 14.1                  | 7.8                   |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| 35                    | 17.2                  | 9.3                   |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| 55                    | 35.0                  | 21.7                  |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

The conditions under which that portion of our population live and work
who are insured in the ordinary life companies are far from ideal, and
leave open a great opportunity for reduction of the death rate. But here
we have an average death rate among the workingmen at their most
productive age --- twenty-five to thirty-five years --- which is nearly
twice as great as the death rate among those engaged in other
occupations. And this high death rate of the workingman is that of the
average insured workingman, not the death rate of those engaged in
extra-hazardous trades.

Can there be any doubt that, if this heavier mortality had to be
adequately compensated for by the State or the industries, and the
insurance cost paid from current earnings, its causes would be
adequately investigated and the evil conditions of living and working
which produce it would be remedied? Society and industry would find how
much cheaper it is to conserve than to destroy.

How near at hand the remedy for high mortality lies is illustrated by
the experience of the model factory village at Bourneville, near
Birmingham. While the average death rate for all ages in England and
Wales in the years 1902 to 1907 was 15.7, the death rate at Bourneville
was 6.3; and yet the occupations of the inhabitants of Bourneville were
fairly representative of the whole country. Over 50% of the
workers were factory hands; 36% were mechanics,
carpenters, bricklayers and others of unclassified occupations; and
about 13% clerks and travellers.

Professor Fisher concludes also that, on the average, every American is
sick thirteen days in the year.

Possibilities of lengthening lives and of avoiding sickness and
invalidity, like the possibilities of preventing accidents, will be
availed of when business as well as humanity demands that this be done.

William Hard quoted Edgar T. Davies, the Factory Inspector of Illinois,
as saying that in the year 1906 one hundred men were killed or crippled
in the factories of Illinois by the set-screw, and that for thirty-five
cents in each instance this danger device could have been recast into a
safety device. The set-screw stands up from the surface of the rapidly
revolving shaft, and as it turns catches dangerously hands and clothes.
For thirty-five cents the projecting top of the set-screw could be sunk
flush with the rest of the whirling surface of the shaft, and then no
sleeve could be entangled by it, and no human body could be swung and
thrown by it.

The South Metropolitan Gas Company, which established, in connection
with its system of compensation for accidents, a system of inquiry into
all accidents with a view to their prevention, reduced the number of
accidents per thousand in seven years from sixty-nine to forty.

John Calder, of Ilion, New York, tells of the reduction of accidents in
an American plant from a yearly average of two hundred to sixty-four.

Can there be any doubt that if every accident had to be carefully
investigated and adequately compensated for, the number of accidents
would be reduced to a half or a third?

And undoubtedly the paramount evil in the workingman\'s
life --- irregularity of employment --- would yield in large measure to like
treatment.

The New York Commission, in its recent report on unemployment, gives
data from the trades unions showing that \"organized workers lose, on
the average, 20% of their possible income through
unemployment,\" and data from the charitable societies showing that
\"from 25--35% of those who apply to them
for relief every year have been brought to their destitute condition
primarily through lack of work.\"

Some irregularity in employment is doubtless inevitable; but in the main
irregularity is remediable. It has been overcome with great profit to
both employer and employee in important businesses which have recognized
the problem as one seriously demanding solution. Society and industry
need only the necessary incentive to secure a great reduction in
irregularity of employment. In the scientifically managed business
irregularity tends to disappear. So far as it is irremediable it should
be compensated for like the inevitable accident.

The social and industrial engineers will find much of inspiration and
encouragement in the achievement of their fellow-engineers of the
factory mutual fire insurance companies of New England.

The huge fire waste in America is a matter of common knowledge. The loss
in 1910 was estimated at \$234,000,000; and yet there is one class of
property, in its nature peculiarly subject to fire risks, which was
practically immune. Some 2,600 factories and their contents, valued
together at about \$2,220,000,000, and scattered throughout twenty-four
States and the Dominion of Canada, suffered in the aggregate fire losses
of about one-fortieth of 1% of the value insured. The
factories so immune were those owned by members of the so-called
\"factory mutuals\" of New England. The cost to these factories for fire
insurance and fire prevention in the year 1910 was only forty-three
cents for each one thousand dollars of property insurance. Half a
century before, the cost of insurance to the New England factories was
\$4.30, or ten times as great. The record of the \"factory mutuals\" of
Rhode Island and of some other States is similar.

Now, how has this reduction of fire insurance cost been accomplished? It
was done by recognizing that the purpose of these so-called fire
insurance companies is not to pay losses but to prevent fires. These
mutual companies might more appropriately have been called Fire
Prevention Companies; for the losses paid represent merely instances of
failures in their main purpose. In these corporations the important
officials are not the financiers but the engineers --- men who rank among
the leaders in the engineering profession of America --- and aiding them
is a most efficient corps of inspectors.

The achievement of these factory mutuals --- the elimination of 90% of the fire risks --- is the result of sixty years of unremitting
effort in ascertaining and removing causes of fires, and incidentally
educating factory owners and their employees in the importance of
providing against these causes. The premiums paid represent the cost of
this advice, inspection and education as much as the cost of what is
ordinarily termed \" insurance.\"

The progress of the factory mutuals in reducing fire losses was
relatively slow; but it has been steady, as is shown in the following
table of net cost of fire insurance per \$1,000 per year in two
representative companies:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Possibilities no less alluring are open to the social and industrial
engineer. Will the community support their efforts?

Consider how great would be the incentive to humanize social and
industrial conditions if the cost of inhuman conditions were not only
made manifest, but had to be borne from day to day unless the inhuman
conditions themselves were removed!

Mere description of the misery unnecessarily entailed by the inhuman
conditions, mere statements of cost, however clear and forceful, will
fail to secure the removal of these inhuman conditions in industry and
in the life of our people from which this misery springs. But if society
and industry and the individual were made to pay from day to day the
actual cost of the sickness, accident, invalidity, premature death or
premature old age consequent upon excessive hours of labor, of
unhygienic conditions of work, of unnecessary risks, and of irregularity
in employment, those evils would be rapidly reduced.

We need a comprehensive system of workingmen\'s insurance as an
incentive to justice. We need it, \"lest we forget.\"
