# The Employer and Trades Unions[^3/1]


[^3/1]: An address delivered at the annual banquet of the Boston Typothetæ, April 21, 1904, for whom Mr. Brandeis had acted as counsel in a memorable struggle with the Typographical Union.

_Mr. Chairman and
Gentlemen_:---

I am glad to be with you. A reunion of veterans is enjoyable,
particularly so if the war has been successful --- properly so if the
right has triumphed, as in the recent struggle in which we were
engaged.

Let me review the
facts:---

Prior to February 1, 1901, the minimum wage of compositors in Boston
was \$15 per week. A three years\' agreement then entered into between
your association and the Boston Typographical Union No. 13 fixed the
minimum weekly wage at \$16 for the first year, and \$16.50 for the two
succeeding years. Shortly before February 1, 1904, the Union demanded
that the minimum wage be further increased to \$18. You offered an
increase to \$17 for the first year, and \$18 thereafter. The Union
rejected your offer, and ordered a general strike. On February 1, 1904,
the compositors went
out.

No principle of trade unionism was involved, nor the question of
increased wages for an indefinite period in the future. It was at most a
matter of \$1 a week for one year --- the equivalent of what would be lost
by each man in wages if the strike lasted just three weeks. To strike
for such a stake was shockingly bad business. It was followed quickly by
acts which also shocked the
conscience.

The United Typothetæ had made a four years\' contract with the
International Printing Pressmen and Assistants\' Union. This contract
provided for arbitration of grievances, provided expressly against
sympathetic strikes, and recognized expressly the open shop. In defiance
of this agreement and in the face of the protest of Martin P. Higgins,
the President of that Union, the Boston Typographical Union No. 13
undertook, by the promise of strike benefits, which in many cases
exceeded the wages the men were receiving, to induce pressmen and
feeders, who had no grievance whatever, to leave your employ. That was
morally wrong. We believed it to be also illegal. You applied to the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts for redress, and were accorded
the protection of an
injunction.

his was the beginning of the end; but the end itself came in a
manner even more desirable. After the strike had continued five weeks,
and the men had lost twice the paltry sum for which alone they struck,
Mr. Lynch, the President of the International Typographical Union, and
other members of its Executive Committee, came to Boston. They
investigated the facts. They doubtless realized the hopelessness of the
contest. They certainly realized the wrongfulness of inducing pressmen
and feeders who had no grievance to go out in defiance of their
contract. The strike was declared off --- unconditionally. No promise of
any kind was made to the compositors, pressmen and feeders who went out.
The open shop was formally declared in every office. Many of the men who
went out are still without work, and the strike benefits have ceased.
The dynasty which for years has governed the Boston Typographical Union
with unwisdom is tottering. The secretary has already resigned. The
president, it is said, will not seek
re-election.

So much for the past: what shall the future be? What should you
do to make it an era of peace and prosperity? The answer involves a
discussion of certain broad principles which, in my opinion, should
govern the relations of employer and employee in all branches of
industry, though in their application they would, like every rule, be
subject to exceptions more or less temporary, dependent upon the
peculiar facts of the individual
case.

*First.*Prolonged peace and prosperity can rest only upon the
foundation of industrial liberty. The peace which employers should seek
is not the peace of fifty years ago, when the employers were absolute
masters of the situation. The peace which the employees should seek is
not the peace of mediæval guilds, with their numberless restrictions.
Industrial liberty must attend political liberty. The lead which America
takes in the industrial world is no doubt due to our unbounded
resources; but of these resources none are so great as the spirit and
the ability incident to a free people. We lead the world industrially,
not so much because the resources of nature are unbounded, as because
the faculties and aspirations of men are comparatively unfettered. The
prosperity of New England --- this poor rich country --- is ample evidence
of this. We must have, therefore, for the development of our industries,
as for the development of our citizens, the highest degree of liberty
attainable. Industrial democracy should ultimately attend political
democracy. Industrial absolutism is not merely impossible in this
country at the present time, but is most undesirable. We must avoid
industrial despotism, even though it be benevolent despotism. Our
employers can no more afford to be absolute masters of their employees
than they can afford to submit to the mastery of their employees, than
the individual employees can afford to have their own abilities or
aspirations hampered by the limitations of their fellows. Some way must
be worked out by which employer and employee, each recognizing the
proper sphere of the other, will each be free to work for his own and
for the common good, and that the powers of the individual employee may
be developed to the utmost. To attain that end, it is essential that
neither should feel that he stands in the power --- at the mercy --- of the
other. The sense of unrestricted power is just as demoralizing for the
employer as it is for the employee. Neither our intelligence nor our
characters can long stand the strain of unrestricted power. Every
business requires for its continued health
the*memento
mori*of competition from without. It
requires, likewise, a certain competition within, which can exist only
where the ownership and management on one hand, and the employees on the
other, shall each be alert, hopeful, self-respecting, and free to work
out for themselves the best conceivable
conditions.

*Second.*The right of labor to organize is recognized by law,
and should be fully recognized by employers. There will be in most
trades little probability of attaining the best conceivable conditions
unless in some form a union of the employees exists. It is no answer to
this proposition to point to instances of trade-union excesses and of
the disasters which attended them. We believe in democracy despite the
excesses of the French Revolution. Nor are claims of the trades unions
disproved by pointing to the instances where the best results have been
attained in businesses in which no trace of unionism existed. Wise,
far-seeing employers act upon the spirit or the hint of union demands
instead of waiting to have them enforced. \"A word to the wise is
sufficient.\" The steps in advance have been taken often for the express
purpose of preventing trades-unionism from finding a lodgment, often,
unconsciously, as a result merely of the enlightenment which comes with
the necessary thinking that trade-union agitation compels. Such
successful businesses are, indeed, the greatest triumphs of unionism;
and their marked success is due in large part to the fact that they have
had all the advantages of unionism without having to bear the
disadvantages which, in their imperfect state, attend the unions. We
must not forget the merits of unionism in our righteous indignation
against certain abuses of particular
unionists.

Most people admit the immense service which the labor unions
have rendered to the community during the last twenty-five years in
raising of wages, shortening of the hours of labor, bettering of
conditions under which labor is performed, and protecting women and
children from excessive or ill-timed work; but the services which the
labor unions can render in the future are even greater than they have
rendered in the past. The employer needs the unions \"to stay him from
the fall of vanity\"; the employees need them for their own protection;
the community needs them to raise the level of the
citizen.

Strong, stable trades unions can best serve these ends. The
leaders of strong unions only will adequately feel the terrible
responsibility resting upon them. The leaders of stable unions only can
get the experience essential to an adequate performance of their duties;
and experience almost invariably makes the leaders reasonable and
conservative. Only long service as a labor leader can give that
knowledge of the employer\'s side of the controversy which is essential
to its just and proper settlement. Peace and prosperity, therefore, are
not to be attained by any attempt to weaken trades unions. Our hope lies
rather in their growing strength and
stability.

At all events, the employer, whether he wills it or not,
has in most trades to reckon with the union. What shall his attitude
be?

*Third.*Employees are entitled to be represented by union
officers. A short time ago it was common for an employer not to
\"recognize the union.\" That is, although he knew a large number of his
employees were members of the union, he refused to negotiate in matters
relating to the employees with its officers, on the theory that the
employer should deal directly and only with his employees, and may not
brook the interference of an outsider. This plausible but unsound theory
has yielded generally to facts and to reason. One hears little now of
employers arbitrarily refusing to deal with the chosen representatives
of union employees. But, of course, recognizing that union officers are
the proper representatives of the employees in any matter requiring
consideration by the employer does not mean yielding to union demands,
any more than recognizing a customer means conceding his
demands.

How, then, shall the employer deal with the union\'s
representative when a demand is made to which he feels he cannot accede,
or when a controversy has already arisen? Many are ready with the
answer: Arbitration; others again say: Conciliation. Arbitration and
conciliation are each at times wise, but each involves the intercession
of third parties. In arbitration it is the referee; in conciliation, the
common friend. Ordinarily, neither is
needed.

*Fourth.*Employers and employees should try to agree. A
very able man, who taught the law of partnership at Harvard, once asked
the class, \"What shall be done if a controversy arises between
partners?\" The students suggested one legal remedy after another, --- a
receiver, an injunction, a dissolution. \"No,\" said he, \"they should
try to agree.\" In the most important sense, employer and employee are
also partners. They, too, should try to agree; and the attempt made in a
properly conducted conference will generally be
successful.

Nine-tenths of the serious controversies which arise in
life result from misunderstanding, result from one man not knowing the
facts which to the other man seem important, or otherwise failing to
appreciate his point of view. A properly conducted conference involves a
frank disclosure of such facts --- patient, careful argument, willingness
to listen and to
consider.

Bluff and bluster have no place there. The spirit must
be, \"Come, let us reason together.\" Such a conference is impossible
where the employer clings to the archaic belief commonly expressed in
the words, \"This is my business, and I will run it as I please.\" It is
impossible where the labor representative, swaggering in his power to
inflict injury by strike and boycott, is seeking an unfair advantage of
the employers, or would seek to maintain even a proper position by
improper means. Such conferences will succeed only if employer and
employee recognize that, even if there be no so-called system of
profit-sharing, they are in a most important sense partners, and that
each is entitled to a patient hearing, with a mind as open as the
prejudice of self-interest
permits.

The potent force of right reasoning in such
conferences can hardly be overestimated. If applied with tact and in the
aid of right action, it is almost irresistible. But it must be used only
in the right spirit and in the aid of right
action.

*Fifth.*It is necessary that the owners or the real
managers of the business should themselves participate in the
conferences, partly because the labor problem requires the best thought
available and the most delicate treatment, and partly because the
employees feel better satisfied and are apt to receive better treatment
when they are dealing with the ultimate authority and not with an
intermediary. Such conferences are necessarily time-consuming, but the
time cannot be better spent. They are as instructive to the employer as
to the employees. We must remember that there are no short cuts in
evolution.

The greatest obstacle to the success of such
conferences is the suspicion of the labor representatives --- a suspicion
due partly to ignorance of the employer\'s actual attitude, partly to
knowledge of individual acts of unfairness of other employers, and
partly also to a belief, which is frequently erroneous, that the
employer will get some advantage through his supposed superior skill and
ability. Suspicion yields only to experience; and for this reason, among
others, the conferences are most successful when participated in by
labor leaders of long standing. The more experienced the representative,
the
better.

But conferences, though wisely conducted and with
the best of intentions on either side, do not always result in
agreement. Men fail at times to see the right; and, indeed, what is
right is often in doubt. For such cases arbitration affords frequently
an appropriate remedy. This remedy deserves to take its place among the
honorable means of settling those questions to which it properly
applies. Questions arise however, which may not be arbitrated.
Differences are sometimes fundamental. Demands may be made which the
employer, after the fullest consideration, believes would, if yielded
to, destroy the business. Such differences cannot be submitted to the
decision of others. Again, the action of the union may appear to have
been lawless or arbitrary, a substitution of force for law or for
reason.

What, then, should be the attitude of the
employer?

*Sixth.*Lawless or arbitrary claims of organized
labor should be resisted at whatever cost. I have said that it is
essential in dealing with these problems that the employer should strive
only for the right. It is equally as important that he should suffer no
wrong to be done unto him. The history of Anglo-Saxon and of American
liberty rests upon that struggle to resist wrong --- to resist it at any
cost when first offered rather than to pay the penalty of ignominious
surrender. It is the old story of the \"ship money,\" of \"the writs of
assistance,\" and of \"taxation without representation.\" The struggle
for industrial liberty must follow the same
lines.

If labor unions are arbitrary or lawless, it is
largely because employers have ignominiously submitted to arbitrariness
or lawlessness as a temporizing policy or under a mistaken belief as to
their own immediate interests. You hear complaint, too, of lawless
strikers in the legislature and in the city council; but, if lawlessness
and corruption exist there, it is largely because the great corporations
and moneyed interests have forgotten the good old maxim, \"Not one cent
for tribute, but millions for
defence.\"

The world was aghast last summer at the
disclosure of Sam Parks\'s corruption. The desecration of Labor Day by
his glorification, after he had been sentenced to Sing Sing, was
shocking to every sense of decency. This false loyalty of the unionists
very properly alienated from trades unions much of the public favor
which John Mitchell had gained for them. But, after all, Sam Parks\'s
corruption and the terrible losses and suffering which attended the
prolonged strike were largely the fruit of the employers\' wrong-doing.
Who bribed Sam Parks? The rich contractors, --- pre-eminently the huge
corporations on whose boards of directors sat many of the leading
financiers of the country. They corrupted Sam Parks or fed his
corruption, corrupted him either to get an undue advantage over their
employees or over their competitors, or as a seemingly inexpensive way
of meeting what they deemed to be unreasonable and extortionate demands.
At last employers, employees, and a large part of the community paid the
penalty. Fortunately, the world is so ordered that we must pay the
penalty for our sins, be they sins of commission or omission, of doing
wrong or of suffering wrong to be done unto
us.

You may compromise a matter of wages, you may
compromise a matter of hours --- if the margin of profit will permit. No
man can say with certainty that his opinion is the right one on such a
question. But you may not compromise on a question of morals, or where
there is lawlessness or even arbitrariness. Industrial liberty, like
civil liberty, must rest upon the solid foundation of law. Disregard the
law in either, however good your motives, and you have anarchy. The plea
of trades unions for immunity, be it from injunction or from liability
for damages, is as fallacious as the plea of the lynchers. If lawless
methods are pursued by trades unions, whether it be by violence, by
intimidation, or by the more peaceful infringement of legal rights, that
lawlessness must be put down at once and at any
cost.

Likewise industrial liberty must rest upon
reasonableness. We gain nothing by exchanging the tyranny of capital for
the tyranny of labor. Arbitrary demands must be met by determined
refusals, also at any
cost.

In our international relations we are told
that the best assurance of peace lies in preparedness for war. This is
equally true in the industrial world. The union has its strike fund. The
employer must also pay in some form the premium for insuring an
honorable peace. He has adopted long since the guaranty fund for his
credits, the depreciation fund for his machinery. He should now adopt
another reserve fund to guard him against the losses attendant upon
strikes, and, above all, should so organize his business as to be less
vulnerable to them. Known weakness invites arbitrary attack, as
opportunity makes the
thief.

These are the principles by which alone
the labor problem can be satisfactorily solved. They are broad, indeed;
for they are the eternal principles of LIBERTY, FRATERNITY, JUSTICE,
HONOR.
