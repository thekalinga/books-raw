"The house of bishops would be as much
at sea in Minneapolis as at Atlantic City." This bit of
delicious humor, all too rare in America's solemn assemblies,
sparkled at a tense moment in the late conference
of the Episcopalian magnates at Denver when the
respective merits of the two cities as future meeting
places were under debate. But the real cause of the
caustic comment seems to have been a heated discussion,
led by the Honorable George W. Wickersham, over
a dangerous proposal to modify, not the Volstead act,
but the sacred creed of rugged American individualism.

That contest had been precipitated by the report of
a special commission in which occurred these highly inflammatory
words: "It is becoming increasingly evident
that the conception of society as made up of autonomous,
independent individuals is as faulty from the point
of view of economic realism as it is from the standpoint
of Christian idealism. Our fundamental philosophy of
_rugged individualism_ must be modified to meet the needs
of a co-operative age." This frightful conclusion flowed
from a fact statement which the commission summarized
in the following language: "Side by side with such
misery and idleness, there are warehouses bursting with
goods which cannot be bought; elevators full of wheat
while bread lines haunt our cities; carefully protected
machinery lying idle, while jobless men throng our
streets; money in the banks available at low rates."

These shocking passages Mr. Wickersham read to
the assembled delegates with considerable indignation,
and denied their truth. Then he added an illuminating
exposition all his own: "I think this is an expression
of a social philosophy that is expressed by the Soviet
Government of Russia. It is a negation of the whole
concept of American civilization. I think it would be a
sad day when the American people abandon the principles
on which they have grown to greatness." Coming
to specifications, he particularly attacked a point in
the report, that "compulsory unemployment insurance
is feasible." Realizing that Mr. Wickersham was a specialist
in individualism, since he was the chief author of
a collective report from which each individual signer
apparently dissented, the congregated deputies at Denver
voted down the proposal that the commission's
statement should be taken as "representing the mind
of the Church," and substituted a mere pious recommendation
that it should be given "careful consideration"
by members of the Church. Such, at least, is the
story reported in the press.

This is only one of many straws in the wind indicating
a movement to exalt _rugged individualism_ into a national
taboo beyond the reach of inquiring minds. From
day to day it becomes increasingly evident that some of
our economic leaders (by no means all of them) are
using the phrase as an excuse for avoiding responsibility,
for laying the present depression on "Government interference,"
and for seeking to escape from certain
forms of taxation and regulation which they do not
find to their interest. If a smoke screen big enough can
be laid on the land, our commercial prestidigitators[^prestidigitator]
may work wonders --- for themselves.

[^prestidigitator]: One who performs feats of prestidigitation; a sleight-of-hand artist.

Still more direct evidence confirms this view. For example,
in the autumn of 1930, a New York bank published,
as a kind of revelation from on high, a slashing
attack on "Government interference with business,"
written by that stanch English Whig, Macaulay, a
hundred years ago; and a few weeks later one of the
leading advertising firms took a whole page in the _New
York Times_ to blazon forth the creed anew under the
captivating head: "Cheer Up! Our Best Times Are Still
Ahead of Us" And the whole gospel was summed up
in these words from Macaulay: "Our rulers will best
promote the improvement of the people by strictly confining
themselves to their own legitimate duties --- by
leaving capital to find its most lucrative course, commodities
their fair price, industry and intelligence their
natural reward, idleness and folly their natural punishment
--- by maintaining peace, by defending property,
by diminishing the price of law, and by observing strict
economy in every department of the State. Let the
Government do this --- the people will assuredly do the
rest." In other words, here was put forth in the name
of American business, with all the pontifical assurance
that characterized Macaulay's shallowest sophistry,
the pure creed of historic individualism, and here was
served on the Government and people of the United
States a warning revelation of confident expectations.

A year later, in a release to the press, Mr. Otto Kahn
discussed the subject of planning and intimated that
the fortunate position of France to-day is to be ascribed
to the fact that the French Government interferes less
with business than does the Government of Germany or
Great Britain, with the implication that the United
States might profit from this experience. About the
same time the Honorable Newton D. Baker made a long
address at Williamstown which was evidently designed
to show that nothing important could be done in the
present crisis by the Federal Government, except perhaps
in the way of tariff reduction by international
agreement. And now comes from Chicago the announcement
that a number of rugged business men are forming
a national association to combat Government in
business, to break up this unholy alliance. There is not
a professional lunching-and-dining fellowship in America
that is not now applauding to the echo such ringing
cries as "Let Us Alone," "Take Government Out of
Business," "Hands Off," "Unburden Capital." With an
eye on such straws in the wind, President Hoover publicly
states that all notions about planned economy
come out of Russia, thus placing such distinguished
men as Gerard Swope and Owen D. Young under the
horrible Red ban. As one of the high-powered utility
propagandists recently explained, the best way to discredit
an opponent is to pin a Red tag on him --- without
reference to his deserts, of course.

# II

Hence it is important to ask, calmly and without
reference to election heats, just what all this means.
In what way is the Government "in business" and how
did it get there? Here we climb down out of the muggy
atmosphere of controversy and face a few stubborn
facts. They are entered in the indubitable records of
the Government of the United States and are as evident
as the hills to them that have eyes to see. Let us
catalogue a few of them _seriatim_[^seriatim] for the first time in
the history of this adventure in logomachy[^logomachy].

[^seriatim]: One after another, in order; taking one topic or subject at a time in an order; sequentially. In order, step by step.

[^logomachy]: Dispute over the meaning of words.

1. **Government Regulation of Railways, from 1887
   to the last Act of Congress.** How did the Government
   get into this business? The general cause was the conduct of railway corporations under the rule of _rugged
   individualism_ --- rebates, pools, stock watering, bankruptcy-juggling, all the traffic will bear, savage rate
   slashing, merciless competition, and the rest of it. If
   any one wants to know the facts, let him read the history of railroading in the sixties, seventies, and early
   eighties, or, if time is limited, the charming illustrations presented in Charles Francis Adams' "A Chapter
   of Erie." And what was the immediate cause of the
   Government's intervention? The insistence of business
   men, that is, shippers, who were harassed and sometimes ruined by railway tactics, and of farmers, the
   most rugged of all the rugged individualists the broad
   land of America has produced. And the result? Let the
   gentle reader compare the disastrous railway bankruptcies that flowed from the panic of 1873, including
   bloodshed and arson, with the plight of railways now,
   bad as it is. Government regulation is not a utopian
   success, but it is doubtful whether any of our great
   business men would like to get the Government entirely
   out of this business and return to the magnificent
   anarchy of Jay Gould's age. President Hoover has not
   even suggested it.
2. **Waterways**. Since its foundation the Government
   has poured hundreds of millions into rivers, harbors,
   canals, and other internal improvements. It is still
   pouring in millions. Some of our best economists have
   denounced it as wasteful and have demonstrated that
   most of it does not pay in any sense of the word. But
   President Hoover, instead of leaving this work to private enterprise, insists on projecting and executing the
   most elaborate undertakings, in spite of the fact that
   some of them are unfair if not ruinous to railways. Who
   is back of all this? Business men and farmers who want
   freight rates. There is not a chamber of commerce
   on any Buck Creek in America that will not cheer until
   tonsils are cracked any proposal to make the said creek
   navigable. Dredging companies want the good work to
   go on, and so do the concerns that make dredging machinery. Farmers are for it also and they are, as already said, the ruggedest of rugged individuals --- so
   rugged in fact that the vigorous efforts of the Farm
   Board to instill co-operative reason into them have been
   almost as water on a duck's back.
   lower
3. **The United States Barge Corporation**. Who got
   the Government into the job of running barges on some
   of its improved waterways? Certainly not the Socialists, but good Republicans and Democrats speaking for
   the gentlemen listed under 2 above.
4. **The Shipping Business**. The World War was the
   occasion, but not the cause of this departure. For more
   than half a century the politicians of America fought
   ship subsidies against business men engaged in the shipbuilding and allied industries. At last, under the cover
   of war necessities, the Government went into the shipping business, with cheers from business. Who is back
   of the huge expenditures for the merchant marine?
   Business men. Who supports huge subsidies under the
   guise of "lucrative mail contracts," making a deficit in
   postal finances to be used as proof that the Government cannot run any business? Business men clamor for
   these mail subsidies and receive them. Who put the
   Government into the business of providing cheap money
   for ship building? Business men did it. Those who are
   curious to know how these things were done may profitably read the sworn testimony presented during the
   investigation of W. B. Shearer's patriotic labors on
   behalf of the ship-building interests, especially the exhibits showing how money was spent like water "educating" politicians. Who wants navy officers on half
   pay to serve on privately owned ships? Business men.
   Who wants the Government to keep on operating ships
   on "pioneer" lines that do not pay? Business men. And
   when the United States Senate gets around to investigating this branch of business, it will find more entertainment than the Trade Commission has found in the
   utility inquest.
5. **Aviation**. The Government is "in" this business. It
   provides costly airway services free of charge and subsidizes air mail. Who is behind this form of Government enterprise? Gentlemen engaged in aviation and the
   manufacture of planes and dirigibles. Then the Government helps by buying planes for national defense. Who
   is opposed to air mail subsidies? A few despised "politicians."
6. **Canals**. Who zealously supported the construction
   of the Panama Canal? Shippers on the Pacific Coast who
   did not like the railway rates. Also certain important
   shipping interests on both coasts --- all controlled by
   business men. Who insisted that the Government should
   buy the Cape Cod Canal? The business men who put
   their money into the enterprise and found that it did
   not pay. Then they rejoiced to see the burden placed
   on the broad back of our dear Uncle Sam.
7. **Highway Building**. Who has supported Federal
   highway aid --- the expenditures of hundreds of millions
   on roads, involving the taxation of railways to pay for
   ruinous competition? Everybody apparently, but specifically business men engaged in the manufacture and
   sale of automobiles and trucks. Who proposes to cut
   off every cent of that outlay? Echoes do not answer.
8. **The Department of Commerce, its magnificent
   mansion near the Treasury Department, and its army
   of hustlers scouting for business at the uttermost ends
   of the earth**. Who is responsible for loading on the
   Government the job of big drummer at large for business? Why shouldn't these rugged individualists do
   their own drumming instead of asking the taxpayers to
   do it for them? Business men have been behind this
   enormous expansion, and Mr. Hoover, as Secretary of
   Commerce, outdid every predecessor in the range of his
   activities and the expenditure of public money. Who
   proposes to take the Government out of the business of
   hunting business for men who ought to know their own
   business?
9. **The Big Pork Barrel** --- appropriations for public
   buildings, navy yards, and army posts. An interesting
   enterprise for the United States Chamber of Commerce
   would be to discover a single piece of pork in a hundred
   years that has not been approved by local business men
   as beneficiaries. When Ben Tillman shouted in the
   Senate that he intended to steal a hog every time a
   Yankee got a ham, he knew for whom the speaking was
   done.
10. **The Bureau of Standards.** Besides its general
    services, it renders valuable aid to business undertakings. Why shouldn't they do their own investigating at
    their own expense, instead of turning to the Government?
11. **The Federal Trade Commission.** Who runs there
    for rulings on "fair practices"? Weary consumers?
    Not often. Principally, business men who do not like
    to be outwitted or cheated by their competitors. If we
    are rugged individualists, why not let every individualist
    do as he pleases, without invoking Government intervention at public expense?
12. **The Anti-Trust Acts**. Business men are complaining against these laws on the ground that they cannot
    do any large-scale planning without incurring the risk
    of prosecution. The contention is sound, but who put
    these laws on the books and on what theory were they
    based? They were the product of a clamor on the part
    of farmers and business men against the practices of
    great corporations. Farmers wanted lower prices. Business men of the smaller variety objected to being
    undersold, beaten by clever tricks, or crushed to the
    wall by competitors with immense capital. And what
    was the philosophy behind the Sherman Act and the
    Clayton Act? Individualism, pure and undefiled. "The
    New Freedom" as President Wilson phrased it in literary language. "Break up the trusts and let each tub
    stand on its own bottom." That was the cry among
    little business men. As lawyers put it in their somber
    way, "the natural person's liberty should not be destroyed by artificial persons known as corporations created under the auspices of the State." Whether any
    particular business man is for or against the anti-trust
    laws depends upon his particular business and the state
    of its earnings.
13. **The Tariff**. On this tender subject it is scarcely
    possible to speak soberly. It seems safe to say, however,
    that if all the business men who demand this kind of
    "interference" --- with the right of capital to find its
    most lucrative course, industry and intelligence their
    natural reward, commodities their fair price, and idleness and folly their natural punishment --- were to withdraw their support for protection, cease their insistence
    on it, then the politicians would probably reduce the
    levy or go over to free trade; with what effect on business no one can correctly predict. At all events there
    are thousands of business men who want to keep the
    Government in the business of protecting their business
    against foreign competition. If competition is good,
    why not stand up and take it?
14. **The Federal Farm Board**. This collectivist institution is the product of agrarian agitation, on the
    part of our most stalwart individualists, the free and
    independent farmers; but President Hoover sponsored
    it and signed the bill that created it. Now what is its
    avowed purpose as demonstrated by the language of
    the statute, the publications of the Farm Board, and
    the activities carried out under its auspices? It is primarily and fundamentally intended to stabilize prices.
    and production through co-operative methods. And
    what has the Board done? It has encouraged the development of co-operation as distinguished from individualism among farmers; it has financed co-operative
    associations; it has denounced individualistic farmers
    who insist on growing as much as they please, and has
    tried to get them to increase their earnings by a common limitation of production. If the Agricultural Marketing Act means anything, if the procedure of the
    Farm Board is not a delusion, then co-operation is to
    be substituted for individualism in agricultural production and marketing. If there is ever to be a rational
    adjustment of supply to demand in this field, the spirit
    and letter of President Hoover's measure must be
    realized through organized action by millions of farmers under Federal auspices. The other alternative is
    simon-pure individualism: let each farmer produce what
    he likes, as much of it as he likes, and sell it at any
    price he can get. But under the happy title "Grow Less
    --- Get More," the Farm Board has given instructions
    to farmers: "One thing the successful manufacturers
    learned long ago was that they could not make money
    when they produced more than they could sell at a
    profit." The obvious moral is for farmers to get together under Government leadership or hang separately.
15. **The Moratorium and Frozen Assets**. The latest
    form of Government interferences with "the natural
    course" of economy is the suspension of payments due
    the United States from foreign powers on account of
    lawful debts and the proposal to give public support to
    "frozen assets." What was the source of inspiration
    here? American investment bankers having got themselves into a jam in their efforts to make easy money
    now demand Government assistance. In 1927 one of the
    most distinguished German economists told the writer
    of this article that the great game in his country, as
    in other parts of Europe, was to borrow billions from
    private bankers in the United States, so that it would
    ultimately be impossible to pay reparations, the debts
    due the Federal Government, _and_ then the debts owed
    to private parties. The expected result? American bankers would then force their Government to forego its
    claims for the benefit of private operators who wanted
    to make bankers' commissions and eight or ten % on their money. Well, the game worked. American
    taxpayers are to be soaked and American bankers are
    to collect --- perhaps.

And what is a "frozen asset"? It is a gaudy name
for a piece of paper representing a transaction in which
the holder expected to get a larger return than was
possible on a prudent, rock-bottom investment. A Hartford,
Connecticut, municipal four is not frozen; a
holder can get better than par in the present dark hour
of Wall Street's sorrows. A seven % Western
farm mortgage is frozen tight --- and ought to be, and
the holder frozen with it. So is a Bolivian seven. Why
should there be Federal interference to save investors
from reaping the fruits of their folly and greed? No
reason, except that the latter want the Government
to bring home their cake so that they can eat it. The
trouble is that American capital, in finding "its most
lucrative course," has fallen into a slough, and if it
gets out with its gains intact the Government must
bring a derrick to hoist it.

# III

In this survey of a few leading economic activities
of the Federal Government the emphasis is not critical;
so far as the present argument is concerned, any or all
of these functions may be justified with respect to national
interest. Indeed it is difficult to find any undertaking
of the Government which is not supported by
some business men on the ground of national defense.
In the early days of our history even those statesmen
who generally espoused free trade or low tariffs were
willing to concede the importance of making the nation
independent in the manufacture of munitions of war.
And in the latest hour, subsidies to the merchant marine,
to aviation, and to waterways development are
stoutly defended in the name of preparedness. Transforming
a creek into a river navigable by outboard
motor boats can be supported by military engineers on
the theory that it gives them practice in their art. No;
the emphasis here is not critical. The point is that the
Federal Government does not operate in a vacuum, but
under impulsion from without; and all of the measures
which put the Government into business have been supported
by rugged individualists --- business men or farmers
or both. The current tendency to describe the Government
as a meddling busybody, prying around and
regulating for the mere pleasure of taking the joy out
of somebody's life, betrays an ignorance of the facts
in the case. The Government of the United States operates
continually in the midst of the most powerful assembly
of lobbyists the world has ever seen --- the representatives
of every business interest that has risen above
the level of a corner grocery; and there is not a single
form of Government interference with business that
does not have the approval of one or more of these
interests --- except perhaps the taxation of incomes for
the purpose, among other things, of paying the expenses
of subsidizing and regulating business.

For forty years or more there has not been a President,
Republican or Democratic, who has not talked
against Government interference and then supported
measures adding more interference to the huge collection
already accumulated. Take, for instance, President
Wilson. He made his campaign in 1912 on the classical
doctrine of individualism; he blew mighty blasts in the
name of his new freedom against the control of the
Government by corporate wealth and promised to separate
business and Government, thus setting little fellows
free to make money out of little business. The
heir of the Jeffersonian tradition, he decried paternalism
of every kind. Yet look at the statutes enacted
under his benign administration: the trainmen's law
virtually fixing wages on interstate railways for certain
classes of employees; the shipping board law; the Farm
Loan Act; Federal aid for highway construction; the
Alaskan railway; the Federal Reserve Act; the Water
Power Act; and all the rest of the bills passed during
his régime. Only the Clayton anti-trust law can be
called individualistic. No wonder Mr. E. L. Doheny exclaimed
to Mr. C. W. Barron that President Wilson
was a college professor gone Bolshevist! And why did
Democrats who had been saying "the less government
the better" operate on the theory that the more government
the better? Simply because their mouths were
worked by ancient memories and their actions were
shaped by inexorable realities.

Then the Republicans came along in 1921 and informed
the country that they were going back to normalcy,
were determined to take the Government out of
business. Well, did they repeal a single one of the important
measures enacted during the eight years of
President Wilson's rule? It would be entertaining to see
the sanhedrim of the United States Chamber of Commerce
trying to make out a list of laws repealed in the
name of normalcy and still more entertaining to watch
that august body compiling a list of additional laws
interfering with "the natural course of business" enacted
since 1921. Heirs of the Hamiltonian tradition,
the Republicans were not entitled to talk about separating
the Government from business. Their great spiritual
teacher, Daniel Webster, a pupil of Hamilton,
had spoken truly when he said that one of the great
reasons for framing the Constitution was the creation
of a government that could regulate commerce. They
came honestly by subsidies, bounties, internal improvements,
tariffs, and other aids to business. What was
the trouble with them in the age of normalcy? Nothing;
they just wanted their kind of Government intervention
in the "natural course of industry." Evidently, then,
there is some confusion on this subject of individualism,
and it ought to be examined dispassionately in the light
of its history with a view to discovering its significance
and its limitations; for there is moral danger in saying

# IV

Historically speaking, there are two schools of individualism:
one American, associated with the name of
Jefferson, and the other English, associated with the
name of Cobden. The former was agrarian in interest,
the latter capitalistic. Jefferson wanted America to be a
land of free, upstanding farmers with just enough
government to keep order among them; his creed was
an agrarian creed nicely fitted to a civilization of sailing
ships, ox carts, stagecoaches, wooden plows, tallow
dips, and home-made bacon and sausages; and since
most of the people in the United States, during the
first century of their independence, were engaged in
agriculture, they thought highly of Jefferson's praise
of agriculture and his doctrine of anarchy plus the
police constable. Cobden's individualism was adapted to
capitalist England at the middle of the nineteenth century
--- early industrial England. At that moment his
country was the workshop of the world, was mistress
of the world market in manufactured commodities, and
feared no competition from any foreign country. English
capitalists thus needed no protective tariffs and
subsidies and, therefore, wanted none. Hence they exalted
free trade to the level of a Mosaic law, fixed and
eternal. They wanted to employ labor on their own
terms and turn working people out to starve when no
profitable business was at hand; so they quite naturally
believed that any Government interference with their
right to do as they pleased was "bad." Their literary
apologist, Macaulay, clothed their articles of faith in
such magnificent rhetoric that even the tiredest business.
man could keep awake reading it at night.

Closely examined, what is this creed of individualism?
Macaulay defines it beautifully in the passage which the
New York bank and our happy advertising agency
quoted so joyously. Let the Government maintain
peace, defend property, reduce the cost of litigation,
and observe economy in expenditure --- that is all. Do
American business men want peace all the time, in Nicaragua,
for instance, when their undertakings are disturbed?
Or in Haiti or Santo Domingo? Property must
be defended, of course. But whose property? And what
about the cost of litigation and economy in expenditures?
If they would tell their hired men in law offices
to cut the costs of law, something might happen. As
for expenditures, do they really mean to abolish subsidies,
bounties, and appropriations-in-aid from which
they benefit? Speaking brutally, they do not. That is
not the kind of economy in expenditures which they demand;
they prefer to cut off a few dollars from the
Children's Bureau.

Then comes Macaulay's system of private economy:
let capital find its most lucrative course alone, unaided:
no Government tariffs, subsidies, bounties, and
special privileges. That is the first item. Do American
business men who shout for individualism believe in
that? Certainly not. So that much is blown out of the
water. Macaulay's next item is: let commodities find
their fair price. Do the gentlemen who consolidate,
merge, and make price understandings want to allow
prices to take their "natural course"? By no means;
they are trying to effect combinations that will hold
prices up to the point of the largest possible profit.
Macaulay's third item is: let industry and intelligence
receive their natural reward. Whose industry and intelligence
and what industry and intelligence? When
these questions are asked all that was clear and simple
dissolves in mist.

Then there is Macaulay's last item: let idleness and
folly reap their natural punishment. That was a fundamental
specification in the bill of Manchesterism. Malthus
made it a law for the economists: the poor are
poor because they have so many babies and are improvident;
nothing can be done about it, at least by
any Government, even though it enforces drastic measures
against the spread of information on birth control.
Darwin made a natural science of it: biology sanctified
the tooth and claw struggle of business by proclaiming
the eternal tooth and claw struggle of the
jungle. If the Government will do nothing whatever, all
people will rise or sink to the level which their industry
or idleness, their intelligence or folly commands. No
distinction was made between those who were idle because
they could find no work and those who just loved
idleness for its own sake --- either in slums or mansions.
Those who hit bottom and starved simply deserved it.
That is the good, sound, logical creed of simon-pure
individualism which Herbert Spencer embedded in fifty
pounds of printed matter. To him and all his devotees,
even public schools and public libraries were anathema:
let the poor educate themselves at their own expense;
to educate them at public expense is robbery of the taxpayer
--- that industrious, intelligent, provident person
who is entitled to keep his "natural reward."

Do any stalwart individualists believe that simple
creed now? Not in England, where Liberals, professing
to carry on the Cobden--Bright tradition, vote doles for
unemployed working people. Why not let idleness and
folly get their natural punishment? Why not, indeed?
There must be a reason. Either the individualists betray
their own faith, or, as some wag has suggested, they
are afraid that they might find themselves hanging
to a lantern if they let the idle and the foolish starve,
that is, reap the natural punishment prescribed by Macaulay.
Nor do American individualists propose to let
nature take her course in this country. There is no
danger of revolution here; as Mr. Coolidge has said,
"we have had our revolution"; yet business men agree
with the politicians on feeding the hungry. It is true
that they seem to be trying to obscure the issues and
the facts by talking about the beneficence of private
charity while getting most of the dole from public
treasuries; but that is a detail. Although our rugged
individualists advertise Macaulay's creed, their faith in
it appears to be shaky or their courage is not equal to
their hopes. Then why should they try to delude themselves
and the public?

There is another side to this stalwart individualism
that also deserves consideration. Great things have been
done in its name, no doubt, and it will always have its
place in any reasoned scheme of thinking. Individual
initiative and energy are absolutely indispensable to the
successful conduct of any enterprise, and there is ample
ground for fearing the tyranny and ineptitude of Governments.
In the days of pioneering industry in England,
in our pioneering days when forests were to be
cut and mountain fastnesses explored, individualism was
the great dynamic which drove enterprise forward. But
on other pages of the doom book other entries must be
made. In the minds of most people who shout for individualism
vociferously, the creed, stripped of all flashy
rhetoric, means getting money, simply that and nothing
more. And to this creed may be laid most of the
shame that has cursed our cities and most of the scandals
that have smirched our Federal Government.

That prince of bosses, Croker, put the individualist
creed in its bare logical form when he said that he was
working for his own pocket all the time, just as "every
man in New York is working for his pocket." Fall,
Doheny, and Sinclair were all splendid individualists;
they explained that they hoped to make money out of
their transactions, even while they covered their operations
with the mantle of patriotism --- national defense.
Tammany judges, Connolly and his iron pipe,
Doyle with his split fees, and policemen growing rich
on vice are all individualists of the purest brand. W. B.
Shearer collecting money from ship-building concerns
to make a naval scare so that they might increase their
profits belongs to the same school. Britten, bringing a
fleet to Montauk Point to boom real estate in which
he is interested, does nothing reprehensible under the
Manchester creed; his capital is finding "its most lucrative
course." Wilder and Bardo, representing shipping
interests, when they spend money in Washington "educating"
members of Congress, are following the law of
the game. They are perfect individualists. The ruinous
chaos in coal and oil is to be attributed to the same
Darwinian morality. Finally, Al Capone, with his private
enterprise in racketeering, is a supreme individualist:
he wants no Government interference with his business,
not even the collection of income taxes; if he is
"let alone" he will take care of himself and give some
money to soup kitchens besides.

The cold truth is that the individualist creed of
everybody for himself and the devil take the hindmost
is principally responsible for the distress in which
Western civilization finds itself --- with investment racketeering
at one end and labor racketeering at the other.
Whatever merits the creed may have had in days of
primitive agriculture and industry, it is not applicable
in an age of technology, science, and rationalized economy.
Once useful, it has become a danger to society.
Every thoughtful business man who is engaged in management
as distinguished from stock speculation knows
that stabilization, planning, orderly procedure, prudence,
and the adjustment of production to demand
are necessary to keep the economic machine running
steadily and efficiently. Some of our most distinguished
citizens --- Owen D. Young, Gerard Swope, Nicholas
Murray Butler, and Otto Kahn, for example --- have, in
effect, warned the country that only by planning can
industry avoid the kind of disaster from which we are
now suffering; on all sides are signs of its coming ---
perhaps soon, perhaps late, but inevitably.

And all of them know that this means severe restraints
on the anarchy celebrated in the name of individualism.
The task before us, then, is not to furbish
up an old slogan, but to get rid of it, to discover how
much planning is necessary, by whom it can best be
done, and what limitations must be imposed on the historic
doctrine of Manchesterism. And to paraphrase
Milton, methinks puissant America, mewing her mighty
youth, will yet kindle her undazzled eyes at the full
midday beam, purge and unscale her long abused sight,
while timorous and flocking birds, with those that love
the twilight, flutter about, amazed at what she means,
and in their envious gabble would prognosticate a year
of sects and schisms.
