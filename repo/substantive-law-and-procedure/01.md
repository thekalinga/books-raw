::: chapter-content
THERE seems to be a general assumption today that the "Science of Law"
is not adequately performing its function in the judicial process. When
a great lawyer can voice the general opinion of the bar in stating that
the confusion and uncertainty caused by a vast mass of decisions and
principles is growing worse from year to year^[^1]^, it is inevitable
that various conflicting attitudes toward this science should take the
place of a former uncritical acceptance. The conflict may be described,
somewhat inadequately^[^2]^, in a few phrases:

1.  A struggle to preserve old creeds against a growing skepticism;
2.  An unconstructive skeptical attitude, either amused or discouraged,
    which proposes nothing;
3.  An enthusiastic search for eternal verities through new
    methodologies on which there is no agreement.

This situation makes the law today the most fascinating of the social
sciences^[^3]^. Nevertheless, from the point of view of the practical
administration of justice, the undermining of old values seems to the
writer to be one of the factors in a certain loss of prestige of the
courts. In institutions, just as in individuals, the loss of self
assurance is always followed by a loss of power. And if certain
institutions, such as the courts or the church are not supported by a
generally accepted creed or philosophy, they lose the peculiar prestige
and respect to which they owe their influence.^[^4]^ Thus our modern
skepticism about substantive law has brought us face to face with an
ancient paradox which may be expressed in this way: If courts --- or at
least persons who deal with courts --- did not so firmly believe that
justice was dispensed according to the inexorable dictates of impersonal
logical science, our machinery for the administration of law would not
exist as we know it today. Just as an individual must cherish dreams and
illusions, so also must his judicial institutions.

For this reason judges, at least while they are speaking from the bench,
must talk of substantive law as a scientific body of principles which
govern society. This unquestionably has a profound effect not only on
the attitude of society toward them, but also on their attitude toward
the problems which they attempt to solve. A free people resents
government by individuals. They insist that they will only obey the
self-imposed restraints which they see fit to impose on themselves. The
method by which courts are supposed to eliminate the personal and
arbitrary element from their decisions is supposed to be found in a
science of substantive law. Without such a conception the present power
and prestige of an independent judiciary would be difficult to maintain.

In the discussion which follows, the writer assumes without argument
that the work of most legal scholars will be directed toward preserving
and insuring the efficient operation of an independent judiciary as we
know it today. That there are other fields in which legal scholarship is
needed is unquestioned. But the particular task of restating substantive
law, whether in text books, articles, or by the American Law Institute
is certainly directed toward that end. If that kind of study is to be
effective in guiding an existing institution which claims to be applying
precepts, standards, and principles of substantive law, it becomes
necessary to understand just what part this conception of substantive
law plays in the operation of that institution. The problem is not
philosophical, but entirely practical.

# THE FUNCTION OF THE CONCEPT OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW {.chapter-title}
:::

::: chapter-content
To look at the concept of a science of substantive law as a practical
factor in the operation of courts, requires a shift of emphasis from the
study of legal doctrine to a study of the operation of an institution
--- which is a difficult shift for a lawyer to make. He has been trained
to assume that substantive law governs society, and that courts were
only set up as incidents to its enforcement. We may illustrate this by
an analogy. If one attempted to study the Mormon colonization of the
West by centering attention on the rules, standards, and principles
found in the Book of Mormon, on the assumption that Brigham Young was
its humble instrument, the resulting picture would be somewhat
distorted. Certainly the creed had a profound effect on the movement.
Without it, or some other philosophy, we would have had simply a group
of persons engaged in agriculture or trade. But the effect of the Book
of Mormon could hardly be estimated by logical deduction from its
principles. An objective examination would be necessary for either
information or reform. Yet it would have been difficult for a devout
Mormon of that day to make that examination. In the same way it is not
easy for the legal scholar to make the court the center of his study and
to consider the doctrines of substantive law only as factors in
preserving its power and independence, in determining its attitude, and
in furnishing it with a method of expression. In spite of its
difficulty, this shift of emphasis from doctrines to courts needs to be
made if we are either to understand, reform, or restate any part of our
judicial system. It can not be made by judges engaged in the actual
operation of a system. It must, therefore, be done by scholars who are,
or at least should be, studying that system objectively.

The writer will therefore attempt to examine our judicial organization
in order to ascertain the part which "substantive law" and "procedure"
are playing or may play in its operation. It is necessary at the outset
to point out that in considering" substantive law" we have in mind only
that science of arrangement and interpretation peculiar to courts, and
not the various other forms of social compulsion^[^5]^ which exist in
every society whether it has an independent judiciary or a despotism.
There are thousands of rules, statutes, institutional habits, directions
--- some actively enforced by all sorts of agencies, others dead, others
occasionally invoked --- existing under every form of government^[^6]^.
They are often called "law." They are, however, not that science of law
with which law schools and legal scholars are concerned when they study
bodies of learning such as torts, contracts, trusts, equity, all bound
together by the clasp of jurisprudence. We may be permitted to ignore
the social compulsions of other institutions when we are examining
courts, because those institutions are no part of the peculiar machinery
of the courts and are only an incidental part of the study of
"law."^[^7]^? The substantive law which is being restated for the
guidance of judges does not deal with the changing mass of directions
and rules which harass every organized society, but with a science of
fundamental principles peculiar to courts. Other departments of the
government get along without these concepts. No organized body of
learning concerning rules of the Postmaster General's department in
action is ever opposed to those rules in books. Realists and
fundamentalists do not clash over how the United States Steel Company is
applying its rules, standards and principles, with which it is
bountifully supplied. With the rules and directions which exist in every
form of government or social control we are not here concerned. We are
only examining the function of that science of law, usually referred to
as substantive law, and its inseparable partner, procedure, which has
its peculiar utility in connection with courts.

In examining our judicial institutions objectively, instead of
classifying doctrines, we will classify the persons connected with them
according to their functions. For our purposes, we propose a division
into (1) lawyers, (2) judges, who sometimes sit as "courts," sometimes
as "commissions," and sometimes as "bureaus," and (3) legal scholars. We
find them all working in a sort of verbal haze which deepens as we
approach the courts, becoming almost impenetrable when we reach the
legal scholars. Lumped together these individuals make up our machinery
for the administration of justice, as opposed to the mere enforcement of
rules and the determination of disputes. We will consider them
separately in their relation to the concept of substantive law and its
handmaiden, procedure.

The Lawyers. It is not so hard to understand what the lawyers are doing,
in spite of the fact that they use a rather complicated language, and
disappear from time to time into the haze to attempt to obtain the
blessing of the judges on their completed work. Their mode of speech may
be involved but their objects are generally quite understandable. They
are advising people how to trade, to build, or to live so that their
neighbors may not be able to invoke higher governmental authority
against them, and in this pursuit they invoke many formulae and
incantations which unfortunately are not uniformly successful in
obtaining the desired result. However, it is easy to see at least what
they are trying to do, and to know whether they have succeeded or failed
at it, because their object is usually the very definite one of helping
a particular individual in a particular thing. But when they become
engaged in an effort to fulfill their duty as "officers of the court"
their objectives become vague, and it is difficult to tell what they are
doing or even what they are aiming to do. Such efforts, generally
confined to public meetings, result in speeches like the following,
reported from an annual meeting of the American Bar Association:

> America looks to the bar today for leadership, as she has always
> looked. It was the lawyers who led us in our struggles for
> independence.... And it has been the lawyers who, not only upon the
> bench, but at the bar, in the legislature and in executive positions,
> have moulded our institutions to meet the changing life of our people.
> The charge that they have allowed the law to become antiquated and
> obsolete cannot be sustained. While changes are needed in procedural
> law, these changes are already in process of realization and much has
> already been accomplished. Great problems confront the nation, but the
> bar of America will rise to meet them, as it has always risen in the
> past.^[^8]^

It seems, at first sight, extraordinary that any body of busy men should
take so much responsibility on their shoulders. Yet that they are
constantly doing it is attested by the fact that speeches of this tenor
and effect made during the last century would fill hundreds of volumes
and that no meeting of any bar association ever occurs without at least
one being made. The net results on institutions other than courts of
this assumption of general responsibility are somewhat doubtful, but the
fact that the bar sincerely feels it is very significant in its effect
on the judicial system, from articles on jurisprudence in law reviews
down to learned discussions in "jurisdictional" terms on the omission of
the details in the service of summons.^[^9]^

As we study these speeches we are impressed with the thought that we
have read something like them before. It occurs to us that they sound
strangely like the confident exhortations of ministers of the gospel
fifty or one hundred years ago, when the church was too confident and
sure of its purpose to examine that purpose to see whether it was
capable of reduction to intelligible terms. It is not the preaching of
the modernist, full of doubts and wavering over his own concepts. It is
the assertion of men who know that all right-thinking people must
necessarily agree with them.

Compare a great lawyer speaking on the recall of judicial decisions, on
the assumption that such a thing was impossible in a civilized
community, with Reverend Samuel Miller, speaking at Princeton, nearly
one hundred years before.

> We must choose between having prescribed rules of right conduct,
> binding in every case so long as they exist, even though there may be
> occasional inconvenience through their restraint upon our freedom of
> action, and having no rules at all to prevent us from doing in every
> case whatever we wish to do at the time. .. A sovereign people which
> declares that all men have certain inalienable rights, and imposes
> upon itself the great impersonal rules of conduct deemed necessary for
> the preservation of those rights, and at the same time declares that
> it will disregard those rules whenever in any particular case it is
> the wish of a majority of its voters to do so, establishes as complete
> a contradiction to the fundamental principles of our Government as it
> is possible to conceive. It abandons absolutely the conception of a
> justice which is above majorities, of a right in the weak which the
> strong are bound to respect. It denies the vital truth taught by
> religion and realized in the hard experience of mankind, and which has
> inspired every constitution America has produced and every great
> declaration for human freedom since Magna Charta the truth that human
> nature needs to distrust its own impulses and passions and to
> establish for its own control the restraining and guiding influence of
> declared principles of action.^[^10]^

The Reverend Miller in 1826 said:

> Exodus, XXXII. 26.
>
> "Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the
> Lord's side?
>
> "When this solemn question was asked, the camp of Israel was in a very
> awful situation. Moses had been in the Mount, conversing with God, and
> receiving the Law from His lips, forty days and forty nights. ... O
> what an amazing scene was here! That the very people who, a few weeks
> before, had witnessed the wonderful displays of Divine power on their
> behalf, in Egypt, and at the Red-Sea; and afterwards the still more
> terrifick wonders of Mount Sinai, with the thunderings, and
> lightnings, and voices and earthquake ... that this very people should
> so soon have forgotten all their signal deliverences, and all their
> solemn vows, and begged to be placed under the guidance of a dumb
> idol, --- presents an example of infatuation and depravity, as
> enormous as it was degrading."^[^11]^

The similarity between these two utterances is that each is adapted to
the end of making the audience assume a reverential attitude toward a
human institution. In the first it was the court, in the second, the
church. Neither can be subject to analysis. Why should a court be so
much more careful of our freedom than an administrative tribunal? Is
there really less freedom in this country where it has been said that we
have a bill of rights, but no rights, than in France where they claim
more individual rights, but no bill? Such inquiries are beside the
point. The important thing is the existence of this attitude toward our
judicial institution; because all that a human institution can ever be,
is a group of individuals plus an attitude. With such an attitude
substantive law begins.

The Judges Sitting as Courts, Commissions, and Bureaus. Leaving our
examination of the lawyers and penetrating deeper into the haze where
the judges are found, we discover that certain things, which might seem
elsewhere unimportant, assume a very deep significance. The name under
which the judges assemble seems to control their temperaments and make
them reasonable or unreasonable as the case may be. For example, if they
sit as a bureau all of the bar, and even the public outside the bar,
view the situation with alarm. A few bureaus are necessary, perhaps, in
a complicated civilization, but if the bureaus increase in number and
power, we suddenly find that without knowing it we have created a
"bureaucracy," which is one of the worst fates that can befall a free
people.

The distinction between bureaus and courts is important. Courts are
bound by precedent, and bureaus are bound by red tape. Of course courts
are forced to follow precedent even when it leads to absurd results
because of their solemn obligation not to do anything in the future very
much different from what they have done in the past. But bureaus in
allowing themselves to be bound by red tape do so out of pure malice and
lack of regard for the fundamentals of freedom, because they have taken
no oath not to violate the rules and analogies of the past. Therefore
they are much worse than courts because courts only act unreasonably
when they can't help it, and bureaus act unreasonably when it is in
their power to do differently. This is brought out very clearly in a
recent editorial, Bernt Balchen Discovers Bureaucracy:

> According to a ruling of the department of labor Bernt Balchen,
> Admiral Byrd's pilot in the flight over the south pole, cannot receive
> his citizenship papers. Balchen, a native of Norway, declared his
> intention in 1927. It is held that he has failed to meet the condition
> of five years' continuous residence in the United States. The Byrd
> antarctic voyage took him out of the country, although he was on a
> ship flying the American flag, was an invaluable member of an American
> expedition, and in a region to which there is an American claim
> because of the exploration and occupation of it by Americans, this
> region being Little America.
>
> The bureau of naturalization explains that it cannot proceed on the
> assumption that Little America is American soil. That would be
> trespass on international questions where it has no sanction. So far
> as the bureau is concerned, Balchen was out of the country and
> technically has not complied with the law of naturalization. The
> upshot is that, unless a way of modifying this opinion is found, a man
> whom the country would like to have as a citizen cannot soon become
> one simply because he took an invaluable part in an enterprise of
> which the country is proud.^[^12]^

This editor had a definite notion of the superiority of judges sitting
as courts over judges sitting as bureaus. While, of course, instances
can be found where courts have acted just as outrageously, a close
examination of such decisions always shows, nevertheless, either that
they were forced into such action by a greater principle, such as the
one against judicial legislation, or against hard cases being allowed to
make bad law, or else that they were wrong according to the principles
of the common law, in which case the decision does not count and we may
ignore it.

If, on the other hand, the judges sit not as a bureau or department but
as a commission with quasi-judicial powers, the danger is not so great.
Nevertheless it represents a tendency which deserves careful scrutiny,
and we must be at all times cognizant of just where it is leading us.
The suspicion that has greeted commissions, to which have been entrusted
matters of public importance, never quite disappears until the
commission is firmly established, and the dangerous tendencies of such
movements are constantly talked over for a long time afterward.

The distinction between a bureau which is a very bad sort of thing and a
commission with quasi-judicial powers which is well enough in its place
is that the commission, while not exactly a court, nevertheless is more
like a court than it is like a bureau. Therefore if we are very watchful
of these commissions and see that the inevitable mixing up of the three
great branches of the government --- the executive, legislative, and
judicial --- occurs only on lower levels, and in comparatively minor
matters such as the valuation of railroads, the fixing of rates,
workmen's compensation, banking, taxation, trade regulation, zoning,
immigration, irrigation of arid lands, drainage, insurance, and similar
things which do not involve the great principles of freedom --- as, for
example, a suit for libel and slander, replevin, or criminal
conversation does --- we may escape this new form of despotism. It is
particularly important, however, to have a law court in the background
ready to keep in check each commission which has been given
quasi-judicial powers, because in this way the powers which had become
so muddled when passing through the commission, again become separated
and run in clear and separate streams and everything becomes less
arbitrary and personal and more subject to the fundamental rules of law.
Thus it is that, in examining the individuals of our judicial system who
are acting as judges, we find that a jarring note is struck when they
sit as a commission and not as a court, but that with proper vigilance
the thing is being kept fairly well under control.

Turning our attention to those judges who are sitting as "courts"
because they are the most mysterious part of the whole judicial
institution, we find it difficult to tell just what they are doing which
makes them so different from other bodies. Of course they are settling
disputes, but many other persons are engaged in this, such as officers
of business corporations, bureaus, government officials --- in fact
almost everyone occupying a position of financial or business power over
others has his part in the settlement of disputes. It is not even clear
that they are settling the most important disputes because the more
important lawyers seem to spend very little time with them, and
statistical examination of what courts do discloses the fact that much
of their business involves rather trifling matters. They are also
spending a very large part of their time forcing recalcitrant people to
perform their obligations by means of judgments and executions, but many
other persons are doing that, in different ways, including policemen,
departments, bureaus, and officers of various kinds. They are
establishing a procedure and following precedents in settling these
disputes, but so is everyone else who conducts continuing activity along
these lines. These are all the common functions of many institutions and
certainly no system of courts has a monopoly on them.

Yet in spite of the comparative unimportance of what they do, courts
appear to have found a way of doing it which has brought them
overwhelming prestige and respect. They seem to have induced the
feeling, even among persons who know nothing of court methods and have
never been inside a court room, that there they will find protection.
Even when they fail miserably to give protection to someone who seeks
it, such is their demeanor and attitude that he - or at least his
friends --- feel that it was not the fault of the court that protection
failed. Perhaps it was the fault of the legislature, perhaps of the jury
--- at least the court did the best it could, and had it done otherwise
it would have, in some mysterious way, imperilled the whole system of
protection to others. Commissions, composed of experts, can be violently
criticized by editorial writers. But if the matter is appealed to a
non-expert court, sitting on the same question and using the same
criteria, it appears to be settled in the only way possible under the
law. Our quarrel is, then, with the law, which we must respect until it
is changed, and not with the court which applied it.

Courts are protecting the liberties of Englishmen though in 1927 they
committed approximately five thousand persons to jail for non-payment of
debt.^[^13]^ The imprisonment was the fault of the law and not the
court. It is true that the Parliament in 1869 had abolished imprisonment
for debt, but this did not include judgments which the debtor had the
means to pay yet wilfully refused to pay. The difficulty that it was
entirely too easy for the creditor to establish the fact that the debtor
had the means to pay, is only a procedural fault for which no court can
be held to account.^[^14]^ It must simply do the best it can with
procedure as it finds it. Therefore the Rt. Hon. Lord Hewart of Bury,
Lord Chief Justice of England was quite right in ignoring such details
as this when he wrote his book on The New Despotism in which he pointed
out the dangers from the arbitrary actions of men who judge cases
sitting as bureaus instead of as courts, and who thus are creating a new
form of despotism in England.

It appears from this that bureaus, even though given absolute power to
enforce the decrees of other persons in the government, do not use that
judgment in enforcing them which is so characteristic of courts. They do
not, on the one hand, check the government in its wilder flights of
regulatory fancy, nor on the other hand are they able to carry out the
decrees of the government efficiently because they are too bound down by
that particularly absurd form of rule and precedent known as red tape.
Courts, on the contrary, do not concern themselves with red tape, but
only with procedure and substantive law. Both may sometimes be
antiquated, but that is never the fault of the court, whereas the red
tape is always the fault of the bureau. Applying this principle to the
cases of the persons imprisoned for debt, we at once see that if it had
been done by a bureau it would have been an annoying invasion of
personal liberty accomplished in an arbitrary way. When it is done by
the court even those in jail realize that it is not the fault of the
court, but the fault of the legislature which forced this procedure on
the court. Thus it appears that even when courts refuse to protect the
freedom of individuals they do it for such high motives that everyone
should respect them for it.

From this we may reach our final definition of just what courts,
commissions, and bureaus are.

1.  A court is a body of judges whose decisions are either: (1)
    right, (2) caused by the fault of someone else (usually the
    legislature), or (3) unfortunate but unavoidable accidents due to
    the circumstance that no human system can be perfect.
2.  A bureau is a body which, if it happens to make a wrong decision,
    has no one to blame but itself, and if it happens to make a right
    decision, offers us no assurance that it will do so again.
3.  A commission with quasi-judicial powers is half-way between a court
    and a bureau.

Our next investigation naturally leads us to inquire what peculiar
talisman judges who sit as courts possess which gives them such
advantages over judges who sit as bureaucrats. This question does not
detain us long because the answer is on everyone's lips. The courts
represent the supremacy of "law." It is judges sitting as courts who
guarantee us a government of laws and not of men, whereas judges sitting
as bureaus or as executives are always trying to substitute a government
of men and not of laws. The former is, of course, the better form of
government because the laws are based on fundamental principles which
gradually exnd to meet changed conditions, whereas very few individuals
can be trusted with such power. Therefore the medal given by the
American Bar Association for conspicuous service in American
jurisprudence has for its motto " To the End that this shall be a
Government of Laws and not of Men." In presenting that medal for the
first time in 1929 the distinguished speaker said:

> It seems to me those words have been aptly chosen because they
> epitomize the whole service of Chief Justice Marshall whose head
> appears upon the medal. They represent the views of every man who
> renders conspicuous service to the cause of American jurisprudence,
> and in the last analysis, they typify the ultimate purpose and end of
> the American Bar Association itself.^[^16]^

It is obvious that our belief that courts are the chief guardians of the
supremacy of law is the reason why we adopt such a respectful attitude
toward them. Yet this supremacy of law is a vague and very hotly
contested phrase, on the meaning of which there is no agreement. It
appears that two of its functions are: (I) to protect us from the
tyranny of the majority and (2) to make results of disputes more logical
and predictable.

The first has something to do with the interpretation of a written
constitution which is supreme in this country. However, it is not clear
that this written constitution itself is the real protection from the
tyranny of the majority because courts in England furnish the same kind
of protection without a constitution.

In this country, of course, the constitution is above the courts, yet,
curiously enough, if at the same time we had not placed the courts above
the constitution we are led to believe some form of tyranny would have
developed. It is also interesting to note that courts, because they
represent the supremacy of law, protect us from the tyranny of the
majority, even though in most instances the judges are elected by the
majority. Bureaus, on the other hand, are usually appointed, but because
they do not represent the supremacy of law they are less likely to
respect the rights of an individual against a majority than an elected
judge. In France the chief bulwark of liberty is the " droit
administratif" but this apparent paradox is explained by the Lord Chief
Justice of England in his book on the dangers of administrative law as
follows:

> The system of so-called administrative 'law' in this country has
> little or no analogy to the 'droit administratif' of the Continent,
> and is an indescribably more objectionable method. ... In a word, the
> 'administrative tribunals' of the Continent are real Courts, and what
> they administer is law, though a different law from the ordinary
> law.^[^17]^

The second feature of the supremacy of law, which is to make results of
disputes more logical and predictable by the application of principles
or the development of principles, is ordinarily referred to as the
common law. It is a science of reconciling principles and precedents in
an orderly way so that one will grow out of the other. Thus nothing
absolutely new should come from a court without the aid of the
legislature, and such new principles as appear should be the logical
development of older ones applied to new cases. It appears, however,
that very many new problems can be solved so much better without the aid
of this science that administrative tribunals are formed just to escape
it, and the area to which this science is applicable is being made
smaller and smaller. This happened once before when courts of equity
began to grow up against the substantive law of the time. Now that
equity has become part of the substantive law, a new court seems to be
necessary. However, such general theories of the function of substantive
law, as well as its more comprehensive systems of methodology seem to be
the peculiar province, not of courts and lawyers, but of a third body of
persons whom we have designated as legal scholars. It is interesting to
note that no other human institution except the church, has any
comparable body of learned expounders.

The Legal Scholars and Substantive Law. Legal scholars, insofar as they
are concerned with the concept of substantive law, appear to be doing
two things.^[^18]^ First, they are explaining what law is --- its nature
and sources. Second, they are engaged in various forms of restatement of
its varied concepts. Back of all the different kinds of restatement
seems to be the assumption that substantive law is designed to govern
human conduct outside of courts, instead of being a method of
classification in the course of the legal process. Their declared
intention seems to be a search for predictability. They are creating
formulae which are supposed to be equally useful in all of the following
situations, which are included in the general term law: (1) for the
purpose of classifying past decisions in books so that they will be
readily available as analogies; (2) for the purpose of guessing the
result of a dispute on which no suit has been started; (3) for the
purpose of writing a brief in a case where two logically unanswerable
briefs are possible; (4) for the purpose of aiding the trial court in
making a record in such form that a reversal is difficult; (5) for the
purpose of giving analogies and terms to an appellate court which is
writing an opinion; and (6) for the purpose of guiding human conduct
outside of courts apart from the settlement of any particular
dispute.^[^19]^

The law of torts, or contracts, or sales, for example, is supposed to
give a definite answer in all of these situations. In such situations as
it fails to do this, we fall back on the theory that there will always
be borderline cases. The object of the various forms of restatement is
to limit the number of borderline cases, and in this attempt it involves
itself in infinite complications. A restatement has two avowed purposes;
first, to furnish a guide to human conduct so that individuals may avoid
disputes, and second, to make the result of disputes certain. In doing
this, restatements seem on the surface to be concerned with rules. Yet
the bulk of their material ignores the rules and devotes itself to
principles for the application of rules. Statutes receive little
consideration unless they are, like the Statute of Frauds, not rules,
but the storehouse of legal argument and analogy. A statute which is
sufficiently definite to be a direction and not a logical weapon is
ignored.

For example, a statute that a corporation must start with three
incorporators is typical of the thousands of directions which are not
found among substantive law principles. It is a direction to the
secretary of state which anyone can understand. If, however, the
secretary of state issues a certificate to two incorporators, and the
question arises whether in a particular suit such a corporation can
collect a debt, the substantive law appears to justify, and to make
inevitable, any result which the court chooses to reach. The actual
result of this accomplishment is not predictability of result but
predictability of the kind of arguments which will be the intellectual
currency in such disputes. Attorneys and courts want to know how they
shall talk. Legal scholars regulate this very important field of
procedural etiquette and call it substantive law. It is difficult to see
how it can be a guide to conduct outside of courts, because laymen
neither know anything about it, nor, as Coke pointed out to the King, is
it possible for them to know anything about it. The paradox is that, if
it were sufficiently simple for them to understand, a bureau or
policeman could settle the dispute, and we would not need to discuss the
concept of substantive law.

Thus "substantive law," because its formulae and logical processes can
never be openly repudiated by a court, may be at times a very rigid
master of judicial decision. Courts will not deny the validity of a
philosophy which gives them power. Even though a doctrine is only a
method of argument, once it is placed under the protecting mantle of
substantive law, it can not be treated in a simple and matter-of-fact
way to accomplish a result. The only escape from a principle is a
greater principle. Commissions dealing with the same problems possess a
more elastic power. Our different attitude toward them permits us to
offer personal criticism if they blindly adhere to any verbalism. Hence
we can force them to talk about the particular problem involved.^[^20]^

From this discussion we may attempt to define that concept of
substantive law which is peculiar to courts, and the part it plays in
the work of legal scholars.

Substantive law, insofar as it is peculiar to courts, is the
justification of the attitude that courts are acting impersonally and
that their government is one of laws and not of men. It is not an
institution which governs society, yet its function requires it always
to appear to be. Without an independent judiciary we would have no
occasion to use it among our ideals. Something else, such as the Divine
Right of Kings, or the Five-Year Plan, would take its place.

Legal writers, scholars, and philosophers furnish the necessary
theological background without which no abstraction which gives prestige
to a human institution is able to survive.

Two illustrations of the effectiveness of the concept of substantive law
in the public mind will suffice. A short time ago the World Court
decided against the German-Austrian Customs Union. Newspapers generally
regarded this as a political decision and used it to prove that the
World Court was not a court at all. Of course the decision was no more
political than most court decisions on economic or social problems, but
the fact that the court lacked a complicated and generally respected
logical science for the interpretation of international affairs made it
impossible for it to make the result seem impersonal and inevitable.
Hence the criticism was directed at the court, instead of at the
unfortunate state of international law.

In West Virginia the board of public utilities was authorized to grant
water-power franchises. The question on which the grant was to hang was
whether the advantages to the state outweighed the disadvantages. The
act allowed appeals first to the circuit court and then to the Supreme
Court. The grant of an important franchise under this act became the
subject of a bitter political dispute. The action of the lawyers on the
commission was characterized as a "public utility grab" in spite of the
fact that there was no evidence of anything but the best of faith. On
appeal, the case was heard by a judge without any of the skill in the
particular matters which the commission had acquired by experience.
Nevertheless when his decision was handed down, criticism ceased. The
"law" had spoken, and if the result was undesirable, it was not the
fault of the judge. Later the Supreme Court found that the entire act
was unconstitutional,^[^21]^ and the fight was transferred to the
legislature. Of course it was just as impossible to predict the result
before a court as it was before a commission. Yet the notion of the
supremacy of a substantive law residing in the court, completely removed
the question from the public turmoil of individual criticism.

The science of law peculiar to courts has its utility and effect, as we
have seen, in several ways. (1) It gives the court the atmosphere of
impersonal and inevitable justice which compels respect. (2) It shifts
criticism of the result away from the judge or the court to some body
which is supposed to have the power to change the "law." (3) It gives
the court a certain attitude toward the problems which confront it by
making relevant ancient analogies. (4) It expresses general directions
and ideals called principles.

Rules and definite directions, of course, appear wherever we turn, and
whether we are dealing with courts or other bodies. However, there is a
great difference between the way these rules are applied when we treat
them with the attitude induced by the science of law and when we treat
them with the attitude of a bureau or an administrative official. The
difference is illustrated in a book by a well known English
scholar,^[^22]^ in which, in different essays, he writes of \" The Ratio
Decidendi of a Case," referring to such things as contracts,
consideration, and torts, and of the English system of taxing costs. The
one seems to him to be part of the science of law, to be considered in
the light of general theory, fundamental in its nature. The taxation of
costs, on the other hand, is treated as a practical problem to which no
methodology of the discovery of principles scientifically arrived at is
necessary. If we call a summons "process " which is necessary to give
the court "jurisdiction," concepts of all kinds troop in, from the
difference between "mandatory" and " directory" provisions, to
"presumptions in favor of the judgment of a court of record" and the
difference between "direct" and " collateral" attack. If the method of
giving notice is not "process," as happens in the case of a motion in
the course of the proceedings, then no principles, concepts, or theories
appear to trouble us in the books.^[^23]^ Illustrations might be
multiplied indefinitely. The point is that it is always possible to
treat any rule with the attitude induced by substantive law and that the
moment we do so a philosophy begins to cluster around it and only men
peculiarly learned in the law can talk about it at all. This is what
Coke so carefully explained to King James. The King was under the
impression that the determination of whether Coke's court or the
ecclesiastical commission should deal with a certain case depended on
the application of rules which he was quite competent to discuss.^[^24]^
But Coke pointed out that there was more than ordinary rules here ---
there was a science of law which depended on more books than the King
had had time to read.^[^25]^ The King might have been able to discuss
the advisability of assigning a case to one of two judges, but where the
assignment was between a common-law and an ecclesiastical court, it
depended on a science of law which was not only above the King but which
the King could not even understand. And thus the prestige of an
independent judiciary achieved one of its first triumphs.

# THE EFFECT OF TOO MUCH SUBSTANTIVE LAW {.chapter-title}
:::

::: chapter-content
The function of substantive law as the embodiment of the great ideals of
an independent judiciary has today become confused by an attempt to
apply it in detail to too many cases. Legal scholars have felt it their
peculiar duty to clarify the situation and to combat the skeptical
attitude toward the decisions of courts for which that confusion was
responsible. The American Law Institute is only part of this continuing
effort. Law reviews have been filled with attempts to clarify particular
fields. The usual method of attack, however, has been based on the
assumption that the confusion was the fault of an untutored judiciary
who had failed to reason and reconcile with that nicety which the
occasion required. Therefore, if the existing cases are only thoroughly
sifted, certain fundamental principles will finally appear which
everyone must recognize to be the principles on which appellate courts
and trial courts must operate until relieved by the legislature. The
discovery of these principles depends on the examination of what
appellate courts have said, without any particular regard to its
utility. The reason utility can not be a test is that substantive law
governs society outside the courts, and can only be changed by
legislative enactment (except, of course, that minor gaps can be filled
or new principles discovered).

The effect of this notion has been to make our system of judicial logic
grow like a snowball. Since so many of our rules are treated with the
attitude of substantive law, it has been difficult to talk about the
problems involved. An ordinary rule can be treated in the light of its
purpose and bent to meet a practical situation. A principle of
substantive law can also be modified, but not for practical
considerations. A greater principle must always be discovered. It is
inevitable therefore that if many of our problems are treated from the
point of view of substantive law, the bulk and complexity of the
principles of that science should increase beyond a point where any
artificial attempt to simplify by restatement is futile.

The only method of preventing the confusion of doctrines and precedents
is to treat them as ideals and general directions and to insulate them
from the cases which distort them into so many complicated and difficult
shapes. This seems paradoxical, yet it is based on the obvious
proposition that out of ten selected cases a legal scholar can build a
more coherent set of principles than he can out of ten thousand chosen
at random. We may illustrate it by calling attention to the success of
the English system. Here we find no skeptics undermining its prestige.
The supposed superiority of the English judges is heralded with great
humility wherever American lawyers gather. This does not mean that the
English judges are really superior, but that the conception of
substantive law is giving them a prestige which removes them from
individual criticism.

What has happened in England in the years following the Judicature Act
is not the sudden substitution of enlightened judges for bigoted ones,
but the insulation of the science of substantive law from the practical
problem of litigation. Instead of rigidly applying the substantive-law
doctrines through the principle of stare decisis, as many imagine, the
English have been devising practical escapes which separate principles
of substantive law from the actual cases which confuse them. This has
been done by transferring power to the trial courts and making it
difficult for appellate courts to make a written application of
doctrines to any case not fought with unusual determination and
disregard of expense. Thus substantive law exists at the top of the very
practical English system as an ideal exposition of a way of thought and
expression.

The ways in which this has been accomplished are interesting. First,
that vast mass of principles which are treated in America from a
substantive law point of view under the name of pleading and the various
steps before trial, are removed from the logical interpretation of
appellate courts by the simple device of interposing a master between
the litigant and the judge.^[^26]^ In criminal cases the complicated
substantive science loses its importance because the court of criminal
appeal may treat cases individually and even increase the penalty,
instead of sitting solely as a court of error.^[^27]^ Third, the heavy
imposition of costs makes appeal difficult. The attorney who thinks that
a principle of substantive law is wrongly applied by a lower court must
gamble very heavily on his judgment if he wants it reviewed.^[^28]^
Finally, only selected cases are collected in the reports which make up
the libraries of available citation. Six hundred and ninety-seven
volumes make up the relevant material for legal argument.^[^29]^ We are
left to guess how many inconvenient cases from the point of view of
symmetry are buried under this important procedural device.^[^30]^ What
is left after all these selective processes constitutes the substantive
law." Of course the cases are more easily reconciled because one hundred
cases can be reconciled in a much less complicated way than a thousand.
Thus, in England substantive law performs its function as a
philosophical guide divorced from actual cases. Power is transferred to
trial courts, and to judges who are not dignified by that peculiar name.
Judicial realism is dormant as realism always is when a creed is
fulfilling its function.^[^31]^ The very practical matters which
determine litigation are taken care of in a practical way. Criticism of
decisions in the way American decisions are criticised in our law
reviews, does not exist.

It is this ability of the English to keep an ideal from too close
contact with reality which explains the prestige which they are able to
throw around their institutions. There is little positive evidence that
results in English courts are better than in ours, if we take into
consideration the intricate tasks which our courts are facing. The
evidence is only of a dignified process where the dividing line between
procedure and substantive law is so placed that it increases the area of
procedure and simplifies the judicial expression of principle.

In France the code stands as the ultimate symbol of substantive law. The
work of commentators who are more interested in principles than in
reconciling all the cases is given great weight. And finally, cases
which make these principles stand out are selected as precedents. The
gap between the code and its principles and the actual results is a
matter concealed in the double trial afforded by the lower courts, which
provides opportunity to treat the practical problems of litigation in a
practical way. Whatever the demerits of the French judicial system, at
least it has not become verbally cumbersome.

In this country the Supreme Court of the United States, in dealing with
constitutional problems, has, in recent years, been rapidly escaping
from the position of the humble instrument of constitutional doctrine,
and is being studied and recognized as a great judicial institution.
This has been accomplished by a change of attitude which permits us to
study the Court, operating through the language of the constitution,
instead of the constitution, with the Court appearing as an incidental
agency of enforcement. The skepticism of Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr.
Justice Brandeis, which recognizes, on the one hand, that doctrines do
not govern society, and, on the other, that they can be used wisely and
skilfully in governing the Court, is the kind of skepticism which
creates great institutions. In this they have been aided by a few
interpreters who have broken down the attitude which created the old
conventional course in constitutional law of fifteen years ago. As
peculiarly effective in accomplishing this I may cite Frankfurter and
Powell of Harvard, and Hamilton of Yale. Frankfurter by centering his
attention first on the problem to be solved,^[^32]^ and then on the
Supreme Court as an institution, as in The Business of the Supreme
Court^[^33]^ --- Powell by his penetrating wit, which is never used
merely for the purpose of being funny, and which illuminates like
flashes of lightning, as in his "An Imaginary Judicial Opinion"^[^34]^
--- and Hamilton, with his beautifully phrased constructive philosophy
in which the utility and future possibilities of the formulae of
constitutional law in the hands of an enlightened judge are
demonstrated, as in his "The Jurist's Art"^[^35]^ --- have made the
Supreme Court stand out as a living instrument of government. Never has
the prestige of that Court been higher. No one is worrying about
restating constitutional law so that it will be simpler and easier for
that Court to apply it. These formulae seemed to have slipped into their
proper place, as necessary tools with which the Court must work, which
limit its activities, and aid in the expression of the attitude and
ideals which it brings to the solution of governmental problems. And the
confusion incident to a written expression of these doctrines in too
many cases is prevented by a discretionary appeal.

That the bundles of concepts and logical systems found in such fields as
contracts or torts, are not different, except in the area of their
application, from the formulae of constitutional law, does not seem to
be so clearly recognized.^[^36]^ The constant attempt is to use them so
that they will control, not the processes of the court, but society in
general. They are being continually rephrased in various ways, so that
their fundamental elements can become more and more detailed and
certain. The English trick of isolating them from the general run of
litigation so that the effect of the attitude which they induce and the
general directions which they furnish will not be lost, is not realized.
An illustration may be useful here. If A tells B to report an accident,
giving only the facts and omitting so far as possible his conclusions,
this general direction will unquestionably affect the type of report.
But if A and B insist on writing books about the differences between
facts and conclusions examining in detail all the reports which have
been handed in for the past ten years, the direction will become
unintelligible. The rule will fail to function if it is analyzed in
every case. It will also fail to function if everything which has been
said about the difference between facts and conclusions, and not
expressly repudiated since the time of Lord Coke, must be preserved and
made relevant in the discussion of the report which Ð makes.^[^37]^

# PROCEDURE AS AN ESCAPE FROM SUBSTANTIVE LAW {.chapter-title}
:::

::: chapter-content
Our judicial system, objectively examined, seems to be founded on so
many imponderable psychological factors that it can never be molded by a
direct attack upon its ideals without impairing its prestige. On the
other hand, its logical machinery is so elastic that it is capable of
tremendous changes if we understand the function which that logical
machinery performs. And because of the efforts of such men as Clark,
Pound, and Sunderland to make procedure a practical thing, followed by
the missionary propaganda found in such a periodical as the Journal of
the American Judicature Society, we find that today, by calling a body
of doctrine procedure, we can take an entirely different attitude toward
it from that which we take where we call it substantive law. Anyone can
say that procedure is not fundamental, that it has only to do with the
legal process, that it does not govern the outside world, that it always
needs reform, and finally that the reform may be accomplished by a
consideration of the problem involved, not by analyzing the fundamental
principles involved in doctrine.

The distinction between procedure and substantive law is one of the most
interesting consequences of our attitude toward an independent
judiciary. Substantive law is sacred and fundamental. It represents the
experience of the ages. On it is based the freedom of the individual. It
never needs reform because its fundamental verities can always be
discovered by logical analysis. Procedure, on the other hand, is
entirely practical. It always needs, not logic, but change in the light
of practical details. It is based on the experience of the ages also,
but age with it is senility, not wisdom. Yet, in spite of these
fundamental differences, no one has ever been able to formulate any test
which will distinguish between procedure and substantive law in any
particular case. Substantive law remains the "law" which we enforce,
procedure the practical rules by which we enforce it. We therefore
always "restate" substantive law in the light of its principles, and
"reform" procedure in the light of its practical problems.

The distinction is most useful in the judicial system, once we realize
that the difference is only in attitude, that any doctrine may be
treated as procedure and the problem discussed, or as substantive law
and the principle stated. The difference between procedure and
substantive law is a movable dividing line which may be placed wherever
an objective examination of our judicial institutions indicates is
necessary. Illustrations of this may be multiplied indefinitely. We will
confine ourselves to two. The problem of the distribution of legal
business between states may be considered from the substantive-law angle
under the topics of conflicts of laws, collateral attack, process,
presumptions in favor of a court of general jurisdiction, the
distinction between lack of jurisdiction and error in exercising it, the
distinction between domicil and mere residence, the concept of doing
business, express and implied consent to be sued, conceptions of local
and transitory actions, and so on indefinitely. Or it may be considered
from the procedural angle as a practical problem of determining the
place of trial in civil actions, as Mr. Roger Foster does in two
illuminating articles.^[^38]^ From such a point of view the concepts and
theories disappear as irrelevant, without even doing violence to the
rule of stare decisis. It becomes apparent that if the court will only
talk about the problem it can easily escape the consequences of a
philosophy which is quite unfitted for its solution. Or if it can not,
in any given instance, we will at least know how to draft an act which
will treat the problem procedurally. Another example is found in the
method by which the law of sales determines where the loss of goods
destroyed by fire should fall as between buyer and seller. Obviously
what the doctrine is doing is determining in what cases the
determination of liability shall be left to a jury. Treated
substantively we find that it depends on whether "title" passed, which
in turn depends on the "intent" of the parties, which in turn may depend
on certain presumptions, from which the jury must find intent. The jury
is never permitted to find the real fact --- that the parties had no
actual intent at the time because they were thinking neither of "title"
nor of loss by fire. Treated procedurally we would talk not of intent
but of the distribution of power between the court and jury. Probably
the sales question is better solved by the apparent uniformity of the
doctrine where no better practical solution is offered,^[^39]^ and
probably the place of trial can be better solved by a procedural
treatment because the doctrine includes so many dissimilar
things.^[^40]^ We use the illustrations merely to show that there is no
doctrine of stare decisis, as opposed to stare dictum, which prevents us
from considering the practical utility of treating any problem from a
procedural point of view. Substantive law is canonized procedure.
Procedure is unfrocked substantive law.

In view of these existing legal attitudes, emphasis on the procedural
aspects, rather than on the underlying principles of any legal doctrine
can afford an effective method for immediately relieving courts and
attorneys of much of the burden arising from the myriad precedents in
this country. The law of negligence, for example, deals for the most
part with (1) the distribution of power between trial courts and juries
and (2) the ritual by which the jury is put in the proper frame of mind
to determine liability. The substantive-law solution is in part a
textbook, written through the medium of instructions, against a
background of conflicting results which certainly are not determined by
those instructions. Our formulae concerning non-prejudicial error, and
the jury's power over questions of \" fact" are sufficiently loose that
we may, if we wish, consider instructions in the light of their
purpose,^[^41]^ and remove the cases which deal with them from cases
dealing with the question whether the jury is to be permitted to pass on
the question at all. Thus we may treat any part of our substantive law
from a procedural point of view. The selection need not be based on
history but on objective utility.

In determining the utility of doctrine it is important to recognize that
the function of the legal scholar as critic or reformer is different
from that of the judge writing an opinion. The former may state his
position from the point of view of an objective examination of the court
as an institution. The latter must deal with doctrines as realities. The
penalty of uncompromising realism on the part of the judge is the
disappearance of courts as we now know them. The penalty of the belief
that the legal scholar need only state fundamental principles in a
judicial way is that uncompromising realists will flourish. The
imponderable psychological factors involved in the necessity that
critics and judges adopt different standards of values in their
respective rÃ´les may be expressed in an analogy.

The operation of our judicial institutions may be likened to the
presentation of a play. The judges are the actors on the stage moving
the audience with great lines, impressively delivered. To some in the
audience the lines carry moral lessons, inspirational ideals, and
definite directions as to how they should act in situations similar to
the one presented. To others the lines have the moving effect of great
art. Every audience will contain both types, and every person in the
audience will swing backward and forward between these two points of
view. The litigant who has sponsored the performance has been ushered
out because he was disturbing the audience (just as the formulation of
the principles of substantive law is constantly aimed at getting rid of
the litigant by making the law so certain that litigation will be
unnecessary, or telling him to resort to arbitration, or the action of a
commission). Unquestionably the play is exercising a stabilizing
influence on the manners and customs of the community.

Suppose into this very satisfactory situation we introduce a realist who
insists on interrupting the actors in their most impressive speeches by
telling the audience that it is only a theatrical performance. Or
suppose that one of the actors bends over the footlights in an aside to
explain that he is only an actor in a play. Obviously the effect of the
play is destroyed.

Suppose, on the other hand, that the directors of the play are composed
of fundamentalists who are firmly convinced of the truth and objective
importance of the great lines of all the plays in the past. Because of
that belief they insist that the principle actor repeat Hamlet's
soliloquy in "Desire Under the Elms." Such a restatement would destroy
the play as effectively as the interruptions of the realists, and might
even make the play so dull that the audience would prefer to listen to
the realist rather than the actors. The only worthwhile critic or
director would be the one who considered the utility of any line to
produce the effect at which he consciously aimed within the limits of
the setting in which it was to be delivered.

Such a figure of speech is significant, not in depicting absolute truth
but in picturing what the writer considers to be a useful attitude in
America today. The details of legal philosophy are not so significant as
the general attitudes or approaches to problems which they induce. There
is no absolutely true approach because "in the house of jurisprudence
there are many mansions."^[^42]^ The happy phrase "relativist-realist
jurisprudence"^[^43]^ recently coined by Dean Pound is a short way of
saying that an objective examination of courts may not be so necessary
in England where appellate courts confine their observations to a few
hundred volumes as it is in America when we seek to prevent the
confusion of a yearly output of twenty-five thousand printed opinions.
We have a very practical problem before us, to make our way of judicial
expression more intelligible, and our judicial principles and ideals
more effective. The writer thinks that it can only be solved by
determining what problems may be removed from the rigid impersonal
atmosphere of substantive law and brought down into the practical
atmosphere of procedure. This is not a denial of the necessity of a
rigid philosophy of substantive law in our judicial system. It is simply
an attempt to point out that the legal scholar or critic, by centering
his attention on the judicial institution in connection with the
problems with which it is confronted, can determine which of these
problems should be treated with the attitude of substantive law, and
which with the attitude of "procedure."^[^44]^ In that way rather than
in the assumption that historical categories can only be changed by
legislatures, which do not and can not understand them, lies the way to
the clarification of our judicial expression. Without an objective
examination of the judicial institution itself, we are likely to be
trapped by our old phrases, and to feel that we must continue to use
them long after this utility has disappeared.

    The statements which follow, of course, do not attempt to be
    accurate but rather to set out a popular notion which still affects
    much legal scholarship, particularly that portion of it devoted to
    clarifying doctrine by logical analysis. An accurate general
    statement of what legal scholars are doing is, of course, impossible
    because they are doing so many things. It is, however, the writer's
    belief that the statements which follow are fairly descriptive of an
    attitude which is often instinctively taken. Subjects like torts or
    contracts are usually so separated intellectually from jurisprudence
    in textbook thought that an instinctive conventional approach is
    adopted in the former which may be denied in the latter subject.

    The perennial dispute as to whether facts and social conditions or
    doctrine should be the basis of legal study owes its continuance
    largely to the fact that when we speak of "law" we usually refer to
    all of these situations at once, without differentiation between
    them. We might add still others. For example: We often call "law"
    those protective devices which lawyers use to safeguard a client
    from all possible trouble with courts; as, for example, the long
    forms which attempt to protect a sales contract of an automobile
    from the hazards of the courts of fortyeight states. No one reads
    the form until trouble arises and then it becomes the stuff out of
    which legal arguments are made. We also refer to as "law" the ideals
    which give prestige and authority to courts. That different
    approaches are necessary in these different situations is indicated
    by Pound, The Call for a Realist Jurisprudence (1931) 44 HARV. L.
    REV. 697. A somewhat different classification, but with the same
    idea in mind, is found in Frank, Are Judges Human (1931) 80 U, OF

    "The Act provides that the Court of Criminal Appeal shall allow an

    should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot

    "Perhaps the reason why the English Lawyer is not dissatisfied with
    the present system is that the \' myriad' precedents do not exist.
    The English cases to 1865 are reprinted in the English Reports in
    about 175 volumes. The semiofficial Law Reports from 1865 to the
    present date occupy about 450 volumes. Thus 625 volumes make up a

    "Only a small proportion of the decided cases are reported each
    year; unless a case deals with a novel point of law ---and novelty
    is strictly construed --- it will rarely find its way into the
    Reports. . It is hardly surprising to find that the English lawyer
    has no difficulty in digesting the annual reports, and that he does
    not, therefore, demand a change in the established system."
    GOODHART, op. cit. supra note 28, at 57.\
    Of course English writers would deny the statement that this
    selective process is ever used as a method of avoiding inconvenient
    cases. The writer, however, believes that a selective system of
    printing cases inevitably cuts down the possibility of encumbering
    legal principles with qualifications and exceptions, even though
    this is not the conscious intent.

    "A search through the English periodicals since 1900 does not show a
    single article or note by an English lawyer in which the system has
    been adversely criticized. No modern English poet has arisen to
    denounce the English Law as Tennyson did seventy years ago:\
    'Mastering the lawless science of our law,\
    That codeless myriad of precedent,\
    That wilderness of single instances,\
    Through which a few, by wit or fortune led,\
    May beat a pathway out to wealth or fame."\
    GOODHART, op. cit. supra note 28, at 56--57. The writer contends
    that the reason the poets of today are silent is because the English
    have devised procedural escapes from the consequences of too rigid
    application of the rule of stare decisis, rather than because of any
    sudden change in the nature of English judges.

    This is becoming less true every year. Dean Pound in The Call for a
    Realistic Jurisprudence set out the need for a discussion of the
    utility of doctrine in the judicial process and also the relevancy
    of a study of the psychological factors involved. (1931) 44 HARV. L.
    Rev. 697. Leon Green, in JUDGE AND JURY (1930), emphasizes the
    function of legal doctrine in the delimitation of functions of trial
    and appellate courts and juries. Two recent articles in the Yale Law
    Journal indicate by their titles that the function of legal concepts
    instead of their logical analysis is the center of interest.

    This is illustrated by an interesting controversy over the nature of
    the code " Cause of Action." Dean Clark proposed a test which left
    the determination of the extent of the cause to the discretion of
    the court, having in mind the facts of the particular case. CLARK,
    CODE PLEADING (1928) 83. This was attacked on the ground of (1) lack
    of certainty and (2) lack of symmetry by three able scholars all of
    whom sought to define the fundamental elements of the term in the
    various dissimilar situations in which it was used. McCaskill,
    Actions and Causes of Actions (1925) 34 VALE L. J. 614; Harris, What
    is a Cause of Action (1928) 16 CALIF. L. Rev. 459; Gavit, The Code
    Cause of Action: Joinder and Counterclaims (1930) 30 COL. L. Rev.
    802. The significance of the controversy lies in the fact that in
    spite of the dialectic ability of the three last named authors
    seeking the fundamental elements of the " cause of action" they not
    only disagree with each other, but also with the earlier definitions
    of the term.

    The uniform sales act in its generalizations as to when title

    It is assumed here that if the sole purpose of instructions in
    negligence cases were to put the jury, unfamiliar with legal
    concepts, in the proper frame of mind to determine liability, and
    such instructions were not considered as accurate expressions of the
    "law of negligence" many of our elaborate definitions of negligence,
    and its qualifying doctrines, would disappear. The two questions,
    when will a court permit a jury to pass on a case, and how will the
    court talk to the jury, could be sharply distinguished in any
    formulation of negligence law which treated the question as one of
    distribution of power. See GREEN, JUDGE AND JURY (1930) 153 et seq.

    It must be apparent that the writer has used the terms "substantive
    law" and "procedure" to describe different attitudes, rather than
    the classification found in the law school curriculum. Many of the
    concepts which are ordinarily denominated "procedural" have been
    treated with the attitude of "substantive law" ough this is becoming
    less frequent. See Mc U; Harr and vit, all supra note 37.
