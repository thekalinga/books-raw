_This article discusses the Supreme Court's views on compensation as expressed in its judgment in
the Bank Nationalisation case since, in the author's view, they are the most significant part of the judgment._

_The decision of the Supreme Court in this case takes the country back to the position that obtained
before the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. It repudiates whatever was discussed and thought
proper in the Constituent Assembly and in Parliament over the last 20 years._

_By the bank nationalisation judgment, taken together with the judgment in the Golaknath case
three years ago, the Supreme Court has made virtually impossible the implementation of a policy to
which Parliament, consisting of the elected representatives of the people, is pledged._

_To permit the present decision to remain as the law of the land would mean giving the Courts a
power that would block any possibility of building a socialist economy within the framework of the
present Constitution._

The judgment of the Supreme Court
in the Bank Nationalisation case covers
a number of points and leaves a larger
number open. In particular, it upholds
the power of Parliament to legislate
for Bank Nationalisation while striking
down the Act on the grounds, first, of
discrimination and, secondly, that proper
compensation has not been paid.
In this article, I have taken for discussion
the Court's view on compensation
since I consider it to be the most
important and significant part of the
judgment.

The decision of the Supreme Court
in the Bank Nationalisation case puts
the country behind the position that
obtained at the time of the Fourth
Amendment of the Constitution. It is,
therefore, a matter of great concern to
all our people. To solve the problems
that are created by this decision is not
going to be easy.

The crux of this decision is that the
Supreme Court has laid down categorically
that "the Constitution guarantees
a right to compensation --- an equivalent
in money of the property compulsorily
acquired. That is the basic
guarantee." Elsewhere in the judgment,
the Court has observed that "the
Constitution guarantees a right to compensation
--- an equivalent of the property
appropriated."

# Debate in Constituent Assembly

To appreciate the importance of
these observations we must go back to
the time when the matter was first debated
in the Constituent Assembly in 1949.
At that time, a proposal was
put forward by KM Munshi, ultimately
one of the principal founders
of the Swatantra party. In his draft
on Fundamental Rights, he included
a clause that "no person would be
deprived of life, liberty or property
without due process of law" and that
"expropriation for public reasons only
shall be permitted ... in return for a
just and adequate consideration.
according to principles laid down by
law". At the other end of the political
spectrum was the draft of K T Shah,
which provided that the State will be
"entitled to acquire any private property
as may be permitted under the
law for the time being in force". Shah's
draft laid down that compensation
need be paid only when property held
by a religious body is taken over and
even then the amount of compensation
would be such as "may be deemed
reasonable and appropriate".

The arguments in the Constituent
Assembly on these two different and
obviously contradictory proposals were
vigorous and wide-ranging. The Constitutional
Adviser of the Assembly, BN
Rau, warned that though admittedly
a safeguard against predatory legislation
by Parliament might be necessary
it may also stand in the way of beneficent
social legislation. He suggested
the insertion of a new clause whereby
the operation of Fundamental Rights
might be limited "whenever the exigencies
of the common good so required".
K T Shah insisted that before
the policy of payment of compensation
is adopted it should take into account
that "in many cases the proprietor
would have benefited himself by
several times the value of his property".
He pointed out that this must be the
position at least in the case of developed
land or exploited mines.

# Misplaced confidence

Ultimately, the draft of Article 31
as it came before Parliament was as
follows :

>(1) No person shall be deprived of
>his property save by authority
>of law.
>(2) No property, movable or immovable,
>including any interest
>in, or in any company owning,
>any commercial or industrial
>undertaking, shall be taken
>possession of or acquired for
>public purposes under any law
>authorising the taking of such
>possession or such acquisition
>unless the law provides for the
>payment of compensation for
>the property taken possession of
>or acquired and either fixes the
>amount of the compensation or
>specifies the principles on which
>and the manner in which the
>compensation is to be determined.

Ninety-seven amendments were
moved to this draft article, again
reflecting two sharply divergent and
contradictory views. The Left insisted
that the legislature must be left completely
free to give or deny compensation
in all cases where the state took
over property for a public purpose and
that its decision in the matter must
not be open to challenge in courts.
Among the advocates of this view
were Damodar Swarup Seth, KT
Shah, Shibbanlal Saxena, H V Kamath
and Shrimati Renuka Ray. They
warned, and one must say almost
prophetically, that if clause 2 remained,
the quantum of compensation
would be justiciable in the Supreme
Court which would become the ultimate
authority to detemine its adequacy.

Opposed to them were Naziruddin
Ahmed and Jaspat Ray Kapur and
others who insisted on the principle
of just or equitable compensation. But
even Kapur had to pacify the Constituent
Assembly by emphasising that
there was no need to be afraid
of justiciability and that the judges
could be relied upon to determine
what was "equitable in accordance
with the prevailing political theories
and accepted economic principles of
the times" --- a confidence which
seems to have been singularly misplaced
as subsequent history has
shown.

# Bela Banerjee's case

The socialists were answered by
both Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer and
Govind Vallabh Pant who said that
under the draft article, the principles
of compensation laid down by the
legislature would be invulnerable in
any court, unless they amounted to a
fraud on the Constitution. Even
Munshi pointed out that the article
provided for judicial review only if
the principles provided for compensation
were illusory, or there was expropriation
in the guise of acquisition, in
other words, "a fraud on the Constitution".

After this long and often acrimonious
debate, all were satisfied that the
matter was clear. Property could not
be acquired except for a public purpose;
and the law providing for such
acquisition must fix the principles of
compensation or provide for the
amount. Such a law in respect of
compensation could be challenged in
court only if the principles were
irrelevant or the amount fixed was
illusory.

But the first attack on this understanding
of Article 31 was delivered
by the Judges of the Supreme Court
in 1956 in their judgment in what is
known as Bela Banerjee's case. In
view of the subsequent and long
controversy on the question, it is worthwhile
going back to the facts and the
decision in that case.

The issue in that case was the validity
of certain provisions of the West
Bengal Land Development and Planning
Act, 1948, which was passed
primarily for the settlement of refugees
from East Bengal. The Act, in effect,
laid down that the amount payable as
compensation for land should not
exceed the value of the land on December
31, 1946. Naturally, the argument
put forward on behalf of Bela Banerjee
was that the compensation was
clearly below market value as the
price of land had gone up after
31-12-1946. Therefore, Article 31 (2)
had been violated since the word
"compensation" must be interpreted to
mean the just equivalent of what the
owner has been deprived.

The Court laid down :

>While it
is true that the legislature is given
the discretionary power of laying
down the principles which should
govern the determination of the amount
to be given to the owner for the property
appropriated, such principles
must ensure that what is determined
as payable must be compensation, that
is, a just equivalent of what the owner
has been deprived of. Within the
limits of the basic requirement of _full
indemnification_ (emphasis mine] of
the expropriated owner, the Constitution
allows free play to the legislative
judgment as to what principles should
guide the determination of the amount
payable.

In another place the court laid down
that "any principle for determining
compensation which denies to the
owner this increment in value cannot
result in the ascertainment of the true
equivalent of the land appropriated".

# Fourth Amendment

This decision of the Supreme Court
in Bela Banerjee's case was directly
against the understanding of Article 31
arrived at in the Constituent Assembly.
For if anything was clear about this
understanding, it was that the jurisdiction
of the courts would only be
attracted if the principles of compensation
fixed by the legislature were a
fraud on the Constitution or resulted
in payment of an illusory amount. But
the Court took no notice of this view
of the Constituent Assembly. Instead,
it interpreted the word compensation
to mean "full indemnification" or "true
equivalent".

Parliament was then faced with the
position that the interpretation put on
Article 31 by the makers of the Constitution
had been rejected by the Court
and instead the Court had arrogated
to itself the jurisdiction which the
Constituent Assembly never intended
to confer upon it, namely, the jurisdiction
to decide whether or not the
market value, the just equivalent of
the property acquired, had been given
in compensation. Parliament, therefore,
passed the Fourth Amendment which
amended Article 31 (2) to read :

>No property shall be compulsorily
acquired or requisitioned save for a
public purpose and save by authority
of a law which provides for compensation
for the property so acquired
or requisitioned and either fixes
the amount of the compensation or
specifies the principles on which, and
the manner in which, the compensation
is to be determined and given;
and no such law shall be called in
question in any court on the ground
that the compensation provided by
that law is not adequate.

For the common man the meaning
of this was quite clear; namely, the
principles of compensation must be
laid down or the amount should be
fixed, but in any event, neither the
principles nor the amount shall be
challenged in court on the ground
that the compensation provided is
inadequate.

# "Just Equivalent"

The next chapter in the story of
the Court's handling of Article 31 is
expressed in two decisions. The first,
Vajrevelu Mudaliar Vs the State of
Madras (1965 I SCR 614) and the
second State of Gujarat Vs Shantilal
Mangaldas (1967 I SCR 255). By the
first decision, the Court laid down that
even after the passing of the Fourth
Amendment, the constitutional guarantee
would be satisfied only if a just
equivalent of the property was given
to the owner. At the same time, in a
somewhat contradictory passage, it also
held that if one of the items that go
to make the full value of the property
(in that case the potential and future
value of the property was in issue)
was ignored in computing the amount
of compensation or in laying down the
principles for such a computation, the
Court would not strike down the law
merely on this ground. Thus, in Vajrevelu
Mudaliar's case while the Court
held that the constitutional guarantee
would be satisfied only if the just
equivalent of the property was given
to the owner, in a sense it went back
on this statement by laying down that
one of the elements that go to make
up the total amount of compensation
may be ignored and such a failure to
take into consideration the element
would not lead to the law being struck
down.

In Shantilal Mangaldas's case,
however, the Court held that the
statement of the law in Vajrevelu
Mudaliar's case that the just equivalent
must be paid as compensation was
not correct. The Court observed :

>Whatever may have been the meaning
of the expression 'compensation'
under the unamended Article 31 (2),
when the Parliament has expressly
indicated in the amended clause that
'no such law shall be called in
question in any court on the ground
that the compensation provided by
that law is not adequate', it was
intended clearly to exclude from the
jurisdiction of the court an enquiry
that what is fixed or determined by
the application of the principles
specified as compensation does not
award to the owner a just equivalent
of what he is deprived.

Moreover, Shantilal Mangaldas's case
also expressly overruled a decision of
the Court in the Metal Corporation
case where compensation based on the
depreciated value of machinery had
been struck down on the ground that
it did not provide the "just equivalent".
Thus after this decision, for the first
time the law laid down by the Supreme
Court appeared to be in accord with
the approach and understanding,
first, of the Constituent Assembly and,
secondly, of Parliament.

# Slide-back

But in the Bank Nationalisation
case, it was just this view that was
once again challenged. And the
response to this challenge takes us to
the position as it stood in Bela Banerjee's
case. The judgment harks back
to the view that the word compensation
guarantees payment uf "the
equivalent in money", as it is observed
in one place in the judgment; and "the
equivalent of the property expropriated",
as it is observed in another part
of the judgment. Thus, shorn of all
the lengthy discussion in the judgment,
we are taken back to the position that
the word "compensation" is the equi.
valent in money value of the property
that has been acquired by the state.
The Court, of course, pays lip-service
tu the words in Article 31 (2) that it
is not entitled to go into the question
of inadequacy of compensation. But
then, once it has interpreted the word
"compensation" as "the just equivalent"
or "the equivalent in money" of the
value of the property, and is prepared
to examine whether the principles of
compensation laid down by the legislature
do or do not lead to the payment
of an amount which is the money
equivalent of the property expropriated,
then what else is needed to enable
the judges to go into the adequacy or
inadequacy of the amount of compensation?

The Court observes :

>We are unable to hold that the
principle specified by the Parliament
for determining compensation of the
property to be acquired is conclusive.
If that view had to be accepted,
then Parliament will be invested
with a character of arbitrariness and
by abuse of legislative process, the
Constitutional guarantee of the right
to compensation may be severely
impaired.

It is, of course, very salutary that the
Court should be so concerned about
the possibility of "arbitrariness" of Parliament.
But is that any ground for
departing from the understanding of
Shantilal's case that the protection of
the Court in cases of illusory or fraudulent
compensation is enough to safeguard
the citizen from possible "arbitrariness"
of Parliament?

Raising high the banner of defending
the citizen's right, the Court has
opined:

>The broad object underlying the
principle of valuation is to award to
the owner the equivalent of his property
with its existing advantages
and its potentialities. Where there
is an established market for the property
acquired, the problem of valuation
presents little difficulty. Where
there is no established market for
the property, the object of the
principle of valuation must be
to pay to the owner for what he
has lost, including the benefit of
advantages present as well as future,
without taking into account the
urgency of acquisition, the disinclination
of the owner to part with the
property, and the benefit which the
acquirer is likely to obtain by the
acquisition.

What else does this mean than that
any principle of compensation will be
considered irrelevant (or illusory) unless
that principle is one which leads to the
conclusion that the owner of the expropriated
property has been paid the
money equivalent of his property?

# Extraordinary Principle

In its judgment, the Court has laid
down six important methods for determination
of compensation: first, the
market value, determined from sale
value of comparable property; second,
capitalisation of the net annual value
of property; third, if the property is a
house, expenditure likely to be incurred
in constructing a similar house; fourth,
the principle of reinstatement, that is,
where the owner of the property is reinstated
in some other place and the
compensation will be assessed on the
basis of the reasonable cost of reinstatement;
fifth, when the property has
outgrown its utility and economic use,
land plus the break-up value of
the structures; and sixth, when the property
acquired has to be valued
as a unit, the aggregate of the value of
different assets of a company will not
necessarily be the value of the company.
The Court observes that these are
not the only methods, and the substance
of the observation of the Court
is that it will sit in judgment on whatever
principle that is laid down, from
the point of view of whether or not
the application of the principle leads
ultimately to the money equivalent of
the property.

These propositions repudiate whatever
was discussed and thought proper in the
Constituent Assembly and in Parliament
over the last 20 years. Moreover, in
this judgment, the Court has gone
back even beyond Bela Banerjee's case.
Here is the passage that is of crucial
importance:

>But in judging whether the law
provides for compensation, the
money value at the date of expropriation
of what is given as compensation,
must be considered. If the
rate of interest compared with the
ruling commercial rate is low, it will
reduce the present value of the bond.
The Constitution guarantees a right
to compensation---an equivalent of
the property expropriated and the
right to compensation cannot be
converted into a loan on terms which
do not fairly compare with the prevailing
commercial terms. If the
statute in providing for compensation
devises a scheme for payment of
compensation by giving it in the form
of bonds, and the present value of
what is determined to be given is
thereby substantially reduced, the
statute impairs the guarantee of compensation.

The Supreme Court has now given
the charter to the courts to sit in
judgment on any securities which are
given as compensation and decide whether
the compensation is on terms which
clearly compare with the prevailing
"commercial" terms.

In another place, the Court observes :

>We need only observe that by
giving to the expropriated owner
compensation in bonds of the facevalue
of the amount determined
maturing after many years and carrying
a certain rate of interest, the
constitutional guarantee is not necessarily
complied with. If the market
value of the bonds is not approximately
equal to the face-value, the
expropriated owner may raise a grievance
that the guarantee under Article
31(2) is impaired.

Thus the Court has categorically
pronounced that when bonds or secuirities
are given, the Parliament must
take into account the rise in prices and,
therefore, the reduction in the value of
money. Till the judgment in the
Bank Nationalisation case, no court has
tried to put forward such an extraordinary
principle, which means that
the compensation when ultimately paid,
say, ten or twenty years hence, must
take into account also the rise in prices
and therefore, the reduction in value
of money.

# Parliament Thwarted

The Supreme Court's judgment
entirely rules out the approach suggested
by K T Shah and other members in
the Constituent Assembly. Shah wanted
that Parliament should be entitled
to take into consideration how the property
was utilised during the years
when the property was in the possession
of the owner. A simple instance
is the case of plantations where enormous
profits have been made by their
owners, exceeding many, many times
the capital value of the property. Are
they also to be paid the full value of the
property, not taking into account whether
in the meantime the proprietor nas
benefited by several times the value of
the property?

The Directive Principles enjoin upon
our people to secure that "the operation
of the economic system does not
result in the concentration of wealth
and means of production to the common
detriment" (Article 39). How is
the State to work to reduce the enormous
wealth in the hands of a few
individuals except by taking over and
expropriating those areas of property
which are being utilised in such a way
as go against the common good? Yet
if full market value compensation has
to be paid for every such action by the
State, in effect the "concentration of
wealth" will remain the same.

So long as this judgment of the
Supreme Court stands as the law of
our land, it will undoubtedly be the
biggest block in any attempt to take the
country forward towards the democratic
and socialist order which our millions
are pledged to achieve.

Three years ago, in Golaknath's case
the Supreme Court laid down that the
chapter on Fundamental Rights (Part III
of the Constitution in which is also
placed Article 31) could not be amended
by Parliament. The result is that
after this judgment, Parliament is
powerless to change the Constitution
so as to achieve what the Constituent
Assembly in 1949 and Parliament in
1956 wished to achieve. Thus the
Supreme Court through its judgment in
these two cases, namely, Golaknath's
case and Rustom Cooper's case has
made impossible the implementation of
a policy to which Parliament, consisting
of the elected representatives of the
people, is entirely pledged. In effect,
repeatedly the intentions of elected representatives
of the people, assembled
in Parliament, have been defeated by
the judgments of the Court. And to
cap this, the Court also lays down that
Parliament cannot amend the Constitution
so as to achieve its aim. This is
a most extraordinary position for any
people to face. It puts on the agenda
of our people as the most urgent item,
the question of refashioning or amending
our Constitution so as to change
Article 31 to bring it in line with what
was the original objective of the founding-fathers.

# Tinkering will not do

It may well be asked whether any
tinkering with Article 31 could achieve
the purpose sought to be achieved by
the Constituent Assembly and the
Fourth Amendment. After the experience
of the Supreme Court over the
last 20 years, I think we can legitimately
come to the conclusion that no
amendment can take the country towards
the objective which it wants to
attain and the only way to achieve
that objective would be to take Article
31 out of the Constitution and make
the only limitation on the State's power
to acquire property for a public purpose
that it must be by means of a law
made by Parliament. The substance of
this proposal is that we should be prepared
to give to Parliament the power
to decide when property needs to be
acquired in the interests of society and
whether and what compensation should
be paid when property is thus acquired.
After all, it is our people who must
decide about the road of progress along
which they wish to tread. And this
they do through their elected representatives
in Parliament. There is no
reason for us to be afraid of giving
this power to Parliament because Parliament
is elected by the people. But
to permit the present decision of the
Supreme Court to remain as the law of
the land would mean giving the Courts
a power that would block any possibility
of building a socialist economy within
the framework of the present Constitution.
It would compel any sincere and
devoted adherent of socialism to decide
that to work for the establishment of
socialism in India involves workng outside
the Constitution and in defiance of
it, as the Courts by their judicial pronouncements
have made impossible the
use of this Constitution for the achievement
of a socialist order.
