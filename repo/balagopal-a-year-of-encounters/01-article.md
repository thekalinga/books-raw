_For the last two decades it is the myth of democracy vs
dictatorship that has constituted the ideology through which the
ruling classes of India have conducted their internal squabbles. In
fact, as the squabbling increases the conflict has less and less to
do with democracy, though we hear more and more talk about it.
It seems to be a law of political behaviour that the more ruling
classes quarrel among themselves the less regard they can afford
to show for people's rights._

That N T Rama Rao should be nominated
the first democrat of the nation --- for that
is what one presumes his selection as the
chairman of the _National Front_ makes
him --- during the very year in which his
government's record of 'encounter' killings
has surpassed that of even the Emergency
days, would perhaps be regarded as a
shameful paradox in any country other than
ours: for have we not been blissfully
tolerating as prime minister a man whose
probity is in doubt --- and whose respect for
truth is not even in doubt --- for more than
a year after the allegations against him first
crossed the dividing line between rumour
and certainty?

And yet the record must be stated,
especially because of the widespread
hypocrisy that prevents people from talking
of the atrocities and the misrule of the
opposition parties. There is prevalent in this
country this unverified myth of a democratic
opposition, that is projected as an alternative
to the authoritarian misrule of Rajiv
Gandhi's _Cong(I)_. Not just today, but for
the last two decades it is the myth of
democracy vs authoritarianism --- _dharma_ vs
_adharma_ as the more _desi_ of our politicians
put it --- that has constituted the ideology
through which the ruling classes of India
have fought their internal squabbles. This is
the ideology with which first Indira Gandhi
and then Rajiv Gandhi were fought at the
centre, and NTR himself faces it each time
a dissident faction springs up within his
own party. This is not to say that these
individuals were not --- and are not --- undemocratic,
nor that this way of projecting
the conflict does not reflect a certain desire
for greater democracy on the part of the
people: indeed, but for the presence of such
an aspiration, such a projection would never
have become necessary in the first place. But
as far as the protagonists are concerned, that
is not the point at all. As the squabbling
increases, the conflict has less and less to do
with democracy but we hear more and more
talk about it. Indeed, the very fact that the
squabbling is increasing makes all of
them --- rulers and the opposition --- further
undemocratic. It is a law of political
behaviour that the more the ruling classes
quarrel among themselves the less regard
they can afford to show for people's rights,

NTR's appointed task was to gain acceptability
as the common representative of all
sections of the propertied classes of Andhra
Pradesh in their conflict with big capital over
the terms of the resolution of the current
crisis in the redefinition of the economic
structure, and --- concomitantly --- in the
sharing of the country's natural resources
and the surplus pumped out of the working
masses. In this he has been a miserable
failure from the word go. To begin with there
has always been a section within the regional
rich who have held --- and hold --- that the
problem can be sorted out and a smooth
restructuring achieved, within the superstructure
built over the last four decades;
politically, that is to say within the Congress
Party, celebrated as an all-class party by admiring
analysts. Not being able to carry
these sections need not be counted as a
failure, but NTR's true failure lies in his
inability to carry with him even all of those
who believe that a certain degree of confrontation
with the superstructure is necessary
if their interests are to be safeguarded in the
alignment that is to take shape. Instead, he
is seen as merely a gangleader who is bent
on getting the most that is possible for his
henchmen. Disenchantment with him started
within a year of his coming to power and
it continues to grow apace. In the given
ideological idiom, it takes the form of
accusations of _casteism_. People who openly
rally in the name of one caste accuse him
of being partial to the _kamma_ caste. Since
the well-to-do among the _kammas_ are
numerous and very rich the charge sticks
easily. But on the other side of the coin, it
is only where the caste that is the focal
counterpoint of the opposition carries with
it an image of toil and hard work that the
exercise carries a degree of credibility. Those
who tried to rally in the name of the _Reddys_
had a difficult time. The most humorous
part of Dronamraju Satyanarayana's widely
reported _writ petition_ in the AP High Court
was his ridiculous plea that the _Reddys_ are
being oppressed in NTR's rule. And when
N Sreenivasulu Reddy --- once upon a time a
servile admirer of NTR --- found himself
being humiliated and demoted from his
status as number two in the cabinet and
turned dissident and was forced to leave the
cabinet, he had no takers for his plaint that
the _Reddys_ --- he is a _Reddy_ from Nellore
district --- are getting an unjust deal, since the
landlords, contractors and businessmen of
his caste and his district are among the most
powerful and influential persons in the state.
And so he had to hold his tongue and beat
an ignominious retreat to the Congress(I),
which has, incidentally, nominated another
_Reddy_ from Nellore as its PCC(I) president.

But the latest phenomenon, Mudragada
Padmanabham --- yet one more 'clean' dissident --- has
had an easier time rallying in
the name of the _kapus_. The word _kapu_ has
many meanings. Etymologically it means
husbandsman, a meaning that comes out
clearly when landlords say 'our _kapus_' referring
to their farm servants or attached
peasants. The feudal attachment is made
explicit when the term _paali kapu_ is used to
refer to attached labour. But when an
independent cultivator proudly describes
himself as a _kapu_ it merely denotes a hardworking
cultivator without connotations of
servitude or attachment. _Kapu_ is further a
caste name as in _Toorpu kapu_, _Munnur
kapu_, or just _kapu_; and finally it is a common
appellation for these and a number of
other castes like _Balija_, _Telaga_, _Tenuga_,
_Mudiraj_, etc, whose occupation --- the
statistical mode --- is cultivation, though there
are quite a few labourers at one end and big
landholders and businessmen at the other,
Thus the caste is an ideal candidate for
populist consolidation. A cinema hall
and rice mill owner like Mudragada
Padmanabham, a publisher and film-maker
like Dasari Narayana Rao and a mafia
gangster like Vangaveeti Mohana Ranga
Rao, _Cong(I)_ MLA from Vijayawada, whose
_forte_ is the out-of-court settlement of
disputes concerning finance and property
through threats --- and perpetuation --- of
physical violence, find it easy to talk of
injustice done to the _kapu_ castes under
NTR's rule and to rally people behind them
in the name of the _kapu_ caste-complex.[^1] And
these are not just three individuals but
representatives of a sizeable class of the
upper cream of the castes from coastal
Andhra. Whether they can gloss over for
long the fact that they have been addressing
only the forward caste _kapus_ of the Krishna
and Godavari deltas, and that too mainly the
Godavari delta where over a large area it is
the _kapu_ landholders, businessmen and contractors
who constitute the dominant class,
and that the backward caste _kapus_ who are
numerous in the Telangana districts are
neither addressed nor affected by their rallying
cry, and are even likely to be hostile since
their major demand is that the forward caste
_kapus_ must be notified as backward, is a
moot point. But what is more relevant is that
such consolidations would never have taken
place had NTR risen to his task, which he
has never shown any capacity to do.

[^1]: This report was written before Mohana Ranga
  Rao's murder in Vijayawada on December 26.

It may be said that the failure lies in the
objective situation and not in NTR's incompetence.
Indeed, that may be said of
Rajiv Gandhi too, who is being attacked with
such viciousness not because he is corrupt
but because he is incompetent. Had his competence
in serving the necessary interests
been higher his corruption would not have
mattered so much. The new national consensus
that everybody is hoping for is no
where in sight and nobody has an inkling
how to set about discovering it, and they are
all, understandably, angry with the young
leader on whom so many hopes rested three
years ago. He, for his part, has made the
happy discovery that the economy has
carved out for itself a path of least resistance
suited to the logic of its structure and all that
he needs to do is to prod it along a little by
liberalising procedures here and there. His
enemies are not really against this, but they
only want much more of a systematic
restructuring and the writing of new equations
to take place; and they are wild with
him for not taking the task seriously. NTR's
failure is on par. Those who made him and
brought him to power wanted him to lead
the regional elite to a position of strength
in the new alignment; but instead of offering
such a creative and collective leadership he
is content to concentrate on the shortsighted
enrichment of those who are close to him
and his sons-in-law, with no thought for the
"collective interest". He uses the administration
to serve the interests of his faction and encourages
them to indulge in unseemly conflicts
and bloodshed against the people as
well as their rivals. Instead of the singleminded
Telugu nationalism that his promoters
promised, what has resulted from
five years of NTR's rule is a fractious and
violent polity. In a regime that speaks the
regional idiom the region is torn by the
internecine conflicts of the elite, and their
violence against the poor. A regime that
seeks to make as much wealth as possible
and as fast as possible for its faction
can only be vicious towards the masses.
And where the masses are of such political
temperament that they do not offer themselves
meekly for oppression and exploitation,
the result can be extremely violent.

On August 23, 1988 a youth by name
Sathu Madhu who ran a _kangan_ shop in
Warangal town was asked by the police to
report at a local police station. He had had
a past as a 'radical' but had given up active
politics and was leading the life of a petty
shopkeeper. The police, it seemed, wanted
to only question him and send him home;
or at least that is what the youth told his
mother before leaving home for the police
station. When he did not come back immediately,
his mother got apprehensive and
met the superintendent of police to ask him
about her son's whereabouts. He replied: 'by
the evening your son will come home, or if
not, then tomorrow his dead body will come
home'. The police killed him that night,
whether in the process of 'questioning' him
or in fulfilment of their quota of 'encounter'
killings, one does not know, and announced
to the press the next day that there had been
an 'encounter' near Warangal town and an
unidentified _naxalite_ was killed.

Golla Devaiah(23) and Potarala Bhoomaiah
(27) were two peasants of Karimnagar
district. The former belonged to Govindaram
and the latter to Mothukurraopet. They were
sympathisers of the _Rytu Coolie Sangham_ (translates to Association of Farmer & Farm helpers),
and had in the past been arrested and implicated
in false criminal cases. They were
regularly attending court in those cases, and
were otherwise living in their villages, looking
after their cultivation. On July 10, the
police picked them up from Govindaram,
took them outside the village, and shot them
dead. It was announced to the press that a
group of armed _naxalites_ attacked the police
and the police returned fire, resulting in the
death of two unidentified _naxalites_.

During the night of October 29, the police
of Nizamabad district said, they confronted
an armed group of _naxalites_ in the village
of Korpol, where the _naxalites_ were allegedly
campaigning for reduction in the price of
country-liquor. There was, the police said,
an exchange of fire, in which one unidentified
_naxalite_ died and a constable was
injured. What really happened was that in
the exchange of fire that took place outside
the village, no one died but one constable
was injured. The police searched fruitlessly
for the _naxalites_ for a while, and unable to
find them, came back to the village in an
ugly mood, caught hold of a _harijan_ peasant
by name Lachchaiah who was known
to be a sympathiser of the _naxalites_, took
him out of the village and killed him, He
was the 'unidentified' _naxalite_.

The police of Karimnagar district said
that on September 14, an 'encounter' took
place in a mango grove near the village of
Raghavapuram, in which a _naxalite_ by name
Rangula Sambaiah was killed. In fact,
Sambaiah was not a party activist; he was a
peasant who sympathised with the _naxalites_.
The police tried to arrest him and implicate
him in some crime. To avoid the torture that
would be an inevitable concomitant of it,
Sambaiah left his village and sought shelter
in the house of some relatives of his at
Mandamarri, Adilabad district. The police
caught hold of his relatives in his native
village and tortured them to reveal the
whereabouts of Sambaiah. They did, and the
police caught hold of him, killed him for the
trouble he had given them, and threw the
dead body near the mango grove outside his
village, and proclaimed to those who would
believe that there had been an 'encounter'.

On October 14 the police of Warangal
district are supposed to have received information
about some _naxalites_ holding a
meeting with tribals in the village of
Muthapur in the Eturnagaram forest region.
They went to the place, they said, and asked
the _naxalites_ to come out of the house in
which they had gathered. Instead of obeying,
the _naxalites_ fired upon the police from the
house; the police returned fire (into the
house, one presumes) and killed two
_naxalites_, a man and a woman. However, the
next day an amended version is announced,
declaring that the woman was not a _naxalite_,
but a tribal by name Vanka Lakshmi. What
really happened was that the police, on
receiving the information, came to the house
where the gathering was taking place, and
straightaway opened fire at the youth who
was standing sentry outside. The machine
gun fire not only killed him, but hit the tribal
woman Vanka Lakshmi in the back of her
head. She was neither a _naxalite_ nor a part
of the gathering that was taking place in the
house. She was merely walking down the
road, away from the house, when the bullets
coming from behind caught her unawares.

On October 29, at about noon, a gathering
of tribals, forest officials, and _naxalite_
activists, who were thrashing out issues connected
with illegal cultivation in the forests,
was attacked by the police. The place was
Ravulapadu in East Godavari district. About
120 tribals from neighbouring villages and
8 officials were present there. The police
party led by the DSP of Rampachodavaram
and consisting of about 25 CRPF jawans,
fired with automatic weapons at the _naxalite_
activists. Mangaraju alias Suranna, a tribal
activist, was killed immediately and Seeta
was injured severely. She died two weeks later
in hospital. So indiscriminate was the police
firing that they injured a forest ranger, A
Suryanarayana Raju, who was hospitalised
for a long time.

In the early hours of November 20 the
Warangal police is supposed to have 'encountered'
an armed group of _naxalites_ at
Jaggannagudem, and killed three of them,
two women and a man. The women were
Poolamma and Jayamma and the man was
Sambi Reddy. This killing has perhaps
shocked the state more than any other incident.
For, Poolamma was known to and loved
by the people of the Eturnagaram forest
region for more than a decade as a dedicated
_Rytu Coolie Sangham_ leader. Affectionately
called '_Arunakka_' (translates to Aruna sister) by the masses, she led their
democratic struggles for wages and land. It
was under her leadership that the wages for
agricultural labour had increased from Rs 5
for men and Rs 3 for women to about Rs 15
to 20 per day; and the wages for picking
beedi leaf had also increased from 10 paise
per bundle to 26 paise per bundle. She was
a familiar figure to the revenue officials whom
she whould frequently approach with demands
relating to land _pattas_. And she was eqally
familiar to the police whom she would
directly approach every time any of her
activists or the people were arrested. That
such a person could be murdered by NTR's
police is an indication of the depths to which
the regime has sunk.

What really happened was that on the
morning of November 20, Poolamma, along
with 19-year-old Jayamma and Sambi
Reddy, was seen leaving the village of
Jaggannagudem. A gathering of her party's
activists had apparently been taking place
at some spot outside the village. The police
must have got wind of this, and they
followed Poolamma and her companions.
They reached the place where the gathering
was taking place and opened fire on the activists.
Most of them escaped, but Poolamma
and the two who were with her stopped and
told the police that they were prepared to get
arrested. But the police would not pay heed.
There was a long argument, at the end of
which the police beat up all three of them
and shot them dead.

But perhaps the really worst incidents
have been occurring in Adilabad district.
Here it is youth of the Gond and other tribes
who are being picked up from their villages
and killed in cold blood. This year 54 persons
have been killed in 'encounters' in
Andhra Pradesh; of these 54, while about
13 are activists of CPI-ML groups, the rest
are peasants, youth and students; 17 of these
are tribals, mostly Gonds from Adilabad
district. Their killing is part of a deliberate
strategy of terrorisation through which the
state hopes to strike at the roots of CPI-ML
movement.

Here are a few of the stories: During the
annual Nagoba festival of the Gonds, which
usually falls in the month of January, the
police picked up three Gond youth. After
about two weeks of torture, two of them
were killed on January 28 and the third person
on February 4. Both the killings were
announced as that 'unidentified _naxalites_'
killed in an 'encounter'. On October 16 the
police picked up a Gond youth by name
Rajaram from the fields where he was working.
His mother Rajubai, who later revealed
the fact, was witness to the arrest. Two days
later, Rajaram was killed and it was announced
that there had been an 'encounter'
near Kuptighat and an 'unidentified _naxalite_'
was killed. The same was the story of
Madavi Somu, who was also picked up from
his village and killed and proclaimed as an
'unidentified _naxalite_' killed in an 'encounter'
at Chintaguda on October 3. The
reason why so many of the victims have to
be described as 'unidentified _naxalites_' is
precisely that they are not _naxalite_ cadre: if
their identity is revealed, that fact will come
out.
