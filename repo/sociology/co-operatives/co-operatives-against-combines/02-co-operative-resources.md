# CO-OPERATIVE RESOURCES

The Co-operative Movement has great resources, which enable it to plan
the extension of its organisation and activities with confidence that its
plans will be carried out.

>It has, in the first place, the great network of shops and stores,
>owned by 1,058 retail societies, supplying the needs of nine
>million members and their families, to a total value of
>£350,000,000 a year.
>
>It has some three hundred productive undertakings, as well
>as farms with over 50,000 acres of agricultural land.
>
>It has its Wholesale organisations, Building and Insurance
>Societies, and its Bank.
>
>It employs about 337,000 workers in all its enterprises.
>
>In the smaller societies as well as in the larger, among the
>elected members of voluntary management committees as well
>as among its paid employees, and in the membership of its
>auxiliary organisations, it has many thousands of able and
>experienced individuals whose loyal work has helped to make the
>Movement successful and to establish its influence and prestige.

Such are, in brief outline, the principal resources of the Movement, and
they are of very great significance.

These undertakings and the already established turnover of trade do
not mean that there is no need or no opportunity for expansion. The
contrary is the case. It is estimated that Co-operative retail trade
amounts to little more than one-tenth of the total retail trade of the
country, while nearly three-tenths is in the hands of the Combines and
chain stores. Co-operative production contributes only one-seventh to
the wholesale value of the goods handled by Co-operative distribution.

There is therefore almost unlimited opportunity for expansion, especially
in a period of great social progress. The raising of the standard of living
of the people means that a great increase is necessary in the supply and
distribution of all kinds of goods and services such as the Co-operative
Movement is well able to provide.

The financial resources needed for rapid development are already in the
hands of the Movement.

The total capital invested in the Movement (shares, loans and deposits)
in 1942 amounted to nearly £420,000,000, and Reserve Funds to £82
millions.

The consolidated Balance Sheet for the Retail Distributive Societies
of Great Britain and Ireland published in the 1942 statistics presented to
the Edinburgh Congress in June, 1943, gives the following figures (in
round millions) :---

+-----------------------------------------------+-----------+
|                                               | Million £ |
+===============================================+==========:+
| Share Capital                                 | 179       |
+-----------------------------------------------+-----------+
| Reserve and Insurance Funds                   | 17        |
+-----------------------------------------------+-----------+
| Loans, Savings Bank Deposits and sundry funds | 51        |
+-----------------------------------------------+-----------+
|                                               | 247       |
+-----------------------------------------------+-----------+

How is this used ? The figures show :---

+----------------------------+----:+
| Property used in trade     | 49  |
+----------------------------+-----+
| Stocks                     | 28  |
+----------------------------+-----+
| Property not used in trade | 4   |
+----------------------------+-----+
| Investments                | 170 |
+----------------------------+-----+

While some part of the investments is in Co-operative concerns, practically
two-thirds of the available capital resources is invested outside
the Movement.

If a similar calculation is made from figures including the two wholesale
societies and the special societies, we find much the same general picture.
The Co-operative Insurance Society occupies fourth position amongst
industrial life offices. Its premium income in 1943 was nearly £12 millions,
and its assets now amount to over £51 millions.

It is clear that the Co-operative Movement has very substantial financial
resources not employed in co-operative undertakings. Many of the
societies have invested quite big sums in Government and other loans.
It is reasonable to assume that the Movement has certainly not less than
£200 millions held outside the Movement itself. By contrast, only
slightly more than £100 millions are used in the whole Movement for
stocks, land, buildings and fixtures used in trade.

The use of its accumulated financial resources for the purpose of rapidly
expanding Co-operative business is to-day necessary, not only to enable
the Movement to keep pace with the growth and vitality of other sections
of the Labour Movement, but to carry forward the fight against the
Combines and to win for Co-operation an even stronger position in the
country's economic life.
