# INTRODUCTION

It is now a hundred years since the flannel weavers of
Rochdale opened their Co-operative store, which was
to serve as the inspiration and model for the growth
of the vast Co-operative Movement of to-day.

In their hundred years of growth Co-operative Societies
have entered almost every field of economic activity
--- retail and wholesale trade, production, foreign trade,
printing and publishing, housing, insurance, banking and
shipping. The Movement has a magnificent record of
efficient organisation and service to the people. It has
played its part in every great issue which has faced the
working class, within Britain and abroad.

In this Centenary year, the British Co-operative Movement is concerned
to make its contribution to the national effort and to speed the defeat of
Fascism, which will restore freedom to Europe and lift the burden of war
from the British people. It is also concerned to make its contribution
to the future.

The goal of those who founded the Co-operative Movement was to win
for the British people a new order of society. While defending the
interests of working people as consumers, the Co-operative Movement
has more and more closely associated itself with the other wings of the
Labour Movement, the Trade Unions and the Labour Party, and made
common cause with these against the exploiting class.

With the growth of privately owned monopolies in production and
distribution, the role of the Co-operative Movement in the working-class
struggle against exploitation has grown more and more important. The
great Co-operative organisations of to-day represent a powerful check to
the operations of the Combines in the field of trade and distribution, as
well as a political force that, alongside the Trade Unions and working-class
political parties, helps to rally the people for democratic and social
progress.

At the opening of its second hundred years the Co-operative Movement
has a great new opportunity.

The strengthening of democratic and progressive opinion that has
taken place in the course of the fight against Fascism gives all sections of
the Labour Movement new possibilities of growth. The Co-operative
Movement, with its great accumulated resources, is in an exceptionally
favourable position for rapid development. The Beaverbrook campaign
against it shows that the Combines will do everything in their power,
by economic and political action, to prevent the growth of the Co-operative
Movement, which they recognise as a menace to their vested right to exploit
the workers and destroy the independence of the small trader and manufacturer.

The Co-operative Movement faces this challenge with confidence, and
will have the support of the whole Labour Movement in its fight against
the Combines.

What is at stake is not only the growth of a business organisation
protecting the workers as consumers from the greed of the Combines, but
the spreading of the democratic collective spirit of co-operation which is
of the utmost value to the people in their fight for progress and for a new
order of society. That is why the Co-operative Movement, side by side
with its business organisation, has developed social, educational and
political activities, and associated itself with every progressive cause in
Britain and abroad.

>With the defeat of Fascism, the people of Britain will be
determined to carry forward the fight against reaction, to
end the Tory domination of home and foreign policy that
has been so disastrous to the country, and to build up their
own democratic organisations to win a better and fuller life
for themselves and their children. A bold policy of expansion
and activity will enable the Co-operative Movement to take
full advantage of this favourable situation, and to play an
increasingly important part in the life of the nation.

It is in this spirit that the active membership of the Co-operative
Movement and its responsible elected leaders are now approaching the
problems of the further growth and work of the Co-operatives in the years
that follow the war. The Communist Party puts forward this statement
as a contribution to the discussion now in progress, which is of such
importance not only to the nine million co-operators and their families, but
to the whole British people.
