# SOME CO-OPERATIVE PROBLEMS

As Co-operative Societies grew in size, and began to handle a greater
variety of goods and to offer new services to their members, many problems
of organisation arose. Within each Society these are examined and
are continuously being settled, with the aim of securing the greatest
efficiency and the best possible service to the members. In the various
types of joint organisation that have been set up, the principle of Cooperative
membership has been maintained, through shareholding and
voting rights held by the individual Societies. In spite of the complex
structure of the Movement, this principle has guaranteed its essential
democratic character, and although new problems of organisation are
constantly arising, the different views held as to their practical solution do
not weaken the unity and strength of the Movement.

There are, however, certain problems of a general character which
the growth of the Movement and of the Labour Movement as a whole,
as well as the new situation which peace will bring, make ripe for discussion.

## Amalgamations and Co-ordination

The most widespread problem before the Movement from the standpoint
of efficient organisation is the existence of a large number of
relatively small Societies. There are 889 Societies out of the total of
1,065 with less than ten thousand members each. In some cases, where
Societies are larger (with twenty to forty thousand members each), there
are several such Societies in a single large town.

It is generally agreed that in many cases the amalgamation of small
and medium sized Societies covering adjacent districts would be beneficial,
enabling the amalgamated Society to undertake new services, open new
shops and expand in many directions where the separate Societies are
unable to develop. In fact, amalgamations have constantly been carried
through, especially in the larger centres of population; and there is no
doubt that these have given added strength to the Movement.

On the other hand, each separate Society, built up by members living
in a small area, tends towards preserving its independent status and
carrying on with its established membership and range of services, without
considering the benefits which amalgamation with neighbouring Societies
could bring. These tendencies are reinforced by differences in financial
position and dividend policy as between the Societies concerned.

Nevertheless, we believe that amalgamations should be encouraged,
wherever the conditions are such that practical benefits would result.
In this connection we would stress particularly the need for consideration
of amalgamations where there are two or more Societies in a single town,
or in adjacent rural areas, where the pooling of resources can lead to
immediate developments.

In some cases, where amalgamation is not immediately practicable, we
believe that the formation by neighbouring Societies of District Societies
for special services, on the lines proposed by Mr. Palmer, should be
encouraged. In some cases, federal organisation of a service might be more
suitable.

On the productive side of the Movement, there are also problems of
co-ordinating the work of the Wholesale and the Productive Societies
with those of undertakings of the same kind owned and run by Consumers'
Societies. We feel that it would be a mistake to advocate any rigid
unification of productive undertakings by taking them all out of the
hands of Societies which at present organise them. It is true that certain
advantages would result from a single management for each type of
production all over the country; on the other hand, it may be possible
to get many of these advantages without cutting across the initiative
and interest of Societies which have set up their own ventures.

The principal advantage of unification is the greater possibility of
planning on a national scale. But this could be achieved without actual
centralised ownership and management. The total needs of all Societies
for a particular product could be recorded by a central body. Orders could
then be allocated to the productive undertakings on a planned basis, so as
to get the advantages of specialised production.

In all these problems of organisation we feel that the solution of most
advantage to the Movement as a whole is not necessarily along the lines
of a complete unification under a single control. Regard has to be had
not only to the theoretical efficiency of single control, but also to the need
to maintain and encourage initiative and not to cut across actual developments
that are taking place.

## Co-operative Democracy

Co-operative organisations are based on members' shares, and the
equal right of every shareholder to participate in the election of the
management Committee and the principal other Committees through
which the work of the Society is carried on. This participation in control
carries with it the right to initiate proposals, to share in decisions on policy
and to take part in controlling activities.

So long as the Societies were small and covered a small area, the
members were effectively drawn into democratic participation in their
activities. This is still generally true of the smaller Societies (there are
307 Societies with an average membership of only 493). But 60 percent
of the total membership of the Movement is now organised in 96 Societies
each having over twenty thousand members. Six Societies have over
100,000 members each, including the giant London Co-operative Society
with over 800,000 members.

The growth in size of the Societies has been of enormous benefit to
their members and to the Movement. Amalgamations have made it
possible to pool resources, increase the number of shops and departmental
stores, and undertake services which the separate Societies could not
have started. The policy of amalgamation is one which will rightly be
carried further.

But it is true that the increase in size of so many Societies has led in
practice to a loss of contact between members and the affairs of their
Society. The formal rights of participation in control and in shaping
policy remain; but in the larger Societies they are exercised by only a
tiny proportion of the membership. This is a serious problem for the
Movement, not because the elected management committees and the
appointed officials are failing to give of their best, but because the members
tend to lose interest in the affairs of their Society, and their loyalty to it
and to Co-operative principles tends to grow weaker.

The problem is a difficult one, because its solution depends not only
on the existence of democratic machinery (which is still in the larger
Societies much the same as in the smaller ones), but on rousing the
interest of the members and also on winning management committees
and officials to appreciate the need for more active participation by the
members.

The work of the Political and Education Committees, in Societies
where these exist, and the work of the auxiliary organisations --- the Guilds
and Parties --- helps to maintain interest in Co-operative affairs in general,
and it is probably the general experience that members associated with
this work form the majority of those attending the Members' Meetings of
the Society. The strengthening of these organisations, drawing into
their membership larger numbers of Co-operators, would contribute to
solving the main problem of rousing interest in the affairs of the Society,
and getting wider participation in elections and quarterly meetings.

Perhaps better results could also be obtained if the members' meetings
of larger Societies were more widely distributed. Some medium-sized
Societies still hold only a single meeting, in spite of the wide area they
now cover; others have a number of meeting places, but not always
enough to make attendance easy for all members. It might be useful
also to give more publicity to the meetings.

Apart from the members' quarterly or half-yearly meetings, consideration
might be given to methods of drawing members registered at each
shop into some form of organised activity round the shop. Occasional
meetings on this basis would give members the opportunity of making
suggestions, and would also give the Management Committee (or District
Trading Committee where this exists; as in the London Society) the
opportunity of explaining difficulties, plans, etc., to the membership in a
more detailed way than is possible at the meetings which have to discuss
the affairs of the Society as a whole.

## Employees on Management Committees

There is still a measure of difference in the Movement with regard to
the status of employees and their right to sit on Management Committees
and similar bodies. We think that the only attitude consistent with
the principles of Co-operation is one that encourages all employees to be
members of their Societies, with the full rights of trading members
including the right of election to all Committees. Experience shows that
numbers of keen employees can and do contribute very greatly to cooperative
development by their work on Committees and Management
Boards.

On the other hand, the character of the Committees as representing
the whole membership should be maintained and for this reason we deem
it desirable that a majority of the members on all leading Committees
and Management Boards should be trading members not employed by
the Society.

## The Position of Employees

Another problem of the Movement, more acute as Societies grow in
size, is the maintenance of goodwill and mutual interest between the
Society and its employees.

It has always been a Co-operative principle to provide a good standard
of wages and conditions for Co-operative employees, and Societies in
general have operated this principle, giving a lead to the distributive
trades. Certain questions are still unsolved; for example, the rate for the
job is not recognised in practice, in spite of the fact that there is a wide
acceptance of the principle, and the gap between rates for males and
females almost everywhere remains a wide one.

Juniors' rates have been, and still are, too low, having in mind conditions
operating in many business organisations, and are not sufficient
to attract to the service of the Movement some of the best types of young
workers.

A further problem is the widely differing rates in operation ; in rural
districts and in areas subject to long periods of depression, rates are low
by national comparison, and since the war the improvement in the general
labour conditions and standards in these areas has made the problem
a more acute one and given rise to much dissatisfaction.

We favour the establishment of a National minimum scale which
would

(a) raise the standard of the lower-paid workers;
(b) increase the
rates for juniors;
(c) reduce the gap between male and female rates and
lead to the eventual establishment of the rate for the job;
(d) establish
the adult rate at 21 years of age;
(e) provide two weeks' holiday with
pay for all employees together with a reasonable period of sick pay.

Wartime experience of negotiations through the National Council of
Hours and Wages Boards has convinced us that the establishment of
National Negotiating machinery will be in the interest of the Movement
and its employees. The problems which we have enumerated could be
solved more speedily and satisfactorily by a National Wages Council.

With regard to workers in other countries employed by the British
Movement, it is essential to ensure good conditions of employment and the
encouragement of trade union organisation. In view of the considerable
scale of tea production in India and Ceylon on plantations owned and
managed by the British Movement, it would be useful to make a special
enquiry into conditions of employment for report to the Movement here.

Another problem, especially for the larger Societies, is to enlist the
active help and interest of employees in relation to the Society's affairs,
and thus strengthen the work of Management Committees and officials.
So far experience in many capitalist enterprises has shown the value of
Joint Production Committees; similar Committees have been established
in some Co-operative enterprises, but we believe that the idea should
be more widely applied, and consultative machinery on the lines of joint
Production Committees set up at all places of Co-operative employment.
Such Committees would be of great assistance to officials and to the
Management Committee on all practical questions that arose, and they
should help to widen the outlook and stimulate interest in the affairs of the
society among its employees, thus making them more capable and
enthusiastic in the service of the Movement.

The growth in size of the Movement and the development of new forms
of enterprise also makes it essential to consider the need for more highly
specialised and experienced staff in many departments. This need can
be met partly by more extensive schemes of training for Co-operative
employees; but in present conditions it is necessary to recognise that
the Movement requires the very best experts now available and that salaries
on the level of those paid by competitors must be paid in order to attract
and keep them.

In all staff training, technical training should be accompanied by
education in the principles of Co-operation and the aims of the Labour
Movement as a whole, so as to develop and strengthen loyalty to the
Movement and understanding of its purpose.

Another problem which has become important in the larger Societies
is that of the welfare of employees. The suggestion has been made that
every large Society should appoint a Welfare Officer, who would be
responsible for developing health services, rest rooms and canteens and
recreation clubs, as well as helping to look after the general welfare of
employees. Such Officers exist in most large capitalist enterprises ; they
could be even more useful in all large Co-operative Societies.

## Relations with the Labour Movement

The key to the relationship between the Co-operative Movement,
the Trade Unions and the Labour Party lies in the fact that they each,
in their different spheres, represent and promote the interests and well
being of the working class and the common people against reactionary
and monopoly interests, and that they have the common aim of a new
order of Society.

The decision of the Co-operative Union in 1941 to become "a full
partner with the industrial and political sides of the movement in the
National Council of Labour" was in itself a recognition of this identity
of interests with regard to both immediate and ultimate objectives.

Much however remains to be done to consolidate and strengthen these
links. It has to be recognised that the Co-operative Movement came
into the political field comparatively late, and that there is room for a
considerable extension of its political activity, which can draw into
organised political life large numbers of working people not effectively
reached through other sections of the Labour Movement, but who value
and understand their association with the Co-operative Movement.

The national post-war policy, adopted by the 1943 Co-operative
Congress, and published under the title of _The World We Want_, sets out
the broad lines of a programme with which, in the main, every section
of the Labour Movement is in agreement. But in order that the Movement
may be fully prepared for the united action which alone can realise this
programme, the whole position needs to be reviewed by the Co-operative
Union and the National Council of Labour, with a view to getting a
clearer understanding and a great increase of joint activity. We believe
that any feeling of rivalry between the Co-operative Party and Labour
Party is harmful to the development of the whole Movement and that
there should be the closest association between these parties, both in
Parliament, through their Executives and in their local organisations.
In view of the character of the Labour Party as the federal organisation
of working-class bodies for political purposes this association should
eventually take the form of affiliation of the Co-operative Party nationally
as well as locally to the Labour Party.

There is one issue of policy which has constantly been raised from
different standpoints by the Labour Party and Co-operative members.
Both sides are united in the aim of developing non-capitalist enterprise.
Labour Party supporters, however, favour the extension of municipal
trading, as against the view that Co-operative Societies should replace
private enterprise. We do not believe that it is useful or desirable to
establish any general principle. There is more than room enough for
both municipal and Co-operative enterprise in a country which is still
overwhelmingly capitalist. Historical conditions and opportunities have
led to the growth of municipal or Co-operative undertakings in particular
areas, and there is no need for any rivalry.

We would suggest, however, that in both National and Local plans
the Labour Party should take into account the part that the Co-operative
Movement can and should play. Municipal activities in particular can
often be strengthened through linking up with facilities that Co-operative
Societies can provide.

The relations between Co-operative Societies and Trade Unions must
be governed by their permanent common interests which can be summed
up as defending and advancing the living standards and the spending
power of working people, as well as their ultimate goal of changing society.
It is in Co-operative undertakings above all that the Trade Unions should
be able to play a constructive part in solving problems of output and
assisting new developments which will be useful to both Co-operators
and Trade Unionists. On the side of Management Committees and
officials and to some extent even members of Co-operative Societies
there is a tendency to regard the Trade Unions simply as negotiating
bodies on wages and conditions of employees. There is a corresponding
tendency on the part of trade union officials and members to regard
Management Committees and Co-operative officials as ordinary capitalist
employers and managers. Consciousness of their common interests
and mutual appreciation of the part that each is playing in their common
task provide the best basis for their relations with each other.
