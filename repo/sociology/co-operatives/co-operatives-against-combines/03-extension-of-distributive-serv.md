# EXTENSION OF DISTRIBUTIVE SERVICES

In 1939 average weekly purchases per member in all retail societies
amounted to about 12s. In 1942 the average had gone up to about 14s
--- less than the relative increase in prices. There was a wide variation in
purchases per member in different districts; from 9s. 7d. per week in
1939 in the South to over 17s. 8d. in Scotland. But members who could
claim to be "100 percent Co-operators" (even apart from what they
spend on rent, fares, light and fuel, other than coal, which Co-operative
Societies do not provide) have always been a minority. Some part of the
trade of nearly every member goes either to any shop which is within
easy rcach, or to the shop that offers more choice.

During the war a number of societies have recorded increases in trade.
The figures just quoted show that an advance from the pre-war 10 or 12
percent of retail trade to twice or three times that proportion, should be
reached within a comparatively short time, on the basis of a development
policy which did more to meet the whole needs of existing members and
drew in many more members. Such a policy would include :---

* A rapid increase in the number of Co-operative shops, including
both small units such as bread shops, tobacconists and greengrocers ;
specialised shops, for example pharmacies, book-shops, and men's
outfitters; and, in the shopping quarter of every community or
centre of population, a Co-operative Store including all main departments.

* The further development of new services, such as large-scale
catering, self-service shops and bazaar trading, and mail order
business.

* The sale of new types of goods, such as are suggested in connection
with Co-operative production ;

* Publicity on a much more ambitious and up-to-date scale than the
Co-operative Movement up to now has ever attempted.

An increase in the number of shops, and particularly the successful
establishment of a Co-operative Store in every shopping centre is especially
necessary.

To ensure that retail distribution is controlled and organised to meet
the consumption needs of the population, and to safeguard the position of
shopkeepers whose shops have been destroyed or closed down during the
war, the system of licences should be continued. It will therefore be necessary
in many cases for Co-operative Societies to come to an arrangement
with existing businesses. In the case of new estates developed under the
Government's Housing and Town Planning schemes, Co-operative
Societies should secure sites for shops to serve the needs of co-operators
on these estates. In all cases the demand for Co-operative service in a
particular area should be a recognised ground for the granting of a licence.

## Food

Co-operative Societies are now distributing one-third of the country's
milk and a quarter of its bread. These two essential foods are so important
for the health of the population, and make up so large a part of Co-operative
trade, that they must take first place in any consideration of expanding
distribution.

\ 

**Bread**: A statement by a director of the C.W.S. in January, 1944,
showed that while 500 Co-operative Societies are making 25 percent
of the country's bread, 40 large capitalist concerns are making 50 percent.
The most important questions for examination therefore, include:---

* Steps to establish a greater number of large-scale bakeries, with
the most up-to-date mechanical equipment.

* Further development of scientific research, on the lines already
undertaken by the Wholesale Society, so as to produce the best
bread from the standpoint of food value, as well as of other selling
qualities.

* The supply of bread from Co-operative bakeries (which must be
owned in the main by retail societies, individually or jointly within a
small area) to small shops and confectioners.

\ 

**Milk**: The Co-operatives have always played a large part in the
campaign for a pure milk supply, and have been pioneers in many districts,
in establishing pasteurisation. At the present time the necessity for a
clean milk supply in the interests of national health, is more widely
recognised than ever before. But the processing plant existing in the
country as a whole is not enough to meet the demand, although the
change-over to high temperature pasteurisation is increasing the supply
of pasteurised milk.

It is essential that Co-operative Societies should be able to secure the
necessary equipment for the processing, bottling and delivery of milk,
at the highest standard of cleanliness and keeping qualities.

Already, some Co-operative Societies, which would not have been able
to set up separate dairies, have joined with neighbouring Societies to
establish jointly-owned dairies. The extension of this idea would help
to increase the Co-operative share of the milk trade.

At the same time the maximum use of all Co-operative plant, by processing
for small retailers, where equipment is not used to capacity, would
develop new links between the Co-ops and small producers and increase
the total supply of safe milk.

\ 

**Catering**: One of the great changes in the life of the British people
during the war has been the development of meals away from the home.
In British Restaurants, factory canteens and schools throughout the
country thousands of men, women and children are taking their main
meals and no longer depend exclusively on home preparation for all their
meals.

>During the rationing year just ended the number of children
receiving school meals has been more than doubled. It is now about
1,250,000, or just over one-fifth of the school population, and Mr.
Butler and Lord Woolton have put forward as a practical target the
feeding of three-quarters of all school children. Since August of last
year the number of British Restaurants has increased more slowly,
from about 1,700 to about 2,120 and over 3,000,000 meals a week
are being served. Mr. Mabane has stated that some 3,500,000
people, about one-quarter of all workers, eat a mid-day meal of some
description in industrial canteens and this implies that canteen
facilities have been more than doubled in a year.
These are impressive
advances. Yet much remains to be done. (Times --- 4.8.43.)

Much does remain to be done, and because the Co-operative Movement
has identified itself so much with the provision of the people's food it
cannot allow so much of their expenditure on food to pass out of the
Co-operative sphere.

The organisation of catering in its various forms is so obviously suited
to the outlook and accumulated experience of Co-operatives that the
Movement should have assumed a big role from the start. Members
would welcome the entry of their Societies into this field, and non-cooperators
would gain a first experience of the Movement's efficiency and
value that would induce them to join local Societies for their general
purchases.

The action already taken by particular Societies in running canteens
and restaurants can now become the basis of a general policy throughout
the Movement, so that the public will become aware that the Co-operatives
have identified themselves with this great development. New restaurants
should be established. Education Authorities should be induced to take
their food supplies and equipment for the schools from their local Societies.
Strong efforts should be made to become suppliers to factory canteens and,
in addition, undertake the catering completely, all as an extension of what
is already being done in a small way.

The new catering department of the Co-operative Wholesale Society
should be of great assistance to retail Societies in organising and equipping
restaurants and canteens. Research by the Co-operative Wholesale
Society on nutrition problems might also be of great value to all Societies.

Another and older aspect of catering is the chain-type restaurant and
tea-shop. No one is very well satisfied with the value given in these, and
in many provincial towns they scarcely exist. The Movement has enormous
resources for supplying such outlets for food, and again bringing
Co-operative methods further into the lives of the people. The improvement
of conditions for catering workers overcomes a former difficulty in
this regard, and there seems no reason why Co-operative Societies should
not enter the caf√© and snack bar trade on a big scale, particularly in
industrial towns and holiday centres.

\ 

**Drinks**: Apart from alcoholic drinks, there are "soft" drinks and milk
beverages to be sold and consumed on the premises, and there is every
reason why the Co-operatives should try to cater for part of this large
trade. As to beers and spirits, more Co-operative stores should have
off-licences as a normal department, and so enable members to spend
their money inside the Movement.

\ 

**Bazaar trading**: Besides extending catering, it would be possible to
establish more self-service grocery counters within the large stores, or as
part of a new development in bazaar trading. Where bazaar trading
has been attempted boldly, it has been successful, for the very good
reason that it provides what is increasingly popular in our generation.
It is one thing of course, to organise bazaar conditions for displaying and
selling goods customary in Co-operative shops, and quite another to introduce
new mass-production cheap articles, competing with the 3d. and
6d. bazaar of the pre-war type. The latter proposition has always raised
the question of whether traditional Co-operative quality and purity could
be maintained.

It must, however, be recognised that a bazaar of what is now the customary
type implies a level of quality known and expected by shoppers
who use it when they want something cheap, and are not thinking about
quality and durability. Further, the low prices are obtained through
large-scale purchasing and giving long-term contracts. The Co-operative
Wholesale Society can buy in the same way, given a general decision by the
larger Societies to give support by opening Bazaar Departments.

\ 

**Greengrocery**: Vegetables and fruit are specially important in the
nation's food, both from the standpoint of sound diet and because homegrown
supplies make up the great majority of these fresh foods. Their
proper handling without waste and in good condition is a very important
part of retail distribution. Direct supply through Co-operative channels
would avoid middlemen's charges and guarantee regular supplies and fair
prices to grower and consumer.

But it is not an easy trade to organise, and it cannot be said that Cooperative
Societies have so far been as successful in the greengrocery
trade as they have, for example, in the dairy trade.

It seems that the best solution will be found by adapting to the fruit
and vegetable trade the main principles that now apply to the milk trade
--- direct collection by Co-operative Societies from producers in the countryside,
either individually, or, when this is possible, on the basis of cooperative
organisation of the small growers themselves; transport in
properly equipped rail or road vehicles to depots in the main centres of
population for checking and grading; and delivery from these depots to
greengrocery shops which must stand comparison, in lay-out and equipinent,
with the best the private traders has to offer.

This would involve establishing a network of depots at the best points
for distribution to the various areas and suburbs of industrial towns, and
would do away to a great extent with the use of central wholesale markets
which often become a bottleneck in the whole process. At the same time
it would bring small growers more directly into the sphere of Co-operative
trade.

\ 

**Fish**: The fish trade, which has hardly been touched by many of even
the large retail Societies, offers the possibility of a similar type of organisation,
with the collection and distribution of supplies through Co-operative
channels from the fishermen to the consumers. The extension of Cooperative
factories at the fishing ports, for canning and curing fish not
required for immediate consumption, would be a great help in maintaining
a steady market for the fishermen and steady supplies for consumers.
The possibility of large-scale developments in this direction,
with the opening of more sales points throughout the country and the
building up of Co-operative markets abroad, should be carefully examined.

## Other Goods

Co-operative sales of other goods than food have not by any means
kept pace with the general expansion of the Societies' trade. In 1936
grocery, bread, meat and milk represented 76 percent. All other trade,
including coal, footwear and clothing, furniture and hardware, and Cooperative
services such as laundry, pharmacy and funeral furnishing
together, only made up 24 percent of total trade.

After the war millions of people will need all kinds of consumption
goods --- above all furniture and household equipment of every sort. In
these goods, presenting much less difficult problems of distribution than
the food trades, which Co-operatives have organised so successfully,
there are great possibilities of expansion for all Societies, whether in
larger centres of population or in small country towns.

But to secure this trade, Co-operative Societies will have to set a high
standard not only in the quality but also in the style and design of the
furniture, clothing and other dry goods on sale at Co-operative shops,
and in methods of advertising and salesmanship.

\ 

**Furniture and household equipment**: Over the last quarter century
there has taken place a marked change in the furnishing and equipment
of the people's homes. Although the Movement is the largest single
manufacturer of furniture, a quite insufficient part has been played by
the Co-operatives in meeting this new type of demand. Here again,
therefore, is an opportunity that ought no longer to be left largely to
capitalist exploitation. The Co-operatives should make a bold bid to
furnish the new homes of the British people.

Linked to furnishing are radio, refrigerators, electrical appliances,
lighting fitments, etc. The new homes, and many of the older, will have
electricity supply, and manufacturers are preparing to cater for the huge
demand that is going to arise. The Co-operatives should plan to cater
for much of this demand and handle such lines in a bold and distinctive
way. Nowadays --- and increasingly in the future --- these commodities are
no longer "middle-class" luxuries, and should be on sale in the workers'
shops.

\ 

**Decoration materials**: The success of the multiple wallpaper and paint
shops catering for the greater interest to-day taken in home decoration
points to a further activity awaiting co-operative enterprise.

\ 

**Clothing and Footwear**: Clothes and shoes and millinery, to meet the
different needs and changing tastes of young people as well as of the
long-established members, will have to find their place in Co-operative
shops everywhere. Consideration should be given not only to materials
and workmanship, but fashion and design as well, if Co-operatives are to
develop this trade extensively.

\ 

**Departmental stores and specialised shops**: Departmental stores have
on the whole been successful, and Societies which have done nothing or
very little in this direction will rieed to develop this form of sales organisation.
At the same time there is every reason to open specialised shops
in certain conditions. Specialisation enters into every class of retail
distribution, and the speciality shop permits of development where
otherwise a Society would have to depend only on its departmental stores
for lines outside of the grocery--provision--butchery combination. The
management of a range of speciality shops requires new methods, and a
new standard of training in salesmanship and display will also be needed.

\ 

**Pharmacy**: One department of co-operative retail is becoming specially
important in relation to proposals for a National Health Service. The
rapid development of pharmacy shops could provide a Co-operative chemist
within reach of every health centre. But again this possibility will
depend, not only on acquiring or establishing shops, but also on facilities
and encouragement for young employees (especially girls) to become
qualified chemists. Consideration should also be given to the development
of the optical trade.

\ 

**Mail order business**: In the non-food trades particularly, mail orders
represent a very large retail turnover. Hitherto Co-operatives have
taken a very small share in this trade. But here is clearly a field for
joint effort and organisation by Co-operative Societies.

The Movement could establish a joint society to develop mail order
business on a national scale. When ordering, buyers who were Cooperators
would give the name of their Society and their share number.
The surplus of the joint Society could then be distributed according to
trade done with members of each of the constituent Societies.

Mail orders would help to extend Co-operative trade to the countryside
and small country towns, and thus open more widely an important field
not yet sufficiently developed by Co-operative shops.

\ 

**Small shops as Co-operative agencies**: In country areas, no less than
in large towns, there is another channel through which Co-operative trade
can be brought to people it has not yet reached. The village shop in the
countryside and the small grocery or draper's shop in a larger town are
owned in the main by people who have the same background and belong
to the same kind of household as the great majority of Co-operators.
As traders, they have many interests in common with Co-operative
Societies; both are against high rents and indirect taxation, for a fair
allocation of supplies and control of wholesale prices.

But the fact that Co-operative expansion has involved taking over
some small businesses has been the pretext for sections of the press,
voicing the interests of the Combines, to raise an outcry against the
Co-operatives, with the aim of diverting the attention of small shopkeepers
from the operations of the Combines.

Any division between the Co-operatives and the small traders weakens
both in relation to the Combines. Moreover, the small trader is often
in a position to supply Co-operators with such of their requirements as
are not handled by Co-operative shops within easy reach. Agreement
with small shopkeepers in such cases to act as agents for Co-operative
Societies, on terms which enabled Co-operators to get their dividend on
purchases made from them, would both extend total Co-operative sales,
make purchases easier for Co-operators, and establish good relations
between the small shopkeepers and the Movement.

## Special Services

**Housing**: The need for houses is felt by great numbers of co-operators
and various suggestions have been made that their need can and should
be met through the Co-operative Movement itself.

Housing is however such a vast problem that it can only be tackled
seriously by the State and the local authorities. So far as the Co-operative
Movement is concerned there are two ways in which it can help without
attempting any great development such as would tie up a large portion
of its funds, urgently needed as they are for other Co-operative developments
more directly affecting the general membership.

There is already in existence the Co-operative Permanent Building
Society, which has done very useful work and should develop on the basis
of its own resources.

There are also in existence a certain number of Housing Societies
registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts. The finance
of each Housing Society is provided by its own members through shares
(up to ¬£200) and loans, including mortgages, loans from the Co-operative
Building Society, and from local authorities which have the power to
help in such schemes. The houses built are as a rule rented to share
holders.

Here we have a development of the principle of Co-operation which
draws in new funds from members directly affected. Provided that each
housing society is directly governed by these members, this means the
principle of co-operation is maintained and development made possible
without drawing on the accumulated funds of the distributive Societies.

But in connection with housing, we feel that the principal help to be given
by the Co-operative Movement to its members lies in the sphere of
furnishing and equipment for their houses, whether new or old. This
seems to us to be in line with the general development of the distributive
Co-operatives and to be more helpful to the general membership of the
Societies than the use of funds to build houses for what can be only a small
proportion of the membership.

\ 

**Co-operative Centres**: Co-operators and members of the whole Labour
Movement have often enough discussed the need for a social centre for
the Movement in each town or locality. A centre for meetings, concerts,
dramatic shows, for games and gymnasium, for reading and social life.
The Co-operative and Labour Movement has the members and resources
to create such centres. As it is, essential activities are forced into hired
premises that mostly are inadequate and dreary, and many activities that
would enliven and strengthen the Movement cannot be attempted at all.

In London and the larger provincial towns one such centre as is suggested
should have bedrooms, a restaurant and common rooms for members of the
Labour Movement passing through or making a stay. We hope the project
for such a centre in London to mark the Centenary will be accepted and
carried through.

Distributive Societies should accept the responsibility for building and
administering such centres, deeming it a service needed by their members
and a striking means of showing to the world in general the power and
importance of the Movement.

\ 

**Drama and Music**: For many years Co-operators have organised
amateur drama and music activities through the auxiliary bodies. This
is valuable work and deserves additional encouragement and financial
support, for it meets the need of people for self-expression and development.

Recent developments through the People's Entertainment Society are
very encouraging. A great campaign should be made to interest the whole
membership and attract share and loan investment in the People's
Entertainment Society and enable it to undertake a vigorous programme
and extend its activities to all parts of the country. Apart from the
importance of this work, it would bring the Co-operative Movement in yet
another way into the lives of the people and strengthen its hold upon their
esteem and loyalty.

\ 

**Cinemas**: The use of the cinema for educational purposes and for
entertainment is already familiar to many Co-operative Societies, but it
must be said that only a very small proportion of the membership is
reached by such films as the Co-operative Movement either produces or
obtains from other sources. Moreover, the part which the Co-operative
Movement can play in this field must not be limited to Co-operative
members. The use of films for stimulating the political consciousness of
the whole Labour Movement and providing entertainment at meetings
of the Labour Movement is as yet hardly felt. What is needed, therefore,
is a great expansion in this whole field of activity which would involve
the equipment of all Co-operative halls with either standard or sub-standard
projectors, and provision of mobile projecting units to serve the whole
area covered by the Society.

In the People's Centres which are suggested for the larger towns there
should be a fully equipped cinema, and first rate films running continuously.
In certain cases it might also be possible, following up the example of the
Scunthorpe and other Societies, to buy existing cinemas and develop
both the use of films and other educational and social activities around the
cinema.

It may even be possible to develop, alongside the People's Entertainment
Society, a National People's Cinema Society associated with the Cooperative
Movement.

\ 

**Holidays**: The principal recreation where Co-operative enterprise has
a bigger part to play is in connection with holidays. An annual holiday is
a new feature in many workers' lives, and proper facilities for making such
holidays enjoyable and useful have yet to be organised. As matters stood
up to 1939, it was no easy matter for a working-class family to go to the
seaside or country for their annual holiday, what with the lodgings racket,
the discomfort, objections to children and the shortage of accommodation,
although the Co-operative Holidays Association and the Workers' Travel
Association were organising services to meet these needs.

There is no reason why the many hotels and holiday camps that will
have to be established should become the preserve of the profit-makers.
Co-operative service of this sort would be another form in which the
working class may be enabled to organise its own affairs and keep the
profit-makers out, to secure its recreation at a lower cost and under
conditions of its own choosing.

\ 

**Publishing**: The Co-operative Movement is already publishing a
number of periodicals, pamphlets and books, in the main dealing with
the Co-operative Movement itself, as well as _Reynolds' News_. The field
is open for a much wider range of popular magazines, text books, fiction,
children's books, etc., as well as the printing of cheap reproductions of
art works. Such a development, along with the opening of more book
departments in the shops, would be both profitable and welcomed by the
membership.

\ 

**Publicity**: An energetic and continuous campaign is essential in
connection with every development proposed, and to ensure the all-round
growth of the Movement. The present and projected need for publicity
requires a centralised publicity service, organised and staffed up to the
level of the large and well-equipped publicity departments and advertising
agencies used by capitalist competitors, and using every possible medium
for publicity.

Such a centralised service, in addition to preparing general material
for Co-operative propaganda on a national scale (as in connection with the
Centenary), would also be available for consultation by the separate
Societies, in planning and carrying out their own special publicity.
