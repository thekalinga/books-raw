# RELATIONS WITH THE MOVEMENT ABROAD

The brotherhood of man is more than an aspiration to co-operators; they
attempt to build it.

The British Co-operative Movement has repeatedly shown its concern
in international questions, as having a bearing on the prosperity and
safety of the Movement and on the welfare of its members. In the last
twenty-five years it has done much to influence public opinion in favour
of better relations with the Soviet Union, with Republican Spain and
China, and against the spread of Fascism in Europe. It has associated
itself with the demand for the freedom of India. It is participating fully
in the fight for the destruction of Fascism, which has destroyed the
Co-operative Movement in so many countries of Europe.

Alongside of its political activity on international issues and its participation
in the International Co-operative Alliance, the British Co-operative
Movement has been able to establish direct economic links with
Co-operative organisations in other countries. The most fully developed
up to 1939 were with the Scandinavian countries and in the Soviet Union;
but trade was also growing with Co-operative organisations in other
countries. Apart from the well-established national organisations, an
interesting example is the trade established by the Co-operative Wholesale
Society with West African growers of cocoa and palm kernels, who formed
Co-operative Societies on the Gold Coast and in Nigeria for collective
marketing.

When the destruction of Fascism and the resumption of normal international
trade make development possible there will be unprecedented
opportunities for trade between the British Movement and the Movement
abroad. In the first stage, much help will have to be given in the rebuilding
of the Co-operative organisations in Europe; the British Movement
has already begun its preparations for this, in connection with the
"Freedom Fund" to help the Co-operatives in European countries after
their liberation. But with the restoration of normal conditions the
Co-operative Movement in every country is likely to grow rapidly in
strength and to be one of the most important instruments in raising the
standard of living throughout the world.

This was recognised by the representatives of the United Nations at
the Hot Springs Conference, which recommended that "All countries
study the possibilities of the further establishment of producer and
consumer Co-operative societies in order to render the necessary production,
marketing, purchasing, finance and other services."

The growth of Co-operative organisation in every country can be
greatly helped by the development of regular trading links with the
Movement in other countries, which can make considerable inroads into
the trade in raw materials and manufactured goods now in the hands of
the Combines and large privately-owned companies. The British Movement,
with its great experience and financial stability, will undoubtedly
play a leading part in this development, with corresponding advantage to
Co-operators here and abroad ; and it will feel its special responsibility
to help forward the people in British colonial territories, on the lines
already undertaken in West Africa, as indicated above.
