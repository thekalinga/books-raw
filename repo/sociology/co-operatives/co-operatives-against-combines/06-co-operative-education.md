# CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION

The Education work of the Co-operatives has always held a very
important place in the life of the Movement. It is carried out in the
main by the Education Committees of the Retail societies, and by the
Guilds and Youth organisations. Many Societies by rule set aside 2½ percent
of their surplus for education grants; in 1939 these grants amounted
to about £300,000. Thousands of lectures, week-end schools, conferences,
film shows, choirs and dramatic clubs are organised in all parts of the
country, and the College at Manchester offers full time Co-operative
education on a scholarship basis.

## Education Committees

Education Committees in general recognise that it is their purpose
to carry out education, mainly adult education, on the basis of "Education
for Social Change." It is recognised that Co-operative trading
activities alone cannot bring into being a membership strong enough,
and clear enough in its purpose, to achieve the aims of the Co-operative
Movement; and that a strong trading organisation itself depends to a
great extent on how far the members are conscious Co-operators.

Valuable as the work already performed has proved, there can be no
doubt that in the coming period there will be the greatest necessity to
strengthen and intensify this activity, planning to reach out to newer
sections of the membership by new forms of propaganda and publicity
and by consolidating existing Education machinery.

Steps should be taken to begin this work where it has not yet been
undertaken; it would help rapid development if all the larger Societies
appointed full-time Education Secretaries or officials, and if Committees
drew on the interest and initiative of the most active students from classes
and Conferences, in this way securing their help in arranging future
events and programmes. All students should become part of the Education
Fellowship around the Committee. In addition, the taking over of
Education central premises where day and week schools could be held
for both members and employees will greatly facilitate development.

Every effort should be made, with the help of Co-operative officials
and employees, to make known to the members the educational and
cultural facilities which the Society is providing.

Finally, the movement should give the greatest support for the establishment
of the new National Co-operative College which will enable
the Movement to work out national schemes on Education programmes
for Residential and Summer schools.

## Co-operative Guilds

The Co-operative Guilds have a splendid record of service to the
Movement. They made a unique contribution through their initiative
in helping to develop Co-operative trade, and their own high standard
of devotion to Co-operative interests. At the same time, they built
up their strength through educational work, combined with a wide range
of activity on social and political issues.

But in recent years, particularly during the war, the Women's Guild,
although it still forms by far the most important section of Guild organisation,
has declined in membership and activity. This has been due partly
to war conditions. But the slow recruitment among younger Co-operators
must also be connected with the pacifism of the leaders, which has sometimes
taken extreme forms out of harmony with the policy of the Co-operative
Movement; and also with the existing undemocratic limitations on the
right of members to elect those who they think are best fitted for official
positions, through the ban on the Communists. For these reasons, the
Guild has not by any means kept pace with the growing membership
of the Societies.

Conditions for Co-operative trade are much easier to-day, in spite of war
restrictions, than they were in the early days of the Guilds. But the
very growth in membership and trading opportunities means that there
is urgent need for a renewal of the spirit and determination of the Guilds-women
who did so much to make the Co-operative Movement a living
force. Formerly it was the Guild members who were most constantly alive
to new possibilities of production and trade, new chances for Co-operative
development of all kinds; and it was they who took the lead, at a time
when the average earnings of women were less than 12s. a week, in campaigning
for a higher standard for Co-operative employees.

The work that has been done during the war by many Guild branches
in helping to secure war-time nurseries, increased allowances for soldiers'
families, educational reform, better housing and other social demands,
shows that the Guild has an important part to play in advancing the
interests of working-class housewives. But their special work for the
Co-operative Movement itself needs to be brought into closer touch with
present requirements and opportunities. They could have a great
influence in helping forward new kinds of publicity for Co-operation, and
extending Co-operative distribution in the direction we have outlined in
other sections.

Changes will have to be made in the rules and procedure of the Women's
Guild, and greater encouragement given to their activity in association
with other organisations, if the Guild is to be successful in recruiting
large numbers of young housewives, in becoming once again the most
active and vigilant section of Co-operators, and regaining its outstanding
position among working-class women.

## Co-operative Youth

Co-operative youth work and organisation covers a very wide range of
activities and interests among young people. Today it is winning
increasing recognition, inside and outside the Co-operative Movement,
and from Government departments. The whole of the youth work of
the Movement is now reaching a stage in which it is co-ordinated on a
national scale through the Educational Council and its Executive under the
Co-operative Union. But the work and membership of the Council
itself needs re-examination, to ensure that it is composed of people with
experience as educationalists and first-hand knowledge of the problems.

In connection with the Service of Youth there are upwards of 350 Youth
Clubs with about 40,000 members, catering for adolescents between 16
and 20. Playway and Pathfinder Groups for the younger ones number
400 with about 15,000 members. Bridging the gap between Youth Clubs
and the adult organisations of the Movement is the British Federation of
Young Co-operators (B.F.C.Y.) for young adults between ages 18/20
to 25, now receiving substantial financial help from the Co-operative
Union. In addition, the Woodcraft Folk, an organisation which was
started twenty years ago in the London area to bring children together
for collective open-air activities of various kinds, has now become a
recognised part of the Co-operative Union Youth Movement.

A new and very important development is the establishment of
Co-operative Youth Centres. For this purpose a separate national
society was formed in 1944, whose principal object is to carry on "residential
youth centres, camps and schools to meet the educational and
recreative needs of the members and the families of members of Cooperative
Societies." A beginning has already been made with the
acquisition of two houses in the North of England and the plan for a
network of well-equipped centres, with buildings and grounds typical
of the English country house, gives the opportunity for opening up new
and most attractive forms of Co-operative service.

The appeal of the Co-operative Movement to young people lies in the
outlets it gives to the constructive energy and idealism of youth, and in
the striking example it provides of working-class capacity, of aspiration
become reality.

Is the Movement possessed of the right means to recruit and receive
into its ranks the girls and lads, the young men and women, needed for
its own programme of development, and for the wider purposes it serves?
Undoubtedly the machinery for this exists. The fact that it is not working
to full capacity, nor expanding rapidly enough to meet the vast possibilities,
is due chiefly to the slowness of the adult organisations of all
kinds in realising how great these possibilities are, and providing the
right type of assistance. The Movement should provide well-equipped
premises for continuous use by the Youth Clubs. There is great need
for adults, who recognise the ability of young people to manage their own
affairs, and have themselves an all-round experience in the Movement,
to take part in the work of the youth organisations in a way that will
make them a training ground for the active membership of the future,
and at the same time will enable the young members to take a fully responsible
part in their own organisation.

This means not only that a high standard of social, cultural and sports
activity has to be reached, but that the special character of Co-operative
education and the purpose that it serves must be the guiding influence
in all Co-operative Youth Work, including particularly the work of the
Clubs.

In its youth organisation as in all its other activities the Co-operative
Movement should be closely linked with other sections of the Labour
Movement. It would be an immense advantage to the whole Movement
if a single Socialist Youth Organisation could be brought into existence.
While therefore, we greatly appreciate the work that has been done by
the Co-operative Youth organisations, and believe that this work should
be continued and strengthened, we also suggest that the British Federation
of Young Co-operators should take part in building up a single Socialist
Youth Organisation for the Labour Movement as a whole.
