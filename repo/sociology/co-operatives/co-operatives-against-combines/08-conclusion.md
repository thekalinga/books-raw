# CONCLUSION

Our suggestions for the main direction of Co-operative development
in the period following the war are, we believe, in line with the traditions
and experience of the Movement, and present no difficulties which the
Movement cannot overcome.

We are confident that the generation which has experienced this war
--- especially those who have served in the Forces --- will make far-reaching
demands for a better life ; and that political action, founded on a united
Labour Movement in alliance with all other progressive sections of the
people, will be able to sweep aside the dead hand of Toryism and guarantee
that these demands are met.

In such conditions the Government, backed by a Labour and progressive
majority in the House of Commons and a united Movement in the country,
will be able to carry through definite measures of social advance, to
nationalise important sections of industry, and to establish a firm control
on prices and supplies and on the operations of the Combines.

It is against this background that plans for the development of Cooperative
organisation and activity must be considered. The control of
prices and supplies, which cuts so deeply into the profit-grabbing policy
of the monopolists, is in complete harmony with Co-operative trading
policy, and indeed provides an excellent basis for vigorous development.
Much can be done through Government channels to improve conditions
for the people. But what it does will have deep and permanent effects
only if at the same time the working people and their organisations,
through their independent activity and initiative, help to maintain the
forward drive and strengthen the democratic power of the people.

The task of the British Co-operative Movement in this situation is to
throw the whole of its resources and energies into the maximum expansion
of its distributive and productive structure, so that it can meet the new
and increasing consumer demands of the people. The weakening of the
monopolists and profit-seeking Combines will in part be accomplished
through the competitive effect of a bold drive by the Movement to thrust
its distributive network into a dominant position throughout the country.
Challenging initiative of this kind will have a full and enthusiastic response
from a generation to whom the arbitrary power and profit motives of
capitalism have become repugnant, as the source of social evils and
stunted opportunity. The dividend on purchases, through which the
Movement has been built up in the past and must continue to be built
in the future, together with the democratic collective character of the
Societies, express the fight against the privately-owned, profit-seeking
Combines.

In the field of culture and education and by the political mobilisation
of its vast membership, the Co-operative Movement has resources which
equally must be utilised in a tremendous constructive effort for advancing
its size and power and thereby advancing, too, the common aims of the
whole working class and all progressive people.

Neither the Co-operatives, nor the Trade Unions, nor the working-class
political parties, can fully carry their responsibility without a clear
understanding of the part that each is playing in the common struggle
to end the profit-making system and build a new order of society. Given
this understanding, and the mutual help and joint activity that follows
from it, each section of the Movement can develop rapidly in the coming
period. If the favourable opportunities are seized, and the democratic
power of the united membership used to the full, great new strength can
come to the Movement, and the working people of Britain can confidently
face the future.
