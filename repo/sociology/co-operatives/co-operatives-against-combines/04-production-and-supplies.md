# PRODUCTION AND SUPPLIES

Present sources of supply to Co-operative Societies are mainly of two
kinds : productive undertakings owned by the Co-operative Movement,
and large-scale manufacture owned by capitalist firms. In addition,
certain commodities (for example milk) are supplied to a considerable
extent by small producers.

At the beginning of the war about 40 percent of the total value of
Co-operative retail trade was made up of goods and services coming from
Co-operative productive undertakings (though including raw materials
from capitalist sources): 60 percent came from other sources.

British Co-operatives have grown up primarily as consumers' Societies.
After the struggles of the Societies in the early period, they grew and
flourished in the later part of the 19th century on the basis of helping to
distribute consumers' goods produced by capitalist industry, but did not
seriously enter the field of production. With the development of the
food trusts, and the growing strength of the Co-operatives themselves,
they became rivals to monopoly in the distributive sphere, and in the years
of economic depression the need to establish independent sources of supply
was becoming more and more evident. Some effort was made to meet
this need both by increasing C.W.S. production and by greater output
from Productive Societies. Between 1932 and 1939 the value of C.W.S.
and Scottish C.W.S. production had almost doubled, and the output of
Productive Societies went up by over 30 percent. But the total in 1939
from all three sources was only about £62 million, including the value of
raw materials from capitalist sources. If production by retail Societies
(largely bakeries) and the output from tea plantations owned by
the English and Scottish Joint C.W.S. are included, the total is about
£100 millions.

War time restrictions, the taking over of C.W.S. factories for Government
work, and the limitation of supplies of consumption goods, have
probably meant a decrease in the proportion of Co-operative-produced
goods sold by Societies during the war.

In what direction can a Co-operative Movement rapidly expanding
its distributive trade look to obtain the increased supplies required?

## Agricultural products

Direct production on farms or estates, owned
by Co-operative Societies, of cereals, milk, sugar, tea, cocoa, palm kernels
and meat, on a scale which would meet all the needs of the retail trade,
would require a very large investment of capital, and, therefore, would
in fact tend to prevent the expansion of Co-operative processing, manufacture
and retail trade. While farms owned by Societies are of great
value in setting up high standards of food production on the basis of direct
experience, the majority of supplies must come from other sources. An
increase in supplies of primary products to Co-operative Societies will
have to be found in a much more rapid development of Co-operative
purchasing from small producers on the lines already established for milk
in this country, or for palm kernels in West Africa, and through agricultural
Co-operatives.

## Agricultural Co-operatives

In Britain, although Co-operative Societies
are so closely connected with agriculture, both through direct purchase
from farmers and through a certain number of their own farms, agricultural
Co-operation, in the sense of collective buying and marketing
through farmers' Co-operatives, has made very little headway.

At present there are about ninety farmers' Societies for the Co-operative
purchase of requirements, and about the same number for Co-operative
marketing. The turnover of the buying Societies last year was about
£9,000,000 and of the marketing Societies about £6,000,000. There are
also 16 Societies for joint threshing and miscellaneous services.

War conditions have brought changes, such as the joint use of machinery
and skilled labour, which to some extent have prepared the way for the
further development of agricultural Co-operatives. The systematic
building up of this form of Co-operative enterprise would be of great
importance for the Movement as a whole, and would help to establish a
growing source of supplies for the distributing Societies. It would also
be an important step for the fight of the farmers against the combines
both in supplies and in marketing ; it would strengthen the use of modern
technique in farming; and it would extend the basis for Co-operative
principles in agriculture, which is so vital for the future organisation of
British economy.

## Processing and Manufacture

So far as factories owned by Co-operative
Societies are concerned, expansion will be particularly useful in two main
directions --- the processing and/or manufacture of food products; and
the manufacture of clothing, boots, furniture, hardware and other domestic
requirements, which can be best supplied by large-scale production
methods.

There is room for considerable extension of Co-operative manufacture
without tying up a very large proportion of the available funds, most of
which will be required for the enlargement of the distributive trade.

If Co-operative investment is planned so as to seize the opportunities
of _new_ production of consumers' goods, which the needs of the people in
the immediate post-war period will open up, there will be the possibility
of a very rapid development. In plastics and the large-scale manufacture
of metal equipment and fittings for houses, in canned or packed foods,
in standardised furniture and clothing, on the lines of utility goods, and
in equipment for sports, games, athletics and camping, there will undoubtedly
be a great expansion. In all these, Co-operative production
could take an important place, provided that it is prepared to venture
into new fields, and to establish itself not only on the basis of existing
Co-operative demand, but by recognising other retailers as agents for the
sale of Co-operative manufactures.

## Organisation of Small Producers

In view of the great need for further
extension of the distributive network, it is almost inevitable that
Co-operative production, even though considerably increased, will still
meet only a small proportion of the Societies' needs. The distributive
Societies, whether through the wholesale Societies or directly, will therefore
still have to purchase a considerable part of their supplies from capitalist
firms.

Among capitalist manufacturing firms, there are a great many of
comparatively small size, which nevertheless even under present conditions
play a very important part in the total of manufactured goods.
There are still remains of the traditional hostility between the Co-operative
Movement and these small firms, and so long as this hostility continues
the owners of small businesses tend to be drawn into support of the
monopolists and big chain stores, rather than into connection with the
Labour and Co-operative Movement. We consider that from an economic
standpoint, both small manufacturers and the Co-operative Movement
would benefit by closer economic ties, which would also have their political
effects. The Co-operative Movement, through both the wholesale and the
distributive Societies, could establish permanent links with the manufacturers
of different lines of goods in such a way that their factories were
continuously employed on Co-operative needs, receiving any necessary
help towards modern equipment of their factories, and being encouraged
to maintain good Trade Union conditions for their workers. This would
assure the small manufacturers of a regular sale for their products and
would also enable the Co-operative Societies to break through any attempted
restriction of supplies on the part of the larger manufacturers and combines.
This suggestion is intended to apply over a very wide range of goods,
including clothing, fashion goods, furniture, household equipment, radios,
etc.

It is not entirely a new conception. Already in the past, thousands of
dairy farms outside those owned by Co-operative Societies, or grouped in
co-operative societies, regularly supplied the Co-operative Movement with
their products on a mutually satisfactory basis. We believe that this
system of regular purchase from the small manufacturers and producers
should be applied by the Movement to the greatest number of products
that could be obtained by such methods.

In all arrangements made either with small manufacturers or farmers,
it would be of considerable advantage to both sides if the materials required
by the producers could also be obtained through Co-operative channels,
which would be able to offer advantages through bulk buying and cooperative
connections here and abroad. The Co-operative Movement
would also be able to afford the best consultants in regard to methods
of production, design, etc.

It is a fiction, carefully spread by persons interested in monopolies,
that all small plants are necessarily inefficient. This is very far from the
case, and in many sections of industry, the small plant is even more
efficient, and is able to maintain its position in spite of the larger monopoly
units. Our proposal therefore, does not in any way involve keeping
alive inefficient firms which should be put out of existence. On the
contrary, in Britain to-day, some of the smaller firms are in any case used
by the monopolists and the big concerns, and the question is simply
whether the Co-operative Movement can benefit, from both an economic
and political standpoint, by establishing regular links that can at the same
time help the small producers and win their support and interest for the
progressive movement.
