_The industrial foreman today does not share in the decision-making process which is the core of managerial
functions. He is instead a transmittor of decisions which have been made by his superiors, yet the traditional
definition of the foreman's position and the current stated norms are based on the assumption that he has
decision-making power. The disparity between expectation and experience produces personal conflict and
disruption of managerial organization. The size of industrial units seems of less importance in producing this
marginal situation than does the concentration of decision-making in top management and the imposition
on foremen of rules made jointly by top management and worker unions._

\ 

In the voluminous literature on first-line
supervision in industry there are two major
concepts which have been used repeatedly in
sociological writing and in the technical literature
of personnel and business administration.
The first is that of the supervisor or
foreman as the first point in a clear-cut "line
of authority" extending from the worker to
the highest executive, thus playing the part
of the "key men of management," "the
firing line in union-management relations,
and "the most important link between management
and the worker." This concept,
variously expressed, rests on the assumption
of a unitary system of control and two-way
communication; it is at once an ideal and an
assumed norm of industrial organization. It
minimizes or ignores the impact of managerial
specialization and worker unionization.

A second concept, arising from interest in
deviations from the normative "line" concept,
views the first-line supervisor as "the
man in the middle." Emphasis is placed on
the fact that first-level management is subject
to two sets of demands which are frequently
in conflict; the foreman must satisfy
both top management and his work
force, which is usually organized. The "man
in the middle" interpretation is historical in
that it stresses the progressive limitations
placed on foremen through the growth of
managerial specialization and the increasing
pressure of worker unions. Supervision is
considered as still within the traditional line
organization but operating under severe
restrictions.

It is the purpose of this paper to reexamine
these interpretations and to suggest
an alternative formulation of the position
of industrial foremen. Neither concept
seems to describe the functions and informal
interpretations of supervision which the
writer has observed in a number of factories.
A few circumstances appear to be of major
importance in understanding the role of
first-line supervisors; the locus of the decision-making
or managerial function; the
focal points of union-management and employer-employee
relations; the significance
of size and complexity in management organization.
The last-named has often been
used to explain the decline in importance of
the foreman in large-scale manufacturing
enterprise. Many levels of supervision and
the presence of many specialized staff departments
restrict the power and authority
of the foreman; they also tend to make relationships
impersonal and indirect. The converse
of this theory would be that foremen
in smaller, less formal structures retain their
broad powers over shop affairs and therefore
are of considerable importance in managerial
activity and in worker-management
relations.

Unionization of the rank and file is commonly
regarded as further limiting the supervisor's
freedom of action and as setting
up a type of relation between worker and
management which parallels, and often conflicts
with, the relationship established
through the "line." Top management generally
takes the position that, in the presence
of a union, the foreman is still the primary
representative of management, especially
with reference to management policy and
grievance procedure.

The role of foremen in managerial activity
has been the subject of much discussion
in recent years. Top management holds
that the foreman plays an important part in
decision-making, while the Foremen's Association
of America states that foremen are
mere "representatives of management" and
have no power to make decisions. Restated,
the question is whether foremen are active
participants in managerial decision-making
activity or are simply transmitters of these
decisions. Here again the size of a given organization
has been considered important,
on the assumption that, with increased
numbers of persons and a lengthened "line"
organization, the share of foremen in decisions
will be made smaller. Here, too, the
converse would seem to be that, the smaller
the organization, the greater the degree of
integration of supervisors with active management.

Two cases are presented which afford
comparison between a formalized plant with
staff specialization and a small factory with
a minimum of departmentalization. They
are representative of many other factories
and are not unusual in the degree of management
specialization, efficiency, or disorganization,
nor are they instances of exaggerated
union-management co-operation or
conflict. Both cases were observed in their
day-to-day operations over several months
to ascertain the actual patterns of behavior
of supervisors, union officials, and top management.

The first is a plant which is part of a network
of factories operated by a single company.
While it had only six hundred employees,
it was highly formalized, and staff functions
were well developed, so that it possessed
the organizational characteristics of
larger factories. There were five levels of supervision:
general manager, department
manager, department superintendent, foreman,
and assistant foreman. Operations
were highly mechanized, and the flow of materials
between departments required good
co-ordination. Consequently the work schedules
and techniques demanded planning and
engineering.

The rank-and-file union had a companywide
contract with local supplementary
agreements. Daily contact between union
and management occurred through the
grievance process and through a union-management
committee which met every
two weeks. Grievances supposedly started
with the foreman and passed to higher levels.
In practice the foreman usually sent a
grievance directly to his department superintendent,
since "there is no point in bothering
with something you can't do anything
about." The foremen did handle requests for
information, requisitions for equipment, and
some personal matters.

Grievances which required technical or
policy statements were passed on by department
superintendents to department managers
and then to the union-management
committee. This body included department
managers, the personnel director and occasionally
another staff head, and the union
stewards and officials. In the committee
grievances were settled and plant policies
and plans were developed and interpreted.
All union representatives had firsthand
knowledge of committee decisions and were
active participants; no foreman had ever
attended, and department superintendents
came only rarely.

The foremen entered into hiring and firing
only through the reports they made of
worker performance; the power lay in the
department superintendent and the personnel
department. The supervisors kept records
on productions and worker assignment
and had little other function.

The second example is a small factory of
seventy-five employees, run by an owner-manager
who personified the functions of
management. Rudimentary staff activities
were performed by a small clerical force
which had no real specialized authority. Supervision
below the manager was vested in
a shop manager and first-line supervisors.
Organization, policies, and communication
were less formalized than in the first case,
though the line concept was present. The
concentration of management functions in
one person not only eliminated staff departments
but reduced the amount of authority
delegated to the line.

The union-management relation was defined
in an industry-wide contract written
by the international union and a manufacturer's
association, with local supplements.
Grievances and policy discussions were
taken up by stewards and officers of the
union with the owner-manager and occasionally
with the shop manager. The supervisors
were not included in any negotiations
and were considered unimportant by both
parties. The workers and their representatives
looked on supervisors as either well-meaning
people who had no power or as
troublemakers who could be "straightened
out" by consultation with top management.

The supervisors were limited to training,
checking on work flow, reporting operating
procedures, and keeping the necessary records.
Hiring and firing and disciplinary
problems were handled by the shop manager.

Comparing these two cases, it seems that
in neither instance did the first-line supervisors
enter into decision-making. In the
larger factory managerial activity was
vested in the higher levels of supervision in
combination with the heads of various staff
units. In the small factory the concentration
of authority in one person led naturally to
the exclusion of the supervisors. In both
cases the foremen were reduced to the role of
transmitter or interpreter to the rank and file.
The significance of specialization as an element
in reducing the power of supervisors
has been fully recognized, but the concentrated
authority of the owner-manager in
small organizations has not been sufficiently
emphasized. This tendency appears to counteract
the relative absence of staff controls
and is just as effective in relegating supervisors
to a non-managerial position. The
locus of decision-making lies either in the
owner-manager (in the small enterprise) or
in a group of higher-level supervisors in the
large organizations.

In each case the contribution of the foreman
to union-management relations appears
to be a passive one. The real issues are
settled between union representatives and
higher management, and the foreman is expected
simply to conform to the joint decisions
of these representatives. In both cases,
the foreman is subject to pressure from
either union or management, but ultimately,
when agreement is reached, he must follow
the joint decision. Action by an individual
foreman, which is rejected by workers is
viewed, not as a threat to union-management
relations, but as a problem to be settled
by joint deliberation of union and management
representatives --- unless it is taken
up to illustrate a general issue. The foreman
must be viewed as the recipient of union-management
agreement or conflict rather
than as a positive contributor to union-management
relations. This passivity differs
sharply from the traditional assumption
that the foreman is an active force in determining
this relation.

In both these instances the workers were
organized. It is likely that, in cases where
the rank and file are not organized, the foreman
can play a more important role in employer-employee
affairs. In the absence of a
union, the relation between worker and
management resembles the personnel relation,
and the foreman can implement personnel
policies with considerable freedom.
Under these circumstances first-line supervision
can be of great importance in deciding
employer-employee relations. Where unionization
has occurred, however, the foreman
cannot exert much influence on the bargaining
relation, though he may implement
some personnel policies. Here he is usually
limited by the direct activity of the personnel
department.

Since the general pattern of union-management
relations, and in many cases the
day-to-day differences, are settled by top
management without the inclusion of first-line
supervisors, it seems that it is entirely
erroneous to view the foreman as the "key
man" in this relation. He is rather a person
who enters secondarily as the implementor
of policies which have already been decided,
and his success or failure depends on his
ability to act on them, instead of on his own
positive actions. Any deviation from union-management
decisions will bring forth censure
from one or both sides, but in no case
can the supervisor himself enter into the
formulation of the rules under which he
works. This activity is vested in the union
officials and higher management. The supervisor
gets criticism from both management
and union, but he is pushed aside when
decisions are to be made.

It is also important to note that in larger
organizations the decision-making function
tends to reside, not in any line supervisor
but in a group of persons representing the
various specialized functions of management.
In many cases this entire group meets
when union-management negotiations are to
take place. The simple unitary line breaks
down and is replaced by a committee type
of organization. This same tendency has
been noted at the foreman level and was deliberately
arranged by Fayol in his famous
experiment with "functional foremen."
First-level supervision still in most cases requires
the co-ordination of several functions;
this is more effectively and efficiently
accomplished by one person than by several.
However, it is questionable whether the
functions which are so correlated are any
more important than those which might be
delegated to any minor staff employee. In
many instances it seems that the lowest
line supervisor is of no greater importance
than many staff members; in other words,
the first level of supervision is no longer a
position of special importance.

This discussion suggests that neither the
conception of the foreman which insists that
he is an integral part of the "line," nor the
suggestive phrase, "the man in the middle,"
indicates accurately the nature of the difficulties
of his position. The foreman, as is
shown in these two instances, is less than a
full member of the management line; he
shares with those higher up the responsibility
for carrying out policies but does not
share in the making of them. Furthermore,
his position differs from theirs in that those
higher up give orders to people who are
identified with management, while the essence
of the foreman's job is that he must
transmit them to people who are clearly not
of management. In short, the position of
foreman has some of the characteristics of
management positions but lacks other crucial
ones. Such marginal positions are common
in society, and there is reason to believe
that they are especially difficult to occupy
effectively and with peace of mind. With
respect to management, the foreman's position
is peripheral rather than in the middle.
The poor fellow is in the middle, of course, in
the sense that a person may be the middle
one of three in a bed; he gets it from both
sides!

It is characteristic of such marginal positions
that the people who occupy them consider
that they are special victims of the
disparity between social norms and social
reality. Foremen express this in the phrase,
"They say we are part of management, but
they don't treat us that way." The implication
is that they feel pressed to live up to the
role of members of management, without
being given the reward of full participation.
This is a common feeling of people in "minority"
or "marginal" positions. It presents
them with a dilemma which results in a good
deal of personal conflict. Sometimes they
attempt to solve the conflict, individually or
collectively, by defiantly adopting an alternative
role; in the case of the foreman, that
of the worker who may organize a union for
bargaining with management. In at least
one instance known to me the presentation
to foremen of a training course was an important
factor in precipitating the organization
of a foremen's union. The course
emphasized their importance to and identification
with management, thereby sharpening
the foremen's consciousness of the cleavage
between the expected norm held before
them and the realities of their experience.
