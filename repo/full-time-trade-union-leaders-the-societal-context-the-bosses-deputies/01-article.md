The weakness of the contemporary
trade union movement is
mostly attributed to the introduction
of economic reforms and
new labor practices of the post-liberalization
era. This, however,
neglects the role of the trade
union leaders and the social milieu
in which they functioned.
Based on a micro-level study of
full-time trade union leaders of
the pre-liberal period of Baroda
city, Gujarat, this paper argues:
(i) the social milieu constricted
the influence of full-time leaders
and (ii) the trade union leadership
constituted an influence
structure, consisting of a hierarchy
of leaders designated as
'Bosses' and 'Deputies'.

# Introduction

In the post-liberal India the triumph
of capital over labor, as indicated by the
introduction of several anti-labor practices,
has weakened the once powerful
trade union movement and worsened the
socio-economic conditions of working
class (Sheth, 1993; Sodhi, 2014). According
to the World Labor Report 1997--98
of the ILO the trade union membership
in India as a percentage of non-agricultural
labor slumped from 6.6 percent in
1985 to 5.5 percent in 1995, and union
membership as a percentage of formal
sector workers dropped from 26.5 percent
to 22.8 percent (Bhattacharjee,
1999: 31, 2001:259).

Albeit, Indian trade union movement
was never revolutionary, however, it was
acquiring some momentum before the liberalization,
as the number of strikes more
than doubled between 1961 and 1974 at
all-India level (Ahn, 2010:39). Indeed, in
the post-liberal era also there have been
a number of nation-wide strikes, demonstrations,
and struggles protesting against
neo-liberal policies of the government.
But most of them were in the public sector
units and were unsuccessful (Shyam
Sundar, 2010: 589--95; 2015). Moreover,
the industrial disputes since mid-1990's
largely involved individual, isolated, and
independent plant-level unions and on the
whole the unions' bargaining power has
declined after liberalization (Chakrabarty
& Dhar, 2008:73).

Why the Indian trade union movement,
which was so powerful before the
economic reforms (Ramaswamy, 1988;
Sodhi, 2013: 175; Titlebaum, 2009), succumbed
to the forces of liberalization,
privatization, and globalization without
posing a serious challenge? Mostly, this
post-liberal docility of the Indian trade
unions is attributed to the introduction of
new labor practices such as recruitment-freeze,
outsourcing, increasing use of
contract workers, freedom to hire and
fire, liberty to close industrial undertakings,
soft labor inspection system, permissiveness
to introduce labor saving
technologies, repeal of legal provisions
regarding bonus, 'voluntary retirement
schemes' (VRS), and privatization of nonviable
public enterprises. This paper examines
the conundrum by focusing on the
role of full-time trade union leaders, also
known as 'outsiders', in the pre-liberal
era.

# Full-time Trade Union Leaders

Leadership is important in the trade
union movement across the world. However,
the distinguishing feature of the Indian
trade union movement has been the
two broad types of leaders, namely, 'outsiders'
and 'insiders'. Those who initiated
and developed the movement in India were
not regular factory workers or employees.
Instead, they were social workers or politicians
who became full-time trade union
leaders and were financially supported by
their unions. Such leaders are generally
known as 'outsiders', and are usually associated
with one or the other national
federation of the trade unions, functioning
under the umbrella of a political party.
The dominance of these politically oriented
outsiders over the trade union movement
in India has been a much discussed issue
(Karnik, 1978; Ramaswamy, 1973; 1974;
1977; Rothemund, 1981).

> The Indian trade union movement
before liberalization was very
much vibrant, aggressive, and politically
quite influential.

Many critical observers maintain that
the outside leaders were responsible for
the politicization of the movement, multiple
unions, inter-union rivalry, and other
such debilitating consequences (Shyam
Sundar, 2008: 168--69). Such critics, however,
generally underplay the fact that
despite all its limitations, the Indian trade
union movement before liberalization was
very much vibrant, aggressive, and politically
quite influential (Ramaswamy, 1988;
Titlebaum, 2009). Moreover, they also
ignore the constricting role of the sociopolitical
milieu on the trade union leadership
evident at a micro-level, which is the
actual arena of industrial relations. This
paper, therefore, examines the role of fulltime
trade union leaders at the grass roots
level, with reference to Baroda (now
Vadodara), an industrial city of Gujarat,
and highlights the curbing impact of the
pre-liberal socio-political context on their
leadership role. To focus sharply on the
leadership role performed by the outsiders
and its bearing on the trade union
movement at the grassroots level, the paper
underscores the internal differentiation
found among them, by highlighting two
main strata among them, namely, 'Bosses'
and 'Deputies'. This distinction between
the bosses and the deputies not only accentuates
the societal constraints but also
illuminates Robert Merton's conception of
the influence structure, which implies not
only a hierarchy of leaders but also a chain
of influence (Merton, 1968:441--74).

# The Context

The trade union movement of Baroda
city, as elsewhere, has been shaped by a
constellation of historical, socio-political,
and economic forces. Although, the industrialization
began by the late 19^th^ century
in the city, it did not flourish till the
1930s, when the city could boast of several
factories apart from a few services.
The city's working class was nebulous
but the economic hardships caused by the
First World War, and mobilization of the
industrial workers elsewhere in India,
stimulated the working-class movement
in the city. In the early phase until the
Independence, the working class movement
in Baroda was confined mainly to
its textile workers, organized by the Majur
Mahajan, a trade union formed by the
Gandhians committed to the ideology of
industrial peace and class collaboration.[^1]
Albeit, the communists, believing in class
conflict, also attempted to unionize the
workers of the city, under the _Lal Vavta_
(Red Flag) banner, their influence was
limited (Patel, 2011). Immediately after
Independence, two major trade union
federations were active in the city,
namely, All India Trade Union Congress
(AITUC) of the communists and the
newly formed Indian National Trade
Union Congress (INTUC) of the Indian
National Congress, with which the Majur
Mahajan was affiliated. Later, in the post-Independence
period, with the increasing
industrialization the non-textile sector
was enlarged. Consequently, the non-textile
and white-collar workers were
also increasingly unionized. During the
late 1960s Indian polity was fractured
causing a division of the then dominant
Congress Party and a split in the Communist
Party of India. Consequently, several
national federations of the trade
unions, formed by various political parties
came into existence, in addition to
the already existing AITUC and INTUC,
such as Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS),
Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU),
Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS), and National
Labor Organization (NLO)
(Karnik, 1978).[^2] These federations set up
their branches all over the country, including
Baroda. Thus, by the early 1980s the
city had 64 trade unions, affiliated with
the local branches of the six national federations.
Of these six national federations,
Majur Mahajan, now affiliated with
the NLO, had a monopoly hold over the
textile workers, who constituted the bulk
of the city's working class; having a very
limited influence on the non-textile workers.
The remaining five federations, having
negligible influence on the textile
workers, concentrated on organizing the
non-textile workers. The non-textile
workers, mostly employed in small or
medium sized units, were scattered in
multitude of units dispersed all over the
city and its periphery. Therefore, their
unions were relatively small, having limited
resources. The competition among
all the six federations to organize the non-textile
workers augmented industrial conflicts
and fragmented the movement due
to the inter-union rivalry.

# The Societal Milieu

The leaders do not function in social
vacuum. Local socio-political culture of a
city or region and macro level developments,
significantly shape the configuration
of industrial relations (Ramaswami,
1988). The social environment of Gujarat
and India was characterized by: (i) competitive
democratic polity and (ii) underdeveloped
economy. The former promoted
multi-party democracy, generating intense
competition for political power, and politicizing
almost all spheres of the society,
including the trade union movement, and
the latter determined the main goal of Indian
society as economic development,
social justice, and industrial peace.[^3] While
politicization of the labor movement
caused by competitive polity resulted in
inter-federation rivalry and the consequent
fragmentation of the movement
(Ramaswamy, 1971; 1972; 1973), the
state-centric legal framework empowered
the state to frequently intervene in the disputes
between the labor and capital, weakening
thereby collective bargaining process
(Mitchell, Mahy & Gahan, 2014,
Chaudhury, 1996: 8--20; Hill 2009: 396--400).
The societal milieu of Gujarat in
general, and Baroda in particular, in which
the leaders functioned, is examined here
by focusing on (1) socio-political culture,
and (ii) the legal framework.

# The Socio-Political Culture

Ostensibly, the short-term goal of the
different federations was common,
namely, to solve the immediate work-and-wage
related problems of the workers.
However, all these federations legitimized
their separate existence by articulating
their long-term goals expressed in their
respective political ideologies, ranging
from Marxist (AITUC-CITU) to Socialist
(HMS) to Gandhian (INTUC-Majur
Nahajan/NLO) to Rightist-Nationalist
(BMS). Besides, the 'Mahajani-Gandhian'
socio-political culture of
Gujarat, (Sheth, 2003), moderated the
industrial relations, by emphasizing pragmatism,
reconciliation, and class collaboration
rather than class conflict, distinctively
influencing the state's trade union
movement. The influence of this culture
on the state's polity was manifested in
the dominance of the Congress Party
from 1960 [^4] through early 1970s, and also
on the trade union movement, as the
Gandhian trade union, Majur Mahajan
(INTUC/NLO), politically aligned to the
Gujarat Congress, dominated the labor
scene of Gujarat during this period. Conversely,
the non-Gandhian trade union
federations such as AITUC, BMS, CITU,
and HMS, formed by other political parties,
remained relatively weak. Not surprisingly,
the industrial relations in Gujarat
were relatively peaceful almost up to the
early 1970s. By the late 1970s, however,
with the simultaneous decline of Congress
Party, Majur Mahajan, and 'Mahjani-Gandhian'
culture in Gujarat the number
of industrial disputes increased.[^5]

>The non-Gandhian trade union federations
such as AITUC, BMS,
CITU, and HMS, formed by other
political parties, remained relatively
weak.

# The Legal Framework

Legal framework of Gujarat trade
unions mainly consisted of the following
three laws: (i) Indian Trade Union Act,
1926, (ii) The Bombay Industrial Relations
Act, 1946, and (iii) Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947.

_Trade Union Act (TU), 1926_: The
TU Act, 1926, under Section 4, permits
registration of workers' unions and associations
of employers for collective
bargaining as minimum seven workers
(or seven employees) can form a trade
union and apply for its registration. This
provision thus allows small, unviable, and
multiple unions in a plant. Moreover, under
Section 22 of the Act, at least 50
percent office-bearers of a union should
be actually engaged or employed in the
industry with which the trade union is
concerned; the remaining 50 percent or
less can be outsiders, such as lawyers,
politicians, or social workers. Clearly,
this provision allows the dominance of
the outside leaders. The dominance of
the outside leaders in Baroda city is reflected
in the fact that only 25 full-time,
paid, outside, trade union leaders held
147 of total 424 positions such as President,
General Secretary, Secretary or
Treasurer in the Executive Committees
of the 64 trade unions, affiliated with the
six federations. On an average, these
25 outside leaders held nearly six positions
each. Thus, only 6 per cent officeholders
occupied 35 percent offices. It
was also common to find an outside
leader holding the same office in all the
unions of his federation. For instance,
the late Murlidhar Ranalkar (HMS) was
popularly known as _Mantri_ (Secretary)
among the members of the HMS unions,
since he held the same position in all
those unions. Evidently, power was concentrated
in the hands of those outside
leaders.[^6] _Table 1_ gives a classification
of the 25 full timers of the 64 trade
unions and their federations.

: _Table 1_: Total Number of Unions & Outside Full-timers Associated with Six Federations

_Bombay Industrial Relations
(B.I.R.) Act, 1946_: The B.I.R. Act, applicable
to specified industries such as
textiles, co-operative banks, sugar, power
generation, etc. mainly in Gujarat and
Maharashtra states, also considerably
influenced the trade unions of the region.
This Act prescribes recognition of a 'representative
union' as the sole bargaining
agent for an industry, in a specified local
area. The Act also provides for statutory
machinery to resolve industrial disputes
through negotiation, conciliation, or arbitration
by Labor Courts, Industrial Courts,
or Wage Boards. It restricts strikes so
severely that a 'legal' strike is virtually
impossible in the industries covered under
this Act (Bhattacharjee, 1989: M.70--1). Under this Act Majur Mahajan was
recognized as the sole bargaining agent
in the textile industry of Baroda city and
the whole state. Hence, the Majur
Mahajan had almost monopoly control
over the major industry. This had two
consequences:

(a) Majur Mahajan
emerged as numerically strongest and
financially affluent federation in Baroda
city, as elsewhere in Gujarat, and

(b) the
entire textile industry remained free from
multiple trade unions, inter-union rivalry,
and industrial conflict.

_The Industrial Disputes (I.D.) Act,
1947_: Unlike the B.I.R. Act, which is
applicable mainly to Gujarat and
Maharashtra states, the I.D. Act is applicable
all over the country to all the
other industries not included under the
former. The principal object of I.D. Act
is also to secure industrial peace by providing
machinery for settlement of industrial
disputes through collective bargaining,
conciliation, and adjudication. Significantly,
the I.D. Act, unlike the B.I.R. Act,
does not have a provision for a 'representative
union' to be recognized as the
sole bargaining agent of employees
across an industry or a particular region.
Consequently, multiplicity of trade unions
and inter-union rivalry were rampant in
the industries covered under the Act, promoting
small, unstable, and almost fragile
trade unions. The Act also enhanced
politicization of the movement, as it empowered
the government to intervene in
industrial relations (Bhattacharjee, 2001,
Chaudhuri, 1996:12, Kennedy: 1966). Influence
of the milieu was visible on the
trade union leadership of Gujarat, making
it a challenging and strenuous job.

> Multiplicity of trade unions and
inter-union rivalry were rampant in
the industries covered under the
Act, promoting small, unstable,
and almost fragile trade unions.

# Inadequate Monetary Rewards

Since most of the trade unions formed
in the non-textile industries were small
and financially weak, the honorarium paid
to their full-timers was inadequate for a
comfortable living. The Majur Mahajan,
having absolute control over the textile
workers of the city, was the only federation
paying graded salary to its full-timers,
regularly, with the benefits of provident
fund and gratuity. Nevertheless, their
monthly salary was much lower, in comparison
to some of their well-paid followers.
For instance, the head of the federation
was paid about 750 rupees per
month, which was much less than a
jobber's salary in a textile mill. Therefore,
one leader of the federation sarcastically
remarked, "_Hum to jobber se bhi
gaye_" (We are worse than the jobbers).[^7]

Unsurprisingly, no leader of Majur
Mahajan felt that his honorarium was
adequate. In comparison to Majur
Mahajan, the leaders of the other federations
got meager honorarium, which
was not even paid regularly. Mostly, they
survived on the subsistence level, supported
by their family members' income,
as illustrated by the following excerpts
from the interviews.

AITUC Leader said: "I earn about
400 rupees as monthly honorarium from
my unions. My wife works as a midwife,
earning about 300 rupees per month. Thus,
our total monthly income is about 700 rupees,
which is insufficient for my family
of six members."

INTUC Leader: "When
I left my job in 1976 to join the INTUC as
a full-timer, my monthly income was more
than 1000 rupees. Now, I get about 250
rupees as monthly honorarium from
INTUC. Additionally, I get 100 rupees per
individual case of the workers when I represent
them in the labor court. Still, until
recently, I had to do a part-time job in a
firm earning monthly 100 rupees, which I
stopped as my wife has now started working.
Thus, my total monthly income is
around 500--600 rupees. I have seven
members in my family. Frankly speaking,
it is impossible to make two ends meet."

Actually, some leaders were qualified
to have better-paid jobs than the
trade union work they were doing. For
instance, the INTUC's leader who made
the above statement was holding an M.A.
degree. Likewise, the head of Majur
Mahajan had an M. A. degree and a
Bachelor's degree in law, and the leader
of HMS was a science graduate and had
undergone a short training course in labor
relations at Harvard University, USA.

# Irregular Working Hours & Disorganized Personal Life

The leaders' personal lives were
highly disorganized. Their followers often
bothered them any time at any place.
Without fixed hours of working they
could not enjoy holidays or pay enough
attention to their families. Still worse, if
the workers felt that their problems were
not solved satisfactorily they would blame
their leaders, often making wild allegations
against them. Some leaders, therefore,
complained that the workers treated
them as their '_Naukars_' (servants).

Not surprisingly, most leaders considered
their job as thankless. It is, however,
amazing that despite all these difficulties,
they had displayed a life-long
commitment to the cause, as some of
them continued to work in the field for
more than 30--40 years. The perplexing
question, therefore, is: What was the
motive force behind their commitment to
their role as trade union leaders?

# Non-Monetary Rewards

Most of them took their work as a
mission, considering the personal satisfaction
of doing some altruistic work as
their main reward, Besides, even though
they did not get sufficient monetary reward,
they acquired respect in society,
motivating them to continue their work.
For instance, the INTUC leader said: "Financially
my position is not sound and yet
I am elected as Joint-Secretary of Baroda
City Congress (I/R), much against the
wish of many powerful persons of the city,
only because of my trade union work.
Similarly, some of us got elected as municipal
corporators or as members to the
state legislative assembly (MLA), and one
of us (a leader of the HMS) could become
a Minister in the Government of Gujarat,
mainly because of the trade union background."
Indeed, when a trade union
leader got elected as a municipal corporator
or as a member of the state legislative
assembly (MLA) his sphere of influence
and recognition expanded, along with
his capacity to help his workers. Thus,
the intrinsic reward in the form of satisfaction
of doing some philanthropic work
and the extrinsic rewards such as social
status, prestige, and political prominence,
appear to be the main stimulants behind
their trade union activities.

# The Bosses & Deputies

Mostly, the full-time outside leaders
are considered as a homogenous category;
their internal differentiations are
rarely noticed. In reality, however, a detailed
scrutiny of these leaders demonstrates
that the full-timers differ significantly
in the sphere of their influence, in
their social background, and in their role
performance.

The heads of the city branches of
their federations can be legitimately defined
as the 'Bosses'. Generally, their
unions and federations were known by
their personal names. For instance, all the
unions of Majur Mahajan were known in
the city as Dahyabhai's unions, as he was
the head of Majur Mahajan. Similarly, the
unions of HMS were known mostly as
Sanat Mehta's unions. Likewise, the
BMS unions were known as Keshubhai
Thakkar's unions, and the AITUC unions
as Bhalchandra Trivedi's unions. These
local bosses directed all the activities of
their unions and acted as their spokesmen.
Policy statements or press notes
about their unions or federations were
issued in their names. These bosses represented
their respective federations
while interacting with the government
officers such as the collector or city police
head or in important city-level meetings
of all federations, for some joint action.
They were also involved in other
political or civic organizations. Dahyabhai
Patel, the boss of Majur Mahajan, for
instance, was a member of the senate
(court) and syndicate (executive council)
of the The Maharaja Sayajirao University
of Baroda, and also a member of
the governing board of Baroda Productivity
Council, a powerful non-government
organization, for a long period. Besides,
they were also involved in the state
or national level councils of their respective
federations or political parties, and
some held important offices in such councils.
For instance, Keshubhai Thakkar, the
boss of BMS, was the President of the
Gujarat unit of BMS of which he was
formerly the General Secretary. Similarly,
Bhalchandra Trivedi, the AITUC boss,
was the General Secretary of the Gujarat
Council of AITUC and a member of its
national executive. He was a Joint Secretary
of the Gujarat Council of the Communist
Party of India and the Secretary
of its cell in Baroda district. He contested
elections twice for the membership in the
Gujarat state legislative assembly, though
unsuccessfully. He visited the former
USSR and former German Democratic
Republic (GDR) as a representative of
the AITUC. Likewise, Sanat Mehta, the
HMS boss, was a prominent municipal
corporator, and was elected as a local
MLA, becoming cabinet minister, twice
in the Government of Gujarat. He was
later appointed Chairman of Sardar
Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd. of the
Government of Gujarat in early 1990s,
and was also elected to Lok Sabha in
1996, acquiring considerable eminence
both at the state and the national levels.
Thus, the influence of the bosses invariably
extended beyond the city, to the state
level, and in some instances, even to the
national level. On the other hand, the
deputies had limited influence only within
the city, as two of them could become
corporators in the Baroda Municipality.
Since each federation had only one head,
the bosses were in smaller number, in
comparison to their deputies, as indicated
by _Table 2_.

> The influence of the bosses invariably
extended beyond the city, to
the state level, and in some instances,
even to the national level.

# The Socio-political Profiles

_Table 3_ gives an overview of the
socio-political profile of the bosses and
deputies.

Since Baroda has been a Hindu dominated
city, the bosses and deputies were
mostly Guajarati Hindus. One deputy,
however, was a Malayali, and a couple
was Marathi-speaking. All these leaders
were males. In terms of caste, except
one, all the bosses were from high castes,
whereas half the deputies belonged to
the middle or lower castes. The bosses
were relatively older, had joined the
movement at an early stage, and were,
therefore, more experienced. More than
half of the bosses (i.e., four out of six)
did not have any previous employment
experience. Their deputies, however,
were relatively younger, late joiners, and
recruited mainly from the working class
background.

: _Table 2_: The Number Unions & the Number of Bosses & Deputies in Each Federation

_Note: The bosses were invariably the presidents of the unions, and the deputies were general secretaries or secretaries or joint secretaries or treasures._

The bosses were relatively better
educated; five were graduates, two having
a post-graduate degree. On the other
hand, all the five leaders with only
school-level education were the deputies.
Politically, the bosses were more
prominent than their deputies; all the six
bosses had contested state or national
level elections, while only four deputies
had done so.

The bosses and the deputies performed
several activities, having a division
of work and differential location in
the influence structure.

# Main Role of the Boss

Resolving collective disputes regarding
wage revision was an important activity
of the leaders, since a trade union
has to enter into a periodic contract on
behalf of the workers with their employers.
Before entering into such a contract
the leaders had to do some groundwork,
to assess the aspirations of the workers,
and then to translate them into specific
demands. The next task before them was
to assign priority to these demands, keeping
in view the employers' capacity and
willingness to grant them. This role, being
strategic and complicated, was performed
only by the bosses. The INTUC boss
stated: "By and large, we define certain
demands as the main demands, and then
we add a few extra demands with a clear
understanding with our workers that the
latter would be withdrawn in favor of the
former at the time of negotiations so that
there is some room for bargaining between
us and the management."

: _Table 3_: Classification of Bosses & Deputies According to a Few Selected Background Variables

The AITUC boss highlighted difficulties
involved in the process: "Most of the
workers do not know their own salary
grade, basic wages, other allowances,
past pay-revisions, and so forth. The
management would not oblige us by providing
the information. Some of the
workers having such data may not have
sufficient evidence to support their
claims. If, after some efforts, we locate
a worker with the necessary information
and sufficient proofs, he may not be willing
to share the same, due to the fear of
victimization by the management. But,
what is more difficult is to persuade all
the workers to arrive at some consensus
upon demands. If the workers agree, then
the management would not. Many management
personnel refuse to cooperate.
The inevitable result is litigation. Some
of the employers would not even accept
the labor court's verdict and go up to the
Supreme Court. Thus, it is a prolonged
process."

# Main Role of the Deputies

Many workers confront individual
problems in their plants such as the disciplinary
actions taken against them in the
form of charge-sheets, or suspension/dismissal
orders, or lay-off/retrenchment
notices. Some workers also faced problems
related to provident fund, gratuity,
leave, promotion, Employment State Insurance
(ESI) Scheme, accident benefits,
and so on. These individual disputes were
the life-line of any trade union. Some
leaders complained that many workers
came to them only for such problems.
Otherwise, they avoided even becoming
the members of the union. Technically,
however, a union is supposed to take up
such problems only of their members.
But, no union could afford to refuse to
serve the non-members. Otherwise, they
feared, such workers would join the rival
union. Therefore, such non-members
having individual grievances were usually
asked to pay the union fees for the
whole year, plus the lump sum litigation
charges ranging from 25 rupees to 250
rupees, depending upon the complication
of the case. Besides, in some instances,
they were also asked to contribute to the
union a certain percentage of the benefits
earned by them, after winning the
case, due to the efforts of the union leaders.

> Individual problems were mostly
handled by the deputies.

Individual problems were mostly
handled by the deputies, as 12 of them
reported that they spent most of their time
only in solving such problems. The bosses
were rarely involved in such disputes, if
the disputes were routine. The solution
of the individual problems, however, also
entailed a complicated process. Some of
them were solved at the negotiation level,
but most involved litigation. Even when
a dispute reached the adjudication level,
efforts were made to arrive at a compromise.
Generally, in the cases of suspension
or dismissal, both the union and
the management would take an uncompromising
stand. Because, in some cases
such suspended or dismissed workers
would be leading union activists, and,
therefore, no union liked to 'sacrifice'
their 'loyalists'. On the contrary, the
management would not like to be soft
with those workers, because they
dreaded that such spongy approach could
dilute the management's authority and set
a bad precedent. Therefore, the litigation
concerning such workers would drag on
for quite some time. Consequent delay
in the judgment would make some of
these workers restless and compel them
to compromise with the management,
often against the wish of their leaders.
As most of the victims would find alternative
jobs for survival, during the suspension
period, they would hesitate to
revert to their previous employer, due to
the strained relationship. Paradoxically,
a lump sum which they hoped to get in
the form of provident fund, gratuity, and
other arrears due to the settlement, provided
them an additional incentive to rush
for a compromise. The technical workers
who were in much demand and had
high wages (and, therefore, also attractive
arrears) were more likely to do so.
The INTUC deputy said: "These workers
often come and tell us: '_Hamara 'Final'
Karo, Hum Jata Hai_' (Settle my
dispute, I want to quit). Managements
would also happily cooperate to compromise,
since they get rid of such disgruntled,
'union-minded' workers. Actually,
they would 'trap' such 'union-minded'
workers and then compel them
to leave the job, first by provoking them
through suspension notice or charge-sheet,
and then tempting them by offering
'handsome' amounts in the form of
notice-pay and other dues if they resign
voluntarily. The management would also
coax them to resign, by telling them that
if they resign they would easily get another
job, which would not be the case if
they were dismissed. As a result, some
of these workers would resign even before
consulting us. Unfortunately, some
of them are our own representatives."

# Commonly Shared Activities

Some other activities, mentioned below,
were shared by both the bosses and
the deputies.

(i) _Workers' Domestic Problems_: Several leaders helped the workers in
solving their domestic problems, such
as the problems regarding illness,
hospitalization, police or court cases,
employment for their relatives, getting
documents attested by appropriate
legal authorities, and so forth.
Five bosses and four deputies stated
that they spent some time in helping
the workers in such matters. Two
deputies who helped the workers in
such problems were municipal corporators.

(ii) _Welfare Activities for Workers_:
Although all the federations claimed
to have the overall welfare of the
workers as their long-term goal, very
few leaders spent time in welfare
activities. Only two bosses and five
deputies used to spend some time on
welfare activities. One boss belonged
to Majur Mahajan and the other belonged
to HMS. From among the
deputies four belonged to Mahajan
and the remaining one to HMS. Of
the six federations, only these two
federations had undertaken some
welfare activities for their members.
HMS, devoted to the socialist ideology,
had initially organized a few cooperative
societies of the workers for
different purposes, but became inactive
later. Thus, Majur Mahajan was
the only federation which had a long
tradition of welfare activities for its
workers, due to its sound financial
position as well as the Gandhian ideology.
The leaders of other federations
could not undertake such activities,
as they did not have enough
resources. They could not even publish
news-bulletins for the lack of resources.
Except Majur Mahajan, no
other federation was able to publish
its news-bulletin regularly. The HMS
used to publish a fortnightly, but later
it was discontinued.

(iii) _Workers' Education_: No leader
made any direct effort to educate the
workers in the ideology of their respective
federations by conducting
regular study circles. Only three
bosses and three deputies spent some
time in conducting workers' education
classes in collaboration with the
Workers' Education Board of Government
of India. But, those were
routine government-sponsored training
classes in trade unionism, which
had nothing do with their respective
political ideologies.

(iv) _Political Socialization_: Nevertheless,
their ideological pursuits were
reflected in their talks and discussions
with the workers while solving their
individual or collective problems, and
also in their public speeches on various
occasions, including the gate
meetings. The Mahajan (NLO) leaders,
for example, invariably invoked
Mahatma Gandhi's name in their
talks, and emphasized the values of
peace and non-violence. The INTUC
leaders highlighted _garibi hatao_ (removal
of poverty) and the progressive
policies of Mrs. Indira Gandhi,
then leader of Congress (I/R). The
BMS leaders used nationalistic sentiments,
and appealed in the name of
the nation and _Bharat Mata_ (Mother
India). The HMS leaders talked in
terms of socialism and social justice.
In contrast, the AITUC and CITU
leaders, following radical leftist ideologies,
discussed issues couched in
the ideology of working class unity,
class conflict, and class struggles.
Moreover, their ideological commitments
were also reflected in the selection
of ideologically committed
workers for being promoted to trade
union leadership.

Also, both the bosses and deputies
actively participated in the programs of
the political parties with which their respective
federations were associated and
mobilized their followers from among the
workers for several activities such as
joining the processions, shouting slogans,
carrying banners, distributing union's
pamphlets, and pasting posters or painting
slogans on the city walls. Further,
the deputies and bosses also mobilized
support of their workers for each other
when they contested public elections.
However, in such activities, the bosses
would always remain in the forefront and
the deputies would perform peripheral
roles.

# The Influence Structure

The distinction between the bosses
and the deputies does not have merely
taxonomical value, since the trade union
leadership constitutes, what Merton calls,
an influence structure, consisting of both
the status hierarchy and flow of influence
(Merton, 1968:441--74). The bosses were
the top leaders of their respective federations.
And the deputies intimately interacted
with the bosses of their respective
federations on a day-to-day basis on
the one hand, and were also in close contact
with the workers, on the other. Thus
they were a crucial link between the
bosses and the rank and file in the chain
of influence. The messages flew downwards
from the bosses to the workers
and upward from the workers to the
bosses, through the deputies. This is reflected
in various activities of the trade
union leaders requiring them to spend their
time at different places such as (i) federation
office, and (ii) factory.

(i) _The Federation Office_: Almost all
these leaders spent most of their
time in their federation's office,
since it was the most convenient
meeting place for all concerned.
Both the bosses and deputies attended
their federation offices regularly
in the mornings (9 a.m. to 12.30
p.m.) and in the evenings (5 p.m. to
9 p.m.). In the federation office, the
deputies would be busy listening to
individual or collective grievances of
workers. And the bosses would be
drafting correspondence, including
replies to charge-sheets given to the
workers and similar legal disputes or
conducting workers' meetings. During
this time the bosses and the deputies
would constantly interact with
each other, mostly the deputies
seeking guidance from the bosses
and receiving instructions from them
on various issues and transmitting
the same to the workers. For the
rest of the day, they would usually
be busy visiting the factories or pursuing
legal disputes, either at the
conciliation office or at the labor
courts.

(ii) _Factories and Conciliation or Adjudication
Machinery_: All the leaders
spent considerable time at the
factories. Generally, the bosses attended
negotiations at factory and
deputies either accompanied them or
looked after conciliation or legal matters.
Interestingly, all the leaders did
not visit the factories necessarily for
negotiations with the managements.
Often they went to the factories for
addressing gate-meetings (the meetings
held at the factory gate at the
time of the change of shifts) and organizing
other agitation activities. In
the gate-meetings or agitation programs
also the bosses would be more
prominent mostly giving speeches
and the deputies would look after the
organizational or mobilization work as
per the instructions of their bosses.
The leaders of Majur Mahajan, however,
hardly ever held gate-meetings,
spending most of the time at factory
for negotiations, since they had a long
tradition of harmonious relations with
the managements due to their commitment
to the Gandhian ideology of
industrial peace.

The workers were also aware about
the division of work among the bosses
and deputies. Whenever they had any
problem, initially they would approach the
deputies, who were, not only easily available
but also closer to them in terms of
social status, since the deputies came
from working class background. Thus the
deputies constituted a crucial link between
the bosses and the rank and file
workers. As Merton (1968:466) has suggested,
these persons in the adjacent
strata of influence, who constitute a chain
of influence, can be of critical significance
for the flow of opinions, views, etc.
from top to bottom and vice versa.

>The deputies constituted a crucial
link between the bosses and the
rank and file workers.

# Concluding Remarks

The foregoing analysis reveals that the
trade union movement was mostly a function
of (i) the specific socio-political milieu,
and (ii) the state-centric legal framework,
obsessed with industrial peace. The full-timers
were too few to confront the gigantic
challenges entailed in their task. The
multiplicity of the unions and federations,
caused by competitive polity and encouraged
by the legal framework, disallowed
the unions to be financially strong enough
to recruit many full-timers, and also compelled
the leaders to pay more attention to
legalistic and bureaucratic activities, overlooking
the cause of building a powerful
working class movement. Unsurprisingly,
they could inspire their unions to resist the
introduction of anti-labor practices. Even
so, despite their small number, the outsiders
worked with remarkable zeal at the
grass roots level, under daunting circumstances,
dividing their work between the
bosses and deputies. The two strata not
only reveal a leadership hierarchy but also
a chain of influence.

[^1]: The Majur Mahajan, also known as the Textile
Labor Association (TLA), was affiliated to INTUC
formed by the Indian National Congress,
immediately after the latter's formation in 1947.

[^2]: In the late 1960s, the Indian National Congress
was divided into two parties. One was Congress
(I) popularly known as Indira Congress, later
known as the Ruling Congress or Congress (R). In
this paper it is referred to as Congress (I/R). Another
was Congress O-or the Organizational Congress,
loyal to the opponents of Indira Gandhi. After the
split in Congress INTUC, excluding Majur Mahajan
of Gujarat, remained loyal to the Congress (I/R).
Congress (O) formed a new federation, namely,
National Labor Organization (NLO) in 1972, and
the Majur Mahajan became its fulcrum.
Thus, Majur Mahajan was with INTUC up to 1971,
