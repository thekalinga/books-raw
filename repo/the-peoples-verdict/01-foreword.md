# FOREWORD

Our Constitutional order sustains itself on the peaceful coexistence
of different communities and active fellowship of faiths.
Religious pluralism is a pervasive feature of our demography and
secular perspective is a basic doctrine of our democracy. Our
founding fathers have wisely made it a categorical imperative of our
polity that every citizen, be he/she of any religion or denomination or
none, shall have full title to all the fundamental rights in abundant
equality and easy accessibility. But it is terrible to think that communal
tension, confrontation and conflagration have more than once marred
the orderly process of national life. And when communal clashes go
up in flames somewhere, they spread like wildfire everywhere,
because the State and those in the administration entrusted with the
responsibility of societal welfare and law and order, fail in their official
duty and betray political bankruptcy.

> The administration
failed in its first
obligation of giving
people the right to
life, which is the
foremost human
right.

This prefatory observation is too moderate a caution or criticism
when we recall the utter collapse of the
State apparatus in its foremost responsibility
of keeping the peace of the Republic in the
recent past. The Mandir-Masjid controversy,
without going into the merits of this
pathological issue, has been aggravating
social frictions and fomenting frequent
explosions between two communities, viz.
Hindus and Muslims. On the 6th of
December, the Babri Masjid was demolished by politico-communal
miscreants of the Hindu fold, inevitably igniting a burst of pent-up
emotions from the Muslim sector in many places. Bombay and Surat,
among other cities, towns and villages of India, lost their tranquillity.
Scenes of trauma ensued, leaving trails of blood and burning and
streams of tears, the like of which Bombay and Surat had never seen
before. Immediately after the 6th of December and the destruction of
the Masjid, terror stalked tense streets in Bombay. The administration
failed in its first obligation of giving people the right to life, which is
the foremost human right. I do no autopsy of the flaws and flops of
any instrumentalities, party or community here, as it is unfolded in the
report that follows.

The second episode happened in January and wreaked more
havoc than the first and the inaction of the administration was more
indefensible as the circumstances on inquiry revealed. The lives lost,
the damage to property done, the scare spread and the refugee trek
triggered, made megapolitan Bombay a scenario of blood, sweat, toil
and tears. Victims of this man-made malediction were large in
number. Movement within parts of the city, without risk to life,
became paralysed. The spectre of assassination and crime stalked the
streets. Goons of a particular political brood took over and the mafiosi
were at large and to our shock and shame, Bombay's shining streets
and slimy slums went through battle like episodes. The criminal
gangs and the communal cliques generally go into action in such a
situation of total breakdown of law and order. The police must be at
their best and the government must govern most, in such critical
moments when the common people are helpless and communal
frenzy consumes collective sanity. However, in Bombay, at the
relevant time the governing rule appeared to be quite the contrary.
That police is best which polices the least, is a dangerous doctrine of
abdication of constitutional power, but this was unfortunately what
happened when Bombay was set on fire.
There were however, people who had a
deep sense of brotherhood and amity,
courage to venture out and save sisters,
whatever their community, enter the theatre
of action and restore calm where passion
would otherwise have prevailed. The soul
of this super-city has not been stifled.
Slowly, Bombay is coming back to life and
it is our fundamental duty to heal the wounds and hasten the
rehabilitation process.

> That police is
best which polices the
least, is a dangerous

The first task is to do justice which is the foremost human right.
However, the legal process lost its locomotion and objective
investigation of the crimes, looked like having fallen casualty to
political acrimony. At a certain stage, belatedly, the Maharashtra
Government announced a Judicial Inquiry by a sitting judge, into
events which led to the riots and other relevant matters. The precise
terms of reference are not before me, but Shri Justice Srikrishna was
appointed as a Commission to inquire and report about the macabre
happenings. The Indian People's Human Rights Commission and
Tribunal found the overall inaction on the part of the administration
too insouciant and unconscionable and so persuaded two
distinguished, retired Judges of the Bombay High Court, Shri Justice
S.M.Daud and Shri Justice Suresh, to undertake a quick and
comprehensive inquiry into the tragic events that bled Bombay, spread
destruction and incinerated structures. The two learned Judges did not
confine themselves to fixed places to hold court with formalities,
legalities and inhibitions of rules and procedures. They visited places
where injustice had been inflicted, met broken men, sobbing women
and wailing children, gathered their tales of woe and did a patriotic job
of compassionately collecting from the aggrieved people, all available
materials. Public notice was given to all, co-operation was sought
from all and an open mind was kept throughout. All documents and
affidavits as could be gathered or were offered, were received and the
government and officials were contacted for co-operation and
information. Natural justice was fully complied with, within the limits
of time, conditions and resources the Judges could afford.

> The right to
know is a citizen's
right. The freedom of

rights.

The right to know is a citizen's right. The freedom of
information is fundamental to all fundamental rights. A People's
Tribunal gathering information, collecting relevant materials on an
event of public importance, sorting them out judicially, marshalling the
evidence and conveying the whole
testimony so gathered, in the shape of a
report, is the discharge of public duty of the
highest order. No one can, under the laws
of India, stop the right to give or receive
information, except where it is
mischievously intended to interfere with or
skew the course of judicial justice. Here
the two Judges, at great personal sacrifice
and without remuneration whatsoever except the gratitude of the
public, did discharge a noble responsibility and produced an impartial,
painstaking report. I was the Chairman of the Indian People's Human
Rights Tribunal (a voluntary body doing gratuitous service when
nationally important events call for an inquiry from the people's angle).
I persuaded the two Judges to make the inquiry and produce a report.
The sole and whole purpose was to inform the people of the facts; all
the facts that could be readily garnered and presented to the public.
The goal was to give the people the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, of course, subject to the serious limitations of an informal
inquiry without powers except that of persuasion, without resources,
except the good offices of well-meaning volunteers. "Know ye the
truth and the truth shall make you free". That is the foundation of our
freedom.

The inquiry has been completed, the Report is being
communicated to the nation. Personally, I am profoundly grateful to
Justices Daud and Suresh, who have taken great pains, undergone
infinite inconvenience, and received not a rupee by way of reward, nor
a facility in return. Words cannot adequately express my profound
gratitude to them. The perennial goodwill of the common people is all
they seek and that feeling will surely flow towards them in abundance.
I release the Report to the Indian people. Bombay belongs to India
and the people of India have a right to know what did take place in
those distressing days of December 1992 and January 1993.

I cannot stop with offering the Report to my countrymen. I
must emphasise the great importance and the grave implications of the
pregnant observations as well as the short term and long term
recommendations made by the People's Bench, as it were. There has
been some measure of dereliction. inaction and occasional
collaboration on the sly by the police, as is seen from the report. A
government where the police is dubious or devious cannot last. The
top echelons might have tirelessly striven to do their duty. The
limitations they laboured under may be
many. The inner reserves and moral fibre
of the forces might have been under stress
and further polluted by politickers. The
untold story may be the iceberg hidden
from view. But no alibi avails when justice
fails and relief is remote. The people lose
confidence in the security they expect, if
the administration does not police the
police. The significance of the people's participation, even in the
maintenance of peace and tranquillity, must be taken serious note of.
Democracy wins only where the people's faith is won. A wealth of
recommendations, which I need not repeat here, is really addressed to
the Governments(State and Central). These proposals are made, not in
the spirit of carping criticism, nor with a view to discredit any
department or authority or minister. The object is benign, and geared
to the good of the people. Police brutality is sometimes defended by
the Establishment as an inevitable evil. It begins as inevitable but ends
as evil. The State should never believe that excess is the easy way to
success. Nietzsche once said, "Whoever fights monsters should see
that in the process he does not become a monster. And when you
look long into an abyss, the abyss also looks long into you."

Communalism, with fascist facets and engineered by
criminalised and politicised groups will destroy our democracy and
overthrow our Republic. Therefore, every constructive suggestion
made, must be taken seriously by the State. The minority community,
which in an overall view, suffered terribly, deserves better protection.
That is the measure of our culture.

"To wipe every tear from every eye" is the tryst we made at the
birth of our nation as a sovereign Bharat. Irresistibly, there is a moral
and even legal obligation to make compensation and rehabilitation a
reality for the victims of the Bombay tragedies. Humanist
compensation must be liberal and must not wait for legal proceedings
and procedural formalities. The jurisprudence of mass casualties must
be evolved and put into action through the involvement of voluntary
social action groups or other popular methodologies.

Justice is what justice does. I hope the State of Maharashtra will
do justice to its people and not defeat it by official or judicial delays
and other blockages.
