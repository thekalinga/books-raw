# RELIEF AND REHABILITATION MEASURES

The enormity of the havoc wrought by the riots compelled a
callous administration to come out with proclamations of restitution to
the sufferers. These proclamations were given fairly late in the day. In
fact, as compensation was declared to be paid to the dependents
whose bread-winners were killed, police commissioner Bapat made a
comment that the announcement of compensation had inspired
Muslims to make false complaints of excesses against his disciplined
and innocent police force ! Rs. 1,00,000 was sanctioned as
compensation for the dependents of those killed; Rs. 30,000 was to
be paid instantly and the balance in bonds having a maturity period of
five years. By itself, the amount sounds quite impressive, but there
have been complaints of non-payment of compensation in several
cases as also foot - dragging in making such payments.

Quite a number of persons had just disappeared, there being no
trace of their corpses. In such cases, the
presumption under the prevailing
circumstances should be that they have
been killed and their corpses dumped
somewhere. That the police or the people
have not been able to find the dead bodies
is not areason for inferring that the missing
are still alive and absconding. There is no
proof of the police having searched every
nook and corner of Bombay for the missing persons. Quite a number
of unidentified bodies did turn up and it is quite possible that the
missing ones have got so decomposed as to be unidentifiable. One
more suspicion is that quite a number of persons have been killed
and their bodies spirited away by the killers, which does not
necessarily exclude the trigger-happy police.

As to the wounded persons, there have been complaints that the
compensation offered is a pittance and that it is far below the sums
required by some of the victims for their treatment. A large number of
wounded persons have not received any compensation as their
complaints had not been recorded by the police.

For houses burnt down a compensation of Rs. 5,000 has been
fixed. We must express our astonishment at the inadequacy of this
figure as a panacea forall those who had the misfortune of having their
homes targeted by the arsonists. The amount is wholly inadequate,
even with regard to a hutment which would cost more than Rs.5,000.
One does not understand what led to the choice of Rs. 5,000 to
compensate those whose residences have been reduced to ashes.
Inexplicably, no such amount has been awarded to those whose
houses have been destroyed. In this connection, many witnesses
have complained that the refusal by the police to record
panchnamas for the loss they had suffered, led to their not
receiving even this meagre amount.

The larger number of sufferers are those whose movables were
brought out of their homes and shops and made bonfires of. These
persons are, according to a recent announcement to receive
compensation of up to Rs.4,000.The rioters brought out movables
from Muslim shops and residences so as to avoid losses to the
possibly Hindu owners of these structures, or the danger to Hindu
structures in the vicinity. In some cases, after looting, the articles
have been sold for a song, as in the case of Dawood shoes. The
amount set as compensation will be nowhere near enough to make
good the losses that the victims have
suffered.

Instantaneous relief was granted to
help hospitalised victims at the rate of Rs.
250 per person and this amount would
not be enough for expenditure on first-aid.
A large number of witnesses stated that
for all the losses suffered by them, they
received only Rs. 250 and nothing else.
As compared to the apathy of the official agencies, in several
localities, people on their own or with the help of various
organisations, succeeded in staving off trouble, as well as
providing the victims with relief . In the very midst of the riots they
swung into action. Not only did they try to maintain peace and
restore it when it had been broken in various areas, but they went
further and did their utmost to bring relief to people in whatever
way they could. Food packets, conveyance, medical treatment,
milk, clothes, blankets, etc. were distributed by individuals and
groups spontaneously. People going out in cars loaded with food
and other material, stopping at clusters of refugees and distributing
the material to the victims were a common sight in those troubled
times. While official agencies haggled about their cuts and their
red tape requirements, the people of Bombay and many of the
NGOs gave freely and unhesitatingly.

>Official agencies
have been guilty of
creating obstacles in
the path of the NGOs
engaged in
rehabilitation.

Unfortunately, the government and the BMC, in cahoots with

the _Hindutva_ forces and corrupt municipal councillors, have not
hesitated to obstruct the NGOs engaged in rehabilitation work.
Therefore the official agencies have been guilty not only of
niggardliness but much worse of creating obstacles in the path of the
NGOs engaged in rehabilitation. It is also regrettable that the
government has not come out with any scheme for the rehabilitation of
a large number of persons who have lost everything - their houses,
their properties, their jobs and their means of livelihood.
