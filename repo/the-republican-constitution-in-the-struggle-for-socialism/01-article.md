# The Republican Constitution in the Struggle for Socialism

We are proud of our Republican Constitution. We consider its adoption
by the Constituent Assembly to be a memorable event in the
history of our country. That event put an end to the decades of
foreign domination as well as several centuries of caste-ridden, conservative,
socio-cultural set-up; it inscribed on our banner the
inspiring slogans of political liberty, parliamentary democracy, an
end to all forms of social inequality, and guarantee of all-round
progress.

It is therefore understandable that anybody who shows disrespect
to, or decries, our Constitution is not popular among our people.
Critics of the Constitution are told: if you see defects and inadequacies
in the Constitution, why can you not try to remove them
through the processes and methods laid down in the Constitution
itself? Why do you decry and show disrespect to that very Constitution
which has given you the right to criticize and try to change it?
Do you not see that, having adopted a Republican democratic Constitution,
our national leadership has gone forward to adopt the
programme of establishing a socialist society and to this end evolved
the system of planned development of our economy? Is it not therefore
the task of those who are interested in further carrying forward
the gains secured when the Republican Constitution was adopted by
using this very democratic Republican Constitution to make it an
instrument of building socialism?

These questions are particularly addressed to those of us who believe
in the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. We are supposed to be
people who have no faith in the democratic process. Loyalty to the
basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism is supposed to be inconsistent with
loyalty to the principles and processes of parliamentary democracy.
It is therefore with a sense of gratitude that I am taking this opportunity
to explain our attitude to the Republican Constitution of India ;
how we propose to work within its framework in order to bring
about those fundamental socio-economic changes that we are striving
to bring about.

Let me, at the very outset, make it clear that Marxism-Leninism
does not take a rigid or dogmatic stand on the particular mode of
bringing about social transformations. No method is excluded, nor
is any laid down as the one and only acceptable method. The only
criterion on which Marxism-Leninism bases itself when it selects a
particular method for bringing about social transformations is
whether it will serve the purpose. If there is more than one method
out of which a choice can be made, Marxism-Leninism would consider
which will yield results more quickly and less painfully. That
was why Marx and Engels, who were of the view that State power
will have to be seized through the use of force ("force is the midwife
of the new society"), nevertheless thought it's necessary to draw attention
to the possibility that England with its predominantly working-class
population, its growing organization of the working class and
with its system of parliamentary democracy might be able to pass over
from capitalism to socialism through peaceful means. Several years
after this, Lenin, their loyal disciple, who consistently applied their
theory of revolution pointed out that, while the possibility of peaceful
transformation in England did undoubtedly exist in the days of
Marx and Engels, it ceased to exist after the transformation of early
("free") capitalism into monopoly-capitalism. That was again why
the Marxists-Leninists of the world did envisage, in 1957 and 1960,
the possibility of relatively peaceful transformations in several
countries, since imperialism had got weakened on a world-scale and
since indigenous capitalism in individual countries was not so powerful
as before. These changes in approach to the possibility or otherwise
of peaceful transformations show that the so-called "rigidity"
of the Marxists on the question of State power is a figment of imagination
of some people. The fact of the matter is that, while Marxism-Leninism
will not have that pathetic faith in the efficacy of the
_bourgeois_ parliamentary democratic system which was characteristic
of social democracy, they are not allergic to the system of parliamentary
democracy, as their enemies accused them of.

Let me now come to the specific question of the Republican Constitution
of India. On a Marxist-Leninist analysis of the circumstances
in which that Constitution came to be adopted and the contents of
that Constitution, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) came
to the conclusion that its adoption does certainly indicate an advance
for our people. Our programme says: "Universal adult franchise and
Parliament and State Legislatures can serve as instruments of the
people in their struggle for democracy, for defence of their interests.
Although a form of class rule of the _bourgeoisie_, India's parliamentary
system also embodies an advance for the people. It affords certain
opportunities to them to defend their interests, intervene in the
affairs of the State to a certain extent and mobilise them to carry
forward the struggle for peace, democracy and social progress".
(Para. 71)

Our Party is of the view that, so long as this system continues, it
is in the interest of the working class and the working people to so
utilize the institutions built up on the basis of this Constitution as
to further consolidate and strengthen the struggles of the working
people for basic social transformations. That is why the very Seventh
Congress of the Party which adopted the fundamental programme
of the Party, also adopted a resolution on the (then ensuing) 1965
mid-term election in Kerala, which called for such a United Front
of the Communists, Socialists and other progressive democratic
parties, groups and individuals as "will give the State a stable
Government which pursues popular democratic policies". That was
again why on the eve of the Fourth General Elections, the Central
Committee of the Party in its election manifesto, gave the slogans
of "removing the Congress monopoly of power in as many States as
possible, improving and increasing the strength of the democratic
opposition and above all of the C.P.I. (Marxist) in all the States
and at the Centre".

While thus considering the adoption of the Republican Constitution
as an advance and utilizing its provisions for the further
strengthening of the working class and democratic movements in
the country, the Party has no illusion that the working class and
democratic movements will be permitted to use the parliamentary
democratic institutions to such an extent, and for such a length of
time, that fundamental social transformations can be carried out
through the much-talked-of "Parliamentary path". The experience
of all countries which have so far adopted the system of _bourgeois_
parliamentary democracy (including the experience of the working
of our own Republican Constitution) makes it clear that the ruling
classes allow the luxury of parliamentary democracy only so long as
their own class interests are not threatened. A study of what
happened in European countries after the First World War, and
what our own Central Congress Government did in those cases where
the General Election led to the replacing of Congress by another
party or coalition of parties, enabling them to form non-Congress
Governments in this or that State, exposes the hollowness of the
democratic pretensions of the ruling classes. That is why our Party
declared in its Programme:

>The threat to the Parliamentary system and to democracy
comes not from the working people and the parties which represent
their interests. The threat comes from the exploiting classes. It is
they who undermine the parliamentary system both from within
and without by making it an instrument to advance their narrow
interests and repress the toiling masses. When the people begin
to use parliamentary institutions for advancing their cause, and
they fall away from the influence of the reactionary _bourgeoisie_
and landlords, these classes do not hesitate to trample underfoot
parliamentary democracy as was done in Kerala in 1959. When
their interests demand they do not hesitate to replace parliamentary
democracy by military dictatorship. It will be a serious error
and a dangerous illusion to imagine that our country is free from
all such threats. It is of utmost importance that parliamentary and
democratic institutions are defended in the interest of the people
against such threats, and that such institutions are skilfully
utilised in combination with extra-parliamentary activities.

Let us analyse the structure of power built up as per the provisions
of the Constitution. We find that the repository of executive
power is the President of India who not only exercises power "either
directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with
this Constitution" (_Art. 53(1)_); "The supreme command of the
Defence Forces of the Union shall (also) be vested with the President"
(_Art. 53(2)_). The executive power to be exercised by him has,
of course, been technically restricted to the field of the 'Union'; the
corresponding power in the States is vested in the Governors (_Art.
154_). In reality, however, the Governor is a nominee of the President
and holds office during the pleasure of the President (_Art. 155 and
156 (1)_). The President is also the authority who appoints the Judges
of the High Court of every State (_Art. 217_). Another important
instrument of administrative power (the Public Service Commission
of the State which makes appointments for all the top and middle
posts of State Services) is also appointed by the Governor (_Art.
316_). Such highly-centralized power vested in the President of the
Union and his creatures in the States can very well be so used as to
subvert parliamentary democracy behind a facade of "Constitutionalism".
This, as is well known, was what happened in several
neighbouring countries. That it has not happened in India does not
mean that it will not happen here. It only means that the political
system in our country has not reached the stage of crisis reached
elsewhere.

It is, of course, true that the executive power is to be exercised by
the President of the Union and by the Governors of States only in
their capacities as Constitutional heads of States. The President of
the Union shall exercise his functions only with the aid and advice
of the Council of Ministers (_Art. 74 (1)_); the Governors of States
also likewise exercise their functions with the aid and advice of his
Council of Ministers (_Art. 163_). The Union and State Councils
of Ministers in their turn do under the established convention
of parliamentary democracy, hold office only so long as they
have the confidence of the Parliament and the State Legislatures
respectively. The Constitution, however, provides that they hold
office during the "pleasure of the President and Governor respectively
(Articles 75 (2) and 164(1))." Neither the President nor the
Governor is, under normal circumstances, expected to have his "pleasure"
in a way different from the fact of the Council of Ministers
having the confidence of the Parliament and State Legislature respectively.
But in abnormal times, when the political system has
reached a stage of crisis, there can very well be a conflict between
the "pleasure" of the Constitutional head and the confidence of the
Parliament or the State Legislature respectively.

Although vested with extensive despotic powers, it may be said,
the President is elected, the electoral college consisting of elected
members of both Houses of Parliament and the elected members of
the Legislative Assemblies of the State (_Art. 51_). He is also liable
under certain conditions to be impeached for violation of the Constitution
by either of the Houses of Parliament (_Art. 61_). This right
of the Parliament to punish the President, however, can be negated
because, unlike in several other countries having the parliamentary
democratic system, our members of parliament have no immunity
from arrest and detention. Whenever there is a political crisis --- and it
is only in times when there are crises that the Constitution breaks
down --- sufficient number of members of Parliament can be put behind
the bars. That this is not a figment of the imagination but can
very well become a reality can be seen from two facts. Firstly,
several members of Parliament were detained without trial under
the _Defence of India Rules_ in 1962--63 and 1964--65. Secondly, 29
members of the State Legislature elected in Kerala in the 1965 midterm
election, belonging to the Party that came out as the biggest
single party, were detained and this fact was used by the Governor
of that State to report to the President that no party is in a position
to form a Government; this led to the dissolution of the Legislature
even before the elected members took their oath of office. If this
could be done to a sufficient number of members of a State Legislature
in a time of crisis for this particular State, how can it be assumed
that it will not happen at the Centre when the Centre itself is
faced with a similar crisis ?

Crucial to the discussion of the democratic character of the Republican
Constitution, the guarantees that it provides for the peaceful
transition from a socio-economic system based on landlord-capitalistic
exploitation to a socialist system, is the way in which our political
system is enveloped by a growing crisis. That such a crisis is, in
fact, developing will not be denied by anyone at least after the
Fourth General Elections. The crisis had, in reality, started developing
as early as in 1952. In three States, the Congress was reduced
to a minority in the respective State Legislatures in 1952. The
Central Government and the Party that led it, however, used the
institutions of the Rajpramukh and the Governor in those States to
prevent the formation of non-Congress Governments. That situation
was changed slightly in favour of the Congress in subsequent years.
But still the Congress could not prevent the formation of a nonCongress
Government in Kerala in 1957. Here again, the executive
power vested in the President was used in order to dismiss that nonCongress
Government. It was only after the third General Elections
that the Congress could form its own Government not only at the
Centre but in all the States. This, however, was followed by the
Fourth General Elections, when there was a veritable landslide
against the Congress. Once again, therefore, the party in power at
the Centre used its authority to get as many non-Congress Governments
dismissed as possible. The method adopted for this in West
Bengal was denounced by such an august body as the All-India
Speakers' conference, presided over by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.

Seen against this background, the growing crisis of confidence in
the leadership of the Central Government, the unconcealed intrigues
resorted to by various groups within the ruling party, raise the ominous
question: what will happen to the Centre if and when a group of
Congress MPs defects to the Opposition as happened in Haryana,
Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in March and April 1967? Again,
supposing that in the 5th General Elections the Congress is reduced
to a minority in Parliament, is it unimaginable that what was
done in 1952, in 1957--59 and 1967--68 in those States where the Congress
was reduced to a minority in the Legislature will not be done
at the Centre? If that happens to the Centre, will that be very far
from a full-fledged military dictatorship?

If we are to have a proper understanding of the essence of the
crisis, the political aspects of which were briefly outlined above, we
should go a little deeper into the socio-economic factors leading to
this crisis. For, only a superficial observer of the political scene in
our country can look upon these manifestations of the political crisis
as passing phenomena. Any objective, truthful study of the situation
will reveal that the political crisis is a manifestation of the deep
gulf that separates the expectations of the people when the country
attained Independence and their experience of what actually happened
in the post-independent years. The Preamble to the Constitution
which gave expression to the solemn resolve of the Constitution-framers
to secure to all Indian citizens "(a) justice --- social, economic
and political; (b) liberty of thought --- expression, belief, faith
and worship; (c) equality of status and opportunity" is an expression
of the expectations with which the people welcomed the
Republican Constitution of India. The Fundamental Rights embodied
in Part III and the Directive Principles of State Policy laid down in
Part IV of the Constitution also give expression to these expectations
of the people. These are undoubtedly noble declarations. They inspire
every Indian citizen with the idea that he or she belongs to a country
which is determined to take its place among the most advanced,
freedom-loving and democratic countries in the world.

As opposed to this, however, is the living experience of the people.
Every one of the fundamental rights inscribed on the banner of the
Republic is violated --- except of course the _right to property_. Not
the property of the small and medium-size cultivator or artisan who
is steadily being pauperised, and thrown into the ranks of the unemployed
and employment-seeking millions. It is the _right to property_
of the big land-lords and of the growing sections of monopoly
capitalists that is protected and in protecting which the Government
attacks the mass of the working people. The result is that the people
are getting rapidly disillusioned and are therefore losing faith in
the Congress and its declaration of building a new India on the
foundations of democratic socialism. It is this loss of faith in the
Congress that is reflected in the waning prestige and power of the
Congress --- a process which cannot be reversed, but will, on the other
hand, grow from year to year unless the basic policies are changed.

Nobody disputes the wide gulf between the expectations with
which the people greeted the attainment of Independence in 1947 and
their subsequent experience. It is recognized even by the leaders of
the ruling Party who blame it on the fact that the correct policies
laid down by them have not been properly implemented. Opposition
parties, on the other hand, point out that the policies themselves are
wrong. Among the Opposition parties themselves, there are two
schools of thought; one, which may be called Left Opposition, is of
opinion that the policies are calculated to serve the interests of landlords
and capitalists and opposed to the interests of the working
people, and the other, which may be called the Right Opposition,
thinks that the ruling Party is adopting policies which are too radical,
too socialistic and doctrinaire. Both sections of the Opposition,
however, plead for a radical change of policies. According to them,
change of policies is the only way in which the growing discontent
of the people can be removed and the country march along the path
of progress.

There are, at the same time, some --- our Party is one of them
--- who hold the view that neither the inadequate implementation of
accepted policies (conceded by the ruling Party), nor the incorrect
policies (pointed out by the Opposition) fully explain the divergence
between the people's early expectations and their subsequent experience.
According to us, this is inherent in the very State structure
built up under the Constitution. Even the most radical reversal
of the policies --- the adoption of the most progressive, anti-imperialist,
anti-feudal and anti-monopoly policies --- would not help the solution
of the problem unless it is accompanied by a fundamental recasting
of the State structure built under the Constitution. As a matter of
fact, the very process of laying down and implementing radical progressive
policies would be thwarted by the various checks built into
the framework of the Constitution. Recall the fate of the various
land reform measures which the Congress Governments laid to push
through the various Legislatures. These are not radical, not to speak
of revolutionary, measures. They fall far short of even the measures
introduced by the American Occupation Regime in Japan. Yet, within
a year of the coming into force of our Constitution, Parliament
had to amend a section of _Article 31_ in order to give protection to
certain land reform legislations (_Art. 31A_). This amendment had
to be followed by other amendments to the Constitution, all of which
were calculated to facilitate the implementation of various agrarian
reform legislations. This process has at last reached a stage when
the legality and constitutionality of this process of amending Part
III of the Constitution in order to facilitate progressive legislation
has been questioned; the well-known majority judgement of the
Supreme Court, headed by former Chief Justice Subha Rao, rejects
the right of Parliament to get such amending legislations pushed
through. If this is the fate of legislative measures which can in no
way be considered radical or revolutionary, it is obvious that the
radical policies advocated by the Parties of the Left Opposition would
meet with still more serious obstacles built into the Constitution.

Compare, for instance, Part III and Part IV of the Constitution :
The former deals with Fundamental Rights while the latter relates
to what are called Directive Principles of State policy. It is in the
latter that the essentials of what is known as the concept of Welfare
State are spelt out. One article included in that Part commits the
State to "strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing
and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice
--- social, economic and political, shall inform all the institutions of the
national life" (_Art. 38_). Still another Article directs the State to
see that "the ownership and control of the material resources of the
community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good"
(_Art. 39(b)_); that "the operation of the economic system does not
result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to
the common detriment" (_Art. 39 (c)_); there is equal pay for equal
work for both men and women" (_Art. 39(d)_); and so on. Among the
other rights of the people, the State has been directed to "make effective
provision" for "securing the right to work, to education and
to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and
disablement" (_Art. 41_); "just and humane conditions of work and
for maternity relief" (_Art. 42_); "a living wage, conditions of work
ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment and leisure
and social and cultural opportunities" (_Art. 43_) and so on. These
undoubtedly express the hopes and expectations with which our
people greeted the new Independent India. Before laying down these
Directive Principles of State policy, however, the Constitution-makers
make it clear that "the provisions contained in this Part
shall not be enforceable by any court" (_Art. 37_). They have thus
been reduced to noble declarations, with no sanction behind them.

As opposed to this is Part III on Fundamental Rights which are
enforceable by the Judiciary. _Art. 32_ lays down the procedure for
moving the Supreme Court and the court examining the cases of
violation of fundamental rights. It is very significant that the most
crucial right embodied in this part of the Constitution is the _Right
to Property_. It was in relation to this that several cases came before
the Supreme Court which gave its judgment against the very moderate
social reform measures introduced by the Congress Government.
It is again in relation to this that the well-known Subba Rao judgment
came to the conclusion that even Parliament has no right to
so alter the Fundamental Rights provisions in the Constitution as
to take away the _Right to Property_. It is obvious that, so long as this
provision continues to remain in the Constitution, the court will
strike down each and every radical legislation. It is also obvious
that, so long as the Subba Rao judgment is in force, Parliament will
be powerless to make amendments to the Constitution in order to
meet this difficult situation.

_Right to property_, of course, is not the only provision contained
in Part III of the Constitution. There are other rights like the right
to equality before law, right against discrimination on grounds of
religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth; right to equality of
opportunity in matters of public employment and so on. They are
supposed to be enforceable by courts of law. But we know very well
that, while the Constitution solemnly declares that every citizen of
India is equal before another citizen, inequality between the rich
and the poor is steadily increasing. This growing inequality cannot
be prevented even by the Supreme Court, though this right is (on
paper) enforceable by courts of law. As for the right against discrimination
on grounds of religion, it is enough to point out how
the militant organizations preaching hatred for non-Hindu religious
communities, particularly the Muslims, have become a serious threat.
Although the seriousness of this threat is recognized even by the
Home Minister of the Union Government, he seems to be powerless
to stop the growing attacks on the religious minorities. Here
again, minorities who are victims of militant communal organizations
of the majority community are helpless; the courts which are
supposed to enforce this right are also powerless. Without making
a more detailed analysis of all other Fundamental Rights, which are
sacred and rather important for the common people, it may be pointed
out that the most fundamental of the Fundamental Rights --- the
right to _personal freedom_ --- has been subjected to the most serious
and shameless violations. The operation of the _Defence of India
Rules (D.I.R)_ framed in the wake of the border conflict with China has become
the subject matter of serious criticism by all sections of the
democratic public opinion in the country. The Supreme Court itself,
in one of its judgments, cast doubts on the legality and constitutionality
of certain provisions of the _D.I.R._ and held back its judgment
only on the ground that the very Emergency-declaration made
by the President took such measures away from the purview of the
Court. In other words, the very Supreme Court which through a
majority judgment banned Parliament from legislating against the
_Right to Property_ seemed powerless against the Government's attack
on the fundamental right of _personal liberty_. Would it be unpatriotic
on our part under these circumstances to conclude that the net result
of the provisions in Part III and Part IV, and the way in which
they are interpreted by the Courts and enforced by the executive,
make it clear that every other Fundamental Right is to be subordinated
to the _Right to Property_, while the essentials of a Welfare
State are reduced to mere declarations of pious intentions.

Those who want to bring about radical socio-economic transformations
through the "constitutional path" are thus faced with two
difficulties. Firstly, if they happen to win a majority in the State
Legislature (as has happened in a few cases). the power of the
Centre is used against them. The use of this power may go to the
extent of dismissal of the elected Ministry (as happened in Kerala
in 1959 or in West Bengal in 1967). It may also happen that, if the
elected Ministry is not so crudely dismissed, the radical measures it
seeks to pilot through the Legislature are blocked (as happened in
Kerala for the agrarian reform and educational bills in 1958--59).
Or, it may also take the form of rejecting the legitimate demands
of the State Government for food, financial assistance, an adequate
share of industrial and other developments, etc. Secondly, if the
forces standing for radical socio-economic transformations are able
to win a majority in Parliament and to form a radical Government
at the Centre, they cannot carry out their programmes of radical
changes in property relations unless and until the Constitution itself
is amended in important directions. This will not be easy, but will
be a protracted and difficult process. Technically it is difficult since
an amendment to the Constitution requires that it is "passed in each
House of Parliament by a majority of the total membership of that
House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of members of
that House present and voting" (_Art. 368_). Politically too, it involves
a serious conflict between the champions of those social transformations
and their opponents. The latter, as is well known, are
extremely powerful and have under their control all the media of
publicity and propaganda through which they can confuse the people.
They are also masters of the money purse which they can extensively
utilize in order to mobilize considerable sections of the population
against the attempted social transformations. It is therefore inevitable
that clashes and conflicts take place among the people who are
rallied behind the two camps --- the champions and opponents of these
social transformations. It is unrealistic to think that, in such a situation
of growing conflict between the two camps of the people, the
Parliamentary democratic system will be preserved intact and not be
subverted, as has happened in several other countries.

This, however, is not the only way in which the Constitution may
break down. An equally serious threat to the smooth working of the
Constitution emanates from the steadily deteriorating relation between
the Centre and the States. It is just enough to mention the
names of Kashmir, Nagaland, Mizoland, the Hill peoples of Assam,
the Hindi and non-Hindi conflict and the insistent demand of all the
States (including Congress-governed States) for greater power and
greater share of the economic development of the country. Every one
of them is an explosive issue, some of which have, in fact, already
reached the stage of veritable explosion. The longer the time taken
to find a solution for any of these problems, the more complicated it
becomes. On the other hand, every solution that is offered adds a new
complexity to the problem which it did not have so far. Those who
are trying to find solutions therefore have reached a veritable dead
end.

The reason for this, according to our Party, is the totally unrealistic
premise on which the Federal State structure has been built into
the Constitution --- the premise that a "strong and powerful Centre"
is necessary for the preservation of the unity of the country. The
division of functions between the Federal Centre and the federating
units has been so arranged that the essence of State power rests
with the Centre, the States being vested with only outside manifestations
of power. The entire field of economic development and
planning; control over currency, finance, prices and so on; the most
elastic and expanding sources of revenue --- all these are left to the
Centre. This arms the Centre with adequate power to lay down the
economic and financial law for the States. Even in the management
of those subjects which have been formally allocated to the States,
the Centre is in a position to make the States sub-serve its dictates
in the name of all-India "co-ordination", using for the purpose the
absolute financial dependence of the States on the Centre. The Civil
Services of the States --- the agency through which the State Governments
have to carry on the administration --- are also controlled by
the Centre which has built up a new edition of the old "steel frame"
of the British rulers. While the Constitution itself had rested the
Federal Centre with extensive powers, the eighteen years of its
working has made further inroads into the powers of the States.
In the face of this ever-expanding power of the Centre, the States
have been put to the necessity of fighting for greater powers. This
conflict between the aspirations of the States and the reality of the
central power is leading to as big a conflict as the social conflicts
between the rich and poor, referred to above.

In order to have a proper understanding of this phenomenon, it is
necessary to go into the history of how the federal idea got gradually
evolved. The birth of the federal idea should be seen against the
background of the movement for the formation of linguistic States
which had almost half a century of history before the Constituent
Assembly started its work of framing the Constitution. As soon as
the anti-imperialist freedom movement came under Mahatma
Gandhi's leadership and penetrated into the rural masses, formation
of linguistic States became one of the key slogans of freedom fighters.
This was a clear indication of the fact that the "unity of India" for
which the freedom movement was fighting cannot be divorced from
the "diversity of the various linguistic cultural groups" that inhabit
the country. Neither the military power wielded by the Emperors
of Ancient India nor the colonial engine of oppression perfected
by the British, which are supposed to have "united" India,
can be used in a "free and democratic" India. Indian unity today can
be maintained only if the leaders of the united India allow full freedom
of development to every linguistic-cultural group, reserving for
themselves only such minimum powers as are absolutely necessary
in the common interest of the entire people. This is the essence of
the federal idea.

However, discussion on this question in pre-Independence years
assumed a distorted form, since it was mixed up with the problem
of Hindu-Muslim relations. The spokesmen of the two major religious
communities became the champions of the unitary and federal
structures. It was in the course of an attempted agreement between
the two communities (the _Lucknow Pact of 1916_, the _All-Party Conference_
in the years preceding the 1935 Constitution and in the discussions
before the 1947 Transfer of Power) that the leaders of
National Congress accepted the federal idea. They therefore had
serious reservations on it, considering their acceptance of the Federal
idea as nothing more than a compromise. They therefore took advantage
of the first available opportunity --- the partition of India
which removed the Muslim League from the scene --- to bring back
as big a part of the unitary concept as they could. This was how, in
framing the Constitution, they subscribed to the federal principle in
words, but made the federal Centre so powerful that the State structure
as a whole is hardly distinguishable from a unitary one.

Light on this is thrown by the manner in which the problem of
Kashmir has been dealt with by the Central leaders. In the days of
the most acute conflict on the Kashmir issue --- in the immediate postIndependence
years --- it was agreed that Kashmir would accede to
the Indian Union only in relation to Defence, Foreign Affairs and
Communications. In relation to every other subject, the State of
Jammu and Kashmir was recognized as fully sovereign. Gradually,
however, the autonomy of the State was subjected to increasing encroachments
leading ultimately to the present situation where the
State is almost as much part of India as any other State. This, however,
has resulted in the most acute and continuing conflict between
the Centre and the State. The series of arrests and releases to which
the former Prime Minister of the State --- Sheikh Abdulla --- has been
subjected and the deadlock that has now been reached after his latest
release from prison, indicate the depth and seriousness of the crisis
of Centre-State relations in so far as it affects this State.

This one example, together with the developing situation in Nagaland,
Mizoland and the Assam Hills shows that the unity of India
including these areas cannot be preserved except on the basis of the
voluntary consent of the people concerned. The use of the over-riding
powers vested in the Centre will further antagonize the people of
these areas. If this continues for some time, it will be impossible to
resist their demand for a complete separation from India.

Hindi--non-Hindi controversy and the general demand of all the
States for greater powers and greater financial resources hare, of
course, not reached such an advanced stage of political crisis. There
are, however, sufficient indications to show that they too will develop
along these lines if they are not dealt with in a statesmanlike manner
and with vision. The essential prerequisite for such a statesman-like
approach is the recognition that India is a country inhabited
by peoples with different linguistic-cultural affinities. Any effort at
forging the unity of the country without taking account of the
"diversity" of its peoples will lead to disintegration and chaos. It is
this fact that is underlined by the anti-Hindi explosion of 1965
--- an explosion which virtually nullified _Art. 340_ of the Constitution
on the _Official Language_. Even after 15 years, (the period laid down
under _Sec. 2_ of that Article), English continues to be used for all
the official purposes of the Union and it may continue indefinitely.
Centre-State conflicts on economic and financial issues too have led
to agitations and movements drawing hundreds of thousands of
people, sometimes rallying the people of one State against that of
another, and sometimes rallying them against the Centre. It is a
question of time for all these problems to come up in as acute a form
as that of Kashmir, Nagaland, etc., unless, of course, the problem is
tackled with sufficient forethought and insight into the real forces
working behind these movements.

From this angle too, it is clear, the State structure built as per the
provisions of the Constitution requires thorough overhauling. It is
not proposed here to spell out in detail how this overhauling is to be
done. What is possible and necessary is only to emphasize that the
concept of a Federal State with "a strong Centre" having over-riding
powers on the autonomy of the States has been tried and found wanting.
Continuance of such a structure is bound to break the Constitution
under the heavy load of tensions which it has heaped on it.

This discussion may now be summed up by restating the attitude
of our Party to the Republican Constitution of India.

(a) We look upon the framing of the Constitution as a historical
landmark in the sense that it has given the working people and their
political representatives new opportunities for organizing themselves
and perfecting their weapons of struggle for a new socialist system.
The victories gained by them by way of not only reducing the Congress
strength in the country as a whole, but also forming nonCongress
Governments on occasions in a few States, are a guarantee
that the defence of the Parliamentary system is in the interests of
the working people.
(b) It would, however, be a dangerous illusion to think that this
system is so perfect that it can be used in order to transform the
present socio-economic system of exploitation into a socialistic system
through the mere use of constitutional means. The danger of
this system being subverted by the vested interests is very real.
Even if that danger is averted and the political representatives of
the working people do get a majority in the Central Parliament the
Constitution as has been framed and is being worked now should be
thoroughly overhauled if it is to be used for bringing about social
transformations.
(c) An equally or more serious danger to the system emanates
from the totally incorrect handling of the problems of Centre-State
relations which have already led to serious crises in some parts of
the country and which may well expand themselves into other parts.
The struggle against these incorrect policies of the ruling Party,
and for national integration on the basis of the well-known slogan
"unity in diversity", is therefore an inseparable part of the struggle
for the preservation of the Parliamentary democratic system.
(d) The threat to the Parliamentary system emanating from
the reactionaries can be fought back if and so long as the system
continues and the political representatives of the working people
use it skilfully. Adult suffrage, declaration of Fundamental Rights
and Directive Principles of State policy; legislative forums and the
Judiciary --- all these can, to a limited extent be used in order to
mobilize increasing sections of the people, against the reactionary
attempts at the subversion of the Parliamentary system.

It is on the basis of such an approach to the Constitution that our
Party has placed before the people a programme of overhauling the
State structure from top to bottom. That programme is as follows:

(1) _The sovereignty of the people_. The supreme power in the
State must be vested entirely in the people's representatives who will
be selected by the people on the basis of proportional representation
and be subject to recall at any time upon a demand by the majority
of the electorate.
(2) Universal, equal and direct suffrage for all male and female
citizens of India who have attained the age of 18 years, in all elections
to Parliament, State legislatures and to local Government bodies.
Secret ballot, the right of any voter to be elected to any representative
institution.
(3) Widest autonomy for the various States comprising the
Indian Federation.
(4) Completion of the process of reorganization of States on
linguistic basis. All States shall have equal powers.
(5) There shall be no Governors for the States appointed from
above. Nor shall there be the so-called Upper Houses. At the Centre
there shall be two Houses, the House of People and the House of
States. Both shall have equal powers and equal number of members.
The House of States shall have also equal representation from all
the States in the Indian Union. The President shall act in accordance
with decisions of both the Houses and shall have no other powers.
(6) The tribal areas or the areas where population is specific in
composition and is distinguished by specific social and cultural conditions
will have regional autonomy with regional Government within
the State concerned and shall receive full assistance for their development,
or have full autonomy.
(7) In the field of local administration, a wide network of local
bodies from the village upward, directly elected by the people, and
invested with real powers and responsibility. Adequate finances shall
be ensured to the local bodies.
(8) All administrative services shall be under the direct control
of the respective States or local authorities.
(9) Introduction of democratic changes in the administration
of justice. The judiciary will be completely independent of the executive.
The appointment of judges will be subject to approval by Parliament,
legislatures or appropriate people's organs at different levels;

* Right of all persons to sue any official in a court of law ;

* Free legal aid and advice will be provided for the needy in
  order to make legal redress easily available for all.

(10) The people's democratic Government will infuse the members
of the armed forces with the spirit of patriotism and democracy.
It will ensure them good living-standards and conditions of service,
maximum possible opportunities for cultural life, as well as the education
and well-being of their children.
(11) The introduction of graded tax in industry, agriculture and
trade; and maximum relief in taxation for workers, peasants and
artisans. Profits shall be controlled.
(12) All our institutions must be infused with the spirit of
democracy, of respect for and reliance on the people as well as confidence
in their determination to build a democratic society free
from bureaucracy and injustice.

The people's democratic Government will, therefore, extend
democratic forms of initiative and control over every aspect of
national life. A key role in this will be played by the trade unions,
peasant and agricultural labour associations and other organizations
of the working people. The Government will take steps to make the
legislative and executive machinery of the country continuously responsive
to the democratic wishes of the people and will ensure that
masses and their organizations are drawn into active participation
in the administration and work of the State. Bureaucratization shall
be eliminated. Wide disparities in salaries and incomes are to be
abolished.

(13) Inviolability of person and domicile; no detention without
trial, unhampered freedom of conscience, religious belief and worship,
speech, press, assembly, strike and combination, freedom of
movement and occupation.
(14) Equal rights for all citizens irrespective of religion, caste,
sex, race or nationality, equal pay for equal work irrespective of sex.
(15) Removal of social disabilities from which women suffer,
equal rights with men in such matters as inheritance of property,
enforcement of marriage and divorce laws, admission to professions
and services.
(16) Abolition of social oppression of one caste by another,
untouchability to be punished by law. Special facilities for the scheduled
castes, tribes and other backward communities shall be provided
in the matter of services and other social and educational
amenities.
(17) Separation of the State from all religious institutions ; the
secular character of the State will be guaranteed. Interference by
religious institutions in the affairs of the State and the political life
of the country shall be prohibited;
Religious minorities shall be given protection against discrimination.

(18) Right of people to receive instruction in their mother-tongue
in educational institutions; the use of the national language
of the particular State as the language of administration in all its
public and State institutions, as well as its use as the medium of
education in the State up to the highest standard; provision for the
use of the language of a minority or region where necessary, in addition
to the language of the State. Use of Hindi as an all-India language
will not be obligatory, but will be encouraged as a means of
intercourse between the people of different States. Adherence to the
principle of replacing English by the regional languages at the
State level and Hindi at the Centre as administrative language.
Transition from English to Hindi at the Centre should be simultaneous
with that from English to the regional languages in the State;
the preparation for this transition, which is being made by the Centre
with regard to Hindi, should also be made with all necessary Central
assistance in States in regard to regional languages. At the same
time, for the transition period, the duration of which should be decided
with the consent of the non-Hindi-speaking regions, English
should be given the status of an associate administrative language.
Equality of all national languages in Parliament and Central administration
will be recognized. Members of Parliament will have
the right to speak in any national language and simultaneous translation
will be provided in all national languages. All acts, Government
orders and resolutions will be made available in all national
languages. Urdu language and its script will be protected.

Free and compulsory education up to the secondary stage.

(19) Establishment of a wide network of health, medical and
maternity services, free of cost, as well as rest homes and recreation
centres for the people.
(20) The people's democratic State and Government will undertake
the important task of unleashing the creative talents of the
people for creating and extending the new progressive people's culture
which is anti-imperialist, anti-feudal and democratic in character.
Necessary measures to foster, encourage and develop such literature,
art and culture as will :

* help each nationality, including the tribal people, to develop
  their own distinctive way and in unison with the common aspirations
  of the democratic masses of the country as a whole;

* help the democratic masses in their struggle to improve their
  living conditions and enrich their life;

* help the people to get rid of caste and communal hatred and
  prejudices and ideas of subservience or superstitions ;

* help all people to develop feelings of brotherhood with the
  peace-loving peoples of all countries and discourage ideas of racial
  and national hatred.

(21) The people's democratic Government will take measures to
consolidate the unity of India by fostering and promoting mutual cooperation
between the constituent States and between the peoples of
different States in the economic, political and cultural spheres. It
will pay special attention and financial and other assistance to economically
backward and weaker States, regions and areas with a view
to helping them rapidly overcome their backwardness.
