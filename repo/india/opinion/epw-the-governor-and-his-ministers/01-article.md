_This examination of the position of the Governor in relation to the Council of Ministers leads
to the conclusion that the constitutional position in regard to the situation in West Bengal is as
follows:_

_The Governor's power to prorogue or convene a session of the Legislature can be exercised
only on the advice of the Council of Ministers._

_The only constitutional limitation regarding convening of a State Legislature is that six months
shall not intervene between the last sitting in one session and the first sitting in the next. In West
Bengal this would mean that the next sitting of the Assembly must be held before February 2, 1968_

_Fixing December 18 as the date for convening the next session of the Assembly is, therefore,
quite proper since it is within the six months prescribed under Article 174 (1)._

_The Governor can take no notice of statements made by any Members of the Legislature that
they no longer support the Council of Ministers. There is only one constitutional method of indicating
lack of support to the Government and that is by a vote in the Legislature._

_The view advanced by the Union Law Ministry about the Governor's power to dismiss the
Ministry is clearly incorrect. The Governor has no such powers; only the President can dismiss the
Ministry in a State when he takes action under Article 356 of the Constitution, and that too on the
advice of the Prime Minister and his Council of Ministers._

\ 

\ 

The reported view of the Law Ministry,
firstly, that the Governor is
Vested with power to dismiss a Ministry
and, secondly, that in contrast
he does not have power to
question a Ministry regarding a date
fixed for convening a Legislative
Assembly raises some very important
constitutional questions.

At the centre of the controversy
is the scope of the power given to
the President of the Union of India
and to the Governor of a State. Is
the President (or Governor) merely
9 constitutional head or is he vested
with any special discretionary
powers?

Now, the Constitution provides
that all executive power shall be
vested in the President, Art 53(1);
then under Art 14(1), "There shall
be a Council of Ministers with the
Prime Minister at the head to aid
and advise the President in the exercise
of his functions".

Further, under Art 75(3), "the
Council of Ministers shall be collectively
responsible to the House of
the People". The provisions governing
the powers of the Governor
and his Council of Ministers are similar.

Now the question is: supposing as
a result of 50 members of the Congress
Party crossing over to the
side of the opposition, the Congress
Party is reduced to a minority in
the Lok Sabha; then will it be open
to the President, on being informed
by 50 members that they have
'crossed over', to dismiss Indira
Gandhi's Ministry and ask someone
else to form a Ministry?

# No Discretionary Powers

According to my understanding
of the Constitution the President has
no discretionary power at all but in
relation to all actions he takes has
to act on the advice of his Council
of Ministers.

Now in regard to this matter, it is
useful to recall the discussions in
the Constituent Assembly. Here is
the relevant extract:

>Shri H V Kamath: If in any
>particular case the President does
>not act upon the advice of his
>Ministers will that be tantamount
>to a violation of the Constitution
>and will he be liable to impeachment?
>
>The Hon Dr Ambedkar: There is
>hot the slightest about it.

This position was confirmed by
Sri Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer when
he was asked the same question.

In September 1951 President Rajendra
Prasad sent a note to the
then Prime Minister, Pandit Nehru,
in which he expressed his desire
to act solely on his own judgment
independently of the Council of Ministers,
when giving assent to Bills
and certain messages to Parliament
and when returning Bills to Parliament
for reconsideration. Panditji
sent the President's views to
Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer and the
then Attorney General, MC Setalvad,
for their opinion. Both these
high constitutional authorities gave
the same answer independently.
Setalvad wrote to Pandit Nehru that
"by Article 74(1) the President is
required to act in all matters with
the aid and advice of his Council
of Ministers". Setalvad pointed out
that this is so because sovereignty
lies with the people and because
"the people" elect Parliament, from
which comes the Council of Ministers,
power lies with the Council of
Ministers, not with the President.

Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer was
equally direct. He wrote that it was
"perfectly clear that the President's
position was analogous
that of "a constitutional monarch in
England ... and there is no sphere
of his functions in respect of which
he can act without reference to the
advice of his ministers" He also
stated that Art 74 was "all pervasive"
in its character, and it would
be "constitutionally improper for
the President not to seek or not to
be guided by the advice of his Ministers"

# Position Accepted by Supreme Court

This position has also been accepted
by the Supreme Court in its
decision in Ram Jawaya vs State
of Punjab (AIR 1955 SC 549):

>In India, as in England, the
>executive has to act subject to the
>control of the legislature; but in
>what way is this control exercised
>by the legislature? Under Article
>53(1) of our Constitution, the executive
>power of the Union is vested
>in the President but under Article
>75 there is to be a council
>of Ministers with the Prime Minister
>at the head to aid and advise
>the President in the exercise
>of his functions. The President
>has thus been made a formal or
>constitutional head of the executive
>and the real executive powers
>are vested in the Ministers or the
>Cabinet.
>
>The same provisions obtain in
>regard to the Government of
>States; the Governor or the Rajpramukh,
>as the case may be,
>occupies the position of the head
>of the executive in the state, but
>it is virtually the council of Ministers
>in each State that carries
>on the executive Government. In
>the Indian Constitution, therefore,
>we have the same system of Parliamentary
>Executive as in England
>and the council of Ministers
>consisting, as it does, of the members
>of the legislature is, like the
>British Cabinet. 'a hyphen which
>joins, a buckle which fastens the
>legislative part of the State to
>the executive part'.

If the position of the President is
analogous to that of the King in
England, reference to English practice
is also useful. CF Strong in
his book "Modern Political Constitutions"
has put the matter this
way:


>The Cabinet in Britain is,
therefore, dependent upon the
good opinion of Parliament, which
under modern conditions means
the confidence of the House of
Commons. This implies that the
ultimate control is in the hands of
the electorate. As Walter Bagehot
acutely pointed out, the Cabinet
is a creature but, unlike all
other creatures, it has the power
of destroying its creator i.e. the
House of Commons. For if the
Cabinet is defeated in the Commons,
it can, instead of resigning,
advise the Queen to dissolve
the assembly upon which it depends.

So also HRG Greaves has stated:

>The Prime Minister wields the
supreme power of dissolution and
thus holds the security of Members
on both sides of the gangway
in the House in his hands.

From this it is clear that it is entirely
a matter for the Prime Minister
and the Council of Ministers
of which he is the head to decide
what should be done if the party
headed by the Prime Minister is reduced
to a minority. It is open to
him to advise the President that he
should call an opposition leader and
request the latter to form a Government;
or he can advise the President
to dissolve Parliament in exercise
of his powers under Art 85(2)
(b) of the Constitution. In either
case the President has no discretion
to act except on the advice of
his Council of Ministers headed by
the Prime Minister.

All that has been written about
the President applies with equal
force to Governors. A comparison
of the position of the President
under Part V of the Constitution
and the position of Governors under
Part VI will show that the powers
given to them are the same and
that there is virtually no distinction
between the relationship of the President
with his Council of Ministers,
headed by the Prime Minister, on
the one hand and the Governor with
his Council of Ministers, headed by
the Chief Minister, on the other.
The only exception can be found
in Art 239 (2) and Schedule VI.
Under Art 239(2) of the Constitution,
when the President appoints
the Governor of a State as the administrator
of an adjoining Union
Territory, his function as such Administrator
will be exercised independently
of his Council of
Ministers. Then under the clauses
9(2) and 18(2) of the VIth
Schedule certain powers are
trusted to the Governor of Assam
which are to be exercised "in his
discretion". Outside these discretionary
powers there is no scope
whatsoever for action to be taken
by a Governor, independent of the
advice of his Council of Ministers.

# Constitutional Position

To come to the concrete position
in Bengal as it stands today, the
constitutional position would be as
follows:

(1) The power of the Governor
to prorogue and convene a session
of the House of the Legislature has
to be exercised only on the advice
of his Council of Ministers.
(2) The only limitation regarding
fixation of the date of convention of
any House of the Legislature is that
six months shall not intervene between
the last sitting in one session
of a Legislature and the first sitting
in the next session. In Bengal this
would mean that six months from
August 2, 1967, the date of the last
sitting must not elapse before the
next sitting; i.e. the next sitting
must be held before February 2, 1968.
(3) Fixing December 18 as the
date for convening the next session
is quite proper since it is within the
six months prescribed under Art
174(1).
(4) The Governor can take no notice
of statements made by any
members of the Assembly that they
are no longer supporters of the
Council of Ministers. There is only
one constitutional method of informing
lack of support or change of
front, and that is by vote in the
legislature. Hence, for members of
the Legislature to run to the Governor
(or President) and inform
him that they have crossed over is
not a course or conduct sanctioned
by the Constitution.

All that the President (or Governor)
when faced with such a situation
should do is to refer these
gentlemen to the Prime Minister (or
the Chief Minister of the State).
And then the Prime Minister (or
Chief Minister) will take whatever
action is open to him under the
Constitution which is to convene
the Parliament (Assembly) in accordance
with the limitations under
Art 85(1), [Art 174(1)].

It is to be noted that British practice
specifically permits the Prime
Minister utilising his position either
to delay or speed up the dissolution
of Parliament from the point of
view of the political benefit that he
and his party may get from either
delay or speed in such action. It is
well-known that a Prime Minister
is expected to choose a "proper"
time for dissolution of Parliament
and appealing to the people. And
it is considered to be the height of
political wisdom to choose an appropriate
time and the height of
political stupidity to time this erroneously.
This may apply with equal
force to our country also.

# No Power to Dismiss Ministry

So far as dismissal of the Ministry
is concerned, I do not think
there is any provision of the Constitution
which grants the Governor
such power. It may be that the
Law Ministry in giving its interpretation
located this discretion
vested in the Governor under Art
164(1) where it is laid down that
"Ministers shall hold office during
the pleasure of the Governor". From
this a plausible argument might be
built up that the Governor may dismiss
his Ministers if he feels go
inclined.

But it has to be noted that Art
75(2) also lays down that the Ministers
of the Union shall hold office
"during the pleasure of the President"
and surely it cannot be suggested
that so far as the Union is
concerned, the President has any
power to dismiss the Ministers and
to act in relation to any constitutional
crisis against their advice.

In truth, a Council of Ministers
that has been reduced to a minority
in Parliament or a Legislative Assembly
is faced with two alternatives:

They can advise dissolution and
face a mid-term election; or they
can advise the President (or Governor)
to call the Leader of the Opposition
party which possesses a majority
to form a new Council of Ministers.

But the President or Governor in
any event will have no discretion
to compel the Prime Minister (or
Chief Minister) to act in the way
in which he wishes him to act.

At this stage it is necessary to
note one fundamental difference
between the position of President
and the Prime Minister and the
Governor and his Chief Minister.
This is contained in Part XVIII of
the Constitution.

Article 356 in Part XVIII provides
that when situation has
Arisen in which the Government of
a State cannot be carried on in
accordance with the provisions of
the Constitution, the President may
assume to himself any of the functions
of the Governor of the State.

This gives the President, acting
again only on the advice of his
Council of Ministers, the power to
intervene and dismiss a Ministry
in a State by assuming to himself
the powers of that Ministry.
He then directs the Governor to
act On his behalf and governs
through the Governor.

It is, of course, open to the President
acting on the advice of his
Council of Ministers to resort to
this extraordinary and emergent
provision in the case of West Bengal.
But it is difficult to appreciate
how the present position in
Bengal would bring itself within
the scope of Art 356 and justify
a statement that a situation has arisen
in which the Government of that
State cannot be carried on in accordance
with provisions of the Constitution.
Of course. if the Chief
Minister and his Council of Ministers
refuses to convene the Assembly
within the six months period
mentioned in Art 174(1), it could
be said that such a situation has
arisen, and then the President would
be justified in resorting to the
emergency Powers.

But that is admittedly not the
case. And all the talk about the
break-down of law and order
Bengal surely does not provide
proper ground for holding that the
Government of the State cannot be
carried on in accordance with the
Constitution. The Ministry may be
criticised for its acts of omission
OF commission and even severely
criticised for them. But it is a totally
different matter to hold that
the Government of the State cannot
be carried on in accordance
with the constitution.

This analysis will show that the
point of view put forward by the
Law Ministry regarding the Governor's
right to dismiss the Ministry
is clearly incorrect. The Governor
has no such power; only the
President has this power when he
takes action under Art 356 of the
Constitution, the emergency provisions,
and that too on the advice
of the Prime Minister and his
Council of Ministers.

I think it needs to be appreciated
that so long as Part VI of the
Constitution is in operation, the
Chief Minister and his Council of
Ministers are supreme inside
their State as the Prime Minister
and his Council of Ministers are
supreme for the Union. Or course,
the Chief Minister and his Council
cannot usurp the powers of the
Prime Minister and his Council of
Ministers as their exercise of power
is limited under the Constitution in
terms of Part VI and the appropriate
legislative lists.

# Violation of Constitution

But subject to this limitation, I
do not see any area where the
Governor can interfere with the
exercise of this power. On the contrary
he is bound to act in the
manner in which they advise him
and if he does not so act he would
be acting in violation of the Constitution.

I have not attempted to deal with
the political implications of the reported
decision of the Governor of
West Bengal to dismiss the Ministry.
I think it is obvious that any
such decision would be fraught with
the gravest political consequences.
The recent powerful demonstrations
held in Calcutta in support of the
Ministry are enough evidence. I
think it is obvious, therefore, that
both from the point of view of political
and constitutional legality, it
would be thoroughly inappropriate
and illegal for Dharma Vira to dismiss
his Council of Ministers in
Bengal.
