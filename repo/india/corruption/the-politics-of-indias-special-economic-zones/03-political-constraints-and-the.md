# Political Constraints and the Hedging of Political Risk

Regardless of one's view of the merits of India's brand of economic reform, or the
wisdom of the pacing and sequencing of its various elements, the gradually shift
over the past quarter century to a more market-oriented economy, with a larger
role for the private sector and much greater openness to the world beyond India,
has generated considerable --- if fluctuating --- political resistance. How opposition
has been so successfully managed is a matter of some disagreement.
Varshney, for instance, has pointed to the tendency of reformers to avoid taking
policy decisions that would impinge on the lives of ordinary Indians; in doing so,
they have left the domain of 'mass politics' relatively untouched by liberalization.
(In exchange, identity-based mobilization --- and the shifting political coalitions to
which it has given rise --- has helped to insulate policymaking from the vagaries of
mass politics.) [^/9] Jenkins, while granting the less-than-aggressive nature of India's
reform efforts in many respects, has stressed the capacity of India's democratic
institutions, and the politicians and parties that operate within them, to undercut
key sources of resistance --- by fragmenting opposition to reforms, by shifting
blame and political burdens away from those who take key reform decisions, by
sequencing policy measures in ways that forestall political confrontations until
more propitious circumstances prevail, by brokering agreements between
contending interests, and by efficiently steering compensation to the most
potentially disruptive groups among reform's 'losers'.[^/10] In other words, even if
reform is not all it's been cracked up to be, and even if reformers benefited from
the salience of non-economic cleavages which prevented anti-reform groups
from coalescing into an effective electoral bloc, India's liberalizers still faced an
uphill task and have been surprisingly agile in achieving the results they have to
date.

Perspective', in Jeffrey D. Sachs, Ashutosh Varshney, and Nirupam Bajpai (eds), _India in the Era
of Economic Reforms_ (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1999).

How, then, can we interpret the introduction of the SEZ policy in light of the
political dynamics that have attended India's reform trajectory since 1991 --- or
indeed since 1980, or 1984, or whichever of the watershed dates is used to mark
the onset of liberalization? [^/11] Does the ardent pursuit of a far-reaching SEZ policy
--- in which catering to the global market and welcoming foreign investors are
highly visible features --- signal a retreat from the political caution that, by most
accounts, has characterized India's reform process to date? Has India's
accelerated growth rate of recent years --- or the disarray in which opponents of
liberalization have found themselves after a decade and a half of creeping
marketization and globalization --- emboldened reformers to take greater political
risks? Because the SEZ Act contains provisions with an impact on so many
aspects of economic policy; because its implementation requires the involvement
of so many government departments and levels of the political system; because
it touches on sensitive political issues (such as land-ownership) --- for these and
other reasons it is the kind of legislation that one would have expected any
democratic government, but particularly one with a reputation for political timidity,
to be highly wary of championing.

Upon further reflection, however, it becomes apparent that the very nature of the
SEZ policy requires us to ask the opposite question as well: is not the defining
characteristic of the SEZ policy --- the limit of its geographic extent --- an indication
of the continued risk-aversion of India's reformers? If the Government of India
were so confident of its ability to press ahead with a bold and comprehensive
programme of liberalizing measures, why have not, for instance, the floodgates
been opened to foreign investment in the country at large, rather than in a few
small enclaves? If the efficient operation of an industrializing society requires the
firm hand of a 'Development Commissioner', under whose authority a huge
number key decisions could be rendered --- as is envisaged for SEZs --- why not
introduce the governance reforms contained within the SEZ Act to _all_ of India? If
firms operating in SEZs, and the residents who will enjoy their social amenities,
are so certain to benefit from streamlined regulatory procedures, is not the
government's unwillingness to cut red tape with similar zeal in the rest of India an
admission that it is prevented from doing so by the realities of democratic
politics?

8 April 2006.

Paradoxically, the answer to these two sets of seemingly contradictory questions
is --- with important qualifications --- 'yes'. The SEZ policy reflects both the full-throttle
reformist ambition of liberalizers at the apex of the political system (and
not a few of those operating at the state level and below) as well as the very real
and stubbornly persistent constraints that a liberal political system imposes. This
is, in fact, just one of the paradoxes thrown up by India's SEZ policy. For
instance, while SEZs are geared towards attracting foreign investment, by far the
largest share of political protest has concerned the actions of domestic firms
seeking to develop them. Or consider the fact that, while the initial development
of an SEZ may take place through a single-window approval process, the actual
governance of an SEZ, once up and running, is likely to furnish a wide array of
state officials huge scope for discretionary decision-making.

The fact is that, even if SEZs have in practice brought economic reform directly
into the arena of mass politics --- most notably, by permitting state-facilitated
industrialization to intrude directly into the agrarian sector through the process of
land acquisition (as opposed to indirectly through shifts in the terms of trade) ---
the process has been one in which established techniques of political
management have been clearly in evidence. Even the arrival of the first round of
SEZ policy through the backdoor of the Exim Policy was consistent with the
stealthy tactics through which earlier rounds of reform have been introduced in
India.

SEZs in fact represent a relatively attractive way, politically speaking, of
introducing reforms that the Government of India (and state governments) have
otherwise felt politically constrained from undertaking. To the extent that they
create new industrial townships, for instance, the SEZ policy is a convenient
means of overcoming the huge obstacles (bureaucratic and legal, but ultimately
political) to urban redevelopment. Barriers range from the diversity of agencies
and authorities with overlapping jurisdictions (each with its own set of entrenched
political defenders), to outmoded legislation like the Urban Land Ceiling Act and
the Rent Control Act (each of which, again, has proven extremely difficult to
revise). [^/12] Promoting SEZs are also an attractive option given the legal disputes ---
often traceable to political gridlock --- that have tied up so many other brownfield
industrial sites. The provisions of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special
Provisions) Act 1985 and the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial
Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act 2002 make such lands more or
less unavailable for industrial development. [^/13]

Commercial Capital: Maximum City Blues', _The Economist_, 30 August 2007. In the article, Anand
Jain, a partner in the Ambani mega-SEZ in Mumbai is quoted as saying: 'Why do they worry
about my bloody SEZ? ... Why not have ten SEZs and solve all Mumbai's problems?'

To use a different example, should not the SEZ policy be seen as a response to
the failure of the Electricity Act 2003 to generate the anticipated flood of new
investment in this crucial infrastructure sector? Most of the blame for this failure,
it has been argued, is attributable to the refusal of state governments to
relinquish control over their State Electricity Boards. [^/14] SEZ policy thus reflects
the constraints on policymakers as well as their striking ambition.

The possibility that the implementation of India's SEZ policy would encounter
political opposition was not unanticipated by the politicians and party strategists
who weighed the risks and decided to make SEZs a priority on the UPA
government's legislative agenda. Despite the potential hazards, pursuing the
SEZ policy was considered politically _feasible_ by the managers of economic
reform for a number of reasons. (This is distinct from why it was considered
politically _desirable_ in the first place --- notably (a) the ability to favour well-funded
business interests, and (b) the opportunity to introduce policy changes that were
considered too politically risky to undertake on a country-wide basis.)

First, the SEZ policy would be considered of mainly elite interest --- it would attract
the attention of policy analysts, people concerned with trade and investment,
business associations, and the financial press. Discussion of the various policy
questions involved in the establishment of SEZs would, over time, grow highly
technical. For instance, debates over the long-term revenue implications of
sector-specific SEZ implementation would hinge on the details of complex
forecasting models. It was reasonable for the UPA's political strategists to
predict that even politically engaged people --- let alone the great mass of ordinary
citizens --- would grow tired of these debates. The policy agenda would move on.
More visible events and controversies would come to the forefront. This is to
some degree what happened: during the two years following the Act's passage,
newspaper headlines, parliamentary maneuvering, and political agitations
focused on such hot-button issues as OBC reservations in educational
institutions, the remnants of the Bofors case, the Indo-US nuclear cooperation
agreement, and so forth. Perhaps, objectively speaking, ordinary people _should_
have recognized (and given priority to opposing) the inherently regressive nature
of corporate tax 'giveaways' through the SEZ policy, or the cuts in government
spending they would imply. But like the Bush administration's tax reformers, the
political managers of India's liberalization program were reasonably confident
that the issue could be massaged.

Second, strategists in Delhi expected resistance to the SEZ policy to be
fragmented --- in two senses: it would be (a) _geographically_ dispersed; and (b)
divided on the _basis_ of the opposition. As a geographically limited policy
implemented, by definition, in carefully demarcated areas, the most immediately
affected constituencies (and therefore the potential sources of political
resistance) would be of a localized nature. Those opposed to SEZ
implementation in any given location would be isolated within a relatively
contained area where the political fallout could be minimized. They might attract
sympathy from social activists from surrounding areas, or perhaps elsewhere, but
would find it difficult to recruit dedicated allies, whose preoccupations would
naturally be with issues of much broader scope. Even if protestors from different
SEZ sites within a state could somehow join forces, those from different states
would face barriers of distance, language, and political priorities.

Moreover, the _basis_ for opposition to the SEZ policy would vary from place to
place, from group to group, and between individuals. At the time the draft
legislation was being discussed in 2005, it was apparent enough that, while some
critics were concerned almost entirely with specific aspects of the policy (tax
concessions that were considered too generous, or too unconditional, or too
biased toward certain sectors), others were opposed on broad ideological
grounds, seeing in SEZs a Trojan horse for a new wave of liberalizing reforms
that would spread to the country at large. Still others were opposed to the timing
of the SEZ policy's introduction, insisting that improvement to the conditions
facing agriculture should be made before a big push toward industrialization --- on
land that farmers would be required to sell under indirect duress --- was attempted
via the SEZ approach.

Faced with such a disunited array of political opponents, the government foresaw
the possibility of addressing the complaints of each group individually and
serially, picking off discontented constituencies one at a time, as it were.
Ideological opponents who considered SEZs further evidence of the
government's embrace of 'market fundamentalism' would be neutralized by the
UPA's concurrent efforts to tackle the iniquities of liberalization by passing the
National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. To those who worried that SEZs
would emerge as areas where labour rights and environmental protections were
progressively eroded the government could point to its commitment to
transparent governance, manifested in its enactment of Right to Information
legislation. Critics of the SEZ's policy design --- on minimum or maximum area
requirements, on the structure of tax concessions, on compensation issues ---
could be engaged with (or not, depending on how vocal and effective their
opposition turned out to) through the process of policy revision.

Third, political strategists in Delhi felt justified in expecting political resistance to
be manageable because of the assistance they were likely to receive from state
governments in managing the process of policy refinement and implementation.
Most state governments, it was clear, would be eager to attract SEZ promoters to
their jurisdictions --- because they wanted to create jobs and build their
economies, and for less public-spirited reasons as well. Political managers in
Delhi were confident of the ability of states to arrange accommodations between
contending groups. States possessed both skills and incentives to ensure that
whatever varieties of political discontent arose would be contained. India's
history of accommodative politics has inculcated a fairly widespread belief that
where public decisions create 'losers', such groups could be compensated to the
extent that political expediency required. [^/15] (This belief is consistent with the
political assumption of neoliberal policy advocates, who are not unaware of the
dislocations policy shifts can cause, but tend to argue that adversely affected
interests --- or at least a sufficient proportion of their number --- can be won over
with compensatory adjustments.) [^/16] After all, interest groups in India are routinely
drawn into negotiations over legislative provisions, policy design, institutional
structure, administrative rules and so forth. The Indian state's extensive
experience at brokering such agreements instilled confidence that
accommodations between contending interests (namely, farmers and industrial
promoters) could be arranged.

Finally, from the vantage point of political strategists in Delhi --- a relatively small
group of advisors whose views are coordinated in the PMO, which retains a good
deal of decision-making authority --- the SEZ policy would be relatively immune
from charges that it was copied from the Bretton Woods recipe book. Indeed,
India's SEZ policy could be rhetorically positioned _vis a vis_ the Chinese economic
success story. SEZs were, from 2000 onwards, sold by Maran and others as a
necessary weapon in India's struggle to match China's economic might.
Whatever its idiosyncrasies, the SEZ Act 2005 was to be portrayed as an
adaptation of Chinese methods of economic growth --- and as part of an east
Asian model more generally. Not surprisingly, state governments too began
justifying their SEZ policies in terms of replicating the Chinese model. [^/17]

The SEZ policy should, therefore, be seen as an attempt to continue the process
of managing India's reforms (and the integration of India into the global economy)
in ways that would prevent a hostile and potentially debilitating political backlash.
Because the SEZ Act was specifically intended to create enclaves in which the
applicable legal regime would diverge from that prevailing in the rest of India, its
passage was an explicit recognition that it was not politically feasible for the
policy measures contained therein to be implemented on a nationwide basis.
That the political risk of pursuing fairly radical policies within defined geographic
zones was nevertheless considered by India's ruling coalition to reside within
manageable bounds points to a belief that the SEZ Act represented a logical
extension of the strategy of cautious political management pursued since 1991.

The SEZ policy was, in other words, a hedged bet --- demonstrating a recognition
of political and institutional constraints, but also a degree of confidence in the
state's capacity to extend the boundaries of the possible.
