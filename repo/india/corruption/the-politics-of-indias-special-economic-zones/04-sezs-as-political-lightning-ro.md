# SEZs as Political Lightning Rods

The passage of India's SEZ Act by parliament, which proceeded with relatively
little serious opposition, was not without controversy. Though muted in some
respects, criticism of India's SEZ policy partly centered on the deviation of India's
approach from the standard (internationally recognized) paradigm, along the
lines outlined in Section II, above.

There was of course the usual ideological opposition to what was seen as further
entrenchment of a market-friendly (or excessively pro-business) economic
framework. This emerged mainly from the left, but also from some remaining
_swadeshi_ voices in the Sangh Parivar. This was combined, in some instances,
with the complaint that India's SEZ approach was not following the standard
pattern: if export-oriented enterprise zones had to be created, why could they not
be developed by the public sector? The accusation was more polemical than
anything else --- since such zones were seen as a distraction from more pressing
policy concerns in any case --- but they provided an opportunity to ask why India's
governing elites had so completely lost their faith in the state.

Another complaint centered around the failure of the proposed policy to prioritize
the rectification of regional inequalities within and between states. Given the
UPA government's purported concern with this problem --- not least because it
tends to be blamed on, and therefore undermine political support for,
liberalization --- it seemed fair game to wonder aloud why the incentives provided
in the SEZ policy were not being designed as a mechanism to steer investment
toward less desirable regions.

Worries about the revenue implications of the SEZ policy were evident from the
very beginning of the process. The concerns expressed by the finance ministry
became a central theme of the debate, seized upon by people of almost all
political stripes. These continued throughout the implementation phase, and
have, if anything, increased in intensity --- partly because more sophisticated
models for measuring the impact of the tax concessions have been developed,
and partly because the scale of the response to the SEZ policy has made the
absolute numbers involved so large.

Indeed, one of the most common criticisms of India's SEZ policy has been that its
tax-incentive provisions will cause the government to forgo revenue that it call ill-afford
to lose. This point has been made, in one form or another, by well-respected
economists, including, for instance, former IMF chief economist
Raghuram Rajan. While releasing the IMF's _World Economic Outlook_ for
2006[^/07], Rajan, who is generally careful in his statements and not given to
inflated rhetoric, called the tax provisions a 'give away'. His concern was twofold:
that the incentives would distort economic activity away from other (Domestic tariff area, DTA) parts of
India, and that it would harm India's overall fiscal position. [^/18]

While Rajan's comments and those of other economists have generally been
measured --- stressing the timing and precise structure of the tax incentives --- the
political environment into which these criticisms have been introduced has been
sufficiently contentious to ensure that the simplified message --- 'tax give away to
the rich' --- has become a powerful rhetorical weapon for opponents of SEZs and
indeed the general direction of India's economic policy.

There are complicating factors, however. In addition to a host of technical
measurement issues, [^/19] there seem to be two points of contention. The first is
whether the revenue that is 'foregone' would actually have materialized in the
absence of the incentives created. Supporters of the concessions say that
without incentives the economic activities (and therefore the taxes thereon)
would not take place, so the idea of foregone revenue is notional at best. Had
the goods not been produced (as they allegedly would not have been had it not
been for the prospect of exports), no tax would have been collected. The other
elements of foregone revenue would derive from potential abuses of SEZ
regulations (as with abuses in other export-promotion initiatives) --- such as when
goods produced allegedly for export are diverted to the Domestic Tariff Area. [^/20]
Critics of the tax concessions say that the 'additional' economic activities are not
additional at all: they would have taken place anyway, though possibly in different
form, and so would have generated tax receipts that now must indeed be
foregone.

A second issue concerns the relationship between the tax concessions in the
SEZ policy and those available under other (exportand non-export-linked)
schemes. Supporters of the SEZ tax concessions say that estimates of foregone
revenue fail to take note of the fact that much of the revenue is notional due to
the likelihood that businesses would have taken advantage of other tax-holiday
schemes had the SEZ policy not been in effect. Critics counter that, if true, this
negates the argument for regarding SEZ investments as 'new', and thus
undercuts claims concerning the size of 'additional' tax-yielding activities created
by SEZs. Either way, the SEZ policy does include one provision that other
schemes do not, which is the foregone tax on the development of the SEZ itself.

A related charge has been that the wrong sectors are getting favoured.
Especially IT/ITeS, which is no longer an infant industry. Of the 366 approved
approved SEZs, 226 are for IT/ITeS. IT/ITeS was doing well already, it has been
argued. It grew by 240% between 2004 and 2007, and the sector was receiving
huge infusions of foreign investment in any case. And the scope for job creation
--- another of the SEZ policy's objectives --- was limited at best. IT companies
were merely shifting into 'mini-SEZs' --- IT/ITeS SEZs need only be one-tenth the
size of most other product-specific SEZs --- as a way of extending tax holidays
due to expire in 2009. [^/21]

Among the criticisms of India's SEZ policy, one line of complaint acquired a
particular resonance in the debate surrounding the passage of the Act, and has
continued to serve as a potent mobilizing platform. Social activists and public-interest
lawyers have voiced deep apprehension that the mode of governance
within SEZs, once these are established, would run counter to the principles of
democracy. This has been expressed in various catchphrases --- SEZ promoters
as the 'new landlord class'; the emergence of 'neo-zamindari' forms of
governance; and the rise of 'corporate colonial rule.' [^/22] Many critics of SEZs
consider them a species of corporate entity designed precisely to slip between
the cracks of government regulation. SEZs are regarded as locations in which
the constraints of fully representative government would not apply. Those who
reside and/or work within SEZs, it is feared, might find themselves in a legal grey
area in which neither the voice of the majority nor the rights of the minority would
receive due recognition. Burman, for instance, points to the lack of clarity
surrounding 'the legal regime affecting the functioning of an enterprise working
within the SEZ.' [^/23]

The creation of distinct zones of governance is not entirely new, there being
distinctions between the forms of government in municipalities and rural areas,
between notified tribal areas and other locations, and between industrial
townships, such as the 100-year-old Tata-run Jamshedpur complex, and other
state jurisdictions. Serious shortcomings have, in fact, been highlighted in the
governance of even smaller-scale industrial sites. [^/24] But never has the creation of
distinct regulatory spaces taken place on such a large scale, in such a short
period of time, and with the expenditure of such vast resources. As Burman put
it, the SEZ Act 2005 provides enormous 'latitude to the concerned governments
to regulate, or more importantly, not regulate the operation of companies within
an SEZ'. [^/25] Burman looks at this from the perspective of corporate governance,
or how firms themselves are governed --- a very important issue in this case,
since it is firms, to a large extent, that will be responsible for governing extensive
areas in which millions of people will have their residences and conduct their
social lives (educating their children, consuming products, conducting religious
worship, an so forth).

At the heart of these concerns are the structures of public-private decision-making
within SEZs. That SEZs are being developed by private-sector firms,
which will act as their managing agents, raises huge questions about how the
zones will be governed. The role of the Development Commissioner, discussed
in Section 11 of the Act, is particularly suspect in the eyes of critics, and even
among some supporters, of SEZs. The Development Commissioner is expected
to act in consultation with representatives of the state government on certain
issues (for instance, certifying compliance with environmental standards), but for
most other matters would exercise something like a combination of legislative,
executive, and judicial powers as the preeminent member of a board of
governors in which the representatives of the SEZ's corporate promoter would
have a disproportionate voice. State governments are empowered to delegate to
Development Commissioners the powers otherwise conferred upon other state
officials.

Press reports and manifestos issued by social activist groups have stoked fears
that state governments are seeking to establish permissive legal regimes for
SEZs. [^/26] Section 49 of the Act is a particular source of worry because it specifies
the central government's ability to notify the non-applicability of any central act
(or rules framed pursuant to any such act) in an individual SEZ or a class of
SEZs. The potential uses to which this provision can constitutionally be put --- not
to mention the willingness to invoke it --- is less obvious than it might appear in the
more fervid imaginings of some activists. But it is a legitimate worry, not least
because of the clear desire of businesses (many of which are seen to have
already circumvented the law in the process of establishing SEZs) to gain
government assent to a further watering down of what are weakly enforced laws
in any case.

Section 23 of the Act is likewise a common point of criticism among opponents of
the SEZ policy. This portion of the legislation empowers state governments to
establish special courts to adjudicate civil cases. That residents and employees
within SEZs will find judicial protections less easy to obtain than they are at
present is, again, a legitimate worry. Though Section 24 of the Act specifies the
right of appeal to a state's High Court, there are reasonable grounds for concern
that these and other provisions of the Act, taken collectively, will erode the rights
of complainants, or provide a forum within which firms operating inside SEZ
bounds would find it convenient to initiate harassment litigation against unions,
activist groups, or others.

[^/26]: For one of the more balanced accounts, see 'Sovereign States', _Business World_, 13 November 2006.

Potentially more problematic from the perspective of democratic accountability is
the seeming exemption of SEZs from the provisions of the 75 th Amendment,
which provides for local participation in municipal governance. How and where
municipal authorities can or will be established in what in some cases will be
newly urbanized areas is not clear. The worry is that the SEZ Act will trump
citizen claims to share in the governance of their localities on the basis of
constitutionally protected systems of representation. Again, the lack of clarity on
this issue has served to incubate a proliferation of scare stories.

In sum, creating parallel zones in which many questions of governance --- and not
just those related to trade, investment, or production --- are subjected to a _sui
generis_ form of quasi-private management will make India's SEZs, in many
respects, 'Special Governance Zones', or SGZs. This term was coined in 1999
by Shang-Jin Wei in a paper presented at a Transparency International (TI)
conference on new methods for combating corruption. An SGZ, in Wei's
rendering, was to be an enclave within a nation-state where experimental
methods for enhancing accountability could be piloted, each zone serving as an
'entry point for a winnable anti-corruption program.' [^/27] Wei's idea struck many
observers at the TI conference as fanciful. But shorn of its emphasis on
promoting more accountable governance, a similar idea is in fact being
attempted on a much larger scale through India's SEZ policy.

While most of the concerns discussed thus far are speculative in nature,
involving problems that might arise once SEZs are up and running, the issue of
direct and immediate relevance to the process of establishing SEZs in the first
phase of implementation has been land. The issue of land --- and particularly of
land acquisition --- has been instrumental in fusing diverse strands of discontent
into a powerful political force. And it is worth noting that many members of the
growing chorus of critics on this issue are far from the usual suspects. One vocal
critic is Rahul Bajaj, now a member of the Rajya Sabha, who claims that the SEZ
policy is being used by real-estate developers to perpetrate, with government
connivance, what amounts to a 'land scam'. [^/28]

In every state in which a significant number of SEZs have been proposed or
approved, local protest groups have arisen around the process of land
acquisition. The nature of the opposition has varied from state to state, in part
because of variations in the approaches taken by state governments to the
question of land availability. But at the core of the protests has been outrage at
the abuses of the Land Acquisition Act, and indeed the perceived subversion of
the original purpose of eminent domain, which was intended to apply to projects
of public importance rather than those involving private profit. There is of course
ample scope for state governments to manipulate what constitutes a 'fair-market
price' for land that is compulsorily acquired. SEZ promoters, and their political
and bureaucratic accomplices, are privy to inside information on the likelihood of
regulatory decisions being taken that will affect the future price of the land in
question.

[^/28]: This view was voiced at a 'Parliamentarians' Forum on Economic Policy Issues', Council for
Social Development, 3 May 2007, New Delhi. Bajaj received support from others, including fellow
Rajya Sabha member PC Alexander, who (like Bajaj) also advocated setting aside a proportion of
the SEZs for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)

On balance it is fair to say that state governments have shown themselves less
politically astute than perhaps the architects of the SEZ program in Delhi had
hoped. Many state governments have embroiled themselves in serious political
controversies. Some clearly expect protests to die down, or do not expect the
protests against their actions to harm them politically. Some state-level ruling
parties have calculated that their days in office are numbered --- apparently the
view of members of the Punjab and UP governments in late 2006 and early 2007
--- and that it was advisable to milk the SEZ land-acquisition process for all it was
worth before leaving power.

A rather more sophisticated calculation is reportedly in play in other cases, where
funds raised through kickbacks on land-acquisition are expected to be put to
good political use at the next assembly election --- on advertising, bribing political
middlemen, and purchasing post-poll independents to secure a working majority.
In some states --- such as Andhra Pradesh --- sites have reportedly been chosen
with caste calculations kept carefully in mind. Groups that have traditionally
voted for the ruling party (or which might conceivably be courted in the next
campaign) are said to have been largely spared the pain of compulsory land
acquisition, even as others have been disproportionately subjected to tactics of
intimidation. This might be thought of as negative clientelism --- selectively
sparing one's allies in exchange for political support, rather than distributing
positive benefits to them.

Even so, as the protests have gained strength and visibility, the ruling coalition in
Delhi has found it increasingly difficult to distance itself from the abuses of state
governments, particularly those effected by Congress governments. It had been
hoped that it would be possible to shift the blame for any complaints onto state
governments that, after all, are responsible for land acquisition, and indeed for
setting various norms for operationalizing the SEZ policy. But much of the ire is
being directed at the centre --- partly because it promulgated the SEZ policy in the
first place (and so opened the door to abuses); partly because it gives the final
approval to projects (and so should be keeping tabs on the sins of state
governments); and partly because it is expected to frame effective regulations
when patterns of abuse become evident.

The most visible case of grassroots opposition to the process of land acquisition
has been in Nandigram, in West Bengal's East Midnapore district, where in
March 2007 violence erupted between the police and protestors and 14 people
were killed. The Nandigram case has become a _cause célèbre_ for anti-SEZ
forces across India. There is considerable controversy concerning what took
place in Nandigram, with the apportioning of blame following largely party lines.
The state-level ruling party's account of events was elaborated in an op-ed piece
by CPI-M MP and Polit Bureau member Brinda Karat. Karat acknowledged that
mistakes had been made, but accused protestors of being largely from outside
the area, motivated by partisan agendas, and supplemented by paid muscle. [^/29]
This version of events has been widely criticized.

But Nandigram is just the tip of a rather larger iceberg. The process of acquiring
land for SEZs has sparked protest in almost every case on record. The abuses
take a wide variety of forms. Documents presented by Orissa state government
representatives at a BoA meeting on 28 September 2006 stated the land
acquired for SEZs in the state would be only on land that was 'waste' or 'barren',
or on land that supported the production of only a single crop. [^/30] Social activists
from Orissa, however, claim that much of the land supports multiple crops.
Either way, the resulting controversy created sufficient controversy to convince
the promoters of an 1800 hectare SEZ to reduce its size by more than 10
percent.

Protests have erupted whether the SEZ developer in question has acquired land
directly from its owners or whether it has relied on state governments to employ
the Land Acquisition Act 1894. Many SEZs have combined the two procedures,
which has further confused the stories emerging from critics. One large firm,
seeking to establish an SEZ near Gurgaon, was alleged to have obtained the
collaboration of the Haryana government in pressuring landowners to sell.
Though the state government had announced that it would not assist the firm in
acquiring land via the Land Acquisition Act, government officials were said to
have threatened landowners with the withdrawal of access to infrastructure, and
informed landowners that their properties would decline in value once the SEZ
eventually came on line due to industrial pollution and reduced availability of
water, both of which would occur as a matter of course, but could also, if need
be, be engineered by government officials. [^/31]

Outrage at the use of similarly underhanded tactics has led to protests against
several SEZ projects coming up in Maharashtra, one of the major sites for SEZ
investment. The Reliance Group's SEZ in Navi Mumbai had attracted not only
public protest over land acquisition, but objections from various government
entities, including the customs and exports commissioner, the revenue
department and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust. The proposed 1900 hectare
Videocon SEZ on the eastern outskirts of Pune has led to repeated protests.
Local farmers have been agitating under the leadership of several opposition
party figures. Their complaint, submitted to the Pune District Collector's office in
May 2007, was a familiar one: that members of a prominent political family in the
state were using both the official land acquisition process --- and informal strong-arm
tactics --- as part of a personal land grab. [^/32]

Indeed, the tendency for protests against land-acquisition practices to seep from
the domain of social activism to that of party politics has provided opposition to
the SEZ policy added bite. The 2007 assembly elections in Punjab in 2007
provided an indication of the extent to which SEZ policy could serve as both a
symbolic issue and a policy question of material concern to directly affected
groups, or those who might fear ending up as such. During the election
campaign, Amarinder Singh's Congress government was consistently and
vehemently criticized by opposition leader Parkash Singh Badal of the Akali Dal
on the 'squeezing' of farmers in the process of acquiring land for SEZs. Farmers
were not getting a fair price for their land; some were being coerced into selling;
the benefits were destined for real estate developers; industrial development in
the state would not be helped. The litany was familiar from other states. The
Congress's electoral loss in Punjab cannot be blamed on its approach to SEZ
implementation, but the issue provided a symbolic focal point for opponents of
what was deemed a callous administration.

The politicization of the land-acquisition protests has in some cases taken on an
_intra_-party dimension. In Haryana, a large SEZ planned for Jhajjar generated
considerable local opposition, and provided an excuse for disaffected political
groups to condemn the (Congress) state government's handling of the issue. In
July 2007 a prominent Congress MP from the state, Kuldeep Bishnoi, went from
implying the involvement of Sonia Gandhi in what he said was a bribery scandal
involving land-acquisition, to outright accusing her of being a 'party to the deal'.
Already established as a party rebel, Bishnoi said that the state's chief minister,
along with Mrs Gandhi and other senior figures from the national party had all
'received money' from a deal they jointly struck with the SEZ promoter. Bishnoi
stated publicly that Mrs. Gandhi had instructed him to stifle his criticisms of the
implementation of the SEZ policy. [^/33] Needless to say these charges, regardless
of their veracity, have been quoted by all manner of SEZ critics.

The lack of party-based opposition to the SEZ policy as a whole (as opposed to
certain features of the Act, or the manner of its implementation) reflects the
dispersal of power among India's major parties throughout the federal system.
Most parties with a significant parliamentary presence are in power in at least
one state, making them prey to the temptations the SEZ policy offers to
governing elites at the subnational level. (This is the story, in miniature, of large
parts of the politics of economic reform in India.) Implicated in the SEZ policy
through their actions as state-level ruling parties, non-UPA parties who might
have been expected to find a reason to rail against the SEZ policy have found
themselves enjoined by minimal requirements of consistency to keep relatively
quiet. This has not constrained them (or indeed UPA parties themselves) from
complaining about _implementation_ of SEZ policy in states where they sit in
opposition.

In Karnataka, the Congress state party unit, currently in opposition, has
repeatedly attacked the BJP-JD(S) government on the issue of acquisition of
SEZ land in Nandagudi. The Karnataka Congress announced its intention in July
2007 --- after the project had been cleared by the Board of Approvals --- to submit
a memorandum to the BoA in protest against the state government's violations of
central implementation guidelines. The Congress president felt obliged to clarify
that, naturally, his party was not opposed to the idea of SEZs, but that obtaining
land from farmers compulsorily, and at unfairly low prices, could not be
countenanced. [^/34] Karnataka's ruling coalition, not surprisingly, did not want to
allow the Congress, which championed the policy in New Delhi, to play both
sides of the fence. Soon after the Karnataka Congress began stepping up its
mobilization on this issue, the parties that make up the state's ruling coalition
announced plans to protest against the UPA government's alleged failure to
provide a coherent framework for the implementation of the SEZ policy. The
highlighting of inconsistencies in party positions across state lines (and between
central and state levels of the political system) is part of a larger trend found
throughout India. In Orissa, where the CPI-M is in opposition, its party members
level some of the same criticisms made of the CPI-M-led government's SEZ
policy in West Bengal. As one state level office-bearer of Orissa's CPI-M put it,
'\[b\]y handing over valuable land to private companies at a throw away price \[the
Orissa government\] will actually end up creating a new generation of landlords.' [^/35]

Of India's major parties, the BJP was perhaps the slowest to grasp the political
potential of the SEZ-land issue, perhaps in part because it was under the NDA
government that the turn toward a new SEZ policy had begun. When the BJP's
leadership finally constituted an intra-party panel to formulate its response to the
SEZ policy in October 2006, the impetus came mainly from state-level units,
which had been heavily criticized by party activists at the grassroots for not
capitalizing on this issue. The party was in power in eight states at that point,
and actively pursuing SEZ investment in all of them, an uncomfortable fact that
no doubt further slowed its response time (just as the UPA's political strategists
in Delhi had anticipated). M Venkaiah Naidu was appointed by party chief
Rajnath Singh to head a panel that would examine the matter. [^/36] The panel's
tepid findings were that the party had been consistent in its insistence that it was
not against the SEZ policy, as such, and was dismayed only at its
implementation by the governments of certain states --- notably those where the
BJP sat in opposition.

In Andhra Pradesh and other states, charges that farmers were being 'forcibly
expelled' from their land --- leveled, in fact, by people with no discernable party
loyalties --- have nevertheless provided a potent tool for political mobilization.
This is partly due to the symbolism involved, but more importantly because of the
opportunity that the land-acquisition process provides for opposition parties to
zero-in on specific locations --- places where the party's organizational resources
can be targeted in pursuit of electoral dividends. The BJP held a strategy
session in early August 2007 on how to address the mounting discontent with the
Congress state government's abuse of land-acquisition procedures. [^/37] It decided
that state and local party leaders should hold fact-finding inquiries (in which the
quasi-official trappings of hearings and reports and witnesses would feature
prominently) to determine whether 'fertile' lands had been acquired for SEZs, in
contravention of government guidelines, and whether duplicitous tactics had
been employed to do so. [^/38] The geographically focused nature of the SEZdevelopment
process --- in which policy grievances are manifested in specific
locales --- provides a strong incentive for opposition-party machineries to focus
their efforts at the grassroots level.

Land issues have been instrumental in forging a broad-based movement
opposed to the SEZ policy because they focus attention on reformers' neglect of
agriculture and the problems of the rural sector more generally. As P Sainath put
it: 'In 60 years we haven't managed --- except in three States --- to push through
any serious land reforms or tenancy reforms. But we can clear a Special
Economic Zone (SEZ) in six months.' [^/39] Ashish Kothari highlights a specific
dimension of land-related agriculture policy that is aggravated by the rush to
create SEZs. Kothari argues that even a less aggressive form of SEZ land
acquisition --- in which 'fertile' and 'multi-cropped' land would be spared mutation
to industrial and commercial purposes --- would still be based on faulty
assumptions. As other land-policy analysts --- not all of them necessarily radical
environmentalists --- have pointed out, land that is officially classified as
'wasteland', and therefore available for development, may have other uses for
the agrarian economy. Such land may be 'degraded', but should not be written
off as 'barren'. Suitably revived, it can serve as grazing land, or can be used for
the provision of fodder, or may be important to soil and water conservation to
surrounding areas.

Finally, it should be noted that not all states have responded with equal
callousness and political ineptitude when it comes to the question of land
acquisition for SEZs. As Aseema Sinha's research has demonstrated, [^/40] India's
history of investment policy (both before and after the advent of liberalization)
reveals that states vary enormously in how they: (a) respond to central reform
initiatives, in terms of both policy frameworks and institutional structures; (b)
balance the interests of rural/agrarian and urban/industrial constituencies (not
least by blurring the edges between these categories); and (c) manage the
political protests (both local resistance and partisan attacks) that arise from their
actions.

Different states indeed pursue different policies on a number of SEZ policy
parameters. Karnataka, for instance, has its own standard for deciding what kind
of land can be acquired: according to the Karnataka Industrial Areas
Development Board, SEZs are permitted to acquire double-cropped (ie highly
fertile) agricultural land, but only 10 percent of the total area may be of this
type. [^/41] The compensation offered to landowners varies considerably across
states as well, as does the credibility of governments that offer it (an issue to
which we shall return in Section VI of this paper). West Bengal, for instance,
pays 30 percent on top of the market rate for lands that are compulsorily
acquired, and a much higher payout to sharecroppers than is required by the
national legislation. It also has extracted more generous, legally enforceable,
promises from SEZ developers for retraining and other facilities. Further detailed
research is necessary to specify differences across India's states (and the
reasons for these differences) in terms of the policy and political responses
generated by the centre's SEZ framework.
