# Government Re-vision of the SEZ Policy

The central and state governments responded to the increasingly politicized
environment surrounding the SEZ policy in a number of ways. The first was
perhaps the most predictable: each abjured responsibility and blamed the other.
Ministries of the central government claimed that they had framed the policy, but
that it was up to states to implement it responsibly. State governments argued
that they had received insufficient guidance from the center, and were being
unfairly victimized by opportunistic politicians looking to fish in troubled waters.

These claims and counter-claims notwithstanding, as the complaints surrounding
both policy and implementation mounted, the central government was forced to
reverse its initial position, which was that the SEZ Rules should not be revised for
a period of two years. The rationale for non-revision had been that stable
expectations were needed if investors were to feel confident enough to commit
the financial resources necessary to establish an initial wave of SEZs. The
political logic soon overtook this stance.

Broadly speaking, there have been three rounds of revisions to the initial set of
SEZ Rules, first framed in February 2006. These have come roughly every six
months. In each round of revision, there have been both formal amendments to
the SEZ Rules and less formal announcements of policy direction, the latter
coming primarily from the so-called Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM). The
EGoM was established, under the chairmanship of Pranab Mukherjee, in mid 2006. The initial impetus was the 'success' of the policy, measured in terms of
the rate at which SEZs were being approved. But more significant, in terms of
inter-departmental politics, were complaints from the Finance Ministry that their
two representatives on the BoA [^/42] were being consistently overruled when they
voiced objections based on their assessments of the revenue implications of
proposed SEZs.

Other issues that over time required clarification included the ability of existing
businesses (operating in the Domestic Tariff Area) to shift their operations into an
SEZ, using existing machinery and equipment; the creation of a regulator who
would determine the extent of newly created SEZ infrastructure to be exempted
from tax on profits; and the area allowed for non-processing related activities
(i.e., housing estates, commercial developments, schools and hospitals, leisure
facilities). The EGoM reached compromise decisions on a number of matters,
and developed procedural reforms to deal with others, in effect allowing greater
input from throughout the bureaucracy on approvals as well as other, post-approval,
decision-making. [^/43] One implication was that many decisions ended up
requiring increased refereeing by the PMO.

The second set of amendments were issued in March 2007. These were notified
just two days after the deaths stemming from the Nandigram protests, but had
been the subject of deliberation since well before then. The government had
begun to have serious doubts about the capacity of states to implement the land-acquisition
portion of the SEZ policy without generating a backlash that would
tarnish the entire effort. It therefore temporarily halted the process of approving
new SEZs while the EGoM examined a range of issues. Within weeks of putting
the approval process on hold, however, the BoA had resumed considering and
clearing SEZ applications. Even observers who were otherwise supportive of the
SEZ concept in principle (recognizing its value both in economic terms and as a
means of adapting to a challenging political environment) considered the
government to be acting in undue haste. The _Economic and Political Weekly_
called the changes to the SEZ guidelines 'piecemeal tinkering.' [^/44] The _EPW_ also
pointed out that the government had still not instituted 'a legally enforceable re-settlement
and rehabilitation' policy that would hold SEZ promoters accountable
for non-fulfillment of any such terms.

At least two of the changes announced during this period were substantial. First,
one provision in the government order issued on 16 March 2007 appeared to
accord the Board of Approvals wide latitude in changing the classification of land
in an SEZ. Second, in early April 2007 the EGoM decided to prohibit the
involvement of state governments in the acquisition of land for SEZ projects. An
_EPW_ editorial portrayed this as 'leaving peasants and landowners at the mercy of
market forces', though many farmers no doubt would have preferred a voluntary
transaction in the market to a compulsory sale engineered by corrupt officials
acting at the behest of even more corrupt politicians. The _EPW_ was on firmer
ground when it claimed that the government was continuing 'to pander to the
whims of SEZ promoters/developers'. One way it did this, in fact, was by
allowing state governments _indirectly_ to assist SEZ developers in buying land
from landowners at below-market prices --- not, in this case, through the Land
Acquisition Act, but as mentioned in the previous section of this essay, by
employing various tactics of intimidation. The government's soft spot for the SEZ
developers was also indicated by the PMO's decision to ask the EGoM to review
the Reserve Bank of India's September 2006 decision to classify bank financing
of certain SEZ projects as equivalent to real-estate lending, which attracts higher
interest rates (i.e., risk premia) than infrastructure projects. [^/45]

The government, eager to at least be seen to be addressing the rising political
discontent, took other largely cosmetic changes in early 2007. It reduced the
proportion of land within an SEZ that could be used for non-processing activities
--- from 65 percent down to 50 percent. This was widely considered still far too
generous to promoters who were using the SEZ policy to subsidize the creation
of mixed-use commercial developments --- including housing, retail, and leisure
complexes --- with export-promotion little more than an afterthought. The other
high-profile policy change, transparently devised to provide the appearance of
getting tough on developers, was to set a ceiling of 5000 hectares on 'multi-product'
SEZs. Not only was this sidestepping the main size issue --- the
proliferation of tiny SEZs that provided easy access to tax shelters but little by
way of world-class infrastructure --- it also made no sense in the context of the
centre's decision to ban state-governments from compulsorily acquiring land for
private promoters. If land was to be acquired through sales in the open market,
why should it matter how large the SEZs were? Observers began to suspect that
the ban on land-acquisition would not last long.

It now seems that, with the passing of another six months, the ban is indeed
being partially lifted. (In at least some states, state land-acquisition processes
never ceased anyway: surveys and negotiations continued, even if the issuance
of acquisition notifications did not.) This third set of SEZ policy changes has not
yet been officially gazetted, but was unofficially agreed by the EGoM at the end
of August 2007. [^/46] It includes a provision that allows states to acquire land
compulsorily for SEZ projects, but only up to a maximum of 30 percent of the
total project area. If private developers are able to acquire 70 percent of the land
themselves, the state government would be permitted to acquire the rest via the
procedures set forth in the Land Acquisition Act. The government also reportedly
considered, but did not act upon, a proposal to prohibit the transfer of
compulsorily acquired land to private developers; the alternative is to offer the
land on long-term leases.

State governments in many cases have revisited their policy frameworks, and
have revised the procedures and standards used in implementing the SEZ policy.
Returned to the Chief Ministership of Uttar Pradesh in 2007, Mayawati wasted
little time before announcing that the state would be framing and implementing a
new set of norms --- partly in response to changes announced in the central
guidelines and partly on the basis of what was perceived to be in the best
interests of the state. The first substantive action taken in this connection was to
put on indefinite hold the plans of the Anil Ambani group to construct an SEZ in
Noida. As approximately 2000 acres of land for the proposed SEZ still needed to
be obtained, and farmers were objecting to the forced sale of land, the
government claimed that it was left with no option but to reject Ambani's
proposal. The state government claimed merely to be following the
recommendation of the committee established under the industrial development
commissioner, which included proposals to tighten tax-exemptions in non-processing
areas of SEZs and to ensure that that stamp-duty remission would
thenceforth take place only at the time of initial registration. [^/47] No one close to UP
politics was in any doubt, however, that the decision on the Noida SEZ was
driven largely by Mr Ambani's political proximity to the Samajwadi Party. This
reinforced the impression that, if (as often claimed by beleaguered chief
ministers) opposition-party support for anti-SEZ protestors was opportunistic,
then the actions of state governments could be equally so.

Other state governments took steps to revise their policy frameworks, particularly
with respect to the permitted size of SEZs, the nature of tax concessions and the
conditions imposed thereon, the sectors that would receive priority in approvals
for proposed SEZs, the type and location of land available for acquisition, the
procedures through which acquisition could take place, the forms and levels of
compensation payable to those from whom land was compulsorily acquired, and
many other matters. Notable among the states where governments felt
compelled to at least be seen to be taking a fresh look at their SEZ policies were
Haryana, Maharashtra, Orissa, and West Bengal. These were also, not
incidentally, the states where some of the most visible and sustained protests
took place.

The constant revision of the SEZ policy should not be mistaken for responsive
governance. It is mainly a consequence of an ill-considered policy initiative that
has generated considerable political resistance. Moreover, the frequency of SEZ
policy iteration gives rise to rent seeking. It provides incentives for private actors
to seek to influence each successive round of policy revision, or at the very least
to purchase inside information in advance of key decisions being formally
announced. The frequent policy changes also create ambiguities that provide
bureaucrats greater scope to exercise discretion: officials are able to cover their
tracks when non-compliant decisions are exposed by invoking the excuse that
the operative policy was a matter of interpretation given ambiguous and
competing policy directives. The awareness that liberalizing policies which
appear to reduce the scope for discretion will, over time, be subjected to iteration
--- and therefore regular opportunities for rent-seeking --- is one of the reasons why
there is not more resistance within the bureaucracy to the shift toward a more
liberal policy regime. For the astute and well-networked official, the state of
'permanent reform' is conducive to the generation of illicit income.
