# India's SEZ Policy

An SEZ is a geographic region within a nation-state in which a distinct legal
framework provides for more liberal economic policies and governance
arrangements than prevail in the country at large, the intent being to stimulate
investment, trade, and employment. Roughly 2,500 SEZs exist worldwide,
spread across 120 countries.[^/1] SEZs are, in theory, supposed to attract large
volumes of investment by providing world-class infrastructural facilities, a
favourable taxation regime, and the benefits of economic clustering. The
benefits for the wider economy are, in theory, more exports, particularly in high-value-added
sectors, and ultimately an increase in the rate of sustainable
economic growth. Employment generation is also often cited as a potential
consequence of an SEZ model.

In the Indian context, the new SEZ policy can be thought of as ushering in a third
generation of economic reforms: while the first two phases were dominated,
respectively, by efforts to liberalize the macro policy environment, and by the
creation of institutions for regulating a market economy, phase three has a
special emphasis on facilitating a global presence for India's largest private
sector firms and rapidly enhancing the physical infrastructure within which such
firms operate.[^/2]

Though India did not pass an SEZ Act until 2005, it has been experimenting with
the concept since the 1960s. The Kandla Export Processing Zone (EPZ) in
Gujarat is said to have been the world's first. This was followed in the 1970s by
the creation of the Santa Cruz Electronics Export Zone (SEEZ), which in the
1980s was expanded to include gems and jewelry. The 1980s also saw the
creation of EPZs in Noida, Chennai, Cochin, and Falta (West Bengal), followed
by the Vishakhapatnam EPZ in 1994. Immediately thereafter, also in 1994, the
policy was revised to permit (in addition to the central government) state
governments, autonomous agencies, and private-sector firms to develop and
operate EPZs. A private sector EPZ in Surat was the first to emerge under the
1994 EPZ policy.[^/3]

But India's push toward a more comprehensive SEZ policy began in earnest
following a visit by then-Commerce Minister Murasoli Maran to China in 2000.
Hugely impressed by what he had seen in China's SEZs --- and by discussions
with Chinese officials --- Maran acted quickly to initiate a change in India's policy
regime. This took the form of new SEZ rules notified in the Commerce Ministry's
Export-Import Policy of April 2000. This produced a precursor of what would
later become the 2005 SEZ Act. The 2000 Exim Policy converted the existing
EPZs into SEZs. The main difference between EPZs and SEZs concerns
comprehensiveness. Whereas EPZs can be thought of as industrial estates,
SEZs typically contain the fully array of social facilities --- housing, hospitals,
schools, retail developments --- that make up a small city. Moreover, SEZs are
designed to operate on the principle of 'self-certification' on tax-exempt
transactions, whereas EPZs usually require official attestation. Finally, SEZs
tend to be governed by comprehensive legislation, under which far-reaching
regulations are authorized, rather than through notifications and orders issued by
a range of ministries.

Between 2000 and 2005, when the SEZ Act was passed, only three additional
EPZs had been established --- in Indore (MP), Manikanchan-Salt Lake (West
Bengal), and Jaipur. Several states, however, enacted SEZ legislation or
developed policy frameworks within the context of existing legal provisions.
These included relatively under-industrialized states such as Uttar Pradesh,
which under Chief Minister Mayawati passed the UP Special Economic Zone Act
of 2002, and Rajasthan, which enacted rules approved by Chief Minister Ashok
Gehlot in November 2002. On the eve of the 2005 SEZ Act's passage, 811
business enterprises were operating inside the boundaries of SEZs country-wide.

[^/2]: Second generation reforms is a term sometimes used to denote, in general, all the reform items
left over from the first decade or decade and a half of reform. More specifically, it can take on
one of three meanings: (1) the politically difficult reforms that have been sidestepped (labour
reform, thorough fiscal reform, privatization); (2) reforms that will be more inclusive, reducing the
disparities that have given reform an anti-poor image; or (3) reforms to institutions of governance
to make the process of continuous policy change more transparent, predictable, and efficient.

The SEZ Act of 2005 --- and the policy actions and implementation decisions
taken pursuant to the Act --- encompass an enormous range of policy domains.
Beyond trade and investment, SEZs are an instrument of radical deregulation,
infrastructure creation, and changes to the tax regime. The SEZ Act is intended
to furnish a single-window process for obtaining the clearances necessary to
develop an SEZ. This nevertheless affects a huge assortment of government
departments and parastatal entities, many of which are involved in the approval
process. Moreover, the tax incentives offered for SEZ developers, as well as
businesses intending to operate within SEZs, involve provisions that explicitly
alter several other pieces of existing legislation such as the Banking Regulation
Act, the Income-Tax Act, the Insurance Act, and the Stamp Duties Act.

For a major piece of economic legislation with such far-reaching implications, the
SEZ Act 2005 was passed relatively quickly --- just a year after the UPA
government's arrival in power. Its drafters built upon and were influenced by
earlier policy development work conducted under the previous government,
notably the Report of the Steering Group on Foreign Direct Investment, prepared
by the Planning Commission in 2002.[^/4] This report quoted liberally from studies
conducted by management consulting firms (such as AT Kearney, the Boston
Consulting Group, and McKinsey) about problems faced by foreign investors in
India: incorrect information about official procedures, delays in obtaining
approvals, ambiguity about environmental regulations, a lack of clarity
concerning the competencies of state and central agencies, and so forth. The
foreign investment committee's report and other policy documents were inputs
into the process by which the SEZ Act 2005 was formulated.

Under the Act, firms operating within SEZs are attracted not only by the provision
of dedicated infrastructure, but by a package of tax and non-tax incentives that
includes: exemption from export and import duties, excise duties, and central or
state sales tax. Businesses receive tax deductions on 100% of profits and gains
from exports for the first five years of operation within an SEZ; 50% of profits
from exports for the next five years; and up to 50% of profits for a further five
years (i.e. up to 15 years after commencing operations) provided that funds are
credited to a Special Economic Zone Re-investment Reserve Account, the
proceeds of which must be used for approved business activities. The main
requirement that firms must meet to receive these benefits is the maintenance of
a positive Net Foreign Earning position during each of the tax-assessment
periods covered. In addition, firms operating within SEZs need not acquire
licenses for importing capital goods or raw materials, and they can start joint
ventures with up to 100% FDI without the need for investment approval (except
in certain cases, such as armament manufacturing or the production of alcoholic
drinks and tobacco products).

on Foreign Direct Investment (New Delhi, August 2002).

SEZs can be developed by state-level public agencies, private promoters, or a
mixture of the two. It was foreseen by the architect's India's SEZ policy that
private-sector firms would be the main drivers of SEZ creation. Applications for
the establishment of an SEZ are, not surprisingly, a complicated affair, involving
an array of certifications and various forms of proof of intent and competency.
But the approval process takes place via a 'single window,' the Board of
Approvals (BoA) within the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Though in theory
it is possible to submit an application directly to the BoA, in practice firms seeking
to establish an SEZ choose the option of routing their applications through the
state government in whose jurisdiction the SEZ will be located, for without the
support of the state government concerned, a proposed SEZ has little chance of
becoming reality. The BoA operates under a fairly transparent set of guidelines:
the relevant documents are available on the ministry's dedicated SEZ website,
though as with other government processes, the prospects for success rely on
the applicant's grasp of unwritten rules and mastery of political influence-peddling.
[^/5]

As of August 2007, the BoA had given formal approval to 366 proposals and 'in-principle'
clearance to 176 others. Another 268 proposals were 'pending'. Of
these, there are about 170 cases on which the response of state governments is
awaited. [^/6]

In addition to the BoA, the SEZ policy stipulates the creation, for each SEZ, of a
'Unit Approval Committee' (UAC), headed by the state appointed civil servant,
the Development Commissioner. The UAC, consisting of a mixture of private-sector
and government officials (customs authority representatives, for instance)
approves the entry of new business units into a particular SEZ and makes
determinations on the application of other rules (regarding the location of social
facilities, the measurements to be used in determining 'processing area',
environmental clearances, and so forth).

In many countries, SEZs are considered a means of solving certain economic
shortcomings. SEZs have typically been regarded as part of 'regional
development' paradigm emphasizing the benefits of geographic clustering among
firms in a particular economic sector. SEZs have been seen, for instance, as a
means of facilitating more efficient links between consumer-product
manufacturers and their suppliers. The idea has been to promote concentrations
of sectoral expertise in order to kickstart entrepreneurial activity within related
sectors --- that is, to see SEZs as 'regional growth poles' from which an expanding
area of economic dynamism would gradually emerge.

Another highly touted benefit of SEZs has been their ability to create the world-class
infrastructure that firms require in order to make their operations globally
competitive. While governments might be unable to provide high-quality road
and rail systems, communication networks, water-supply systems, or electricity
production and distribution facilities on a country-wide basis, the state could
undertake a program of public-sector investment in a limited number of locations
where the economic payoffs would be largest and most immediate. The ability of
vibrant centers of innovation and production to catalyze a wider process of
economic growth, from which areas beyond the SEZs themselves would benefit,
has been the standard justification for concentrating infrastructure investment in
certain areas rather than ensuring a more even geographic spread.

To yield the desired economic payoffs, however, SEZs were expected to operate
on a large physical scale. A critical mass of firms was required for the benefits of
clustering to manifest themselves. A very large increase in entrepreneurial
dynamism was necessary before localized growth would spread to surrounding
areas. Infrastructural investments would, similarly, be worthwhile only if they
covered a wide enough area.

The Indian approach to SEZs has deviated from this logic to a considerable
degree. Its SEZ policy --- like India's policies in many other fields --- exhibits local
features that distinguish it from what is commonly found in other countries.
India's SEZ Act is different in at least three key respects from the Chinese
'model', which was said to have inspired Murasoli Maran at the beginning of this
decade.

First, and perhaps most importantly, whereas in China it was the public sector
that was overwhelmingly responsible for developing the SEZs, in India this task
has been assigned to the private sector. Private-sector promoters of SEZs have
in many cases partnered with government entities. But by far the greatest share
of the investment capital is coming from the private sector.

The second difference between India's SEZ policy and the internationally
recognized paradigm for SEZ development is the lack of emphasis in India on
using SEZs as a mechanism for promoting under-industrialized areas. India's
SEZs are --- because of the incentives created by the policy design, and the fact
that they are, for the most part, not initiated by government bodies ---
overwhelmingly located in areas that are already highly developed. Almost half
(171) of the 366 SEZs approved as of 31 August 2007 were to be in the vicinity
of major cities. Just nine cities --- Ahmedabad, Mangalore, Chennai, Delhi,
Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Pune --- accounted for 138 of these.
This is a far cry from what took place in China. [^/7] Shenzhen, perhaps the world's
most famous SEZ, was located in an industrial backwater. Subsequent SEZs
have been sited even farther from from China's most developed regions, the
explicit aim being to disperse the economic benefits that have allowed parts of
China to prosper.

[^/7]: The four original SEZs in China were Shenzhen, Shantou, Zhuhai, and Xiamen. For accessible
overviews of the Chinese experience with SEZs, see George T. Crane, _The Political Economy of
China's Special Economic Zones_, (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 1990), and YC Jao and CK Leung
(eds), _China's Special Economic Zones: Policies, Problems and Prospects_ (Hong Kong: Oxford
University Press, 1986).

The third way in which India's SEZs vary from the Chinese model has been in
terms of scale. The SEZ Act 2005 specifies extremely low minimum size
requirement in order to establish an SEZ. The minimum area requirement for
'multi-product' (i.e., non-sector specific) SEZs is 1000 hectares. Sector-specific
SEZs have a minimum area requirement of 100 hectares, with the exception of
those devoted to Information Technology and IT-enhanced Services (IT/ITeS),
which are permitted to be as small as 10 hectares. [^/8] Implementation of the Act, in
practice, has yielded a proliferation of relatively small SEZs. For instance,
Gurgaon --- an enclave in Haryana that has more or less been absorbed into
greater metropolitan Delhi --- has emerged as a major SEZ destination. Ninety
percent of the first 50 SEZs approved in the Gurgaon area were sector-specific,
and of very small size: 36 in IT/ITES, and three each in biotech, textiles, and
gems/jewelry.
