# Overview

India's Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 received the President's assent on
June 23, 2005. Well before the detailed regulations that would govern its
implementation came into force in February 2006, various government agencies
and private-sector actors had begun responding to the Act's provisions. As of
this writing (in August 2007), very little actual construction in those areas officially
designated as Special Economic Zones (SEZs) has taken place, and the policy's
economic and political effects are still a matter of conjecture.

Even so, there is more than two years of fairly robust policy and implementation
history to examine; more than seven years if we include the precursor measures
contained within the Exim Policy introduced in 2000. Policy regimes have been
formulated in various states pursuant to the central SEZ Act, and these (as well
as the Government of India's own SEZ guidelines) have been revised in several
respects on a number of occasions. Moreover, 'implementation' (in the form of
approvals for the creation of SEZs) has moved forward rapidly.

This paper assesses the political dynamics that have arisen in the wake of the
Act's passage. Its larger objective is to determine what these might reveal about
the politics of economic reform in India more broadly.

There are inherent dangers in using a single policy domain to derive
generalizations about processes of much broader scope. This is especially true
of a policy still in its infancy. On the other hand, if ever a single policy initiative
were capable of serving as a microcosm for the politics of reform it would be
India's SEZ Act, which intentionally draws within its ambit such diverse issues as
investment (domestic and foreign), trade, taxation, industrial relations, land-use
and land reform, environmental sustainability, and others of an even more
specialized nature. The Act also affects the policy environment facing state
governments; indeed, it requires their active involvement to achieve its
objectives. There are implications for the functioning of India's system of local
government as well.

The political actors concerned are similarly diverse, including almost all political
parties, a huge range of business interests and associations (each concerned
with the broad policy framework, and many with an intense interest in rules
applicable to their sector), bureaucratic actors with turf to protect, and a
staggering array of movement groups spread throughout India. Many of the
issues involved in implementing the SEZ policy lend themselves to litigation that
will have strong political repercussions, especially where these involve land and
taxation. Some cases are likely to be of constitutional significance.

Such a multifaceted process --- especially one in which the policy regime itself as
well as the economic response and political reactions are still a work in progress
--- militates against the formulation of generalizable findings. Nevertheless, the
story of India's SEZ policy to date would seem to hold at least three important
lessons.

First, in seeking to manage the process by which the SEZ policy has been
introduced, India's governing elites --- indeed its policymaking establishment more
generally, which extends beyond those in positions of direct or indirect state
authority --- have run up against the limits of what can be achieved by practicing
'reform by stealth', or by seeking to insulate policymaking from the effects of
'mass politics'.

Second, the political dilemmas that have emerged in the process of trying to
implement the SEZ policy highlight an important structural weakness of India's
political system at this stage in the process of India's economic transformation:
the increasing inability of the state to broker accommodations that would
advance its preferred policy objectives. This is largely a result of pervasive
corruption and a recent history littered with broken promises --- both of which, it is
worth noting, were integral to the process of reforming by stealth.

Third, the SEZ policy is more than just another case of businesses seeking to
avoid high levels of taxation or to evade onerous regulation. SEZs represent a
desire by both political elites and those who aspire to middle-class status to, in a
sense, secede from the rest of India --- to, in the language of this conference's
framework, escape the consequences of India's recent 'democratic upsurge.' In
the eyes of many social elites and middle-class aspirants, the political
ascendancy of historically oppressed groups threatens to sabotage the dream of
a more prosperous, efficient, and powerful India. That SEZs might offer a way of
permitting the inhabitants of this upwardly mobile India to pursue this dream,
_without the need to emigrate abroad_, while simultaneously creating enclaves
within which foreign economic influence can be quarantined before spreading to
the rest of India, has proven equally appealing to the political wing of India's
Hindu nationalist movement.

The paper is organized as follows: Section II overviews the SEZ concept and the
policy decisions through which it has taken root in India; Section III outlines the
political logic underlying SEZ reform, including how best it might be viewed in the
context of existing theories of how India's reformers have contended with the
constraints imposed by democracy; Section IV examines the forms of opposition
to which the SEZ policy has given rise; Section V summarizes the government's
response; Section VI concludes by elaborating on the three propositions
advanced in this introduction.
