# Implications: Taking Stock of the Politics of SEZs

Looking back at the pattern to have emerged in the formulation of the SEZ policy,
the specification of its content, the calculations concerning its political feasibility,
the resistance that arose in the process of implementation, and the subsequent
attempts at policy revision (both de jure and de facto), three arguments can be
advanced.

The first is that India's reform effort may have reached the limits of what can be
achieved through shrewd political management of the policy process. Partisan
blame-shifting, institutional burden-spreading, reverse forum-shopping, the
purposeful division of adversely affected constituencies, careful policy
sequencing --- these and other techniques for reducing political resistance
(including some that rely on systematic illegality) have over the past decade and
a half been important contributors to India's ability gradually to transform its
economic framework. But this strategic paradigm, which involves the
manipulation of incentives and disrupting the tactical calculus of key interest
groups and individual elites is increasingly unviable as a means of continuing the
process of reform.

The chief irony to have emerged after approximately three years of SEZ policy
formulation, implementation, and revision is that an approach designed to effect
an end run around the legal and political obstacles to furthering India's reform
agenda has ended up generating not only a potentially serious backlash against
the SEZ policy, but a sense of disenchantment about the state's approach to
economic reform more generally --- in particular its lack of attention to the
agricultural sector and its disregard of the rural poor.

India's SEZ policy has created an extremely potent symbol around which
opponents of liberalization --- from grassroots activists to national party leaders
--- have been able to rally. Indeed, one would be hard pressed to imagine a single
action more likely to unite the various anti-reform groups that have for so long
been fighting dispersed battles on a variety of lonely fronts. Had a committee of
anti-reform forces been constituted to devise such a policy measure, the
implementation of which could catalyze a wave of political discontent,
recommending the passage of the SEZ Act would not have been a bad choice.
SEZs have brought economic reform firmly into the domain of mass politics.

The SEZ policy is an attempt to build economic infrastructure and regulatory
capacity within small spaces when it is deemed politically unfeasible to do so on
a national scale. Politicians in the UPA were not unreasonable to believe that the
nature of the policy, and the decentralized means by which it would take concrete
shape, would erect barriers to political resistance. As it happens, this approach
has fueled widespread political discontent. Protest that initially seemed sporadic
and dispersed among far-flung sites (manageable by local officials and state
governments) has coalesced into a pattern of opposition to reform that has cast
the SEZ policy as the poster-child for uncaring globalization.

Over time, complaints about SEZ implementation became so widespread, and
the land-acquisition abuses followed such a predictable pattern, that the central
government's response --- that problems were the result of faulty actions taken by
state governments --- began to ring hollow. The conceptual firewall between
policy and implementation was revealed as spurious: if implementation could be
so consistently abusive, then there must be something wrong with the policy
framework. The defenses against political blame were proving less robust than
the centre's political strategists had hoped, and their faith in the political
management capacities of states was appearing decidedly misplaced.

The second argument is closely related to the first. The political troubles that the
SEZ policy has encountered underscores one of the costs of corruption that has
tended to be overlooked in existing debates. Corruption is typically seen as
exacting a cost in terms of various measures of efficiency --- for instance, by
increasing transaction costs and creating incentives for particularly destructive
varieties of rent-seeking behaviour. [^/48] More recently, an understanding of the
costs of corruption in terms of equity have been highlighted, and have indeed
spurred on forms of anti-corruption activism that seek to reduce the effects of
corruption on the poor. [^/49]

But it has become increasingly obvious that it is the interaction between
efficiencyand equity-depleting forms of corruption that is particularly damaging.
How? Attempts by governments to mitigate the effects of corruption on
segments of the population that have not benefited from liberalization --- the rural
poor in particular --- have often been foiled by a siphoning of funds by corrupt
officials and other middlemen. This is bad in its own right, but is particularly
damaging to the state's ability to build the political consensus required to press
ahead with a reform agenda that seeks to reduce structural inefficiencies in the
operation of the economy. In other words, politically speaking, corruption that
hurts the poor not only undermines equity, it can also harm the prospects for the
creation of a more efficient economy. [^/50]

It is for this reason that the accountability and social-audit provisions of the
NREGA are so important (and why they were given such prominence): this
program is the flagship of the UPA's effort to make peace with the rural poor,
which might otherwise vent its dissatisfaction with elite-oriented reform against
this government, just as it did the last one. Even more worrying precedents for
the UPA are the cases of two state governments --- Digvijay Singh's in Madhya
Pradesh and Ashok Gehlot's in Rajasthan --- that were thrown out of office by
discontented electorates in late 2003 _despite_ the attempts of both governments
to improve conditions for the rural poor. A dispassionate interpretation of these
two electoral outcomes would have to fault corruption in the programs through
which the respective state governments sought to build support among poorer
voters.

This syndrome (of corruption as a constraint on the ability to buy the political
support that risk-taking governments desperately need) is directly relevant to the
fate of India's SEZ policy. In response to the many 'implementation problems'
that have arisen in the SEZ policy --- the charges of systematic bias, the
widespread and persistent political protests --- many recommendations have been
put forward about how grassroots opposition to the policy among affected groups
could be overcome. One business school professor, citing the Chinese case,
advocates a 'well-designed' 'compensation' package for farmers whose land is
acquired. [^/51] (That an authoritarian government's approach to displaced
agriculturists is considered a model of humane treatment compared to what has
been happening in India provides some indication of how badly India's
policymakers have thus far handled this issue.). This kind of compensation
package --- which resembles proposals floated in various think tanks as well as in
the Planning Commission --- would include 'monetary' (payment for land) and
'non-monetary' components, the latter including jobs, housing, and subsidized
healthcare and education.

A compensation-oriented approach to the SEZ policy's land-acquisition problems
would, however, face huge obstacles. Chief among these is the sheer lack of
confidence among ordinary people that whatever compensations are promised
will be forthcoming --- or that benefits will reach the intended beneficiaries. This is
not uniformly true across all classes of people, or all Indian states, or all regions
within states. But a lack of confidence in the government's ability to deliver on its
promises --- which is to say, the state's severely dented credibility --- poses
formidable difficulties.

[^/51]: 'Sizing Up the SEZ Potential', _Indian Express_, 31 August 2007.

Take the case of the large SEZ projects being planned in and around Mumbai.
Several very reputable NGOs working in the city report abuses that conform to
an extremely disturbing pattern. At least 50 cases of forged signatures to obtain
land have been lodged (there is no way to determine how many are legitimate
complaints). One activist made the point that promises of employment were
particularly suspect in the eyes of residents. [^/52] Pledges from SEZ promoters as
well as the state government come in the wake of earlier rounds of broken
promises with respect to land acquisition. In mid 2006 both Sonia Gandhi and
Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar had announced that fertile agricultural land
would not be acquired for SEZs. Yet in Maharashtra the state government
continued acquiring such land for a large SEZ project in Raigad district. Farmers
just outside Mumbai were served with acquisition notices for a combined 28,000
hectares for this SEZ.

The dispute over broken promises in this case, as in others, hinges on the
distinction between productive and unproductive land, which are sometimes
referred to as 'fertile' and 'infertile' land. Most impartial observers will say that
much of the land classified as 'barren' is perfectly productive --- some of it in
practice, most of it potentially. Farmers who have been resisting land acquisition
explicitly referred to earlier episodes where landowners were treated unfairly; the
land acquisition process for the Ispat Denro plant in Raigad and the IPCL plan at
Nagothane loomed large in these accounts. [^/53] It is the memory of these earlier
betrayals that, according to spokespeople from activists groups such as Ekvira
Jameen Bachao Andolan, helps to explain the rallies of up to 30,000 protestors
that have taken place in Pune and elsewhere.

The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), like similar
agencies in other states, has sought to assure landowners that they will be
assigned plots in the SEZs in which the MIDC is an equity partner. The MIDC
has also promised assistance in setting up business units in adjacent areas likely
to undergo rapid development. But given the dismal record of the Maharashtra
government in fulfilling its various promises, is it any wonder that landowners are
not convinced by the assurances offered by MIDC? It is not that farmers are
clinging to land out of some atavistic attachment to real property; they have a
rational belief, based on experience, that promises will not be kept.

In short, the credibility of the Indian state as a broker of effective compromises on
a large scale is so damaged by its repeated failures to stem corruption among
the frontline bureaucracies that would be charged with delivering compensation
packages, that proposals based on compensation find few takers and become
unviable as deadlock-breaking solutions. This is a pathological condition for a
political system that must rely on such accommodations to bring about desired
policy changes.

Some suggest that private-sector firms will be better placed to develop
compensation packages that landowners will find attractive. Private firms may
have image problems, but the kinds of compensation offered would be more
direct, and backed by specific contracts for individuals rather than revocable
policy commitments for classes of landowners, it is argued. (There are several
efforts by private-sector firms to forge direct links with landowners: for instance,
textile firms in Bangalore seeking to establish a sector-specific SEZ have
promised to assist farmers with impartial advice on the process of selling their
land, and to put them in touch with financial advisors on how to invest the
proceeds of such sales.) The shortcoming of this argument is that the contracts
signed between firms and individual landowners would similarly rely on the
enforcement machinery of the state, including a grotesquely corrupt legal system.
The corruption of the Indian state, in short, undermines the confidence required
on the part of people with which the state would like to enter into contracts,
which if concluded could help to buy the political peace necessary to deepen
economic reform.

One example of how bad policy design undermines confidence in the _state-as-broker_
concerns the timing of land contracts and SEZ approvals. When firms buy
land directly from owners, the agreements typically specify that the transaction
will only be consummated with each individual seller once the company has
amassed agreements in principle to buy the aggregate amount of land needed
for the SEZ to go ahead. This would be unproblematic if there was a definite
deadline for amassing the land (and finance and other necessary elements) after
which the agreement would lapse. But because in some purchase agreements
no deadline has been stipulated, this has allowed firms to, in effect, tie up in a
contingent contract land owned by people who find that their main asset is legally
encumbered. This problem has been pointed out to farmers by bankers who
transact business with them on other matters, as well as by opposition politicians
who seek to convince farmers that they have been given a raw deal. That
government rules have allowed what amounts to a relatively one-sided option
contract to continue has further raised suspicions among the public. This further
erodes the trust necessary to forge compensatory policy frameworks. [^/54]

Recent government efforts to arrive a policy compromises on the land issues
related to SEZ development are, if anything, likely to generate even further
suspicion. The 70:30 policy on land acquisition --- which allows state
governments to acquire 30 percent of the land for an SEZ compulsorily if the
promoter is able to acquire the other 70 percent through private-market
transactions --- will in fact enhance the negotiating leverage of SEZ land-seekers
by considerably more than 30 percent. Thanks to this new policy, a landowner
who is approached by an SEZ developer wishing to purchase his land, but who is
reluctant to sell, will be presented with the unattractive possibility of ending up as
part of the 30 percent whose land is compulsorily acquired by the state
government on the developer's behalf. Developers will attempt to convey the
impression to _all_ potential sellers that they (the developers) are close to meeting
the 70 percent threshold. This increases the pressure on landowners to sell to
the developer --- at what the developer will claim is a good price --- out of fear that
the alternative (i.e., what the state government will pay) will be substantially less.
Landowners will want to be part of the 'lucky' 70, rather than the unfortunate 30.
Simply the threat of being subjected to compulsory purchase --- through a state
land-acquisition process that is known to be corrupt, inefficient, and unreliable
--- will exert a downward pressure on the prices available to private landowners.
Industry analysts, not surprisingly, have welcomed the new policy as it will
ensure that 'projects will not be held to ransom' by recalcitrant landowners. [^/55]

[^/54]: This summary emerged from the author's interview with an analyst in a major US financial
institution that has large investments in India, at the Bear Stearns 'Global India' conference, New
York, 5 August 2006.

This 70:30 policy 'compromise' was bundled with a draft 'resettlement and
rehabilitation' policy. But the failure of India's state governments to implement
even Supreme Court-ordered resettlement and rehabilitation policies for people
displaced by large-scale _public_-sector development projects --- notably the
Narmada Dam --- has, not surprisingly, made landowners dismissive of promises
issued under the revised SEZ policy.

Farmers, it should be added, are naturally suspicious of promises made by a
state that has done little to improve the conditions facing agriculture --- a state that
has in effect created the push factors that cause many to consider selling their
land their only option. As Narendar Pani has written, encouraging people to
make the shift out of agriculture means 'providing them economic opportunities
that are consistent with a modern economy,' requiring substantial and well-funded
'initiatives ranging from education to incubators that allow
entrepreneurship to mature.' These cannot be future promises. 'As the protests
over land acquisition grow across the country state governments that want to
avoid social turmoil will have to recognize that people have to be drawn out of
agriculture before their land is acquired and not the other way round.' [^/56]

The third argument to emerge from the SEZ story relates most directly to this
workshop's desire to explore connections between the various dimensions of
India's 'great transformation'. Is there any link between India's experience with
SEZ policy to date and what has been called India's 'second democratic
upsurge'? Arguably the most direct connection is of a negative variety: the
concerns about unaccountable governance within SEZs, outlined in Section IV of
the paper, would seem to paint a grim picture of what India's economic
modernizers consider necessary to ensure its continued prosperity. If SEZs are
a harbinger of what is to come, the democratic gains realized for historically
oppressed groups through one set of institutions could well be reversed through
others. The common worry that democratic principles will be sacrificed in the
operation of SEZs --- just as they have been in the process of establishing them
--- is certainly not without merit. If nothing else, the lack of precision regarding the
applicable legal regime within SEZs on many economic and non-economic
matters is a matter of serious concern. That certain categories of rights will
receive short shrift, either by law or as a matter of practice, is all too easy to
imagine. In particular, there is justifiable anxiety about the legal provisions under
which labour will be regulated --- the full gamut of issues including hiring practices,
security of employment, wage and pension entitlements, occupational health and
safety, the ability to unionize, rights to collective bargaining, and the mechanisms
for resolving individual and class-action disputes.

News for SEZs', _Business Standard_, 1 September 2007.

[^/56]: _Economic Times_, 11 Dec 2006

These legitimate worries notwithstanding, there is a sense in which the emphasis
of this line of criticism --- in which, it is feared, the occupants of SEZs will be
offered a second-rate version of democratic governance --- may miss the
significance of what is taking place. In particular, critics who stress the
democratic deficit seemingly built into the SEZ model of governance may have
misread the relationship between the governance of SEZs and the continued
democratization of India's democracy.

Without doubt, the promoters of SEZs and the businesses that will operate within
them seek to evade the burdensome regulations (and time-consuming
procedural requirements) of India's democratically constituted state. But,
arguably, so do many of the people who will flock to the SEZs. A good
proportion of those who will reside in SEZs, or who will aspire to do so, will be
members of India's middle class. It is for technological and managerial
professionals that the extensive 'social amenities' are being constructed --- not
only housing developments, but a huge array of retail and leisure facilities
designed to attract upwardly mobile members of Indian society. These zones of
relative affluence will offer not merely economic privileges, but in a sense a form
of desirable political exile as well.

In other words, the idea of the multipurpose SEZ, where large numbers of people
will reside as well as work, is premised on a belief that a substantial segment of
India's middle class is eager to escape from India's democracy as currently
constituted. SEZs provide a means for a privileged (but growing) segment of
India's polity to avoid the tumult that characterizes contemporary India, both the
politicization of religious identity and the second democratic upsurge. It is worth
noting that this longing to escape the messy reality of politics may well be
attractive even for people attracted to Hindu nationalism as a form of political
expression, or people from the very social groups whose political ascendancy
constitutes the recent democratic upsurge.

This does not imply that future residents of SEZs will not ideally desire the
protection of law, or the political voice that comes from representative
government. They are, however, likey to be price-conscious consumers of
democracy. There are a great many upwardly mobile, professionally qualified,
globally connected people who consider India's form of politics too chaotic (and
indeed corrupt) to deliver the benefits classically associated with democracy.
The entry into mainstream politics of previously marginalized groups --- people
regarded, even by first-generation members of the middle class, as socially
backward, easily manipulated by populist demagogues, and too often willing to
sacrifice progress at the altar of equality --- has for India's emerging elite made
living amidst India's current democratic dispensation an unattractive proposition.
SEZs offer a form of partial political secession --- in the same way that access to
privatized health and education services allows better-off people to opt out of
(and therefore further impoverish) public provision. Moving to an offshore haven
located onshore may thus constitute the next best thing to emigrating abroad
--- better, in fact, because of the ability to do so while remaining in India. If forfeiting
some of the procedural benefits of democracy is the price of admission, this is a
cost that many Indians may well be willing to pay.

As SEZs move from the drawing board to construction to full operation, it may
well be that we will witness a shift of emphasis among those who currently
criticize SEZs as likely enclaves of undemocratic governance. If even a modest
number of SEZs succeed in generating more entrepreneurial activity, creating
high-paying jobs, building quality business and social infrastructure, and
providing a zone of efficient (if less than fully representative) governance, they
may end up serving an even more sinister purpose than critics currently fear.
Rather than ending up as Dickensian dystopias, SEZs may well serve as a
showcase for the merits of a more authoritarian form of governance. This is
perhaps the most disturbing aspect of these special governance zones. It is not
difficult to imagine political leaders making the case that India's decentralized,
representation-obsessed, procedure-encumbered, judicially-reviewed form of
democracy had become unworkable --- and that its SEZs had demonstrated on a
small scale what the rest of the country should adopt on a nationwide basis: a
streamlined version of governance in which officials and business elites
collaborate to provide effective public services in the context of a long-term vision
of India's economic place in the world. A kind of South Korea in South Asia.

As for the third dimension of India's great transformation --- the rise of Hindu
nationalism as a political force --- there is perhaps less of a direct thematic
linkage. Still, it is notable that when defending SEZs as necessary, some BJP
politicians have spoken of their role in helping to project India's economic power.
SEZs, according to this view, are a means of preparing India's firms for operating
within the foreign environments in which they increasingly will have to do
business --- that is, in the global markets and overseas jurisdictions where Indian
capital's urge for expansion is inevitably taking them.

At least one BJP spokesperson has also advanced the argument that SEZs
would be good for the preservation of the (presumably Hindu) nation by providing
an alternative to the emigration of India's skilled professionals. [^/57] The implication,
of course, is that India is creating its own 'abroad' within its borders --- a
hybridized space that can serve as a functional equivalent of foreign territory. So
rather than SEZs being seen as scars on the nation's sacred geography, they
can be regarded as a symbolic absorption of the world beyond India. Moreover,
SEZs may even help to shield the core of India from what some Hindu
nationalists (and others) decry as the corrupting foreign influences of
consumerism and western lifestyles by quarantining these things, to the degree
possible, within defined enclaves where they can do less harm.
