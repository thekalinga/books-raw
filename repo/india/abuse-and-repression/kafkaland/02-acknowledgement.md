## Acknowledgement

This book is the product of the collective energies of many people. First, my colleagues and comrades at Jamia Teachers' Solidarity Association - Sanghamitra, Sohaib, Adil, Ghazi bhai, Farah, Azra, Ambarien, Bhatt Saab, Nipa, Manoj, Rahul and others --- our work together is at the core of this book.

"Crime and Punishment" and "Sinful Liberals and the Investigative Bias" have been published earlier on the blog _Kafila.org_ (the former as "Delhi Police Special Cell: Encounters, Frame up, Impunity"). A shorter version of the chapter on Malegaon was published in _Outlook_ as "Who Traced the RDX?" (29 July 2009). A long essay commissioned by _Hardnews_ is also reproduced here; an earlier version of "Terrorism's True Lies" was also published in _Hardnews_. These pieces have been revised and updated wherever necessary. I am thankful to the publishers and editors for publishing my articles and then graciously allowing me to draw upon them for use in this volume. Thanks to Shuddhabrata Sengupta, Sanjay Kapoor and Saba Naqvi for their support. The chapter on encounter killings was presented at a seminar at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library. I am thankful to colleagues at NMML for their comments. Asad Zaidi saw a book where I didn't. He was a most patient and indulgent publisher.

The generosity of many people has sustained this work.

I am beholden to the NMML for allowing me the time and freedom to undertake the travels necessary for this work.

I am grateful for the good counsel of Trideep Pais, Jawahar Raja, Mayur Suresh, Rajat Kumar, Sarim Naved, Ashwath Sitharaman, Salar Khan and Ashok Agrwaal. Special thanks are owed to Sushant Sinha of _Indiankanoon.org_ who can magically retrieve any untraceable judgement upon request; to Venkatesh Nayak, who is a wizard with RTIs, and to Subasri Krishnan for lending me her excellent film, _This or that Particular Person_. Rajeev Kumar prepared the tables on budget illustrating the comparative expenditure on defence.

My fellow travellers in this journey --- Mahtab and Mansi --- thank you for the comradeship. Friends who can be relied upon for warmth and cheer in times of despair: Poornima, Amit, Harsh, Satya, Sadiq, Mona, Inteshar, Imran, Mahmood, Anusha and Iqbal Ahmad.

Finally, my parents who put up with a negligent daughter, and Tanweer, for sharing my life, thank you.
