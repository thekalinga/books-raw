# CAUSES

## A Century Old Precedent

The December 1992 and the January 1993 riots came almost a century
after the Bombay riots of 1893. An account of the last century's riots is
to be found in the "Economic and Political Weekly" dated January
1993, pp. 182-187.

On that occasion also, rumours and incendiary writings had
excited passions on both sides. This followed from a pamphlet entitled
_The Dreadful Bombay Riots_ (_Mumbeima thaelum bhavankar
hoolad_) published for the _Cow-Protection Society_, which could well
compare with the outpourings of the _Saamna_ (the Shiv Sena
mouthpiece), the _Navakal_(a Marathi daily), not to speak of the
_Organiser_ (the mouthpiece of the RSS). Published on August 24 1893,
only 13 days after the first outbreak of the riots, the Gujarati pamphlet
contained verses "praising the actions of (Marathi) camatees and ghatis
for what they had done; the riots were not riots but brave fights
undertaken by Shivaji's warriors; the participants not rioters but
soldiers who had fought like men.

>Heroes! ye washed your bodies with blood
>
>and retreated not:
>
>Ye broke through files of rifles, Bravo,
>
>Valiant men, ye were not daunted, ye
>
>wearied the enemy out:
>
>Victory ye got forthwith, Bravo,
>
>Ye be relics of Peshwai, fortunate
>
>descendants of Shri Shivaji;
>
>Ye be no women, aye, ye are men, Bravo.
>
>God grant you success, night and day
>
>may He keep ye happy;
>
>Fight again in your country's good,
>
>Bravo.

Incidents had taken place all over the city then, as they had in
our present times. As in those days, there were numerous instances
when members of one religion protected members of the other. Also,
there is a surprising similarity between the slogans then uttered and
now popular. Says the writer of the article, Jim Masselos, "Much of the
rioting was done by coherent groups of men, attacking unsuspecting
passers-by, or else making forays into rival territory to attack property
or people or both. ... Essentially the forays drew upon the same kind of
territorial base as was displayed in various religious and other festivals,
insofar as the groups were often or usually reflections of
neighbourhoods and used them as bases from which to make their
sallies."

" ... the forays into rival territory merely highlight the distinction.
In some cases the forays became acts of conquest which gained
territory. Geographically, confrontations occurred in the forays into
rival territory, they also took place at points of intersection between
rival territories at the margins where the distinctions blurred. It was at
such points that individuals were often attacked, when walking along
main thoroughfares, in territories that were as much theirs as of the
opponent religion. Similarly individuals of a minority religion living in
a locality were attacked by groups from the majority religion but
originating outside their locality; minority members were often hidden
by locality co-dwellers, even though they were of the opposite
religion."

## Historical Background: A Survey

Even prior to the departure of the British from India, communal
polarisation has been used by individuals and groups as a means to
attain a following amongst the masses and through such a route,
attempt to gain power. The British policy of divide and rule enabled
such groups to legitimise their aspirations and actions. In course of
time, there arose political formations brazenly parading their parochial
platforms. The Hindu Mahasabha the Muslim League, the Akalis all
these and many more splinters made no secret of their striving for the
advancement of a section of the people to the exclusion of others.
Thus the Hindu communalists advocated the supremacy of the Hindu
faith, traditions and aspirations. The Muslim was seen as a polluting
element in the polity and his subjugation if not elimination was openly
advocated. In the same way the Muslim communalist spoke of a
mythical past when Islam and its adherents had brought glory to
various lands including India.

As to the Muslim leadership, now in its nascent stage, many of
them were fanatics. The Aga Khan, the Ali brothers, Jinnah in the
second phase of his political carrier and several others could not see a
future for themselves unless as leaders of a separatist group based on
religion.

Thus began a contest between the communalists of different
faiths and even within the same faith. Die-hard communal formations
like the RSS, the Khaksars, etc. were born. These developments, deftly
manoeuvred by the British, led to the birth of Pakistan. Despite the
migration of the regional Muslim leaders to Pakistan from India, those
remaining behind could not wholly forget the rewards of communal
consolidation. In the ex-provinces of Madras, Travancore, Cochin and
elsewhere the Muslim League came to be revived; the revival of the
party had only benefited a handful of politicians. Mullahs, Maulvis and
irrepressible hotheads managed to seize leadership of sections of the
Muslim community, not to speak of lesser notables who have
dominated various pockets of Muslims in different parts of the country.
As to the Hindus, but for the murder of Mahatma Gandhi, Hindu
militancy would have established itself firmly in the early 1950s.

Meanwhile, the continued Congress rule (or misrule), created an
impression in the minds of all opposition parties, that unless they
formed a united front, they could never dislodge the Congress from
power. This was buttressed by an allergy nursed by some against the
Nehru-Gandhi family.

The imposition of emergency and the excesses committed then,
became a sure platform to bring all sorts of parties, including
communalists together. Thus, the Leftists, Socialists, Imam Bukhari, RSS
and Jansangh, all spoke from the same platform. The Congress I was
defeated and the Janata Party formed the government. As always
happens, the disparate forces that had combined to defeat a common
enemy, soon disintegrated. The only beneficiary in this experiment
were the communalists who gained respect in national politics.

The protracted failure on the economic and political fronts,
created frustration and resentment amongst the masses. The Indian
State and the ruling elite have used two weapons to counteract this
crisis: on the ideological front, they have jettisoned Nehruvian
socialism and secularism . They are instead, seeking to promote
_Hindutva_, whether it be Indira Gandhi's soft variety or L.K.Advani's
more hardline approach. On the administrative front, the Indian State
has given prime importance to expanding and strengthening the
repressive State machinery.

Soon, the tentacles of the Sangh Parivar spread, invoking
Savarkar's idea of Hinduising politics and militarising the Hindus. In
this, Ayodhya became an easy symbol. The BJP, the Bajrang Dal, the
VHP and the Shiv Sena became the votaries of Ram as against Rahim;
the ultimate goal being not a Mandir or religion, but power at the
centre. The strategy was to create a permanent divide between the
Hindus and Muslims, the latter to be subjugated to the will of the
majority. The means was to instil terror and panic in the vast,
vulnerable section of the minority community. Unfortunately, both the
Janata and the Congress government at the Centre, prompted by their
own political compulsions, chose to play an ineffective role which
aided the pernicious designs of the Sangh Parivar. V.P.Singh had no
policy to check Advani's Rath Yatra. P.V.Narasimha Rao had no
programme to stop the demolition of the Babri Masjid. The communal
propaganda had gained an upper hand by this time and vitiated the
atmosphere in the country.

## The December Riots in Bombay

The Muslim reaction in Bombay to
the demolition of the mosque was violent
and vociferous but unchannelised and
unmeaningful. Mobs of youngsters, very
agitated in spirit, words and gestures came
out on the street to voice their anger at the
demolition of the mosque. Despite severe
provocation by the writings and speeches of the Hindu communalists,
the Muslims had maintained a dignified silence until 6.12.1992. The
ravings and rantings of the known communalists amongst the Muslims
like Imam Bukhari, Shahabuddin and the Babri Masjid Action
Committee did not have the support of the large majority of the
Muslims. Their attitude was to let the issue be decided by the Court
where cases were pending and thus get the issue out of the way. But
the brazen act of demolition left in the Muslim mind a sense of despair
coupled with humiliation. He now knew that the Indian state would
not come to his rescue, however legitimate his cause might be. He
further knew that the Hindu communalists would not stop at the
demolition of the Babri Masjid. The hotheads amongst the Hindu
community had already proclaimed their designs on the mosques at
Varanasi and Mathura. Some had even talked of a demolition of the
Jama Masjid at Delhi. The Sangh Parivar, well versed in double speak,
was doing or saying nothing to discourage the extremists. Bal
Thackery's speeches and the writings in _Saamna_ openly gloated over
the humiliation inflicted upon Muslims.

The Muslims in Bombay had no leader worth the name. There
was no one to guide them or even to instigate them. That explains the
sheer madness of the reaction amongst Muslims to the news of the
demolition of the mosque. They were at a loss to know how to
express themselves. What they did was typical of leaderless mobs;
they started pelting stones and other missiles at BEST buses and police
stations. Another favourite object of stoning were the offices of the
BMC which had incurred the displeasure of a large number of
struggling Muslims eking out a living by vending goods in
unauthorised structures. Beginning with the stoning of structures and
mobile objects, the mobs enlarged their sphere of targeting to include
policemen.

>The Muslims in
Bombay had no
leader worth the
name. There was no
one to guide them or
even to instigate
them.

At Shaukat Ali Road a Muslim mob attacked a police outpost
and burnt the motor bike of a policeman. The Muslim mob, incensed
by a policeman firing at them, were ready
to lynch the entire police party were it not
for the intervention of some wellmeaning
Muslims. This indiscriminate firing led to
the death of one Naseem Khan who was on
the second floor of Abbas Building. The
infuriated Muslim mob vented its anger by
damaging and looting three or four
linoleum shops owned by Hindus.

In Govandi the Dutt Mandir was set afire by the Muslims and the
temple was so badly affected that nothing but its shell remained.
Opposite the temple was a BEST colony in which Hindus lived. It was
their Muslim neighbours who had set fire to the Dutt Mandir and
stabbed two policemen who were posted there to guard the same.
The corpses of the policemen were dumped in a public toilet and a
garbage heap.

The Muslims of Dharavi insisted upon and obtained permission
to take out a retaliatory procession as against the one taken out by the
_Shiv Sainiks_ and the BJP to celebrate the demolition of the Babri
Masjid. In the _Hindutva_ procession some abusive slogans had been
uttered against the Muslims, one of them being that the proper place
for Muslims was either Pakistan or _kabrastan_. In the retaliatory
procession the Muslims uttered the provocative slogan that they would
not be cowed down and would avenge the insult to their religion. A
common slogan popular with the processionists is, "Jo hum se
takrayega, woh mitti mein mil jayega" (Those who oppose us will be
reduced to dust). This was an invitation to the Hindus to fight with the
Muslims. In the course of the _Hindutva_ procession, dung had been
flung at two Muslim mosques; not to be outdone the Muslim
procession stoned two Hindu temples. Hundreds of houses were
destroyed in Dharavi during the course of the riots. Eighty percent of
the victims were Muslims but ten to twenty percent of the victims were
Hindus.

But thereafter, the police literally took over the riots. The riots
had spread all over the city. The evidence recorded and summarised
herein, will show the large scale atrocities indulged in by the police
against Muslims, the majority of the dead and injured being Muslims.
Most of the victims had received bullet injuries in police firing. Quite a
number of them received bullet injuries in their own homes.

## The January Riots and the connection
between the two bouts of rioting

The January riots were an organised
crime, perpetrated by the communalists and
criminals in connivance with the police.

As the December riots subsided, the
Shiv Sena, the BJP and the anti-social
elements had realised that by and large, the
police were anti-Muslim. They had also
realised that at several places where Hindus and Muslims were residing
as neighbours, there was no ill will or tension between them. In fact,
in many _chawls_ and buildings, Hindus had given protection to Muslims
where the Muslims were in a minority and vice versa. This was not in
consonance with their purported goal of a permanent divide, with the
dominance of the majority over the minority.

Instead of joining in the efforts of certain forces to eliminate
communal tension, these elements sought to build up tension in a
systematic manner.

An attempt to rebuild a damaged temple by the Muslims at
Bandra was spurned by their leader Madhukar Sarpotdar on the
grounds that the day and hour for installation of a new idol had not
arrived! The damaged temple was used as an exhibit by Madhukar
Sarpotdar and his followers in the Khar - Bandra area to generate new
tension whilst keeping alive the old ones. The so called banned
organisation of the Sangh Parivar turned their energies towards the
fashioning of a new instrument to create communal tension. This was
the _maha-arti_. Huge placards and blackboards proclaiming the staging
of _maha-artis_ were put up in different localities. The Hindus were
invited to turn up for the ceremony in large numbers and join in an
endeavour to put an end to the appeasement policies of the
government which permitted Muslims to blare their azaan (call to
prayer) five times a day through loud-speakers and also the use of
public roads for offering of Friday afternoon prayers. The thoughtless
Muslims refused to give up the practice under such pressure and this
provided the _Hindutva_ forces with a golden opportunity to deepen the
suspicion between the communities already affected by the
happenings of 6.12.1992 and the period thereafter.

>_Maha-artis_
were deliberately
organised by the _Shiv
Sainiks_ and the BJP at
this crucial period,
only to build up
tension.

_Maha-arti_ was not a known religious practice of Hindus. In any
event, it was never in vogue in Bombay. It was deliberately organised
by the _Shiv Sainiks_ and the BJP at this crucial period, only to build up
tension. It is on record that after most _maha-artis_, there were
incidents of attacks and abuse on Muslims.
We cannot appreciate how the police and
the government could have permitted such
programmes, if they had any genuine
regard for peace in this city. Between
26.12.1992 and 5.1.1993, there were 33 such
_maha-artis_ in various parts of the city.
When Bal Thackeray wrote in the 9.1.1993
issue of the _Saamna_, that, "... The next few
days will be ours...", it was clear that the planning had commenced
much earlier.

On Saturday, 2.1.1993 and Sunday, 3.1.1993, certain persons
claiming to be officials from the Housing Board went about Pratiksha
Nagar to identify the minority community houses. Outside every such
tenement a mark was put, which enabled the attackers, later on, to loot
and destroy the minority owned tenements. This exercise was
repeated at Malwani. At other places spot-lights were fixed to focus on
Muslim houses. By the time the riot began on 6.1.1993, the Shiv Sena
and BJP had the entire list and particulars of Muslim houses, shops,
taxis etc., which were later systematically attacked by the rioters.

The opportunity to launch such a major attack came to them, on
account of two or three incidents. Two mathadi workers at Masjid
Bunder were murdered on or about 5.1.1993. It is not clear who
committed the offense. There was a report that this could have been
due to inter-union rivalry. Another report was that it was not a
communal killing but the result of personal enmity.

The other incident relates to the Jogeshwari killings, in a room
in the Gandhi _Chawls_ on 8.1.1993. There have been conflifting reports
about this incident and no conclusive finding, can therefore be arrived
at. It has also been claimed by the government and _Hindutva_ forces
that a large number of persons were stabbed to death around the J.J.
Hospital area between 6.1.1993 an 8.1.1993. In Mahim it was
rumoured that the Muslim Durgah was demolished by the Hindus.
These incidents or rumours and a few others were sufficient reason for
the Shiv Sena, the BJP and their associates to indulge in large scale
rioting all over the city.

The Shiv Sena admitted that they were involved in the riots. Bal
Thackeray said, "I want to teach Muslims a lesson"(Time Magazine,
25.1.1993). Mr. Manohar Joshi said, "I will not call them _Shiv Sainiks_.
They were all anguished Hindus who were spontaneously reacting to
what happened in Jogeshwari". Not mentioned is that _maha-artis_ took
place in Jogeshwari as early as 1.1.1993. On 6.1.1993 a bakery next to
the police station and some Muslim huts in
Chachanagar were burnt. On 7.1.1993 a
_maha-arti_ was held in Shankarwadi,
followed by stone throwing and the
burning of a Muslim house in Pathan
Chawl. The atmosphere of hatred and illwill
had been deliberately built up.

>The Shiv Sena
>admitted that they
>were involved in the
>riots. Bal Thackeray
>said, "I want to teach
>Muslims a lesson"
>
>--- Time Magazine

This demonstrates the meticulousness
with which this crime against society was
planned. The method employed had a two-fold objective. Firstly, to
mobilise a large number of middle-class, passive Hindus to participate
in the riots; this was done by spreading rumours of armed Muslims
from Dubai coming from the sea to attack Hindus or 500 Muslims
armed with AK 47spreparing to attack. Secondly, to create fear
amongst Muslims who were residing in Hindu dominated areas. The
fear would make them temporarily leave their homes, making it safe
for the rioters to loot, destroy and burn their homes. Very few Hindu
neighbours had the courage to repel such attacks.

The police did very little to prevent the riots. The government
was totally ineffective. Bal Thackeray openly claimed that the mobs
were under his control. It was he who finally said that, "A lesson had
been taught" and that the _Shiv Sainiks_ should now desist from
indulging in violence.

Thus the connection between the two bouts of rioting was the
deliberate cultivation of a mindset amongst the Hindus which made
them entertain the belief that the Muslims, not content with having
insisted upon the location of Babri Masjid or Ram Janmabhoomi, had
done the unspeakable by daring to protest against its demolition.
Further, the only way the Hindu psyche could be assuaged would be
by a bloodbath and razed homes and properties of Muslims. The
excesses of the Muslims in some areas in the December 1992 bout of
rioting gave the Hindu communalists the very opportunity they had
been seeking all these years.

## The Role of the Police

Witness after witness has stated before us that the police were
not at all helpful to them. Very often the police remained bystanders.
More often than not they were openly on the side of the Hindu
aggressors.

>Police officers
and constables openly
said that they were
_Shiv Sainiks_ at heart
and policemen of a
supposedly secular
State by accident.

Complaints of police excesses were not inquired into on the
grounds that this would demoralise the police force. In fact, the
minister of state for Home, Babanrao
Pachpute, the directorgeneral of police,
Ramamurthi and the commissioner of police
of Bombay, Bapat, came out with
statements commending the policefor their
timely action, but for which, so they said,
the havoc would have been much more.
This lauding of the police was a major
reason for the police openly vilifying
Muslims and refusing to come to their assistance when they were
targeted during the January 1993 riots. Time and again policemen and
officers taunted Muslims about the concessions they had allegedly
enjoyed in the past, their having been pampered beyond tolerance,
their getting away with all sorts of things and so on and so forth. Even
those requesting for a glass of water at police stations where they had
been driven to take refuge were told that they had received enough
and should go to Pakistan if they wanted more. Police officers and
constables openly said that they were _Shiv Sainiks_ at heart and
policemen of a supposedly secular State by accident.

Journalists, social activists, social workers and eye-witnesses
have stated before us that the police were responsible for the death of
a large number of innocent people. Women, children, old men, all of
whom were unarmed, have been shot at close range,most of them
within their homes. Many of them appealed to the police against
indiscriminate firing but they themselves were killed. Many who
received bullet injuries were not involved in the rioting. The doctors
(Dr. Murlidhar and Dr. Nagral) who gave evidence before us have
stated that 75% of the people who had come for treatment to hospitals
(KEM and Sion Hospital) were victims of bullet injuries. Most of the
injuries were fatal or near fatal because the bullets were lodged in the
abdomen, chest or skull.

Ms. Suma Josson who has produced a video film entitled
"Bombay's Blood Yatra" covering the two bouts of riots, has recorded
the statement of the Greater Bombay police DCP Bhiwandi (where
there was no rioting), "When there is a morcha or riot, some people
become violent. Then we resort to lathi charge to control them. If this
fails to control the mob, we employ tear gas to disperse them. When
even that measure fails, we have to make use of fire power. And firing
should always be under the waist line, because our aim is not to kill
them. Our aim is to disperse the violent mob." In Bombay these
requisite guidelines were not observed, on a specious plea that
communal riots cannot be controlled except
with a strong enough deterrent --- loss of
human life. (Indian Express, 24.12.1992).

>There is
no provision in the
Constitution or in any
law, that the police
can choose to kill in a
communal riot.

This is an untenable stand on the
part of the police. The police have no right
to kill. There is no provision in the
Constitution or in any law, that the police
can choose to kill in a communal riot. The
police have only a right to defend and use
such power as may be necessary to avoid an injury to them. The
suspension of Article 21 is not envisaged by the Constitution during
the period of a riot or a communal riot. After the 44th Amendment,
Article 21 does not stand suspended even during the period of
proclamation of emergency. In the present case, many of the killings
took place, not when the deceased were in the mob, but within their
own homes. In our view, in law, all these police personnel who have
indulged in such firing are liable for prosecution for causing injuries
and death under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code. Prima facie
all injured persons and the kith and kin of those who died in police
firing, are entitled to have the police prosecuted for these offenses
under the Indian Penal Code. It is for the police to defend their action
as provided under the law.

Apart from this brutality, the police are also guilty of being
partisan in these riots. Many witnesses have stated before us that they
were attacked in the presence of the police and the police did nothing.
In many cases, the police openly supported the rioters and
accompanied them in the attack. When the victims went to the police
station they were driven away without recording their complaints. In
some cases, the FIRs have been recorded but no further investigation
has been undertaken. Several houses and shops were looted and the
police could have prevented this or, in any case, have made efforts to
recover the looted articles.

What is regrettable is that in their frenzy to support a particular
community, as against the other, the police had become indifferent to
human misery. In particular, we would like to mention the cases of
molestation of women and of rape and gang-rape. S. H_____ of
Kandivili had her case reluctantly taken up by the police at the
instance of SWADHAR. The police made no genuine attempt to
investigate. Still worse is the case of Ms. F.S_____ from Sewri, where the
police were themselves involved in gang-rape. The victim now has no
faith in the police and in the administration of justice.

>The police
and the government
gave permission to
the Shiv Sena and the
BJP to perform
_maha-artis_.

In our view, whenever an ethnic or a
communal riot takes place, the police have
to be absolutely impartial. But if the police
themselves support one group as against
the other there will be no law and order
left. This is exactly what happened in most
areas of the city. It is in this sense, that the
police themselves are responsible for the
breakdown of law and order during the
riots, particularly in January.

This was evident from their behaviour. After the first bout of
riots in December, the police ought to have seen that the riots did not
erupt again. The police and the government should have taken care to
see that no tension was allowed to be built up. Instead, the police and
the government gave permission to the Shiv Sena and the BJP to
perform _maha-artis_. The evidence clearly indicates that _maha-artis_
were one of the main causes for building up of tension leading to a
riot, as happened in January 1993. In our view, permitting such mahaartis
in different parts of the city during the said interregnum and
thereafter, was a gross dereliction of duty on the part of the police.
Whoever had taken the decision to grant such permission should be
answerable to the people of Bombay.

Since we found that many witnesses have mentioned the names
of police officers and other personnel attached to different police
stations as persons who have indulged in various acts of atrocities, illtreatment,
collusion, connivance and inaction, we thought that we
could obtain clarification from the police. Accordingly by our letter
dated 3.6.1993, addressed to the commissioner of police, we annexed a
list of police officers against whom allegations have been made and
requested the commissioner to give us a suitable reply or explanation.
There has been no reply from the commissioner of police to date.
Though we are now free to draw an adverse inference, we do not
propose to do so. But we can certainly assume that there is
considerable truth in what the victims of acts of commission and
omission by the police have stated before us.

Hence, we propose to name these police officers who are prima
facie guilty of such acts of commission or omission as are alleged
against them by the witnesses. They are all liable for prosecution as
mentioned above. The names are as mentioned in the annexure
marked "Annexure III". We do not want to create an impression that
these are the only guilty officers. There could be several others whose
names may not have been mentioned
before us.

>Many of the victims
were nervous to
reveal the names of
the police and the
rioters who had
attacked them as they
feared retaliation.

We may mention that many of the
victims were nervous to reveal the names of
the police and the rioters who had attacked
them as they feared retaliation from these
persons and their henchmen. Some gave
out the names on our assurance that the
witnesses names would not be divulged. In
the case of some of the officers, written complaints to the chief
minister have already been filed, but with no response.

## Rumours and Bigotry as instruments to provoke riots

Rumours triggered off a number of incidents during the recent
Bombay riots. The false rumour of 9.12.92 about the arrest of Bal
Thackeray was so well orchestrated as to provoke riots on a fairly large
scale. No serious effort was made by the police to counter this
rumour. The rumour that the firemen's colony had been reduced to
ashes by Muslim mobs led to two Muslim women being burnt in their
home and the destruction of a bakery. The Hindu rioters later admitted
to having perpetrated this act on account of the rumour in respect of
firemen's colony. The Suleman Bakery on Mohammed Ali Road was
targeted by the police for no better reason than an unconfirmed
rumour that the said bakery had been used to fire at a police posse
posted in the vicinity. A number of persons working in the Bakery
were shot at, some of whom died. One worker who had the
misfortune to be fair complexioned and therefore assumed to be a
Kashmiri was shot dead in cold blood by the police right under the
nose of the joint commissioner of police, Mr. Tyagi and with journalists
in the vicinity.

In Tulsiwadi the _Kathiawadi-Dalits_ were aroused to fury against
their Muslim neighbours on the basis of a rumour about the raping of
three Kathiawadi-Dalit women. The rapes had allegedly taken place
in Bhendi Bazaar and the criminals were said to be Muslims. Passions
ran high because the women happened to be the wife and two sisters
of the notorious Prince Babaria, an influential figure amongst the
_Kathiawadi-Dalits_.

>Rumour-mongering
>helps Fascists to
>magnify the minority
>into a dangerous
>monster...
>
>--- Anand Patwardhan

Certain papers gave credence to the theory about the arrival of
consignments of arms and ammunition to Bombay from foreign
countries, meaning thereby from Pakistan or the Middle-East. In fact
one of the police officers when asked by Muslims for assistance to
check armed vans of _Shiv Sainiks_,
countered by saying that this was the time
for the Muslims to bring out the arms they
had received from Pakistan. One of the
journalists stated that even middle-class
Maharashtrian Hindus had become so
surcharged by the rumours circulated that
they were bound to do something
destructive. Anand Patwardhan, film maker,
was told by his Hindu friends residing at Cadell Road that they had
been keeping vigil at night because of an expected attack by Muslims
from Dubai launching an offensive from the sea. A similar rumour was
set afloat at Dadar (East); one day the rumour was that the Muslims
had poisoned the milk supply to Bombay city, the next day the rumour
was that the bread being sold in the city had been poisoned in Muslim
bakeries. According to Mr. Patwardhan, "this sort of rumour-mongering
is a classic Fascist technique used by them whenever they get the
occasion. Indulgence in this method helps the Fascist to magnify a
hapless minority into a dangerous monster against whom self-defense
is necessary. Very soon the urge for self-defense gets formulated into
an attack on the minority."

A fabricated message of the Imam of Jama Masjid, Delhi was set
in motion by the _Hindutva_ forces. The message was written in the
Devnagri script and called upon Muslims to wage _jehaad_ against the
idolators as they were _kafirs_. That the Imam would not use Hindi to
communicate with his followers did not worry the Hindu leaders. Past
masters at fabrication of incendiary news and insinuations, they have
been having a free hand in concocting and circulating inflammatory
rumours. This has been going on year after year without any check by
the authorities supposed to be in charge of law and order.

## The Role of Criminals and Anti-Social Elements

Every large-scale riot is an open invitation for the criminals and
anti-social elements to join in and share the booty. The Bombay riots
were no exception; it was a combination of criminals, communalists
and the partisan police who were in the forefront of all the looting,
killing and destruction. It is a well known fact that several _Shiv Sainiks_
had criminal records, to name a few - late Khim Bahadur Thapa, late
Vithal Chavan, Jaywant Parab, Chandrakant Padwal, Baburao Mane,
Anand Dighe and Madhukar Sarpotdar, all of whom have criminal
records. When Madhukar Sarpotdar was apprehended by the army,
there were seven accomplices with him,
carrying three revolvers, seven live
cartridges, choppers, hockey sticks and
stumps. One of the accomplices was
named Anil Parab, who is said to be a hitman
of the dreaded Dawood Ibrahim.

It is said that the Shiv Sena has about
220 _Shakhas_ in Bombay, each Shakha
having about 200 committed members.
Even on normal days the _Shiv Sainiks_ behave as if they are a law unto
themselves. During the riots almost all of these persons were active
participants

>Sarpotdar was
apprehended by the
army, with seven
accomplices carrying
revolvers, live
cartridges, choppers,
hockey sticks...

Such criminal elements have also entered other parties such as
the Congress. Witnesses from certain areas said that known criminals
associated with the Congress were seen to be taking part in the riots.

Many victims dared not mention the names of their assailants to
the police, as they were not sure of protection from the police. In
certain cases where victims returned to their erstwhile locality, they
were told that they would be allowed to stay on condition that they
did not pursue their complaints. At Charkop, Kandivili, 390 persons
had been arrested by a particular police officer who was subsequently
transferred. The victims were told that they would be allowed to live
in peace, provided they did not identify any of those arrested.

However, when the witnesses appeared before us, quite a
number of them were brave enough to mention the names of the
rioters. We have compiled the names areawise and the same is
annexed hereto and marked "Annexure IV". The list is not exhaustive
as many witnesses have not given names. Most of these assailants are
still moving about freely in the locality and threatening several
innocent and helpless victims.

## The Role of the Politicians and the Political Parties

In the past the Congress boss of Bombay S.K. Patil had
encouraged the formation of a rabidly anti-social Indian grouping
which called itself the Shiv Sena. Pandering to the Marathi-speaking
population, it generated a lot of animosity against the hard-working
South Indian migrants who had come to Bombay in search of a living,
In course of time flogging South Indians went out of fashion and the
Shiv Sena _Pramukh_ Bal Thackeray latched on to the latent prejudice
against Muslims. The path for playing on this prejudice had been
cleared by the different units of the Sangh Parivar. They filched some
pages from the history of the state and with
suitable distortions tried to transform
Shivaji, who was a progressive king for his
time, into a bigoted Hindu bent on
eradication of Muslim rule as also Muslims.
This was a blatant falsehood. Far from
being an enemy of Muslims or Islam, Shivaji
had several Muslims in his army and navy,
some of whom occupied positions of trust
and honour. As to Islam as a faith, Shivaji was a true embodiment of a
believer in the concept of "Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava". A lie repeated
often and with due solemnity becomes in course of time the creed
according to the Gospel. Bal Thackeray adjusted himself quite well to
the path cleared for him by the Sangh Parivar. Finance did not seem
to be a problem for him and a number of industrialists frightened by
the militant trade unions, were supporting him. The Congress
ministers ruling Maharashtra, finding the leftist trade unions difficult to
handle, joined hands with Bal Thackeray to weaken the working-class
by creating rifts of different kinds amongst them. Gradually the Shiv
Sena came to acquire a stranglehold over the city of Bombay.

For the first time it seized the reins of power in the BMC in
1985. This was a gift to the party by the then chief minister, Vasant
      Dada Patil's calculated indiscretion about the Centre having designs to
      separate the city of Bombay from the rest of Maharashtra. This lie was
      given wide prominence by the Marathi press and the Marathi-speaking
      supporters of the Shiv Sena turned out in full strength to vote for the
      Shiv Sena thereby insuring their victory. The BMC is the richest local
      body in the country. It awards contracts and works running into
      crores of rupees. All manner of characters bid for these lucrative
      contracts. Politicians in different committees of the Corporation are
      vested with immense power in the award of contracts. Malpractices in
      the tendering of and scrutiny of contracts is well known. The
      successful ones have to give their political masters the promised cuts.
      A sizable portion of the money thus earned went into the beefing up
      of _Shakhas_ of the Shiv Sena not only in the metropolis but also
      different parts of the state and even other states like Gujarat,
      Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Soon, the
      _Shakhas_ became powerful centres in each ward for getting things done
      by threats and muscle power. Protection rackets had always existed in
      Bombay and the Shakha leaders absorbed the racketeers. The takings
      went into their own upkeep and also to the central treasury. From
      time to time the Shiv Sena staged
      spectacular shows on occasions like
      Dassera, Shiv Jayanti, Ganpati festival and
      Navratri. These festivals gave a further
      chance for extraction of donations. The
      common folk were not averse to taking
      their problems like obtaining a water tap or
      privies in their areas to their _Shakhas_.
      Public land was encroached upon and the
      _Shakha Pramukh_ often turned slumlord.

>The propaganda
couched in _Hindutva_
terms continued
unabated, despite
court verdicts.

The followers of the Sangh Parivar were not averse to the
growth of the Shiv Sena, for in one sense, the latter provided it with
the cannon fodder required to fight battles with the leftists, the
secularists, the Muslims and the administration. The inability to forge
an alliance in later elections resulted in depletion of their strength. But
the propaganda couched in _Hindutva_ terms continued unabated,
despite court verdicts against such propaganda.

The loss of control over the BMC and the incapacity of the party
to capture power in the state led to a sharp reduction in the finances it
could muster. With the fall from power, the protection racket also
became more fragile. But those who remained were on the lookout
for an opportunity and this opportunity they got in the aftermath of the
demolition of the Mosque. The evidence shows that in and after
January 1993, the Shiv Sena launched a concerted drive to extort
protection meney from the Muslims, on a massive scale.

There has been an open admission by the the Shiv Sena that
they were actively involved in the riots. But L.K.Advani, the BJP leader
who came to Bombay to survey the loss, concentrated only on the
Gandhi Chawl and refused to believe that the Shiv Sena was
responsible for initiating or participating in the riots. The BJP went to
the extent of saying that the rioting was the work of mobs and not of
political workers. We have on the other hand, collected voluminous
evidence to show that even BJP workers were involved in several
incidents of rioting.

For that matter, even some of the Congress and RPI workers
were involved in the riots. But more important is the fact that the state
administration failed. At the ministerial level, Bombay city was left to
be handled by the novice Babanrao Pachpute. Sudhakarrao Naik
delayed his return from Nagpur where he had gone to attend the
legislative session. Even after his return to Bombay, he chose to be
secluded in his official residence instead of in the field directing
operations. When he did come out it was
in a motor cavalcade which added to the
irony of politicians not giving up their perks
and splendour even in the midst of a
Bombay in flames.

>The Congress
politicians utilised the
_Shiv Sainik_ units to
score ephemeral
victories against their
factional rivals.

Politically, the Congress politicians
were more interested in their factional
quarrels. All of them utilised the _Shiv
Sainik_ units at some point or the other to
score ephemeral victories against their factional rivals. Opponents of
Vasant Dada Patil had Rajeev Gandhi remove him from chief
ministership and one of the grounds trotted out was his proximity to
the Sena politicians. Vasant Dada Patil was of course in cahoots with
the Shiv Sena, but then he was following the hoary traditions of his
predecessors right from the times of Vasantrao Naik down to Sharad
Pawar when he was leading the PDF government, not excluding
A.R.Antulay. Even so, Vasant Dada Patil was ousted and S.B. Chavan
installed in his place. S.B. Chavan's ministry was unparalleled in its
ineptitude and unpopularity. The Shiv Sena was fast gaining ground
and Sharad Pawar was brought to the helm to put the state in order.
But in true Congress tradition, even before Sharad Pawar had got a
grip on the administration, his rivals began sniping at him; to
Congressmen their enemies in the organisation are far more repulsive
than those in the opposition parties.

During the riots, it was common knowledge that the
continuance of the riots was due to the rift between Mr. Sharad Pawar
and Mr. Sudhakarrao Naik. At one stage, Mr. Naik even threatened to
expose the various lobbies and the underworld connections in high
places that had provoked the violence in Bombay, for he had dared to
take them on. _The Times of India_ dated 15.1.1993 wrote, "If what
Mr. Naik says is even partly true, then it is of the utmost importance
that he should be asked to divulge forthwith the details of this
diabolical act of vengeance against him. The citizens of Bombay and
indeed the people of India had every right to know who is behind the
terrible happenings in the metropolis and the reasons that impelled
them to act in the way they did. This, in turn, will facilitate the task of
bringing to book the culprits for over 500 deaths, for the devastation
suffered by the families of the victims and for mass migrations from the
city, not to speak of the climate of intimidation and fear which has
shattered the spirit of cosmopolitanism in Bombay." But Mr. Naik did
not oblige thereafter.

When the Prime Minister visited the
city, he absolved Mr. Naik of responsibility
for failing to prevent the riots. Though he
had not had enough time to console the
victims, he had a leisurely meeting with
of responsibility Shiv Sena leaders including Madhukar
Sarpotdar who was later detained under
the National Securities Act.

>When the
Prime Minister

The local politicians including the
so called representatives of the Muslims in the legislature and
elsewhere did a disappearing act. Several witnesses testified to
having rung up ministers, MPs, MLAs and corporators only to find
that they were not at home or unable to come to the rescue of the
victims. There were exceptions like Sunil Dutt who worked day and
night to douse the fires of hatred or save helpless people. As to the
legislators, corporators and MPs of the _Hindutva_ variety, they went
about spouting venom when in the midst of their followers and
making sweet talk and sounding reasonable when faced with other
audiences. Muslims who believed their contacts with the
communalist leaders amongst the Hindus would aid them in their
hour of agony, were soon disillusioned. An example of this was the
editor of the "Urdu Blitz" who was caught up in the midst of a
rampaging mob and contacted his councillor friend from the Shiv
Sena. The councillor kept on repeating assurances that no harm
would come-to the Editor. Yet, the very building in which the
councillor lived was used for targeting Muslim homes including that
of the Muslim editor, all of whom lived opposite the building
occupied by the arsonists.

## The Role of the Press

By and large, the English press came out with a fairly true
account of the events. Many journalists who have clearly done
commendable work have deposed before us. _The Times of India_
reporters, Naresh Fernandes and Clarence Fernandez covered several
areas and reported the happenings accurately. The statements given
by the witnesses in respect of several incidents before us almost
tallies with the versions of the reports as they appeared in the said
daily. The Bombay Union of Journalists (BUJ) had formed a
committee to probe into the cause of the riots. Jatin Desai of the
"Janmabhoomi", a Gujarati daily refers to an incident which
happened at Behram Baug. The police had entered the bathroom of
a certain house and shot dead four
persons. This news item appeared in "The
Daily" and "Gujarat Samachar", the next
day. The committee members of the BUJ
then met the concerned police inspector
Kamlakar (Oshiwara), who admitted that
he had given the instructions for the
police to resort to firing because the
Muslims had tried to attack the nearby
Shankar Temple. Mr. Jatin Desai says that when they inquired
further they found that there was no Shankar Temple there, but only
a Ganesh Temple which was intact.

>Much before the riots,
the communal press
had already
orchestrated a
campaign of lies and
half-truths.

Mr. Asghar Ali Engineer has pointed out that those Hindi,
Marathi and Urdu papers who wrote against the BJP - Shiv Sena,
faced the wrath of the _Shiv Sainiks_. Urdu journalist Haroon Rashid
escaped just in time before his house was looted.

The Marathi press, barring a few exceptions and some
eveningers gave credence to several rumours, which appeared with
bold print, perhaps to boost their sales, but with consequential
damage to the general atmosphere of prevailing tension.

Much before the riots, the communal press had already
orchestrated a campaign of lies and half-truths. The communal bias
of the police force, exhibited during the riots, becomes easier to
understand when one sees that the favourite reading material is the
_Saamna_, _Navakal_ or "Tarun Bharat". Most of the Marathi papers,
barring some honourable exceptions pander to the _Hindutva_
* sentiments in different ways. They give an excessive and alarmist tilt
  to the doings of the Muslim communalists and Muslim politicians.

Bal Thackeray's venomous speeches against Muslims which he
made no effort to camouflage were widely publicised. In the English
press also, the spread of _Hindutva_ elements has been on the increase.
Gurumurthi, Arun Shourie and Prabhu Chawla made no secret of their
links with the Sangh Parivar. Girilal Jain speaks of the Babri Masjid as
the turning point in the history of the humiliated Hindus. M.V. Kamath
must have written umpteen articles justifying the RSS-BJP creed as a
natural reaction to the Hindus not attaining their aim of an "Akhand
Bharat". Letters to the editor containing all manner of insinuations and
allegations against Muslims are a prominent feature of several
newspapers. Mr.Dileep Padgaonkar, editor of _The Times of India_ and
his team have brought out an anthology of reports on the riots and
bomb blasts, together with comments and leading articles, under the
title "When Bombay Burned".

>It is not possible to
believe that Pakistani
and Bangladeshi
agents instigated the
riots where the major
sufferers were
Indian Muslims.

## The Foreign Hand

We have found no evidence of a
foreign hand or even the presence of any
Pakistani or Bangladesh infiltrators
initiating or participating in the riots. Leena
Joshi, director of Apnalaya, a charitable
institution functioning at Govandi who has
close contacts with the residents of that area says that the proportions
of Bangladeshis is hardly five in two thousand. There are no
Pakistanis in that area. So also in other areas. In the vernacular press
it was reported that Behrampada was a den of criminals, anti-nationals
and illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and Pakistan and that there is
a factory which produces arms. Ms. Flavia Agnes has made a detailed
report on Behrampada which shows that there is no truth in these
allegations. Pakistan might have been meddling in the internal affairs
of India. Its role in fomenting militancy in Punjab and Jammu and
Kashmir is too well known to need any comment. Clear as this may
be, it is not possible to believe the theory that Pakistani and
Bangladeshi agents and infiltrators instigated and/or participated in a
riot in which the major sufferers were Indian Muslims residing in
Bombay and whose aggressors were the followers of the _Hindutva_
organisations. Credulity has its limits and the incredible cannot be
accepted in the face of the damning evidence to the contrary.

## Builders and Slumlords

We have no evidence of any known builder taking part in or
instigating any incident during the riots. According to Asghar Ali
Engineer, only at Malad was a local builder involved in the December
riots. One other witness from Byculla implicates a local builder. But,
it cannot be said that the builder's lobby was involved in these riots.
Ms. Hazel D'Lima, Principal of Nirmala Niketan College of Social Work
had sent a team of teachers and students to several areas during the
period 12.12.1992 to 23.12.1992. She has also prepared a report on the
basis of their survey. She says that they did not come across any
evidence that builders or slumlords had a hand in the commencement,
continuation or assistance of the riots. However, we must say that
certain witnesses have referred to their assailants as local slumlords.

We must refer to the repeated attacks on Behrampada on a
different footing. Significantly, there was no riot inter se amongst the
residents of Behrampada. In spite of brutal attacks on Muslim
residents by the police and outsiders, no
Hindu resident was attacked. Equally
significant is the fact that no one fled from
Behrampada. Ms. Flavia Agnes has made a
detailed report on Behrampada and has this
observation to make, "The issue of
Behrampada is not around a religious
identity. The fight seems to be between a
lower class _basti_ which is on the verge of
being wiped out on the pretext of ensuring middle-class safety and the
Shiv Sena who wants to take the credit for achieving this laudable task
and secure its own position. Once the _basti_ is shifted, the land prices
in the area will soar and the middle-class will gain. It cannot be too
far-fetched to infer that Babri Masjid demolitions and the ensuing
tensions in the city provided the right environment in which a
campaign against the Muslim _basti_ could be fanned with a vengeance."

>The issue of
>Behrampadais not
>around a religious
>identity.
>
>--- Flavia Agnes

Behrampada was a stinking marshland four decades ago. But
gradually the landless and lower middle-class people who were mostly
Muslims, settled in this area. The marshy land became solid ground,
The temporary mud houses came to be converted into pucca
structures. Several Muslim artisans came and started their traditional
crafts of block-printing, zari and embroidery work, ready-made
garments, costume jewellery and carpentry. During this period the
surrounding areas have developed economically. The only eyesore
was this _basti_. Whilst it was not possible to clear the _basti_ lawfully, the
riot became a convenient excuse to raze the _basti_ through _goondagiri_
with the backing of the police, the middle-class residents, the parochial
trade unions and the press. Fortunately, the _basti_ survived. We are
inclined to agree with Ms. Flavia Agnes' conclusions.
