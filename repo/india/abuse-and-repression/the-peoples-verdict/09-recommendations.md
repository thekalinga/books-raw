# RECOMMENDATIONS

## SHORT TERM

### (a) People's Committees

As the riots spread in Bombay, the police were, by and large,
reluctant to prevent the same. In fact, as we have seen above, the
police were in league with the rioters in several places. Similarly the
politicians were mostly bystanders; they did very little to prevent the
riots.

We have noticed that certain areas have experienced riots in
December 1992 and yet witnessed no incidents of riots in January 1993
and vice versa. Govandi was worst hit in December 1992 but was
mostly peaceful in January 1993. Pratiksha Nagar was the opposite,
with no riots in December 1992 and witnessing the worst havoc in
January 1993.

We have also noticed that, in certain
pockets no riots took place whilst the
surrounding areas were severely affected by
riots. For example, though Dharavi was
one big slum, the riots were not all over the
place. Mahatma Gandhi Nagar in Dharavi is
one pocket where nothing happened in
spite of a mixed population with Muslims
being fewer in number. Similarly, in
Andheri (East), there were no incidents in areas like Trimbak Estate, a
group of _chawls_. It is equally interesting to note that in certain riot
prone areas of the past there were no incidents this time round.
Bhiwandi, outside Bombay, and Kamathipura in Bombay, (where there
were communal riots in 1984 and 1987) in Bombay were peaceful this
time. In this connection we commend the work done by the Bharatiya
Janwadi Aghadi in bringing out the booklet entitled "The Bombay
which the Fascists could not Burn", which shows how in several areas
the riots did not take place because of the people's peace-keeping
efforts.

>In several areas
the riots did not take
place because of the
people's peace-keeping efforts.

What happened was that in several areas the people themselves
organised defence committees and undertook the responsibility of
preventing the riots. Even when there were rumours of assault on one
community by the other, the defence committee prevailed upon the
people to maintain peace. The committee members patrolled the area
under their protection. In Mahatma Gandhi Nagar, Dharavi when the
youth and men of the defence committee were rounded up by the
police and taken to the police station, the women of the area then
took a morcha to the police station and pleaded that without their
menfolk, the lives of women and children were in jeopardy. This
worked, and the defence committee continued its work. In most of
these defence committees no politician was involved. Later on, in
January 1993 even the residents of buildings at Cuffe Parade, Napean
Sea Road, Bhulabhai Desai Road, Carmichael Road, etc. organised
committees to safeguard their buildings against intrusion from
outsiders.

Now that the riots are over, this mechanism can be conveniently
used to prevent the recurrence of such communal riots in future. Such
committees can as well be termed "People's Committees". We are of
the view that such People's Committees should be organised in every
ward in the city of Bombay. The committee should have a fair
representation of members from each community. No active member
or an office bearer of any political party
should be included in such committees.
Similarly,no person with a criminal history
should be allowed to join. By and large the
people themselves should be encouraged to
constitute such committees. However if for
any reason, such committees are not
organised in any ward, the local inspector-in-charge of the police station should be
directed to constitute such committees within the wards which fall
under the jurisdiction of his police station.

>We are
of the view
that such People's
Committees should be
organised in every
ward in the city of
Bombay.

Whenever there is any tense situation which may lead to
communal riots, the People's Committee should take the initiative in
preventing the same. Generally the police should be directed to act in
aid of the People's Committee. The committee should meet at regular
intervals and the inspector-in-charge should attend such meetings so as
to ascertain the events and activities that go on within the area.

If in spite of the People's Committee's warning and its efforts
communal riots do break out in any ward, the police must be held
responsible for the same. In our opinion, if the police had not
connived with the communal parties and anti-social elements, the riots
could have been prevented in many areas. In any case, the January
1993 riots could have been wholly avoided. Therefore, when the
People's Committees are constituted to sense the pulse of the people
and to invoke a feeling of confidence in their pursuit of peaceful coexistence,
the police cannot shirk its responsibility in the maintenance
of law and order. In this sense people's power and police power must
complement each other.

### (b) Urgent Steps for Restoration of Normalcy

(i) The police must take effective steps to prosecute all the
rioters without any reservation. It is our experience that many
witnesses who have deposed before us and given the names of their
assailants, are afraid to go to the police station to lodge or pursue their
complaints. The victims have no confidence in the police. Many
witnesses have stated that their assailants are still freely moving about
in the locality, threatening the victims who dare not proceed further
with their complaints. Witnesses have also stated that in many cases
the police themselves have told the victims that they would be given
protection and allowed to live in peace, on the condition that they do
not insist on cases being filed against certain assailants. In our
opinion, this situation will ultimately lead to
revenge and retaliation on the basis of a
suppressed feeling of injustice, and may
once again lead to further riots. It is
therefore necessary that the police must not
hesitate to prosecute every assailant,
irrespective of his status either as a
politician or otherwise. In this connection
we would like to mention that in spite of
inflammatory speeches and articles from Bal Thackeray, the
government is reluctant to effectively and seriously prosecute him
under Sections 153A and 153B of the Indian Penal Code. In the eyes
of a large number of innocent and helpless victims whose suffering
cannot be described in adequate words, he is directly responsible for
their present plight. We find no justification, either moral or legal for
the government's attitude in this behalf.

>This situation
will lead to revenge
on the basis of a
suppressed feeling of
injustice, and may
once again lead to
further riots.

(ii) Many witnesses have deposed before us that their
belongings 'looted by the assailants are still with the looters and that, if
the police had genuinely tried, they could have recovered quite a large
portion of the property. In most of these cases, the looting was done
with a definite modus operandi of initially creating a scare thereby
forcing them to leave their homes and thereafter looting these homes
of its valuables and then damaging and/or setting fire to the same. The
police could have stopped these anti-social activities if they so desired.
In some cases the police only obliged after several days of the incident
with the making of the Panchnamas of the loss suffered, which
Panchnamas have resulted in being of no use to the victims as the
government has not offered, at any time, compensation commensurate
with the loss suffered. Even now, the police can take effective steps to
recover the goods lost by the victims and restore the same to them;
this will go a long way in giving justice to the innocent victims of the
riots. It is on principle that no rioter should be allowed to retain what
he has acquired by loot and plunder.

(iii) We have said that the police have no right to kill. Prima
facie in all cases of police firing resulting in death or injury, the police
are answerable. In our opinion it is necessary that all such cases must
be inquired into, and all such police personnel who have fired
indiscriminately, should be prosecuted, under the provisions of the
Indian Penal Code, for causing injury or death. We have come across
several instances of the police firing at unarmed persons running away
or women and children whilst in their own homes. Women who came
out to the police with raised hands to plead
with them, were also shot at. All such
police personnel deserve to be prosecuted
forthwith. We were given to understand
that some of the police officers who had
indulged in such acts have been transferred
to other police stations. This is an eyewash
and not a punishment. In all cases
where a police officer has killed any
person, there is to be no difference between him and an ordinary
person who has been charged with the same offence. The fact that he
is a police officer cannot be a shield against prosecution.

>Prima facie
in all cases of police
firing resulting in
death or injury,
the police are
answerable.

### (c) Immediate Programmes for Rehabilitation

(i) In order to enthuse the riot affected persons to come back
and settle where they were living before, the government must come
forth with schemes for rehabilitation. It is reported that over 50,000
person amongst a lakh and more who had left Bombay have not yet
returned. The witnesses have stated before us that in many cases only
the male earning members have ventured to come back, leaving the
rest of the family at their native places. Even in the case of persons
who have come back they find that they have no place to stay and no
job to live on. It is therefore necessary that the government
immediately consider various schemes for giving shelter to such
persons. The government must also give them protection against
further assault. The government should also give these persons jobs
such as providing them employment in public works like road making
and/or give them self-employment opportunities. In the absence of
such schemes the sense of injustice which they have been suffering
will continue and lead to further unrest in society. It is regrettable that
the government has not clearly spelt out any scheme for the
rehabilitation of the refugees of these riots. We recommend that the
government must infuse in the administration a sense of urgency in
bringing about such schemes.

(ii) The government and the BMC should come out with a
massive scheme to provide accommodation for persons who have lost
their shelter in the riots. Since the government had not initiated any
such scheme, in certain areas, the affected persons tried to rebuild or
repair their homes of their own accord, or with the help of social
organisations. We regret to say that in certain such cases, the BMC
demolished the rebuilt structures, without taking into account the fact
that these presently homeless people had in
any case been staying in such slums for
years together, as they have never had land
of their own to build on.

>The government
and the BMC should
come out with a
scheme to provide
accommodation for
persons who have
lost their shelter

### (d) Constitution of Tribunals for Payment of Compensation

Immediately on the riots coming
under control, the government announced a
payment of Rs. 250 per riot-affected person. Mostly these amounts
were given to the victims who went to the police station and
complained about injuries either to themselves or their property. Later
on it was announced that in the case of the death of any person in the
riots, his heirs would be given a sum of Rs. 1,00,000 as
compensation. Here again the evidence shows that the government
has given a sum of Rs. 30,000 with a promise that the balance of Rs.
70,000 would be given in the form of Bonds/Certificates which may
be encashed after five years. Some of the witnesses have stated before
us that they have received only Rs. 30,000 and that they have no idea
about the balance amount and how and when the same would be
paid. When there is no record of the death of a person in the hospital,
e.g. for persons who have been killed on the spot and their bodies not
been taken to the hospital, no compensation has been paid. Further, it
is not clear whether the bond would carry any interest and the
impression is that the parties hope to get the balance of Rs. 70,000 at
the end of five years. If in fact no interest is to be paid on the balance
the government must at least be honest enough to confess that they
have not paid at the rate of Rs. 1,00,000 as claimed by them.
Similarly in the case of injured persons the government has not given
any compensation. There are a large number of cases where people
have lost their limbs leading to permanent disability and there is no
justification as to why compensation should not be given to them.
Witnessed deposing before us say that some injured persons hesitated
to go to the government hospitals either because they would be
denied treatment or be accosted by the police there. In some cases
after taking initial treatment at the government Hospital the injured
persons had to shift to private medical care for lack of safety and
security in government hospitals. All these persons have not received
any compensation whatsoever.

In the case of houses which were destroyed during the riots,
some of the persons have received compensation through the revenue
officials. The amounts so distributed have
no relation to the actual value of the house
destroyed. In some cases where the value
amounted to over Rs. 1,00,000 a meagre
compensation of Rs. 5,000 was given by
the revenue officials. The officers also have
reluctantly given such
meagre
compensation, each time insisting on
documentary evidence as proof of the
existence of the house. In the case of several houses the occupants
have lost their valuable documents such as ration cards and
agreements which if insisted upon by the revenue officials is as good
as denying the victims compensation.

>The government
must approach the
question of payment
and compensation on
the basis of sound
guidelines.

The government had earlier not given any compensation
whatsoever in respect of the destruction or loss of movables such as
furniture, fixtures and other household articles precious or otherwise.
The government has now announced that it would give compensation
upto Rs.4,000 in this respect.

It is our view that the government must approach the question
of payment and compensation on the basis of sound guidelines. The
proper solution is to constitute tribunals which should have at least
twenty benches spread over the entire city. These tribunals should be
given clear guidelines for assessment of compensation in respect of the
loss suffered by every individual in the riots. The loss would include
the house, the belongings, the injury sustained and the lives lost. In
our view such tribunals should be set up without any delay so as
to inculcate a feeling of justice being done for the victims of the
We have not been able to appreciate the government's
silence in this respect unless the same be attributed to the
tendency of the government to be utterly indifferent to human
suffering and the violation of human rights.

### (e) Constitution of Special Courts for the Trying of Offenses

If the government could bring in a special law for trying
offenses relating to the security scam, there is no reason as to why
the government cannot set up special courts for trying offenses
committed during the riots. We have seen that in the riots that
took place in Delhi in 1984 after the death of Mrs. Indira Gandhi,
the government would not prosecute the offenders though a large
number of them had been identified. After several agitations and
appeals the government finally decided to prosecute the offenders,
though after nearly six or seven years.
We now know that most of such cases
have failed on account of delay in
registration and prosecution of the cases.
We apprehend that in the present case
also, apart from the reluctance on the
part of the police to prosecute, the delay
in the cases which are registered would
ultimately result in no justice being
rendered to these riot-affected persons.

>If proper justice
be done, the
government should
see to it that all these
cases be disposed off
within a year.

We therefore urge upon the government that if the
government cannot bring in a special law in this behalf, it can at
least earmark special courts for trying the offenses registered in
connection with the cases which arose during the riots. We
understand that the police have, in connection with the riots,
registered about 1,500 cases so far. Several genuine cases and
complaints though, have not been registered. Most of the cases are
to be tried in the Sessions Court. However, at present, the
Bombay City Civil and Sessions Court have cases pending for over
seven or eight years. Therefore, the cases dealing with the riots
will not ordinarily be tried for another ten years or thereabouts.
This will be a total denial of justice to the victims, as also to the
accused. In our view, it is necessary that if proper justice be done,
the government should see to it that all these cases be disposed off
within a year.

## LONG TERM

### (a) Overhauling the Administration, Particularly the Police Force

These riots have revealed that a large number of police
personnel identify themselves with the majority community, as
opposed to the minority one. We have evidence to show that in
certain police stations, the police had insisted that the victims say "Jai
Shree Ram" if they were expected to be shown any consideration, be it
as simple as asking for and being given a glass of water. A slow but
sure erosion of the administration by any communal element, will
ultimately undermine the very secular foundation of this country.

As in politics, so also in administration, there should be no
religion. It is therefore necessary that the administration be screened
and all such elements who owe greater loyalty to communalism than
to the Constitution be weeded out and dealt with severely.

### (b) Revamping and Reorienting the Police Force

It has been argued that the Bombay
police force, numbering about 30,000,
woefully understaffed and ill-equipped to
tackle such social upheavals as communal
riots. However, preventing such situations
or combatting them are neither a numbers game nor a technocratic
exercise. The fact of the matter is that the police failed to perform its
duty of protecting the life and limbs of the Muslims. Merely adding a
couple of thousand persons to the force, will not solve the problem - it
might exacerbate it. It is imperative that Muslims be given a larger
representation, along with other minorities, in the police force as well
as the state reserve police. During the riots, officers from the minority
communities, by and large, played a non-partisan role.

>All such elements
who owe
greater loyalty to
communalism than to
is the Constitution be
weeded out and dealt
with severely.

Furthermore, taking a leaf from international trends, the police
should be compelled to use non-lethal methods (water hoses, rubber
bullets, tear-gas, etc.), to tackle situations involving large groups of
people. Society should move towards more humane, rather than
barbaric forms of controlling crowds, even if they are on the rampage.

### (c) The Centre's Responsibility

When the riots broke out in Bombay the army was sent for but
the army was not given orders to shoot. At some places the army was
even prevented from maintaining law and order. A large number of
persons belonging to the minority community fled when several of
their own people were killed. There were allegations of the police
having connived with these rioters, but surprisingly the Centre did not
take any action. Even the Prime Minister who paid a visit to the city
did nothing. We regret that the Centre should exhibit such indifference
to human misery whereas the need of the hour was to come to the
rescue of the minorities. We consider it the duty of the Central
government to intervene when the state administration joins hands
with the majority or refuses to intervene when the majority community
attacks the minority. If such indifference is allowed to continue and if
at every instance the state joins hands with a particular ethnic group
which is in the majority, the minority will have no one to depend on.
This would ultimately lead to the violation of fundamental rights of the
minority group. It amounts to the negation of democracy itself.

The Central government cannot
consider this merely as a law and order
problem. It is therefore necessary to
consider, that whenever the majority
community attacks a minority community
(maybe of religious or linguistic
denomination), and when the state
administration sides with the majority it
becomes a matter of Constitutional
breakdown. In all such cases it becomes the duty of the Central
government to come to the rescue of the minority community, not only
to restore law and order, but also to set right the balance between the
two groups . If over two lakh people had to flee from their homes
and thousands were injured or dead, all due to the failure of the state
administration, it cannot be said that governance is being carried on in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Not that there
should have been any declaration of emergency, but that the Centre
could have intervened by exercising executive power, based on Article
355, read with Entry 2,2A of List I and Entry 1 of List II and Entry 1 of
List III of Schedule VII of the Constitution of India. We regret that the
Central government failed to recognise the magnitude of the problem.

>It is the duty of the
Central government
to intervene when the
state administration
joins hands with the
majority.

### (d) Law to Penalise the Rioters

After the riots, several voluntary associations came forward to
collect funds for relief work and to organise relief and rehabilitation
schemes. The government has also paid compensation, though
ultimately at the cost of all tax payers and citizens. However, the
rioters and the parties who have incited such rioting have gone scotfree,
without any obligation to bear what society has lost in general
and what the riot-affected have lost in particular. This is in our view,
an intolerable situation. The persons or groups responsible for the
looting and destruction must be compelled to make good the damages
suffered by the victims of the riots.

For this purpose, the government must enact a suitable law,
which must provide for the identification of such groups or
organisations and find a means to recover compensation from them.
In our view, it will not be difficult to identify such groups. For
example, in the present riots, after nearly every _maha-arti_, there was
large-scale rioting and destruction of property. It is an acknowledged
fact that _maha-artis_ were organised by the Shiv Sena and the BJP
Even otherwise, when any association or party stages a morcha which
eventually results in stone-throwing,
causing damage to people and property,
the organisers of the said morcha must be
held responsible for the consequences. If,
they cannot control their own people, they
have no right to incite them. In all ethnic
or communal riots, it is the leaders who
escape, whilst the individuals are left to face
the music.

>There should be no
religion in politics,
just as there should be
no politics in religion
(Articles 25 and 26).

### (e) The Need to Resuscitate Secularism

"Secularism is dead; long live secularism." This could as well be
the motto of several political parties in the country. When the BJP
leader L.K.Advani, calls these parties "pseudo-secularists" he is not far
from the truth. They have only paid lip service to secular principles.
Thus, even now, we witness the sad spectacle of the Prime Minister
trying to set up Shankaracharyas against the VHP and Bajrang Dal, in
an attempt to contain the thrust of the _Hindutva_vadi's goal of achieving
power at the Centre. The Prime Minister does not seem to realise that
in any such competition, secularism will be the ultimate casualty.

Our Constitution includes secularism and, that being one of its
basic features, cannot be altered. In real terms, it means that there
should be no religion in politics, just as there should be no politics in
religion (Articles 25 and 26). But, unfortunately, during the last four
decades, expediency became the rule and not Constitutional
principles. The ruling party, as also the Opposition, found it easier to
exploit the people by catering to their primeval proclivities, rather than
trying to reform the people by helping raise their economic and social
standards. The aim of our Constitution is to have a society where
there is justice - social, economic and political. This has still remained
a distant dream for WE THE PEOPLE OF INDIA. The politicians still
think that the continued exploitation of the people, on the basis of
religion, caste or community, will make the people forget their
Constitution and its objectives. The present campaign to subvert the
Constitution on the basis of _Hindutva_ and, the resultant riots all over
the country is the most vulgar form of exploitation. It is not too late
for the government to cry a halt against these diabolic forces of
communal cleavage by taking speedy, effective and sustained steps
based on secular principles.

This must involve a two-fold thrust; political and legal. The
latter would include, apart from various administrative measures and
executive actions, an amendment of the electoral Law so as to
disqualify those parties as are contesting on the basis of
communalism. This must be determined, not on the grounds of their
declared aims and objectives, as found in their party's manifesto, which
generally camouflages their real intent, but on the basis of their actual
programmes and deliberations. If Bal Thackeray's repeated utterances
in the _Saamna_ and also his conversations as reported in the "Time"
magazine and elsewhere, are taken into account; it would be sufficient
to disqualify his party from contesting the elections, for his party does
not bear true allegiance to the oath that is taken on the Constitution of
India.
