# Introduction

_by Sunil Kumar_

December 6, 1992 ... the day a sixteenth century mosque was
demolished. A day that carries a vignette of images: youths dancing
on the domes of the Babri masjid, cudgeling it to rubble, national
politicians haranguing the congregation on to greater hatred and
violence, policemen standing by as mute spectators and journalists
threatened and manhandled. These snapshots do not do justice,
however, to the atrocity that was December 6, 1992.

To capture the true implications of its horror we have to scroll
back a few years to 1990 and the _Rath Yatra_, the ceremonial
procession of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Lal Krishan
Advani. In an effort to mobilise electoral support Mr Advani
appeared as the champion of Lord Rama. Advani's yatra invoked a
reading of history where it was claimed that Mir Baqī, a commander
of the first Mughal emperor, Babur (r. 1526-30), destroyed a temple
consecrating the site of Lord Rama's birth. Babur and his military
commander profaned the sacred area, the Ramjanmabhumi, by
constructing a mosque on the site of the temple. This grievous
injury to the sentiment of the Hindu community was intolerable and,
nearly six centuries after the event, the BJP and its president made
the restitution of past wrongs to the Hindu community a central
agenda in their political manifesto. Mr Advani's yatra traversed
several states in north India spreading its message of hatred and
spite, urging people to greater self-pride, mobilising them in a war
to protect their culture, their religion, their state. Indeed, Advani's
yatra quickly transcended from election rhetoric to a full-fledged
campaign against the secular modern state of India. It was a battle
against the incumbent government and all others in the past who did
not demolish Babur's offensive mosque on the Ramjanmabhumi.
Advani and his peers argued that secular sentiments only pampered
the minority community even as they trampled Hindu pride. The
yatra was therefore a 'liberation struggle', led by Mr Advani
astride his festooned Toyota chariot, a caricature of Rama's mythic
battle against the anti-hero, Ravana, a Hindu nationalism that was
majoritarian and blatantly militant in character.

In its wake, Advani's yatra spread violence and divisiveness.
The country experienced some of the worst communal conflicts of
the century in 1990. But this was only the beginning.

Scroll forward some weeks beyond December 1992 and the
destruction of the Babri masjid by cadres and volunteers (_kar sevaks_)
brought to Ayodhya by the BJP and its associates, the Vishwa Hindu
Parishad (VHP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
Even as Advani celebrated the destruction of the mosque that had
brought him such significance as a national politician, communal
riots burned the country for two months. Through the months of
December and January 1992-3, communal conflict left over 3,000
dead. Within a week, conservative estimates put 600 people killed
in Bombay alone. Women and children were hunted down in the
streets; domiciles and business establishments left smoldering
for days. Countless were left homeless, orphaned, widowed and
raped. They remained anonymous, part of no official statistics, their
trauma presumably insignificant in a historical frame that shifted
very quickly to the utopia of a destined _Ram-rajya_.

Over fifteen years have passed since the events of December
6th 1992. Much has transpired in the interim. Lal Krishan Advani
was, for a while, the Deputy Prime Minister of India and, quite
ironically for a person who broke his pledge to the Supreme Court
and exhorted _kar sevaks_ to destroy the mosque, also the country's
Home Minister. The BJP used its term in office (1999--2004) to
consolidate its recent electoral gains. Hindutva mobilization during
the last two decades of the past millennium --- their inroads into the
public domain and the global nexus of many of these developments
--- has been the subject of considerable research, not least of all by
authors writing in the Readings published by the Three Essays
Collective. If there is any common thread running amidst this body
of writing, it is the warning that the conflagration in Gujarat in the
spring of 2002 was not an aberration: the methodical planning, the
killing of minority groups, violence perpetrated on women and
children were all a part of a cynical agenda at ethnic-cleansing, the
move to terrorise minorities and create a homogenous, majoritarian
society by Hindutva agencies. Yet, although the systematic
violence perpetrated on the Muslim population in Gujarat was a
pogrom, aided and abetted by a collusive state machinery, it was
successful in its electoral goals. Hindutva mobilization in Gujarat
was successful enough in translating these macabre events into a
huge victory during the 2003 and 2007 state elections. Repelling
as it may sound, it was not surprising that these electoral gains
were seen by Hindutva forces as a vindication of their methods of
social engineering.

These were disquieting trends: where repulsive violence
and murder could be tolerated, even exonerated, in the cause of
purifying the body politic. No one factor can help explain these
developments and certainly a study of the short duration can only
help us understand the manner in which some of these processes
consolidated and enabled Hindutva successes. Take, for example,
the challenge to India's secular identity through ongoing efforts
to rationalise the reading of the country's past along communal
lines. Even as professional scholars have discarded the nineteenth
century colonial trifurcation of Indian history into Hindu, Muslim
and the British periods because of its racial, religious and colonial
presuppositions, new and even more pernicious ideologies are
reintroducing these modes of interpretation in the public realm.

I say 'reintroducing' because the impact of communal sensibilities
on the interpretation of Indian history is a long one in which a variety
of different people were involved. In the context of colonial critiques
of a moribund, effete Indian civilisation, the writings of some early
nationalists in the late nineteenth century represent one strand. They
wanted to create a national identity, a history that represented the
glories of the subcontinent's past, a narrative that could unite its
multi-cultural complexity. They could do this in many ways, but one
unhappy choice centred upon the identification of 'heroes' whose
actions could inspire a new generation of patriotic Indians. As a
result they wrote histories, popular stories and plays, valorising
the conduct of heroes such as Prithviraj Chauhan, Shivaji and
Rana Pratap. The early nationalists wanted to indoctrinate a new
generation of Indians to fight courageously against their British
colonial oppressors, to learn about patriotism and nationalism
from the life stories of these immortal personalities. And they
were enormously successful: the evocative stories of these heroes
had a huge circulation. Many of their more patriotic epics are still
included in history and Hindi textbooks of school children. What
is ignored in the retelling of these histories is the manner in which
their narratives led generations of children into assuming that
Hindus and Indians were congruent categories. Or the manner in
which these stories juxtaposed protagonists: Hindus/Indians were
the ones who bravely resisted the foreign/Muslim invaders, aliens
who colonised India in an earlier period. Successive generations
of Indian citizens were reared under the belief that to be proud of
one's nation meant that one was equally proud of being a Hindu,
and patriotism meant resisting both, British and Muslim aggression.
It also helped to consolidate the seriously flawed impression that
'Hindus' are a monolithic religious and social community, the
subcontinent's primordial residents. Conversely Muslims are almost
universally regarded as a monolithic group, foreigners to India
because of their history and alien culture.

These nineteenth and early twentieth century ideas were.
nurtured in history textbooks, popular literature and the media,
until they came to possess a commonsensical validity that was
rarely subjected to critical interrogation. It was in an attempt to curb
the dissemination of these sentiments that the Indian government,
still inspired by its socialistic, secular Nehruvian ideals, decided
to produce textbooks that were 'scientifically oriented' so that
they could provide an objective, secular interpretation of Indian
history. The task was given to the National Council of Educational
Research and Training (NCERT), a nodal body responsible for the
development of school curricula and pedagogical enhancement in
the country.

Given the level of underdevelopment and poverty, the vast social
and ideological complexities surrounding questions of literacy,
gender emancipation, racial, caste and religious prejudices through
the 1960s and 70s, a proactive role of the state in the affairs of
education was welcome. Certainly the history textbooks of the time
were written by professional historians whose eminence in their
respective fields was universally recognized. Their historiographies
reflected an emphasis on economic determinism and class struggles,
a means to move beyond hero-centred and religious-community
based interpretations. A good beginning, perhaps, but barring
minor updates, these texts remained in circulation for nearly two
decades!

When the NDA government came to power, the BJP controlled
the ministries that governed the nation's educational and cultural
policies. Institutions like the University Grants Commission (UGC),
the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), the Indian Council
for Cultural Relations (ICCR) and the Archaeological Survey of
India (ASI) were staffed with either BJP cadres or individuals
whose 'pragmatic' ideologies allowed for an easy collaboration
with the BJP regime in exchange for career advancement. Indeed,
patronage politics may have had a long institutional history in
post-independence India but the goals of the BJP, propelled as it
was by its saffron agencies, should never be forgotten. More than
ever before, the acquisition of power provided the BJP with the
opportunity to financially sponsor and direct public reflection on
questions of identity and social relations from a majoritarian Hindu
perspective.

Under the BJP regime, school curricula was revamped and
history textbooks rewritten. Normally this is a useful, important
exercise where recent historiographical trends can be incorporated
in school texts and students introduced to the basics of the discipline.
The garnering of additional or different 'facts' and details alone
is ordinarily not a part of this exercise. Instead, rewriting history
textbooks implies rethinking how the discipline of history can
be conveyed to young minds. It involves an attempt to introduce
students to the kinds of evidence used by historians in their research.
These texts should try to debate different ways of reading evidence;
carry the excitement of new horizons in historical research opened
up by archaeology, art history and literature; warn students about
the problems of anachronistic and teleological reasoning in history.
In other words, rather than a rote learning of arcane information,
greater attention to how and why historians select their 'facts' and
weave them into their arguments would teach students more about
history than an evaluation of the qualities of a 'classical age' or the
reasons for the 'decline of an empire'.

How do social, political and economic processes, for example,
structure and shape life? How are ideologies and beliefs constructed
by both, subaltern classes and dominant elites, sometimes as
resistance to class oppression? In what ways do master-narratives
of imperial formations make the writing of regional, class and
gender sensitive histories difficult? Is the study of change intrinsic to
history? Historians today are studying these questions in interesting
and innovative ways but it should hardly surprise us that the revised
history textbooks eschewed debates or the processes of historical
inquiry. They instead provided 'facts' and the ones that they choose
to stress --- and ignore --- were significant.

According to the revised NCERT textbooks 'facts' proved that
Indian civilisation sprang fully formed---caste system, cow worship,
et al. --- in the Vedic age, at the dawn of global civilisation, circa
2500 BC or earlier. They teach that the dharmashastras and other
brahmanical normative texts with a limited circulation were instead
the legal digests that shaped life and political constitutions of the
ancient Indian regimes. This is now marked as India's heritage,
one that students need to honour and cherish. In other words,
together with the Vedas, Hinduism had its genesis at the dawn
of time, and this religion governed every facet of life in a period
that should correctly be described as the 'Hindu Period' of Indian
history. Students were asked to memorise facts that confirm how
a sacred, becalmed, unchanging golden age of the ancient world
suffered only one, serious, traumatic dislocation: the coming of
Islam and Muslims into the subcontinent. This 'foreign' religion
and its followers corrupted the pristine Vedic world of the Hindus
and introduced traditions like purdah, dowry and cow slaughter.

The demolition of the Babri masjid and Hindutva mobilization
through the 1990s, its attack upon the discipline of history and the
increasing communal polarisation of Indian society was strongly
challenged by professional historians of a variety of ideological
spectrums. It led to the production of some fascinating research in
social history, religion, gender studies, nationalism, the history of
ideas and caste, all of which complicated simple-minded renditions
of history that juxtaposed monolithic communities in perpetual
conflict. Unfortunately, much of this recent work circulates within
the walls of the academy: professional historians writing for
their colleagues and research students. Not enough of this work
has penetrated into the realm of school textbooks. With the sole
exception of some vernacular presses, many with leftist sympathies,
the public domain is still prey to 'pulp history' that narrates the past
within simple binary templates: heroes versus villains; the virtuous
against the immoral and the nationalist Hindu in conflict with the
foreign Muslim or British forces.

The collection of essays in this volume hopes to bridge the
serious gap between historical research available in the academy
and the materials accessible to school and college teachers, students
and other interested readers. It is hoped that this compilation of
essays by historians will help secular minded Indians formulate
their ideas with greater confidence and coherence and make others
doubt their first assumptions.

The theme of temple desecration and destruction in the medieval
period was deliberately chosen for this book because the subject
has a direct bearing upon the Babri Masjid-Ramjanmabhumi
issue, a subject that has divided the country for so many years and
shed so much blood. Much of the literature on the Babri Masjid-
Ramjanmabhumi issue has centred on the validity or weakness in
the claims of the various litigants. For many people the controversy
has now whittled down to the pivotal question: was there an ancient
Ram temple on the site of Babur's (demolished) mosque? The
subject is now pending before the Supreme Court. As a part of its
efforts to resolve the controversy the Supreme Court ordered the
Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to ascertain whether there
were any prior constructions under the now demolished Babri
Masjid.

From a variety of different perspectives, this was a baffling
intervention. The Indian subcontinent has one of the longest
histories of human settlements in the world and excavations in
most places have revealed layers upon layers of human habitation,
sometimes stretching beyond the last two millennia. Of all the
different types of material remains, that may hypothetically remain
buried under the site of the demolished mosque, why is a Hindu
temple singled out as an object of such interest? Indeed, even though
the site was considerably disturbed, excavations at the Babri Masjid
site revealed the evidence of early habitation and material remains
from a variety of different time periods. Some artefacts were
identified rather ambiguously as belonging to the early medieval
period and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) suggested
that they indicated the presence of a large construction. The nature
of these artefacts, not least their precise temporal contexts, were
difficult to determine with any sense of accuracy. Following a
comparative methodology, the ASI concluded that these were in
the nature of materials belonging to a huge temple from the early
medieval period.

The evidence was hardly equivocal on this point. Other
archaeologists who also studied the evidence suggested that the
artefacts on the basis of which the ASI postulated the presence of a
huge temple were not the bases of pillars at all. Doubts arose from
the quality of the remains, their grid locations and the stratographic
levels at which they were discovered. Perhaps, even more telling
was their criticism regarding the selective study of data by the ASI,
the manner in which some parts of the evidence were highlighted
and other parts diluted. Some evidence was recorded in the ASI
report only after independent observers on the site protested at their
exclusion. The motivated nature of the excavations and the biases
in its report were further underlined by the extremely inconsistent
chronological methods followed by the Survey. Were some of the
discovered artefacts from the Sultanate period or earlier? In the
context of the 'Hindu--Muslim' binarism that was guiding the whole
inquiry this was hardly a small issue. The manner in which the
ASI report glossed over data inconvenient to its larger conclusions
hardly reassured critics of its impartial conduct in the inquiry.

The debate around the Ramjanmabhumi/Babri masjid issue and
the report of the Archaeological Survey actually underscored the
paucity of historical and archaeological information available to
conclude with any certainty whether a temple existed on the site of
the demolished mosque. If anything, the ambiguous results of the
Archaeological Survey of India excavations have provided material
to contending parties to argue their respective cases even more
vociferously. In the interim however, by getting the ASI involved in
this debate, the Supreme Court has succeeded in forever tarnishing
the institution's reputation; for many, the Survey's Hindutva biases
are now confirmed.

But beyond these debates are the larger questions that the
Supreme Court seems to have ignored. Not the least of which pertain
to the disciplines of history and archaeology that were deployed
to provide facts for a case under litigation. Puranic histories, epic
tales and decontextualised material remains of uncertain provenance
are not the sources with which historians or archaeologists can
answer questions posed by present day politicians. Certainly the
nature of the debate itself lends to a presentist reading of the past,
a teleology that is methodologically suspect for its selective sifting
of facts to suit divergent political arguments. This is a method that
professional historians and archaeologists would eschew in the
practice of their trade. But thanks to the Supreme Court decision
to use the Archaeological Survey of India as a detective agency it
is exactly these scholastic traditions of social science research that
are now under threat.

In its search for facts to ascertain whether the Babri masjid
was constructed on the site of a Hindu temple, the Supreme Court
seems to have completely ignored the central question: can an event
that supposedly transpired in the sixteenth century be treated as a
grievance and redressed in the twenty-first? Will the desecration
of Vaishnavite temples by Shaivites or the destruction of Buddhist
sacred places by a variety of Hindu agencies be judged by the same
yardstick? It is significant that Hindutva ideologues have now
started arguing that the Supreme Court verdict notwithstanding,
the Ramjanmabhumi temple will be constructed. Hindu religious
and emotional sentiments demand this; the state, its courts and the
country's constitution are peripheral to the issue! The clamour of
demographic numbers implies that majoritarian sentiments should
now definitively determine policy. Neither history nor archaeology
is actually pertinent in this argument and Indians can never remain
confident where the search for restitution of past injury will take the
nation next. Are Mathura and Kashi included amongst the places
awaiting 'liberation'? Will the 'recapturing' of sites lost in some
mythic past also legitimize the destruction of neighbourhood Sufi
shrines as in Gujarat in 2002? What criteria are we going to use to
construct our history of grievances and whom are we appointing
to undertake this task for us?

***

The essays in this volume do not engage with the Babri masjid-
Ramjanmabhumi controversy directly. They however pick up
several issues integral to the manner in which debates around this
episode are framed. The first essay in this collection by Richard
Davis studies the question of looting temples and discusses its
meanings within the medieval context of state formation and
conquest. In a startling departure from the 'commonsensical' take
on Indian history where the looting and desecration of Hindu
temples is always associated with Muslim invaders, Davis studies
the looting of temples carried out by 'Hindu' Rajas. It is little known
that victorious Hindu Rajas pillaged the temples of their vanquished
rivals, looted their idols and installed them as war trophies in
their own temples. The systematic practice of this iconoclasm and
plunder of each other's temples by Hindu rulers was integral to
their claims of universal lordship bestowed by God. Davis's work
makes the crucial point that warfare and looting were adjuncts to
the constitution of medieval political authority. 'Looting' cannot
be interpreted through modern filters as a disruption of a stable
political and moral order. Instead we need to remember that the
later constructed Lakshman temple in Khajuraho was specially
commissioned by the Candella Raja Yaśovarman to house the
solid-gold Vişņu statue he had looted from the Pratihara rulers. The
looting and desecration of a competitor's deity, its reinstallation by
the conqueror in his own temple were important public declarations
of the defeat of an old ruler and the arrival of a new political lord
and master of the region.

The practice of looting and desecrating temples of political
competitors was an important aspect in the construction of a
dominant political formation. This was as true for victorious Hindu
rulers, as it was for Muslim ones in the Middle Ages. Equally, if the
looting of temples was a part of a more general pre-modern political
culture --- the religious denomination of the ruler notwithstanding
---then the question of restitution of past grievances is impossible
to pursue. Central to Davis's study is the manner in which modern
historians should comprehend medieval practices of authority
and conquest. What are the skills required in translating and
communicating medieval lexicons of power into modern historical
narratives? Or, turning the question around, one could also ask about
the nature of modern filters that guide our interpretation of pre-
modern political conduct in India from such a biased perspective.
Why is it that iconoclasm and temple desecration is so universally
associated with Muslims in our history textbooks and the popular
imagination? Why are we so universally uninformed about the more
general phenomenon of temple desecration carried out by Medieval
rulers, Hindus and Muslims alike?

Romila Thapar's article on the destruction of the temple of
Somnath by Mahmud of Ghazni addresses this question squarely.
Historians generally describe the destruction of this temple as
an event of cataclysmic proportions that marked the onset of the
Muslim/Medieval period and with it the start of a routine desecration
of Hindu temples by Muslims. These events were reported in the
Persian chronicles of the Delhi Sultans and Mughal Padishahs
and often the evidence of ruined temples is still visible to modern
visitors. For many historians, therefore, Islamic iconoclasm was
not a subject worthy of further investigation; it was an inescapable
fact.

Romila Thapar's work, however, questions the 'evidence'
that supports these assumptions. She studies the manner in which
different narratives of the destruction of Somnath were written.
Contrary to received opinion, the author explains, the Somnath
temple was not an important site of worship for Hindus in the tenth
century. As Romila Thapar points out, the importance of the temple
of Somnath was, quite ironically, the creation of Persian historians
who were the ones to suggest that it was a pivotal religious centre
for Hindus in India. This helped to burnish Mahmud of Ghazni's
reputation as the non-pariel iconoclastic destroyer of his time and
for later authors, a rhetorical trope that could function as a paradigm
of Muslim sovereignty in India. The Persian narrativisation of the
Somnath expedition was, however, only one of several accounts;
there were several other interesting ways in which this event was
also redeployed. Jain authors, for instance, claimed the destruction
of the Somnath temple as a proof of the superior power of Jainism
over Saivism: Mahavir protected Jain temples while Siva remained
powerless to protect his adherents.

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries British and later
nationalist historians further burnished the image of Somnath, not
just as a central icon within a Hindu geography of sacred sites,
but as a symbol of India's injured pride that needed restoration.
Ironically the British colonial regime was the first to don the mantle
of restorer of Indian/Hindu pride, a sentiment that was appropriated
by some nationalist leaders in the twentieth century. The complex
past of Somnath was completely erased by a nationalist pride that
re-consecrated a newly constructed temple on the site in 1951 and
restored Indian/Hindu honour. As Romila Thapar points out in her
essay, rather than the 'facts' surrounding Somnath it is the manner
in which the event was historicised at selective stages of its past that
provides it with the national significance it carries in our memory
today. And let us not forget, in 1990 Lal Krishan Advani deliberately
evoked only one aspect of the past when he started his _Rath yatra_
to Ayodhya from Somnath.

The modern experience of communal conflict and partition
certainly directs our concern to questions of community
consciousness, identity formation and conflict in the pre-modern
period. These are important questions but as the research of Davis
and Thapar suggests, the pre-history of modern sensibilities are
sometimes so distant from us today that we need to study them
as if we were engaging with an unfamiliar culture. Learning the
language and the grammar of the texts that report on past social
practices and beliefs provides historians with the skills to discover
the complex manner in which 'reality' was constructed by a variety
of mediating agencies: religious and historical texts, art, architecture
and so on. Reading the past from this perspective means that we
cannot simply depend upon the evidence of 'reliable sources'
but have to interrogate them and carry out our own independent
investigation. This could lead historians to conclusions that do not
support a variety of apriori assumptions. Certainly, as the work of
Davis and Thapar points out, a careful reading of past evidence
disturbs central assumptions that we carry with us without any
further reflection. Muslim iconoclasm, the importance of Somnath
for Hindus are ahistoricised assumptions that help in fashioning
the sense of a Hindu India where Muslims are violent intruders.
The genealogy supporting the history of grievance is remarkably
weak and one-sided.

But this is also the reason why the discipline of history cannot
be used to support presentist ultra-nationalist political agendas. It is
also the reason why so much historical research is violently attacked
today and denied circulation. We cannot suffer the thought that
'Indians' in the Vedic age--- the great 'Aryans' themselves - ate beef!
The historian that suggested this must be anti-nationalist. He and his
work must be violently condemned. Simple narratives that provide
linear connections with the great traditions of the past are, on the
other hand, touted as veritable truths. As we search for our identities
in a post-colonial world, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata
suddenly emerge as vivid images through which we can construct
national and family traditions. The NCERT textbooks of the NDA
regime are culpable in the circulations of these ideologies. What
we need instead is a more intensive, transparent debate about the
manner in which we construct our histories, a discussion of the
sources that historians use (and ignore) and the methods that they
deploy towards their analysis.

The third essay in this collection, by Richard Eaton, engages
with the debate surrounding temple desecration very directly. To
begin with, Eaton sifts through the most commonly cited sources
supporting the general assumption that Muslims desecrated Hindu
temples. Eaton tabled the information regarding the desecration
of temples chronologically and then mapped the evidence
geographically. His conclusions were fascinating. Rather than
reporting a random record of Muslim iconoclasm, there was a clear
pattern of temple desecration across hostile frontiers as invading
armies faced resistance. Alternatively, temple desecration took
place during revolts. Eaton also asked if Muslims were inherently
iconoclastic: did they, in other words, desecrate all temples? His
research suggested otherwise. Only temples constructed by royal
patrons or their political agents were desecrated.

Eaton's investigation confirmed Davis' research: royal temples
were public arenas where imperial authority was ritually legitimated
and hierarchical relationships with subordinate chieftains
consolidated through a variety of transactional relationships. The
defeat of a ruler provoked the public humiliation of his 'signs' of
authority by the victorious army. This was a part of the culture of
power and authority that was enacted in different ways by both,
Hindu and Muslim rulers in the medieval period. Only royal temples
during moments of conflict were desecrated. By contrast, temples
that did not 'challenge' the regnant authority were protected as
state-property and their continued patronage was evidence of the
universal justice that righteous kings claimed was maintained in
their realm. This was an accolade that Muslim rulers cherished and
often received from their 'Hindu' subjects, 'facts' not commonly
known and certainly absent in NCERT textbooks or BJP rhetoric.
Certainly, once temple desecration is placed within the context
of medieval kingship and the consecration of royal authority it
no longer appears as evidence of irrational, fanatical, religious
bigotry. Both Hindu and Muslim rulers comprehended its political
and religious iconography and its enactment had a very precise
historical context.

The need to emphasise the historical context to understand the
nature of iconoclasm was also stated by Barry Flood, the author
of the fourth essay in this volume. Flood, an art historian, queried
the notion of Islamic iconoclasm and asked the simple question:
are Muslims the same everywhere through all periods of time? The
answer was an obvious, no! Flood further asked: if the quality of
being a Muslim was historically and regionally determined, then
how historically sensitive were general ascriptions of Muslims
as pathologically iconoclastic fanatics? Surely the nature of
iconoclasm was touched by a variety of contingent historical factors
and not just a general Weberian Muslim one?

This was a line of interrogation very close to the one followed
by Eaton but Flood revisited the question of 'Islamic' iconoclasm
by a review of Ghurid aesthetics. As he argued, Ghurid aesthetics
were strongly impressed with Indic decorative forms. The masjid-i
sangi at Larvand in Afghanistan decorated with vase-and-foliage
capitals, lotus scrolls and half-lotus friezes underscored the positive
aesthetic value attached by the Ghurids to standard decorative
elements of Indic architecture. In Flood's argument, this aesthetic
was also apparent in the iconoclasm practiced by the Ghurids in
India. Rather than a generic 'Islamic' iconoclasm, Flood suggested,
study the materials destroyed or defaced so that we can better
appreciate the choices made by the iconoclasts. Flood studied
the evidence of the Qutb mosque in Delhi and placed it in the
larger context of Ghurid architecture in Afghanistan and north
India. Barring a few exceptions, anthropomorphic imagery was
mutilated in the mosque but other representational forms, including
figural imagery --- also forbidden in Islam --- was left untouched.
This included elephants, birds and mythological creatures such as
maqaras and the kirtimukha, the horned lion, which 'became as
ubiquitous a figure \[in Ghurid mosques in north India\] as it had been
in pre-Ghurid Buddhist stupas and Hindu temples'. In other words,
the Qutb witnessed a selective iconoclasm, one that was motivated
by a deliberate choice that left intact figural representation that the
Ghurids preferred aesthetically.

Taken together with Eaton's arguments, Flood's research points
to the importance of moving away from easy interpretations of
'random and fanatic Muslim iconoclasm' to a more nuanced
analysis of the agencies involved in the event. The desecration of
temples was a deliberate event enacted by victorious Hindu and
Muslim rulers over vanquished kings and rebels. But as Flood
suggests we can carry the study of desecration further. There was
an appreciation of decorative styles and imagery that spanned
what we today refer to as juxtaposed and homogenized 'Hindu
and Muslim' worlds and this inflected the direction and extent
of desecration of idols. Flood makes the additional point that the
study of iconoclasm is prefigured within an ahistorical, synchronic
universe, where the destructive as well as the creative impulse is
removed from the processes of artistic creation and recreation.
While today we can only bemoan the mutilated idol, Flood suggests
a rereading of the iconoclastic moment as a tranformative one where
a new aesthetic was represented. This is evident if we study the
Qutb mosque as a unitary whole where it is virtually impossible to
extract despoliated elements from the newer materials. Just as the
Candella Raja's Lakshman temple in Khajuraho is not remembered
today as a site constructed to house the looted Vişņu statue of the
Pratihara rulers, the creative energies deployed at the moment of
reconstruction in the Qutb mosque also need to be appreciated
outside the genealogy of grievance that has completely seized our
historical imagination.

The essays of Davis, Thapar, Eaton and Flood also touch upon
'religion' and 'politics' in overlapping ways. Although they do not
explicitly discuss it in their essays, it is clear that when they talk
about 'religion' they refer not merely to organized belief systems,
but also to the texts, rituals, art forms and public arenas where
they were re-produced. In an important sense, 'religion' for these
authors was not merely a life-orientational idea that transcended a
material reality, but an ideology that had a sacred resonance with
an identifiable material context. And because it was more than
personal piety--- an individual's search for absolute truth---religion's
organizational aspect, its changing institutional form, was a crucial
subject of historical inquiry. All the essays in this book cover a time
period spanning the 8th through the 18th centuries of the Common
Era, a thousand years of enormous change in the complexion of
religion and social organizations. These were the years of political
empowerment of a variety of marginalized groups, when pastoralists
and low-caste warriors seized authority and established their
separate dynasties all over the subcontinent. These were centuries
of considerable political conflict when authority was constantly
challenged by new aspirants. Brief moments of political stability
were celebrated: temples were built, grants disbursed to religious
elites and eulogies in praise of new and relatively unknown political
masters narrated in inscriptions and texts.

The construction of the grand medieval temple, in other words,
was related to the new political and social organizations that
emerging political groups and their collaborators wanted to endow
with moral sanctity. Their desecration was intrinsic to the ongoing
process of political and social change characteristic of this time
period. Those who had vested interests in preserving an old order,
not surprisingly, produced much of the literature of the period that
bemoaned the character of this change. The pastoralists, or the
groups that eventually proclaimed themselves as Rajputs, hardly
had reason to abhor the cataclysmic events that brought them to
power. But once they were in power they condemned threats to
their authority by demons and foreigners even as they suggested
a primordial, divine right to authority. The irony behind these
ascriptions should not be missed; in another context and at an
earlier time period, some of these parvenu warriors were described
by the power of the day as barbarians and agents that introduced
the _kali-yug_.

Temple-desecration, then, is of great significance for the entry
that it provides us into questions of medieval social, political,
and religious organizations, into the manner in which authority
and social hierarchies were constructed, legitimated, torn down
or redeployed in the Middle Ages. These are exciting questions
regarding historical change through which social structures in the
subcontinent were reinvented, a dialectic that was integral to the
processes that shaped our modern history. We can remain trapped
with memories of injury and grievance only if we rather surreally
identify with the protagonists involved in the conflicts that raged
in the subcontinent a thousand years ago. And we can only do so
by completely decontextualising the conflict and ourselves, by
inhabiting a 'Wonderland' where somebody like L. K. Advani can
imagine for a moment that he is Rama's avenger in combat with
the generals of the Mughal emperor Babur! This is political rhetoric
not history and it deserves as much credence as the American
President's claims to represent the forces of civilization in a just
war against the evil state of Iraq.

Political rhetoric, however, attempts to gain credence through its
own deployment of 'history', a practice that we need to recognize
for its presentist, motivated agendas. In contrast to the four essays
by professional historians, the appendix to this book is not by a
historian, but by an individual who frequently deploys the past to
mobilize political opinion and rationalize the actions of his party-
members. The former Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee,
is a savant, not just a politician of considerable experience but a
poet whose nuanced speeches are very rich in their allusions to
the past and how they reflect on the present. In the Appendix of
this volume is the text of a speech that he delivered at Somnath on
October 31st, 2001, on the fiftieth anniversary of the reconstruction
of the temple.

In it the Prime Minister recalled how Somnath was an example
of 'our' sanatan dharma, 'our' pure \[brahmanical\] culture, 'our'
shashwat dharma, 'our' eternal culture. He noticed that it was an
example of the continuous change present in Indian history. India
and Somnath both faced foreign invasions in the past. Somnath
was destroyed, but the Prime Minister noted that just as 'we'
rebuilt Somnath, made a new Somnath and triumphed over those
that sought to destroy it, we will also be victorious over terrorists
who do not want to worship idols but destroy them. Vajpayee's
speech was brilliantly crafted for its recourse to several overlapping
illusions: a pure, brahmanical timeless civilisation of India, a
civilisation where Somnath and India were synonymous, where
both faced foreign invasions, Muslim invaders in the past who were
seamlessly transported into the present as terrorists who challenged
India's integrity. The rebuilding of the modern nation along its
original dharmic ideals was captured in the history of the ruined
Somnath temple. Somnath was an example of the challenges India
had faced in the past and the rebuilt temple and pilgrimage centre
was a sign of a new united India that was honest to its cultural past
and committed to modernity and progress. In the Prime Minister's
speech old nationalist leaders like Sardar Vallabhai Patel who had
championed the cause of temple reconstruction in Somnath were
appropriated within the Hindutva fold. Somnath and Gujarat, ruled
by the BJP, gestured towards a Hindu imagination of a new India.
Temple desecration was an event in the past and temple restoration
was marked as the symbol of a new, proud, Hindu nation.

But what messages does this speech carry regarding the
history of India, leave alone its secular character? Gujarat burnt
not longer than five months after the Prime Minister's speech.
Muslims were branded as foreigners and, as traitors, many were
publicly executed. The perpetrators of this violence were not just
provoked by an incident, the torching of a train carriage and the
murder of its passengers. Their hatred was directed to a whole
body of people of a certain religion who they regarded as cultural
and social 'foreigners' to their understanding of 'India'. This was
a deep-rooted belief, sustained and developed by a reading of
history that validated the fissures amongst Indians and provoked
hatred and incredible violence. It led to widespread mistrust and
suspicion, sentiments that were not created by an 'event' but by a
series of public interventions wherein the characterization of the
past played an extremely important role. By contrasting Atal Bihari
Vajpayee's speech with the work of professional historians it is
hoped that the readers of this volume will never confuse political
rhetoric with history and at the same time comprehend the huge
power that history does possess to shape the destiny of the nation
today. It also means that we have to function more responsibly as
critical consumers of the past, an ongoing effort where I hope the
essays in this volume will prove helpful.
