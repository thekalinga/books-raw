Let us imagine a graceful bronze image of Dancing Siva before us. It
was perhaps created by a Cola artist in eleventh-century Tamilnadu
to be installed in a temple to receive offerings of worship, and to
parade around the town in a ceremonial palanquin on festival days.
From there, this image might have followed any of several paths to
stand before us now in a North American museum. Perhaps it was
buried under a banyan tree in late fourteenth century when invading
Islamic armies, feared for their iconoclasm, marched through the
Kaveri delta on their way to Madurai. It could have been disinterred
in the nineteenth century, during British rule, by a Tamil workman
on a road crew, who showed it to the civil engineer, who brought
it to the attention of the District Collector, who passed it on to the
Director of Archaeology. In the twentieth century, perhaps, when
an international market developed for such objects, it might have
ended up in an auction room, a cosmic dance sold to the highest
bidder. Or a government expert on culture might have selected it,
after its long hibernation in the basement storehouse of its temple, as
an image worthy to travel abroad as an ambassador of independent
India in the international diplomatics of traveling exhibitions.

All of us who attend to South Asian art realize that the "art
objects" we admire so much in the Museum of Art or at the Festival
of India are there, revealing themselves to us, as the result of a
series of disjunctive historical events and processes. Certainly, we
recognize that the nameless artists who produced these works were
not working with museum display as their goal. Yet here, finally,
they are.

Acts of appropriation, by which objects are removed from the
settings for which they were fabricated and placed in new ones,
are nothing new in South Asia. We would certainly be wrong to
picture Islamic iconoclasm or European commoditization, however
profound their impact, as impinging on a previously static Hindu,
where all such objects occupied and remained in their own fixed
places, recognized and respected by all. To the contrary, if we judge
from inscriptions, chronicles, and the objects themselves, certain
objects circulated widely and famously in early medieval India.

This essay will examine one phase in the circulation of Indian
art objects: the appropriation of sculpted images by medieval
Indian rulers as political acts. During this period, the worship of
divinized images in temples was the central public religious cult
of the subcontinent, and temple images were often closely tied
to the political order. In the prevailing ideological formations of
medieval India, worshipers of Vishnu, Śiva, or Durga considered
ruling authority to emanate from the lord of the cosmos downward
to the human lords of more limited domains such as empires,
kingdoms, territories, or villages. The construction of monumental
temples housing images of these divinities, making evident their
cosmic sovereignty within the polity of the sponsor, was a way
of representing and embodying political accomplishments while
locating such attainments within a larger, encompassing divine
order.

With divine images already preponderant participants in the
medieval system of authoritative relations, it is not surprising
that images were often seized publicly by one ruler from another
in circumstances of conflict. Alive to the identities and mythic
backgrounds of the figures, royal looters dislodged selected images
from their customary positions and employed them to articulate
political claims in a rhetoric of objects whose principal themes
were victory and defeat, autonomy and subjugation, dominance
and subordination. Such acts were undertaken in deadly earnest
and often had decisive effects for the human actors. For the images,
too, there were notable consequences. Captured by new proprietors,
relocated in new surroundings, their identities shifted significantly.
Here I wish to explore this medieval political discourse that utilized
religious images and its effect on the objects so used.

## The Appropriation of Images

When art historians of religion, and others who concern themselves
with Indian religious objects think about an image such as our
hypothetical Dancing Siva, we focus our attention most often on
the aesthetic elegance of its form, on the religious meaning of its
iconographic composition, or on the social and political context
within which it was fabricated. In these matters, we believe, lies the
essential significance of the object, the message the artist and other
agencies responsible for its composition intended to convey. The
subsequent life history of the object we tend to regard as extrinsic,
as somehow beside the point. It is as if meaning were fixed once
and for all at the moment of creation.

With these tacit assumptions, Indianists have seldom studied
the appropriation of art objects in premodern South Asia. The only
general treatment that I know of is _Royal Conquest and Cultural
Migrations in South India and the Deccan_ (1964), by the erudite
art historian C. Sivaramamurti. In his wide-ranging survey of the
relationship between military campaigns and the transmission of
artistic themes and motifs in classical and medieval South Asia,
Sivaramamurti paints a portrait of essentially benign artistic
exchanges among warring kings, motivated by spontaneous
aesthetic appreciation.

>Sometimes a great victor was struck with admiration and adopted what
were essential features of the culture of a dynasty long reduced to
dust with all its glory forgotten. Sometimes the politically vanquished
sovereign had something glorious to give as a lesson of culture to his
victor, who, it must be said to his credit, enthusiastically accepted it,
though it was really a cultural conquest of the political victor by the
vanquished. (Sivaramamurti 1964b)

Undoubtedly, many medieval South Asian kings did appreciate the
artistry of a finely rendered bronze or an elegant carved pillar, just as
they appreciated well-created poetry. As prescriptive texts indicate,
a young prince's education might well include instruction in the
various branches of art and architecture. Kings often participated
directly in the construction of religious edifices as ritual patrons,
and several substantial texts on the fabrication of temples and
images are attributed to royal authorship. However, kings did not
regard the appropriation of an image as primarily an expression
of aesthetic sensitivity, nor did they recognize the strong division
of "political" and "cultural" domains implicit in Sivaramamurti's
account. In almost all inscriptions and narrative accounts dealing
with the matter, expropriations are treated as predominantly political
acts. Such actions were not benign but were highly consequential,
not only for the development of art, but for the subsequent course
of political events as well.

To gain a preliminary idea of the value attached to image
appropriations, let us consider the case of the pure-gold Buddha
image of the Jewel Palace in Anuradhapura, seized by the Pandyans
in the ninth century and regained by the Sinhalese king Sena II.
The events are narrated by the Buddhist monk and chronicler
Dhammakitti in the _Calavamsa_ (_CV_) (Geiger 1925:115-36;
1929:138-60)./†

/†: All translations from Pali, Sanskrit, and Tamil in this essay are mine. I also
cite published translations where available.

In the early ninth century, the Pandyan kingdom of southern
Tamilnad expanded northward into the Kaveri and Kongu regions,
and sometime around 835 the Pandyan ruler Śrīmāra Śrīvallabha (r.
815-62), filled with imperial ambitions, mounted an invasion of the
island of Sri Lanka. The Sinhala king Sena I (r. 831-51) attempted
to resist, but the Pandyan attack proved too formidable.

>In an instant the great army of the Pandyan king swept over the large
crowd of Sinhala soldiers and crushed them, moving like Mära's army.
And the Sinhala king, hearing that his army had been sundered, took up
all his portable wealth and fled the city, heading towards the mountains.
(_CV_ 50.19-20)

With the Sinhalese army dispersed and leaderless, Śrīmāra (like
his namesake Mara, deadly to the Buddhists) easily captured the
capital and began to plunder it.

>He removed all the valuables from the royal treasury, and seized
everything that could be seized in the monastery and the city. The
statue of the Teacher made entirely of gold in the Jewel Palace, the pair
of jewels set as eyes in the Lord of Sages made of stone, likewise the
gold plate on the _caitya_ in the Thüpārāma, and the golden images in
the various monasteries --- all these he seized, denuding Lanka island of
its wealth and spitting out the once-splendid city as if demons (yakşas)
had devoured it. (_CV_ 50.33-36)

The solid gold Buddha was not an ancient image. It had been made
about fifty years earlier, sponsored by King Mahinda II (r. 772-92) at the steep cost of 60,000 copper coins, and established on a
pedestal in the Jewel Palace, a pavilion constructed by Mahinda
in the Abhayagiri monastic complex (_CV_ 48.136-37). Mahinda's
grandson, Aggabodhi VIII (r. 801-12), honored the image with a
grand festival as part of his accession to kingship (_CV_ 49.44). The
sumptuous image was evidently one of considerable importance
not only to the Abhayagiri monks who maintained it but also to the
Sinhalese rulers of the period.

Back on the mainland, the Pallavas were organizing a coalition
of forces to oppose the upstart Pandyans, and this undoubtedly made
Śrīmāra more eager to come to terms with his defeated opponent.
From exile, Sena I was able to negotiate a settlement with the
occupying power, giving elephants and all his jewels to Śrīmāra.
The Pandyan king left the island with his booty and tribute. Sena
I returned to the capital and took up sovereignty once again, but
sovereignty of a decidedly diminished stature.

When Sena I died, his nephew, Sena II (r. 851-85), became ruler.
The new king ruled without incident, Dhammakitti relates, until
the day he held a festival for the Tooth-relic:

>Once when the king was celebrating the great festival of the Tooth-relic
>with all proper offerings, he ascended the excellent Jewel Palace, and
>there saw the empty pedestal where the golden Buddha had once stood.
>"Why is this?" he asked.
>
>"Does the king not know?" replied the ministers. "During the time of
>your uncle, King Sena, my lord, the Pandyan king came here, laid waste
>to the island, and left, taking all that had become valuable to us."
>
>When the king heard this, he was ashamed as if it were he himself
>who had been defeated. And that very day he ordered the ministers to
>assemble his troops. (_CV_ 51.22-26)

A disgruntled Pandyan prince, apparently a passed-over claimant
to the throne, had conveniently appeared in Lanka requesting aid,
and Sena II saw in him an opportunity to redress his grievance. The
Sinhala king sent an expeditionary force to accompany the prince
and support his claim to rule in Madurai, the Pandyan capital. "Go!"
he ordered his commander, Kuṭṭaka, "Kill the Pandyan king! Bring
back all the jewels he once took from here! Grant sovereignty to
this prince, and return quickly!" (_CV_ 51.30-31).

Meanwhile, the Pandyan armies had been engaged with the
Pallava-led coalition, fighting three costly battles. When the
Sinhalese armies attacked from the other flank and marched on
Madurai, the Pandyans were unable to resist. Śrīmāra died shortly
after of wounds sustained in battle.

>Then the Sinhalese armies fearlessly entered the city and plundered
the place completely, like gods sacking the city of the demons. The
commander inspected the treasury in the royal place, and took all the
valuables that had been taken from our island, as well as those found
in the town and the countryside. (_CV_ 51.39-41).

A good patriot, Dhammakitti compares pillage done by others to
the work of Mara's army and demons; when it is done by his own
countrymen, however, it is as if gods plundered demons.

Kuttaka had the Pandyan prince crowned as King Varagunavarman
II and, after a brief tour, returned to Lanka, where Sena II received
the victorious army with rejoicing and rituals of solidarity. The
king held a great feast for them in the capital, celebrated a festival
of victory, and distributed gifts to the poor. The repatriated objects
he conscientiously restored to their proper places.

>Without attachment he placed all the valuables in their original places
on the island, and he ritually established the golden images just as they
had been before. He filled the empty pedestal of the Teacher in the
Jewel Palace, and he secured the land by setting up guardposts. (_CV_
51.48-49)

The restoration of images had remarkable effects on the community,
for from that time on Lanka became as prosperous as Uttarakuru,
the legendary land of plenty beyond the Himalaya.

In this simple moral tale of treasure lost and recaptured, we
begin to see more clearly how medieval kings and their advisers
regarded the expropriation of images. The stolen image, disclosed
to the young king by its empty pedestal, serves as an objectification
of defeat not only for his uncle, who had suffered the loss, but for
the very institution of Sinhala sovereignty. The humiliation that
the king feels and his immediate resolve to retrieve the golden
Buddha indicate how powerfully the empty pedestal provoked him,
how clearly he understood its message in this discourse of objects.
His orders to Kuṭṭaka and the commander's careful search in the
royal treasury at Madurai confirm that recovery of the missing
images was a central purpose of the invasion, and the jubilation
upon their successful return is in the narrator's eyes a celebration
of the restoration of the country's wholeness. For Dhammakitti,
whose principal concern throughout the cũlavamsa is to delineate
proper relations between Sinhalese sovereignty and the Buddhist
community, loss and recovery of the golden Buddha is a synecdoche
for the integrity of the Sinhalese polity itself.

## Loot: Morality and Motivation

In their inscriptions, medieval Indian rulers proudly and repeatedly
proclaim their expropriation of objects from other kings. Here, for
instance, is the epigraphic account of a Cola king's victory over a
Calukya opponent at the battle of Katalcankamam:

>Virarajendra halted his hot, impetuous elephant and donned the garland
of victory. He plucked out his opponent's wives, the family treasure,
his conches, his fringed white parasol, his trumpets, his war-drum, his
canopy, his white yak-tail fans, the banner of the boar, the crocodile
gateway, "Blossom" the female elephant, a herd of war-elephants, and a
troop of prancing horses. Amidst shouts of praise, he put on the victory
crown adorned with splendid red jewels. (Hultzsch 1899a:34)

Not only does Virarajendra (1063-69) "pluck" his defeated enemy
of these properties, he also places them on display in the capital
for his subjects to view:

>Seated on a throne of bright jewels, Virarajendra exhibited in orderly
rows the great heaps of treasures he had seized in the Vengi territory,
while all the kings on earth did homage at his feet and praised him.
(Hultzsch 1899b:67)

There is nothing furtive about all this. Just as the subordinate rulers
bowing at Virarajendra's feet visibly signify their acceptance of his
overlordship, the orderly exhibition of Calukyan treasures is meant
to represent objectively to all observers Vīrarajendra's battlefield
victory. Looting in medieval South Asia, was an important element
in the rhetoric of kingship.

The forcible expropriation of valued objects from an other
defined as an enemy in circumstances of military conflict, which
we designate by the Anglo-Indian term "looting," is a longstanding
practice in many cultures, of course (Yule and Burnell 1903:519- 20).
However, this activity may be constructed and construed
differently in different times and places. We in the modern West
have come to regard looting as a species of theft, a side effect of war
that is predatory, disorganized, and motivated by economic gain.

Indians of the medieval period, by contrast, did not consider such
seizure as theft, nor did they necessarily conduct it in a disorderly
and surreptitious fashion. As the inscriptions of Virarajendra
suggest, medieval South Asian rulers and their retinues carried
out plunder as a normal and public aspect of war, organized by
and around the person of the king, and directed as much toward
symbolic objects as toward economic resources. To consider more
closely the cultural construction of such wartime appropriations, let
us begin with the _dharmasastra_ of Manu (_MS_) and his ninth-century
Kashmiri commentator Medhätithi (_MSBh_) (Jolly 1887; Buhler
\[1886\] 1984; Kevalananda and Gharpure 1958; Jha 1920-26).

In his discussion of proper royal conduct, Manu is concerned
to circumscribe battlefield behavior within a code of chivalrous
conduct. Manu sets down prescriptions concerning whom a warrior
may strike, when he may strike him, what weapons he may use,
and much more. While urging discipline upon the troops in many
respects, Manu indicates no similar compunction about the propriety
of plunder.

>Chariots, horses, parasols, money, grain, cattle, women, all kinds of
goods, and base metals all belong to the one who wins (_jayati_) them.
(_MS_ 7.96)

It is a matter of "victory," not of theft.

The moral question for Manu is not whether one may expropriate
objects (and living property as well) from defeated opponents, but
how one should properly distribute the booty. Certain valuable
commodities, such as gold, silver, and land are reserved for the king
alone, Medhatithi tells us. This includes, as we will see, all regalia
and images. It is impermissible, however, for the king as master
(_svämin_) to appropriate all loot for himself. Other items --- those
listed in Manu's verse --- belong to the individual warriors who
acquire them. But here, too, a portion (and, Medhatithi specifies,
the best portion) must be presented to the king: "One should give
a share to the king. So it is stated in the Veda" (_MS_ 7.97). The king
occupies the center of all looting transactions. Sharing the spoils
reiterates substantively the moral relationship between king and
troops.

The Vedic precedent to which Manu refers is none other than the
primordial battle between Indra, king of the gods, and the demon
Vrtra. When Indra defeated the demon in combat and so became
great, he requested and received best portion of all the loot obtained
(_Aitareyabrāhmaṇa_ 3.21; Keith 1920:178). As Indra among the
gods, so, too, the king among his subordinates is entitled to the
choice part of every expropriation. By sharing loot hierarchically,
Manu suggests, Hindu rulers should attempt to replicate in human
society the model set by the Vedic gods.

Medhatithi records an additional provision concerning spoils
gained by the king himself and those acquired by the army as a
collectivity. Of such loot, he tells us, "the king should distribute it
among those he supports according to the principle of 'bestowing
acquisitions on a worthy recipient" (_MSBh_ 7.97). This principle,
Medhatithi explains elsewhere, means that a king should apportion
out his acquisitions to such "worthy recipients" as gods, hermitages,
intellectuals, moral exemplars, and others of that ilk. He also may
employ his resources in sponsoring public festivals (_MSBh_ 7.56).
By that same principle, we often learn through inscriptions of looted
objects presented to temple deities and to those who served the
king in battle. Booty engenders those substantive transactions that
link the king both with the god or gods whose cosmic sovereignty
includes and surpasses his own and also with eminent subjects
within his own dominion.

Far from eschewing wartime appropriations, then, medieval
Hindu rulers place themselves forthrightly in the center of a
redistributive network involving expropriated objects. Not
surprisingly, this is closely linked to the medieval Hindu ideology
of royal authority, which views the king as the central agency
responsible for integrating the dispersed segments of his domain
into a unitary polity and bringing about its prosperity. By seizing
objects during military campaigns, he embodies the victory he has
attained over his rivals, symbolically incorporating their signs,
and by reapportioning those objects within his own domain, he
replenishes it and reiterates the ties that bind together the dominion
of which he is the moral center.

## Appropriated Images and Secondary Signs

The appropriation of Indian images recasts their significance
without altering what they are and fundamentally represent. To
clarify this point, it is useful to keep in mind Roland Barthes' well-
known model of mythology as a second-order semiological system
(1957:111-17). Here, the first-order sign system consists not of
language but of physical objects --- in most cases, sculpted objects
that represent something according to known conventions and
also may serve as the embodiment of that something. The golden
Buddha image, as signifier, evokes immediately in its viewers the
concept of "Buddha-as-Teacher," the signified. Their associative
unity, drawn even more closely when the Buddha is ritually invoked
into the image, constitutes the sign. It is this first-order pairing of
image and signified concept (or divinity) that we refer to when we
"identify" an Indian image iconographically. When seized by the
Pandyan king, however, the signification of the golden Buddha
shifts, as Barthes would have it, sideways. The appropriated image
in its new situation now serves as the signifier also of the military
victory of the Pandyan ruler over the Sinhalese. It has not lost its
previous identity, but a secondary signification augments it.

This enhancement of identity may be asserted explicitly, as
in the case of a Calukyan door-guardian looted by the Cola king
Rājādhiraja (r. 1018-54), where details of its origin and seizure have
been inscribed onto the object itself: "This is the door-guardian
brought by Lord Vijayarajendradeva after burning Kalyanapuram."
The source of the looted image may become a permanent part
of its name. The "Vatapi Ganapati" at Tiruccenkāṭṭānkuţi, for
instance, denotes the image of Ganesa brought to Tamilnad by
the Pallava ruler Narasimhavarman I (r. 630-68), after sacking
the Calukyan capital of Vatäpi in 642 C.E. (Balasubrahmanyam
1975:96-102). Images may even carry with them entire pedigrees
of previous proprietors and appropriators. In the Lakṣmaṇa temple
of Khajuraho (illustration 1), constructed by the Candella ruler
Yasovarman shortly before 950 C.E. to house a solid-gold image of
Vişņu Vaikuntha, the foundation inscription traces the background
of the image:

>The lord of the Tibetans got it from Mount Kailasa, and then Sahi the
king of Kangrā received it from him out of friendship. With his troops
of elephants and horses, Herambapāla (Pratihāra) thereupon seized it
from him. Obtaining it from his son, the (Pratihära) prince Devapāla, the
illustrious (Candella) king Yasovarman --- an ornament among kings and
a crusher of enemies --- performed the ritual establishment of Vaikuntha.
(Keilhorn 1892:129)

From "Kailasa" (Kashmir?) to Tibet to Kangrā to Kanyakubja to
Khajuraho: these past journeys of this eminent Vişņu image are
carefully recorded as indicative and constitutive of its identity and
value.

Appropriated images are, nevertheless, still also divine images.
The object may be removed from its original and intended
situation, but this does not empty it of its previous significance as
a fabricated icon that may, under proper ritual conditions, serve as
an embodiment for a god or goddess. Looted images are, therefore,
worthy of respectful treatment from their new proprietors, and for
the most part during this period they did receive it. We do not hear
of the intentional defilement of divine images nor, very often, of
their public mutilation by those who seize them.

Often the looters made considerable effort to erect new
temples for housing plundered images in the manner that befitted
their significance. One of the most notable practitioners of royal
appropriation was the Vijayanagar emperor Kṛṣṇadevarāya (r.
1509-29). Shortly after assuming the throne, the emperor attacked
the forces of the Gajapati ruler Prataparudra at Udayagiri, a hill
stronghold in Andhra Pradesh. After a bitter siege lasting some
eighteen months, the fortress fell, paving the way for further
victories over the Gajapatis and leading finally to Prataparudra's
acceptance of Vijayanagar suzerainty.

The victory at Udayagiri was celebrated as a momentous event,
and as part of the celebrations Kṛṣṇadevaraya had transported
back to his capital an image of Balakṛṣṇa from a small temple at
Udayagiri (Krishna Sastri 1912:164-200). It was a modest figure,
just over three feet tall with its pedestal. Carved in the greenish
black granite typical of the Udayagiri area, it portrayed Kṛṣṇa as a
chubby boy seated with his right foot on a lotus flower and holding
a butter-ball (illustration 2). To house the looted image, the emperor
had specially constructed the Krşpasvămi temple, resembling in
plan and design the Udayagiri temple from which the image had
been removed. At its consecration ceremony, the king presented
gold and silver vessels to the Udayagiri Balakṛṣṇa and endowed
it with the royal share from nine villages for maintaining regular
daily worship on a suitable scale (Krishna Sastri 1923:44-50).
Vyasarāya, a favored intellectual of the royal court, composed a
series of hymns to honor the advent of this image in Vijayanagar
(Nilakanta Sastri and Venkataramanayya 1946:1.203). Evidently,
Balakṛṣṇa was treated as a valued and honored guest by his new
dynastic hosts.

There is good reason to suppose that another Vijayanagar
monument of Kṛṣṇadevaraya's time, the Vitthalasvāmi temple,
also housed a looted image. Vitthala is a form of Vişņu-Kṛṣṇa
worshipped almost exclusively in Maharashtra, and his cult is
centered at Pandharpur. In 1520 and 1521, Kṛṣṇadevaraya led a
successful campaign against 'Adilshah, Sultan of Bijapur, bringing
him temporary control over the Pandharpur area. Considerable
evidence suggests that the Vijayanagar ruler took the image of
Vitthala from its cult center and brought it back to the capital to
animate his own Vitthala temple, which was then under construction
(Khare 1936).

For Kṛṣṇadevaraya, the appropriation of such images does
not appear to have been simply a matter of personal religious
predilection or of offering refuge from the threat of Islamic
iconoclasm to gods of other regions (Longhurst 1916-17:27;
Krishnasvami Aiyangar 1936:20-21). Rather, I would argue, it
was part of a ritually incorporative imperial policy, requiring the
conspicuous, ceremonial presence of subordinated polities in the
capital. As Burton Stein has argued, during Navaratri, the principal
royal festival of Vijayanagar, the feudatory "chiefs" were obliged to
participate in a series of hierarchicized transactions with their
overlord, enacting and reconstituting annually their subordinate
share in Vijayanagar sovereignty (Stein 1983). Divinities of the
subject regions likewise made yearly treks to attend the ceremonies,
along with retinues of priests and temple dancers, who arrived in
great "triumphal cars." While the human servants of these divinities
made obeisance to the Vijayanagar emperor and danced for him,
the images themselves expressed homage to the presiding deity of
the festival, an image of the goddess Durga, slayer of the Buffalo-
demon.

The more permanent presence of the Udayagiri Balakṛṣṇa in
Vijayanagar conveyed much the same message as the visiting
deities of Navaratri. Transported to the capital and housed in its
own temple, it spoke, not only of the glorious childhood of Kṛṣṇa,
who received the homage of Kṛṣṇadevaraya and his retinue, but
also of the encompassing of Gajapati polity within the overarching
imperial lordship of the Vijayanagar sovereign.

## Homologies for Defeated Kings

Barthes' model of a second-order semiological system may also
help account for the choice of particular objects or images as loot.
The most common target for royal appropriation in medieval
India, according to inscriptions, was regalia, a repertoire of objects
closely associated with the king's person and his capacity to rule
--- banners, yak-tail fans, umbrellas, crowns, thrones, scepters,
musical instruments, and gateways. With such synecdochic
objects, the choice was rather simple. Since they were clearly and
unequivocally associated with the king through an ongoing series
of royal ceremonials, they presented obvious targets for seizure.

But divine images are more complex objects than other items
of regalia, and similarly, the semiotic value of their appropriation
was more complicated.

One might expect (as I initially did) that a conquering king
would direct himself toward the most important images of a defeated
kingdom. What more powerful way to proclaim dominance than
to appropriate the preeminent deity of the vanquished. There are
certainly cases where this expectation is borne out, such as the
seizure of the Sinhalese Golden Buddha by the Pandyans. Not only
was this image closely associated with Sinhalese royalty, but it also
acted as an apt signifier for a polity that strongly supported the
Buddhist Sangha as the primary religious group in its domain.

Just as often, however, this does not happen. Consider, for
example, the perplexing choice of a stone door-guardian from
Kalyānī as a target for appropriation by the Cola king Rajadhirāja./**
In 1045, Rajadhiraja waged war against his Calukya foes led by
Someśvara I (r. 1042-68), routed the enemy forces at the battle of
Puntür, forced Someśvara to flee, and then continued north to burn
the Calukya capital of Kalyani. To add ritual insult to injury, he there
performed a Heroic Consecration ceremony and assumed the new
royal title of Vijayarajendra, the Victorious Rajendra. Returning
from this successful campaign, Rajadhiraja transported a massive
black stone door-guardian nearly 500 miles to his own capital of
Gangaikoṇḍacolapuram, where he displayed it as a trophy of war
and had it incised with an identifying inscription stating that he had
seized it when burning the Calukya capital (Illustration 3).

Now, if Rajadhiraja plundered and burned Kalyāṇī, he
presumably had his pick of a great number of Calukya images. He
could perhaps have taken an image of Vişnu in his Boar incarnation,
which was the particular insignia of the Calukya dynasty. To save
Earth from sinking into the ocean, Vişņu had once embodied himself
as a powerful Boar, dove into the depths, and raised Earth on his
giant snout. The Calukyas, emulating the earlier Gupta dynasty,
adopted this form of Vişņu for special attention, seeking to re-enact
the Boar's mythical deed through their own Earth-saving dynastic
mission. Yet Rajadhiraja contented himself with an image of clearly
inferior status within the temple hierarchy. Door-guardians were
divine henchmen, stationed at the entrances of temples, whose
business it was to prevent demons and enemies from approaching
the inner sanctum and to pay homage to the supreme lord within,
thereby enacting and displaying their own subordinate position.

/**: A more complete discussion of this case of appropriation, touching on many
of the themes of this essay, may be found in Richard Davis, "Trophies of War:
The Case of the Calukya Intruder," in _Perceptions of India's Visual Past_, eds.
Catherine Asher and Thomas Metcalf (Delhi: American Institute of Indian
Studies, 1994).

To comprehend Rajadhiraja's choice, it is first necessary to
recognize that it alluded to a historical precedent, Dantidurga's
famous "Golden Womb" (_hiranyagarbha_) ceremony at Ujjain.
The first autonomous ruler of the Raştraküţa dynasty, Dantidurga
(r. c. 742-56) gained independence from Lalitäditya of Kashmir
and commenced a "conquest of the directions" (_digvijaya_), which
brought him into conflict with the Gurjara-Pratihāra king, Nagabhata
I, who ruled over the Malwa region. Dantidurga was victorious in
the ensuing battle. He occupied the Gurjara capital, Ujjain, and there
performed a royal gift-giving ceremony, the Golden Womb ritual.
As one inscription relates it, "When he directed warriors to perform
the Golden Womb ceremony in Ujjain, Dantidurga made the
Gurjara ruler and other kings serve as his door-keepers (_Pratihāra_)"
(Bhandarkar 1925-26:243). Clearly, the Răstrakūta king was here
making a powerful ritual statement of political subjugation, forcing
a defeated opponent to act in a lowly capacity in a royal Gift-giving
ceremony, in his own capital to boot. Subsequently, Dantidurga went
on to defeat the Calukyas of Vatäpi (from whom the later Calukyas
of Kalyāṇī claimed descent), and the Rāṣṭrakūtas replaced them for
the next two centuries as the pre-eminent power of the Deccan.

The Cola kings of the eleventh century were acutely aware of
the Rāṣṭrakūtas. For one thing, the Rāṣṭrakūtas had in the mid-tenth
century dealt the Colas a humiliating defeat at the battle of Takkolam
and had occupied Cola territory for several decades thereafter.
More important, the Rāṣṭrakūtas had been for almost two centuries
the "supreme overlords" of the subcontinent, and the Cola kings
Rājarāja I and Rajendra I --- Rājādhiraja's grandfather and father,
respectively ---aspired to supersede them as the major imperial
power of India. After two victorious "conquests of the directions,"
they had largely accomplished this. As a culmination of the Cola
rise to pre-eminence, Rajendra mounted a grand northern progress
to the Ganges River, which he had possessed and transported to
his own new capital --- all of this replicating an earlier raid on the
Ganges perpetrated by the Răştrakūtas. (I will discuss the seizing
of Ganga below.)

Institute of Indian Studies).

So, too, Rajadhiraja looked to Raştrakūta precedents in his
political rhetoric. His appropriation of a door-guardian from the
later Călukyas re-enacted Dantidurga's ritual demotion of the
Gurjara king during the Golden Womb ceremony in a less personal
and less compelling but more permanent manner. Mimicking the
earlier conqueror of the Calukyas, Rajadhiraja also performed
a royal ritual in the capital of the defeated king --- in this case,
Heroic Consecration. Unable to force his rival to take on the
role of ceremonial doorkeeper in person, since Someśvara had
successfully fled, Rajadhiraja seized a stone door-guardian instead
and transported it back to the Cola country.

The parallelism of door-guardian and Calukya king went further
still: both had failed in their primary responsibility. The hapless
door-guardian had been unable to stop the destruction of its temple,
and likewise Someśvara had failed to prevent the Cola armies
from entering and destroying his capital. Waiting in attendance at
the Cola capital, the looted Calukya door-guardian could act as a
permanent visible homologue of the subjugated Calukya ruler. It
was a taunting display, to be sure, and, not surprisingly, Someśvara
returned from exile to avenge his humiliation by killing Rajadhiraja
at the battle of Koppam.

## Redistribution: The Emerald Pedestal

Not only does the seizing of objects from opponents in war convey
political messages, so, too, does the subsequent redistributing
of those objects. If an image forcibly taken from an unwilling
opponent and repositioned in one's capital can serve as a figurative
incorporation of that opponent's polity, then by the same token an
image accepted willingly by a subordinate ruler from his overlord
may signify a subjugation voluntarily accepted. The operative
principle in such cases is Manu's phrase, "bestowing acquisitions
on worthy recipients."

Within the system of loot-distribution described by Manu and
Medhatithi, as we have seen, all important appropriated objects
reverted to the king, who then "bestowed" them as warranted.
The "worthy recipient" that he chose to favor might be, first and
foremost, the god he worshiped as his own lord. So when the
Kalacuri king Lakṣmaṇarāja II, ruling in the Dahala region of
Madhya Pradesh, undertook in the tenth century a western military
campaign, he pointedly made a pilgrimage to the famous Saiva
temple of Somanātha on the Gujarat coast and there "presented in
reverence to Śiva an image Kaliya \[presumably Kaliyavadha Kṛṣṇa\]
made of jewels and gold," which he had taken in an earlier battle
with the king of Orissa on the coast (Mirashi 1995:213-14).

Alternatively, a king might choose human subordinates as
worthy recipients for looted images, not as an act of devotion to
a superior but as one favor or grace to an inferior. To consider the
political semantics of such a gift, let us take the case of an "Emerald
Pedestal" (_marakatapītām_) employed as a central ritual object in
an impressive performance of Navaratri in Ramanathapuram in
the year 1892 (Sivasankara Pandiyaji n.d.; Breckenridge 1977).
The pedestal was a looted object. According to local tradition, it
had been acquired in the mid-seventeenth century by the Setupati
Raghunatha Tevar, an ancestor of H.H. Raja Bhaskaraswamy
Avargal, the Setupati sponsoring the 1892 celebrations.

At the time of its acquisition, the Madurai Nayakkar ("governor")
Tirumalai (r. 1623-59) was ruling over southern Tamilnad,
virtually autonomous from the fading Vijayanagar imperium that
had established the Nayakkar rule in Madurai a century earlier.
Raghunatha Tevar, the Setupati of Ramnad, was his subordinate.
During Tirumalai's reign, the southern kingdoms of Madurai and
Mysore had fought a series of inconclusive battles, and in 1656, with
the aged Tirumalai sick in bed, the Mysore ruler Kanthīrava Narasa
attacked once again. Apparently, the Mysore forces penetrated all
the way to Madurai, and Tirumalai's only recourse was to call on
his royal subordinate. The Madurai chronicles narrate it this way:

>Now the king Tirumalai Nayakkar wrote and sent a letter to the Setupati.
>On the very day the Setupati read the letter, he immediately prepared
>60,000 men and brought them. He defeated the Mysore army, drove it
>into the Ghats, attained victory, and returned to the king.
>
>The king was very happy, and held a feast for him in the palace. He
>presented him with many elephants and horses, clothing, ornaments, and
>the like, and he gave him the title "Tirumalai's Setupati." He also gave
>the Setupati his own Lion faced Palanquin and other emblems such as
>a banner and a canopy. Calling him a son of his own lineage, Tirumalai
>dismissed all revenue assessments, saying that he no longer had to pay
>tribute. And from that time on, the Setupati ruled his territory without
>paying tribute, and he had the Ramanathapuram fort rebuilt as a stone
>fortress. (Taylor 1853:2.26)

The transactions between the Ramnad Setupati and the Madurai
Nayakkar described here reflect a characteristic medieval South
Indian patterning of authoritative relations by which ruling
kings "shared" their sovereignty with lesser kings, who thereby
became subordinate participants within the overarching system.
In his recent ethnohistory of this political formation, Nicholas
Dirks (1987) points to the Vijayanagar ceremony of Navaratri as
the dramatic ritual paradigm of the system in action. During the
nine-day ceremony, the Vijayanagar emperor at the center of the
festival expressed his homage to an image of the goddess Durgă, the
presiding deity of the festival, and received from her his authority to
rule in the objective form of royal sword and scepter. In her defining
mythic action, Durga had herself received weapons from all the
gods to aid her in killing the demon that none but she could defeat.
The subordinate governors, Nayakkars, who where compelled to
be present in the capital, would in turn express their devotion to
the emperor and receive from him portions of his authority in the
physical form of emblems.

>The sharing of the king's sovereignty through the transactions of
the festival had the effect of incorporating the disparate elements of
the kingdom into his sovereign being and rendering them all parts
--- metonyms --- of himself, even as the emblems were themselves
metonyms of his sovereignty. (Dirks 1987:42)

This personalized and embodied authority was passed down from
level to level, from emperor to governor to subordinate chieftain
and so on, through similar ceremonial exchanges.

The primary currency of this hierarchized transactional system,
Dirks tells us, were "services" and "honors": the subordinate offering
service to his superior, the superior in turn granting honors of various
sorts to the subordinate. So the Ramnad Setupati unhesitatingly
offered his military service and troops to the beleaguered Madurai
Nayakkar, saving Tirumalai from defeat and attaining victory over
the Mysore invaders on behalf of his overlord. The Emerald Pedestal
presumably was part of the substantive "victory" that Raghunatha
acquired during the campaign and presented to his lord. Tirumalai
in turn recognized Raghunatha's service with a host of honors:
gifts, titles, emblems, and rights to the unfettered enjoyment of
land. These royal gifts were, in fact, gifts also of limited, shared
sovereignty within Tirumalai's encompassing dominion.

In this light, it is not difficult to see why Tirumalai chose the
looted pedestal as a suitable object to bestow upon his worthy
recipient. During an earlier campaign on behalf of the Madurai
ruler, Raghunatha had helped a Muslim invasion led by "Khub
Khan" and had been honored with the title, "He who propped up
the kingdom" (Nelson 1868:3.138). As a subordinate ruler and
warrior, the Setupati certainly had acted as a prop to the Nayakkar's
rule, and so the identity of the plundered object once again refers
to a political relationship. The Emerald Pedestal was a homologue
not for an involuntarily subjugated source but for a willingly
subordinate recipient.

## The Gift of Submission

In one final variation on this general trope, an image might be
given as a token of submission, a metonymic acceptance of ritual
subordination, to forestall an actual invasion and a more forcible
incorporation. Our example here concerns the Răstrakūtas and
Sinhalese.

In the early part of the ninth century, the Rastraküta king
Govinda III (r. c. 790-815) undertook two southern expeditions,
during which he decisively defeated the most potent southern
kingdom, the Pallavas of Kañcipuram, and occupied their capital.
Other kingdoms of the south came under direct threat from this
most powerful Indian empire, and the frightened Sri Lankan king
Aggabodhi VIII, ruling in Anuradhapuram, did what he could
to fend off a direct attack: he sent two images to Govinda. As a
Răştrakūta inscription reports:

>Just as if he had forcibly subdued the self-centered \[Lankan\] king and
his indolent chief minister with his own scepter and brought them deaf
and dumb to the City of Delight, while in Kanci Govinda received from
Lanka two images of their lord (_prabhu_) and then set them up in a Saiva
temple here \[in Mänyakheta, the Raştrakūta capital\], like two pillars of
his fame. (Bhandarkar 1925-26:246)

The epigraphical simile makes it clear that these images were to be
regarded as "deaf and dumb" representatives of a Sinhala polity that
had, by this very gift, accepted the overlordship of the Răstrakūtas.
For Govinda III, more concerned with pillars of fame and ritual
hegemony than the acquisition of territory, this was sufficient. The
enforced diplomatic offering of images did dissuade the Răştrakūtas
from invading the island, but only at the expense of incorporating
Lanka metonymically into the Răstrakūta imperial formation.

What exactly were the images that the Sinhalese king sent to
Govinda? Various possibilities have been suggested: statues of the
demon Rāvaņa as "the most ancient and traditional ruler" of Lanka,
or perhaps likenesses of the king and chief minister themselves
(Bhandarkar 1925-26:241; Altekar 1934:69). In light of the general
rhetoric we have investigated in this paper, it seems much more
likely that Aggabodhi sent two images of the Buddha, as his own
personal lord and the highest lord of the Sinhala polity. (Aggabodhi,
we may recall, celebrated his royal consecration by honoring
the solid-gold Buddha of the Jewel Pavilion.) It is possible, too,
that the similitude of image and ruler had been drawn even more
closely by casting the Buddha image according to the proportions
of the king, a Sinhala practice of "reign-images" that has been
documented for the tenth century if not earlier (Wickremasinghe
1912:213-29; Gunawardana 1979:175). Even without this close
visual resemblance, though, none of the agents involved would
have misread the clear statement of Sinhala subordination in the two
Buddha images displayed "like pillars of fame" in a Saiva temple
of the Raştraküţa capital.

## Imperial Sovereignty: The Capture of Rivers

The appropriations and relocations of the art objects considered
so far speak primarily of personalized relations of dominance and
subordination among rulers and of the incorporation of particular
kingdoms into other polities. But other targets of appropriation
make more far-reaching assertions./§ Consider the inscriptional
claims of Vinayaditya, ruler of the Calukyas of Vatapi in the late
seventh century.

The Calukyas at this time were the dominant power of the
Deccan and had battled repeatedly with the Pallavas of Kanci
for control of southern India. Taking advantage of a period of
dynastic confusion in North India following the death of Harşa
in 647, Vinayāditya and his son, the crown prince Vijayāditya,
undertook a northern campaign in about 690, where they were
successful against a series of unnamed foes. They returned to the
Deccan with great spoils, including a series of significant symbolic
objects: the _pālī_-banner, the _daḍhakka_ drum, the "great sounds"
(_mahāśabda_, probably conches), and the two rivers, "Ganga and
Yamunā." Gaining these, inscriptions tell us, Vinayāditya possessed
"all the insignia (cihna) of highest overlordship (_paramaiśvarya_),
beginning with the powerful _pālī_-banner, which he had acquired
by defeating all the lords of the northern regions" (Pathak 1907-
8:202). They were passed on to Vijayaditya (r. 696-733) when
he assumed the Calukya throne, and he also came to possess
"sovereignty illuminated by insignia such as the _pālī_-banner that
cause the manifestation of complete overlordship" (Pathak 1909-
10:16). The Calukya inscriptions portray this particular bundle of
loot not merely as the regalia or second-order signifier of a single
enemy ruler but as the embodiment or representation of "universal
sovereignty," imperial lordship of the highest order.

/§: The recent work of Ronald Inden is particularly pertinent to this section. See,
especially, his discussion of the Răstrakūta imperial formation (Inden 1990:228-
62).

Evidently, we have here some extraordinary imperial objects.
The _pālī_-banner (or, literally, "flags in rows"), singled out in
Calukya inscriptions as the insignia par excellence, seems to have
been a particular arrangement of banners, in which a central flagstaff
with the Calukya insignia, Vişnu's Boar incarnation, on top was
surrounded by rows of flags bearing insignia of all other dynasties
in lower and peripheral position (Chidanandamurthy 1973:85-88).
It was thus, as Ronald Inden points out, an indexical sign of the
Calukya's claim to the highest degree of sovereignty, encompassing
and surpassing all other rulers of India (Inden 1990:250-52).

The most curious and intriguing items in this set of transportable
objects, however, are the two rivers, Ganga and Yamunā. The
Ganga may shift course gradually over the years, but how could
the Calukya king, ruling some 800 miles to the south of the river,
claim to "take" Ganga? What exactly did he appropriate? Ganga
and Yamunā are not just rivers but also goddesses whose images
often adorn the entrances of North India temples. Is that perhaps
what Vinayaditya seized?

The Calukyas, it turns out, were not the only southerners to
obtain Ganga and Yamuna. Within sixty years of Vinayaditya's
northern expedition, the Răstrakūtas had supplanted the Calukyas
as the dominant power of the Deccan and acquired the authoritative
_pālī_-banner, replacing the Calukyan Boar on top with their own
insignia, Vişnu's mount, Garuda. Around 800, the Răştrakūta king
Govinda III also made an expedition into North India, directed
against the Gurjara and Pala kings, who were then battling for
control of the Doab and the imperial city of Kanyakubja. He
defeated the Gurjara king Nagabhata II, then marched farther north,
where the Pala king Dharmapala and his Kanyakubja protégé,
Cakrayudha, also deferred to the royal Raştrakūta progress. During
this campaign, the inscriptions say, Govinda "took from his enemies
the Ganga and Yamuna, made beautiful by their waves, and acquired
at the same moment that supreme lordship of which they are a
visible sign" (Fleet 1883:156-65). Once again, acquisition of the
two northern rivers was epigraphically linked with the attainment
of imperial sovereignty.

Two hundred years after that, when the Răstrakūtas were no
more and the Colas were the dominant power of peninsular India,
the Cola emperor Rajendra I sent an army from Tamilnad north to
capture the Ganges. Though well aware of the historical precedents
for such an expedition, Rajendra instead chose to have himself
compared with the mythical ascetic who also had altered the course
of the Ganges.

>Mocking the great sage Bhagiratha, who had brought the Gangă to
earth through the power of his austerities, this light of the Solar lineage
decided to purify his own domain with the Ganga waters, brought there
by the strength of his arms. (Krishna Sastri 1920:400)

The Cola army made its way north, engaging and defeating a variety
of opponents until they finally reached the banks of the holy river.
From there, golden pots of Ganga water were transported south,
according to inscriptional accounts, carried atop the heads of kings
defeated along the way (Krishna Sastri 1984:74).

A pattern is clear. Three major peninsular dynasties of the early
medieval period, each in its time the most powerful kingdom in
the subcontinent, mounted military forays into the Gangetic plain,
won skirmishes with whatever powers they encountered there,
and claimed to have brought back to their own domains Ganga
and Yamună in some sort of visible, substantive form. Moreover,
none of them made any attempt in these raids to capture or retain
territory in the Gangetic plain. Raştrakūta accounts admit this quite
explicitly.

>In battles Govinda seized the noble, unshakable fame of the kings
Nagabhata and Candragupta, and then ---holding the acquisition of
fame as his highest aim --- he plucked out the remaining kings, now
deprived of support, from their own lands as if he were picking grains
of rice, and reinstated them again in their very own places. (Bhandarkar
1925-26:245)

The seemingly unacquisitive character of the expeditions perplexed
earlier dynastic historians, who generally dismissed them as
inconsequential, quixotic, and purposeless. The rulers themselves
clearly did not regard their campaigns as inconsequential, however,
for they repeatedly proclaimed them in inscriptions. First of all, the
"plucking and replanting" maneuver incorporated the subjugated
opponents into the imperial system, even while leaving them in
place. Further, the raids were concerned predominantly with, in
Rāṣṭrakūţa terms, the "acquisition of fame" --- and fame that could
be objectified in the capture of particular symbolic objects. The
peninsular powers regarded these objects as necessary to "manifest"
or "make visible" their claims to supreme sovereignty. In medieval
India, appropriating these signs of imperial sovereignty was a
crucial part of constructing what Ronald Inden calls an "imperial
formation."

An imperial formation in medieval India, as Inden describes
it, was not a single state under centralized administrative control,
nor was it a congeries of petty states warring against one another.
Rather, it was a single complex polity ruled by a king of kings who
exercised his sovereignty, directly or ritually, over other would-be
claimants throughout the subcontinent (Inden 1990:29-33,213-17).
In the "scale of kingships" (or "circle of kings," as Indian treatises
on statecraft put it), other kings would be compelled to recognize
the imperial sovereign as pre-eminent, for instance, by rendering
ceremonial homage at his court or through the forced attendance of
an iconic stand-in at the imperial capital. They became, willingly or
not, subordinate sharers in the transcending sovereignty of the king
of kings who managed to create or maintain an imperial formation.
Of course, subordinated rulers could always contest the ruling
hegemony by claiming autonomy and seeking to construct their own
"circle," but always with the risk that the empire might strike back.
Given the considerable strategic problems in holding together such
a polity, only a few dynasties succeeded in constituting longstanding
imperial formations in medieval India, and the Răştrakūtas of the
eighth through tenth centuries and the Colas of the eleventh and
twelfth centuries were the most formidable exemplars.

What did the rivers Ganga and Yamuna have to do with all this?
Prior to the time of the Calukya ruler Vinayaditya, every major
imperial kingdom of India had been centered on the Ganga-Yamunā
river system. The Magadha and Maurya empires had ruled from
Pataliputra, and the imperial Kuṣāṇas had maintained a capital at
Mathura. The Guptas originated at Prayaga, the very confluence
of Ganga and Yamuna, and ruled from there or Pataliputra. From
the time of Candragupta II, imperial Guptas prominently featured
statuary of Ganga and Yamuna in shrines throughout their domain,
evoking their own political center even as they invoked the
presence of the two goddesses (Goyal 1967; Williams 1982:45-
46). Later, Harşa moved his capital from the relatively peripheral
Sthaneśvara, along the upper reaches of the Yamuna, to the more
central Kanyakubja when he attained imperial status.

Faced with this political Gangocentricity, a regional power
aspiring to more encompassing imperial sovereignty had a choice
of moving to the center, as Harșa did, or of attempting to relocate
the center at one's own capital. The Calukyas, Rāştrakūtas, and
Colas evidently chose the second option. In their own version of
Muhammad-and-the-mountain, they brought not only the mountain
--- in the form of the Mount Kailasa-style temples of Śiva that they
each constructed --- but also the river that issued from that mountain
to their own sovereign selves, remaking in the process the imperial
topography of the subcontinent (Inden 1990:256-62).

In what form did they effect this? In the case of the Colas,
inscriptions state explicitly that Rajendra had Ganga water
transported in pots. With the Calukyas and Rāṣṭrakūtas, the evidence
is not so clear. Ganga and Yamunā are simply mentioned in lists
of insignia, along with other items of regalia such as banners and
musical instruments, indicating only that they are material things
of some sort. A Rāṣṭrakūṭa inscription does tell us that Ganga and
Yamunā are "made beautiful by their waves," which describes
the rivers themselves, of course, but would also apply to banners
waving in the breeze or to graceful sculpted images. Scholars have
offered at least three hypotheses: the Calukyas and Rāṣṭrakūtas
seized images of the goddesses Ganga and Yamunā; they seized
banners with Ganga and Yamuna imprinted on them; or they took
pots containing water from the two rivers. All are plausible. In light
of the recurrent plundering of images to make political statements
during the medieval period, however, I considered it most likely
that the Deccan powers looted images of Ganga and Yamunā from
existing temples at Prayaga or Kanyakubja.

Studies).

Even if they were not themselves images, though, the
appropriation of Ganga and Yamuna had an important bearing on
the art of their new homes. Both Calukyas and Raştrakūtas appear
to have commemorated their acquisitions by constructing shrines
with Ganga and Yamunā prominently featured. At Lad Khan temple
in Aihole, probably built during the reign of the Calukya king
Vijayāditya, images of the two river-goddesses are located on the
outer columns of the porch, displayed like trophies (Illustration 4).
Further, Ganga and Yamună appear as important icons in Calukyan
art only from this time on. It is not a matter of a slowly permeating
northern iconographic figure finally reaching the Deccan. Rather, it
appears that the Calukyas only now felt that they had attained the
degree of sovereignty where they could display with confidence
(and without fear of retribution) the North Indian river-goddesses.
As for the Răştrakūtas, Govinda III was probably responsible for
construction of the shrine of the Three River-Goddesses at Ellora,
and adjunct to the great Kailāśa rock-cut temple built there by
his predecessor Kṛṣṇa I (Goetz 1974:91-107). Three large panels
on the rear wall depict Ganga at the center flanked by Yamunā
and Sarasvatī, the subtle river that joins the other two at Prayaga.
After the Răştrakūta exploits in the Doab, the Rāṣṭrakūtas began
to include Ganga and Yamuna on their imperial seals, just as the
Calukyas had.

The most dramatic commemoration of Ganga-capture, however,
was that of Rajendra. When the waters reached the Cola territories,
Rajendra had a "liquid pillar of victory" made of Ganga-water,
designated the "Cola-Ganga," constructed in the new capital
that he had just built, Gangaikondacolapuram, the "city of the
Cola king who took the Ganga." Presiding over the city was a
new Kailāśa-like imperial Śiva temple (Illustration 5). Rajendra
furnished the city and the temple with objects and images seized
in the course of his conquests: from the Calukyas a Sun-pedestal,
several images of Durga, and a Gaṇeśa image; from the eastern
Calukyas, a resting Nandi, Siva's bull mount; from the Kalingas
of Orissa, three large stone images of Bhairava and Bhairavi and
an awesome eight-armed Kālī image; from the Palas of Bengal, a
bronze image of Śiva dancing on Nandi's back; and undoubtedly
many more since removed by the plunderers (Balasubrahmanyam
1975; Nagaswamy 1970; Sivaramamurti 1964a). At the four entry
gates of the fortified city, Rajendra placed images of the goddess
Durga or Kalī to act as guardians of the community within. One
of the guardians, at least, was a Calukyan conscript: a dramatic
stone image of eight-armed Durgă defeating the Buffalo-demon,
her left foot firmly planted on the back of the demon, who is on
his knees and fading fast (illustration 6). Though the _pālī_-banner
itself was no longer a target of imperial aspiration, the new capital
Rajendra built was a sort of city-scale _pālī_-banner, with the tower
of the Siva temple looming over the rows of loot, insignia of the
kings he had subordinated.

## Destruction of Devotion

Of all modes of expropriation, certainly the most radical involves
the destruction of images. Here it is not just a matter of change in
proprietor but a radical transformation in form. The image is reduced
to its material elements, denying or extinguishing any divine
presence that may have inhabited it and risking in the process the
possibility of divine retribution. Instead of continuing to exist as a
second-order signifier, the object is at one moment deconstituted in
an act powerful in rhetorical impact but limited in duration.

There is no question that medieval Hindu kings frequently
destroyed religious images as part of more general rampages. When
the Paramāras sacked the Răştraküţa capital of Manyakheta or when
the Colas leveled the Calukya capital at Kalyāṇī we must presume
that the many temples and images of those royal centers could not
have been spared. However, Hindu narratives and inscriptions seldom
describe destruction of images as a directed, politically meaningful
act. (Abundant narratives of intentional image destruction come
with the entry of Islam into the subcontinent, but that is another
story.) When they do, they most often treat it as an extraordinary
action, something morally ambiguous that may be justified only
in extreme situations. Take, for instance, the muddled image raid
of the Gauda soldiers, described by Kalhana in his _Rajatarangini_
(_RT_) (Stein 1892:56; Sitaram Pandit 1935:125-26).

The great eighth-century Kashmiri ruler Lalitāditya, according to
Kalhana's reckoning, was for the most part a high-minded monarch,
but he was also capable of duplicity in the service of imperial
policy. Once, after making a promise of safe conduct to the king
of Gauda (Bengal) and offering as surety (_madhyastha_; literally,
"intermediary") the image of Vişņu Parihāsakeśava, Lalitāditya
treacherously ordered the king assassinated. Such a brazen act
clearly departed from all standards of proper royal conduct and
called for revenge. As we might expect, the reprisal was directed
not at the perpetrator of the deed but at its intermediary. A troop
of the murdered king's dedicated attendants sneaked into Kashmir
posing as pilgrims and made their way toward the temple of
Parihāsakeśava.

Now Parihāsakeśava was not just any image. After Lalitāditya's
successful conquest of the directions in the mid-eighth century,
making him the premier ruler of North India, he returned to
Kashmir and established a new capital at the confluence of the
Vitasta and Sindhu rivers, Parihãsapura. In and around the new
capital, Lalitāditya and his retinue established a number of shrines,
but the dominant one was a _sarvatobhadra_ temple dedicated to
Vişņu Parihāsakeśava (Inden 1985). A _sarvatobhadra_ temple
was the highest form of temple structure, and the immense, silver
Parihāsakeśava that stood at its center was an image of Vişņu
Vaikuntha, the cosmic overlord whose four visages, facing in the
cardinal directions, represented Vişnu's four primary emanations.
This was the principal ruling image of the empire that Lalitāditya
had established, and to attack it was to threaten the very center of
that polity.

Outside the temple, the Gauda soldiers mustered, preparing to
destroy the imperial image. Fortunately for Lalitāditya, however,
the priests of Parihāsakeśava were a vigilant lot, and the Gauda
image raiders were not well-acquainted with the fine points of
Kashmiri images.

>Though the king was abroad, the priests observed that the soldiers wanted
to enter, and they closed the gates of the Parihāsakeśava shrine. Aroused
with boldness, the soldiers got ahold of the silver Ramasvāmin image,
which they mistook for Parihāsakeśava. They carried it out and ground
it into dust. And even as Lalitāditya's troops who had come out from
the city were killing them at each step, the Gaudas continued to break it
into particles and scatter them in every direction. (RT 4.326-28)

The image of Ramasvämin, silver as was Parihāsakeśava, had
been excavated some years earlier by Lalitāditya in a remote part
of Kashmir (RT 4.265-76). The king had it brought to the capital,
and a small stone shrine was built for it near the Parihāsakeśava
temple. Although supposed to be an ancient image (Lalitāditya
claimed it had been established by Rama himself), it certainly did
not possess the imperial grandeur of Parihāsakeśava. As clearly
indicated by the shrine housing it, Rāmasvamin occupied a position
subordinate to the imperial image of Vişņu within the hierarchy of
Kashmiri divinities.

By this token, then, the image raid of the Gauda avengers was
a botched affair. They failed to destroy Lalitāditya's central ruling
image, the image that had stood as deceitful assurance of their own
king's security, and they mistakenly crushed a lesser icon. But this
is not the moral that Kalhaņa draws from the incident. Rather, he
chooses to praise the extraordinary devotion that the raiders showed
to their former lord.

>The showers of their blood illuminated their uncommon devotion
(_bhakti_) to their lord, and the earth itself was enriched.... What a lengthy
path they traveled! And what devotion they showed to their deceased
ruler! The Creator himself could not accomplish what the Gauda soldiers
achieved that day. (_RT_ 4.330-32)

Utter devotional commitment to a lord (whether divine or human)
may in certain circumstances transcend normal moral evaluation.
Where the provocation is great, devotion may transmute normally
immoral acts into exemplary ones. The Gauda raiders, however,
were not the only ones to demonstrate loyalty to their superior.

>When those Gauda demons (_rakşasa_) brought destruction, the holy
Parihāsakeśava, the king's favored image, was protected through the
sacrifice of Ramasvämin. (_RT_ 4.334)

Images, too, are capable of _bhakti_ toward their lords.

## Final Destinations

The story did not necessarily end there for these images. Many of the
objects referred to in this article did suffer subsequent destruction.
The solid-gold Buddha of the Abhayagiri monastery, for example,
undoubtedly was destroyed in the 1017 Cola raid carried out by
Rajendra on Anuradhapura.

>They broke into the relic chambers in the three chambers and throughout
Lanka, stealing many costly images of gold and other metals. They
violently destroyed all the monasteries everywhere, and like yakşas
sucking blood they took away all the treasures of Lanka. (CV 55.20-21)

The two Buddhas sent by Aggabodhi VIII to appease the Rastrakūṭa
threat were destroyed either in the 972 razing of Manyakheta by
the Paramāra ruler Harşasīyaka or in the 1007 sack by Rajendra
Cola. The bejeweled Kaliyavadha Kṛṣṇa image that Lakṣmaṇaraja
Kalachuri stole from Orissa and gave to the deity at Somanātha was
no doubt expropriated during Maḥmad's 1026 destruction of the
temple and, following Ghaznavid policy, it would have been melted
down along with other metal idols to gild the mosque at Ghazna.

Several of the images, though, have escaped such fates and
have been able to continue their lives resituated as art objects
in Indian museums. Thus, the small stone Balakṛṣṇa carried by
Kṛṣṇadevarāya from Udayagiri to his own capital in 1512 was
thrown from its pedestal and its arms broken, perhaps in 1565,
when Muslim armies overran the city. Such desecration and
mutilation would have excluded the object from further ritual use.
For art objects, however, a degree of mutilation is not necessarily
a debit, for it may serve to certify age and authenticity. So, when
the archaeologist A. H. Longhurst found the image lying among the
debris of its disused temple in the early twentieth century, he sent it
off to join the collection of the Government Museum in Madras.

Museums are contexts too, of course, and the Udayagiri
Balakṛṣṇa once again has taken on a new significance in its new
location as part of a Museological narrative of national identity.
As we have seen, the appropriated Child-Kṛṣṇa image had been
previously set up in its temple at Vijayanagar both to be worshiped
as an icon of the god Krsna and to serve as a synecdoche for the
Gajapati kingdom subsumed within the encompassing Vijayanagar
imperial formation. But the political formations and agonistic
relations within which such rhetorical claims were stated and
made sense were themselves transient, and, when Gajapati and
Vijayanagar existed no more as polities, the metonymic role of the
Udayagiri Balakṛṣṇa would no longer have any currency.

Its new role derives rather, from the colonial and postcolonial
project of constructing an Indian national identity, a project in which
past antagonisms are effaced whenever possible in pursuit of a more
encompassing unity. This unity most often has been considered to
lie in the cultural domain rather than in any past political formation,
for, as the Government Museum's centennial souvenir volume put
it,"in spite of its great diversity, Indian culture has a common basic
pattern." During the twentieth century, religious objects and artifacts
of all sorts, embodying the collective artistic heritage of the Indian
nation, have been collected, dated, organized, and exhibited in the
Madras Museum. Since 1939, the sculptural arts of India have been
arranged chronologically, grouped according to major imperial
periods, to present to the Indian public an account of its own artistic
history in images. Here the Udayagiri Balakṛṣṇa that once signified
Gajapati subordination takes its place as a representative of the
"Vijayanagar period (1300-1600)."

For it, as for many Indian objects, the medieval rhetoric
of objects, of victory and incorporation, has given way to the
museological rhetoric of historical sequence and cumulative cultural
heritage.
