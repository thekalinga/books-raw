# Somanatha: Narratives of a History/*

/*: Authored by Romila Thapar

Since the last two hundred years or so, the narrative of the raid of
Mahmud of Ghazni on the temple of Somanātha has been derived
from a single source --- the Turko-Persian accounts. These speak of
repeated raids on the temple and the killing of Hindus and Shi'as,
suggesting that there was an immense resentment on the part of the
Hindus against the Muslims. This then became the basis of arguing
that the raid was seminal to the continuing antagonism between
Hindus and Muslims in history culminating in the hatred between
the two communities in the present day. Until recently there was
a reliance on a single source and historians did not attempt to co-
relate other texts that refer to Somanātha or to Maḥmūd./1 Had this
been done there would have been a rather different version of the
history of Somanātha.

The attempt in this essay is to also enquire into these other
sources and ascertain their perspectives on this history. Their
diversity is projected in the diversities of their histories. Even a
juxtaposition of these sources presents a different view of the history
of Somanātha. By focusing on the historiography of each source, not
only do the many voices of the past become audible, but the nature
of present day interpretations of the past, also become evident.

/1: Among the writings that have extended the horizon and pointed to the
importance of other sources are, A. K. Majumdar, _The Chaulukyas of Gujerat_,
1956; R. H. Davis, _Lives of Indian Images_, New Jersey 1997; Shahid Amin,

In 1026, Mahmud of Ghazni raided the temple of Somanātha
and broke the idol. Reference is made to this in various sources,
or, reference is omitted where one expects to find it. Some of the
references contradict each other. Some lead to our asking questions
which do not conform to what we have accepted so far in terms
of the meaning and the aftermath of the event. The narrating of
an event can get encrusted with interpretations from century to
century and this changes the perception of the event. As historians
therefore, we have to be aware not just of the event and how we look
upon it today, but also the ways in which the event was interpreted
through the intervening centuries. The analysis of these sources
and the priorities in explanation stem of course from the historian's
interpretation.

I would like to discuss some representations of this and other
events at Somanātha, keeping in mind the historical question of how
Mahmud's raid was viewed. They cover a wide span and are major
representations. These are the accounts originating from Turko-
Persian concerns, Jaina texts of the period, Sanskrit inscriptions
from Somanātha, some popular perceptions, the debate in the British
House of Commons and what is often described as a nationalist
reading of the event.

Let me begin with a brief background to Somanātha itself. It is
referred to in the _Mahabharata_ as _Prabhasa_, and although it had
no temple until later, it was a place of pilgrimage, a _tīrtha_ --- also
associated with Kṛṣṇa and the Pandavas./2 As was common to many
parts of the sub-continent there were a variety of religious sects
established in the area --- Buddhist, Jaina, Saiva and Muslim. Some
existed in succession and some conjointly. The Saiva temple, known
as the Somanātha temple at Prabhās, dates to about the ninth or tenth
century AD./3 The Caulukyas or Solankis were the ruling dynasty
in Gujarat during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. Kathiawar
was administered by lesser _rajäs_ some of whom were subordinates
of the Caulukyas.

Saurashtra was agriculturally fertile, but even more than that,
its prosperity came from trade. The port at Somanātha, known as
Veraval, was one of the three major ports of Gujarat. During this
period western India had a conspicuously wealthy trade with ports
along the Arabian peninsula and the Persian Gulf./4 The antecedents
of this trade go back many centuries. The Arab conquest of Sind
was less indelible than the more permanent contacts based on trade.
Arab traders and shippers settled along the west coast, married
locally and were ancestors to many communities existing to the
present. Some Arabs took employment with local rulers. Rāṣṭrakūta
inscriptions speak of them as Tajika administrators and governors./5
The counterparts to these Arab traders were Indian merchants based
at Hormuz in Persia, and at Ghazni, who, even after the eleventh
century, are described as extremely prosperous./6

The trade focused on the importing of horses from west Asia
and also included wine, metal, textiles and spices. The most
lucrative was the trade in horses." Funds from temples formed a

sizeable investment according to some sources./8 Port towns such as
Somanātha --- Veraval and Cambay derived a handsome income from
this trade, much of it doubtless being ploughed back to enlarge the
profits. Apart from trade, another source of local income were the
large sums of money collected in pilgrim taxes by the administration
in Somanātha. This was a fairly common source of revenue for the
same is mentioned in connection with the temple at Multan.' We are
also told that the local _rājās_ --- the Cuḍasamas, Abhīras, Yādavas and
others --- attacked the pilgrims and looted them of their donations
intended for the Somanātha temple. In addition there was heavy
piracy in the coastal areas indulged in by the local Chāvda _rājās_
and a variety of sea brigands referred to as the Bawarij.¹0 As with
many areas generating wealth in earlier times, this part of Gujarat
was also subject to unrest and the Caulukya administration spent
much time and energy policing attacks on pilgrims and traders.

Despite all this, trade flourished. Gujarat in this period
experienced what can perhaps be called a renaissance culture of
the Jaina mercantile community. Rich merchant families were in
political office, controlled state finances, were patrons of culture,
were scholars of the highest order, were liberal donors to the Jaina
_sangha_ and builders of magnificent temples.

This is the backdrop as it were, to the Somanātha temple which
by many accounts suffered a raid by Mahmud in 1026. There is
one sober, contemporary reference and this comes not surprisingly,
from Al-Bīrūni, a central Asian scholar deeply interested in India,
writing extensively on what he observed and learnt in the eleventh
century. He tells us that there was a stone fortress built about a
hundred years before Mahmud's raid, within which the _lingam_ was
located --- presumably to safeguard the wealth of the temple. The
idol was especially venerated by sailors and traders, not surprising
considering the importance of the port at Veraval, trading as far as
Zanzibar and China. He comments in a general way on the economic
devastation caused by the many raids of Mahmud. Al-Biruni also
mentions that Durlabha of Multan, presumably a mathematician,
used a round about way involving various eras, to compute the year
of the raid on Somanātha as Śaka 947 (equivalent to AD 1025-6)./11
The raid, therefore, was known to local sources.

Not unexpectedly, the Turko-Persian chronicles indulge in
elaborate myth-making around the event. A major poet of the eastern
Islamic world, Farrukhi Sīstānī, who claims that he accompanied
Mahmud to Somanātha, provides a fascinating explanation for the
breaking of the idol./12 This explanation has been largely dismissed
by modern historians as too fanciful, but it has a significance
for the assessment of iconoclasm. According to him the idol at
Somanātha was not of a Hindu deity but of a pre-Islamic Arabian
goddess. He tells us that the name Somnat (as it was often written
in Persian) is actually, Sa-manāt --- the place of Manät. We know
from the Qur'an that Lät, Uzza and Manat were the three pre-
Islamic goddesses widely worshipped,/13 and the destruction of their
shrines and images it was said, had been ordered by the prophet
Muhammad. Two were destroyed, but Manät was believed to have
been secreted away to Gujarat and installed in a place of worship.
According to some descriptions Manat was an aniconic block of
black stone, so the form could be similar to a _lingam_. This story
hovers over many of the Turko-Persian accounts, some taking it
seriously, others being less emphatic and insisting instead that the
icon was of a Hindu deity.

In the thirteenth century, the famous Persian poet Sa'di provides
a garbled description.14 He claims to have visited the Somanatha
temple, although there is no other mention of this. According to
him the idol was of ivory and decorated like the idol of Manat - a
faultless, female form. Its hands moved magically, but when he
secretly investigated this, it turned out that they were attached by
string to the hands of a person standing behind the idol who worked
their movements. According to him the rituals were conducted
by priests who came from Iran. This is obviously the fantasy of a
poet who has combined the story of Manat, information on string
puppets and rumours of some _brāhmaṇas_ having associations with
Iran and with the worship of the sun, perhaps confusing Somanātha
with the sun-temple at Multan.

The identification of the Somanātha idol with that of Manat
has little historical credibility. There is no evidence to suggest
that the temple housed an image of Manät. Nevertheless the story
is significant to the reconstruction of the aftermath of the event,
since it is closely tied to the kind of legitimation which was being
projected for Mahmud.

The link with Manat added to the acclaim for Mahmud. Not
only was he the prize iconoclast in breaking Hindu idols, but, in
destroying Manāt, he had carried out what were said to be the
very orders of the Prophet. He was therefore doubly a champion
of Islam.¹5 Other temples are raided by him and their idols broken,
but Somanātha receives special attention in all the accounts of
his activities. Writing of his victories to the Caliphate, Mahmud
presents them as major accomplishments in the cause of Islam. And
not surprisingly Mahmud becomes the recipient of grandiose titles.
This establishes his legitimacy in the politics of the Islamic world,
a dimension which is overlooked by those who see his activities
only in the context of northern India.

But his legitimacy also derives from the fact that he was a Sunni
Muslim and he attacked Isma'ilis and Shi'as whom the Sunnis
regarded as heretics./16 It was ironic that the Isma'ilīs attacked the
temple of Multan and were in turn attacked by Mahmud in the
eleventh century and their mosque was shut down. The fear of
the heretic was due to the popularity of heresies against orthodox
Islam and political hostility to the Caliphate in the previous couple
of centuries, none of which would be surprising given that Islam in
these areas was a relatively new religion. Mahmud is said to have
desecrated their places of worship at Multan and Manşūra. His
claims to having killed fifty thousand _käfirs_---infidels, is matched by
similar claims to his having killed fifty thousand Muslim heretics.
The figure appears to be notional. Maḥmūd's attacks on the Hindus
and on the Shi'as and Isma'ilīs, was a religious crusade against
the infidel and the heretic. But interestingly, these were also the
places and peoples involved in the highly profitable horse trade
with the Arabs and the Gulf. Both the Muslim heretics of Multan
and the Hindu traders of Somanātha had substantial commercial
investments. Is it possible then that Mahmud, in addition to religious
iconoclasm, was also trying to terminate the import of horses to
India via Sind and Gujarat? This would have curtailed the Arab
monopoly over the trade. Given the fact that there was a competitive
horse trade with Afghanistan through north-western India, which
was crucial to the wealth of the state of Ghazni, Mahmud may well
have been combining iconoclasm with trying to obtain a commercial
advantage./17

/15: Nazim, op. cit.

In the subsequent and multiple Persian accounts ---and there
are many in each century --- the contradictions and exaggerations
increase. There is no agreement on the form of the image. Some
say that it is a _lingam_, others reverse this and describe it as
anthropomorphic - a human form./18 But even with this there is no
consistency as to whether it is a female Manät or a male Śiva. There
seems to have been almost a lingering wish that it might be Manāt.
Was the icon, if identified with Manāt, more important perhaps to
Muslim sentiment?

The anthropomorphic form encouraged stories of the nose
being knocked off and the piercing of the belly from which jewels
poured forth./19 Fantasizing on the wealth of the temples evoked a
vision of immense opulence, and this could suggest that the Turkish
raids were a veritable 'gold-rush'/20 One account states that the
image contained twenty _man_ of jewels --- one man weighing several
kilograms; another, that a gold chain weighing two hundred _man_
kept the image in place. Yet another describes the icon as made of
iron with a magnet placed above it, so that it would be suspended
in space, an awesome sight for the worshipper./21 The age of the
temple is taken further and further back in time until it is described
as thirty thousand years old. One wonders if Somanātha was not
becoming something of a fantasy in such accounts.

More purposive writing of the fourteenth century are the
chronicles of Baranī and 'Işāmī. Both were associated with courts,
one with the Delhi Sultanate and the other with the Bahmani
kingdom of the Deccan. Both project Maḥmud as the ideal Muslim
ruler, but somewhat differently. Baranī states that his writing is
intended to educate Muslim rulers in their duties towards Islam. 22
For him, religion and kingship are twins and the ruler needs to
know the religious ideals of kingship if he claims to be ruling on
behalf of God. Sultans must protect Islam through the shari'a and
destroy both Muslim heretics and infidels. Mahmud is said to be
the ideal ruler because he did both.

'Işămi composes what he regards as an epic poem on the Muslim
rulers of India, on the lines of the famous Persian poet Firdausī's
earlier epic on the Persian kings, the Shah-nama. 'Işāmī argues
that kingship descended from God, first to the pre-Islamic rulers
of Persia ---in which he includes Alexander of Macedon and the
Sassanid kings, and subsequently to the Sultans of India, with
Mahmud establishing Muslim rule in India./23 Interestingly the
Arabs, who had both a political and economic presence in the sub-
continent prior to Mahmud, hardly figure in this history. That there
is a difference of perception in these narratives, is important to a
historical assessment and requires further investigation.

The role of Maḥmūd it would seem, was undergoing a change
from being viewed merely as an iconoclast to also being projected as
the founder of an Islamic state in India, even if the latter statement
was not historically accurate. Presumably given his status in Islamic
historiography this was a form of indirectly legitimizing the Sultans
in India. The appropriation of the pre-Islamic Persian rulers for
purposes of legitimacy, suggests that there may have been an
element of doubt about the accepted role models of Muslim rulers.
The Sultans in India were not only ruling a society substantially
of non-Muslims, but even those who had converted to Islam were
in large part following the customary practices of their zāt, their
erstwhile Hindu caste, which were often not in conformity with
the shart'a. Is there then a hint of an underlying uncertainty, of a
lack of confidence, in the insistence on taking Islamic rule back to
Mahmud, a champion of the Islamic world? Can we say that these
accounts had converted the event itself at Somanātha, into what
some today would call, an icon?

In the post-fourteenth century, narratives of the event continue
with still greater embellishments and these are perhaps what we
would see as a cloud of hype. Of the actual temple the impression
sought to be created is that it never recovered from the raid and
ceased to be important. Yet every few decades some Sultan is
said to have attacked the Somanätha temple and converted it into
a mosque./24 Logically therefore, and logic is not at a premium in
these accounts, they would, after the first attack, be attacking a
mosque. In a sense the claim ceases to be history and becomes
rhetoric. Nor does this stop Sanskrit texts from continuing to refer
to it as a temple, a holy city, a second Kailasa.25 Was this a parallel
situation to the mosque-church toggle-switching at places such as
Cordoba in Spain and Santa Sophia in Istanbul, each time the area
changed rulers or a religion receded?

Let me turn now to the Jaina texts of this period. These, not
unexpectedly associate a different set of concerns with the event,
or else they ignore it. The eleventh century Jaina poet from the
Paramāra court in Malwa, Dhanapala, a contemporary of Mahmud,
briefly mentions Maḥmūd's campaign in Gujarat and his raids on
various places including Somanātha.26 He comments however, at
much greater length on Mahmud's inability to damage the icons of
Mahāvīra in Jaina temples for, as he puts it, snakes cannot swallow
Garuda nor can stars dim the light of the sun. This for him is proof
of the superior power of the Jaina images as compared to the Saiva,
the latter having been descecrated.

In the early twelfth century, another Jaina text informs us
that the Caulukya king, angered by the _rakṣasas_, the _daityas_ and
the _asuras_ who were destroying temples and disturbing the _rşis_
and _brāhmaṇas_, campaigned against them./27 One expects the
list to include the Turuşkas as the Turks were called, but instead
mention is made of the local _rajas_. The king is said to have made
a pilgrimage to Somanātha and found that the temple was old and
was disintegrating. He is said to have stated that it was a disgrace
that the local _rājās_ were plundering pilgrims but could not keep the
temples in good repair. This is the same king who built a mosque at
Cambay, which mosque was later destroyed in a campaign against
the Caulukyas of Gujarat by the Paramāras of Malwa. But the
Paramāra king also looted the Jaina and other temples built under
the patronage of the Caulukyas./28 It would seem that when the
temple was seen as a statement of power, it could become a target
of attack, irrespective of religious affiliations.

_Indian Antiquary_ 1882, 11, 245-56.

In the late twelfth century during the reign of the famous
Caulukya king, Kumārapāla, there is much activity around the
Somanātha temple. Among the ministers of Kumārapāla was
Hemacandra, a respected and erudite scholar of Jaina religious
history, and incidentally a rival of the Saiva Paśupata chief priest of
the Somanātha temple, Bhava Brhaspati. Such Śaiva-Jaina rivalry
was known to other parts of the sub-continent as well. There is
therefore some discrepancy between the statements of the minister
and chief priest.

Various Jaina texts, giving the history of Kumārapāla mention
his connection with Somanātha. It is stated that he wished to be
immortalized./29 So Hemacandra persuaded the king to replace the
dilapidated temple at Somanātha with a new stone temple. The
temple is clearly described as dilapidated and not destroyed having
fallen into disrepair because of weathering from seaspray. When
the new temple on the location of the old had been completed, both
Kumārapāla and Hemacandra took part in the ritual of consecration.
Hemacandra wished to impress the king with the spiritual powers
of a Jaina _ācārya_, so on his bidding, Siva, the deity of the temple,
appeared before the king. Kumārapāla was so overcome by this
miracle that he converted to the Jaina faith. The focus again is on
the superior power of Jainism over Saivism. The renovating of the
temple which is also important, takes on the symbolism of political
legitimation for the king. It does seem curious that these activities
focused on the Somanātha temple, yet no mention is made of
Mahmud, in spite of the raid having occurred in the previous couple
of centuries. The miracle is the central point in the connection with
Somanātha in these accounts.

Some suggestions of an anguish over what may be indirect
references to the raids of Mahmud come from quite other Jaina
sources and interestingly these relate to the merchant community.
In an anthology of stories, one refers to the merchant Javadi, who
quickly makes a fortune in trade and then goes in search of a Jaina
icon which had been taken away to the land called Gajjana./30 This
is clearly Ghazna. The ruler of Gajjana was a Yavana -- a term
by now used for those coming from the west. The Yavana ruler
was easily won over by the wealth presented to him by Jāvaḍi.
He allowed Javadi to search for the icon and when it was found,
gave him permission to take it back. Not only that but the Yavana
worshipped the icon prior to its departure. The second part of the
narrative deals with the vicissitudes of having the icon installed in
Gujarat, but that is another story.

This is a reconciliation story with a certain element of wishful
thinking. The initial removal of the icon is hurtful and creates
anguish. Its return should ideally be through reconciling iconoclasts
to the worship of icons. There are other touching stories in which the
ruler of Gajjana or other Yavana kings are persuaded not to attack
Gujarat. But such stories are generally related as a demonstration
of the power of the Jaina _ācāryas_.

The Jaina sources therefore underline their own ideology. Jaina
temples survive, Śaiva temples get destroyed. Śiva has abandoned
his icons unlike Mahāvīra who still resides in his icons and protects

Builders', _East and West_, 42, 1992, 2-4, 301-17; R. Davis, op.cit., 194-96.

them. Attacks are to be expected in the Kaliyuga - the present age
--- since it is an age of evil. Icons will be broken but wealthy Jaina
merchants will restore the temple and the icons will invariably and
miraculously, mend themselves.
The argument about Kaliyuga and iconoclasm also occurs in
the Puranas, where an increasing decline in dharma accompanies
the passing of the cycle of time. Deities desert their icons in the
Kaliyuga especially if kings are not attentive enough to them.31
Sometimes there is a mention of temples being destroyed but
generally they are said to have been dilapidated and neglected -as
would be expected in an age of declining virtue - and therefore
requiring repair. The association with Kaliyuga gives the situation
a feeling of infallibility. Kaliyuga is therefore a partial but
generalized reference to the vulnerability of the practice and symbol
of dharma. What remains curious is the lack of specific mention
about Maḥmūd's raid on Somanatha, which in the Turko-Persian
chronicles is so central.
The third category of major narratives is constituted by the
inscriptions in Sanskrit from Somanātha itself, focusing on the
temple and the vicinity. These are perhaps the most important
sources and have been frequently cited and read since the late
nineteenth century, but seldom in the context of local history. The
perspectives which these point to are again very different from
the earlier two sources. In the twelfth century the Caulukya king,
Kumārapāla, issues an inscription. He appoints a governor to
protect Somanātha and the protection is against the piracy and the
looting by the local _rajas_.32 A century later, the Caulukyas are again
protecting the site, this time from attacks by the Malwa _rajas_.33 The

regular complaint about local _rajas_ looting pilgrims at Somanātha
becomes a continuing refrain in many inscriptions.
In 1169, an inscription records the appointment of the chief priest
of the Somanātha temple, Bhava Brhaspati.34 He claims to have
come from Kannauj, from a family of Pasupata Śaiva _brāhmaṇas_
and, as the inscriptions show, initiated a succession of powerful
priests at the Somanātha temple. He states that he was sent by
Śiva himself to rehabilitate the temple. This was required because
it was an old structure, much neglected by the wicked and greedy
officers and because temples in any case deteriorate in the Kaliyuga.
Bhava Brhaspati claims that it was he who persuaded Kumārapāla
to replace the older wooden temple with a stone temple.
Again no mention is made of the raid of Mahmud. Was this out
of embarrassment, that a powerful icon of Siva had been desecrated?
Or was the looting of a temple not such an extraordinary event?
The Turko-Persian chronicles may well have been indulging in
exaggeration. Yet the looting of the pilgrims by the local _rājās_ is
repeatedly mentioned. Was Kumarapala's renovation both an act
of veneration of Śiva but also a seeking of legitimation? Was this
in a sense an inversion of Mahmud seeking legitimation through
raiding the temple? Are these then counter-points of legitimation
in viewing the past?
In 1264, a long legal document was issued in the form of an
inscription with both a Sanskrit and an Arabic version and concerns
the acquisition of land and the building of a mosque by a trader
from Hormuz.35 Being a legal document it was dated in four current
dating systems - Hijrī, Samvat, Simha and Valabhi. The Sanskrit
version begins with the usual formulaic symbol - the siddham
- and continues with invoking Visvanatha, a name for Śiva. But
there is also a suggestion that it was a rendering into Sanskrit of
Allah, the lord of the Universe. The parallel is striking at more
than one place in the inscription and can be viewed as yet another

Maladeva, and the Caulukya-Vaghela king, Arjunadeva.

The acquisition of this land has the approval of two local
bodies the pañcakula and the association of the jamatha. The
pañcakulas were powerful administrative and local committees,
well established by this period, consisting of recognized authorities
such as priests, officers, merchants, local dignitaries. This particular
pancakula was headed by the Para/purohita Virabhadra, the Saiva
Pasupata _ācārya_ most likely of the Somanātha temple, and among
its members was the merchant Abhaysimha. From other inscriptions
it would seem that Para Virabhadra was related to Bhava Brhaspati
in a line of succession. The witnesses to this agreement of granting
land for the building of the mosque are mentioned by name and
described as the brhat-puruşa, literally 'the big men'. They were
the Thakkuras, Rāṇakas, Rājās and merchants, many from the
Mahājanapalī. Some of these dignitaries were functionaries of the
estates of the Somanātha and other temples. The land given for the
mosque in Mahajanapālī was part of these estates.
The other committee endorsing the agreement was the jamatha,
consisting of ship-owners, artisans, sailors and religious teachers,
probably from Hormuz. Also mentioned are the oil-millers, masons
and Musalmāna horse-handlers, all referred to by what appear to be
occupational or caste names, such as cūnākāra and ghamcika. Were
these local converts to Islam? Since the jamätha was to ensure these
endowments for the maintenance of the mosque, it was necessary
to indicate its membership.

The inscription lists the endowments for the mosque. These
included two large measures of land which were part of the temple
property from adjoining temples situated in Somanātha-pattana;
land from a matha; income from two shops in the vicinity; and
an oil mill. The measures of land were bought from the purohita
and the chief priests of the temples and the sales were attested by
the men of rank. The shops and the oil-mill were purchased from
the local people. One of the chief priests, Tripurantaka, seems to
appear again, twenty-three years later, in a number of inscriptions
as a wealthy and powerful Pasupata Saiva priest who built many
temples in the vicinity.36 As with many Sanskrit votive inscriptions,
it ends with the hope that the terms and conditions of the agreement
may last as long as the moon and sun endure.
The tone and sentiment of the inscription is amicable and clearly
the settlement had been agreed to on all sides. The building of a
substantial mosque in association with some of the properties of
the Somanātha temple, not by a conqueror but by a trader through a
legal agreement, was obviously not objected to, neither by the local
governor and dignitaries nor by the priests, all of whom were party
to the decision. The mosque is thus closely linked to the erstwhile
properties and the functionaries of the Somanātha temple.
This raises many questions. Did this transaction, two hundred
or so years after the raid of Mahmud, not interfere with the
remembrance of the raid as handed down, in the minds of the
priests and the local 'big men'? Were memories short or was the
event relatively unimportant?
Nuruddin Feroz used Sanskrit and Arabic for the agreement,
Sanskrit as the local formal language and Arabic probably as
the language of incoming traders. The two texts are by and large
similar but not identical. The Arabic version carries the hope that
the people of Somanatha will convert to Islam - a statement which
is wisely deleted in the Sanskrit version. The use of Arabic points
to a specific identity distinct from the use of Persian in connection

with Mahmud. Did the local people make a distinction between the
Arab and west Asian traders on the one hand often referred to
as Tajikas, and the Turks or Turuşkas on the other? And were the
former acceptable and the Turks much less so? Clearly they were
not all homogenized and identified as 'Muslims', as we would do
today. Should we not sift the reactions to the event by examining
the responses of particular social groups and situations? Hormuz
was crucial to the horse trade, therefore Nuruddin was welcomed.
Did the profits of trade over-rule other considerations? Were the
temples and their administrators also investing in horse trading and
making handsome profits?
In the fifteenth century a number of short inscriptions from
Gujarat refer to the battles against the Turks. One very moving
inscription in Sanskrit comes from Somanātha itself.37 Although
written in Sanskrit, it begins with the Islamic formulaic blessing
- bismillah ir-raḥmān ir-raḥīm. It gives details of the family of the
Vohara/Bohra Farīd who were of Arab descent. We are told that
the town of Somanātha was attacked by the Turuşkas, the Turks,
and Vohara Farīd who was the son of Vohara Muḥammad, joined
in the defence of the town, fighting against the Turuşkas on behalf
of the local ruler Brahmadeva. Farīd was killed and the inscription
is a memorial to him.
The received opinion is that events such as the raid on Somanātha
created what have been called two antagonistic categories of epic:
the "epics of conquest" written in Persian to glorify Muslim rule
and the "counter-epics of resistance" written in Hindi, Rajasthani/
Gujarati, to highlight Hindu resistance to the Muslims.38 This
statement is frequently accepted but requires some further analysis.3⁹

The counter-epics of resistance are said to be the poems on the
heroic deeds of Prthviraja Chauhan resisting Muḥammad Ghūrī
as also those featuring the events, later in time, of the reign of
'Ala'-ud-din Khalji, such as the Kanhadade Prabandha and the
Hammtramahākavya.
The hostility in the Prthviraja poems appears to be more that of
the Rajput for the Turk and vice versa, than that of the Hindu for
the Muslim. The battle was over territory and it was the territory
of the Chauhans that the Turks were trying to conquer. The epics
on Prthvīrāja such as the Prthviraja-raso of Chand Bardai and the
Prthviraja-vijaya of Jayanaka, were in the style of eulogies as
were many such courtly poems and were not intended primarily
as factual accounts. Poets therefore took liberties did Chand
Bardai in narrating the captivity and death of Prthvīrāja. As in
much courtly literature there is an overlay of exaggeration that has
to be pared away.
The start of the narrative is often stereo-typical where disloyalty
to the Rajput king by a high-ranking advisor reflects on how the
hostilities begin. Mention is made of a minister, often a brāhmaṇa,
who is slighted by the Rajput king and therefore defects to the Turkish
side and assists the Turkish ruler to conquer the Chauhan domain.
Merutunga's Prabandhacintamani has a variant version from those
usually quoted such as the Prthviraja-rāso and the Prthvivijaya.
Merutunga relates that Someśvara, the minister of Prthvīrāja, tried
to dissuade the king from going into battle against the mlecchas,
presumably the Turks. The king insulted him so the minister joined
the mlecchas. Prthvīrāja lost the battle and was captured, but the
mleccha king decided to reinstate him. On arriving at the Chauhan
capital, the mleccha king saw paintings of pigs killing the mlecchas
and this so incensed him that he had Pṛthvīrāja killed.40 It could be
argued that this narrative points to hostility between the Hindu king
and the Muslim Sultan, but it points also to a confrontation between
40 Prabandhacintamani 5.11.216.

the brāhmaṇa minister and the ksatriya ruler, a confrontation not
unknown to the politics of Rajput courts.
The epics relating to 'Ala'-ud-din Khalji are different in tone and
narrative. The role of the Turks had changed as they were now not
merely seeking to conquer territory but were asserting themselves
as the established rulers seeking to extend their administrative
control. The conflict is now a Chauhan-Khalji competition for
power. The story in the Kanhadade Prabandha also begins with the
betrayal by a brāhmaṇa minister.41 'Ala'-ud-din's general returns
with the _lingam_ from the Somanātha temple, but it is rescued en
route to Delhi by the Rajput ruler of Jalor. (However, the account of
Baranī writing from Delhi differs, as according to him the _lingam_
was brought to Delhi and displayed in the capital, presumably as
a trophy).42 Curiously there is no reference to the earlier Turkish
attack on the temple by Mahmud. Despite the hostility towards the
Turk much of the epic focuses on other matters, including a proposal
of marriage sent by 'Ala'-ud-din whose daughter wishes to marry
the prince of Jalor. She recalls at length the many previous births
when they were married. The prince rejects the proposal as it would
bring dishonour to the Rajput, but it is unclear as to whether the
dishonour was because he would be marrying the daughter of a
current enemy or because as a Muslim she was a mleccha in terms
of her caste identity.
According to the Hammīramahākavya, the Rajput ruler of
Ranthambhor, Hammīra, was attacked by 'Ala'-ud-din, because
he gave shelter to the Mongol Muslims hostile to the Turks and
because he had failed to pay the annual tribute.43 Refusal to pay the

43 Hammtramahäkävya, IX. 1-27; 39-47; X. 8-10; 88: XI. 1-2; XIII. 69-166. The
name Hammīra has its own interest. It is a Sanskritic rendering of the title Amir
used for chiefs and rulers. Mahmud for instance, is often given this title. That

annual tribute can be read as resistance but this kind of resistance
would have existed in pre-Islamic times as well. That he was close
to the Mongol Muslims again points to a political opposition to
the Khaljis rather than one based solely on religion. Only a third
of the Hammiramahäkävya deals with this confrontation, the rest
relating his campaigns against various Rajput rulers and their mutual
hostilities. Most of Hammira's Rajput ministers and officers of
rank double-crossed him and joined 'Ala'-ud-din, but the one who
remained loyal to the end was his Mongol Muslim minister. It has
been argued that the question of loyalty and disloyalty was more
central to many of these relationships than religious affiliations
alone.44
These are the poems that have been quoted as epics of Hindu
resistance but they hardly conform to this description. In essence
they continue the earlier pre-Islamic tradition of the caritas or
biographies of kings, and they endorse the values of the culture
of royal courts. Wherever campaigns are conducted the enemy is
described in as much gory detail as are the Turks in these accounts.
There were some occasions when the hostility was expressed in
religious terms but more often there were other reasons and concerns
for hostility. To argue therefore that these were epics drawing
largely, if not only, on religious resistance, seems unconvincing.
There are other voices that have so far been ignored by historians
but which are now beginning to be heard. References to Mahmud
or his nephew in popular narratives take an unexpected turn and
provide reflections on these events that are different from the
received version. A text that is generally regarded as spurious by
historians, refers to a certain Salar Mas'ud as a nephew of Mahmud.
There is little evidence for such a person. But what is of interest
is that the narrative of his supposed early life as a phenomenal
conquering general was set aside in the popular tradition and he
a number of Rajputs took this name suggests some admiration for the Turks.

emerged as the widely worshipped pir of northern India, Ghāzī
Miyan.45 Among the most frequently repeated stories about him
is the one that relates his death as occurring when he was called
upon to prevent a local raja from killing a herd of cows belonging
to the Ahirs. This story is associated with other local leaders, but
what is significant that it is particularly known in connection with
Ghazi Miyan.
In the interface between Hinduism and Islam during the period
after the fourteenth century, the most widely prevalent religious
forms that emerged were those of the Bhakti sants, the Nathapanthis
and Sakta groups and Sufi sects. In the tradition of Gorakhanatha
and in some Tantric compositions, such as the Sabara Tantra,
Mahmud is invoked and his name occurs among those of pīrs and
gurus.46 These perceptions and the concerns of their authors were
strikingly different from those that are generally quoted from the
Persian chronicles.
It would seem from these sources that the aftermath of the raid
of Mahmud took the form of varying perceptions of the event and
different from what has been previously assumed, particularly as
seminal to a continuing Hindu--Muslim antagonism. How then have
we arrived today at the rather simplistic historical theory that the
raid of Mahmud created a trauma in the Hindu consciousness which
has been at the root of Hindu--Muslim relations ever since. Or to
put it in the words of K. M. Munshi writing in 1951 and referring
to Somanātha and the Hindus, "For a thousand years Maḥmūd's
destruction of the shrine has been burnt into the collective
subconscious of the race as an unforgettable national disaster."47

Interestingly what appears to be the earliest mention of a "Hindu
trauma" in connection with Mahmud's raid on Somanātha, comes
from the debate in the British Parliament in London in 1843, on
the question of the gates of the Somanātha temple.48 In 1842, the
Governor-General of India, Lord Ellenborough, issued his famous
Proclamation of the gates, in which he ordered the general in charge
of the British army in Afghanistan, to return via Ghazni and bring
back to India the sandalwood gates from the tomb of Mahmud.
These were believed to have been looted from Somanātha. It was
claimed that the intention was to return what was looted from India,
an act which symbolized British control over Afghanistan despite
their
poor showing in the Anglo-Afghan wars. It was also presented
as an attempt to reverse Indian subjugation to Afghanistan in the
pre-British period.
The Proclamation raised a storm in the House of Commons and
became a major issue in the cross-fire between the Government and
the Opposition. The question was asked whether Ellenborough was
catering to religious prejudices by appeasing the Hindus, or, was
he appealing to national sympathies? It was also argued that no
historian mentions the gates in the various accounts of Mahmud's
raid, therefore the story of the gates could only be a fabrication
which Ellenborough foolishly took as history. Where the story of
the gates came from remains a mystery although there are some
associations with the demands made by Ranjit Singh who was then
ruling in the Punjab, from the king of Afghanistan.4⁹ But Ranjit
Singh does not appear to have been very clear about which gates he
was demanding and this may have been merely a bargaining point
with the king of Afghanistan.
The chronicles in Persian written at the courts of the Sultans
and the Mughals were taken as relatively reliable history by British

historians. Their form was familiar to colonial historians and they
were suggestive of the essentials of nineteenth century historical
writing in their concern for chronology and sequential narrative
and in their treatment of politically important events. There was
little interest in questioning the ideological perspective of these
narratives. In propagating the greatness of Muslim rulers they may
well have exaggerated and dramatized the power of such rulers
over their subjects. The exaggeration could have been occasioned
by an actually tenuous relationship between ruler and subject,
characteristic even of political conditions in some Indian power
centers of earlier times. Among the narratives describing the event,
the British were perhaps most familiar with the account of the
seventeenth century historian Ferishta as this had been rendered into
English by Alexander Dow in the eighteenth century in his History
of Hindustan. Ferishta's account was as fanciful as the earlier ones,
but now with further obvious exaggerations. Nevertheless it became
the accepted version. A further dimension to the Hindu--Muslim
dichotomy was expressed by James Mill through his periodisation
of Indian history into Hindu civilization, Muslim civilization and the
British period. In his hegemonic History of British India, published
in the early nineteenth century and extensively read, Mill insists
not only on the innate hostility of Hindu and Muslim, but also on
the tyranny of the Muslim over the Hindu and the oppression of
the Hindu by the Muslim. Mill had neither visited India nor read
anything substantial on Indian history. The colonial interest in
emphasizing this view is clearly stated in the Introduction to Elliot
and Dowson's History of India as Told by its Own Historians, where
it is said that the Hindus have to recognize that British rule is far
superior for them than the rule of the Muslims.50
Given this background even members of the House of
Commons saw the relations between the Hindus and Muslims
as dichotomous and were also using their perceptions of Indian
history as ammunition in their own political and party hostilities.
50 Elliot and Dowson, op.cit., Vol.1.

Those critical of Ellenborough were fearful of the consequences:
they saw the fetching of the gates as supporting a native religion,
and that too the monstrous Linga-ism as they called it; and they
felt that its political consequences would be violent indignation
among the Muslims. Those supporting Ellenborogh argued equally
vehemently that he was removing the feeling of degradation from
the minds of the Hindus: that "it would relieve that country which
had been overrun by the Mohammadan conqueror, from the painful
feelings which had been rankling amongst the people for nearly a
thousand years." The memory of the gates were thought to have
been a painful memorial of the most devastating invasions that had
ever desolated the country. The gates were uprooted and brought
back but were found to be of non-Indian origin and in fact not
associated with India.51
The more significant question is that of the wider implications
of this debate on the Indian people. Did this debate fan an anti-
Muslim Hindu sentiment among Hindus in India, which, judging
from the earlier sources, had either not existed or had been marginal
and localized? The absence in earlier times of an articulation of a
trauma remains enigmatic. Historians have commented on the fact
that there is no reference to the raid of Mahmud in non-Persian
sources from India.52
From this point on, the arguments of the debate in the House
of Commons come to be reflected in the writing on Somanātha.
Mahmūd's raid became a central point in Hindu--Muslim relations.
K. M. Munshi led the demand for the restoration of the Somanātha
temple soon after Indian independence in 1947. His wish to highlight
the glories of Hindu history began in a general way with his writing
historical novels and he then turned to eulogizing the Aryan glory
of the pre-Islamic past. Historical novels became fashionable in
India with Walter Scott and Alexander Dumas providing the models.

1910 (revised ed.) Vol.2., 192.

Munshi's historical novel, Jaya Somanatha, was published in 1937.
It is thought that some touches of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's
Anandamatha are discernable in Munshi's novel. And as one
historian, R. C. Majumdar puts it, Bankim Chandra's nationalism
was Hindu rather than Indian, with passionate outbursts against the
subjugation of India by the Muslims,53 although this did not prevent
him from expressing anti-colonial sentiments when he chose to.
Munshi's comments in his book, Somanatha - The Shrine Eternal,
sometimes echo the statements made in the British Parliament.
His insistence that the temple be restored was preceded by
the excavation of the site in 1950, the results of which did not
agree with much of his narrative of the history of Somanātha.
The reconstruction through archaeology and architectural history
indicated an original temple of the ninth or tenth century, with some
signs of desecration, but with as much weathering through sea-
spray.54 An eleventh century temple was rebuilt on an earlier plan
and this structure was replaced with a more elaborate structure in
about the twelfth century. There is little evidence of later structures
or reconstructions. This evidence incidentally runs parallel to the
Sanskrit inscriptions and the Jaina sources.
On the rebuilding of the temple in 1951, Munshi, by then a
minister of the central government suggested that this was an
enterprise supported by the Government of India. Jawaharlal Nehru
and some of his colleagues objected strongly to the association of
the Government of India with this project. They insisted on its being
restored as a private venture and to this effect a private Somnath
Trust was established to finance and supervise the rebuilding.55 This

introduces a further dimension to the reading of the event, involving
the secular credentials of society and state.
The temple of Somanātha was to surface again four decades
later as an important political symbol. The theories of the colonial
historians, endorsed and garnished by religious nationalism,
had now been internalized by various religious nationalisms
and more particularly by the ideologies of Hindu and Muslim
communalism. Somanātha was being projected as the symbol
of Hindu--Muslim antagonism. When the mobilization of Hindus
around the Ramjanmabhoomi movement was initiated, the ratha-
yatra was started from Somanätha and travelled to Ayodhya.
Here the subsequent destruction of the Babri Masjid in 1992, was
acclaimed by those who endorsed the antagonism as avenging the
raid of Mahmud on Somanātha.
We may well ask how and when did this dichotomy seen as
emerging from the raid, crystallize? Did this happen through
modern historians reading too literally from just one set of
narratives, without juxtaposing these with other narratives in
order to understand the nature of the events? If narratives are read
without being placed in the context of their times and the ideologies
that might have motivated them, the reading is incomplete and,
therefore, distorted. There is also the need to investigate the purpose
for which particular texts are written and what bearing this had on
the way an event was presented: whether it was ignored or else its
importance was exaggerated.
We continue to see such situations as a binary projection of
Hindu and Muslim. Yet what should be evident from the sources
discussed here, is that there are multiple groups with varying
agendas, involved in the way in which events at Somanātha are
represented. Thus, there are differentiations in the attitudes of the
Persian chronicles towards the Arabs and the Turks. The hostility
between the Bohras and the Turks, technically both Muslims, was
also part of this confrontation. Biographies and histories from Jaina
authors, discussing matters pertinent to the royal court and to the

religion of the elite, focus on competing rivalry between the Jainas
and the Saivas. But the sources which focus on a different social
group, that of Jaina merchants, seem to be conciliatory towards
the confrontation with the Turks, probably because the trading
community would have suffered disruptions in periods of raids
and campaigns.
From the thirteenth century inscription of Nur-ud-din Firoz, the
ship owner from Persia, it seems evident that co-operation in the
building of the mosque came from a range of social groups, from
the most orthodox priests to those wielding secular authority and
from the highest property owners to those with lesser property.
These relationships were not determined by the general category
of what have been termed "Hindu" and "Muslim" interests and
concerns. They varied in accordance with more particular interests,
and these drew on identities of ethnicity, economic concerns,
religious sectarianism and social status. To narrow these identities
to merely the single one of religion - either Hindu or Muslim - is
an injustice to their history.
In the retelling of an event, there may be a claim that it
encapsulates memory, or a succession of memories. Memory is
sometimes claimed in order to create an identity and history based
on such claims is used to legitimize the identity. Exploring a fuller
understanding of the event is crucial to assessing the validity of this
process. That such attempts are often politically motivated becomes
evident when one realizes that today the destruction of temples by
Muslim rulers is constantly re-iterated, but little mention is made
of the destruction of temples by Hindu rulers. The latter were not
nearly as many in number but the reasons for their destruction
remain significant. It has been argued that temple destruction by
Hindu rulers was symbolic of conquest, irrespective of the religion
of the conqueror or the defeated. In the case of Muslim rulers,
religious iconoclasm was an added reason, except that even here,
not all temples were indiscriminately destroyed and the choice of

the temple that was destroyed had much to do with political and
territorial ambitions.56
The claim to historical memory emerges from what has been
constructed at a particular point in time and for a particular function,
as was done in this case by the British for reasons of colonial
politics. That the British were successful in their political intention
is proved by Somanātha having now become an icon of antagonism
between Hindus and Muslims.
I have tried to show how each set of narratives turn the focus
of what Somanātha symbolises: the occasion for the projection
of the iconoclast and champion of Islam; the assertion of the
superiority of Jainism over Saivism; the centrality of the profits
of trade subordinating other considerations; colonial perceptions
of Indian society as having always been an antagonistic duality of
Hindu and Muslim; religious nationalism - both Hindu and Muslim
-projecting a particular view of the past opposed to a more rational
historical enquiry; Hindu nationalism contesting the contemporary
secularization of Indian society. But these are not discrete foci. They
do require that the understanding of an event should be historically
contextual, multi-faceted and aware of the ideological structures
implicit in the narratives.

TEMPLE DESECRATION AND
INDO-MUSLIM STATES¹
RICHARD M. EATON
Framing the Issue
In recent years, especially in the wake of the destruction of the
Baburi Mosque in 1992, much public discussion has arisen over
the political status of South Asian temples and mosques, and in
particular the issue of temples desecrated or replaced by mosques
in the pre-British period. While Hindu nationalists have endeavored
to document a pattern of wholesale temple destruction by Muslims
in this period,¹ few professional historians have engaged the issue,
even though it is a properly historical one. This essay aims to
examine the evidence of temple desecration with a view to asking:
Which temples were desecrated in India's premodern history?
When, and by whom? How, and for what purpose? And above all,
what might any of this say about the relationship between religion
and politics in premodern India? This is a timely topic, since many
in India today are looking to the past to justify or condemn public
policy with respect to religious monuments.
1 This article was originally published in David Gilmartin and Bruce B. Lawrence,
eds., Beyond Turk and Hindu: Rethinking Religious Identities in Islamicate
South Asia (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2000).

Much of the contemporary evidence on temple desecration cited
by Hindu nationalists is found in Persian material translated and
published during the rise of British hegemony in India. Especially
influential has been the eight-volume History of India as Told by
Its Own Historians, first published in 1849 and edited by Sir Henry
M. Elliot, who oversaw the bulk of the translations, with the help
of John Dowson. But Elliot, keen to contrast what he understood
as the justice and efficiency of British rule with the cruelty and
despotism of the Muslim rulers who had preceded that rule, was
anything but sympathetic to the "Muhammadan" period of Indian
history. As he wrote in the book's original preface:
The common people must have been plunged into the lowest depths of
wretchedness and despondency. The few glimpses we have, even among
the short Extracts in this single volume, of Hindus slain for disputing with
Muhammadans, of general prohibitions against processions, worship,
and ablutions, and of other intolerant measures, of idols mutilated, of
temples razed, of forcible conversions and marriages, of proscriptions
and confiscations, of murders and massacres, and of the sensuality and
drunkenness of the tyrants who enjoined them, show us that this picture
is not overcharged.²
With the advent of British power, on the other hand, "a more stirring
and eventful era of India's History commences . . . when the full
light of European truth and discernment begins to shed its beams
upon the obscurity of the past." Noting the far greater benefits
that Englishmen had brought to Indians in a mere half century than
Muslims had brought in five centuries, Elliot expressed the hope
that his published translations would "make our native subjects
more sensible of the immense advantages accruing to them under
the mildness and the equity of our rule."4 Elliot's motives for
delegitimizing the Indo-Muslim rulers who had preceded English
rule are thus quite clear. Writing on the pernicious influence that
this understanding of premodern Indian history had on subsequent
generations, the eminent historian Mohammad Habib once
remarked, "The peaceful Indian Mussalman, descended beyond
doubt from Hindu ancestors, was dressed up in the garb of a

foreign barbarian, as a breaker of temples, and an eater of beef, and
declared to be a military colonist in the land where he had lived
for about thirty or forty centuries. . . . The result of it is seen in
the communalistic atmosphere of India today." Although penned
many years ago, these words are especially relevant in the context
of current controversies over the history of temple desecration in
India. For it has been through a selective use of Elliot and Dowson's
selective translations of premodern Persian chronicles, together
with a selective use of epigraphic data, that Hindu nationalists have
sought to find the sort of irrefutable evidence-one of Sita Ram
Goel's chapters is entitled "From the Horse's Mouth"- that would
demonstrate a persistent pattern of villainy and fanaticism on the
part of premodern Indo-Muslim conquerors and rulers.
In reality, though, each scrap of evidence in the matter requires
careful scrutiny. Consider an inscription dated 1455 and found
over the doorway of a tomb-shrine in Dhar, Madhya Pradesh,
formerly the capital of Malwa. The inscription, a Persian ghazal
of forty-two verses, mentions the destruction of a Hindu temple
by one 'Abdullah Shah Changal during the reign of Raja Bhoja, a
renowned Paramara king who ruled over the region from 1010 to
1053. In Hindu Temples: What Happened to Them? Goel accepts
      the inscription's reference to temple destruction more or less at
      face value, as though it were a contemporary newspaper account
      reporting an objective fact.6 Unlike Goel, however, the text is
      concerned not with documenting an instance of temple destruction
      but with narrating and celebrating the fabulous career of 'Abdullah
      Shah Changal, the saint who is buried at Dhar. A reading of a larger
      body of the text reveals, in fact, a complex historiographical process
      at work:
      This centre became Muhammadan first by him \[i.e., 'Abdullah Shah
      Changal\], (and) all the banners of religion were spread. (I have heard)
      that a few persons had arrived before him at this desolate and ruined
      place. When the muazzin raised the morning cry like the trumpet-call
      for the intoxicated sufis, the infidels (made an attack from) every wall
      (?) and each of them rushed with the sword and knife. At last they (the

infidels) wounded those men of religion, and after killing them concealed
(them) in a well. Now this (burial place and) grave of martyrs remained
a trace of those holy and pious people.
When the time came that the sun of Reality should shine in this dark
and gloomy night, this lion-man \['Abdullah Shah Changal\] came from
the centre of religion to this old temple with a large force. He broke the
images of the false deities, and turned the idol-temple into a mosque.
When Rai Bhoj saw this, through wisdom he embraced Islam with the
family of all brave warriors. This quarter became illuminated by the
light of the Muhammadan law, and the customs of the infidels became
obsolete and abolished.
Now this tomb since those old days has been the famous pilgrimage-
place of a world. Graves from their oldness became leveled (to the
ground), (and) there remained no mount on any grave. There was also
(no place) for retirement, wherein the distressed darvish could take
rest. Thereupon the king of the world gave the order that this top of Tur
\[Mount Sinai\] be built anew. The king of happy countenance, the Sultan
of horizons (i.e., the world), the visitors of whose courts are Khaqan (the
emperor of Turkistan) and Faghfur (the emperor of China), 'Ala-ud-din
Wad-dunya Abu'l-Muzaffar, who is triumphant over his enemies by the
grace of God, the Khilji king Mahmud Shah, who is such that by his
justice the world has become adorned like paradise, he built afresh this
old structure, and this house with its enclosure again became new.?
The narrative divides a remembered past into three distinct
moments. The first is the period before the arrival of the Hero,
'Abdullah Shah Changal. At this time a small community of
Muslims in Malwa, with but a tenuous foothold in the region, were
martyred by local non-Muslims, their bodies thrown into a well. The
narrative's second moment is the period of the Hero, who comes
from the "centre of religion" (Mecca?), smashes images, transforms
the temple into a mosque, and converts to Islam the most famous
king of the Paramara dynasty- deeds that collectively avenge the
martyred Sufis and (re)establish Islam in the region. The narrative's
third moment is the period after the Hero's lifetime when his grave,
although a renowned place of pilgrimage, has suffered from neglect.
Now enters the narrative's other hero, Sultan Mahmud Khalaji, the
"king of the world" and "of happy countenance," to whose court
the emperors of China and Central Asia pay respect, and by whose

justice the world has become adorned like paradise. His great act
was to patronize the cult of 'Abdullah Shah by (re)building his
shrine, which we are told at text's end included a strong vault, a
mosque, and a caravanserai. The inscription closes by offering a
prayer that the soul of the benevolent sultan may last until Judgment
Day and that his empire may last in perpetuity.
Although Indo-Muslim epigraphs are typically recorded
soon after the events they describe, the present one is hardly
contemporary, as it was composed some four hundred years after
the events to which it refers. Far from being a factual account of
a contemporary incident, then, the text presents a richly textured
legend elaborated over many generations of oral transmission
until 1455, when the story of 'Abdullah Shah Changal and his
deeds in Malwa became frozen in the written word that we have
before us. As such, the narrative reveals a process by which a
particular community at a particular time and place-Muslims in
mid-fifteenth-century Malwa-constructed their origins. Central to
the story are themes of conversion, martyrdom, redemption, and
the patronage of sacred sites by Indo-Muslim royalty, as well as,
of course, the destruction of a temple. Whether or not any temple
was actually destroyed four hundred years before this narrative was
committed to writing, we cannot know with certainty. However,
it would seem no more likely that such a desecration had actually
occurred than that the renowned Raja Bhoja had been converted
to Islam, which the text also claims.
In any event, it is clear that by the mid-fifteenth century the
memory of the destruction of a temple, projected into a distant past,
had become one among several elements integral to how Muslims
in Malwa-or at least those who patronized the composition of
this ghazal-had come to understand their origins. The case thus
suggests that caution is necessary in interpreting claims made in
Indo-Muslim literary sources to instances of temple desecration. It
also illustrates the central role that temple desecration played in the
remembered past of an Indo-Muslim state or community.

Early Instances of Temple Desecration
It is well known that, during the two centuries before 1192, which
was when an indigenous Indo-Muslim state and community first
appeared in North India, Persianized Turks systematically raided
and looted major urban centers of North India, hauling immense
loads of movable property to power bases in eastern Afghanistan.³
The pattern commenced in 986, when the Ghaznavid sultan,
Sabuktigin (r. 977-997), attacked and defeated the Hindu Shahi
raja who controlled the region between Kabul and northwest
Punjab. According to Abu Nasr 'Utbi, the personal secretary to the
sultan's son, Sabuktigin "marched out towards Lamghan \[located
to the immediate east of Kabul\], which is a city celebrated for its
great strength and abounding in wealth. He conquered it and set
fire to the places in its vicinity which were inhabited by infidels,
and demolishing the idol-temples, he established Islam in them.'
Linking religious conversion with military conquest-with
conquest serving to facilitate conversion, and conversion to
legitimize conquest-'Utbi's brief notice established a rhetorical
trope that many subsequent Indo-Muslim chroniclers would repeat,
as for example in the case of the 1455 inscription at Dhar, just
discussed.
"⁹9
Notwithstanding 'Utbi's religious rhetoric, however, subsequent
invasions by Sabuktigin and his more famous son, Mahmud
of Ghazni (r. 998-1030), appear to have been undertaken for
purely material reasons. Based in Afghanistan and never seeking
permanent dominion in India, the earlier Ghaznavid rulers raided
and looted Indian cities, including their richly endowed temples
loaded with movable wealth, with a view to financing their larger
political objectives far to the west in Khurasan.10 The predatory
nature of these raids was also structurally integral to the Ghaznavid
political economy: their army was a permanent, professional one
built around an elite core of mounted archers who, as slaves, were
purchased, equipped, and paid with cash derived from regular

infusions of war booty taken alike from Indian and Iranian cities.¹¹
From the mid-eleventh century, however, Mahmud's successors, cut
off from their sources of military manpower in Central Asia first by
the Seljuqs and then by the Ghurids, became progressively more
provincial, their kingdom focused around their capital of Ghazni
in eastern Afghanistan with extensions into the Punjab. And, while
the later Ghaznavids continued the predatory raids of the Indian
interior for booty, these appear to have been less destructive and
more sporadic than those of Sabuktigin and Mahmud.12
The dynamics of North Indian politics changed dramatically,
however, when the Ghurids, a dynasty of Tajik (eastern Iranian)
origins, arrived from central Afghanistan toward the end of the
twelfth century. Sweeping aside the Ghaznavids, Ghurid conquerors
and their Turkish slave generals ushered in a new sort of state quite
unlike that of the foreign-based Ghaznavids. Aspiring to imperial
dominion over the whole of North India from a base in the middle
of the Indo-Gangetic plain, the new Delhi Sultanate signaled the
first attempt to build an indigenous Indo-Muslim state and society
in North India. With respect to religious policy, we can identify two
principal components to this project: (a) state patronage of an India-
based Sufi order, and (b) a policy of selective temple desecration
that aimed not, as earlier, to finance the military machine of a vast
and distant empire but to delegitimize and extirpate defeated Indian
ruling houses. Let us consider these in turn.
Sufism and State Building
"The world is bound up closely with that of the men of faith,"
wrote the Bahmani court poet 'Abd al-Malik 'Isami in 1350. "In
every country, there is a man of piety who keeps it going and well.
Although there might be a monarch in every country, yet it is
actually under the protection of a fakir \[Sufi shaikh\]."13 Here we
find a concise statement of the medieval Perso-Islamic conception
of how religion and politics interrelate. In 'Isami's view, what had
saved the Delhi Sultanate from Mongol conquest was the respect

showed by Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq (r. 1325-51) for the
memory of the founder of the Chishti order in India, Shaikh Mu'in
al-Din Chishti (d. 1236), to whose tomb in Ajmer the sultan had
made a pilgrimage just after engaging with a Mongol army. 14 'Isami
also felt, however, that the decline of Delhi, and of the Tughluq
empire generally, had resulted in large part from the demise in
1325 of Nizam al-Din Auliya, Delhi's most renowned shaikh.
Conversely, he considered that the arrival in the Deccan of one of
Nizam al-Din Auliya's leading spiritual successors, Burhan al-Din
Gharib (d. 1337), was the cause of that region's flourishing state
at mid-century. 15
Among all South Asian Sufi orders, the Chishtis were the most
closely identified with the political fortunes of Indo-Muslim states,
and especially with the planting of such states in parts of South Asia
never previously touched by Islamic rule. The pattern began in the
first several decades of the fourteenth century, when the order's
rise to prominence among Delhi's urban populace coincided with
that of the imperial Tughluqs. The two principal Persian poets in
India of that time, Amir Hasan and Amir Khusrau, and the leading
historian, Zia al-Din Barani, were all disciples of Nizam al-Din
Auliya. As writers whose works were widely read, these men were
in effect publicists for Nizam al-Din and his order. And since the
three were also patronized by the Tughluq court, the public and the
ruling classes alike gradually came to associate dynastic fortune
with that of the Chishti order.16 Moreover, as the spiritual power
of a charismatic Sufi was believed to adhere to his tomb, shrines
at such tombs were patronized by Indo-Muslim rulers just as they
were frequented by Muslim devotees. And since the tomb-shrines
of the greatest shaikhs of this order were located within South Asia,
and not in distant Central Asia or the Middle East as was the case
with those of other orders, a ruling dynasty's patronage of Chishti
shrines could bolster its claims to being both legitimately Islamic
and authentically Indian.

Thus Chishti shaikhs repeatedly participated in the launching
of new Indo-Muslim states. At the core of 'Isami's narrative of the
Bahmani Revolution, which in 1347 successfully threw off Tughluq
overlordship and launched an independent Indo-Muslim state in the
Deccan, is a narrative of the passing of the Prophet Muhammad's
own mantle (khirqa) from Abu Bakr, the first caliph, down to Burhan
al-Din Gharib's leading disciple, Zain al-Din Shirazi (d. 1369). It
was from that very mantle-"by whose scent one could master
both worlds"-that the founder of the Bahmani Sultanate, Sultan
Hasan Bahman Shah (r. 1347-58), was said to have received his own
power and inspiration.¹7 We see the same pattern in Bengal, another
former Tughluq province that asserted its independence from Delhi
in the mid-fourteenth century. The earliest known monument built
by the founder of Bengal's Ilyas Shahi dynasty (1342-1486) was a
mosque dedicated in 1342 to Shaikh 'Ala al-Haq (d. 1398), a Sufi
shaikh whose own spiritual master was-like Zain al-Din's spiritual
• master-a disciple of Nizam al-Din Auliya (d. 1325). What is more,
the political ascendancy of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty coincided exactly
with the spiritual ascendancy of Shaikh 'Ala al-Haq and his own
family. Down to the year 1532, fully fourteen successive sultans
of Bengal enlisted themselves as disciples of the descendants of
this shaikh, while the tomb-shrine of 'Ala al-Haq's own son and
successor, Nur Qutb-i 'Alam, became in effect a state shrine to
which subsequent sultans made annual pilgrimages.18
In short, within the space of just five years, between 1342 and
1347, founders of independent Indo-Muslim dynasties in both
Bengal and the Deccan patronized local Chishti shaikhs whose own
spiritual masters had migrated from Delhi, where they had studied
with the imperial capital's preeminent Sufi shaikh, Nizam al-Din
Auliya. The pattern was repeated elsewhere, as the Tughluq empire
continued to crumble, giving rise to more provincial successor-
states. In 1396, the Tughluq governor of Gujarat, Muzaffar Khan,
proclaimed his independence immediately after marching to Ajmer,
where he paid his devotions to the tomb of Mu'in al-Din Chishti,

the "mother-shrine" of the Chishti order in India.19 In 1404, soon
after proclaiming his own independence from Delhi, the former
Tughluq governor of Malwa, Dilawar Khan, described himself as
"the disciple of the head of the holy order of Nasir Din Mahmud."20
The reference here was to Nizam al-Din Auliya's most eminent
disciple to have remained in Delhi-Shaikh Nasir al-Din Mahmud
(d. 1356), over whose grave Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq (r. 1351-88)
had raised a magnificent tomb several decades earlier.21
Nor did the pattern cease with the launching of Tughluq
successor states. On entering Delhi in 1526, Babur prayed at the
shrine of India's second great Chishti shaikh, Bakhtiyar Kaki (d.
1235), and the new emperor's brother-in-law rebuilt the tomb of
Nizam al-Din Auliya. In 1571 Akbar built a tomb for his father,
Humayun, near Nizam al-Din's shrine and in the same year began
building his new capital of Fatehpur Sikri at the hospice-site
of Salim Chishti, the shaikh who had predicted the birth of the
emperor's son. Toward the end of his life, this same shaikh tied his
turban on the head of that son, the future Jahangir, and pronounced
him his spiritual successor. As emperor himself, Jahangir built gates
and other buildings at or near the foundational Chishti shrine at
Ajmer, as did Shah Jahan as part of his victory celebrations after
defeating the raja of Mewar. That emperor's daughter, Jahan Ara,
even wrote a biography of Mu'in al-Din Chishti. Shah Jahan's
son and successor, Aurangzeb, who sought to build another pan-
Indian empire on the Tughluq model, visited and made sizable
contributions to Chishti tombs in former Tughluq provinces such
as at Gulbarga or Khuldabad, in addition to tombs in Ajmer and
Delhi. Even the later Mughals patronized those Chishti shrines to
which they still had access in their dwindling domains, as when
'Alamgir II repaired and made additions to the tomb of Nizam
al-Din Auliya. Bringing the pattern full circle, the last Mughal
emperor, Bahadur Shah II (deposed 1858), built his own mansion
adjacent to the shrine of Bakhtiyar Kaki, the very site where Babur
had prayed more than three centuries earlier.22

In sum, rulers of the entire Mughal dynasty, believing that
the blessings of Chishti shaikhs underpinned their worldly
success, vigorously patronized the order. Two of Akbar's fourteen
pilgrimages to the shrine of Mu'in al-Din Chishti at Ajmer, those
of 1568 and 1574, were made immediately after conquering Chittor
and Bengal, respectively. 23 Discussing his military successes with
the historian 'Abd al-Qadir Badauni, Akbar remarked, "All this
(success) has been brought through the Pir \[Mu'in al-Din\]."24
Vividly dramatized by Akbar's pilgrimages from Agra to Ajmer,
several of them made by foot, the Mughal-Chishti partnership even
survived the collapse of the Mughal state. In a sense it persists to this
day. The ceremonies, the terminology, and the protocol still found
at Chishti shrines generally, and at the Ajmer shrine particularly,
reflect the extraordinary intrusion of Mughal courtly culture into
that of the Chishti order.25
Temple Desecration and State Building
By effectively injecting a legitimizing "substance" into a new body
politic, royal patronage of Chishti shaikhs contributed positively
to the process of Indo-Muslim state building. Equally important to
this process was its negative counterpart: the sweeping away of all
prior political authority in newly conquered and annexed territories.
When such authority was vested in a ruler whose own legitimacy
was associated with a royal temple-typically one that housed an
image of a ruling dynasty's state deity, or rastra-devatā (usually
Vishnu or Śiva) -- that temple was normally desecrated, redefined,
or destroyed, any of which would have had the effect of detaching a
defeated raja from the most prominent manifestation of his former
legitimacy. Temples that were not so identified, or temples formerly
so identified but abandoned by their royal patrons and thereby
rendered politically irrelevant, were normally left unharmed. Such
was the case, for example, with the famous temples at Khajuraho
south of the Middle Gangetic Plain, which appear to have been

abandoned by their Candella royal patrons before Turkish armies
reached the area in the early thirteenth century 26
It would be wrong to explain this phenomenon by appealing
to an essentialized "theology of iconoclasm" felt to be intrinsic
to the Islamic religion. While it is true that contemporary Persian
sources routinely condemned idolatry (but-parasti) on religious
grounds, it is also true that attacks on images patronized by enemy
kings had been, from about the sixth century A.D. on, thoroughly
integrated into Indian political behavior. With their lushly sculpted
imagery vividly displaying the mutual interdependence of kings
and gods and the co-mingling of divine and human kingship, royal
temple complexes of the early medieval period were thoroughly
and preeminently political institutions. It was here that, after the
sixth century, human kingship was established, contested, and
revitalized.27 Above all, the central icon housed in a royal temple's
"womb-chamber" and inhabited by the state deity of the temple's
royal patron expressed the shared sovereignty of king and deity.
Moreover, notwithstanding that temple priests endowed a royal
temple's deity with attributes of transcendent and universal power,
that same deity was also understood as having a very special
relationship, indeed a sovereign relationship, with the particular
geographical site in which its temple complex was located.28 As
revealed in temple narratives, even the physical removal of an
image from its original site could not break the link between deity
and geography.29 The bonding between king, god, temple, and
land in early medieval India is well illustrated in a passage from
Brhatsamhita, a text from the sixth century A.D.: "If a Śiva linga,
image, or temple breaks apart, moves, sweats, cries, speaks, or
otherwise acts with no apparent cause, this warns of the destruction
of the king and his territory."30 In short, from about the sixth century
on, images and temples associated with dynastic authority were
considered politically vulnerable.
Given these perceived connections between temples, images, and
their royal patrons, it is hardly surprising that early medieval Indian

history abounds in instances of temple desecration that occurred
amidst interdynastic conflicts. In A.D. 642, according to local
tradition, the Pallava king, Narasimhavarman I, looted the image
of Ganesha from the Chalukyan capital of Vatapi. Fifty years later,
armies of those same Chalukyas invaded North India and brought
back to the Deccan what appear to be images of Ganga and Yamuna,
looted from defeated powers there. In the eighth century, Bengali
troops sought revenge on King Lalitaditya by destroying what
they thought was the image of Vishnu Vaikuntha, the state deity of
Lalitaditya's kingdom in Kashmir. In the early ninth century, the
Rashtrakuta king, Govinda III, invaded and occupied Kanchipuram,
which so intimidated the king of Sri Lanka that he sent Govinda
several (probably Buddhist) images representing the Sinhala state.
The Rashtrakuta king then installed these in a Saiva temple in his
capital. About the same time the Pandyan king, Srimara Srivallabha,
also invaded Sri Lanka and took back to his capital a golden Buddha
image-"a synecdoche for the integrity of the Sinhalese polity
itself" that had been installed in the kingdom's jewel palace. In
the early tenth century, the Pratihara king, Herambapala, seized a
solid gold image of Vishnu Vaikuntha when he defeated the Sahi
king of Kangra. A few years later, the same image was seized from
the Pratiharas by the Candella king, Yasovarman, and installed in
the Lakshmana temple of Khajuraho. In the early eleventh century,
the Chola king, Rajendra I, furnished his capital with images he
had seized from several prominent neighboring kings: Durga and
Ganesha images from the Chalukyas; Bhairava, Bhairavi, and Kali
images from the Kalingas of Orissa; a Nandi image from the Eastern
Chalukyas; and a bronze Śiva image from the Palas of Bengal. In
the mid-eleventh century, the Chola king, Rajadhiraja, defeated the
Chalukyas and plundered Kalyani, taking a large black stone door
guardian to his capital in Thanjavur, where it was displayed to his
subjects as a trophy of war.31
While the dominant pattern here was one of looting royal temples
and carrying off images of state deities,32 we also hear of Hindu

kings destroying the royal temples of their political adversaries. In
the early tenth century, the Rashtrakuta monarch, Indra III, not only
destroyed the temple of Kalapriya (at Kalpa near the Jamuna River),
patronized by the Rashtrakutas' deadly enemies, the Pratiharas, but
they took special delight in recording the fact.33
In short, it is clear that temples had been the natural sites for
the contestation of kingly authority well before the coming of
Muslim Turks to India. Not surprisingly, Turkish invaders, when
attempting to plant their own rule in early medieval India, followed
and continued established patterns. Table 1 (pp. 130-33) gives dates
and places, which are keyed to three maps (pp. 127-29). These
cannot give the complete picture of temple desecration after the
establishment of Turkish power in Upper India. Undoubtedly, some
temples were desecrated, but the facts were never recorded, or the
facts were recorded but the records themselves no longer survive.
Conversely, later Indo-Muslim chroniclers, seeking to glorify the
religious zeal of earlier Muslim rulers, sometimes attributed acts
of temple desecration to such rulers even when no contemporary
evidence supports the claims.34 As a result, we shall never know the
precise number of temples desecrated in Indian history. Nonetheless,
by relying strictly on evidence found in contemporary or near-
contemporary epigraphs and literary evidence spanning more than
five centuries (1192-1729), one may identify eighty instances of
temple desecration whose historicity appears reasonably certain.
Although this figure falls well short of the 60,000 claimed by some
Hindu nationalists,35 a review of these data suggests several broad
patterns.
First, acts of temple desecration were almost invariably carried
out by military officers or ruling authorities; that is, such acts
that we know about were undertaken by the state. Second, the
chronology and geography of the data indicate that acts of temple
desecration typically occurred on the cutting edge of a moving
military frontier. From Ajmer - significantly, also the wellspring of
Chishti piety--the post-1192 pattern of temple desecration moved

swiftly down the Gangetic Plain as Turkish military forces sought to
extirpate local ruling houses in the late twelfth and early thirteenth
centuries (see table 1 and map 1: nos. 1-9). In Bihar, this included
the targeting of Buddhist monastic establishments at Odantapuri,
Vikramasila, and Nalanda. Detached from a Buddhist laity, these
establishments had by this time become dependent on the patronage
of local royal authorities, with whom they were identified. In the
1230s, Iltutmish carried the Delhi Sultanate's authority into Malwa
(nos. 10-11), and by the onset of the fourteenth century the Khalaji
sultans had opened up a corridor through eastern Rajasthan into
Gujarat (nos. 12-14, 16-17).
Delhi's initial raids on peninsular India, on which the Khalajis
embarked between 1295 and the early decades of the fourteenth
century (nos. 15, 18-19), appear to have been driven not by a goal
of annexation but by the Sultanate's need for wealth with which to
defend North India from Mongol attacks.36 For a short time, then,
peninsular India stood in the same relation to the North-namely,
as a source of plunder for financing distant military operations - as
North India had stood in relation to Afghanistan three centuries
earlier, in the days of Mahmud of Ghazni. In 1323, however, a new
North Indian dynasty, the Tughluqs, sought permanent dominion
in the Deccan, which the future Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq
established by uprooting royally patronized temples in western
Andhra (nos. 20-22). Somewhat later Sultan Firuz Tughluq did the
same in Orissa (no. 23).
From the late fourteenth century, as the tide of Tughluq
imperialism had receded from Gujurat and the Deccan, newly
emerging successor states sought to expand their own political
frontiers in those areas. This, too, is reflected in instances of
temple desecration, as the ex-Tughluq governor of Gujarat and
his successors consolidated their authority there (see table 1
and map 2: nos. 25-26, 31-32, 34-35, 38-39, 42), or as the Delhi
empire's successors in the south, the Bahmani sultans, challenged
Vijayanagara's claims to dominate the Raichur doab and the Tamil

coast (nos. 33, 41). The pattern was repeated in Kashmir by Sultan
Sikandar (nos. 27-30) and in the mid-fifteenth century when the
independent sultanate of Malwa contested renewed Rajput power
in eastern Rajasthan after Delhi's authority there had waned (nos.
36-37). In the early sixteenth century, when the Lodi dynasty of
Afghans sought to reassert Delhi's sovereignty over neighboring
Rajput houses, we again find instances of temple desecration
(nos. 43-45). So do we in the later sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries, when the Bahmani kingdom's principal successor states,
Bijapur and Golconda, challenged the territorial sovereignty of
Orissan kings (nos. 55, 59; maps 2 and 3), of Vijayanagara (no.
47), and of the latter's successor states-especially in the southern
Andhra country (nos. 50-51, 53-54, 60-61; maps 2 and 3).
Unlike the Deccan, where Indo-Muslim states had been
expanding at the expense of non-Muslim states, in North India the
Mughals under Babur, Humayun, and Akbar-that is, between 1526
and 1605-grew mainly at the expense of defeated Afghans. As
non-Hindus, the latter had never shared sovereignty with deities
patronized in royal temples, which probably explains the absence
of firm evidence of temple desecration by any of the early Mughals,
in Ayodhya or elsewhere.37 However, when Mughal armies pushed
beyond the frontiers of territories formerly ruled by the Delhi sultans
and sought to annex the domains of Hindu rulers, we again find
instances of temple desecration. In 1661 the governor of Bengal, Mir
Jumla, sacked the temples of the raja of Kuch Bihar, who had been
harassing the northern frontiers of Mughal territory (no. 64; map
3). The next year, with a view to annexing Assam to the imperial
domain, the governor pushed far up the Brahmaputra Valley and
desecrated temples of the Ahom _rajas_, replacing the principal one
at Garhgaon with a mosque (nos. 65-66).
All of these instances of temple desecration occurred in the
context of military conflicts when Indo-Muslim states expanded into
the domains of non-Muslim rulers. Contemporary chroniclers and
inscriptions left by the victors leave no doubt that field commanders,

governors, or sultans viewed the desecration of royal temples as a
normal means of decoupling a Hindu king's legitimate authority
from his former kingdom, and more specifically, of decoupling
that former king from the image of the state deity that was publicly
understood as protecting the king and his kingdom. This was
accomplished in several ways. Most typically, temples considered
essential to the constitution of enemy authority were destroyed.
Occasionally, temples were converted into mosques, which more
visibly conflated the disestablishment of former sovereignty with
the establishment of a new one.38
The form of desecration that showed the greatest continuity
with pre-Turkish practice was the seizure of the image of a
defeated king's state deity and its abduction to the victor's capital
as a trophy of war. In February 1299, for example, Ulugh Khan
sacked Gujarat's famous temple of Somnath and sent its largest
image to Sultan 'Ala al-Din Khalaji's court in Delhi (no. 16; map
1). When Firuz Tughluq invaded Orissa in 1359 and learned that
the region's most important temple was that of Jagannath located
inside the raja's fortress in Puri, he carried off the stone image of
the god and installed it in Delhi "in an ignominious position" (no.
23). In 1518, when the court in Delhi came to suspect the loyalty
of a tributary Rajput chieftain in Gwalior, Sultan Ibrahim Lodi
marched to the famous fortress, stormed it, and seized a brass image
of Nandi evidently situated adjacent to the chieftain's Śiva temple.
Brought back to Delhi, it was installed in the city's Baghdad Gate
(no. 46; map 2). Similarly, in 1579, when Golconda's army, led by
Murahari Rao, was campaigning south of the Krishna River, Rao
annexed the entire region to Qutb Shahi domains and sacked the
popular Ahobilam temple, whose ruby-studded image he brought
back to Golconda and presented to his sultan as a war trophy (no.
51). Although the Ahobilam temple had only local appeal, it had
close associations with prior sovereign authority, since it had been
patronized and even visited by the powerful and most famous king
of Vijayanagara, Krishna Deva Raya.39

In each of these instances, the deity's image, taken as war trophy
to the capital city of the victorious sultan, was radically detached
from its former context and transformed from a living to a dead
image. However, sacked images were not invariably abducted to the
victor's capital. In 1556, the Gajapati raja of Orissa had entered into
a pact with the Mughal emperor, Akbar, the distant adversary of the
sultan of Bengal, Sulaiman Karrani. The raja had also given refuge
to Sulaiman's more proximate adversary, Ibrahim Sur, and offered
to assist the latter in his ambitions to conquer Bengal and overthrow
the Karrani dynasty. As Sulaiman could hardly have tolerated such
threats to his stability, he sent an army into Orissa that went straight
to the Gajapati kingdom's state temple of Jagannath and looted its
images. But here the goal was not annexation but only punishment,
which might explain why the Gajapati state images were not carried
back to the Bengali capital as trophies of war.40
Whatever form they took, acts of temple desecration were never
directed at the people but at the enemy king and the image that
incarnated and displayed his state deity. A contemporary description
of a 1661 Mughal campaign in Kuch Bihar, which resulted in the
annexation of the region, makes it clear that Mughal authorities
were guided by two principal concerns. The first was to destroy the
image of the state deity of the defeated raja, Bhim Narayan. And
the second was to prevent Mughal troops from looting or in any
way harming the general population of Kuch Bihar. To this end,
we are informed that the chief judge of Mughal Bengal, Saiyid
Muhammad Sadiq,
was directed to issue prohibitory orders that nobody was to touch the cash
and property of the people, and he should go personally and establish
order everywhere. He was asked to confiscate the treasure of Bhim
Narayan, break the idols and introduce the laws of Islam. Sayyid Sadiq
issued strict prohibitory orders so that nobody had the courage to break
the laws or to plunder the property of the inhabitants. The punishment for
disobeying the order was that the hands, ears or noses of the plunderers
were cut. Sayyid Sadiq busied himself in giving protection to the life
and property of the subjects and the destitutes.41

In newly annexed areas formerly ruled by non-Muslims, as in the
case of Kuch Bihar, Mughal officers took appropriate measures to
secure the support of the common people, who after all created the
material wealth upon which the entire imperial edifice rested.
Temple Protection and State Maintenance
If the idea of conquest became manifest in the destruction of those
temples associated with former enemies, what happened once the
land and the subjects of those former states became successfully
integrated into an Indo-Muslim state? On this point, the data are
quite clear: pragmatism as well as time-honored traditions of both
Islamic and Indian statecraft dictated that temples lying within such
states be left unmolested. We learn from a Sanskrit inscription, for
example, that in 1326, thirteen years after the northern Deccan
had been annexed to the Tughluq empire, Sultan Muhammad bin
Tughluq appointed Muslim officials to repair a Śiva temple in
Kalyana (in Bidar District), thereby facilitating the resumption of
normal worship that had been disrupted by local disturbances.42
According to that sultan's interpretation of Islamic law, anybody
who paid the poll tax (jizya) could build temples in territories ruled
by Muslims.43
Such views continued to hold sway until modern times. Within
several decades of Muhammad bin Tughluq's death, Sultan Shihab
al-Din (1355-73) of Kashmir rebuked his Brahman minister for
having suggested melting down Hindu and Buddhist images in
his kingdom as a means of obtaining quick cash. In elaborating
his ideas on royal patronage of religion, the sultan referred to the
deeds of figures drawn from classical Hindu mythology. "Some
\[kings\]," he said,
have obtained renown by setting up images of gods, others by worshiping
them, some by duly maintaining them. And some, by demolishing them!
How great is the enormity of such a deed! Sagara became famous by
creating the sea and the rivers.... Bhagiratha obtained fame by bringing
down the Ganges. Jealous of Indra's fame, Dushyanata acquired renown
by conquering the world; and Rama by killing Ravana when the latter

had purloined Sita. King Shahvadina \[Shihab al-Din\], it will be said,
plundered the image of a god; and this fact, dreadful as Yama \[death\],
will make the men in future tremble.44
About a century later, Muslim jurists advised the future Sikandar
Lodi of Delhi (r. 1489-1517) that "it is not lawful to lay waste
ancient idol temples, and it does not rest with you to prohibit
ablution in a reservoir which has been customary from ancient
times."45
The pattern of post-conquest temple protection, and even
patronage, is especially clear when we come to the imperial
Mughals, whose overall views on the subject are captured in official
pronouncements on Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, one of the most
controversial figures in Indian history. It is well known that in the
early eleventh century, before the establishment of Indo-Muslim
rule in North India, the Ghaznavid sultan had made numerous, and
very destructive, attacks on the region. Starting with the writings
of his own contemporary and court poet, Firdausi (d. 1020),
Mahmud's career soon became legend, as generations of Persian
poets lionized Mahmud as a paragon of Islamic kingly virtue,
celebrating his infamous attacks on Indian temples as models for
what other pious sultans should do.46 But the Ghaznavid sultan
never undertook the responsibility of actually governing any part of
the subcontinent whose temples he so wantonly plundered. Herein
lies the principal difference between the careers of Mahmud and
Abu'l-Fazl, Akbar's chief minister and the principal architect of
Mughal imperial ideology. Reflecting the sober values that normally
accompany the practice of governing large, multi-ethnic states,
Abu'l-Fazl attributed Mahmud's excesses to fanatical bigots who,
having incorrectly represented India as "a country of unbelievers at
war with Islam," incited the sultan's unsuspecting nature, which led
to "the wreck of honour and the shedding of blood and the plunder
of the virtuous."47
Indeed, from Akbar's time (r. 1556-1605) forward, Mughal
rulers treated temples lying within their sovereign domain as state

property; accordingly, they undertook to protect both the physical
structures and their Brahman functionaries. At the same time, by
appropriating Hindu religious institutions to serve imperial ends-a
process involving complex overlappings of political and religious
codes of power-the Mughals became deeply implicated in
institutionalized Indian religions, in dramatic contrast to their British
successors, who professed a hands-off policy in this respect. Thus
we find Akbar allowing high-ranking Rajput officers in his service
to build their own monumental temples in the provinces to which
they were posted.48 His successors went further. Between 1590 and
1735, Mughal officials repeatedly oversaw, and on occasion even
initiated, the renewal of Orissa's state cult, that of Jagannath in Puri.
By sitting on a canopied chariot while accompanying the cult's
annual car festival, Shah Jahan's officials ritually demonstrated
that it was the Mughal emperor, operating through his appointed
officers (manşabdar), who was the temple's-and hence the god's-
ultimate lord and protector.49 Such actions in effect projected a
hierarchy of hybridized political and religious power that descended
from the Mughal emperor to his manşabdar, from the manşabdar
to the god Jagannath and his temple, from Jagannath to the sub-
imperial king who patronized the god, and from the king to his
subjects. For the Mughals, politics within their sovereign domains
never meant annihilating prior authority. It meant appropriating
authority within a hierarchy of power that flowed from the Peacock
Throne to the mass of commoners below.
Such ideas continued into the reign of Aurangzeb (1658-1707),
whose orders to local officials in Benares in 1659 clearly indicate
that Brahman temple functionaries there, together with the temples
at which they officiated, merited state protection:
In these days information has reached our court that several people
have, out of spite and rancor, harassed the Hindu residents of Benares
and nearby places, including a group of Brahmans who are in charge
of ancient temples there. These people want to remove those Brahmans
from their charge of temple-keeping, which has caused them considerable
distress. Therefore, upon receiving this order, you must see that nobody

unlawfully disturbs the Brahmans or other Hindus of that region, so that
they might remain in their traditional place and pray for the continuance
of the Empire.50
By way of justifying this order, the emperor noted, "According to
the Holy Law and the exalted creed, it has been established that
ancient temples should not be torn down." On this point, Aurangzeb
aligned himself with the theory and practice of Indo-Muslim
ruling precedent. But then he added, "Nor should new temples
be built"-a view that broke decisively from Akbar's policy of
permitting his Rajput officers to build their own temple complexes
in Mughal territory.51 Although this order appears to have applied
only to Benares-many new temples were built elsewhere in India
during Aurangzeb's reign52-one might wonder what prompted the
emperor's anxiety in this matter.
Temple Desecration and State Maintenance
It seems certain that Indo-Muslim rulers were well aware of the
highly charged political and religious relationship between a royal
Hindu patron and his client-temple. Hence, even when former rulers
or their descendants had been comfortably assimilated into an Indo-
Muslim state's ruling class, there always remained the possibility,
and hence the occasional suspicion, that a temple's latent political
significance might be activated and serve as a power base to further
its patron's political aspirations. Such considerations might explain
why it was that, when a subordinate non-Muslim officer in an
Indo-Muslim state showed signs of disloyalty-and especially if he
engaged in open rebellion-the state often desecrated the temple(s)
most clearly identified with that officer. After all, if temples lying
within its domain were viewed as state property, and if a government
officer who was also a temple's patron demonstrated disloyalty to
the state, from a juridical standpoint ruling authorities felt justified
in treating that temple as an extension of the officer and hence liable
for punishment.

Thus in 1478, when the Bahmanis' garrison in Kondapalle
mutinied, murdered its governor, and entrusted the fort to Bhimraj
Oriyya, who until that point had been a Bahmani client, the sultan
personally marched to the site and, after a six-month siege, stormed
the fort, destroyed its temple, and built a mosque on the site (no. 40).
A similar event occurred in 1659, when Shivaji Bhonsle, the son of
a loyal and distinguished officer serving the 'Adil Shahi sultans of
Bijapur, seized a government port on the northern Konkan coast,
thereby disrupting the flow of external trade to and from the capital.
Responding to what it considered an act of treason, the government
deputed a high-ranking officer, Afzal Khan, to punish the Maratha
rebel. Before marching to confront Shivaji himself, however, the
Bijapur general first proceeded to Tuljapur and desecrated a temple
dedicated to the goddess Bhavani, to which Shivaji and his family
had been personally devoted (no. 63; map 3).
We find the same pattern with the Mughals. In 1613 while at
Pushkar, near Ajmer, Jahangir ordered the desecration of an image
of Varaha that had been housed in a temple belonging to an uncle
of Rana Amar of Mewar, the emperor's arch enemy (see table 1
and map 3: no. 56). In 1635 his son and successor, Shah Jahan,
destroyed the great temple at Orchha, which had been patronized
by the father of Raja Jajhar Singh, a high-ranking Mughal officer
who was at that time in open rebellion against the emperor (no.
58). In 1669, there arose a rebellion in Benares among landholders,
some of whom were suspected of having helped Shivaji, who was
Aurangzeb's arch enemy, escape from imperial detention. It was
also believed that Shivaji's escape had been initially facilitated
by Jai Singh, the great-grandson of Raja Man Singh, who almost
certainly built Benares's great Vishvanath temple. It was against
this background that the emperor ordered the destruction of that
temple in September 1669 (no. 69).53 About the same time, serious
Jat rebellions broke out in the area around Mathura, in which the
patron of that city's congregational mosque had been killed. So in
early 1670, soon after the ringleader of these rebellions had been

captured near Mathura, Aurangzeb ordered the destruction of the
city's Keshava Deva temple, and he built an Islamic structure
('idgāh) on its site (no. 70).54 Nine years later, the emperor ordered
the destruction of several prominent temples in Rajasthan that had
become associated with imperial enemies. These included temples
in Khandela patronized by refractory chieftains there, temples
in Jodhpur patronized by a former supporter of the emperor's
brother and arch rival, and the royal temples in Udaipur and Chitor
patronized by Rana Raj Singh after it was learned that that Rajput
chieftain had withdrawn his loyalty to the Mughal state (nos. 71-
74).
Considerable misunderstanding has arisen from a passage in the
Ma'athir-i 'Alamgiri concerning an order on the status of Hindu
temples that Aurangzeb issued in April 1669, just months before his
destruction of the Benares and Mathura temples. The passage has
been construed to mean that the emperor ordered the destruction
not only of the Vishvanath temple at Benares and the Keshava Deva
temple at Mathura but of all temples in the empire.55 The passage
reads as follows: "Orders respecting Islamic affairs were issued to
the governors of all the provinces that the schools and places of
worship of the irreligious be subject to demolition and that with the
utmost urgency the manner of teaching and the public practices of
the sects of these misbelievers be suppressed."56 The order did not
state that schools or places of worship be demolished; rather, it said
that they were subject to demolition, implying that local authorities
were required to make investigations before taking action.
More important, the sentence immediately preceding this passage
provides the context in which we may find the order's overall intent.
On 8 April 1669, Aurangzeb's court received reports that in Thatta,
Multan, and especially in Benares, Brahmans in "established
schools" (mudāris-i muqarrar) had been engaged in teaching false
books (kutub-i bățila) and that both Hindu and Muslim "admirers
and students" had been traveling over great distances to study the
"ominous sciences" taught by this "deviant group."57 We do not

know what sort of teaching or "false books" were involved here,
or why both Muslims and Hindus were attracted to them, although
these are intriguing questions. What is clear is that the court was
primarily concerned, indeed exclusively concerned, with curbing
the influence of a certain mode of teaching (taur-i dars-o-tadrīs)
within the imperial domain. Far from being, then, a general order
for the immediate destruction of all temples in the empire, the order
was responding to specific reports of an educational nature and was
targeted at investigating those institutions where a certain kind of
teaching had been taking place.
In sum, apart from his prohibition on building new temples in
Benares, Aurangzeb's policies respecting temples within imperial
domains generally followed those of his predecessors. Viewing
temples within their domains as state property, Aurangzeb and Indo-
Muslim rulers in general punished disloyal Hindu officers in their
service by desecrating temples with which they were associated.
How, one might then ask, did they punish disloyal Muslim officers?
Since officers in all Indo-Muslim states belonged to hierarchically
ranked service cadres, infractions short of rebellion normally
resulted in demotions in rank, while serious crimes like treason were
generally punished by execution, regardless of the perpetrator's
religious affiliation.58
No evidence, however, suggests that ruling authorities attacked
public monuments like mosques or Sufi shrines that had been
patronized by disloyal or rebellious officers. Nor were such
monuments desecrated when one Indo-Muslim kingdom conquered
another and annexed its territories. To the contrary, new rulers were
quick to honor and support the shrines of those Chishti shaikhs
that had been patronized by those they had defeated. As we have
seen, Babur, upon seizing Delhi from the last of the city's ruling
sultans, lost no time in patronizing the city's principal Chishti tomb-
shrines. The pattern was repeated as the Mughals expanded into
the provinces formerly ruled by Muslims. Upon conquering Bengal
in 1574, the Mughals showered their most lavish patronage on the

two Chishti shrines in Pandua-those of Shaikh 'Ala al-Haq (d.
1398) and Shaikh Nur Qutb-i 'Alam (d. 1459)- which had been the
      principal object of state patronage by the previous dynasty of Bengal
      sultans.59 And when he extended Mughal dominion over defeated
      Muslim states of the Deccan, the dour Aurangzeb, notwithstanding
      his reputation for eschewing saint cults, made sizable contributions
      to those Chishti shrines in Khuldabad and Gulbarga that had helped
      legitimize earlier Muslim dynasties there.
      Temples and Mosques Contrasted
      Data presented in the foregoing discussion suggest that mosques
      or shrines carried very different political meanings than did royal
      temples in independent Hindu states or temples patronized by Hindu
      officers serving in Indo-Muslim states. For Indo-Muslim rulers,
      building mosques was considered an act of royal piety, even a
      duty. But all actors, rulers and ruled alike, seem to have recognized
      that the deity worshiped in mosques or shrines had no personal
      connection with a Muslim monarch. Nor were such monuments
      thought of as underpinning, far less actually constituting, the
      authority of an Indo-Muslim king. This point is illustrated in a
      reported dispute between the emperor Aurangzeb and a Sufi named
      Shaikh Muhammadi (d. 1696). As a consequence of this dispute,
      in which the shaikh refused to renounce views that the emperor
      considered theologically deviant, Shaikh Muhammadi was ordered
      to leave the imperial domain. When the Sufi instead took refuge in
      a local mosque, Aurangzeb claimed that this would not do, since
      the mosque was also within imperial territory. But the shaikh only
      remarked on the emperor's arrogance, noting that a mosque was the
      house of God and therefore only His property. The standoff ended
      with the shaikh's imprisonment in Aurangabad fort-property that
      was unambiguously imperial.60
      This incident suggests that mosques in Mughal India, though
      religiously potent, were considered detached from both land
      and dynastic authority and hence politically inactive. As such,

their desecration could have had no relevance to the business of
disestablishing a regime that had patronized them. Not surprisingly,
then, when Hindu rulers established their authority over territories
of defeated Muslim rulers, they did not as a rule desecrate mosques
or shrines, as when Shivaji established a Maratha kingdom on the
ashes of Bijapur's former dominions in Maharashtra, or when
Vijayanagara annexed the former territories of the Bahmanis or their
successors.61 In fact, the _rajas_ of Vijayanagara, as is well known,
built their own mosques, evidently to accommodate the sizable
number of Muslims employed in their armed forces.
By contrast, monumental royal temple complexes of the early
medieval period were considered politically active, inasmuch as the
state deities they housed were understood as expressing the shared
sovereignty of king and deity over a particular dynastic realm.62
Therefore, when Indo-Muslim commanders or rulers looted the
consecrated images of defeated opponents and carried them off to
their own capitals as war trophies, they were in a sense conforming
to customary rules of Indian politics. Similarly, when they destroyed
a royal temple or converted it into a mosque, ruling authorities
were building on a political logic that they knew placed supreme
political significance on such temples. That same significance, in
turn, rendered temples just as deserving of peacetime protection as
it rendered them vulnerable in times of conflict.
Temple Desecration and the Rhetoric of State Building
Much misunderstanding over the place of temple desecration in
Indian history results from a failure to distinguish the rhetoric
from the practice of Indo-Muslim state formation. Whereas the
former tends to be normative, conservative, and rigidly ideological,
the latter tends to be pragmatic, eclectic, and non-ideological.
Rhetorically, we know, temple desecration figured very prominently
in Indo-Muslim chronicles as a necessary and even meritorious
constituent of state formation.63 In 1350, for example, the poet-
chronicler 'Isami gave the following advice to his royal patron, 'Ala

al-Din Hasan Bahman Shah, the founder of the Bahmani kingdom
in the Deccan: "If you and I, O man of intellect, have a holding
in this country and are in a position to replace the idol-houses by
mosques and sometimes forcibly to break the Brahmanic thread
and enslave women and children-all this is due to the glory of
Mahmud \[of Ghazni\].... The achievements that you make today
will also become a story tomorrow."64 But the new sultan appears
to have been more concerned with political stability than with the
glorious legacy his court poet would wish him to pursue. There is
no evidence that he converted any temples to mosques. After all,
by carving out territory from lands formerly lying within the Delhi
Sultanate, the founder of the Bahmani state had inherited a domain
void of independent Hindu kings and hence void, too, of temples
that might have posed a political threat to his fledgling kingdom.
Unlike temple desecration or the patronage of Chishti shaikhs,
both of which appear in the contemporary rhetoric on Indo-Muslim
state building, a third activity, the use of explicitly Indian political
rituals, occupied no place whatsoever in that rhetoric. Here we
may consider the way Indo-Muslim rulers used the rich political
symbolism of the Ganges River, whose mythic associations with
imperial kingship had been well established since Mauryan times
(321-181 B.C.). Each in its own way, the mightiest imperial
formations of the early medieval peninsula-the Chalukyas, the
Rashtrakutas, and the Cholas-claimed to have "brought" the
Ganges River down to their southern capitals, seeking thereby
to legitimize their claims to imperial sovereignty. Although the
Chalukyas and the Rashtrakutas did this symbolically, probably
through their insignia, the Cholas literally transported pots of
Ganges water to their southern, capital.65 And, we are told, so did
Muhammad bin Tughluq in the years after 1327, when that sultan
established Daulatabad, in Maharashtra, as the new co-capital of the
Delhi Sultanate's vast, all-India empire.66 In having Ganges water
carried a distance of forty days' journey from North India "for his
own personal use," the sultan was conforming to an authentically

Indian imperial ritual. Several centuries later, the Muslim sultans of
Bengal, on the occasion of their own coronation ceremonies, would
wash themselves with holy water that had been brought to their
capital from the ancient holy site of Ganga Sagar, located where the
Ganges River emptied into the Bay of Bengal.67 No Indo-Muslim
chronicle or contemporary inscription associates the use of Ganges
water with the establishment or maintenance of Indo-Muslim states.
We hear this only from foreign visitors: an Arab traveler in the case
of Muhammad bin Tughluq, a Portuguese friar in the case of the
sultans of Bengal. Similarly, the image of a Mughal official seated
in a canopied chariot and presiding over the Jagannath car festival
comes to us not from Mughal chronicles but from an English
traveler who happened to be in Puri in 1633.68 Such disjunctures
between the rhetoric and the practice of royal sovereignty also
appear, of course, with respect to the founding of non-Muslim
states. We know, for example, that Brahman ideologues, writing
in chaste Sanskrit, spun elaborate tales of how warriors and sages
founded the Vijayanagara state by combining forces for a common
defense of dharma from assaults by barbaric (mleccha) Turkic
outsiders. This is the Vijayanagara of rhetoric, a familiar story.
But the Vijayanagara of practical politics rested on very different
foundations, which included the adoption of the titles, the dress,
the military organization, the ruling ideology, the architecture, and
the political economy of the contemporary Islamicate world.69 As
with Indo-Muslim states, we hear of such practices mainly from
outsiders-merchants, diplomats, travelers-and not from Brahman
chroniclers and ideologues.
Conclusion
One often hears that between the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries,
Indo-Muslim states, driven by a Judeo-Islamic "theology of
iconoclasm," by fanaticism, or by sheer lust for plunder, wantonly
and indiscriminately indulged in the desecration of Hindu temples.
Such a picture cannot, however, be sustained by evidence from

original sources for the period after 1192. Had instances of temple
desecration been driven by a "theology of iconoclasm," as some
have claimed,70 such a theology would have committed Muslims
in India to destroying all temples everywhere, including ordinary
village temples, as opposed to the strategically selective operation
that seems actually to have taken place. Rather, the original data
associate instances of temple desecration with the annexation of
newly conquered territories held by enemy kings whose domains
lay in the path of moving military frontiers. Temple desecrations
also occurred when Hindu patrons of prominent temples committed
acts of treason or disloyalty to the Indo-Muslim states they
served. Otherwise, temples lying within Indo-Muslim sovereign
domains, viewed normally as protected state property, were left
unmolested.
Finally, it is important to identify the different meanings that
Indians invested in religious monuments and the different ways
these monuments were understood to relate to political authority.
In the reign of Aurangzeb, Shaikh Muhammadi took refuge in a
mosque believing that the structure-being fundamentally apolitical,
indeed above politics- lay beyond the Mughal emperor's reach.
Contemporary royal temples, on the other hand, were understood as
highly charged political monuments, a circumstance that rendered
them fatally vulnerable to outside attack. Therefore, by targeting for
desecration those temples that were associated with defeated kings,
conquering Turks, when they made their own bid for sovereign
domain in India, were subscribing to, even while they were
exploiting, indigenous notions of royal legitimacy. Contemporary
Sanskrit inscriptions never identified Indo-Muslim invaders in
terms of their religion, as Muslims, but most generally in terms
of their linguistic affiliation (most typically as Turk, "turushka").
That is, they were construed as but one ethnic community in India
amidst many others.71 In the same way, B. D. Chattopadhyaya
locates within early medieval Brahmanical discourse an "essential
urge to legitimize" any ruling authority so long as it was effective

and responsible. This urge was manifested, for example, in the
perception of the Tughluqs as legitimate successors to the Tomaras
and Cahamanas; of a Muslim ruler of Kashmir as having a lunar,
Pandava lineage; or of the Mughal emperors as supporters of
Ramarajya (the "kingship of Lord Rama").72 It is likely that Indo-
Muslim policies of protecting temples within their sovereign
domains contributed positively to such perceptions.
In sum, by placing known instances of temple desecration
in the larger contexts of Indo-Muslim state building and state
maintenance, one can find patterns suggesting a rational basis for
something commonly dismissed as irrational, or worse. These
patterns also suggest points of continuity with Indian practices that
had become customary well before the thirteenth century. Such
points of continuity in turn call into serious question the sort of
civilizational divide between India's "Hindu" and "Muslim" periods
first postulated in British colonial historiography and subsequently
replicated in both Pakistani and Hindu nationalist schools.
Finally, this essay has sought to identify the different meanings
that contemporary actors invested in the public monuments they
patronized or desecrated, and to reconstruct those meanings on the
basis of the practice, and not just the rhetoric, of those actors. It is
hoped that the approaches and hypotheses suggested here might
facilitate the kind of responsible and constructive discussion that
this controversial topic so badly needs.

    of Ray in 1029 brought him 500,000 dinars' worth of jewels, 260,000 dinars
    in coined money, and over 30,000 dinars' worth of gold and silver vessels.
    India, however, possessed far more wealth than the more sparsely populated
    Iranian plateau. Somnath alone brought in twenty million dinars' worth of
    spoil. C. E. Bosworth, The Ghaznavids: Their Empire in Afghanistan and

    governor of Lahore. "He marched out with his warriors and the army of
    Lahore," wrote Baihaqi, "and exacted ample tribute from the Thakurs. He

crossed the river Ganges and went down the left bank. Unexpectedly (na-gah)
he arrived at a city which is called Banaras, and which belonged to the territory
of Gang. Never had a Muslim army reached this place.... The markets of the
drapers, perfumers, and jewelers were plundered, but it was impossible to do
more. The people of the army became rich, for they all carried off gold, silver,
perfumes, and jewels, and got back in safety." Baihaqi, Tarikh-i Baihaqi, in

25. It has been noted recently that the qawwalt protocols observed during the
    annual 'urs ceremonies at Ajmer, which commemorate the death of Mu'in
    al-Din Chishti, "betray the impact of Mughal court etiquette. The diwan,
    dressed in Mughal fashion, represents in fact the Mughal king rather than a
    religious dignitary, and comes escorted by the torch-bearers and mace-bearers
    wearing Mughal costumes. He takes his seat on the cushion (gadela) under a
    special tent (dalbadal) erected for the occasion....On his arrival in the shrine
    the diwan kisses the tomb and offers flowers, and then one of the khadims,
    who happens to be his wakil, like the other pilgrims, ties a dastar (turban) over
    his head, spreads the cloth sheet over his bowed head, prays for him, and then
    gives him tabarruk, consisting of flowers, sandal and sweets....Then he \[the
    diwan\] sits down and the fatiha khwans, who are permanently and hereditarily
    employed, recite the fatiha, as well as prayers for the sovereign (badshah-i
    Islam), the diwan, the mutawalli and other officials, and for the general public."

    of Ajmer" in Christian Troll, ed., Muslim Shrines in India: Their Character,
    History, and Significance (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1989), 72,74.

27. "The need to link one's royal origins to religious and divine forces led to
    the extraordinary temple building of this period." B. D. Chattopadhyaya,

    circa A.D. 700-1200," in Vishakha N. Desai and Darielle Mason, eds., Gods,
    Guardians, and Lovers: Temple Sculptures from North India, A.D. 700-1200
    (New York: Asia Society Galleries, 1993), 40.
28. Michael Willis suggests that one of the reasons the imperial Pratiharas did not
    build great monumental temple complexes was precisely their determination to
    avoid the localization of sovereign power that temples necessarily projected.
    According to this reasoning, the most active patrons of temple construction
    in this period were subordinate kings who did not have such vast imperial
    pretensions as did the Pratiharas. Willis, "Religion and Royal Patronage in
    North India," in Desai and Mason, eds., Gods, Guardians, and Lovers, 58-
59.
29. Richard H. Davis, Lives of Indian Images (Princeton: Princeton University
    Press, 1997), 122, 137-38. Davis here cites David D. Shulman: "A divine power
    is felt to be present naturally on the spot. The texts are therefore concerned
    with the manner in which this presence is revealed and with the definition of
    its specific attributes." Shulman, Tamil Temple Myths: Sacrifice and Divine
    Marriage in the South Indian Saiva Tradition (Princeton: Princeton University
    Press, 1980), 48. Emphasis mine.

31. Davis, Lives, 51-83, passim. The same pattern continued after the Turkish
    conquest of India. In the 1460s, Kapilendra, the founder of the Suryavamshi
    Gajapati dynasty in Orissa, sacked both Saiva and Vaishnava temples in
    the Kaveri delta in the course of wars of conquest in the Tamil country. See
    Phillip B. Wagoner, Tidings of the King: A Translation and Ethnohistorical
    Analysis of the Raya-vacakamu (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1993),
146. Somewhat later, in 1514, Krishna Deva Raya looted an image of Bala
     Krishna from Udayagiri, which he had defeated and annexed to his growing
     Vijayanagara state. Six years later he acquired control over Pandharpur, where
     he seems to have looted the Vittala image and carried it back to Vijayanagara,
     with the apparent purpose of ritually incorporating this area into his kingdom.
     Davis, Lives, 65, 67.
32. In the late eleventh century, the Kashmiri king, Harsha, even raised the
    plundering of temples to an institutionalized activity, and in the late twelfth
    and early thirteenth centuries, while Turkish rulers were establishing their rule
    in North India, kings of the Paramara dynasty were attacking and plundering
    Jain temples in Gujarat. See Romila Thapar, Harbans Mukhia, and Bipan
    Chandra, Communalism and the Writing of Indian History (Delhi: People's
    Publishing House, 1969), 14, 31.

34. In 1788, for example, the author of the Riyaz al-Salatin claimed that
    Muhammad Bakhtiyar demolished local temples after he conquered Bengal
    in 1204, although no contemporary evidence suggests that he did so. Ghulam
    Hussain Salim, Riyaz us-Salatin: A History of Bengal, trans. Abdus Salam
    (1903; reprint, Delhi: Idarah-i Adabiyat-i Delli, 1975), 64. Even contemporary
    sources could make false claims. An inscription on a mosque in Bidar, dated
    1670, claims that the Mughal governor, Mukhtar Khan, had destroyed a
    temple and built the mosque on its site. "But as a matter of fact," noted the

37. The notion, that Babur's officer Mir Baqi destroyed a temple dedicated to
    Rama's birthplace at Ayodhya and then got the emperor's sanction to build a
    mosque on the site-the notorious Baburi Masjid-was elaborated in 1936

by S. K. Banerji. However, the author offered no evidence that there had ever
been a temple at this site, much less that it had been destroyed by Mir Baqi. The
mosque's inscription records only that Babur had ordered the construction of
the mosque, which was built by Mir Baqi and was described as "the place of
descent of celestial beings" (mahbit-i qudsiyan). This commonplace rhetorical
flourish in Persian can hardly be construed as referring to Rama, especially
since it is the mosque itself that is so described, and not the site or any earlier
structure on the site. See S. K. Banerji, "Babur and the Hindus," Journal of
the United Provinces Historical Society 9 (1936): 76-83.
38. For example, a 1406 inscription records that after Sultan Firuz Shah Bahmani
    had defeated the forces of Vijayanagara in the much-contested Raichur doab
    region, "a mosque has been converted out of a temple as a sign of religion."
    It then records that the sultan himself had "conquered this fort by the firm
    determination of his mind in a single attack (lit. on horseback). After the
    victory, the chief of chiefs, Safdar (lit. the valiant commander) of the age,
    received (the charge of) the fort." _Epigraphia Indica_, Arabic and Persian

58. Consider the swift and brutal punishment of Baha al-Din Gurshasp, a high-
    ranking officer in Tughluq imperial service and a governor in the Deccan.
    In 1327, Gurshasp joined forces with the raja of Kampila in an unsuccessful
    rebellion against Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq. When captured, the raja,
    who had never sworn allegiance to Tughluq authority, got the relatively light
    punishment of a beheading. But the rebel governor, who was not only a former
    Tughluq officer but the emperor's first cousin, was spat upon by his female
    relatives and flayed alive; then his skin was stuffed with straw and paraded
    throughout the imperial provinces as a cautionary tale to the public, while his
    body was mixed with rice and fed to elephants. See 'Isami, Futuhu's-Salatin,
    trans., 3:658-89; Mahdi Husain, trans., The Rehla of lbn Battuta (India, Maldive
    Islands, and Ceylon) (Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1953), 96. As a final indignity
    to Gurshasp, we are told by Ibn Battuta that the elephants refused to eat the
    meal that had been mixed with the rebel's body.

61. Examples of mosque desecrations are strikingly few in number. In 1697-98
    in Sambhar, in Rajasthan's Jaipur District, Shah Sabz 'Ali built a mosque on
    the site of a temple. In the reign of Shah Alam (1707-12), however, non-
    Muslims came to dominate the region and demolished the mosque, which
    was subsequently rebuilt in the reign of Farrukh Siyar. See Z. A. Desai,
    Published Muslim Inscriptions of Rajasthan (Jaipur, 1971), 157. Similarly,
    there is evidence that in 1680, during Aurangzeb's invasion of Rajasthan, the
    Rajput chief Bhim Singh, seeking to avenge the emperor's recent destruction
    of temples in Udaipur and elsewhere, raided Gujarat and plundered Vadnagar,
    Vishalnagar, and Ahmedabad, in the latter place destroying thirty smaller
    mosques and one large one. See Raja-sumudra-prasasti, ch. 22, verse 29, an
    inscription composed ca. 1683, which appears in Shyamaldas Kaviraj, Vir
    Vinod (Udaipur: Rajayantralaya, 1886); cited in R. C. Majumdar, ed., The
    Mughal Empire (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1974), 351.
62. One can hardly imagine the central focus of a mosque's ritual activity, the
    prayer niche (mihrab), being taken out of the structure and paraded around a
    Muslim capital by way of displaying Allah's co-sovereignty over an Indo-Mus-
    lim ruler's kingdom, in the manner that the ritual focus of a royal temple, the
    image of the state deity, was paraded around many premodern Hindu capitals
    in elaborate car festivals.
63. Aiming to cast earlier invaders or rulers in the role of zealous and puritanical
    heroes, later chroniclers occasionally attributed to such figures the desecration
    of staggering numbers of temples. Mahmud of Ghazni, for example, is said to
    have destroyed 10,000 temples in Kanauj and 1,000 in Mathura, his grandson

Ibrahim 1,000 in the Delhi Doab and another 1,000 in Malwa, Aibek 1,000 in
Delhi, and Muhammad Ghuri another 1,000 in Benares-figures that Hindu
nationalists like Sita Ram Goel have accepted at face value. Goel, Hindu

ISLAM, ICONOCLASM AND THE
EARLY INDIAN MOSQUE
FINBARR B. FLOOD
1. Introduction¹
   Most accounts of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the
   former Taliban regime of Afghanistan invoked the widespread idea
   that Muslims are implacably hostile to figural imagery, situating the
   demise of the Buddhas within a long culturally determined tradition
   of image destruction. Despite abundant evidence for the espousal
   of figural art in many parts of the Islamic world from the time of
   the Prophet onwards, in both scholarly and popular discourse,
   'Islamic iconoclasm' generally refers to a quasi-pathological
   aversion to figuration that is assumed to be an essential and enduring
   characteristic of Islamic culture, and that is particularly directed
   towards the religious images of the non-Muslim 'Other'. In this
   1 An earlier version of this paper was submitted for publication in Anne
   McClanan & Jeffrey Johnson (eds.), Negating the Image: Case Studies of Past
   Iconoclasms (Ashgate Press) in the spring of 2002. Both papers are based on
   a talk presented to the symposium Exploring the Frontiers of Islamic Art at
   MIT, Cambridge, Mass., in May 2001. An extended discussion of the issues
   raised here will appear in my forthcoming book on the Ghurids and South Asia.
   The observations offered here are based on a very brief visit to the mosques
   undertaken in 1999, and are therefore of a preliminary nature.

way, acts of iconoclasm undertaken by Muslims (as opposed to
Christians, for example) are generally held to be primarily the
product of a religious compulsion underwritten by a timeless
theology of images, and only secondarily motivated by economic
or political factors, if at all.
Such assumptions negate the role of Muslim iconoclasts as
historical agents (Ernst 2000:116), obscure the specific socio-
political circumstances in which image destruction occurred, and
elide regional and historical differences in attitudes to figuration.
Those who represented the fate of the Buddhas as the inevitable
product of a cultural fixation with images, for example, ignored the
fact that they had been celebrated as wonders by Muslim writers
for almost a millennium before their destruction. In doing so, they
obviated the need to explain what specific changes in the culture
and politics of the region (and beyond) had led to the events of
March 2001. The ahistoricism that follows from the naturalization
of historical acts not only makes for bad scholarship, but reinforces
essentialist constructions of Islam that can have a profound political
impact in the present.
Among the many problems with traditional constructions of
'Islamic iconoclasm' that one could highlight, this paper focuses
on the complex interplay between creation and destruction that
characterizes many iconoclastic interventions. It is specifically
concerned with the aesthetic implications of iconoclasm in the first
mosques constructed after the Muslim conquest of north India in the
late twelfth century. Based on empirical observation, it challenges
the assumed linkage between the negation of Hindu and Jain images
that appeared on architectural elements reused in the construction of
the mosques, and the rejection of the artistic traditions which they
are assumed to embody. In doing so, it seeks to demonstrate the need
for further empirical research on the subject and a re-evaluation of
the conceptual framework within which the relationship between
Islam, Muslims and images has been articulated.

2. Iconoclasm
   in the Islamic World
   The opposition to figuration in Islam is based not on any Qur'anic
   injunction, but on various Traditions of the Prophet, the Hadith
   (Paret 1960; Paret 1968; van Reenen, 1990), whose proscriptions
   are reinforced by historical accounts of idol-destruction after the
   conversion of pagan sanctuaries in Arabia for Muslim use (Flood
   2002). The two principal objections to figuration in the proscriptive
   texts are a concern with usurping divine creative powers (Paret
   1960: 43-44; Wensinck\[-Fahd\] 1997: 889), and fear of shirk,
   polytheism and idolatry (Hawting 1999: 22, 49). There is a general
   consensus in the Traditions forbidding all representations that have
   shadows (whose defacement is obligatory), and some schools of
   thought go so far as to liken artists to polytheists (Wensinck-\[Fahd\]
   1997: 889-90). Such proscriptions were undoubtedly a factor in
   promoting aniconism, or the avoidance of figural imagery (Grabar
   1977:51), but their impact varied widely in time and place. Attitudes
   towards figuration could change over time, or with the advent of
   new political regimes with different cultural values.
   If attitudes towards figuration in the medieval Islamic world
   were far from homogenous or monolithic, it is within the context
   of ritual or sacred space that the proscriptions on figuration had
   their greatest effect. Although detailed studies of figural ornament
   in medieval Islamic religious architecture are few and far between
   (Anatolia being an unusual exception), it is fairly consistently
   avoided in the decoration of medieval mosques and madrasas.
   In those mosques where figural ornament did appear (e.g. Pope
   1946; Roux 1980), it was generally eschewed in the area around
   the prayer-niche (mihrab), but even here there are exceptions.
   Such exceptions include pre-Islamic monuments converted for use
   as mosques, in which figural ornament was sometimes left intact
   (Pedersen 1991: 650).
   In addition to the promotion of aniconism (at least at a normative
   or ideal level), the proscriptions on figuration led to a lingering
   unease that could motivate acts of iconoclasm (the destruction or

mutilation of existing figural imagery) by pious individuals or,
more rarely, the medieval state. Such iconoclastic moments might
target either the symbols of the 'Other' and/or the art produced
during the reigns of Muslim predecessors (Flood 2002, 645). The
Hadith offer at least two practical strategies for iconoclasts: perhaps
surprisingly, both fall short of total obliteration. Images could either
be re-contextualized in a manner that made clear that they were in
no way venerated (by reusing figural textiles as floor cushions, for
example) or, alternatively, they might be decapitated, so that they
became inanimate, that is, devoid of a soul or raḥ (Paret 1960: 46-47;
Paret 1976-77: 158, 176; van Reenen 1990: 33, 54). To judge from
both textual evidence and surviving objects, these strategies were
frequently employed by medieval iconoclasts in the Islamic world
(Flood 2002). In many cases defacement (or the mutilation of the
affective parts of face such as the eyes and nose) often substituted
for decapitation, a practice that finds precedents in early accounts
of Prophet Muhammad's iconoclastic activities (Faris 1952: 27).
In both manuscript painting and metalwork, a line was sometimes
drawn across the throat in a symbolic decapitation (e.g. Petrosyan
et al. 1995: 144-55). Occasionally, ritual defilement substituted for
physical alteration and was evidently considered sufficient to negate
or neutralize the image. It is important to note that such practices
are by no means peculiar to the Islamic world: the same focus on
the head and face characterizes the work of late antique, medieval
and early modern iconoclasts in Europe (Freedberg 1989: 415),
where a work of art might "be 'damaged' rather than 'destroyed' in
order to make it a token of the violence it was subjected to and of
the infamy of anything with which it is associated (Gamboni 1997:
19)." The continued existence of such ritually 'destroyed' images
suggests that the dichotomy between creation and destruction that
underlies much writing on Islamic iconoclasm offers too reductive
a reading of iconoclastic practice. This is the case with the Indian
mosques that form the subject of this paper.

3. Iconoclasm and the Early Indian Mosque
   There are few areas of the Islamic world where the issue of
   Islamic iconoclasm has proved as contentious as in South Asia.
   In traditional South Asian historiography of the colonial and post-
   colonial periods, the invasions of predominantly Hindu northern
   India by the armies of Muslim sultans based in Afghanistan during
   the eleventh and twelfth centuries are characterized as pitting a
   monolithic indigenous iconophilia against an equally homogeneous
   Islamic iconophobia, resulting in the destruction of temples and the
   looting and desecration of religious icons.
   Curiously, discussions of Islamic iconoclasm in South Asia
   have tended to focus on its least tangible aspect, the now vanished
   portable images whose histories are known primarily through
   medieval texts (Davis 1997: 88-113). This focus on the intangible
   reflects a larger historical problem in the study of medieval South
   Asian cultures, namely the preeminence afforded texts, which
   frequently provide the lens through which even material remains of
   the medieval period are viewed (Patel 2000: 325-58; Kumar 2001:
   172). Thus, the much more quantifiable evidence for iconoclasm
   offered by the alteration of images that appeared on architectural
   elements from Hindu temples reused in certain medieval Indian
   mosques has escaped detailed examination. Nevertheless, despite
   the lack of detailed study, the alterations have generally been taken
   as corroborating textual accounts of a virulent culturally determined
   iconoclasm,² with devastating consequences in the present.
   The destruction of the sixteenth-century Babri Mosque at
   Ayodhya in 1992, which sparked violent inter-communal rioting,
   2 See, for example, André Wink's analysis of Islamic iconoclasm, in which he
   cites the destruction of (unnamed) religious monuments in modern Bangladesh
   and Pakistan as exemplifying the phenomenon seen in twelfth-century India
   (Wink 1997: 323). There is no discussion of the very different cultural and
   historical circumstances in which these acts occurred (Partition or the rise of
   the nation state, for example), and questions of motive and agency are obscured
   by the assertion of a timeless, theologically motivated cultural compulsion. For
   a critique of the same phenomenon in relation to Bamiyan see Flood (2002).

was justified by the belief that a temple that once stood on the
site had been destroyed by Muslim iconoclasts to make way for
the mosque (Guha-Thakurta 1997). Those seeking to provide a
rationale for this act of contemporary iconoclasm, and to prepare the
ground for future destruction, have drawn directly on colonial and
post-colonial scholarship on Indo-Islamic monuments (e.g. Goel
1993). As others have noted, within such scholarship architectural
forms, and even their component elements, have traditionally been
categorized in ways that assign them fixed sectarian identities as
'Buddhist', 'Hindu' or 'Muslim.' Consequently, the very presence of
'Hindu' material in mosques is assumed to corroborate the generic
references to temple destruction that pepper medieval Arabic and
Persian textual histories, with little further investigation (Asher
2000: 122; Patel 2000: 311-22; Flood 2001: 155; Kumar 2001:
175).3 However unwitting, the resulting complicity of scholarship
on early Islamic architecture in South Asia in the current wave of
anti-Muslim iconoclasm at contested sites is directly proportional
to its continuing willingness to embrace the essentialist paradigm
of Islamic iconoclasm discussed at the outset.
This paradigm is particularly evident in published discussions of
the mosques built in the later twelfth and early thirteenth centuries
(roughly between 1175 and 1205), after much of northern India was
brought under the control of an eastern Iranian dynasty of Muslim
rulers based at Ghur in central Afghanistan. This radical change
in the political configuration of South Asia has usually been seen
as bringing about a profound rupture in the cultural fabric of the
region, the product of a clash between two mutually opposed and
incommensurate cultural traditions. Articulated within discussions
of the mosques built after the conquest, discussions often
strongly colored by issues of colonialism, nationalism, religious
fundamentalism, and race (Flood unpublished; Kumar 2001), the
3 There are some notable exceptions to this general tendency. See, for example,
Lehmann 1978.

question of responses to the image, and to religious imagery in
particular, have served as a touchstone for this division.
At least four mosques built in the wake of the conquest
survive. Two of these, the Qutbi mosque at Delhi and the Arhai-
din-ka Jhompra Mosque at Ajmer in Rajasthan, bear foundation
inscriptions giving respective dates of 587/1192 and 596/1199
(Horovitz 1911-12: 13, 15; Hillenbrand 1988). The inscriptions
of the Delhi mosque inform us that it was built by the Turkish
commander Qutb al-Din Aybak on the orders of the Ghurid sultan,
Muhammad b. Sam \[r. 1163-1203\] (Horovitz 1911-12: 14; Page
1926: 29). A third mosque, the Shahi-Masjid at Khatu in Rajasthan,
is provided with a mihrab (prayer-niche) of virtually identical form
to that in the Ajmer mosque, and can be confidently dated to the
turn of the twelfth century (Shokoohy & Shokoohy 1993: 107).
Finally, the Chaurasi Khamba mosque at Kaman, in the Bayana
region of Rajasthan can be ascribed to the patronage of another
Turkish commander of the Ghurids, Baha al-Din Tughrul, some
time between 1195 and 1210, when he ruled as governor (Shokoohy
& Shokoohy 1987).
The basic form of these stone monuments is similar in each case
with a monumental projecting entrance (often elevated) leading to a
central courtyard with a multi-bayed prayer-hall at its western end
and, at Delhi and Kaman, a narrow arcade or riwaq surrounding the
remaining three sides. The interior spaces are covered by means of
corbeled domes and flat slabs supported on trabeate beams borne
by pillars composed of discrete sections set vertically on end to
achieve the required height. Many (but not all) of these elements
have been reused from earlier pre-conquest monuments.
Based on a number of common features, including the use of
spolia and their location on what are believed to be the sites of
former temples, it has been suggested that such mosques constitute
a distinct type, recently dubbed the "conquest mosque," which is
associated with the expansion of the frontiers of Islamicate South
Asia (Wagoner & Rice 2001: 89-90). The stone mosques built by

Hindu craftsmen for communities of Muslims living in Sind and
Gujarat in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, before the Ghurid
conquest, make no use of spolia (eg. Shokoohy 1988). Such
craftsmen were surely available in major urban centers such as
Ajmer and Delhi after the conquest and, as we will see, may even
have been involved in the construction of Ghurid mosques from
reused materials. The use of spolia even when alternatives were
available thus seems to represent a deliberate choice. The fact that
the same pattern is repeated later, with mosques of similar form
also constructed from spolia built immediately after the conquest
of different Indian regions by the Delhi sultans in the 13th and
14th centuries, points to a relationship between the construction of
such mosques from spolia and successful campaigns of conquest
(Wagoner & Rice 2001: 90-105).
Dale Kinney has noted of spolia in another context that "how the
spolia were acquired must have been a principal determinant of how
they were originally perceived (Kinney 1995: 57)." In the existing
discourse on the early Indian mosque, the converse is also true: how
the use of spolia is perceived often colors assumptions about the
contexts in which they were acquired. In published discussions of
the Indo-Ghurid mosques the reused material is either assumed to
come from desecrated temples, or the contentious issue of source is
side-stepped by attributing the use of spolia rather generically and
vaguely to their abundance (Patel 2000: 270). It seems probable
that the truth lies somewhere in between. As the range of styles
represented in the material indicates, not all the material reused
in Indo-Ghurid mosques is of the same date: in fact, some of the
material pre-dates the Ghurid conquest by several centuries (Meister
1993: 448). Although not strictly orthodox, the reuse of earlier
architectural material was known in north Indian temples (Wink
1997: 322; Dhaky 1998: 127). The reuse of material does not of
itself offer evidence for temple desecration, therefore, since some
of this material may have been available from ruined structures
including (but not restricted to) temples. Other of the spolia reused

in the Indo-Ghurid mosques come from more recent structures,
however, and their abundance seems to reflect a policy of selective
desecration during periods of conquest and military expansion.
Although the phenomenon of iconoclasm in pre-conquest South
Asia is usually considered a cultural anomaly, and has therefore
never been systematically studied, both image destruction and
temple desecration were practiced by 'Hindu' kings before the
advent of the Ghurids. Just as divergent attitudes to images existed
within Islam, Buddhist, Hindu and Jain images were contested
between different sects and faiths in South Asia, sometimes leading
to the desecration and destruction of portable icons, or the erasure
and mutilation of images in temples and shrines (Golzio 1990;
Thapar 1994: 16-18; Wink 1997: 310-11; Flood forthcoming).
Other instances of pre-conquest iconoclasm occurred at times of
military conquest or political change, and may be seen as reflecting
the close inter-relationships between centers of political and
religious authority in medieval South Asia. In addition to image
destruction, medieval South Asian rulers of the pre-conquest period
also desecrated the temples of those that they defeated far more
frequently than one might imagine from published discussions of
the early Indian mosque (Eaton 2000: 256; Flood forthcoming).
In a recent study of those instances of temple desecration by
invading Muslim armies that can be reliably documented, Richard
Eaton concludes that "temples had been the natural sites for the
contestation of kingly authority well before the coming of the
Muslim Turks to India," therefore, "by targeting for desecration
those temples that were associated with defeated kings, conquering
Turks, when they made their own bid for sovereign domain in
India, were subscribing to, even while they were exploiting,
indigenous notions of royal legitimacy" (Eaton 2000: 256, 270).
As in the pre-Ghurid period, in many cases these were not random
acts of destruction, but represented a selective desecration of
shrines identified as the power bases of defeated rivals, whose
tutelary images were often carried off for display in the victor's

capital (Davis 1997: 51-87; Eaton 2000: 256). As an instrument
of state policy this practice finds parallels in the practices of pre-
conquest Indian rulers. Along with the looting and destruction of
religious images, temple desecration therefore appears to have been
phenomena of the expanding frontier in pre-Ghurid South Asia. It
therefore seems likely that the employment of spolia in the early
mosques derives from a complex interweaving of political and
economic pragmatism (depriving a rival of the source of his political
power, while profiting from the resulting availability of architectural
materials). A similar intention can be detected behind the looting
of temple elements by pre-conquest Indian kings, who carried the
materials off to be incorporated into their own dynastic shrines
(Dayalan 1985: 136). This is not to elide important differences
in the nuances and political consequences of iconoclastic acts in
northern India before and after the Ghurid conquest (Kumar 2001:
159, 161), although even here cultural difference has frequently
been over-emphasized (Flood 2002: 650-51; Flood forthcoming),
but to emphasize that the principle of image destruction, temple
desecration and the reuse of architectural elements in the context of
military conquest was by no means as alien to pre-conquest South
Asia as is often assumed.
4. Iconoclasm as an Anti-Aesthetic Gesture
   Perhaps because of its implied associations with conquest and
   victory, the reuse of architectural members in Indo-Ghurid mosques
   has been read as a derogation of 'Indian' tradition, a negative
   response to the aesthetics of the temple and its emphasis on
   figuration. In one of the earliest reports on the Quwwat al-Islam or
   Qutbi Mosque, the Ghurid Friday mosque of Delhi (1192 onwards),
   the antiquarian Alexander Cunningham noted in 1863 that,
   The general effect of these large rows of made-up columns is certainly
   rich and pleasing; but this effect is due to the kindly hand of time, which
   has almost entirely removed the coating of plaster with which the whole

of these beautifully sculptured pillars were once barbarously covered by
the idol-hating Musalmâns (Cunningham 1871: 177).
The question of aesthetic value was thus inversely linked to the
iconoclastic impulse in scholarly discourse on this key monument
from its inception. This linkage is related to a much broader art
historical tendency to privilege originary works over those created
from their components (Kinney 1995: 55; Patel 2000: 236). In terms
of the Indo-Ghurid mosque, that originary work consists of both
the assumed material source, the despoliated temple from which
components are drawn, and the conceptual source, the eastern
Iranian mosque to which the early Indian mosques are often assumed
to be crude (and aesthetically alien) approximations (Welch 1993:
314). In what follows, I want to suggest ways of looking at the
Indo-Ghurid mosque that transcend the tendency to privilege some
implied original (whether material temple or conceptual mosque),
considering the Indo-Ghurid mosque not as a random collection
of mutilated fragments, but as a Gesamtkunstwerk, and examining
the role of iconoclasm in its creation.
Let us turn to the first two of Cunningham's propositions: that
the images carved on the reused pillars were covered, hence no
aesthetic value was placed on the pillars. The iconoclastic practices
envisioned by Cunningham - a spree of image mutilation followed
by a swift dose of whitewash - not only have a distinctly Protestant
feel to them, but are based on a number of erroneous assumptions.
In fact, somewhat ironically, any desire to obscure the decoration
of the reused pillars seems to have been subordinated to aesthetic
considerations, for the "pleasing effect" that Cunningham noted
in the rows of reused pillars was deliberately orchestrated by
those responsible for the mosque's construction. At key points
in the mosque - around the opening of the eastern entrance onto
the courtyard for example - the gray, yellow, and red stones from
which the mosque was constructed are arranged so that these colors
alternate in horizontal bands. Similar effects were orchestrated by

those who arranged the stones reused in the Ghurid Friday Mosque
at Ajmer, and the mosque at Kaman in Rajasthan, where one also
finds alternating courses of richly carved gray, red and yellow
stone. In the careful juxtaposition of different colored stones we
see here in embryonic form the polychromatic aesthetic beloved of
certain early sultanate monuments, among them the Ala'i-Darwaza
at the Qutbi Complex in Delhi. The antecedents of the tradition lie,
however, in the pre-conquest temple architecture of north India,
where similar arrangements of structural stones to form horizontal
bands of polychromy are sometimes found.
The espousal of lithic polychromy is among a number of features
common to both temple and mosque, despite the reconfiguration
of visual idioms in the latter (Meister 1993: 449). This continuity
of tradition suggests that craftsmen trained to build temples were
later involved in the construction of Ghurid mosques from their
components. Even if these components were plastered in the post-
Ghurid period, the care taken to achieve such effects only makes
sense if the pillars were seen and not obscured beneath a coat of
plaster when the mosque was built in the twelfth century.
The assertion that the images on the structural members of
the Delhi mosque were obscured is thus contradicted by the most
cursory examination of the monument, and would appear to be
based solely on the belief that images must have been so offensive
to the patrons of the mosque that they could not possibly have
remained visible. A variant on this idea holds that the figures
depicted on reused material were mutilated in "a rather feeble and
crude attempt to render the human form unrecognizable" (Grover
1981:6). Just how feeble, may be seen from the fact that clearly
recognizable anthropomorphic figures are to be found throughout
4 There are in fact many examples of Indian mosques in which richly carved
reused elements that were originally exposed were later plastered over (e.g.
Shokoohy & Shokoohy 2000: 62, figs. 10-11). Even if whitewashed later, the
images were not necessarily obscured: both temples and mosques could be
whitewashed annually in India without obscuring (or, without any intention
to obscure) their decoration.

the mosque (e.g. figure 2). Nevertheless, changes have been made
to many of the anthropomorphic representations in this and other
Ghurid mosques. In the majority of cases these alterations are
restricted to the most anthropomorphic features, predominantly
facial features such as eyes and noses (figures 1-3), thereby
conforming to iconoclastic practice in other areas of the medieval
Islamic world (Flood 2002).
Assuming that the majority of the alterations to the images in
the Delhi mosque were made at the time that the pillars were reused
in the late twelfth century (and broad parallels with the patterns of
iconoclasm found in other Indo-Ghurid mosques would seem to
support this), we are dealing with something much more than a
visceral response to the image. The scale of the undertaking suggests
a considerable investment of time and labor: one might even speak
of an economics of iconoclasm. Other case studies indicate that the
iconoclastic process can be bureaucratic, calculated, and protracted
(Bahrani 1995: 367): in the case of the materials reused in Delhi
and elsewhere it must have extended over a certain time frame, days
at least. We are not dealing therefore with an immediate emotional
reaction, but with what appears to have been an orchestrated
program of alteration directly related to that which governed the
collection and re-assembly of existing architectural materials.
As already noted, it is probable that craftsmen trained in the
temple tradition were responsible for the construction of many, if
not all, Indo-Ghurid mosques. It is therefore conceivable, if not
provable, that these same craftsmen were responsible for altering
the figures on reused pillars at the behest of their Ghurid patrons.
Many instances of Islamic iconoclasm' appear to be the product of
a negotiation between iconoclasts and iconophiles, with the latter
modifying existing images either for financial remuneration, or to
prevent more extensive alterations by those opposed to figuration
5 The mosques at Ajmer and Khatu, which are closely related in terms of their
decoration, also represent the most radical expression of both an aniconic and
iconoclastic impulse that is much more muted in Delhi and Kaman.

(e.g. Schick 1995: 218-9; Flood, forthcoming). Physical damage
to religious icons was considered to preclude their veneration in
medieval Hinduism (Davis 1992: 52), a fact noted in medieval
Arabic references to Indian iconolatry (Said 1989: 78). In pre-
modern societies, iconoclasts frequently considered such physical
transformations more effective in neutralizing or negating images
if they were undertaken by those who had formerly worshipped
or otherwise made use of the altered images. The alteration of the
relatively minor deities found on the architectural elements reused
in Indo-Ghurid mosques may therefore have functioned as a mode
of de-consecration desirable to both Muslim patrons and Hindu
craftsmen for different reasons. If the impetus for neutralizing the
images came from the patrons of these monuments, the range of
ways in which images are altered (from the uncommon total erasure
to the ubiquitous gouging of the face: figures 1 & 2) suggests that
the specific ways in which it was to be effected were left to the
individual craftsman.
Once again, such investment of resources in the relatively minor
alterations to the figural imagery only makes sense if those images
were originally visible in their altered state and not obscured beneath
a layer of stucco. One therefore gets the impression that the alteration
of anthropomorphic images derived not from a desire to obscure
them, but from a need to neutralize them in a manner that accorded
with both textual prescriptions and established iconoclastic practice.
This need was contingent upon the decision to reuse pre-carved
elements bearing figural ornament in the construction of a mosque.
This being so, it is useful to attempt to distinguish here between
instrumental iconoclasm, in which a particular action is executed
in order to achieve a greater goal, and expressive iconoclasm, in
which the desire to express one's beliefs or give vent to one's
feelings is achieved by the act itself (Gregory 1994: 89). In these
early Indian mosques, the use of decapitation and defacement by
Muslim iconoclasts represents a type of instrumental iconoclasm,
for it permitted the survival of pre-existing images in the prescribed

way (albeit in altered form) as part of a larger whole. Although
the product of changes in attitudes within a religious community
rather than shifts in cultural values stemming from political change,
an analogous phenomenon may underlie the erasure of images in
the Late Antique synagogues of Palestine, which one scholar has
ascribed to "the desire to keep using a mosaic or appurtenance
after the communal aesthetic changed from one of tolerance for
images to one of lessened tolerance or even hostility toward them
(Fine 2000: 190)."
Within the post-conquest north Indian mosques, there is little
sense that the reuse of temple elements represents a derogation
of the Indic traditions that they represent, although this has been
generally assumed and frequently asserted. On the contrary, as the
careful alternation of colored stones in certain places indicates,
established pre-conquest conventions continued to govern the
reuse of pre-existing elements, which by and large conforms to the
architectural grammar of the Indian temple (Meister 1993: 448).
Even elements featuring figural ornament were used right side up in
prominent contexts (above exterior window openings, for example
\[Page 1926: pl. 9c; Dikshit 1944\]), while iconoclastic alterations
to such figural scenes were relatively restrictive in nature, and did
not involve all figures equally, as we shall see shortly. In Ajmer,
Delhi, and Khatu reused elements appeared alongside those carved
ex novo, with the style of the spolia determining that of the newly
carved members (Meister 1972: 57), a phenomenon that "seems to
indicate more of a positive response than the traditional scholarly
interpretation of a violent extinguishing of a despised tradition
(Patel 2000: 322)."
In fact, the positive aesthetic value placed on architectural
materials reused in Indo-Ghurid mosques in India needs to be
seen in a wider cultural and geographic context. Similar Indic
traditions were, for example, espoused in contemporary funerary
monuments built for Ghurid patrons in the Indus Valley, which
make no use of stone or spolia, but are instead constructed from

brick, the established building material in the region. The style of
these monuments is closely related to that of the temples of the
region, and they appear to represent collaboration between local
artisans and those from Ghurid centers in Afghanistan (Flood 2001:
144-8, 157).
Even more remarkable is the evidence for Ghurid architectural
tastes and aesthetic values from Afghanistan itself. While Indic
elements such as purnagatha capitals may be found in the art of
the region from the eleventh century (Flood 2002a: 111, pls. 10.5-
6), along with decorative and structural techniques that hint at the
presence of Indian craftsmen (Fischer 1966: 29; Pinder-Wilson
2001: 157), it is precisely at the height of the Indian conquest at
the end of the twelfth century that a vogue for Indic ornament
manifests itself most strongly in the Ghurid homeland. The most
remarkable testimony to this vogue is the Masjid-i sangi at Larvand
in central Afghanistan, a small monument constructed in stone
(itself an anomaly in a region where brick was the norm) in an
idiom that is closely related to that of contemporary temples in
Gujarat and Kathiawar. Whether the Masjid-i sangi was the work
of migrant Indian craftsmen or was built with materials taken
to Afghanistan from India is not clear (Scarcia & Taddei 1973;
Ball 1990), but the proliferation of traditional Indic modes of
ornament is also evidenced in a number of other fragmentary late
twelfth-century Ghurid monuments (some dated) that make use of
standard decorative elements of Indic architecture, among them
vase-and-foliage capitals, lotus scrolls, and half-lotus friezes (Flood
2001: 153-54, figs. 42-43). Taken with the evidence of the Indian
monuments themselves, the reception of such ornament in the
Ghurid heartlands strongly suggests that the material reused in Indo-
Ghurid mosques was invested with a positive aesthetic value.
The third and final of Cunningham's assumptions concerns
not the specifics of the Indian mosque, but the more general
assumption that a virulent iconophobia determined an aggressively
negative attitude towards all figural imagery on the part of medieval

Muslims. This idea, first promulgated in colonial era reports on
the early Indian mosques, is of course premised on the essentialist
discourse discussed at the outset. It continues to have currency,
albeit in qualified forms: in a revised edition of the most influential
survey book on Islamic art and architecture, the iconoclastic
transformations witnessed in the Delhi mosque are ascribed to the
"fanatic iconoclasts who formed the backbone of the conquering
armies" (Ettinghausen, et al. 2001: 163-4). The notion of Ghurid
armies as comprised of violent iconoclasts similarly seems to
underlie continued assertions that the images on the reused stones
were originally covered (Welch 1993: 311), despite the evidence
to the contrary within and without the mosque. Seldom is it noted,
for example, that, in their Indian coin issues, the Ghurid sultans
continued pre-existing types featuring Hindu deities such as
Lakshmi and Nandi (Sastri 1937: 495; Flood forthcoming). While it
by no means proves that the issue of the image was unproblematic,
the minting of such coins certainly reveals a more complex and
ambivalent response to figural imagery (even religious imagery)
on the part of the Ghurid sultans than one would suspect from
reading contemporary chronicles. The glimpse into this liminal
space between textual rhetoric and cultural practice provided by
the numismatic evidence may be broadened by reference to the
specific treatment of the images that appeared contemporaneously
on the richly carved stone elements reused in Indo-Ghurid mosques.
On closer inspection, many of the mosques that are assumed to
embody a visceral loathing of the image in fact offer evidence that
undermines the idea of a monolithic Islamic iconoclasm.
By the late twelfth century there was, as previously noted,
a long-established aversion to the use of figural imagery in the
decoration of a mosque, and the figural representations that appeared
on reused material in Indo-Ghurid mosques were indeed considered
problematic. Steps were therefore taken to alter some of the existing
figural decoration. The alteration of figural sculpture on elements
valued for their aesthetic properties is by no means exclusive to

India: the same phenomenon is manifest contemporaneously in the
Crusader sculptures reused in the Islamic monuments of Jerusalem
after the city had been recaptured in the twelfth century (Jacoby
1992: 21). Moreover, the treatment of images on the material reused
in the Indo-Ghurid mosques is closely correlated to the nature of
the imaged; the economics of iconoclasm evidently dictated that
only those images considered problematic were altered.
The alteration of anthropomorphic imagery is the closest one
gets to a monolithic iconoclasm in the Indo-Ghurid mosque, and
considerable resources appear to have been expended in neutralizing
such imagery. In only a few cases are the alterations so drastic
that they amount to the total elimination of the form so that it is
no longer recognizable or visible only in shadow outline. In most
cases the alteration is restricted to the mutilation of the face or
head (figures 1-2). Much less energy was expended on dealing
with animal imagery, which is only occasionally altered (as noted
by Shokoohy & Shokoohy 1993: 109 and 1996: 335). Certain types
of representational imagery, including figural imagery, were thus
left untouched in Indo-Ghurid mosques, with elephants, birds,
and mythological creatures such as maqaras appearing alongside
headless torsos and noseless faces. This is particularly evident in
the northern porch of the Kaman mosque, richly embellished with
reused figural sculpture which has been selectively mutilated, so
that elephant heads and the images of mythological creatures are
intact, while anthropomorphic images are defaced.
Most remarkable of all, and perhaps by virtue of its perceived
apotropaïc properties, the image of the radiant horned lion, the
kīrtimukha was not only left unaltered, but became as ubiquitous
a figure as it had been in pre-Ghurid Buddhist stupas and Hindu
temples (Flood, forthcoming). Based on a brief and unscientific
headcount, in the Qutbi Mosque, the Ghurid Friday Mosque of Delhi
alone the image of the kirtimukha appears more than thirty times
on the trabeate lintels that still remain in place (roughly fifty per
cent of the original number), and innumerable more times on the

reused columns that support them. This survival is not the random
product of chance but represents a deliberate choice, for throughout
the mosque one can find pillars on which anthropomorphic figures
have been defaced while the associated image of the kirtimukha
remains intact (figure 3). Even in the mosques at Ajmer and Khatu,
where the iconoclastic alterations are most extensive, numerous
manifestations of the beast are still intact. In fact, it seems to
have been considered such an integral part of the contemporary
mosque, that it is found on elements that were apparently carved
ex novo for Ghurid mosques in India (at Khatu, for example),
and on the entrance and interior beams of the Masjid-i sangi in
central Afghanistan, where it features alongside friezes of ducks
or geese (hamsamithunas) similar to those found in contemporary
Hindu temples (Scarcia and Taddei 1973: 98, figs. 3-4). The latter
serves as a cogent reminder that even figuration was no bar to the
assimilation of Indic elements in monuments erected for Ghurid
patrons, within or without India.
As the case of the kirtimukha demonstrates, it was not figuration
per se that was the problem, nor even figuration in the context of
mosque decoration, but the nature of what was represented in such
a context. Paradoxically, despite a supposed quasi-pathological
aversion to figural imagery, a surprisingly liberal attitude to
figuration seems to have prevailed in the first mosques built after
the Ghurid conquest.
5. Refiguring Indo-Islamic Iconoclasm
   Part of the problem with the way Indo-Ghurid mosques have
   been conceptualized from the nineteenth-century onwards lies
   in a disciplinary tendency to privilege the creation of a work
   (be it painting, sculpture or monument) over its reception. The
   consequences of what might be called a synchronic fixation are
   abundantly clear in Cunningham's characterization of the reuse of
   temple materials in Ghurid mosques as a barbarous anti-aesthetic
   gesture. If, however, we approach the work diachronically, not as

a static creation frozen at the moment of birth, but as dynamic and
constantly shifting in terms of form, content and meaning, then we
can begin to conceive of reuse and the role of iconoclasm in the
early Indian mosque in a less reductive manner.
Far from being the driving force behind the desecration of
existing monuments, such alteration of figural imagery as occurred
was contingent upon a preference for the reuse of stone elements.
Some of this material may have come from temples destroyed
during the conquest, but the majority of it was re-deployed in a
manner congruent with pre-conquest practice and seems to reflect
a contemporary vogue for Indic ornament that is manifest even in
the architecture of Afghanistan at this period. The various responses
to figural imagery witnessed in the Indo-Ghurid mosque might
be seen as a contingent compromise rooted in a tension between
continuity and discontinuity. Indeed, as an architectural creation
with multiple aesthetic affinities, the Indo-Ghurid mosque itself is
the product of such a compromise.
In his work on iconoclasm during the French Revolution, Richard
Wrigley has noted that, "in practice, we find that acts of iconoclasm
are commonly exercises in compromise, usually resulting in
hybridized or synthetic results" that represent a dialectical synthesis
between different traditions (Wrigley 1993: 185). As Wrigley notes,
the product of such compromise may be intended to convey a quite
different message than the original work, but its original meanings
are never entirely obliterated; they are always present under erasure,
obscured yet still visible and in dialogue with the superimposed
marks of effacement. Such altered images index their own history
of transformation, which is integral to the production of what is
in effect a new work. The act of iconoclasm may thus be seen as
an attempt to re-code meaning according to new iconographic
and aesthetic conventions. Rather than see the process in terms of
hybridization or syncretism with its implied "condition of uneasy
union" (Stewart & Ernst, forthcoming), the physical and conceptual
displacements that it entails might be best conceptualized as a type

of visual translation. The concept of translation that it implies is
not the traditional one of equivalence or fidelity to an original,
however, but one closer to Derrida's notion of textual translation
as "a regulated transformation of one language by another, of one
text by another" (Derrida\[-Bass\] 1981: 20). Homi Bhabha has
developed this idea in arguing that the process of translation gives
rise not to secondary (and implicitly inferior) versions of original
texts, but to new works that contain traces of earlier meanings that
they transcend (Bhabha 1990; Evans 1994: 32). Although developed
in relation to texts, this concept of translation as a transformative
process that gives rise to new works has much to recommend it as
a model for understanding iconoclastic transformations of existing
artworks.
In a recent posthumous publication, the anthropologist Alfred
Gell argued that as the product of a type of 'artistic agency', the
act of iconoclasm often follows the same conceptual structure
as the act of creation, giving rise to a new work, related to, but
distinct from the original (Gell 1998: 62-65). The concept of the
iconoclastic gesture as an extension of the creative process, a mode
of creating new works out of old, has a long pedigree in western
art, notably in Duchamp's LHOOQ (Gamboni 1997: 262), and
Rauschenberg's Erased de Kooning (Gamboni 1997: 268). The
idea of 'creative iconoclasm' has been particularly in evidence in
the past decade, from which one could cite many examples. In May
1994, for example, an artist named Mark Bridger erased Damien
Hirst's Away from the Flock, a work consisting of a whole sheep
suspended in a glass tank of formaldehyde, by pouring black dye
6 In an important and innovative article Tony Stewart (2000) has explored
the implications of different translation theories for conceptualizing inter-
communal textual production in early modern Bengal. While acknowledging
the value of translation theory for conceptualizing various modes of cultural
production across cultural, linguistic, or religious boundaries in pre-colonial
South Asia, my own theoretical perspective is more indebted to recent work
located at the intersection between post-structuralist and postcolonial theories
of translation (e.g. Niranjana 1992) than to formal linguistic theories.

into the solution in which the animal was suspended. Claiming
authorship of the amended work, Bridger placed a label, which read
"Mark Bridger, Black Sheep, May 1, 1994," over the original title.
Sued for criminal damage, Bridger claimed that his intention was
not to destroy the work but to transform it creatively (Kastner 1997:
154). The authors of the works targeted in these creative outbursts
have sometimes accepted, either implicitly or explicitly, that such
radical alterations to the original works constituted an extension
of the creative process. Damien Hirst, for example, published an
image of his Away from the Flock with a sliding tab that enables
the reader to reproduce the inked-out version of the original work
(Hirst 1997).
I do not want to suggest here that those responsible for having
the figural imagery on the architectural elements reused in Indian
mosques altered would have justified their actions in post-
structuralist terms, if at all. Nor would I argue for a moment that
they had as self-conscious or self-publicizing an approach to the act
of alteration as the modern iconoclasts just mentioned. Moreover,
unlike the iconoclastic gestures of French Revolutionaries or
contemporary artists, the acts of iconoclasm to which Indo-
Ghurid mosques bear witness were not the driving force in the
production of a work that might be entitled 'The Indo-Ghurid
Mosque'. They were instead contingent upon a decision to reuse
pre-existing architectural materials, which may have constituted
an attack on the religio-political symbols of the ancien regime,
but also reflects, as we have seen, the positive aesthetic value that
Afghan patrons placed on Indic art and architecture. Nevertheless,
despite this difference, conceiving of iconoclastic transformation
as part of a broader process of visual translation enables us to
escape the bind into which we are placed when we privilege the
originary work (whether Persian mosque or Indian temple) as more
authentic than any subsequent work created from its elements.
Transcending this synchronic fixation, we can see the physical and
conceptual translations witnessed in the Indo-Ghurid mosque not as

barbarous attacks upon (or crude approximations of) an originary
aesthetic tradition ('Indian' or 'Persian)', but part of a process of
transmutation that gave rise to the Indo-Ghurid mosque, a new
work with its own distinctive aesthetic.
This analysis may seem anachronistic, but it finds some support
among the Hadith discussed at the outset, which prescribe a
transformative practice comparable to those just described. Among
a group of Traditions that deal with the angel Gabriel's refusal to
enter the house of the Prophet Muhammad is one which attributes
his hesitancy to the presence of images on a curtain and another
unspecified object. The remedy for the curtain is to transform it
into pillows that will be thrown on the ground and trodden upon,
while the Prophet is ordered to decapitate the remaining images,
so that they become like trees by virtue of their inanimate status
(Ibn Hanbal 1313/1895 2: 305, 308, 390; van Reenen 1990: 33).
Formal or iconographic transformation is a relatively common
response to iconoclastic concerns (witnessed, for example, in the
transmutation of the Virgin into Liberty in Revolutionary France),
but the nature of the transformation envisaged in the Hadith entails
a radical conceptual metamorphosis. The resemblance between tree
and headless image clearly lies in the fact that both are perceived
to lack a spirit (rūḥ) and with it, the potential for animation (van
Reenen 1990: 33,54). Decapitation is evidently judged to result in
the production of what are in fact images of an entirely different
class than the original, inanimate and licit in place of the animate
and illicit originals. The acts of desecration and creation thus appear
closely intertwined, the simultaneity of their products destabilizing
the boundaries between abstraction and figuration that is integral
to much art historical thinking. This blurring of the boundaries is
particularly marked in the iconoclastic reworking of figural material
in the Ghurid mosque at Ajmer. Although the phenomenon has not
been noted previously, at several points the columns in the upper
levels of the southern end of the prayer-hall have had their figures
removed in such a way as to leave only a rhomboid outline (figure

4), which perfectly replicates the form of the rhomboidal ratna
designs of similar size that have been carved ex novo on the lower
shafts of the same columns (figure 5). The latter replace the figural
imagery normally found in this position in temple architecture
(Patel 2000: 233)."
Both newly carved members and those that have undergone
iconoclastic transformations are thus structurally and decoratively
integrated in the Ajmer mosque. As Alka Patel has noted of Indo-
Ghurid mosques, "if the buildings were ... viewed in their entireties,
it would have been visually difficult to extract the despoliated from
the newer materials" (Patel 2000: 236). The view of these mosques
as disjointed reflections of the greater wholes upon whose life and
death their creation is predicated probably offers more of an insight
into the methodologies of modern art historians than the tastes of
Ghurid patrons. At least in the case of the Delhi mosque, we have
an unusual abundance of descriptions from the century and a half
following its construction (Flood forthcoming). The fact that none
of these thirteenth- and fourteenth-century descriptions mention
either the reuse of temple elements or the associated iconoclastic
alterations strongly supports the idea that the mosque was viewed
as a unitary whole by those who used it.
While contingent upon a decision to reuse existing architectural
elements, the alteration of figural imagery was integral to the
creation of that unitary whole. A widespread and long established
aversion to the use of figural imagery in the decoration of a mosque
led to steps being taken to neutralize anthropomorphic images on the
reused architectural elements in ways that conformed to orthodox
prescriptions and established practice. The process provides
evidence for the creative function of iconoclastic transformation at
both the micro and the macro level: in the transformation of illicit
7 Perhaps fortuitously, the substitution of a rhomboid for anthropomorphic
imagery is also found on certain late eight-century coins from Tabaristan in
Iran that otherwise follow pre-Islamic numismatic models: Miles (1975): 366,
pl. 25(7).

anthropomorphic figures into qualitatively new images, and in the
contribution that this made to the creation of what was in effect a
Ghurid Gesamtkunstwerk. The close relationship (in both theory
and practice) between acts of image alteration and architectural
creation in the early Indian mosque serves as an indication that,
even when rationalized within the rhetorical frame of religious
orthodoxy, iconoclasm in the medieval Islamic world was less the
product of an essential cultural pathology than a series of choices
made by multiple historical agents and governed by a complex
nexus of aesthetic, cultural, economic, and political factors.

APPENDIX
A Translation of Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee's Address to the Public Meeting at Somnath*
New Delhi, Kartik, 1923
31, October, 2001
The following is the text \[in Hindi\] of the speech made by the Prime Minister, Shri
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, today, at Somnath (Gujarat) on the occasion of the golden
jubilee of the 'Sanctification of the jyotirlinga at Somnath'.
-
Today is a day of great joy. Today it is exactly fifty years since
the idol of Lord Somnath was sanctified here at the temple. There
is another reason for joy - today is also the jayanti of Sardar
Vallabhbhai Patel. This is his 125th anniversary. This is a precious
coincidence - like the invaluable union of gold and diamond
for had Sardar not been there Somnath would not exist today
in this form. In what state it would have existed I cannot say. But
Somnath is the symbol of our sanatan sanskriti (timeless culture),
our shaswat dharma (eternal religion, way of life), the symbol of
the successive shifts and changes in our history. History had also
witnessed that moment when conquering invaders razed Somnath to
the ground. Today too such tendencies are becoming stronger. But
the manner in which we resurrected Somnath, rebuilt Somnath on
new foundations, and defeated the ones who razed it to the ground
and destroyed it - in the same manner those who want to advance on
* The text was officially made available to media by the Government agencies.

the strength of terrorism today, who do not worship idols but want
to destroy them, these people will meet the same fate as those who
had dared to break Somnath \[in the past\]. Somnath is the symbol
of our immortal culture, Somnath is the symbol of that continuing
struggle, Somnath is the symbol of our national self-respect.
Today Lord Somnath is being well cared for. Pilgrims come here
from all over the country. This is a matter of great joy. We want that
Somnath and the entire neighbourhood around it should gain a new
life, a new form. There are a number of pilgrimage centres close to
Somnath, which are linked with it but are spread out in the region.
Here we have Porbunder, here we have many holy places for the
immersion of ashes, and here we have the picturesque Giri, a place
worth visiting. There is Palitana, there is Junagadh, and I can see
before me Somnath in the past repeatedly razed to the ground and
still standing tall, talking with the sky. Standing proud exactly at
the same spot where so many unsuccessful attempts were made to
destroy its pride. In this region we now have a new Chief Minister,
and I am convinced that he will make efforts towards enhancing this
sacred space \[around Somnath\]. Whatever resources are required for
this would be somewhat taken care of by the Indian Government.
Listen to this carefully - you may understand 'somewhat' to mean
just a little or you may understand it to mean all that is required. It
all depends on your perception. But this region is a sacred space.
Dwarika is here, and I have already mentioned Palitana. Gujarati
tourists travel in very large numbers to other parts of the state;
they travel to all parts of the country. In the same measure tourists
residing in other parts of the country should visit Gujarat. It is very
necessary to ensure that. I have been told that there is one difficulty
there is no broad gauge \[railway track\]. This drawback was
noticed even when Advaniji decided to begin his yatra from here
on a rath rather than by train! Of course he had anyway made up
his mind to travel on his rath, but a broad gauge for railways must
be established here of that I am convinced, and a broad gauge
will most definitely be built here, I assure you of that.
-

Gujarat has immense possibilities for growth and development,
although it is true that Gujarat has had to face a lot of adversity due
to nature - such a massive earthquake. But I want to congratulate
the people of Gujarat, of Kutch, to thank them for the courage
with which they have faced the natural calamities. A new Kutch, a
new Gujarat is being built out of the fallen ruins. I remember the
day when people came (from distant places) offering help, and the
self-respecting people who were no doubt in need, but had their
pride intact, would say that they did not need help. We can stand
up on our own; we do not require anybody's help. In those days we
even saw another side of the rest of the world; it seemed the whole
world partook in alleviating problems, wherever a crisis loomed.
Differences were forgotten. Petty conflicts were overlooked. Before
the earthquake there were the floods, the drought; Gujarat has been
in continuous struggle with nature. But mankind has never accepted
defeat in the face of the challenges from nature. For this I want to
congratulate the people of Gujarat. You may go anywhere in the
world, to any part of the world, you will find migrants from Gujarat.
They will meet you with great affection, and if you are a little
confused about the food offered, the minute you taste the sweet daal
(lentils) you will immediately recognize that it is Gujarati food you
are being offered. Such sweetness, one sometimes thinks had there
been a bit of sourness as well it would be to advantage. Perhaps
Narendra bhai \[Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister of Gujarat\]
can inject that. Hard work needs this edge, the confidence to move
forward, the resolve to meet all challenges. Such resolve that was
the hallmark of Sardar Patel's life; had Sardar not been there, there
would have been no Bharat. The British wanted to divide Bharat
into 500 pieces (separate regions) before they actually left. The
_rajas_ and nawabs of that time were dreaming of ruling over each
of these separate kingdoms. People were saying Bharat would get
divided. Sardar said "No"; the division we have agreed to is correct,
but there will be no more divisions. Whether Kashmir should
remain here or whether it should be there - whenever there are such

discussions people forget (Sardar Patel), and Advaniji has referred
to this recently - the people of Jammu and Kashmir had voluntarily
opted to be a part of Bharat, that decision cannot be reversed, that
pledge is unbreakable, that decision is unchangeable. We will not
allow the country to be divided again. That it happened once was
unfortunate, there was foreign rule, the design to create divisions;
but Sardar was there, and under his leadership the foundation of
national unity was created. He brought together all the small and
big kingdoms and gave Bharat its form of a grand nation.
Today Bharat is strong, today Bharat is organized, today Bharat
is moving forward towards prosperity. Today Bharat is ready to
face any challenge. Nobody should be under an illusion. Some
people fall prey to illusions when they see our sisters adorned
with bangles, and they cite those bangles. We don't speak such a
language. But we do say that in Punjab, where wearing bangles is
a custom, where the practice is widespread and with reference to
which this has been said - along with bangles a karha (wrist-band)
is also worn, a karha made of iron. Bangles along with the karha
- but it is not an indication of manliness to keep harping on bangles.
  Maintaining our self-control and keeping our armed forces on alert,
  having confidence in our scientists and congratulating our soldiers
- all that Sardar Patel has bequeathed to us as heritage - we will
  defend it and move forward. I have confidence that this region will
  develop and move forward. If there are any new schemes in the
  offing we will sit with the Chief Minister and discuss them.
  I am very grateful for the opportunity to be here today and
  express my veneration to Lord Somnath. Namaskar!
+ The Prime Minister was referring to a common slight to male masculinity where
  it was suggested that a man adorned himself, like a woman, with bangles. He
  reminded his audience that in the Punjab men wear the karha, an iron wrist
  band, and nobody (at least not since the British invented the idea of 'martial
  races') would dare cast aspersions on Punjabi masculinity.
