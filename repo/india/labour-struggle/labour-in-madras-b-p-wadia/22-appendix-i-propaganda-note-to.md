# APPENDIX I

A propaganda note issued to the Labour Party Conference
at Southport in June 1919, by Mr. B. P.
Wadia, under the heading "Labour in India."

Textile factories employ workers for twelve hours
& day.

Children between the age of 9 and 14 are employed
for work for six hours a day.

Housing arrangements are non-existent and even
discussions on the problem are meagre and academical.

Many workers live in villages several miles away
from the factories employing them, and, therefore, they
have to leave home at 4 A. M. and walk to the Mills so as
to be at the gate by 5--45 A. M. They leave the Mills at
6 P. M. and reach home merely in time to eat their food
apd go to bed.

Thus, labourers have neither leisure for recreation
nor time for sufficient rest.

The twelve hours working day has one break of 30
minutes. Observations have shown that on account of
faulty exit and entrance arrangements a labourer does
not get more than 12 to 13 minutes for his food --- the rest
of the time is spent in getting out and in again into
the factories.

Young persons are employed on the shift system
--- each shift of six hours. The first one from 6 A. M. to 12
noon, and the second from 19 noon to 6 P. u. Like
their elders they walk to the factories from adjoining
villages and so their working day is of eight hours,
which leaves them no time for education.

The sanitary conditions in many factories are
primitive and objectionable.

Medical aid even in case of accidents is often not
available.

Wages are scandalously low. In Madras an examination
has shown that the average pay is 20 to 22/6
per month for a textile factory worker.

Even then the wages due at the end of each month
are not paid till the 15th of the following month, and
sometimes later.

After years of silent suffering the Indian labourers
have begun to organize their forces.

In the City of Madras we have formed separate,
Unions for the Textile Factory Workers, the Tramwaymen,
the Rickshaw Drivers, the Printers and Railway
Workshopmen. This work was begun in April 1918,
and already we have about 17,000 members in Madras
alone, Labourers in other towns have appealed for
help in organizing them similarly.

We appeal for your moral and material support.
When you ask for higher wages and better conditions
you are met by the cry that the Indian Mill competes
against you. When the Indian worker asks for better
things he is told that you compete against him. Both
you and he suffer because we are divided. The cause of
labour is one.

Give us your help!
