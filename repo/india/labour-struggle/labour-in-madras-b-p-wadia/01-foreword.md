# FOREWORD

There is no one in India who knows so well
as does Mr. B. P. Wadia the needs of Indian
labour, the legislation that has been passed into
law, the legislation that is now required to help
and establish labour's rights. He was the first to
organise and establish a durable Trades Union. He
is the first victim of the present state of Indian
law which allows trades union leaders to be sued
for loss caused to employers by Trades Unions action,
legitimate in other lands. He therefore is
well-fitted to write this book.

As my friend of many years standing and
as an old Trades Union colleague at Labour party
Conferences, I am delighted to write this Foreword,
and to be witness to the selfless work done
for years by a man unjustly maligned both by
rivals and by enemies.

There are many who are now helping Indian
Labour to its place in the sun, great orators such
as Lajpat Rai, great thinkers such as Mahatma
Gandhi, but pone has so resolutely given all
bis strength to the one cause --- the organisation
and emancipation of Labour.

If everything should be subordinated to Trades.
Union work, I think Wadia is right in keeping clea
of political parties. In England, we have Conservative
Trades Unionists; here in India is a large body
of "Untouchable" Trades Unionists, who resent
bitterly their social subordination under caste rule.
All Trades Unionists must be kept together if they
are to defeat capital; Nationalists who resent
English domination and untouchables who resent
Brahmin domination, must be kept together. For
such reasons, Labour was of no party in England
before it became its own party. For exactly the
same reasons, Labour here too must eschew party
politics till it can speak for itself.

I do not believe that Labour has been or is
being "used" by politicians as some suppose. The
thinking men who lead must have politics of their
own, but it would be wise to keep nationalism
and anti-Brahminism in the background, when
they are doing their work for labour. Do not
introduce politics into the Union.

It is inevitable that in the beginning Trades
Unions must be organised and conducted by
educated men from outside the Trade. The train.
ing of a General Secretary from a working hand
is a long business. Just as in England the trained
Unionists of the National Union of Railwaymen
started, organised and trained the Agricultural
Labours Unions, so in India the lawyers must be
expected to organise the workers. It is a libel to
pretend that they profit from the work, and I wish
more would act as unselfishly. But Wadia is not
even a lawyer. About such a man there is no
thought or hope or prospect of gain. He is typical
of India's spirit of self-sacrifice.

As soon as possible, and in the interests of the
Unions, men who have worked at the Trade
should be trained to lead the Unions. They know
the trade and difficulties of jargon as no lawyer
can. But when the employers ask for only such
Unions as are led by workers, they are now really
asking for tame incompetent Unions, and they
drag in the terms "lawyer and politics" to create
prejudice. Soon men of the trade will be leaders;
but then they must be whole-time officials paid by
the Union, and not the masters' servants liable to
victimisation and, worse still, to corruption by
promotion.

But the Trades Unions must use politics, even
while they avoid party politics. The Unions are
so weak and helpless at present --- so prescribed by
law --- that they have to turn to Government.
While they are voteless they can only turn as suppliants.
They can only show that the politicians
who help them, they will help by their voices now,
by their votes in the future.

At once a law is wanted legalising Trades
Unions as in England. Then Factory Acts are
wanted :--- Employers' Liability Acts; Minimum
Wage Laws. Even now by using their friends on
the Councils they can, by Question and Resolution,
press forward these laws. Leaders who say
that Non-Co-operation bars out the use of any
present Councillor, do not understand the urgency
of Labour's need, or its ability to force its claim,
even without the vote. lo this book Wadia has
indicated the nature of the trouble and the way
oat. I beg Labour Leaders generally not to sus
pend the use of a weapon which may help to put
matters right for India's starving poor.
