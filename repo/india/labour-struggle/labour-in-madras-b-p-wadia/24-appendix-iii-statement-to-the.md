# APPENDIX III

A Statement submitted by Mr. B. P. Wadia to the
Joint Committee of the two Houses of Parliament on
Indian Reforms presided over by Lord Selborne on behalf
of Indian Labour, on August 12th 1919.

Labour in India may be divided into three classes:
(1) Agricultural, including that on plantations; (2)
Mining; (3) Factory. I am fairly familiar with the bad
conditions from which labour in India in all these indus
tries suffers, but my intimate experience is related to
Factory Labour ia Madras. I am the President of the
Madras Labour Union, formed in Madras on the 27th
April 1918. This Union has already had an interesting
career; it has had to struggle aot only to grow, but even
to exist, and has survived two lock-outs on the part of
certain employers. Since then several other Unions
have been established in the city of Madras. The Madras
Tramway men's Union has emerged successfully out of
two strikes; the Rickshawallah's Union came into
existence in the midst of a strike; the remaining
two, the Printers and the Railway workshops Unions
were the last to be formed. At Negapatam a strong Union
of Railwaymen has been formed and is rooted in firma
ground. I have had the honour and privilege to initiate
and organise this work in India and from Bombay, Calcutta,
Cawapore, and Lucknow I have received invitations
from working men to visit their cities and organise unions,
The pressure of public work in hand has made it impossible
for me to visit them, but I am planning to organise
them on my return to India.

On account of various causes labour troubles have
been prevalent in India for many months; the strained
economic conditions and the great rise in prices have
been the main causes of this unrest. The forces let loose
by the War and the Russian Revolution have to a certain
extent widened and coloured the political outlook of
the Indian labourer. For many weary years bis
patience has been heavily taxed, and he has been on
the look-out for means to improve his lot. Excessive
hours, low wages, premature exhaustion due to malnutrition,
lack of education for himself and his children,
absence of any housing arrangements, and of general
sanitary conditions, and the prevalence of apathy on the
part of the authorities and the employers have made the
Indian labourer restless. The Indian Factories Act was
passed in 1881 ; during nearly 40 years twice only has
that Act been amended. In September 1890, an Indian
Factory Commission was appointed, and again in 1908
the Indian Labour Commission went round. The reports
of these Commissions led to the amending of the Factory
Act, and the last occasion on which this was done was
in 1911. The law now obtains as it was amended in 1911.
This law enables an employer to engage
labourers for 12 hours per day on six days in
the week --- i.e., 72 hours per week. Women are allowed
be employed for 11 hours per day. Young persons --- i.e.,
boys and girls of 9 to 14 years of age --- are employed for
six hours per day ; generally. two shifts are used in
textile factories. The long day of 12 hours has the
ridiculously small break of 30 minutes in the middle of
it. This 12-hour day lengthens into 13 or 14, or even
more, as was recently pointed out by an able Indian
Civil Servant: "From the standpoint of the worker, the
time taken in going to and returning from the factory
must be added to the length of his active day, which
cannot then be less than 13 hours."

In the matter of wages the law is dumb. In th
matter of sanitation and factory inspection it speaks in
halting tones, and those who have practical experience
know how superficial is the actual inspection, and how
ineffective really in bettering the lot of the labourer.

Thus, it will be perceived that the record of the
administration in improving and bettering the condition of
the factory labourer is not a satisfactory one. This point
is cot only of academic interest, but becomes a matter
of urgent practical importance when we see that the
Report of the Functions Committee makes the settlement
of labour disputes" and the "welfare of labour,
including provident funds, industrial insurance (general,
health and accident) and housing" reserved subjects. I
do not quite understand why the somewhat peculiar
arrangement detailed below is resorted to in that Report.
If we refer to p. 26 of the Functions Committee Report
and look at items 24 and 95, and then turn to p. 46 and
look at serial No. 15, we find that No. 24, "development
of Industries, including industrial research and technical
education," is a transferred subject, in all provinces,
while No. 25, "Industrial matters included under the
following heads:

(a) Factories.,
(b) Settlement of labour disputes,
(c) Electricity,
(d) Boilers,
(e) Gas,
(f) Smoke nuisance, and
(g) Welfare of labour, including provident funds, industrial
insurance (general, health sod accident) and housing"

are reserved in all provinces.

This is the first point which I respectfully submit
for consideration to the Joint Committee. I would
strongly urge that the whole of No. 25 of the Provincial
subjects (Functions Report, p. 26) should
be transferred. Of the seven items included in No.
25, (a) (6) (.) (d) are made "subject to Indian
legislation": while I see the point of (a) factories, (c)
electricity, and (d) boilers being made subject to Indian
Legislation for the sake of obtaining uniformity, I fail
to see why (6) settlement of labour disputes should be so
treated. This is actually to sow the seed of future
discord, and I think it my duty to strike a note of
warning. Trade Unionism is bound to grow fast in
India; the settlement of labour disputes will be claimed
as one of their rights by the Trade Unions on behalf of
the labourer, and if it is in the hand of Government, it
will bring the Unions into conflict with Government and
will inevitably lead the labourers to regard the Government
as on the side of the employers. The Government
should limit its work to the creation of permanent
Boards of Arbitration to which labour disputes can be
referred, on lines similar to a Labour Board suggested by
some of us last October for Madras.

Presently we shall require in India some kind of
legislation for the recognition of Trade Unions and other
labour organisations. Why should a start not be made
now, by transferring the whole of item No. 25 and
making the popular half of the provincial diarchical
government responsible for the entire subject of the
development of industries --- which is recommended to be
a transferred subject (with the exception of large industries
claimed by the Government of India) --- and the
management of industrial matters, including the most.
important item (g) welfare of labour? It is my considered
opinion that Indian ministers will be better fitted to
carry out adequate factory reforms than the official
executive. Anyway, the past record of the administration
does not inspire hope or confidence in their capacity
or zeal for bettering the lot of the misused labourer.
Therefore, with all the force I can command I respectfully
urge that item No. 25 of the provincial subjects.
should aot be reserved but should be transferred.

This naturally brings us to the question of Indian
Labour properly and adequately influencing the legislatures.
So far back as 1911 Mr. E S. Montagu, speaking
on the Indian Budget in the House of Commons, said :---

>The leaders of Indian opinion must set their faces against the
degradation of labour, and they need to be specially vigilant
boca use India's working classes, besides being themselves.
unorganised, are not directly represented on the Legislative
councils, whose Indian members come almost exclusively from
the landlord and capitalistic classes.

I have only quoted one sentence, but I beg to draw
the attention of the Committee to the whole passage in
Mr. Montagu's speech.

It is true that in the past non-official members of
Legislative Councils have been mostly landlords or
capitalists or lawyers who did not familiarise themselves
with the difficulties and complexities of the life and work
c? the Indian labourer. I am not forgetting such men
as Gopal Krishna Gokhale of the Imperial Council or
Dewan Bahadur P. Kesava Pillai of the Provincial, who
have on more than one occasion championed the cause
of the poor. But how are we going to remedy the evils
of the past?

In the Bill before us, I find so attempt made to introduce
any measure of reform which will give the labourer
any voice in safeguarding his own interests; in no way
can be better his own conditions ; he will have to rely on, as
in the past, on the goodwill of others, be they foreigners
or be they his own countrymen; he has been exploited
in the past and will continue to be so exploited. But
what is worse, the people who exploit him are coming into
greater power. Take Madras --- the Franchise Committee
recommend a Provincial Council of 120, of which 13 are
unalloyed capitalistic seats. A factory manager, a shop
owner, a planter, can not only vote but get elected from
his Chamber of Commerce, bis Trades Association, bis
Planters Association. Capitalists will form a powerful
element in the Provincial Council ; and under the
system of franchise recommended by the Southborough
Committee, the labouring classes will not be able to influence
the election. I am speaking specially with
reference to the factory labourer, and Bombay affords a
better example, the Millowners' Association returns a
member, but no labourers' association exists. Commerce
and Industry have eight seats --- excluding landholders'
seats --- and not a single seat is made available for the
representative of labour. I will grant at once that
labour organisations do not exist to any great extent ;
but is that sufficient reason for allowing the exploitation
of Indian labour ? Is there no way to bring the
Indian labourer into power ? I maintain that the Indian
labourer's interests must be safeguarded, and that the
process of safeguarding them must be put into his own
hands and into no one else's. I beg to submit that the
masses in India --- and among them are the factory
labourers --- have a culture of their own. Their power of
understanding political and economical issues and
suggesting proper remedies in a practical manner is
well known to those who have worked for and with
them. Their political instincts are clear and strong.
The factor to be borne in mind is that the Indian
labourer loathes the idea of slavery in any shape or
form. The Indian labourers want to have schools for
their children, houses for themselves, better wages
and shorter hours --- all as a matter of right and
justice. The efforts on the part of the employers or
the Government to patronise the labourers are seen
as fetters of slavery, albeit golden fetters instead
of iron ones. This new spirit is in evidence among
Indian labourers, and it is well to recognise that even the
golden fetters are resented and the Indian labourer feels
that he is not only a "hand" but also that he has a head
and a heart, and aspires to come into his own.

Now, how is this to be done? What weapon can
the Joint Committee put into the hands of the labourer
to defend himself? The only adequate means that I can
suggest is the vote. Enable the Indian labourer to send
his own representatives to the Provincial Councils ; let
all matters relating to his welfare and betterment be in
the bands of responsible elected representatives who
have the confidence of the labourer. If my suggestion
made above that all Industrial matters, including the
welfare of labour, be transferred to the popular half of
the future provincial administration is given effect to.
we shall be on the right way to the solution, and we
immediately have to consider the enfranchisement of
Indian labour.

I have carefully studied the problem of Franchise
in the Madras Presidency. I have the honour to belong
to a small Society of careful researchers in the city of
Madras, who, after painstaking investigations, have
embodied the results of their study in a 60-page volume
of royal 8vo, size. I am referring to the Transaction
of the Neo-Fabian Society on _The Problem of Franchise
in the Madras Presidency_, and I beg to draw the attention
of the Committee to that publication.[^/1] In drawing
up our Neo-Fabian Scheme, we kept in mind the
Labourer, and it will serve my purpose to give the
qualifications for voters purposed by us.

(1) All those who pay the income tax, or the 'professional tax
(2) Graduates of all Indian and foreign Universities recognised
by their respective Governments.
(3) Any person paying land revenue directly.
(4) Occupants of houses and premises of the annual rental
value of Rs. 48 in municipal areas and Rs. 24 in non-municipal
areas.
(5) Tenants of Zamindari and Raiyatwari holdings paying
Rs. 10 rental.

As will be seen from pp. 40--41 the people thus
enfranchised will be about four millions in the Madras
Presidency. This may sound appalling in view of the
Franchise Committee's $42,000 total electors, but with
due deference to that body, I may point out that it tried
to please a few somewhat obstinate and retrogressive
Madras officials and did not view the problem from a
really broad point of view in the light of the actual
experience of other countries of the world in this respect.
Also, I think the difficulties of election arrangements are.
overrated.

[^/1] I hope I shall not be considered as transgressing my pro
vince as a witness before this Committee if I also venture to draw
their attention to another Transaction of the Society on _Problems
of Reform in the Government of India_ which throws light on the
thorny subjects of the Indian Legislative Assembly, the Council
of State and Electoral Methods.

However, observing the way in which the reforms
are shaping themselves, I regretfully abandon the 4
million voters for Madras, and in advocating enfranchisement
for Indian Factory Labour, I beg leave to put
before this Joint Committee two suggestions. My aim
is to gain for the factory labourer direct influence in the
legislature. My first suggestion gives him power, and a
really suitable environment for political education ; the
second suggestion does this in a less effective manner,
Both these suggestions are very bare outlines, and details
will have to be filled in after further consideration.

I have appended to this statement a table showing
the number of labourers employed in large industrial
establishments, both governmental and private. From
this it will be seen that some 950,000 Indians work in
such factories. The total number of workers in all indus
trial establishments is about 17,515,250. Both my suggestions
endeavour to bring on the electoral roll some at
least of the employees in large industrial establishments.

## I

I propose that all labourers working in factories
and earning a particular wage should be given the vote
The wage may differ in different provinces. For
Madras, I should suggest that every labourer earning
Rs. 15 per month in any large factory should be given
the vote. la Bombay and Calcutta tbe figure will have
to be higher. To members of this Committee who may
not be fully conversant with Indian labour conditions
this figure of Rs. 15 per month may appear very
low. May I draw their attention to the following
figures taken from the Indian Industrial Commission
Report:---

Specimen Wages of Calcutta Jute Mil Operatives
in June 1918, in Rupees per mensem :---

+----------+-----+
| Carders  | 9   |
+----------+-----+
| Rovers   | 12  |
+----------+-----+
| Spinners | 15¾ |
+----------+-----+
| Shifters | 11  |
+----------+-----+
| Winders  | 18  |
+----------+-----+
| Beamers  | 22  |
+----------+-----+
| Weavers  | 27  |
+----------+-----+
| Mastries | 30  |
+----------+-----+
| Coolies  | 13  |
+----------+-----+

Specimen Wages of Bombay Cotton Mill Operatives
in 1918 _including a War Bonus_ in Rupees per
mensem :---

+--------------------+----+----+
| Drawer (card room) | 23 | 6  |
+--------------------+----+----+
| Reeler             | 17 | 4  |
+--------------------+----+----+
| Warper             | 40 | 8  |
+--------------------+----+----+
| Rover              | 24 | 1  |
+--------------------+----+----+
| Dofler             | 12 | 10 |
+--------------------+----+----+
| Weaver             | 46 | 15 |
+--------------------+----+----+

In Madras the wages are much lower than in Bombay,
and I have, if the Committee wants it, a complete
Schedule of wages paid in the well-managed Buckingham
and Carnatic Mills.

The wages clearly show how necessary it is to give
the factory labourer the power of the vote, so that his
battles may be fought in the Legislative Chambers by his
elected representative. It is difficult to say how many factory
labourers could thus be enfranchised; but the authorities
can produce statements of how many ear Rs. 10, Rs.
15, Rs. 20, and so on in different provinces, and that
would be a guide to the Committee in considering the suggestion
that I am making.

## II

My alternative suggestion brings into play both election
and nomination methods. Every factory employing
more than 50 but less than 1,000 labourers should be the
unit ; all adult workers in such factories should be given
the vote to elect one representative. All labourers
working in factories employing more than 1,000 persons
should have the right to elect one more representative
for every thousand. Thus, a panel will be obtained of
several elected representatives; and one or two for each,
province can be nominated to the Provincial Councils
from this panel.

Instead of making every factory employing 50
persons the unit, the unit may be every Trade Union
with a membership of at least half the number of the
total employed in the factories in that city. Let me
illustrate: There are some 175 textile mills in Bombay
employing about 190,000 men. A Trade Union of
Textile Workers with a membership of 95,000 should be
given the right to elect a representative. Once again a
Panel is obtained and nominations may be made from
the Panel. The recognition of Trade Unions in this way
will accelerate the formation and progress of Trade
Unionism and will greatly assist India's political
growth.

## TRADE UNIONS AND CASTE SYSTEM

Working in Madras among the so-called lower castes
of Hindus and the poor people generally, I have had
special opportunities of gathering their views on the
non-Brahmana question. As far as the Labour Unions
are concerned, I may safely assert that Hindus of all
castes and members of other communities, Muslims,
Indian Christians, etc., can and do work harmoniously
together for their common welfare, without the least
difficulty. There are many members of the various
Unions who are Brahmanas and I have not heard any
complaints against them. In fact, the Brahmana-nonBrahmana
question has never arisen. A few
months ago I invited some 200 members of the Textile
Union to a dinner at Adyar, where I live. I invited Brahmanas,
non-Brahmanas of all castes, Muslims, Indian
Christians and Panchamas. At the dinner, next to me
sat a Panchama and by his side was a Brahmana; on
the other side of me sat a Brahmana, and next to him
was an Indian Christian. All were served the same
vegetarian food, they all were treated alike, and the
function was a great success. On numerous occasions
all castes and communities have joined hands in an
active manner. Further, I know for a fact that nonBrahmana
labourers regard as ridiculous the movement
started by some interested people, and they will not
allow caste questions to affect their labour work; and
that is also true of politics. I am a member of the
Madras Presidency Association, which is an organisation
of non-Brahmanas. I feel that these non-Brahmana
communities must be organised for national work and by
means of this Association we want to help the non-Brahmanas,
who include rich landlords and merchants and
artisans as also the bulk of the population, to take their
part in the political and general advancement of India.
Unlike the movement inaugurated by Dr. Nair, this Association
is not anti-Brahmana, but wants to co-operate
with Brahmanas to bring about the desired result. Anyway,
among the 20,000 poor people of Madras City with
whom I come in contact through one or other of the
Labour Unions, the anti-Brahmana movement finds no
favour and most of them are non-Brahmanas.

## CONCLUSION

In conclusion, I earnestly appeal to the Joint
Committee to enable the Indian Labourer to obtain
some political power, to set his feet on the road of
political advancement, and thereby of his own uplift.
The ghastly conditions under which he exists are not
easily describable; he has suffered in the past, and his
welfare should not in the future be made to depend on
those who are not responsible to him. The success of
these reforms to a great extent depends on the atmosphere
in which they will be worked in India. On account of
various reasons I anticipate trouble in the Labour camp.
If something is done now which will satisfy the labourer
and convince him that his representatives are looking
after his interests and fighting his battles, he will allow
his energy and impatience to flow into good constructive
work ; if nothing is done, then despair will seize him
and impatience will lead him to ugly expressions which
one wants to avoid in India.

## CROSS-EXAMINATION OF MR. B. P. WADIA

_Lord Selborne_: Would you like to add anything to
it, before the members of the Committee ask you questions
upon it?

_Mr. Wadia_: Well, my Lord, first one word,
namely of thanks op behalf of the labourers for calling
me here, which will give them a great hope and confidence
in your Lordship's Committee. I do not think I
need read the Memorandum, because it has been put in,
but with your permission I will make a very short statement,
which will take me a few minutes only. There
are in India some 17,515,000 workmen employed in
industries, of whom some 950,000 are in large establishments.
There is an Indian Factories Act, which was
originally passed in 1881, and was last amended in 1911.
The law permits a twelve hours day; women are worked
for eleven hours ; children between the ages of pine and
fourteen are worked for six hours. In the matter of
wages the law is dumb, in the matter of sanitation it
speaks in halting terms, and the inspection is superficial.
Thus, the record of the Administration in the past is not
a satisfactory one from the view point of the labourer.
Therefore, I respectfully suggest that in the list of Provincial
subjects both Nos. 24 and 25 and not only Na 24
should be transferred. I wish to draw the attention of
the member for your Committee to page 26 of the Functions
Committees Report. There we find No. 24 :
Development of Industries, including industrial Research
and Technical Education is a transferred subject, but
industrial matters included under the following heads :
Factories, Settlement of Labour Disputes, Electricity,
Boilers, Gas, Smoke Nuisances, and welfare of Labour
are all kept reserved in all the Provinces.

If both these items, 24 and 25, are transferred, then
the Committee must contrive to get Indian labour to
influence Provincial Legislatures in the future. As the
Bill is framed at present and as the Southborough Report
on Franchise stands, the Indian labourer is not at all
enabled to better his lot through proper representatives;
he will have to rely as in the past on the good will of
others, be they foreigners or be they his own country
man, · I submit that the labourer's interests must be
safeguarded and that the process of safeguarding them
must be put into his own hands and into no one else's.

This raises the question of the fitness of the Indian
labourer. I beg to submit that the masses in India
--- and among them are the factory labourers --- have a culture
of their own. Their power of understanding political
and economical issues and suggesting proper remedies in
a practical manner is well-known to those who have
worked for and with them. Their political instincts are
clear and strong. The factor to be borne in mind is that
the Indian labourers loathe the idea of slavery in any
form or shape, and they want to have schools for their
children, houses for themselves, better wages and shorter
hours --- all as a matter of right and justice. The efforts
on the part of the employer or the Government to
patronise them are disliked and resented. The Indian
labourer feels that he is not only a "hand" but also that
he has a head and a heart, and he aspires to come into
his own.

Now under the proposed scheme a factory manager,
a shop-owner, a planter can not only vote but get elected
to the Council Chamber from his Chamber of Commerce,
his trades association, or his planter's association. In
Madras 13 seats are unalloyed capitalist seats. Take
Bombay: The Millowners Association returns a member,
but their employees have no representation, Under the
system of Franchise recommended by the Southborough
Committee the labourers will not be able to influence the
election.

The Joint Committee should enable the Indian
labourer to send his own representatives to the Provincial
Legislatures. To include him or his brother on the
land or in the mine in a general electorate would be the
best plan. A suggestion was made by a society in
Madras on this basis, and the number worked out at
something like 4,000,000 to be enfranchised in the one
Presidency alone. Observing the way in which the res
forms are shaping themselves and advocating the enfranchisement
of the factory labourers especially, I make
two suggestions which I have given in my Memorandum.
I do not think I could put them more shortly than I
have put them in my Memorandum.

There is only one more point I would like to put
before the Committee, and that is on the question of the
much discussed non-Brahmana problem. Having
worked among those 20,000 labourers in Madras, w bo
are mostly non-Brahmana, I beg to bring to the notice
of the Committee, that there is no feeling against the
Brahmanas amongst the poor people in Madras. I do
not think, my Lord, I have anything more to say.

## MR. SPOOR

You are over here I believe, as delegate to the
Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress ? ... I am.

And you have been received and recognised by
those two bodies ?. ... I think so. I have not yet had
an official answer from the Trades Union Parliamentary
Committee, but I hope to have it in a day or two.
In the first part of the Memorandum, the statement
rather, you have submitted to-day, you refer to the
Union you have formed in Madras. How many members
have you got in that Union ? ... Altogether
in those five Unions about 20,000 people.

Twenty thousand people confined to Madras. How
long is it since you began to form that Union ? ... About
sixteen or seventeen months now.

Have you reason to believe that in the days that
lie ahead you will be able to build up a trade union
movement among factory workers in India? ... I think
so. I can speak there with a certain amount of confidence
because, as I say in my Memorandum, I have
had invitations from various centres like Calcutta, Bombay,
Cawnpore, Lucknow, and so on where factories in
good shape and on a large scale exist and where the
labourers are anxious to be organised. Work even now
is going ahead.

Ofcourse, we understand that about 90 per cent of
the workers in India are agricultural workers ; do
you think it will ever be possible to associate them
together in any kind of trade union? ... I
think so, and I think at a very early date --- in fact
I had, just before I started, a few requests, one especially
from the district of Cuddalore in the Madras Pres.
where agricultural labourers are anxious to unite themselves
into a trade union.

Will this movement go pretty much along western
lines ? ... I should think so.

I ask that question because we are constantly re
minded that any comparison between industrial conditions
in India and industrial conditions, say, in this
country or in other parts of Europe is quite impossible,
I know it has been suggested now more than once, that
really improvidence is responsible for the evil conditions
which exist in certain parts of India rather than any
individual or collection of individuals? ... I do not
think so. I think the masses in India have of late
taken very great interest in their own welfare and also
is the big general problems that concerned Indian
people, and one of the signs of the times is the desire on
their part to unite themselves; and I think the movement
will, on the whole, go along the lines of trade
unions here.

You state that the law in India does nothing at all
with regard to the regulation of wages ? ... That is so.
You have however factory inspection ? ... Yes; but
as I say, it is more or less superficial.

You give in your first Memorandum that was issued
some time ago a comparison here between the wages?
... That is not the Memorandum I have given to this
Committee but to the Trade Union Congress.

That is so --- I beg your pardon. In that Memoramdum
you give a comparison between the wages paid,
which run down to twelve shillings a month in the jute
mills and the dividend paid to the shareholders in various
companies, with, I imagine, Indian as well as European
shareholders ? ... Yes.

Does that rather striking contrast (because I see
that some of the dividends run up to 120 per cent) influence
feeling to any great extent amongst the workers
themselves ? ... It does; more and more through the help
of the vernacular newspapers these things come to be
known amongst the labourers and the workmen in factories
and in mines, causing discontent that while they are
labouring the profits go to the employers of labour and
the labourers do not get their adequate share.

We have heard about the change in India during
recent years, I mean the awakening of a political consciousness
in India. Do you think those economic conditions
have had anything to do with that? ... I think the
economic conditions have mostly to do with that. I
believe that the patience of the Indian masses, both
agricultural and factory-going people, has practically
come to a saturation point, and they cannot go on anymore
without some fundamental change in their conditions.

The point is, assuming that that is correct, do you
believe that the giving of a vote to an increasing number
of industrial workers, increasing as time goes on, will
enable the worker to improve his own condition ?  ...
Certainly: Because be will be able to send bis OWB
representative into the Provincial Councils, and will
practically compel his representatives to bring in measures
which will better bis condition. If I may illustrate its
take this Factory Act which is in existence, and was last ·
amended in 1911; as I have pointed out during the 40
years this Act has been in existence, since it was first
passed in 1881, it has only been amended twice, once in
1890 or thereabouts, aod in 1908 after the Commission
went its round which ame into force in 1911. Now if
the labourer going into factories had the vote and if he
had his representatives in the Provincial Legislatures,
that thing would not have happened. The Act would
have been amended much more quickly, and certainly in
the year 1918--19 we would not have had the spectacle
of a twelve hour day in the big Indian factories.

You believe that as a matter of common justice the
Indian worker really requires the vote in order to protect
himself ?  ... I think so, Yes.

You offer two or three alternative suggestions here
as to how the electorate might be increased, and I would
like to ask you which of the alternatives you think
yourself would be most suitable? ... Ofcourse I myself,
would prefer that the franchise should be widened altogether
for all the poor people and the most unfortunate
agricultural labourer and the mine worker ; but as I
pointed out, and it has been very carefully worked out
by the Neo-Fabian Society of Madras, in the Madras
Presidency alone, on that supposition of a wide franchise,
the figure would come to 4,000,000. That compares,
from the point of view of the Southborough Report, very
unfavourably, because they give only a few thousands
there. So that, having to keep that in mind and the
Bill as it is framed and as it stands at present, I myself,
as I say in my Memorandum, reluctantly abandoned the
4,000,000. Then I give, from the point of view of the
factory labourer two schemes, one which enables him to
elect a representative of his own on a wage-earning
qualification, and I suggest a certain figure of 15 rupees
for the Madras Presidency. That figure I have given
tentatively, because on account of various reasons, I think
it will presently be raised, but at any rate it is my opinion
that we must fix a particular wage-earning capacity,
different perhaps in different cities, because the wages
are higher in Calcutta and Bombay.

Just interrupting you a moment. It is correct that
the Bombay Government did ascertain the figures of
wage earners above a certain amount with a view to
recommending their being given the franchise ? ...I have
heard that: how far it is true I am not in a position
authoritatively to say, but I have heard it.

What you are really seeking is not so much the
addition of these people to the electorate as a class,
you are not asking for class representation so much as
you are wishful to extend the franchise generally? ... Yes :
but as I say, if that is not possible, and I can quite see
that at this stage it may not be possible, then on behalf
of my factory-going labourer I claim that his case ought
to be specially considered, and for this reason; that in
the general franchise which has been framed, by Lord
Southborough's Committee, the whole basis has been
naturally the present agricultural labourer, because 90
per cent of our population is agricultural. Every time
you consider the proposition of the franchise you
will have to take that into consideration, so that while
their case has been considered I submit that the case of
the labourer, working in the big factories in big towns,
has not been considered. There is one thing to be said
for the factory-going labourer in the towns.

## CHAIRMAN

Did you give evidence before the Franchise Committee?
...No. I was not called.

Did you ask to be called ? ... No, I did not.

Was not that rather a mistake? ... It did not occur
to me to speak specially on behalf of the Indian labourer
as a separate class.

## Mr. SPOOR

I just want to ask one more question : Assuming
that the Committee cannot see its way to grant
an extension of the franchise at once, as you suggest,
do you think that the promise of an extension of
the franchise, say, when the second election came along
--- if it was incorporated in the Act when the next election
came it would be on a proper Franchise? Do you think
that would in any way meet the desires of the organizations
you represent and of the public opinion that you
have been voicing here? ... If it is definitely promised and
incorporated in the statute so that we are sure that at
the next election we --- that is the labourers working in
factories --- would have their representatives on the Provincial
Councils, I think to a certain extent, not altogether,
it would meet the desires and wishes of the
labourers I have the honour to represent.

But what you really want is to have the franchise
widened immediately, if at all possible ? ... That is of
course what would be the first and best thing I would ask
for. But when you are speaking of promises I would
not be satisfied with a promise which is not absolutely
incorporated in the Statute, as it comes to be framed, so
that at the next step we are sure of getting in as a matter
of course.

## SIR J. D. REES

May I ask you one or two questions? But not to
approach you like a wolf in sheep's clothing, I must say
that I am a director of railways, mines and tea and coffee
estates in India. You have only 20,000 in your unions
in Madras ? ... In the city of Madras, Yes.

It is the day of small things in that respect ? Yes.
You had what you yourself described as a well-managed
strike at the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills. ?
No, there was no strike but there were two lock-outs in
the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills. The strikes I
referred to were of the tramwaymen.

You referred to various causes which are likely to
give trouble in labour --- forces let loose by the war and
the Russian Revolution which have widened and colour
ed the political outlook. So far as your association is
concerned did you point out the appalling results of the
Russian Revolution ? ... Yes: All the vernacular newspapers
and the English newspapers naturally give the
reports of whatever is appearing in your English papers
and all the ghastly reports which have appeared about
the Russian Revolution have been copied in the Indian
papers.

You yourself would not conceal those results from
your people? ... No, certainly not.

You speak of the excessive hours and the premature
exhaustion and so forth. Does that come to you really
as the result of complaints or from the observation of
yourself and your friends ? ...As complaints reached me
from labourers working in a few of the mills, I made investigations
and researches at first hand, and then, as
the result of them we decided to form a labour Union,
and we have been working at it for the last sixteen
months.

Have you in mind always the danger that too much
or too sudden action of the character you indicate might
check the influx of British capital which I think you will
agree is very desirable in India ? ... I do not know that I
would fully agree with that statement; it would take as
altogether into a new line of thought.

I do not wish to raise any economic question at all;
if you do not think the influx of British capital into,
India beneficial, I have no more to ask you about that;
I think your attitude is, that it is not beneficial is it not?

## CHAIRMAN

Mr. Wadia did not say that; he said that it was a
large question, and that he could not answer in one sentence
? ...I would have to cover a fair plot of ground.

## SIR J. D. REES

Could you not say whether you thought it was beneficial
or not? His Lordship does not mean to check
you ? ...From one point of view it is beneficial, but from
various other points of view, also, it is pot beneficial.

On the whole which weighs most ? ...Unless a certain
amount of reform is introduced in the method of
bringing in of British capital, I would rather not have
British capital as matters stand at present.

You demur to the reservation of the settlement of
labour disputes do you not ? ... Yes.

I am not quite clear about that. Do you feel that
if different Local Governments can deal with a question
like that, it would be possible, so far as Government
intervention occurred, if it must occur, to establish anything
like uniformity of treatment ? ...The question first
to settle is this : Do you want, and that is what I am
really driving at in my question, do you desire that the
Government in future should be made responsible for
the settlement of disputes between private capitalists
and private labour ? You have to recognize the new
power that is now springing up of the united action
of trade unions ; for instance, during the two strikes that
we have had with the tramway men in Madras, and the
two locks out that we have had in the Buckingham and
Carnatic Mills in Madras, the Government did not think
fit to interfere; it left the conditions as they stood, and
all the interference that we got --- and I think very wisely
got --- was from the Police Commissioner, who saw that
things did not go into excess; but they do not ever settle
disputes.

But you think they did well ? ...I think they did well.

So do I. --- Now as to the future, if the settlement of
labour disputes is a reserved subject in all the provinces,
and if the trade unions should claim the right to speak,
as I believe they will, then I do not see how we can
reconcile these two points ...I think the trade unions will
claim a certain right and privilege to speak on behalf of
their labourers in the settlement of any disputes that
arise.

Do you contemplate the development in India,
whether for good or bad, which has been so marked in
Europe of the general interference of the Government
in the settlement of labour disputes ? ...I hope that we
may not come to such a point, and to safeguard that, as
I pointed out in my memorandum, we are already, at
this very early stage, building up what in Madras we have
called a Labour Board, where we try to get the representatives
of the employers and the representatives of the
trade unions to come together and work independently of
the Government. As I suggest the Government might
limit their action to the creation of such Labour Boards.

You say that in the Bill before as you find so
attempt to introduce any measure of reform which will
give the labourer any voice in safeguarding his own interests.
You mean by that the Franchise proposals
are pot such as to give him a representation ? ... Yes.

You know that special representation is given to
Indian commerce through the agency of the Indian
Chamber of Commerce ? ...Yes, but I may point out that
I 10 not here putting forward a claim on behalf of the
Indian merchant. The Indian landlord is a capitalist,
and the Indian merchant is a capitalist also.

You say is there any way to bring the Indian
labourer into power, you mean power to deal with his
owo interests ? ...Yes

You say that their political instincts are clear and
strong. You really feel that? ... Yes, from my personal
experience at these various Labour Unions, I think I
can safely say that their political instincts are strong
and their judgment sound and full of common sense.

You did not make this recommendation as to the
occupants of houses and premises (this is the one you
chiefly rely upon) of the annual rental value of 48 rupees
in towns and 24 rupees outside, and so on anywhere ? ...
Yes, it was published in a little transaction of the Neo
Fabian Society of Madras, which I hold in my hand
Those are my data.

And you think that the Madras Government
adopted a very obstinate and retrogressive attitude to
wards you ? ... That is my opinion.

What is the authority for the figure --- it may be
perfectly right, but it astonishes me --- that the total
number of workers in large industrial establishments is
17½ millions? ... It is in the Statistical Abstract of British
India, which the India Office publishes.

. I can look that up for myself. You propose that all
labourers working in factories and earning a particular
wage should be given the vote, and then you make certain
proposals : Again, were they laid before the Madras
Government when they were making their recommendations
? --- No.

Then you finish your very interesting memorandum,
if I may venture to so describe it, by saying
that in Madras, Muslims, Indian Christians, and
Panchamas work harmoniously together for their own
welfare, and no Brahmana or non-Brahmana question
has ever arisen, which is a ridiculous movement started
by some interested people, but that workers will not
allow caste questions to affect their labour work,
which is also true of politics. ... Yes : and I have given
an instance one of the best cases of the inter-dining
about which so much has been talked. You see
that at a dinner of 200 people, including Brahmanas,
and Panchamas, the left and right extremes, they come
together, and as far as our Labour Union's works are
concerned, they have found absolutely no difficulty.

I thank you very much, and I want to say how
deeply I agree with you in what you have just said.

## LORD SINHA

Mr. Wadia, are your present proposals directed to
enfranchise labour as such ? ...Factory .*going labour as
such.

That is in towns I suppose ? ...In towns mostly.

Practically the biggest towns like Calcutta, Bombay
Madras and Cawnpore ? ...Yes, and also there may be a
certain number of smaller towns in Madras and the
Bombay Presidency, where there are factories and mills.

Would not they come in under the Franchise laid
down for big municipalities and towns by payment of
municipal taxes ? ...I do not think under the Franchise
scheme of Lord Southborough's Committee for instance
the labourers of Madras would come in.

The payment is something very small is it not ? ...
Yes, but when you come to think of it, when a weaver
in Madras earns between 15 and 20 rupees a month, it
is not likely that you will get people --- as there are others
earning still less in the carding and spinning departments,
--- to be able to pay municipal taxes to that extent.
I speak there tentatively because I have not made enquiries
into it.

You have not considered as to whether the Franchise
recommended by the Southborough Report would enfranchise
the labour population in those big industrial
centres, or to what extent ? ...No; I have not gone in a
direct fashion into the matter. Under the recommendations
that have been made, certain municipal rates and
taxes have to be paid. Now I do not think that the
ordinary labourer iz Madras would be in a position from
the earning capacity that he possesses to pay those
taxes.

Would they come in under the rural franchise,
because I understand most of these people labour only
in the factories for a portion of the year and go back to
the land during the rest of the year ? ...Well, that is so
to a very limited extent, and the Indian factory labour is
getting less than less in that direction. It is not that for
a few months they work in the factories, and they go
away, but rather that for a few years they work in the
factories and then go away.

At any rate your position is that the Franchise proposals
of the Southborough Committee do not enfranchise
the labourers in those industries ? ... That is so.

You would not put it higher than that ? ...I would
not put it more emphatically than that because I have
ao first band information on the subject.

## CHAIRMAN

You would not say that you had sufficiently
examined the facts and figures with regard to Madras to
see how far they would have affected your view of the
Franchise proposals 2 ...No; I read the Franchise
Report after leaving India, and I have written to
Madras, and in the course of a few weeks we may get
some information, and if it comes I presume that
I may send it to your Lordship?
Chairman ...Certainly.

## LORD ISLINGTON

Have you arrived at any idea of the number of
agricultural labourers who will get the vote under the
Southborough proposals ? ...I should think that the whole
number that is given in the Southborough Committee's
Report, would bring a portion of the agriculturists,
whether they be landlords or peasant proprietors.

I am asking about labourers. Out of 500,000 odd
electors to be established in Madras under the South
borough proposals, how many of those should you say
would be agricultural labourers ? ... The actual figure of
the electors is 542,000.

How many of those would be agricultural labourers ?
...I cannot say. I am not prepared to give the figure.

Have you aay idea whether it would be an appreciable
figure at all 7 ...Of those 542,000?

Yes, of the $42.000 proposed to have votes, would
you say that the agricultural labourer as such would have
any appreciable representation ? ...He would have some
representation, but I would not say appreciable representation.
There however I speak very tentatively, because
I have not looked into the figures carefully, as I just
said.

You have looked into the question of the factories ?
... Yes.

And as far as you can see under those proposals there
would be no representation ? ...As I say, when you take
into consideration that 15 rupees is the wage-earning
capacity of the weaver in textile factories which is
higher in Bombay and Calcutta then you will see as I
have just said in reply to Lord Sinha's question, be is not
in a position to pay that municipal rate or tax, and thus
be will pot be able to come into the number.

How many do you say that you estimate would get
votes if the basis were fifteen rupees month? --- Have
you worked it out? You say that 4,000,000 would be
too many in proportion to the number proposed ? ... Yes

Then you proceed on the other suggestions ? ...Yes.

One of those suggestions, as I understand it, is alternative
to the original proposal, but for Madras would you
suggest that every labourer earning fifteen rupees a
month in a factory should get the vote? ...Io the City of
Madras.

How many do your think would get the vote on that
qualification? ...Between 20,000 and 25,000 people in
the City of Madras would get extra votes who are
labourers.

You are anxious to see the Services which deal
with these factory and mine administrations transferred
subjects ? ...Yes.

Would you like to see them transferred subjects if
the present electorate was established without any re
presentation ? ...Yes, certainly, because as I put for.
ward tbe plea in my Memorandum, the Indian Minis
ters would be in a better position to understand and
therefore to deal with the troubles which are existing now,
than the official executive. Already in the past, the ad
ministration has had the chance of improving the
factory legislation and of dealing with this problem, and
my contention is that they have not done sufficient for
the factory labourer.

Have many efforts been made in the Provincial
Councils on the part of Indian members to get ameliorative
legislation from the Government ? ... Not many as
far as Madras is concerned : and that again is because
there is no representative of the labourers in the
Provincial Legislatures as at present constituted.

So that you would admit that these subjects, be
coming transferred subjects, would be incomplete in what
you would like to see them realise, unless coupled with
them was a worker's electorate ? ...That would be the
first factor I would pat forward. But even supposing that
nothing is done to enfranchise the factory labourer, if
No. 25 of the subjects is transferred instead of being
kept reserved, the Indian minister will have to deal with
the subject, and he will be able to deal with it better
than the official executive That is my view, especially
as No. 24. which is the development of industries, including
industrial research and technical education is to
be transferred. That is going to be a transferred
subject and the legislation regarding the welfare of
labour and regarding other things connected with the
factory is kept a reserved subject and my contention
is that both should be transferred.

## MR. ACLAND

I forget for the moment the numbers that you told
us belonged to your Unions? ... Roughly, 20,000, of the
five Unions

Can you tell us what proportion of those are literate?
... Literate in the sense of reading and writing ?

Yes ? ...I think on the whole, perhaps, you will find
a few hundreds who can read or write.

Is that proportion increasing or tending to increase?
...It would be, to give my own personal experience, too
short a time to judge; but I think from the general
movement that is taking place in India it is on the
increase, I have come into contact with them for the
last sixteen or eighteen months, and it is too soon for me
to say whether it is appreciably increasing.

Do you know of any movement that is taking place
in Madras to found schools or anything of that kind,
where they would learn to read and write ? ...Since the
establishment of the Labour Unions we have done certain
constructive work, like opening dispensaries, selling rice
and others stores, and a night-school for the labourers
and there are other night schools in the vicinity of the
Mills now.

There is just one thing I would like to understand
about the ordinary life of men of this class. You said
that generally they spent some years of their lives ia
working in a factory in the town and other years in the
agricultural districts. I am much impressed with the
low rate of wages you quote to us. Is the general
system that they come in and do the work in the factories
for a certain number of years until they have earned and
accumulated a certain amount of money which they carried
back to their country districts, or is it, as one would
perhaps be more led to think from your evidence, the fact
that they appreciate life in the town so much that they
come in from the country with the money they have made
in the country, until they have spent it all in supplementing
their wages in the town ? ...I think I can explain that
in this way: Generally the factory labourer is some kind
of an agriculturist in a village. He is there living under
very bad conditions, with an increasing debt and so
forth, and then, out of sheer impatience, he makes the
change in the hope of making some money and goes to a
factory. He works there for a few years under the
conditions, and then I believe, and I think it can be pro
ven from records, on account of the severe conditions
under which he has to work, he retires after a few years
broken down in health.

Without being able to save much money ? ...Yes :
and that produces the very curious phenomenon which
was observed by two Commissions appointed by the
Government, that they did not find labourers in the factories
above the age of forty as a rule. That is due to the
premature exhaustion which steps in on account of the
factory conditions.

## MR. BENNET

Mr. Wadia, do you know the industrial conditions
of Bombay as well as those of Madras ? ...Not so well of
Bombay as of Madras.

You are member of a well-known Bombay family,
are you not ? ... Yes.

I thought so. Will you give me your view of the
manner in which the Mill owners of Bombay as a class
--- they own something like eighty Mills do they not? --- have
performed their duties towards those whom they employ?
... Some of them have done very well by their labourers.
It is a very interesting question because it relates to the
Dew conditions that are arising in India. The labourer
Dow is not satisfied to take better conditions as a matter
of favour which the Indian capitalist in Bombay is
willing to provide for him. I know of instances of Mills
owned by Indian capitalists who make admirable arrangements
for their labourers in several mills. I cannot
speak the same of all mills --- but when you take into consideration
the wages which are actually earned by the
Bombay labourer and the dividends which are declared
by some mills, you will see where the grievance of the
labourer lies. He wants something as a matter of right
and not as a matter of patronage.

Would you call that patronage which the great firm
of Tata have exhibited in their mills in Central India
where, as you know, 'they have established welfare
'schemes ; they have taken welfare experts from this
country to assist them in establishing welfare mills ? ...
Yes.

You speak in rather an ungracious way of services.
of that kind rendered by employers. However, I do not
think it is very relevant to the question. You represent,
I think, five establishments in Madras. Have the people
employed there shewn any capacity for organising for
what we call nowadays self-government? ... Yes. In those
Unions we have various organising committees for
various kinds of work and managing committees to carry
on the work of the Unions, which are entirely .composed
of the labourers themselves. They elect their own
representatives, they plan out their own work, and they
carry through the work and really what I do for them
there is to plead their cause and their grievances in
public, and generally to keep the movement going from
outside, but the entire work of organisation of those
Unions is carried out by the men themselves, and
visitors have been surprised at the intelligence and
capacity which those labourers have displayed.

I do not want to put it in an invidious way, as you
will understand, but could they possibly have done without
you ? Could they have organised themselves and
placed themselves before the public without you ? ...I
doubt it.

In your Memorandum you say that you have had
invitations from Calcutta, Bombay and various
other places to organise their unions. Does not that
seem to suggest that there is at all events an: imperfect
capacity for organisation among the labourers themselves
? ...The labourers themselves, yes; but at the
same time you must bear in mind this, that any
particular set of labourers who come forward to
organise trade unions at the present moment in India
would be marked men and would naturally suffer in
their factories and in all organisations to which they
belonged.

You think there is organising capacity among the
people ? ... I am sure of it.

Do you infer from that they would be capable
of organising themselves for political purposes? --- I should
think so. yes.

We were asked the other day why it was that there
was no representation of labour. I think it was
Bombay factory labour, but labour atrial events, upon
Lord Southborough's Committee. Would it have been
possible to have found a single man in one of the
mills who, if he had been selected for that Committee,
could have spoken English or any language which was
common to the whole of his colleagues ? ... If the language
bar could be removed I am sure that you could
find men in Bombay. I have now in mind a man in
Madras who could very well advise such a committee
as the Southborough Committee, if his own language
Tamil, or Hindustani was spoken. He would not be
able perhaps to talk of subjects which were outside his
province, and would not be able to advise, say, on
Agriculture or other matters.

Let us carry that to the Legislative Council. You
speak of the language bar; do you think you could have
found a mill hand in Bombay who could have taken bis
place in the Legislative Council, where of course English
is the official language? Do you think you could have
found a man ? ...No.

You would have had to go outside the mills to get
a labourer's representative. ...Yes, at the present moment
that would happen. Supposing you give the vote to the
factory labourers in Bombay, Calcutta or Madras at
the present moment, I think an outsider would have to
represent them.

As to their power to form opinions and to guide the
representative, is it not the case that the factory hands
in India are in a peculiar sense a gregarious people
and follow their leaders, very often not knowing what
they are doing and what they are following ? ... I should
not think so. From my own experience, and I have had
to deal as I have said with two lock-outs and two strikes
in a short period of 16 months, I can tell you that it
took us many hours of discussion and debate to come to
a settlement. They are not in a position to follow very
meekly, and to say yea to everything their leaders say.
They are rather given to a thorough discussion and debate
of the points which are raised, and to come to an
agreement after certain discussion.

## MAJOR ORMSBY-GORE

I take it that you suggest that if this Committee
cannot see its way to widen the Franchise so as to include
factory bands, we should try to make one or two
special constituencies in the towns where there are
mills and to give a special franchise to the factory
worker. That is your alternative. Would you suggest that
that Franchise should form, as it were, another communal
electorate, or do you wish them thrown in with
the rest of the voters to vote as part of the general
constituency ? ...I would not mind at all their being
thrown into the general electorate, provided that they
bad the vote, because they would be able to influence
the election.

Do you think it would be just as valuable to them
to have votes for ore of the ordinary politicians as it
would be for them to have a definite representative of
their own ? ... Yes : because I am sure that the labourers
will extract good terms from the ordinary politician
before they send him into the Provincial Councils.

Now for this experiment you suggest --- that it should
be applied in about five great towns ? ...Well, I have
suggested a wage-earning capacity for large industrial
establishments, and I think it would be more than five
towns.

About how many people would be enfranchised, do
you think, in Calcutta ? ...As I said, I have no data for
that yet.

## CHAIRMAN

If you get the further information you have referred
10 later, you will kindly serd it in ? ... I will do so
my Lord.

***

\ 

| 
| To the Rt. Hon, the Earl ot Selborne,
| President,
| Joint Select Committee on Draft Rules under the Government of India Act, 1919.

\ 

My Lord,

\ 

I had the honour of appearing as a witness before
the Joint Committee presided over by you on August 12, 1919.
My evidence is recorded in the volume of Minutes
of Evidence, pp. 201--208.

Representing the Madras Labour Union, I drew the
attention of the Committee to the necessity of enfranchising
the wage-earning factory-going workers. In a
statement submitted to that Committee two schemes
were put forward to achieve that end.

The Report of the Joint Select Committee recommended
the enfranchisement of wage earners in
cities. The Report says: "They also think that an
attempt should be made to secure better representation
of the urban wage-earning classes." (Page 7).

The Government of India in their Draft Rules have
endeavoured to respond to this recommendation, and the
wage-earners of Bombay and Calcutta have been enfranchised
to a very meagre extent. This cannot be
regarded as satisfactory, and yet a beginning has been
made, for which, as a friend of Indian Labour, let me
record my grateful thanks to your Lordship's Committee
and the Government of India.

It is, however, a matter of great disappointment that
the Government of India have not extended even this very
limited franchise to wage-earners in other cities like
Cawnpore, Ahmedabad, and Madras. Why this anomalous
distinction is made between Bombay and Calcutta
and other industrial centres is not clear. The recommendation
referred to above inspired hope in the minds
of the working classes, and that has been unfortunately
destroyed by the Draft Rules.

Some arguments were put forward by me last year
in support of the enfranchisement of the wage-earner.
Those arguments remain true to-day, and if the principle
is accepted as right in the cases of Bombay and Calcutta,
it is also right in the case of the Southern capital
Madras, and such important centres as Ahmedabad and
Cawnpore. In Madras labour is better organised than
elsewhere in India. The first Labour Union was founded
in Madras in April 1918. That Union was of the
textile workers of Madras, consisting of thousands of men
and has showed its efficacy in several ways: it was the
pioneer institution which decided that its representative
should bring to the notice of the British public the very
unsatisfactory conditions of Labour in India. It was
principally on behalf of that Union that I came before
your Lordship's Committee last year. As President of the
Madras Labour Union, I beg to draw particular attention
to the disadvantage to which that Union of textile workers
is put, and with all the force that I can command re-request
that the Joint Select Committee over which your
Lordship is now presiding should remove the disability
imposed on the wage earners of Madras textile industry
by the Draft Rules. However small, a beginning has been
made in Bombay and Calcutta, and it is not only desirable
but necessary in the interests of fair-play that a
similar beginning be made in the capital of the large
Southern Presidency.

In Madras, commerce and industry return no less
than five members to the Provincial Legislative Council.
Under the Act, capitalists will form a powerful element
in the Madras Council, and even the nominal device to
be utilised in the case of Bombay and Calcutta is pot
proposed for Madras. This is very undesirable for in
it one cannot but see the seed of future trouble in Madras.

In my evidence last year I referred to the growing
restlessness of Indian labour. May I draw your Lord
ship's attention and that of your Committee to the fact
that during the last few months there have been a number
of strikes, some of them very serious, in Sholapur,
Ahmedabad, Bombay, Madras, Jamshedpur, Lahore, etc.
Also, may I point out that the textile workers of Madras,
with their Union, have not gone on strike ? Perhaps for
the reason that we passed through a satisfactory struggle
in 1918. Further, that when those men of the Madras
Union were struggling there was no manifestation of
disorderly conduct. If that be so, are the Madras textile
workers to be penalised for their enterprise in organising
themselves? Or is it reasonable to suppose that their
good conduct will continue if they feel that they have
been discriminated against in the matter of the franchise?
Hence, may I suggest that it is very essential
that a beginning should be made in Madras similar to
that in the two other Presidencies? I sincerely trust that
this appeal on behalf of the textile workers of Madras will
find favour with your Lordship's Committee.
