My Dear Friend,

This is your book as much as mine. If the
speeches delivered here achieved any good among our
friends at Perambur it is due to your excellent translations
of them. What could I have done in the
Labour work in this city without you? You translated
my speeches---not my words merely but their very
spirit. We have rejoiced and suffered together with
thousands. Your unobtrusive manner, your loyal
support, your sagacious advice have been priceless. Let
me request you to accept this small gift of dedication
for your all too splendid services.

| Ever yours,
| B. P. WADIA
