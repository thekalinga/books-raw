# APPENDIX II

A memorandum on "Labour Problems in India" issued
to the Trades Union Congress held at Glasgow in
September 1919, by Mr. B. P. Wadia.

Labour conditions in India. are exceptional, for in
that vast country labour is not organised; it is exploited
by the capitalistic class ; its interests are not watched
by the Government; the working hours are extremely
long; the wages are miserably low; the housing problem
is in the stage of mere academic and theoretic discussion.
The only place where recently an effort has been made
to organise labour is the city of Madras, where five
Unions have been formed --- the Madras Labour Union,
Madras Tramwaymen's Union, Madras Rickshawallas
Union, Madras Printers' Union and Madras Railway
Workshop Union. I am the President of the first of these
and am in Great Britain as a representative of all of
them (Sub Appendix A.) I come here as a fraternal
delegate to the Labour Party and the Parliamentary
Committee of the Trades Union Congress (Sub Appendix
B.)

Though labour conditions in India are exceptional
they do not warrant Indian labour representation being
shut out at the International Labour Conference which
is to meet at Washington in the course of a few weeks
The tendency of the official policy is to regard Indian
labour as subservient to the industrial development of
India. Such an attitude may obscure the fact that Indian
labour will be allowed to be exploited as hitherto. Capitalistic
exploitation, in the name of growing Indian
Industries, has already taken place, and that ought not
to be permitted any longer. The welfare of the Indian
labourer should not be sacrificed for the sake of "growing
industries"; the betterment of his lot should not be relegated
to a second place, and a primary position given to
the improvement and growth of young or new industries.

## HOURS

The last inquiry into factory conditions in India was
conducted in 1908, as a result of which the Factories
Act was amended in 1911. That Act is now in force.
_The Report of the Indian Factory Labour Commission_
admits that "in textile factories excessive hours are
frequently worked in cotton mills: in all jute mills
weavers are employed for excessive hours, and it
makes mention of seventeen ard eighteen hours a day in
ginning factories (P. 82): twenty to twenty-two hours
in rice and flour mills (P. 82), the textile factories of
Bombay working for fourteen hours or more" (P. 82),
those in Ahmedabad and Broach working in summer for
fourteen hours and more (P. 80), mills in Agra working
fifteen and a quarter hours per day in summer, and
thirteen and three-quarter hours in winter (P.82), factories
in Delhi working "fourteen, and even fourteen and a half
hours" (P.82). What was the outcome of the Report ?
The Act was amended, and now "no person shall be
employed, in any textile factory for more than twelve
hours in any one day"(_Indian Factories Act_, Chap. V.,
para. 28). A textile factory can employ a labourer for
twelve hours per day for six days of the week, i, 6., seventy-two
hours per week. What is the recess in this twelve
hours working-day? The Act provides that half-an-hour's
recess should be given to the worker (Chap. IV, para
21). This thirty minutes period is divided between three
functions --- going out of the mills, taking a meal and
returning to the mills. Careful observations carried on
in Madras where arrangements are better than in other
Mills (I am referring to the Buckingham and Carnatic
Mills.) showed that a man does aot get more than twelve
to thirteen minutes for his actual meal.

The twelve hours day with its ridiculous thirty
minutes recess bas another side. The workmen in almost
all cases live miles away from factories, and as was rightly
pointed out by an I. C. S. officer recently, "from the
standpoint of the worker, the time in going to and
returning from the factory must be added to the length
of his active day." In Bombay, where tram and train
services are available, one hour at the least must be added,
and I know instances, in Madras, where the distance has
to be walked, that labourers have to leave home at 4--30
A. M. to be at the factory gate at 5--45, and do not reach
home till 8 p. m.

The result of this excessive long hours system is far-reaching.
It tells on the efficiency of the work; it produces
the phenomenon peculiar to Indian factory labour
--- viz., loitering; it leads to premature exhaustion; it drives
the Indian labourer away from the factory, as "the operative
becomes unable to stand the strain of work under
present conditions at a comparatively early age." (_Indian
Factory Labour Commission Report_, p. 27.) Dr. T. M.
Nair, in his Minute of Dissent to the Commission Report
characterises the system thus: "A system more likely to
bring about degradation of labour is impossible to
conceive."

## WAGES

I am in a position to give some detailed figures of
payment received by workmen in textile factories, which
go to prove the miserably low wages prevalent in India.
It may be contended that living in India is cheap; but
when the rise in the prices of foodstuffs and clothing
material is taken into account (for this see _Rise in
Prices_, a Government publication, the result of a careful
study by K, B. Dutt, I. C. S.), when a personal inquiry
into the lives of the workmen is made, and when we see
the hovels they live in, the food they eat, the clothes they
wear, and remember that they are _always in debt_, which
is ever-increasing, we cannot but come to the inevitable
conclusion that the scale of wages is scandalously low
and is absolutely inadequate to meet the demands of
sheer existence at the present time. It is said that
the standard of living of the Indian workman is low.
It is necessary to remember in this connection that
the wage allowed him leads to malnutrition and
that the latter has to be remedied before a better
standard of living, housing, clothing, & c., can
be thought of. The Indian labourer may be addicted to
living cheaply; but the most frugal temperament would
not choose malnutrition and all its consequences, for the
sake of cheap living; and further, what about the debt
the labourer is constantly incurring? Low wages.
compel him to borrow at high rates of interest, and with
the help of his miserable earnings plus his borrowed
money he manages to exist. Life in dingy hovel on
scanty food shows the courage and patience of the
Indian labourer. Malnutrition is provable, and all I
need to do is to copy the following table, which shows
that prisoners in Indian jails are better nourished than
the Indian operatives. This explains the remark of the
manager of a big Nagpur factory that "those accustomed
to mill life regard it as worse than jail life." (Indian
Factory Labour Commission Report, p. 90.)

:STATEMENT SHOWING THE AVERAGE WEIGHTS OF PRISONERS AND OF MILL OPERATIVES.[^report]

_Average weight of prisoners in the United Province is: 115.8 lbs._

_Average weight of prisoners in the Rajahmundry Central Jail, Madras, generally, 114.38 lbs._

[^report]: _Indian Factory Labour Commission Report_, APPENDIX C.

>NOTE: In Bengal probably the most accounts comparison
is with prisoners in the United Province ; in Burma
with prisoners in Madras generally, and more particularly
, with prisoners in the Rajahmundry Central Jail,
which is situated in the tract from which the majority of
the Madras labourers in Burma are recruited.

The problem of wages was not examined by the
Factory Commission of 1908. The Member of the
Indian Civil Service quoted above says, "Labour may
be cheap, but life is not," and it is not difficult to prove
that India suffers, in more ways than one, on account of
the scandalous wages paid to the labourer ; this happens
when all the time the capitalists are boarding wealth
--- mill agents getting their handsome commissions, and
shareholders their big dividends.

To substantiate these general remarks I give below
a few typical figures which can tell their tale more
eloquently than my words. Take these earnings of workers
in the Cotton Mills of Bombay, of the Jute Mills of Bengal,
of the Leather Works of Cawnpore, etc., and compare
then with wages of Lancashire and Dundee and
other factories in the United Kingdom generally.

These sample rates were prevalent in Bombay in
1918, and include War Bonus. Again, these rates are
in. Bombay, and wages are higher there than in other
places. Against this let me give a few items from the

: Specimen Wages per month in Jute Mills

_Wages are paid weekly, with one week in arrears._

In 1916--17 there were seventy-one mills running
with 39,404 looms, employing 260,199 persons, with a
paid up capital, including debentures, but excluding
reserves amounting to two and a quarter million pounds
sterling. The annual turnout is 1,000,000 tons of raw
material.

The annual average value of the jute trade to
Bengal has been computed at £. 42,000,000 at pre-war
rate of exchange. In this connection the following,
taken from the _Financier_ of August 7, 1918, will be
found instructive : Many commodities are scarce now-a-days
through the want of tonnage to bring them from
foreign countries. A further contributive cause is the
dearth of bags, in which grain, sugar, etc., are shipped ;
the price of jute sacks has accordingly risen to unknown
heights. Hence, the prosperity of the Indian jute companies,
three of which, the Victoria, Titaghur, and Samnugger,
have doubled their dividend to 20 per cent for
the past year, against 10 per cent. for 1916. The shares
are tightly held in Dundee,

: Specimen Wages per month in the Tanneries and Leather Works of Cawnpore

_Specimen Wages to Workman in Coal Mines_ :---

_The average daily wage per bead is 7½ d._

_The annual raisings per head of labour employed below
ground for all India 169.4 tons._

In reference to wages must be mentioned some ways
devised to throw dust in the eyes of the unwary. Some
manufacturers have started what they call a gratuity
fund. Mr. M.C. Sitaraman, a retired weaving master of
the Carnatic Mills of Madras, where this "Gratuity
Fund" is worked, has well described its mode :

>The Gratuity Fund for women is a very ingenious device for
securing constant and steady labour. It has its merits as well
as its faults. A labourer after ten years of satisfactory and _continuous_
service gets between 5 per cent, and 10 per cent. of his
total wages. On the other hand, it turns a workman into an
avaricious and spiritless slave of the system. Desirous of securing
the gratuity fund, a workman gradually loses his self-respect,
puts up with treatments which ander ordinary circumstances
be would have revolted from, and invariably becomes a more beast
to dance to the tunes and insolent whims of his arbitrary superior
in the department. It emasculates the workman and emboldens
the foreman to stretch the exercise of his arbitrary power to the
Vanishing limit. Here I may mention a case that I know which
has a touch of tragedy in its committal. A workman stole a lea (120
yde) of red yarn to make a waist thread. He was found out at
the gate, brought to the manager, who, after referring to the regis
ter, dismissed him without the least concern on his part. Usually
stealing of a trivial nature is punished by the same manager by *
fine of rupee or two. This particular workman had faithfully
served nine years and eight months, and he was to get as his gratuity
a lump sum of Rs. 180 ($ 10) in another four months. The
men, broken-hearted, went home 48 if to his own funeral. I wish
that workmen wbo have put in more than five years of service be
treated more generously than in the above case by the mill
authorities.

## CAPACITY

The inefficiency of the Indian workman is often"
adduced as the cause of low wages. The factory system
in India is already fifty years old, and it is inconceivable
that the Indian workman has made no progress. "India
is the Mother Country of the textile industry and up to
the time of Arkwright possessed the monopoly of fine
yarns"; outside experts like Mr. James Platt and
Mr. Henry Lee are of opinion that "in no country
on earth, except in Lancashire, do the operatives
possess such a natural leaning to the textile industry
as in India"; Dr. G. Von Schultze-Gævernitz, a
German expert, said in 1895 that the Indian labourer
"does not stand far behind the German" --- that was
twenty-five years ago. Dr. Nair in his Minute of Dissent
to the _Report of the Indian Factory Labour
Commission_ says:---

>And at the present time, according to the very careful calculations
made by Mr. Simpson, of Messrs. Binny and Co.,
of Madras, a cotton mill in Madras with 35,000 ring spindles
800 looms, average count 168., working 673 hours a week,
would employ 2,622 operatives all told. Whereas for
similar mill in Lancashire, working 647 hours a week, the
total number of hands required would be 982, which works out a
proportion of 2.62 Indian hands to 1 English band. And if we
also consider that the average monthly wage of a Lancashire operative
will be about Rs. 60 (4), and the average monthly wage of
& Madras operative is Rs. 15 (41), it is clear that _for the
same money the Indian millowner gets nearly double the work that
an English millowner does_ ... Before condemning the Indian
operative as inefficient and incapable of improvement he ought
to be given a fair hearing. In a memorial submitted to Bis
Excellency the Marquis of Lansdowne, Viceroy and Governor--General
of India in 1883, by the mill operatives of
Bombay, it was stated that "it has been said to the detriment
of your petitioner that an Indian mill operative is not as hard.
working as his brother workman in England, and that a mill operative
in England does the work of three men employed on the game
work in an Indian Mill, The real badge of this, your Lordship's.
petitioners submit,is the bad machinery and the bad raw materials
used in the mills. The breakage in the thread is so continuous here
on account of the bad quality of the cotton that mill owners are
compelled to employ more men. As the effect of the long hours bas
to be considered before judging of the idle habits of the Indian operatives,
so the quality of the raw material they have to handle has to
be taken into consideration before the extent of their skillfulness or
otherwise is determined."

It is also very necessary to point out that the so-called
inefficiency of the Indian workman is rooted in a diseased
body, and on "the incessant strain on his nerves
amidst the din and noise of machinery in the stuffy atmosphere
of the factory." Major F. Norman White, M.D.,
I. M. S. Sanitary Commissioner with the Government
of India, writes: "A large part of the relative inefficiency
of the Indian labour is due to removable pathological
causes. "(_Indian Industrial Commission Report,
Appendices to the Report_, Appendix L. p. 164). He
makes a pertinent remark, and I quote it here with a
request that it may be considered in the light of all its
implications "Had the large employer of labour a plentiful
supply of really healthy material to start with, he
would still be under an obligation to secure for his.
operatives an environment above reproach; how much
greater is the present need for hygienic environment,
when in most cases cure has to precede the conservation
of health?" (_Ibid._ p. 160). One more quotation
from this expert is necessary as it is an important
deduction relating to the subject in hand: "All are agreed
that the organised labour of India \[he means factory
labour, not labour organised in trade unions or labour
centres\] is relatively inefficient, and that the wage-earning
capacity is low. It is difficult to assess the importance
of disease as a contributory cause of this state of affairs."
(_Ibid._ p. 160).

## HEALTH AND SANITATION

Progressive sanitation is not a feature of the official
programme. The _Indian Labour Factory Commission
Report_ records how "one witness of long practical
experience stated that any man would feel exhausted
even if he merely sat in a chair in some of the workrooms
for eight or nine hours, the atmosphere was so
foul." Sir Bhalchandra Krishna, an eminent physician
and publicist of Bombay, said to the Commission that
there was physical deterioration among the millhands,
and was careful enough to point out that it is due to bad
ventilation in the mills" (p. 18), Doctor Chavan, a
medical man of Ratnagiri, the district from which a
large number of mill operatives come to Bombay, and
one who has a large practice among them, is of opinion
that "the mill operatives suffer to a very large extent
from phthisis and dyspepsia" (p. 87). The hovels in
which they are compelled to live, the malnutrition which
follows on low earnings, the premature exhaustion caused
by long hours necessitate extraordinary sanitary facilities,
but the Government of India are very backward in
the matter of sanitation, and the necessity of special
factory sanitation has not yet occurred to them. The recently
published _Indian Industrial Commission Report_
includes among its contents a paper on "Industrial
Development and Public Health" by the Sanitary Com.
missioner with the Government of India, in which
the expert says that "the subject of industrial hygiene
has received remarkably little attention in India, until
quite recent times and to-day its importance is not fully
recognised in any part of the country". (Appendix I.,
p. 159).

## EDUCATION

Much has been said of the illiteracy of the Indian
labourer. It is true that the average Indian labourer
is not able to read or write. He and his educated countrymen
have for many years demanded that primary
education should be made free and compulsory, but the
Government of India have failed to respond to that demand.
In fact one of the strongest arguments for the
universal demand in India for Home Rule is the extremely
backward educational policy of the present inefficient
administration. However, it must be noted that
the masses in India --- and among them are the factory
labourers --- have a culture of their own. Their power of
understanding political and economic issues and suggesting
proper remedies in a practical manner is well known
to those who have worked for and with them. Their
political instincts are clear and strong. Their ability to
organise themselves was recently manifested in the
formation of the trade unions in Madras referred to
above, and it will be an agreeable surprise to lovers of
labour in Great Britain to note that a few months ago in
Bombay a general strike of textile workers was declared
and maintained for several days without any trade union
organisation in existence there. That strike involved
some 70,000 labourers. This instance is given to show
that Indian labourers do possess the capacity to combine
and organise effectively.

Lack of education, however, prevails. A few
employers have opened schools for the children of their
employees. Much is made by clever capitalists of such
institutions, and instances are not wanting where the
Government have given prominence to such ventures.
But attention must be drawn to the important fact that
it is one of the devices to enslave labour. To quote a
retired weaving-master, Mr. M. C. Sitaraman, of the
Carnatic Mills at Madras : "The school, general and
technical in character, is the best part of the whole affair
--- the best part of the institute from the manufacturers
point of view This pays him in rupees, annas, pies. This
school trains up boys to become intelligent and skilled
labourers and cooly clerks. This serves as a strong link
of connection as well between the employers and the
employees even ander strained relationship." Even the
_Indian Industrial Commission Report_, published a few
months ago, disposes of the whole problem in two short
paragraphs under the heading "Education of Factory
Children." What hope is there, then for the future?

## HOUSING

As in the matter of education the problem of housing
bas not attracted very serious attention from the
Government. Some manufacturers have started schools
for the children of their employees, so others have put
up chawls and houses for them. They have done this
to secure some permanence in the fluctuating Indian
labour, and as the _Indian Industrial Commission
Report_ says, "in such cases employers have often found
it impossible to obtain labour without providing accommodation;"
and again, "the more enlightened factory
owner has found it advisable to provide accommodation
on an increasing scale recognising that, though the rent
which he can obtain will not pay him more than a
trifling percentage on his outlay, the mill which houses
its labourers best will command the pick of the labour
market, especially in the case of such a fluid labour force
as that on which the textile factories rely" (p. 181).

The actual conditions under which the labourers
live are indescribable. In the City of Bombay
--- Urbs Prima in Indis --- 744,000 working men are
tenanted in one roomed houses; the room is generally
8 feet by 10 feet, and a death rate of 60 per 1,000 is
known to prevail.

## THE MORAL ISSUE

In dealing with the problems of education, housing,
gratuity fund, etc., I may have appeared to be unappreciative
of the manufacturers who have tried to run schools
or build houses or start gratuity funds. The factor to be
borne in mind in this connection is the innate culture
of the Indian labourer, which loathes the idea of slavery
in any shape or form. The Indian labourers want to
have schools for their children, houses for themselves,
better wages and shorter hours --- all as a matter of right
and justice. The efforts on the part of the employers
to patronize the labourers are seen as fetters of slavery,
Albeit golden fetters instead of iron ones. I have not
referred to the iron fetters of personal abuse, kicking
and other brutal practices that still prevail on plantations
and in factories. The Madras Labour Union is trying
to put , stop to them by legal means. The new spirit is
in evidence among Indian labourers who will not tolerate
such brutalities anymore; but it is well to recognise that
even the above-named golden fetters are resented and
the Indian labourer feels that he is cot only a "hand,"
but also that he has a head and a heart, and aspires to
come into his own.

## NON-FACTORY LABOUR

While there is a semblance of factory legislation
--- _nam ke vaste_, for the sake of the name, as we say is
India --- labour outside the factory bas not even that
much of protection. Agricultural labour, on plantations
and other places, has its own untold woes. The conditions
in the mine settlements --- e.g Kolar goldfield
--- are not easily describable. Let me speak of the large
body of clerks in shops --- especially shops in the wholesale
Indian markets. There is no Shops Closing Act to
limit the duration of their working day; there is no
shop Inspector; the twelve-hour day of the factory
labourer does not apply to the shop-worker ; they are
"free to work" as long as they please, or, rather, as
long as their benevolent masters like ; they have no
Sunday as a weekly holiday. Besides, the occasional
festivals --- a few days in the year --- only once
month on each new moon day, the bazaars are closed.
The Indian bazaar does not recognise the value or
necessity of a weekly day of rest. The bazaar opens
early in the morning and does not close till very late
at night. The European shops and Indian shops
managed on European lines have fixed hours of work
and Sunday as holiday, but Indian markets, with their
thousands upon thousands of employees, have excessive
hours without the weekly rest on Sundays. The wages of
these shop employees are scandalously low and their prospects
poor. The average map begins at £1 per month,
and unless he proves to be exceptionally able he jas no
hopes of rising above 24 per month, or so, at the end of
his career. He only lives on in the hope of a partnership
or of setting up an independent business some day.

Lest it be understood that the capitalistic public is.
the only culprit in this matter, let it be made clear that
Government sets them a good example. The Government
is as much an exploiter of non-factory labour as
any merchant-prince or capitalistic concern. Take
Post Office wages and see the rise the Government has
worked in that department in the course of nearly half
a century:

_1875 --- Wages ran between 5s. 6d. to 9s. 6d. per
month._

_1915 --- Wages ran between 8s. 6d. to 10s. 3d. per
month._

I have purposely taken the Postal Department because
of an incident to which I wish to draw the very pertinent
attention of the Labourites and Trade Unionists
everywhere. Here it is:---

There was recently a postal strike in Calcutta, and
the grievances of the postmen, as is generally the case
with labour troubles, related to the question of improvement
in their pay. The matter, however, went to the
Police-Court, and six of the "ringleaders" in the strike
were sentenced to three weeks rigorous imprisonment each,
Bod eight others to a fine of Rs. 20 each, or in default, to
ten days' rigorous imprisonment. Dealing with this particular
matter a "Disgusted Briton" writes to the _Statesman_
of Calcutta.

>All of these men were striking ab a method of protest against
that "graded salary of Rs. 15 rising to Rs. 25" (£1 to 2.1, 138, 4d.
per month), which they hold to be insufficient to maintain themselves
and their families, and which is below the rates paid to men
in similar positions in Bombay. If the law obtaining in India
permits the infliction of sentences of imprisonment for such 80.
called "offences" of these, Barely it is about time the law was
altered. If the sentences were permissible under the Defence of
India Act (equivalent to D.O.R.A.), they would seem a gross
misuse of power. It is easy, oo Rs. 1000 (£.66 136. 4d.) a month
or over, to damn these poor men for causing as inconvenience ; it
is shameful to misuse our powers to imprison them. The rise in
the cost of living in Calcutta is known to all and when these men
follow the countless precedents of the United Kingdom to endeavour
to better their condition we give them an answer that not
only smacks of disgruntled despotism, but da mog British justice,
whatever the law may be.

## CONCLUSION

The Government of India is an autocracy. The
Indian Reforms under discussion in Parliament plainly
indicate that the present machinery of autocracy will be
maintained. The ears of autocracy are always deal to
the groans of the sufferer. The voice of the poor factory
labourer will not even reach those ears, for it will be
drowned amid the droning of the machinery of the rich
capitalist, and the latter is the friend of the Government.
There is a serious attempt to establish a living brotherhood
of the labourers of the world, and the Indian labourers
fondly look to organised labour in the United Kingdom
to champion their cause. As their spokesman, on
their behalf, I am putting forward this condensed statement.
I appeal to those who hold the cause of Labour and
Trade Unionism sacred, to stretch their hands of fellowship
to their comrades in India. Remember the Cause of
Labour is one.

\ 

Dear Sir and Brother,

\ 

The working masses of the Dominion of India are
at last awakening from their slumber. The toilers are
organising so that they may be able to control their lives
even as their brethren in Great Britain have done. In
Madras the first Labour Unions have been formed, and
already much good has resulted because the workers
have commenced to learn the value of combination.

But we are young, and have much to learn, and we
desire help from our elder brothers in Great Britain.
We have therefore sent our President, Mr. B. P. Wadia,
over the seas to ask for your help and advice. We feel
that we shall not appeal to you in vain.

We have noticed that when your Annual Congress
meets there are fraternal delegates present from other
parts of the British Commonwealth. We know that
you welcome the representatives from Canada, and that
your heart goes out to your brothers in that Great
Dominion. We ask you to receive at your Congress
this year our Brother Wadia as the first fraternal
delegate from the toiling masses of the Dominion of
India. You have declared that you are working for a
great brotherhood of the working class without distinction
of creed or colour, and we feel sure therefore that
you will welcome our Brother Wadia and will receive
him as our fraternal delegate from the first Trade Union
in India.

Conveying to you the greetings of the masses of
Indian workmen, knowing now for the first time the
joys of co-operating together for the uplifting of the
working people and trusting to receive your great
assistance.

In the name of the Indian workmen, we salute you.

\
