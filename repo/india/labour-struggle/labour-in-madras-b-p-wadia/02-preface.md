# PREFACE

History in the making, however romantic,
does not strike its makers as either history or
romance. Like the gentleman who spoke prose
without knowing it, almost all makers of history
are unaware of the fact that they are such worthies.
In rare instances when Nature is moving
forward, as is sometimes her wont, in leaps, events
of yesterday stand glaringly revealed to-day already
as facts of history.

One such instance is provided by the Labour
Movement in Madras. When it was started in the
early part of 1918, no one dreamed of the effect it
would have on its environment generally; it was
hoped that besides bettering the lot of the poor
drudges and slaves of the economic system it might
slowly tend to the creation of class consciousness
among the Indian workers. In very unexpected
ways, in quarters the least suspected, the labour
work in Madras produced effects. Who could
have anticipated the aid it rendered to the cause of
Indian Home Rule in Great Britain, especially
with the British Labour Party in the summer of
1919? Very few could have dreamed of the
readiness and capacity of the Indian workers to
unite and organise, to educate themselves in the
matter of their owo rights and prerogatives and to
agitate for gaining them. Who among us, who
went to them, bad any inkling of the culture
inherent in the labourers, who had any idea of
their political instinct and practical sagacity?

The Movement, I believe, has come to stay.
It cannot be killed, nor can its swift growth be
checked for any length of time. A tiny seed sown
at Perambur has sprouted and the winds of the
world and national circumstances have swept some
of its early seeds to other places.

How well I remember the forenoon when two
men, unknown tome, whom I had never seen before,
came and told me something about the "suffering
labourers". They referred to the Buckingham and
Carnatic Mills, of which I had vaguely heard, but
of which I knew less than little. They referred to
a few minutes for food," "swallowing a few
morsels," "running lest they be shut out. Il
was at New India office, u here I was then working
under my beloved and respected Chief, Mrs. Besant.
She was not in office that day, and I was
loath to leave it in ber absence even for a couple
of hours. But my Theosophical spirit got the better
of my political duties. I immediately ordered
my car, took the two strangers, and went to Perambur
and watched outside the Mills where I saw the
poor labourers at their noon-day meal. It was
quick work. They came, they gobbled, they
returned.

That was how it began. On the following
Saturday we had a meeting, followed by another,
and yet another --- but the story will be found in
the book. I agreed to the publication of my speeches
and the narrative of the struggle --- a struggle
which is not over, nor is it likely to be for some
time yet. We have not included the history of
the work and progress of the first Trade Union in
India since my return from abroad in August 1920.
The wonderful unity and solidarity displayed by the
textile workers of this city, the resort to Passive
Resistance, the unjust lock-out of 5500 men from
the Buckingham Mills, the effort on the part of the
employers to break the Madras Labour Union as
it is constituted now, the lawsuit against myself
and nine other leaders for malicious conspiracy
and alienating the affection of the work
people, the order of injunction stopping our
mouths, and destroying our liberty of speech
and action --- all that is well known to the Indian
public. The strike is still on ; the lock-out is not
over on the 88th day as I write; the whole story
must be told elsewhere on some future occasion.

This volume gives the story of the early beginnings
of the Labour Movement in India and
some immediate resultant factors. In this preface,
however, I should like to indulge in the expression
of a few thoughts as to its future and as to the
methods of advance.

The educated classes in India have so far
failed to realise the great value of the Labour
Movement as a factor in the general political
advancement of the country. Without the masses
there can be no true Democracy. For that
reason, on the 1st June 1918, addressing an open
Letter to the Home Rulers, I said :

>"We want to bring the masses into line with
the educated classes. Much lecturing work has
been done already and what seems now necessary
is to combine them in all sorts of ways. Agricultural
Societies, Trade and Labour Unions, Ryot
Combines, Craft Guilds --- these should be started.
Let common interests in each taluq and village
combine to remedy the evils from which they are
suffering. The masses do possess political outlook
; they have lost the art of making themselves
heard, and our task should be to persuade them
into speech and action."

It is very necessary to recognize the Labour
Movement as an integral part of the National
Movement. The latter will not succeed in the
right direction of democracy if Indian working
classes are not enabled to organize their own forces
and come into their own. Unless this is done for
all classes of labourers --- peasants, plantation
coolies, factory "hands" and miners --- even the
Montagu Reforms will only succeed in transferring
the power of bureaucracy from foreign to native
hands; that is not Democracy.

There is an additional reason why in the
coming months, the educated classes should interest
themselves in Labour problems. Because of
the agitation carried on and the work done during
the last three years, here, ia Great Britain and at
Washington, labour legislation is bound to come
before our legislatures. The law-suit instituted by
Messrs. Binny & Co, against me and nine others,
will also force the pace of legislation for recognition
of Trade Unions. If the educated classes lose
the opportunity of evincing a genuine interest on
behalf of labour, it will confirm the doubt Indian
labour now entertains about the bona fides of
those classes and their demand for political emancipation.
Labour problems must be regarded as
part of the general National problems and the
interests of labour must be safeguarded against the
inroads by Capital, both Indian and foreign. If
at the very outset this is not done, we shall open
an era of class struggle between Labour and Capital;
and who wants that in India ?

To this end certain principles have to be
borne in mind. First, the Indian labourer's right
to citizenship must be fully recognized. Legislation
must cease to regard him as a "hand", in letter and
spirit. Citizenship implies a condition of freedom
and the labourers are not far removed from a state
of slavery. Wage-slavery is only one remove from
chattel slavery and has inherent in it aspects which
are worse than those of chattel slavery. Citizenship
in a civilized state carries with it a decency of
life, a contentment of heart, and a cultivation of
intellect. These our labourers do not evince to-day
in their wretched existences. Their scandalous
wages, their semi-nakedness, their ghastly hovels,
their awful surroundings are of a nature of which
any State ought to be thoroughly ashamed.

In the coming legislation, therefore, the fact
to be remembered is that labourers are the prime
consideration. In creating machinery we must
bear in mind that it is put together to relieve the
tension of the labourer's life, and not to facilitate
the hoarding of profits at the expense of human
suffering. Let it aot crush men, women and young
persons in the name of growing industries of the
country. The legislation must not be undertaken
from the employer's point of view ; nor must we
be swayed by the dubious talk of growing industries.
What good is it to a State to gain wealth
out of misery and lose the soul of happiness which
a contented citizenship yields ? Are we going to
be benefited by the lesson afforded by the utter
failure of the economic and industrial system of
the age which is now fast closing ? Let me repeat,
therefore, to our educated legislators: Do not
mistake men for machines and remember you are
legislating for human beings.

Next in the solution of general problems
--- and they are many and varied --- it is absolutely
necessary to recognise the fact that the old system
has broken down. In most advanced countries it
is evident that the solution of labour problems by
old and time-worn methods is unfruitful. It is
no more a question of increase of wages and
decrease of hours; it is no more a question of the
utility of the weapon of strikes and lock-outs. It
is a new orientation --- the abolition of every
vestige of slavery, of any kind whatever, from the
body politic of the system as a whole, which
tarnishes the life of labour ; the introduction of
proper and adequate safe-guards for the control of
production and of produce, economically and
organically; the full but also the only legitimate
recognition of Capital by a deprivation of its
power to exploit Labour and to accumulate profits;
the full measure of the privileges and responsibilities
of citizenship to be secured for labouring
classes as for others ; the recognition of the factor
of growing importance in reference to the internationalism
of Labour.

These are some of the points to be studied by
our publicists. Let us not deceive ourselves with
exploded theories of profit-sharing and the like;
let our legislators endeavour to lose their Indian
provincialism and look abroad at what is happening
--- in Italy with the metal-workers, in Great
Britain with the builders in their new guild, in
Georgia with its new socialist state, in Russia as
described by Mr, H. N. Brailsford. in the midst
of crashing systems is slowly but surely emerging
a new order of things economic, in which Labour
will wield a new power, and its method of collective
bargaining will not be by the old use of the
strike-weapon. Hear the Labourer chant his
_mantram_ the world over: he sings it as his ploughshare
turns the sol, he sings it as the clatter of
machinery makes him deaf, he sings it in the dark
dungeon of the mine, he sings it as he earns his
starvation wages, he sings it at home and abroad:---

>We are the hewers and delvers who toü for another's gain,
--- The common colds and the rabble, stunted of brow and brain.
What do we want, the gleaners, of the harvest we have reaped ?
What do we want, the neuters, of the honey wa have heaped ?.
We want the drones to be driven away from our golden hoard ;
We want to share in the harvest; we want to sit at the board ;
We want what sword or suffrage has never yat won for man,
--- fruits of his toil God promised when the curse of toil began.

--- B. P. W.
