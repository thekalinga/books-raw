## Introduction

The first one-and-half decades of my life as a researcher were mainly
spent on studies exploring the condition of labour in the lower echelons
of the rural and urban economy of Gujarat, India. In June 1976, having
been nominated to the chair of comparative sociology at the Erasmus
University in Rotterdam, I delivered my inaugural address on what from
the early 1970s onwards had become known as the informal or unorganized
sector of the economy.[^/3/1] During the years that followed I continued
my fieldwork-based investigations on this vulnerable workforce, which
showed few signs of upward mobility and was equally unsuccessful in
acquiring much better terms of employment. Despite the promises with
which political parties of all colours tried to secure or increase their vote
banks, little progress was made towards the formalization of work
arrangements and labour rights. In fact, the reverse trend of informalization
seemed to gain in prominence for the remaining years of the twentieth
century. The forced exit of large numbers of workers from the composite
textile mills in Ahmedabad struck me as a dramatic instance of the
turning tide between capital and labour. Massive retrenchment in this
branch of large-scale industry had already started in the late 1970s, and
went on unabated for the next two and a half decades. Altogether,
around 125,000 workers lost their mill jobs and most were forced to
survive in the informal sector of the city's economy. How they have slid
down in the labour hierarchy and what happened to their households
during that process was the theme of my valedictory address in June
2001, marking my resignation from the University of Amsterdam.[^/3/2]
Once labelled as the vanguard of the working class in the industrial
society to come, the victims of the informalization policy have joined the
ranks of the fragmented and unorganized proletariat. They now belong
to an underclass, many times more numerous in size, which has always
lacked the bargaining strength required to increase the extremely low
price paid for their labour power.

serialized essay was subsequently reprinted as the opening chapter of _Wage Hunters and
Gatherers; Search for Work in the Urban and Rural Economy of South Gujarat_ (Oxford
University Press, Delhi 1994).


The research with which I documented their expulsion from formal
sector employment took place between 1998 and 2001. During the first
phase, I collaborated closely with Prof. B.B. Patel, one of the first to find
out what had happened to the labourers who lost their jobs in the first
round of mill closures.[^/3/3] As a leading staff member of the Gandhi Labour
Institute, Prof. Patel became involved in the rehabilitation scheme introduced
by the government of Gujarat for the benefit of the dismissed
workforce. The ex-mill labourers were invited to join courses set up to
train them in the basic skills of various crafts. Their applications, with
data on their identity and employment record, were filed and kept at the
GLI. In 1998, we made use of this stock of information on ex-mill
workers to conduct a survey among 600 households. In our sample ---
selected by type of mill job, year of dismissal and age at that moment,
social identity and place of residence --- we tried to cover the main
features of the former mill workforce. Following the first phase of
quantitative investigations, I started doing fieldwork, for a period of six
months spread over 1999 and 2000, in order to come into closer contact
with the day-to-day life and work experience of my informants and their
families.

My fieldwork schedule revolved around issues highlighting the fall in
living standards which were the immediate result of mill closure. To
begin with, incomes dropped to less than half of the wages earned before.
To overcome this setback other household members were forced to
engage in gainful employment. Labour rights fought for by past generations
of mill workers disappeared overnight and terms of employment,
_e.g._ regulating modes of hiring and firing or payment stipulations, are no
longer protected by legal codes binding employers to fair practices. The
victims have also forfeited the social security provisions, such as health
insurance and provident fund allowance, which were part and parcel of
their labour contract. The loss of such secondary benefits has further
aggravated their vulnerability. Last but not least, as members of a
powerful trade union, the workers in the textile industry had a proud
record in promoting and protecting their class-based interests. They now
lack the kind of collective strength which helped them to restrain the
uncontrolled operations of free enterprise. My fieldwork not only focused
on documenting the deterioration in material conditions and the
reduction of skill levels but also aimed to find out how the progressive
loss of regular mill jobs has affected the social consciousness of people
who used to be identified as standing in the forefront of working class
politics.

The closure of more than fifty mills is certainly not unique to
Ahmedabad. The crisis in the large-scale textile industry is a nation-wide
phenomenon. Apart from the drastic impact on the metropolitan economies
of Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai, it has also severely hit smaller
cities such as Kanpur and Coimbatore. The case study presented in this
book can be backed up by similar reports on the collapse of this branch
of industry elsewhere in the country. My monograph is one of the few
publications which, rather than dealing with the how and why of the cut
in mill production and the immediate shock of job loss, zooms in on the
subsequent fate of the sacked workforce.[^/3/4] The literature on de-industrialization
is rapidly growing, reflective of a trend that is gaining in
prominence and not only in India or Asia at large. A fairly large number
of studies deal with the ongoing restructuring of industrial production in
Atlantic societies.[^/3/5] What needs to be analysed, however, are the major
variations in form and substance within this larger pattern. In the first
place, a clear watershed can be observed between advanced industrial
societies in which a strong trade union movement has been able to resist
the victimization of its members and less industrialized societies in which
collective action has remained much more weakly organized and institutionalized.
There is a similar distinction regarding the successful introduction,
or lack, of care arrangements attributed to the welfare state.
Where such social provisions remained absent or were poorly effected in
a clear breach of trust, as in the case of the workers driven out of the
Ahmedabad mills, these schemes --- linked to formal sector employment-lacked,
in the crucial hour of need, the legal and political
standing which were preconditions for their just implementation.

[^/3/4]: D. D'Monte is the author of a well-documented study on the demise of the cotton
mills in Mumbai in the aftermath of the prolonged strike at the beginning of the 1980s:
_Ripping the Fabric; Mumbai's Decline in a Global World_ (Oxford University Press, New
Delhi 2002). M. Menon and N. Adharkar have jointly written a fascinating, as far as I
know still unpublished manuscript, entitled: _A Hundred Years, A Hundred Voices_. It is
based on interviews with (former) mill workers and members of their families. C. Joshi has
very recently published her history of the industrial workforce in Kanpur: _Lost Worlds;
Indian Labour and Its Forgotten Histories_ (Permanent Black, Delhi 2003). In the final
chapter she describes the misfortune of these workers when their mills closed down from
the early 1980s onwards.



As I have already pointed out, the largest segment of the dismissed
labour force made redundant in the formal sector instantly slid down to
the bottom of the city's economy. To do what? Here I would like to note
my strong reservations on the use of the term de-industrialization. No
doubt, the closing down of most of the big textile enterprises was
accompanied by an overall shift in the composition of the urban economy.
Many ex-mill workers drifted to other sectors of activity and became
casually engaged in transport, petty trade, construction, and a wide
range of services in particular. But a sizeable contingent remained firmly
employed in industry. Not in large-scale and high-tech establishments
but scattered over small workshops or as homeworkers, either on their
own account or as casual wage earners. This is why I prefer the label of
informalization to define the nature of industrial relations in which they
are involved. I have discussed the arrival of these newcomers in the lower
economic echelons of Ahmedabad, where they have joined the multitude
of men, women, and children already in fierce competition with each
other for work and income way below the poverty line. My fieldwork
findings contradict the cherished myth of the infinite absorption capacity
of the informal sector, which implies that there is always room for
new entrants to make a living. That happy tale is more inspired by
wishful thinking than by close monitoring of the misery to be found in
the habitat of the labouring poor. I have elaborated on dimensions of
deprivation which are often understated or even totally neglected in
studies based on statistics and other quantitative data, suggesting that the
people living in poverty are much better off than they themselves seem to
realize. My argument along these lines was the theme of the Sukhamoy
Chakravarty Memorial Lecture delivered in late 2001.[^/3/6] I have expanded
on the same question in the last two chapters of this book.

social, cultural and political aspects', edited by B. Altena and M. van der
Linden, published as Supplement 10 in _International Review of Social History_, vol. 47, 2002.


Having written up the results of my empirical research in
Ahmedabad --- the chapters included in Part II --- I decided to lengthen
the time span of my study with an analysis on the rise of the textile
industry in the city and the growth of its workforce. The early beginnings
in the second half of the nineteenth century were, for my purpose, less
important than the rapid expansion of the composite cotton mills during
the first half of the twentieth century. Based on the wide variety of
secondary sources available I have dealt in the first four chapters ---
reproduced in Part I --- with the history of mill work, the origin and social
identity of the labourers recruited for this new branch of industry, the
joint action taken to increase their bargaining strength, the growing
social and political assertion made manifest in the rise of a powerful trade
union movement, the introduction of labour legislation protecting their
terms of employment, and the gradual improvement in the standard of
living in which all members of their households shared. This is the way
I have framed my study on the making and the unmaking of an
industrial working class. The underlying idea was to demarcate the stark
contrast between then and now. The mill workers had a regular job and
time-rated payment, a contract stipulating wage levels, hours of work
and other clauses, the benefits of social care arrangements and the
precious claim, fought for in the early decades of the twentieth century,
on the representation of collective interests. This combined package of
labour rights guaranteed a life of security, stability, and dignity. All that
came unstuck with the loss of their jobs and the concomitant exodus to
the informal sector of the economy,[^/3/7] resulting in a major life crisis.

_Economic and Political Weekly_, vol. 36/52, 2001: 4804--21.

[^/3/7]: I prefer to use the concept of informal sector work, as I have done in earlier
publications, because the meaning of the term unorganized is, in my opinion, even more
problematic. The owners of industrial or other small-scale establishments may be difficult
to trace in official statistics and in the tax books of the government. But they are actually
well-organized in their dealings with suppliers or customers and their business practices in
general, legal or not, by no means lack organizational skill.

There is, however, another motive for presenting a detailed account
on the world forever lost, as the victims have come to realize in retrospect.
Early in 2002, as I barely finished collecting the data needed to
write this book, Ahmedabad was swept by communal riots. The city had
witnessed communal riots before but this new round was more vicious,
than similar explosions of violence in the preceding decades mainly due
to the manner in which the state machinery reacted. A veritable flood of
reports and documents has been produced which relate the outbreak of
communal riots to an upsurge of religious or cultural politics. The
violence, according to the gist of this literature, was organized and
orchestrated by a broad platform of associations sharing the same mindset
and strongly biased against the religious minority. Without questioning
the validity of this thesis, my opinion is that the political machinations
at work should be assessed in the context of the changed social fabric of
the city. Pushing a huge workforce out of mill employment and denying
them the rights which used to dignify their work and life, has caused not
only material impoverishment but has also led to the exclusion of these
people from real and proper participation in mainstream society. In my
analysis the boundaries along which social identities are drawn, based on
caste and religion, have contributed to the strengthening of primordial
loyalties. These bonds now constitute the meagre social capital for the
masses fighting with each other to occupy the scarce space available in
the lower echelons of the urban economy and society. Right from the
start of the social and political mobilization of mill workers, as I have
argued in Part I, their separate identities were both acknowledged and
manipulated. These fault lines, however, could be moderated and even
overcome in their cross-border interaction in the workplace and in the
neighbourhood. Such moments and features of being part of the same
collectivity faded away when they became uprooted from their formal
sector livelihood. In the desperate search for work --- which is casual in
nature, lowly skilled, and badly paid --- they have learnt to stick to their
own segregated niches and easily fall prey to propaganda that says they
have nothing in common with those who happened to be their workmates
and neighbours.



As part of its liberalization and privatization policy, the government
of India appears firm in its decision to drastically curtail the rights of
formal sector workers. On the other hand, there is a growing awareness
in policy circles that something needs to be done to raise the welfare of
the vast army of men, women, and children exposed to a work regime
which comes close to the definition of predatory capitalism. The report
of the National Commission of Labour (2002) concedes that these people
are exploited by those who make use of their labour power on a casual,
regular, or continuous basis. To overcome the vulnerability in which the
masses of unorganized and unprotected workers are made to live, the
official document recommends the introduction of a social safety net
and the establishment of a special Employment and Welfare Board. I
confess to be quite sceptical about the political will and administrative
capacity to put these schemes in practice. After all, the rules and
regulations introduced earlier to safeguard the interests of informal
sector workers --- _e.g._ minimum wage legislation, abolition of contract
labour, or procedures for hiring and firing --- has largely remained inoperative
and ineffective. This is hardly surprising in a political climate
which allowed labour laws protecting even formal sector employment to
be flouted, as the mill workers of Ahmedabad found out when they lost
their jobs. Without a build up of pressure from below aiming to redress
the strongly tilted balance in favour of capital and against labour interests,
the dream for a better future for the working class-at-large will
remain unfulfilled.

On a final note, I would like to draw the reader's attention to the
photobook _Working in the Mill No More_, a companion to this monograph
published simultaneously by Oxford University Press and
Amsterdam University Press (New Delhi/Amsterdam 2003). In this
joint production with Parthiv Shah, photographer and designer, we have
portrayed what it meant to be a mill worker in 'the good old days', what
happened to them when they lost their jobs, and the impact of this crisis
on their households and neighbourhoods.
