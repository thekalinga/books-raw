## Acknowledgements

It is my duty, as they say in Gujarat, to thank a large number of people
whom I met in the course of my investigations or, at a later stage, while
I was processing the data and started writing this book. I am grateful to
many friends and colleagues who gave valuable advice or provided badly
required information in different phases of this project. Prof. B.B. Patel
paved my way to the industrial localities of Ahmedabad and to the
extensive records on the ex-mill workers at the Gandhi Labour Institute.
We teamed up for the survey which formed the basis for the profiles on
the changed trajectories of the labouring lives described in chapter 6.
Kiran Nanavati was in charge of this operation, during which one or
more members of 600 households were interviewed, at least once and
sometimes repeatedly. Kiran became my constant companion during the
six months of exhaustive but rewarding fieldwork which followed.
Stepping into the shoes of his father Praful, who died much too young,
Manan Trivedi spared no effort to make my stay comfortable and fruitful
whenever I came to bother him. In Barry and Darshan, I found excellent
hosts who saw to my wellbeing in good and bad times. I owe a major
debt to local-level activists, among them Hausala Prasad Mishra,
Rameshchandra Parmar, Valjibhai Patel and Jivan Thakore, who opened
doors in quarters which I would not have found on my own. The same
goes for all those involved in trying to build up the framework of a civic
society which cuts across more parochial social formations, such as
Indukumar Jani, Martin Macwan, Achyut Yagnik and Girish Patel,
whom I have known for many years and who encouraged me to elaborate
on what I had already done. I am indebted to Sujata Patel for putting at
my disposal her unpublished writings on the textile industry of the city
in the past and present. Howard Spodek gave me the manuscript on the
social history of the city's elite that he was working on when we
happened to meet during his sabbatical year which he spent in
Ahmedabad. I am much obliged to the leaders and staff still present at
the office of the _Majoor Mahajan Sangh_, the mill workers' union, which
has known better days. The Secretary-General Manwar Shukla did not
shy away from answering with forbearance my sometimes impertinent
questions. And then there is SEWA, the Self-Employed Women's Association,
which has given a voice to women who used to toil and suffer in
silence. Ela Bhatt, Renana Jhabvala, and other members of the office and
field staff, constantly busy as they were, always made me feel welcome
and never refused to discuss matters which were their or my own
concern. In his capacity as Labour Commissioner, Sanjay Prasad allowed
me to make use of official statistics and reports which were relevant for
my investigations.

The empirical research reported upon in this study was funded by the
Indo-Dutch Programme on Alternatives in Development. The Dutch
IDPAD coordinator Marc Verhagen is one of those rare administrators
who try not to increase my workload by asking for more progress reports
and budget details than I feel able to produce. As a member of the
Amsterdam School of Social Science Research I would like to place on
record the support which I have unfailingly received from Jose Komen
and Teun Bijvoet. Andy Brown has been a careful and congenial editor or
translator of my writings in recent years. The publication of an English
version of this book has been made possible by a grant from NOW, the
Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research. Thanking all these
individuals and institutions once again, I would like to dedicate this
book to the ex-mill workers of Ahmedabad.
