## A Dramatic Turn for the Worse

### The Search for Work

For the former mill workers, the initial refusal to accept that their
companies had closed for good was replaced by a realization that there
was no other option than to look for work elsewhere. As could be
expected, some of them adapted to this dramatic change in their living
conditions relatively quickly while others were slower --- sometimes taking
several months to orient themselves to a different way of making a
living. The main factors determining response were age and level of
education or training. The older workers found it more difficult to say
farewell to life in the mill. Technical and administrative staff had skills
and experience that made them suitable for similar work elsewhere.
Many apparently succeeded in finding new jobs, but much of this
information was based on hearsay. The more qualified workers do not
normally live in the textile districts and were therefore not included in
our survey. Our 600 respondents largely came from the mass of lowskilled
workers who worked in the spinning and weaving shops or the
other production departments, or as maintenance staff. Our concern
here is what happened to this majority, accounting for around four fifths
of the workforce in the textile industry, after they were made redundant.

In the period of unemployment following redundancy, a small number
of former mill workers must have left the city, but these too fall
outside the scope of our survey. Wherever they have gone, it seems
plausible to assume that most of them also have slid down into the
informal sector of the economy. As already mentioned, however, most of
the outsiders' from other states such as Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh,
Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh stayed put in Ahmedabad. Their
motives for not leaving the city were the lack of employment opportunities
in their home states and a reluctance to uproot their families,
especially their children. The search for new employment was driven by
the need to provide for their families, and this period of transition was
marked by great financial insecurity. There was no time and little
financial breathing space to recover from the loss of their jobs at the
cotton mills. They kept their heads above water by borrowing money
from relatives or moneylenders or by asking for credit from shopkeepers.
They did this in the belief that, if the mill did not reopen, at least they
could look forward to payment of their savings and other money owed to
them by their former employers, including their redundancy pay. Consequently,
those among them who finally did receive their money,
considerably less than what they were entitled to, had to use it to pay off
the loans and other debts they had run up to survive the period of
unemployment.

A survey of workers who lost their jobs in March 1994 revealed that
30% were still without work 15 months later (Noronha and
Sharma 1999:1457). The study conducted by Masihi in 1990--91 in a
number of textile districts also showed that a quarter of 563 workers who
had been made redundant between 1984 and 1988 said that they no
(longer) had a job (Masihi 1993: 58). These long-term unemployed had
the same characteristics as the 161 respondents from our survey (27% of the total of 600) who considered themselves no longer economically
active. A little over half gave their age (over 50) as the main reason
for not going back to work, while a fifth put it down to failing health.
The remaining 27% said they were willing to work but were
unable to find a job. In my view, it would be a mistake to take this
difference in motivation too literally. Age and ill health may be valid
arguments to stop working, but few people stuck at the bottom of the
economy can afford this luxury. It is only possible if other members of
the household are willing and able to compensate for the loss in income.
In nearly all cases, this proved to have been the case, and was the reason
why those who claimed to be still seeking work in vain could continue to
do so. Unemployment is therefore a flexible concept, determined by
what is considered suitable work at any given moment. The ultimate
choice, and whether this in turn is eventually revised, depends on the
balance between the availability of work --- conditioned by factors such as
the nature of the work and how heavy it is, respectability and the degree
of continuity, the pay and the other terms of employment --- and the
extent to which the obligation to acquire income for the household can
be delegated to other members.

The starting point in the search for other work was always the same:
the desire to find a job that as far as possible offered what the mill
provided (see Noronha 1999: 102). The absence or inaccessibility of
work of this nature explains why in most cases it took so long for former
mill workers to find a new occupation. The period of idleness was
necessary to allow them to adjust their aspirations to a lower level. As
mentioned above, this adjustment was more difficult for some than for
others, while a significant group refused to take a step back at all.

How successful were the other 439 (600--161) respondents in their
search for new employment? 114 (19%) managed to find jobs in
their own line of work. These were mostly _Patels_ who were taken on
elsewhere as weavers. They now work in small powerloom units where, as
we shall see, their working conditions are much worse than they were in
the mills. Consequently, they tend to change jobs frequently. Most of
them got their first job after redundancy through other caste members
who do the same kind of work, but having entered this small-scale
industrial sector they manage to find their own way. In the same way
_Dalits_, members of the scheduled castes, who worked together in the
mills and live in the same neighbourhoods, have helped each other to
find work. This, however, is mostly outside the textile industry because
there is almost no demand for the kind of work they performed in the
spinning shops. A handful earn part of their living spinning by hand at
home on the _ambar charkha_. They earn so little at this, that it is purely
a secondary source of income. The continuing discriminatory practices
exclude _Dalits_ from a wide range of professions. Although they receive
preferential treatment in the public sector, private business employers
from higher castes seem to avoid employing _Dalits_, not least because of
their resentment against the government policy of positive discrimination.
Yet only a few of our respondents had managed to find a lowranking
public sector job, for instance as a peon or watchman, after
being sacked from the mill. Masihi, whose study was conducted in textile
districts with high concentrations of lower castes, summarized their
disadvantaged position in the competition for 'open' jobs as follows:

>It was found that many of them were handicapped in taking up different types of
jobs because of the stigma of untouchability attached to them. For instance,
some of them said that they cannot start a tea-stall or a vegetable stall or a stall
selling any eatables because the caste Hindus will not patronise it. If they want to
start any such stall, they have to go to unknown places. But for starting a smallsized
stall, they cannot go to long distance. Even if they go to places where
nobody knows them and carry out their work incognito sometimes someone
may recognise them and then it would be difficult to save their skin. This is the
reality in an urban-industrial city called Ahmedabad. We came across one 50
year old worker of _Chamar_ caste. He had passed S.S.C. examination (earlier it
was called matric). He knew a bit of English also. But he was sitting at a roadside,
repairing old shoes and chappals, because that was the traditional occupation of
his caste. His attempt to seek a job in private industries did not succeed and he
was forced to do such manual job. (Masihi 1993: 113)

A second category of workers suffering such handicaps in the search for
work are those who were not born and bred in Ahmedabad, or at least in
Gujarat. Even after having lived in the city for many years, their social
and work contacts tend to be limited to their own milieu. The tendency
to keep these 'outsiders' at arm's length is reinforced by their poor
command of Gujarati. The restricted social circles in which ex-mill
workers from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh
operate means that they lack the necessary social capital to allow them to
move into other sectors (see Patel 1988: 24).

Members of the Muslim minority also find their mobility in the
labour market limited by their social identity. Although other Muslims
help them find work in certain professions, Hindu employers and clients
often refuse to make use of their services. Masihi has the following to say
on this communal discrimination:

>We found many Muslim youths, rendered jobless due to closure of mills,
working in a team, stitching garments, engaged in embroidery and various such
home-based industries. One elderly Muslim observed that from his point of view
closure of mills has benefited his community. He said, 'Now our boys work at
home and so, they don't spend after tea or snacks and get their meals at home.
Moreover they are protected from other harmful influences from outside.' While
it is easier for a Muslim worker to get help from his co-religionists, it is equally
difficult for him to get a job outside his community. Not that all doors are closed
for them. There are many skilled jobs like repairing cycles, cars, stoves, umbrella,
etc. which are in the hands of Muslims and Muslim workers get jobs there. But
in case of new factories which are coming up, it is difficult for Muslim workers
to get jobs. (Masihi 1993: 114--5)

This summary shows that the social identities which determined the
division of tasks in the mills have also proved the most important
channel for finding other work. Caste membership or religious conviction
are the common denominator in efforts to help others find new
employment opportunities. Coincidence has also played its part, of
course, but in the choice of what to do or not do, where to look and not
to look, it is the workers' background that has often been decisive.

### Conditions of New Employment

The former mill workers would prefer to find work with a permanent
contract, but the security and protection provided by such a status ended
when they were made redundant. The closest they come to that now is an
unwritten contract in which employer and employee agree to continue
the relationship until the contract is terminated. This is the basis on
which workers are taken on by factories or workshops as wage labourers
for a non-stipulated period, or as guards by companies that specialize in
security for industrial premises or private homes. 158 of the 600 respondents,
a little more than a quarter, work on this basis. As long as the work
they do fulfils the requirements of the employer, they can be sure of a job.
But they can derive no rights from this employment. Casual labourers,
who are taken on daily or until a job is done, are in an even more
vulnerable position. 44 respondents were engaged in this form of employment,
which is especially common in the building sector. These
labourers assemble early in the morning at one of the many labour
markets (_nakas_) --- it may be a road junction, a square, or a bus station ---
where they wait for the jobbers and (sub)contractors to come and recruit
the labour they need. Sometimes, a relative, neighbour, or friend might
have asked them to tag along as an extra hand or told them to report
directly to the building site. This meeting of supply and demand is not
based on any form of standard terms of employment and the oral
agreement is very vague and fluid.

More numerous than these regular and casual wage labourers, who
accounted for a third of all respondents (202 of 600), are those who are
self-employed, working on their own account. Three of the most common
occupations in this contingent are rickshaw drivers, street vendors,
(of cloth and garments, food and drinks, crockery, vegetables, etc.) and
repairmen. These three groups alone accounted for 90 respondents, but
this by no means covers all of those who earn a living through some form
of self-employment. I estimate that three-quarters of those in the 'Other'
category (147) also belong in this group, which brings the subtotal to
around 200. The reason they were not immediately categorized as
working at their own cost is because they did not give a clear answer to
the question about the nature of their current occupation. Around a
third of this group do some kind of work at home (making garments,
paper, toys, or plastic articles, etc.) on a contract basis. They tend,
however, to see an occupation as something you do outside the home and
get paid a wage for, and which requires a certain level of skill. Although
they are without doubt economically active, they find it difficult to say
what their main occupation is. A second group of a similar size consists
of workers who are engaged in more than one trade at the same time.
Maximum participation in the labour process is the only way they can
earn enough to keep their heads above water, but makes it hard for them
to say what their main source of income is. The best way to describe the
remaining group is perhaps occasional workers. They work on some days
and not on others, depending on the demand for their services. They are
not overly active in seeking work but do not refuse it if it is offered to
them. With three quarters of this group included among the selfemployed
and the final quarter among the casual labourers, we see that
regular or casual wage labourers constitute the largest group (202+37=239) among the former mill workers. Rearranged in a slightly less complex
format, the categories break down as follows:

* no longer active or long-term unemployed: 27%
* regular or casual wage labour: 40%
* self-employed: 33%

The distribution largely correlate with other empirical studies on the
employment status of the former mill workers in Ahmedabad (Patel and
Cowlagi 1997:13; Patel 1997:27). In table form this produces the
following figure:

#### EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF FORMER MILL WORKERS

It would, however, be incorrect to interpret these figures as more than
approximations and, for example, to extrapolate a trend over the years:
from less to greater unemployment, from wage labour to self-employment,
or vice versa. Apart from the fact that the classification criteria in
the various surveys do not run exactly parallel, it is not always clear from
respondents' answers which category they belong to. The concept of
wage labour, for example, can be interpreted in different ways. Are the
members of work gangs which the jobbers put together as long they are
needed day-labourers or, since their earnings are divided amongst them
at the end of the day, should they be seen as essentially self-employed?
Both options are arguably correct and the weight given to them seems to
depend on the specific nature of the industrial landscape in which the
workers operate. As micro-entrepreneurs, home-workers take on work
on a contract basis, but they could be seen as having something approaching
an employer-employee relationship with the other members
of the household engaged in the home-based production process. Equally
debatable on closer examination is the distinction between regular and
casual wage labour. Although regular labourers are expected to report for
work every day, they can derive no rights from this automatic extension
of their 'contract'. Sudden and immediate dismissal is not at all exceptional.
The fact that it is always a possibility means that their actual status
is little different from that of daily wage labourers. Lastly, when questioned
further than can be done within the framework of a basic survey,
by no means all of those who had qualified themselves as long-term
unemployed had indeed worked 'not at all or only very occasionally'.
Conversely, some 'casual labourers' work so irregularly that they are as
good as long-term unemployed. If we accept the rather arbitrary choices
made by the respondents themselves in their 'evasive' responses to
pertinent questions, we can assume that the data gathered during the
survey adequately reflects the scale and nature of employment and
unemployment. Classifying our 600 respondents in a number of main
categories gives a reasonable indication of the fate of the workers who
have been made redundant by the cotton mills in Ahmedabad in the last
two decades of the twentieth century. What outsiders may regard as
lacking in transparency, ambiguous, and open to different interpretations
is actually a reflection of the disparate and variable nature in terms
of time and space, of the informal sector of the economy.

### De-Skilling, Working Hours and Income

Instead of trying to draw sharp dividing lines between the various
categories in the lower echelons of the working population, the emphasis
should be placed more on the contrast in the organization of work and
the modality of employment with that in the formal sector. As I pointed
out in an earlier study on this subject, even the dichotomy between
formal and informal sector is sometimes difficult to demarcate clearly
(see Breman 1976). But the redundant cotton mill workers have a more
acute awareness of what this transition from formal to informal implies
than most outsiders. Seen through their eyes, it is understandable that
they see the change in their employment modality as an unequivocal
decline in their living standards.

#### Skill Level

The ex-mill workers are now employed in jobs that typically require a far
lower level of capital investment than the work they performed in the
mills. If mechanized power is involved at all it is in the form of simple
machines (a rickshaw motor, a sewing machine or other simple equipment)
for repairing clocks and watches, radios, bicycles or household
articles or craft tools for producing handmade commodities (leather
goods, furniture, _ambar charkha_, paintbrushes, etc.). Only the weavers
in the powerloom sheds work on the same machines that they used in the
mills and which have been sold to the owners as scrap. The skill level
outside the industrial sector of the economy is much lower, and it is
especially in these branches --- small-scale trade, transport and services ---
that a large proportion of the former mill workers have ended up. Many
of them have lost the skills that they learned in the mills (Noronha and
Sharma 1999: 1456). On the other hand, the work now demands much
greater dexterity and physical effort. Complaints from construction
labourers, pedal rickshaw drivers, cart pullers, head porters and ambulant
street vendors about being exhausted must partly be seen in light of
the fact that they now work far less with machines. A number of
informants who took a low-paid job as a security guard after being
dismissed from the mill told us how their bodies had been attuned to the
motions of the machines they operated. They were now too old to adopt
a different working position and heavy manual labour was completely
out of the question (_see also_ Masihi 1993: 72). The loss of skill goes
together with the awareness of being detached from more complex forms
of work that used to be split up into a large number of tasks which
succeeded each other in a fixed and time-bound rhythm.

#### Working Hours

The work in the mills had a daily rhythm of eight hours, leaving enough
time to spend with the family, perform tasks in the household, and
engage in activities outside the home. This is now completely impossible.
On paper, the powerloom establishments work according to a three-shift
system, but in fact, as everyone knows, the working hours are split up
into a day shift and a night shift, each lasting ten to twelve hours. The
employers will not take anyone on for less. More is of course always
possible. If someone does not turn up for work, a member of the
previous shift can simply work another ten or more hours. Homeworkers
can decide for themselves how many hours they work, but the
pressure to earn more by starting early in the morning and working until
late in the evening is great. Often all the members of the household play
some part in the production, leaving very little leisure time for them to
spend together. Others who work in the open air at their own expense
can determine the length of their own working day. Street vendors offer
their wares long after night has fallen and have to be up and ready to
replenish their stocks at the break of day. Lastly there is the not inconsiderable
number who have to spend part of the day or night doing a second
job to supplement their low income. The former mill workers have to
cope not only with much longer, but also much more irregular, working
hours. Although they used to work in three eight-hour shifts, the shift
roster was drawn up in advance and they were paid extra for overtime.
Such bonuses are a thing of the past and the regular cycle of their
working lives has been replaced by erratic and unpredictable interruptions
and long periods of idleness during which they are not paid. The
fact that they show up for work is no guarantee that they will actually be
employed on any particular day. It is often uncertain whether the
working day will begin at all and how it will develop, while the workers
are expected to adapt themselves to these large and often unpredictable
fluctuations. Free days and leave have become a luxury and are never
paid.

#### Income

More than any other criterion the enormous drop in income illustrates
the degree to which the quality of life of the former mill workers has
deteriorated. The weavers who now earn their living in small enterprises
do the same work, but for much lower pay. Nor are they assured of
regular work. Jani and Joshi described how they fared after the first
round of closures in the mid 1980s. In his description, Joshi emphasizes
the loss of security and regularity.

>Since mills closed down and they became jobless, the owners of closed textile
mills or their associates gave them casual daily work in powerlooms. In the
absence of any viable alternative, the unemployed workers of the closed textile
mills were forced to accept this casualization. Thus the master is unchanged and
the worker is also unchanged but the pattern of master-servant relationship has
changed. In old composite textile mills the worker was getting a salary of around
₹800 per month. He was also getting other benefits like leave, provident fund,
or gratuity, bonus and medical facility. While in powerlooms the same worker is
getting around ₹15 per day and this payment is for a work of 12 hours which
violates the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act. Though this is known as
daily wage, the payment is made twice in a month. The average monthly income
of a loom worker is ₹160 when he or she was a permanent worker on the mill,
it was extremely difficult to dispense with his or her services at will. Whereas in
a powerloom unit he or she can be asked not to come to work the next day. (Joshi
1986: 149--50)

In his report, Jani quotes a worker on the substitution of time-rated
wages for job work.

>We are 32 workers. Each worker has to work on 2 machines. We will get 13 paise
per metre. Also dearness allowance of Rs five and twenty-five paise for eight
hours! All this amounts to ₹10--12 per day! This is our condition. In mills, we
were getting ₹40 per day and here in powerloom, we are getting ₹10--12 per
day. This supervisor has also stopped giving work since two days. Another
supervisor contacted our owner and said that he will bring his own labourers and
will get him more production than what he is getting at present. He demanded
₹1,400. So, now our labourers are jobless! He got the contract. (Jani 1984: 13)

Patel recorded the situation of 5,573 sacked mill workers during the
same period. Less than half had managed to find new jobs, earning an
average daily wage of around ₹11 to 12 (Patel 1988: 44). Later studies,
summarized in Table 6.3, provide a similar picture. Masihi presents the
figures for ex-workers dismissed from 16 textile companies between
1985 and 1987, while Noronha's figures are based on a survey of workers
who were all made redundant by the same mill when it closed in 1994.

In a follow-up study of 1,729 former mill workers, for which data
were collected between 1995 and 1997, Patel calculated that wage
labourers were now earning an average of ₹870 per month while ownaccount
workers had an average monthly income of ₹837. One striking
outcome was that, among the latter group, rickshaw drivers were the
highest earners, with ₹1,156, while those who earned a living in
industry were way below the average, at ₹723 (Patel 1997:28). This
was the meagre income which home-workers in particular had to settle
for, while another empirical study in 1996 showed that powerloom
workers earned slightly more, averaging ₹830 per month (Howell and
Kambhampati 1997: 40). According to this study, the wage in the
powerloom units was half of what the mill workers had formerly earned,
₹48.33 compared to ₹96.07. But even this amount was far higher
than former mill workers could expect to earn in other areas of activity,
where the average was as little as ₹34.60. The results of our own survey
in 1998 confirm the pattern that had emerged during these earlier
studies. Most respondents who earned a daily wage of between ₹90 and
100 at the time of closure --- at eight hours a day, six days a week, this
amounted to between ₹2,000 and ₹2,500 per month --- now earn less
than half of that, while a sizeable minority has to make do with less than
a third of what they earned before.

: Survey of 135 ex-mill workers[^tab63b-source]

[^tab63b-source]: Noronha. Survey of 135 ex-mill workers.

This fall in income is so dramatic that other members of the household
have to sell their labour power. In our survey nearly half of all
households (264 out of a total of 600) were forced to engage at least two
members in gainful employment. In the past, this was not necessary, or
to a much lesser extent. A record at the TLA office of 500 workers sacked
in 1985 shows that only 20% came from families with more than
one working member (Masihi 1993: 18). Except for a few who had
secondary sources of income --- as owner of a _pan_/cigarette stall, musician,
barber, renting out a handcart or rickshaw, etc.--- the mill was the
only source of income on which the household budget was based. The
stigmatization of _Dalits_ also made it difficult for their wives to find paid
work, Muslim women were not permitted to work outside the home,
while the higher Hindu castes, such as the _Patels_, were restricted by
similar taboos. The wage brought home by the man of the house was
sufficient to allow these customs to be observed or imposed, but after the
closure of the mills there was no longer the financial freedom to tolerate
such sensitivities. Home-working allowed Muslim and some Hindu
women to take an active part in earning income for the household
without them having to break the social code for public behaviour.
Sewing and embroidery, making incense sticks (_agarbati_), and rolling
cigarettes (_bidis_) are prime examples of activities in which all household
members, particularly women and children, can take part. But in many
cases, women and children also have to take part in work outside the
house. They are employed in garment ateliers but may also have to roam
around in the streets.

>At present, I am not the Chief Minister of Gujarat. But I managed to start this
ice-lari by obtaining money on request. I am to give interest at the rate of 7%. Due to competition in this business also, I am not getting anything. Daily
from morning till evening, my wife goes to the streets and _poles_, collecting waste
paper. She collects paper worth ₹2 or ₹2,50 and with that we can have our
food. It is eating food of charity. (Jani 1984: 10)

Collecting paper and other waste (such as scrap metal or empty plastic
bottles) which has a low status and earns very little, is the speciality of
_Dalit_ women and girls. Jhabvala provides more detailed information
about their daily routine.

>These women start from home at 5 a.m. and walk around the city with sacks on
their backs. Often they take small children with them who also carry a small sack.
Each woman has her beat. Some beats are in the middle class residential area,
some in the market area and some in the industrial area. They walk from 6 a.m.
to 3 p.m. an average of ten kilometres a day. They say it is tiring work. Their
backs often pain, and since they have to work through dirty heaps they get bitten
by insects and an occasional scorpion ...

### Casual Labour and Absence of Collective Representation

Without exception our informants described their current situation as
'miserable' in comparison with the life they led as mill workers. They
then went on to explain why this was so. The textile workers were not a
homogeneous group and those who belonged to the mass at the base of
the labour hierarchy in the mills --- the low-skilled, the lowest paid and
usually members of the most vulnerable social categories --- have suffered
more than the relatively small percentage of much better-paid employees:
those equipped with vocational education or who were employed a
clerical or managerial staff. We are not in a position to say what
happened to these higher qualified and better positioned employees after
they were dismissed. The aim of our study was to shed light on the fate
of the large subaltern mass that comprised an estimated four-fifths of the
workforce. Were they, despite their subordinate position at the base of
the hierarchy in the textile mills, an aristocracy among the working
population of Ahmedabad? The use of this term can easily lead to an
exaggerated image of the previous comforts of the industrial vanguard in
terms of welfare, security, and protection. This view requires immediate
modification given, for instance, the industrial diseases that affected the
health of the mill workers sooner or later. Many suffered from bysinossis,
a disease of the lungs caused by the inhalation of cotton dust, which
particularly affected those involved in the initial stages of the production
process. Doctors treated the complaint as tuberculosis and the trade
union refused to hold the mill owners responsible for the consequences ---
partial and eventually full incapacity to work.

>The issue came to a head with the closure of the mills in the late 1980s. The
compensation on offer did not provide for work-related illnesses such as bysinossis.
In order to address the problem a number of concerned individuals started the
Bysinossis Campaign, the leader being a former TLA official. Disenchanted with
the Gandhian union and aware of the importance of health and safety matters in
the cotton textile industry he devoted his energies to ensuring that workers with
bysinossis received compensation. The effectiveness of the campaign has been an
embarrassment to the TLA which might have been expected to, if not initiate,
then at least cooperate in these efforts. (Howell and Kambhampati 1997:46)

A survey conducted by the Factory Inspectorate in Ahmedabad showed
that, of 7,000 employees tested, a quarter were suffering from bysinossis
to some degree (Howell and Kambhampati 1997:30; Mishra 1992).
While accepting that the prevailing conditions in the mills left much to
be desired, it should nevertheless be noted that the workers themselves
considered their dismissal from the mill as a fall from paradise. In my
view, this says more about the shortcomings of the miserable situation
they now find themselves in than how fine and enviable things used to
be. Noronha rightly concludes that the first loss suffered by the sacked
mill workers was that of security of work (1999: 103). Only a very few of
our respondents succeeded in finding a new permanent job on formal
sector terms of employment after being made redundant, in either the
private or public sector. A slightly larger number belonged to households
where another member --- a son or brother --- was in the envied position
of having steady paid work (a total of 30 of the 600 households in our
survey). This small minority however only confirms the rule that the
majority were condemned to earn a living from casual and incidental
work. Chowdhury notes that none of his sample population of 250
sacked mill workers or any members of their households had found a
permanent job (1996: 9--10). More typical than the length of the
working day --- much longer than in the mill --- is the irregular rhythm of
the work. While the demands on the labour power can sometimes be
extremely strenuous and lengthy, there are long spells --- hours or days
and even weeks --- of enforced idleness. One of our respondents told us
that 'there is no longer a regular pattern to our lives'. Those who have
been lucky enough to find a new job have to make do with half or even
less of the salary they earned at the mill. The majority now earn far less
than the statutory minimum for unskilled labour established by the
government of Gujarat for a large number of trades and industries(Patel
1988: 44--5). The deterioration in earnings is partly due to the fundamental
change from a time-wage to piece-rate or job work. This change
has affected workers across the board, not just those who are selfemployed.
Since they are no longer paid according to the hours they have
worked, but on the basis of the work they have done, permanent and
casual wage workers also miss out on time-based benefits to which they
are entitled under industrial legislation.

>The present job is not a job to my liking. I am just passing my time. There are no
benefits such as allowances for boots, cloth, cycle and so on. (Noronha 1999:104)

Complaints like this about having to bear the costs of all kinds of
expenses that used to be covered by the employer are in my view not so
mu related to the actual perks, which are relatively minor, as to the fact
that it reduces labour to a commodity and ignores the fact that workers
are also people. The new situation has necessitated forms of self-exploitation,
such as extending the working day and forcing dependent members
of the household to search for gainful employment at home or outside,
where this was previously not necessary.

Was there no resistance to this far-reaching restructuring of the labour
regime? The dismantling of the large-scale textile industry in Ahmedabad
was a process that unfolded over a period of many years, but at no point
were the victims able to mount a sustained or concerted protest. As Patel
and others have noted, there is much bitterness and agitation.

>They had their own trade union and are politically conscious, and clearly
understand the injustice and wrong done to them by society. Although lack of
violence and militancy despite large scale job losses is to some extent due to
Gandhian influence and partly due to the docile nature of these workers, it was
not surprising to meet several of them in highly agitated mood, cursing the
society for the loss of their job and the callous neglect by society to support them
and their families. Some of them openly felt that at least their children should go
for anti-social activities and learn how to use guns as they do not see any future
for those who are honest and hard working. (Patel 1997: 22--23)

The trade union, which could have channelled these frustrations into
constructive action, was prevented from doing so by a doctrine that
preached industrial peace, and a willingness to make concessions and
seek compromises at all times. This ideology explains why the TLA
leadership failed to take decisive action at the most critical moment. The
Gandhian strategy to which the union leaders adhered on principle in
the decades preceding the closures had undeniably produced many
benefits for their members, not least because of the great political
influence of the union both in Gujarat and nationally. In addition to
higher wages, this well-organized political pressure resulted in a body of
advanced industrial legislation and a tripartite framework for implementing
it. But at the critical moment, when they should have insisted
that the agreements be honoured, the leaders made a conscious decision
not to mount an organized protest against the mass redundancies,
thereby abandoning the acquired rights of the workers. After first referring
to what the union had achieved it its heyday, Howell and Kambhampati
focus their attention in clear and unambiguous terms on its
less illustrious response when the crisis broke out.

> ... the lack of competitive pressure on these monopolistic trade unions has made
them, over time, less responsive and accountable to their worker constituencies,
resulting not only in a widening gap between their leadership and members but
also in their increasing ineffectiveness as agencies of representation and interest
articulation. The complacency which has arisen due to their long existence and
monopoly position has left them ill-equipped to meet the challenges of restructuring
and propose alternatives that are both feasible and acceptable to workers.
Moreover the nature of implicit contract has led to their eventual 'capture' by
management, as reflected in their failure to mount any serious challenge in the
restructuring process. (Howell and Kambhampati 1997: 8)

Of course, Gandhi's high-caste disciples made every effort to build up
strong labour movement, which would have been impossible without
their leadership, but the solidarity they envisaged was based on recognition
of the separate group identities of caste and religion to which the
union's members belonged. Their main priority was not to form a united
front of labour against capital, but a civilizing mission designed to raise
the working masses to a higher material --- and, above all, moral --- plane.
In an earlier chapter I have quoted Masihi who labelled the TLA
explicitly as a conservative trade union because its chosen strategy helped
to strengthen primordial loyalties, and thereby eroded the solidarity of
the working class (Masihi 1985: 196). On the other hand, it should be
noted that other trade unions with a more radical agenda had little
success in the working class districts of Ahmedabad in spite of determined
efforts throughout the twentieth century. It cannot be ignored
that the caste and religious identities, which were accentuated not only
by the division of labour in the mills but also by a policy of residential
segregation in the textile districts, were the primary source of care and
protection after the mass redundancies. This occurred in a situation in
which not only employers and the government, but also their own
representatives, had come to accept the expulsion of this mass of workers
from the formal sector of the economy as a _fait accompli_.

It was to this network of primordial loyalties that the former mill
workers turned for help after losing their jobs. Was their return to a far
lower status in the labour market in any way connected to differentiated
sources of favouritism and nepotism that constitute the social capital of
these formations? There are indications to this effect in the stereotypes
that certain groups always have of others: the _Patels_, for example, are
said to stick together and to favour their fellow caste members above
outsiders. Muslim workers who also prefer regular paid work to casual
labour claim, with good reason, to suffer discrimination by other
groups, leaving the majority of them with little other choice than to start
working as own-account operators. _Dalits_ --- at least in the eyes of other
groups --- are the favourites of the government and can therefore claim
priority in vacancies for low-grade public sector jobs. They are affected,
however, by the drive for privatization and, as a consequence, the
much reduced employment opportunities in the municipal or state
bureaucracy.

These examples show that in the new labour market hierarchy social
clusters that reflect the inegalitarian structure of society as a whole
continue to exist. Clearly, in the search for work, one should take
account of these separated niches and mobilize the social capital that
went together with it. Still, this does not mean that the configuration of
occupations is solely determined by ties of caste and religion. Individual
characteristics and choices, to a large extent determined by fortune or
misfortune, can also be decisive in practice. What is demonstrably
lacking, however, is the capacity to improve one's lot through collective
bargaining. This is not to say that no efforts are made to strike a better
deal, but the visibility of such codes of conduct is slight because they are
restricted to the actions of individuals who first and foremost try to
promote their own interests. Why this does not take the form of a united
front is explained by the fact that the former mill workers are now
engaged in types of employment that have led them to be dispersed over
a highly diverse pattern of activities and work sites. Patel charted this
fragmentation during his first study of dismissed mill workers in 1984.
2,464 had found regular paid work or were self-employed. For more
than half of these, he is able to provide a detailed description of the
nature of their work. The full list of the wide variety of occupations
practised by nearly 60% of the survey sample is included at the
end of this chapter as an annexe. A schematic regrouping into a number
of branches of industry and divided according to wage labour or working
at own expense produces the following classification.

The 1,410 former mill workers who Patel records as formerly working
under the same regime in the past are now scattered over no less than 143
occupations, an average of less than ten per occupation, which they
practise either at fixed sites in Ahmedabad or by moving around in the
streets throughout the city. Clearly, such large-scale fragmentation, further
complicated by varying workplaces, spatial dispersal, and different
modes of payment, present a significant obstacle to efforts aimed at
collective action. The desperate need to find income come what may is
an incentive not to respect earlier established lines of demarcation but to
intrude into job niches associated with other caste or communal identities.
The open competition acts as a lever for political strife between Muslims,
O.B.C.s and _Dalits_, at the bottom of the urban economy.

The memory of a past in which labour had dignity is still alive for
many of the former mill workers. One informant used an example
also quoted by Noronha to describe his dissatisfaction about his new
employment --- the habit of the owners of powerloom workshops not to
give their employees a wage slip to specify the various items on their wage
bills. The realization that they are being used as a disposable commodity
and having to do all kinds of additional tasks that have nothing to do
with the actual work, just because the employer says so, creates a feeling
of powerlessness and lack of self-respect.

>Today you need influence even at the '_nakas_' to get work for a day. Masons only
take you if they know you. We can get mill jobs only through donations.' 'If we
(younger men) cannot get work, how can the older ones manage? I have been
doing temporary jobs very often. Nobody needs us. I consider myself as a third
class person.' 'I never washed cups before. My present employer now takes
advantage of my difficulty. I have to work on holidays and even scrub the floors.
He does not even ask me whether I had my lunch. Instead he sucks my blood.
(Noronha 1999: 102--4)

The management of modern large-scale industrial enterprises often
reject applications from former mill workers because they are older and
worn out, and lack the flexibility to adapt to the higher work rate
required by the new technology. They prefer younger and fitter workers.
But Howell and Kambhapati, referring to these discriminatory practices
point out that the smaller companies also often refuse to take on former
mill workers, even though they are better equipped to operate the
machines than newcomers with less experience, because of the way they
assert themselves.

>There has been much less investment in modernisation in this sector. However,
very few of the employers in this sector are willing to take on former mill workers
as they feel they are likely to have picked up 'bad habits' in the mills. Given the
considerably poorer working conditions in the powerloom sector, this is probably
a safe step. The powerloom sector does not need to comply with any of the
employment and dismissal conditions that are binding on the mill sector.
Workers within this sector are also largely non-unionised and they are employed
on a casual basis. Former mill workers, used to better employment conditions,
could cause unrest amongst the workforce with comparisons between the working
conditions. (Howell and Kambhampati 1997: 35)

Did the TLA not provide any assistance in finding new employment?
One informant replied to this question with a sneer that he had been
offered an _ambar charkha_ (spinning wheel) at a very cheap price. This
was greeted with much laughter and nodding of heads. Another added
that 'instead of giving our children computer lessons, they try and send
us back to our former state of deprivation with old reject machinery'.
This animosity is understandable if we remember that these workers
produced textiles on modern machines for many years and are very
reluctant to return to hand-spinning which demands a lot of effort and
generates insufficient income to survive.

Our conclusion that the TLA leaders betrayed the trust of the union's
members is not based only on the fact that they proved neither willing
nor able to direct the protest of the mill workers during the mass
redundancies. Their passive role at this juncture was followed by an even
greater blunder: they decided that dismissal from the mill also meant
that workers lost their union membership. The former members did not
even have a chance to cancel their own membership formally. Collection
of their contributions was stopped once their mill wages were no longer
paid, and this meant that their names were scrapped from the list of
members. The issue was never discussed at a union meeting. Instead of
taking a stand on behalf of the workers when they were ejected from the
formal sector of the economy, the Gandhian union leaders left them to
their fate. This is how the workers themselves see what happened: they
were not disloyal to the union, but vice versa. The TLA turned its back
on them. I will return to the eclipse of the textile workers' union, which
had 135,000 members during its heyday in the early 1970s, in the next
chapter.

### Retraining and Occupational Counsellin

The National Renewal Fund launched in 1992 as part of the new
economic policy was heralded as a social safety net (see Nandralog, ILO 1999). In addition to paying out compensation to the redundant mill
workers it was also meant to retrain them and help them re-enter the
labour market. As we have seen, the pledge to provide compensation for
the jobs lost was broken on a very large scale. So what became of the
support schemes, launched with such a flurry of pomp and publicity?
First of all, what was eventually spent on retraining was only a fraction of
the already meagre budget originally earmarked for this objective.

> ... more than 95% of the funds have been utilised only for retrenching
workers (approx. ₹1500 crores); the total funds spent on retraining are only
about one % and practically nothing has been done for generating more
employment in the affected centres by way of specific programmes under the
NRF. (Patel 1997:30, for a no less damning criticism see Hirway 2000: 3112).

As early as 1985, the government had requested the Gandhi Labour
Institute in Ahmedabad to conduct a survey among the mill workers
who had been made redundant. The results of this study, published in
book form by B.B. Patel in 1988, proved useful several years later when
a plan of action was drawn up to rehabilitate the rapidly growing number
of closure victims through retraining and occupational counselling. It
must be concluded that very little came of this scheme (see Howell and
Kambhampati 1997 41--- ). With the Gandhi Labour Institute as nodal
agency, Employee Resource Centres were opened to stimulate the former
mill workers to apply for retraining, to inform them about the prospects
for other work and, to advise them how best to make productive use of
their redundancy payments (when and if received). It proved, however,
difficult to interest the workers in these activities. Between 1994, when
the retraining programme started, and early 1998 no more than 7,000
former mill workers took part, much fewer than had been expected. This
was partly due to the criteria imposed for admission to the programme.
The facility was open only to men who could prove that they had a
permanent job at the time of closure (thereby disqualifying in advance
women, _badli_ and regular workers who had been dismissed before the
actual closure), who were younger than 55 at the time they registered for
the programme, and who had at least completed their primary education.
Nevertheless, the majority of the dismissed workers fulfilled these
criteria. So why did they not register for the programme in much greater
numbers?

Announcements in newspapers, flyers distributed in the industrial
neighbourhoods, and posters in the Labour Welfare Centres disseminated
information on the rehabilitation and retraining schemes. The
most important reason for this lukewarm response appeared to be a lack
of confidence in the practical value of the programme, a view that proved
to be well founded. The training courses on offer were mainly aimed at
technical occupations, such as electrician, tailor, carpenter, plumber,
motor mechanic, radio repairman or diamond polisher. It was also
possible to enlist for driving lessons. The courses were given by qualified
instructors, usually in existing vocational or industrial training centres.
The training given was, however, much shorter than similar full-fledged
courses for younger and full-time applicants, lasting fifty days at the
most, with three to four hours of lessons a day, spread over two to three
months. Candidates were not assigned to courses according to their own
preference but on the basis of available vacancies. They therefore had no
say in which new occupation they were to receive training. There was
little protest among the selected candidates because many only signed up
to receive the daily allowance of ₹40 and did not even bother to attend
the lessons daily. Their instructors did not report their absence because
they would lose out on the ₹9,000 per head in course fees. The
carpenter's training consisted of learning how to make a small wooden
bench. I can still remember a class of men, all around middle age, with
makeshift tools and an evident lack of skill sitting despondently together,
trying to create some proof of their newly gained ability.

The scepticism with which the unemployed workers viewed the
utility of the training courses in advance was primarily founded on the
complete absence of any guarantee that they would be able to practice
what they had learnt after completing the courses. With its new economic
policy of liberalization taking shape, the government was neither
able nor willing to bear any responsibility for generating employment.
The records of the Gandhi Labour Institute show that three-quarters of
the workers who took part in one of the training courses did not find
work in their new occupation (Patel 1997: 34). My own impressions,
based on conversations with several dozen former course participants,
suggest that this is an optimistic estimate. According to a recently
published NGO report, only one out of ten workers who attended a
course has been able to land a job in line with their training (Vikas
report, n.d.). In addition to the complete lack of any assistance in
looking for a new job, the participants were also not furnished with the
basic tools required to practice their new skills. Although ₹1,800 had
been allocated per successful participant for the purchase of a toolbox
(such as a sewing machine for tailors, a set of tools for carpenters or
motor mechanics), in many cases these were not provided, while some
trainees sold whatever was handed out as soon as the course was completed.
All things considered, it is not surprising that interest in taking
part in the courses dropped to an even lower level before this industrial
retraining facility was phased out altogether in 2002. It is difficult to
avoid the impression that the decision to introduce the retraining and
occupational counselling scheme was motivated more by a desire on the
part of the government and politicians to make a show of support, at a
time when public opinion was still quite sensitive to the problem of mass
redundancies, than by an honest and resolute attempt to 'recycle' the lost
labour expelled from the cotton mills.

What was presented by the government as a social safety net was
expressly intended to prepare the former mill workers for future selfemployment
--- in contrast to their previous status as permanent waged
labour --- at their own risk and expense. A few training courses therefore
aimed not to teach particular occupational skills but gave instruction on
how to start a micro-enterprise. The promotion of small-scale business
also included the advocacy of modest bank loans to provide seed capital.
Masihi enquired whether his respondents in the mill districts were aware
of this facility. Nearly half said they were; 30 had submitted an application,
but only three ultimately received any credit (Masihi 1993: 78).
Patel calculated that, of the 1,400 applications submitted by former mill
workers for loans from state banks to set up their own businesses, an
almost negligible percentage were ever actually granted, and even then ---
after a procedure that took nearly one and a half years --- only half the
amount of money requested (Patel 1997: 35). This was confirmed by a
government official at a meeting I attended to mark the end of a course
to train former mill workers to be rickshaw drivers. After the speeches,
the participants were asked if they had anything to say. There was only
one question: how were they to get the money --- ₹75,000--- to buy a
rickshaw? The reply that they could apply for a bank loan was accompanied
by a veiled warning that, without sufficient security, they stood no
chance of acquiring one. Information leaflets gave the impression that it
was easy to acquire loans, but the former textile workers knew better.
Most of them had such a low level of solvency that they were refused on
these grounds alone. Those who stuck it out long enough to finally
become eligible for a loan were charged all manner of costs that never
appeared in the official accounts. It often happened that they had to sign
for a much higher amount than they actually got. They were forced to
pay 'donations' to middlemen at various stages between application and
approval of the loan, making it much more expensive than it was on
paper. A few of the informants that I met in the course of my study had
decided to set up their own business after being dismissed from the mill.
It was a hazardous undertaking, and not always successful. One worker
used his redundancy payment to buy an expensive machine for producing
simple plastic articles. He managed to learn how to operate and
maintain the machine. But his business, which he ran single-handedly,
soon got into trouble because he had insufficient knowledge of the
market for his products, how to organize the sales side, and how to keep
basic administrative records. His earlier experience as a skilled factory
worker had not prepared him for these tasks.

By making the transition from permanent waged employment to
working at one's own risk and expense the established norm, the government
displayed a disturbing lack of insight into what this change entailed
for the unemployed textile workers themselves. Politicians and bureaucrats
saw micro-enterprise as the driving force of a new existence for
these workers in the informal sector of the urban economy. Without
even the minimum capital and know-how, the victims of the closures
were sent out into the streets to earn a living as petty commodity
producers. That only a few eventually went for this option was not
difficult to foresee. Yet the fiction of self-employment is preserved in the
pretence that those who work as casual labourers went for to do so. The
reality is that the majority are by no means their own bosses and would
much prefer regular and waged employment to being forced to perform
all kinds of jobs to make ends meet. Self-employment requires the
possession of the means of production and other forms of social capital
which the majority of workers do not have and cannot afford with the
restricted budgets at their disposal: the purchase of equipment such as a
sewing machine, a simple stall for pressing clothes or repairing shoes, a
handcart to sell vegetables, snacks or drinks, a cycle or cart to deliver.
goods, money to pay for a driving licence or a licence to sell paraffin. In
addition to all this they need cash for _hafta_, the bribes to a policeman, a
wholesale trader or anyone else with power over the arena in which
workers in the informal sector practise their trade or craft. Ismail Shaikh
sells lottery tickets in his small makeshift cabin. He used to work in the
weaving department of the Monogram Mill for twenty years until the
day of his dismissal.

>We have seven members in our household. I took to rickshaw driving in the hope
that I would buy a rickshaw on loan. But in vain. Drove rickshaw on hire-basis
for some time. Then did some masonry work. Then did wood chopping. And
now I have opened this lottery centre. I manage to get around ₹10 daily. But
this municipality harasses me, the bastards took away my cabin in the name of
encroachment and gave me a fine of ₹88. (Jani 1984: 4)

The majority of former mill workers continue to steadfastly ignore the
wishes of the authorities and continue to look for waged employment. In
the absence of permanent work, they have to settle for casual labour, but
this by far outweighs those who choose to eke out a living at their own
expense. The results of our own survey are confirmed by a sample list of
3,000 workers who reported in 1996 for occupational counselling in one
of the Labour Welfare Centres situated in the mill districts. Of this
batch, 48% said they were engaged in wage labour, 32%
worked at their own expense, and the rest were unemployed. The average
monthly income in the first two categories was almost the same, at ₹829 and ₹840 respectively. This also confirmed once again that the
earnings of those who managed to find paid work after their dismissal
from the mill were about a third of their former level (Patel and Suzuki
1997: 43). My conclusion is that neither industrial retraining nor any
other state-sponsored efforts at rehabilitation have effected a turn for the
better after the dramatic and sudden decline in the quality of the
working life of the former mill workers.
