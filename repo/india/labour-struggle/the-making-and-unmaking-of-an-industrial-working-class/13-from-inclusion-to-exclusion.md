## From Inclusion to Exclusion

### The Absence of a Social Safety Net

In 1933 a book was published, entitled _Die Arbeitslosen von Marienthal_.
It was an empirical study of the effects of long-term unemployment. The
book became a classic in social scientific literature on the significance of
the loss of paid employment for working-class households in an industrial
society. Jahoda, Lazarsfeld and Zeisel had written the study in
German and this was initially an obstacle to its distribution. Although
the principal authors left Austria in the 1930s, the work did not appear
in English translation until long after the Second World War, in 1973.[^13/1]
The setting of the study was a small community some distance from
Vienna which had one large textile mill and not much else by way of
economic activity. After cutbacks in production and working hours in
the late 1920s, against the background of the economic crisis which
affected the whole of industrial Europe, the mill closed in 1930. This
meant the end of what was essentially the only source of employment in
the rural township. With the complete workforce made redundant, no
less than three-quarters of the local population, 367 of the 478 households,
found themselves in a situation of acute poverty. The authors put
their account, based on participatory observation, on record as _Die müde
Gesellschaft_ (The Tired Community). This subtitle expressed the feelings
of powerlessness and hopelessness that held these people in grip. Only a
small proportion of the population managed to stay in work, in the
service sector outside the village, and a number of older people received
a pension. The study describes the response of the affected households in
subsequent phases: how they proceeded from initial resolve to resignation,
going on to despair and finally apathy. The social psychological approach
illustrates how these people lost their sense of time and how the daily
routine, which is so important for a meaningful life, was eroded. Outside
the household, it was a life of isolation, a declining involvement in the
world outside, institutionally and organizationally, and all kind of symptoms
of envy and suspicion instead of mutual help. The tenor is clear: a
process of marginalization, a shrinking of the psychological space, leading
to alienation.

[^13/1]: The renewed interest in unemployment and its societal impact resulted in a new
edition of the study by German social scientists, also in a French translation published,
with a preface written by Pierre Bourdieu, in 1997.


Did the same fate befall the much larger mass of workers in Ahmedabad
after they lost their jobs in the large textile mills? It is not difficult to
identify a wide variety of similarities and I will come back to this
repeatedly in this closing part of my study. This does not mean that there
are not significant differences between Ahmedabad and _Marienthal_. In
the first place, only a little over a quarter of those who lost their jobs in
Ahmedabad have been affected by long-term unemployment. Even this
percentage is open to question because many gave 'valid' reasons for not
re-entering the labour market, such as old age or ill health. The great
majority could simply not afford to stop working, even though their
monthly income had fallen to below half of what they used to earn. And
that is the question that immediately arises when reading _Marienthal_:
how did those Austrian workers who were unemployed for a long time
survive, under the most miserable of circumstances? Certainly not through
paid employment but by partially retreating into self-sufficiency. They
grew vegetables or bred rabbits on a small piece of land rented to them by
the mill or the local council. Much more important than these modest
contributions towards enforced autarky, however, was the state unemployment
benefit which they received every 14 days. The economic cycle
of the households affected by the mill closure revolved around this paltry
payout. The benefits were funded from contributions by employers,
workers, and the local authority and the total accumulated in the years
leading up to the closure meant that there were enough funds to last for
20 or 30 weeks. After that, the dismissed workers were eligible for the
lower benefits in the form of a government dole. Sporadically, such as on
religious holidays, the municipality or charity organizations would issue
them food packages. In the early 1930s the welfare state in Europe was
still under construction. It was not expanded and completed until well
after the end of the Second World War, but the foundations had already
been laid in the early years of the twentieth century. When the economic
crisis struck in the early 1930s, governments in the industrialized part of
the world responded to the sudden onset of unemployment and impoverishment
with relief programmes. These took the form of both financial
support and job creation by commissioning public works.[^13/2] In Ahmedabad,
a large urban economy which may have been in need of drastic restructuring
during the final decades of the twentieth century but was certainly
not in a state of general crisis, such public intervention to alleviate the
suffering of the victims remained completely absent. The message from
policymakers was that the dismissed workers should seek refuge in the
informal sector which, according to the prevailing doctrine of infinite
elasticity in such circles, could easily absorb this new influx. But, as we
have seen, this wishful thinking was not fulfilled. To supplement the
extremely low income earned by the former mill workers, either as wage
labourers or self-employment in the informal sector, more members of
the household had to become economically active than was necessary
before. Incidentally, I have my reservations about the information that
the wage earned at the mill by the male head of the household was
previously the only source of income. The union subscribed to this
fiction because Gandhi's concept of a living wage was based on the
assumption that the woman would stay at home to care for the family.
Consequently, whenever surveys were carried out the workers themselves
insisted that their work at the mills was the household's only source of
income in order to be eligible for financial support.[^13/3] During my fieldwork
in the industrial localities, however, I observed that in many
households, the women were long accustomed to doing paid work.
Nevertheless, while in the past their contribution expanded the family's
financial horizons, after the loss of their husbands' jobs at the mill it
became an indispensable part of their efforts to survive with a far lower
standard of living. But one thing is absolutely clear --- the need to send
children out to work, often at a very early age, has shifted the balance in
the household from those exempted from work to those required to
contribute to the income of the household. Yet even this shift between
dependent and non-dependent members has not been able to halt the
process of impoverishment.

[^13/2]: After escaping from Nazi Austria, Jahoda, the leading author of _Marienthal_, resumed
her study of the effects of long-term unemployment. Shortly after arriving in England she
undertook a study of unemployed miners in Wales. Her report pointed out that in
addition to receiving financial support from the government, these men were also able to
take part in an experimental job creation project run by a non-governmental organization,
which generated additional income through payment in kind (see Jahoda 1989).

[^13/3]: 'Information about the earners has to be accepted with some amount of reservation,
because many workers had a feeling that if they showed that they have more than one
earner in their families, then they will not be eligible to receive help from the government
(or any other agency).' (Masihi 1993: 68)


At the centre of this narrative are the workers who lost their jobs
during the final quarter of the last century as a result of the closure of
several dozens of textile mills. Together they make up a considerable mass
of people: around 85,000, mostly men, who all had permanent jobs at
the mills. But they were not the only ones to lose their jobs and income
with the decline of the textile industry. Before the permanent workforce
was made redundant, the mill owners had already started laying off the
_badli_, the reserve labourers who worked the shifts when one of the
regulars was absent or when production capacity had to be increased
temporarily to complete a large order. The size of this reserve labour force
varied from mill to mill, but averaged 25 to 30% of the permanent
workforce. The _badli_, who were permanently on call but only sporadically
employed in the final stage of mill production, had no rights. They
always hoped that their temporary status, which could sometimes last 10
years or more, would be converted into permanent employment. The
mill owners had no formal obligations towards the reserve labour force at
all, so their laying off in the years leading up to the mass closures caused
little commotion. Since the modality of their employment fulfilled the
conditions for working in the informal sector, it was easy to argue that
the loss of their tenuous situation at the mill led to little change in their
means of existence.

The same applied to another large category of victims, the contract
workers. Part of this category comprised workers who performed activities
that were formerly done by the regular mill employees, but which
had been separated from the production process and contracted out. The
mill owners had discovered this strategy at the end of the 1960s to reduce
the cost price and hopefully to stem falling profits. Howell and
Kambhampati describe an example of this practice in a textile mill that
had, so far, escaped closure.

>Reliance Industries, for example, has 8000 regular employees and 200 indirect
employees or contract workers. The latter do the loading, unloading, materials
handling, cutting and packing. A senior manager in this company explained that
while such subcontracting could lower costs, it also reduced control over production
facilities. Mar Yagnik of Ahima Group indicated that they have only 35
subcontracted workers in the section where the final inspection is done and the
cloth is folded. While they have a modern dye-house where all processes can be
undertaken, printing is subcontracted out since it is low-tech and they cannot
therefore compete with the smaller processes in this field. (Howell and
Kambhampati 1997: 19)

A second form of subcontracting goes even further. It entails separating
activities from the production process and delegating them to subcontractors
who remain outside the core of the factory workforce. They take
their own gangs with them to the shopfloor and supervise these themselves.
This enabled the employers to evade labour legislation and
resulted in women, who had lost their permanent jobs many years ago,
returning to the factories as cheap labour. According to a different
source, no less than 10% of the workforce in the mills in
Ahmedabad in the mid-1980s was employed through this form of
internal subcontracting.

> ... by 1984 contract labour was a regular feature of the following departments:
bobbin cleaning, winding and low reeling, mending coal, engineering and/or
construction, printing, spinning, canteen, sweeping, folding card and/or stamping,
kharaba and falatu. In this study's estimation at least 10% of the
textile workforce in Ahmedabad was employed in this fashion. They were
earning low wages, and most of them were not even registered under the
Contract Labour and Regulation Act. (Patel 1987: 13; _see also_ Howell and
Kambhampati 1997: 20)

The leading trade union in Ahmedabad was criticized for approving this
form of contracting labour, instead of protesting against it (Jhabvala
1985: 23; Mehta 1997: 14). Finally, the mass redundancies had a knockon
effect on labour outside the large-scale textile industry. One group
that found itself in trouble was the women who bought the waste from
the production of cotton cloth, to make patchwork blankets (Howell
and Kambhampati 1997: 36). This shows that the effects of the closures
on employment extended further than just the permanent workforce in
the mills. This ripple effect attracted little attention because these invisible
workers were already in a more vulnerable position. They fell outside
the protective regime of the formal sector and, although they were
heavily hit by the closure of the mills, their lives did not take such a
dramatic turn for the worse as those who had been in permanent and
secure employment in the mills.

The multiplier effect of this impoverishment was even greater as a
result of the drastically reduced turnover of small retailers and craftsmen,
and those providing transport and other services in the industrial districts.
The former mill workers who constituted their customers now had
far less to spend on their products and services and, consequently, many
of these petty owners had to shut shop or at least lay off their helpers.
Visitors to the mill districts soon become aware of the all-embracing
poverty that permeates this large part of Ahmedabad, once the industrial
heart of the city. The buses on these routes are the oldest in the city,
wrecks on wheels which belong to the scrap heap. Public facilities, such
as waste collection, are seriously lacking and the maintenance of streets
and buildings has been severely neglected. The people who live in these
slums seem to have adapted their daily lives to this degenerated landscape.

### Impoverishment

How has the fall in the living standards of the former mill workers
manifested itself? To answer this question I focused the fieldwork I
conducted between February and April 1998 and September and November
1999 on 60 households. They were selected from a larger group
of 600 households to reflect a variety of social identities, age ranges, jobs
in the mills, and years of redundancy. They are dispersed among different
neighbourhoods: Bapunagar, Rakhial, Rajpur-Gomtipur, Behrampura,
Amraiwadi, and Naroda. As I mentioned earlier, this industrial working
class was not a homogeneous group, either in terms of their personal
characteristics, the jobs they had performed in the mills, or their rate of
pay. The majority of the dismissed workers in the households I visited
had done jobs that were at the centre of the production process, such as
spinning and weaving, or had worked as cleaners, guards, etc. There were
very few of the better paid technicians, administrative and managerial
staff among the households I visited, but there is insufficient evidence to
conclude that better qualified workers suffered less from impoverishment
after being made redundant. Most of them found other work more
quickly and more easily and largely succeeded in maintaining their
income at the same level. Comparing those in the higher and lower salary
scales Sen concludes that there has been little or no change in the
lifestyles of the former managers (Sen 1988: 69--70). This was in stark
contrast to the enormous drop in income experienced by the already
low-paid mass of workers at the bottom of the ladder in the mill
hierarchy.

In eight of the 60 households in my survey, the lack of income has
become so acute that impoverishment has given way to outright
pauperization. The members of these households can no longer afford to
buy the basic necessities to survive. But even in the households where the
fall in income has been less severe, it is still hard to make ends meet. As
a result of the gap between income and expenditure, the proportion of
the household's budget spent on food is much higher than before and
many have been forced to cut back on both the quantity and quality of
their daily food intake. The tradition of celebrating family events with
culinary specialities and lavish meals has been abandoned. According to
Sen no more than 60% of the mill workers spent 60% of
their wages on food before they were made redundant, while since the
closures, only 10% remain below this percentage. Nine-tenths are
forced to spend much more of their income on fulfilling their daily needs
(Sen 1988: 82--- ). These figures show that hardly any money is left for
the purchase of consumer durables. Although the lifestyle of the industrial
workers allowed for few comforts, the large majority of respondents
in my survey have a mains electricity and water supply, and two-thirds
have a toilet in or close to the house. A bicycle and a table or ceiling fan
are relatively normal and the majority have a radio and a sewing machine.
A little under half, yet still a relatively large percentage, still enjoy
the luxury of a television set, pressure cooker, or even a moped, purchased
in better times. But many of my informants have had to sell such
valuable possessions, and many more are no longer able to repair them if
they break down (_see also_ Masihi 1993: 43--5). A little over half (55%) of the 600 respondents in our sample own the house they live in.
The remaining 45% rent their homes for around 100 to 150
rupees per month. Although the large majority of these working class
houses are located in what now have become slum districts, this does
nothing to impair their value for those who live in them. The quality of
the dwellings has, however, suffered across the board, as the residents
find themselves unable to afford even the most basic of repairs, for
example to roofs or walls. And expenditure on housing that was formerly
well within their means --- thanks to enforcement of the Rent Control
Act under pressure of the trade union --- has now become an almost
unbearable burden. The extreme housing shortage has resulted in serious
overcrowding in most _chawls_. The congestion of too many people in too
little space is further aggravated by the lack or poor maintenance of basic
amenities such as tap water, electricity, and sewage. The slum conditions
which had deteriorated life for the inhabitants of the industrial districts
even a quarter of a century ago had been identified as a major cause for
the communal riots which broke out in 1969.

>The slums in the city are potentially explosive points of frustration, bitterness,
and anger, as was revealed in the riots in the city which were largely restricted to
these areas. (Bhatt and Chawda 1976: 706)

A greater threat to the health of the former mill workers and their
families than the deterioration in food consumption is the loss of their
right to free or cheap medical care. As mill workers, they were members
of the Employees State Insurance Scheme, set up by the government in
1948 for employees of state and private-sector companies. ESIS is
funded from contributions by employees and employers. They pay 1.75% and 3.75% of the worker's salary respectively, while the
government makes a contribution to this scheme. Under the statutes of
the scheme, the workers' families are also eligible for medical assistance
and compensation for health costs. ESIS has its own hospitals and
district clinics where its own doctors see patients and prescribe medicines.
When workers retired or were unable to work owing to disability,
the insurance cover continued for them and their wives, but those who
lost their jobs for other reasons were automatically excluded from the
scheme. To their great despair and resentment, this is what happened to
the mill workers who were made redundant as a result of the closures. I
heard the same stories as those Jani recounted in his report:

>I must continue taking medicines. ... My health has worsened. When mill was
working, I got medicines since last five years from the dispensaries of Vima
Yojana run by ESIS. After that (the closure of the mill) when I went there for
medicine, they refused to give me medicine even when my case is with that
dispensary! I had no strength to walk. When the disease became intensively
acute, I was admitted to Civil Hospital. I had to stay there for one month. In
Civil Hospital, the doctors will examine free of charge, but we have to purchase
medicines with our money. We spent ₹600 to ₹700 a month. Mortgaged the
ornaments which were kept for daughters' marriages . ... Now life has become
miserable! (Jani 1984: 18--19)

The benefit that the workers derived from their membership of ESIS was
much greater than the contribution they made to scheme, and could be
estimated as representing at least 10 to 15% of their former
monthly wage. Now that they are no longer insured they try to rely on
self-help and only call in doctors and quacks if they have no choice.
These practitioners, who are often not properly trained, charge much
more for a consultation or an injection than the insurance scheme. And
for treatment of stress and other psychic problems that arose during and
after the redundancy period there is neither the money nor the professional
expertise.

The future of the new generation of children is also in jeopardy
because their schooling is cut short. Their parents can no longer afford
the expense. Primary school attendance has not been affected but the
impact on secondary education has been much greater. I noted cases in
my fieldwork of young boys who did not finish their school year because
they were ashamed that they did not have the right outfit (clothes, books,
etc.), or because their parents were unable to pay for the compulsory
tuition. Apart from the fact that the cost of secondary education far
exceeds the household budget, the labour power of these young people is
an indispensable source of income that has to be tapped at a much earlier
age. As a consequence, their level of knowledge is often far lower than
that of the mill workers who started their working lives many years ago.

Building up reserves in case of crises is now completely out of the
question. And setbacks occur more often and with greater intensity at
the current lower lever of subsistence than before the mill closures. At
first, the workers could use their redundancy benefits, but these varied
greatly in size and many received nothing at all (see table 2.6). How was
this money used? A minority of a little over 10% managed to
deposit at least part in a savings account, and resolved not to use it until
the time came for which it was intended --- usually the marriage of sons or
daughters. A much larger group indicated that they had to use the money
to pay for medical care, urgent house repairs, or the repayment of debts.
By far the largest share was spent on day-to-day expenses since, with the
difficult transition to a lower level of income, this was the only way that
the households could meet their basic needs. Clearly this situation, in
which expense exceeded income, came to an enforced end when the
reserves had been exhausted. The fact that the redundancy payments
were far less than most workers were entitled to and were paid in
instalments over an extended period made it easier for the workers to
spend the money as it came in. Most of them clung to their previous way
of life and spending pattern far longer than was justified.

It was shown earlier that the dramatic fall in the standard of living of
the former mill workers undermined their self-confidence. They share
this with the residents of _Marienthal_, who were forced to fill their days
doing nothing. After the shock of being expelled from the mill came the
discouraging experience of looking for a new job, accompanied as it was
by the loss of skill and a much lower wage. My informants in these
households told me how the men were completely at a loss in the early
days following their dismissal. They would not talk for days on end and
refused to eat their meals. Their loss of vitality was so great that even the
lightest of physical activity was seen as too exhausting. Some stayed at
home, others left the house early in the morning and came back late at
night, refusing to disclose where they had been or what they had been
doing. This state of shock could easily lead to illness, and ailments which
had previously received little attention were used as an excuse to avoid
helping with the daily chores in the household. ESIS medical staff told
me that they had an increasing number of patients in the industrial
neighbourhoods with heart problems and high blood pressure. The
greatest demand was for social care and psychological treatment, but this
was not covered by the insurance. They treated former patients selectively
because it was no longer permitted officially. Social relationships
within the family suffered. Husbands and wives quarrelled, often leading
to violence on the part of the man, and sometimes even vice versa.
Tensions also increased between parents and children. To obtain a clearer
insight into this problem I spoke to teachers at primary and secondary
schools. They told me that children had become anxious and 'difficult',
had problems concentrating and complained about troubles at home.
The trusted routine had disappeared from the lives of these young
people. The authors of _Marienthal_ reported similar problems.

Frustration arising from a sense of social exclusion is often accompanied
by excessive alcohol abuse and the threat, if necessary, to obtain the
money required to survive by no longer behaving as a decent, lawabiding
citizen. Young men in the households of former mill workers,
who cannot find qualified and well-paid work because they have not
completed their secondary education, succumb to the temptation to
earn easy money by engaging themselves in criminal activities (Nandy _et al._ 1995: 112). In his research, Masihi also _encountered_ evidence of the
temptation to respond to the suffering resulting from injustice with
extra-legal behaviour.

>Involving in unlawful activities like distilling and selling illicit liquor, smuggling,
gambling and trafficking in narcotic drugs or indulging in drug or liquor
addiction are strategies workers adopt which affect members of their families. So
we asked them whether they or any other members of their families have started
indulging in vices like liquor or drug addiction. It was a very sensitive question
and it was obvious that many would not like to respond to such question with a
degree of honesty and sincerity. However, we did find 4 (3 males and one female)
workers admitting that they sell illicit liquor. In case of female workers, it was
found that her husband was involved in illicit distillation. Drinking country
liquor is very common among the textile workers and while collecting information,
our research investigators reported that illicit liquor was easily available in
labour areas and many textile workers were seen getting intoxicated after consuming
it. (Masihi 1993: 87)

The author rightly notes that alcohol use is a longstanding custom in the
mill-workers' milieu. In 1917, after the successful strike, Gandhi visited
the textile districts in Ahmedabad. He was told about the workers' bad
habits, especially their resistance to calls for temperance. He is reputed to
have replied that, if he had known that the money would be wasted on
strong drink, he would never have supported their wage claim. During
my visits to the workers' homes, I regularly found the men to be drunk,
both during the day and in the evenings. In that state, they were often
capable of verbal aggression and threatened to resort to violence to
obtain the justice that civilized behaviour could not bring. Having lost
their mediated access to the municipal corporation and other state
agencies as members of a powerful trade union, the former mill workers
are now dependent on slumlords for the representation of their interests.
To that extent the collapse of the textile industry has been a major cause
in the criminalization of local level politics.

Little has survived of the men's former claim to be the primary
provider for the household. After the loss of their permanent jobs and the
relatively high wages to which they were accustomed, many feel useless,
apathetic, and aggrieved. The other members of the household are
expected to show sympathy and understanding for their plight, but over
time, this has increasingly given way to irritation about the victims'
persistent complaining and inability to accept reality. The need to keep
their heads above water demands that they stop dwelling on what has
been lost and try to make the best of things. In my experience the
women, who have always been much more involved in the daily struggle
to keep the household going and who learned much earlier that they had
to look after others and not just themselves, seem much more able to
adjust to the precariousness of their new circumstances than their male
partners. It should not be forgotten that they too were affected, not so
long ago, by the redundancy that has so defeated the men. Their mass
expulsion from the mills however generated little or no commotion at
the time. This was the consequence of new attitudes that came increasingly
to the fore as the process of industrialization and urbanization
progressed. In this modern view, the basic social unit was the nuclear
family, with the man as the breadwinner, the woman as wife and mother
and the children as dependent members of the household, exempted
from labour. Jhabvala, who describes and analyses this turnaround,
makes it clear that when the rationalization in the mills demanded the
expulsion of large numbers of workers, it was the women who were
considered prime candidates for giving up their jobs, not only by the
employers, but also by the Gandhian union and the male workers. The
account of a woman who was sacked during the restructuring process,
which lasted from the 1930s to the early 1960s, illustrates the role played
by the TLA.

>I remember a big meeting of women workers --- spinners, winders, reelers, all
were there,' recalls Ratanben a spinner in the early forties. 'We all had a dinner
together and then we had _bhajans_. After that Vasavada Saheb (one of the
secretaries of the TLA) gave a speech. He said, 'Why are you women working in
the mills. You should be at home looking after the children. Your men come
home tired and you are not there to serve them. My advice to you is that you
should leave the mills.' (Jhabvala 1985: 48)

The ideology of men as the breadwinners explains why they felt ashamed
after being made redundant. Their dismissal marks them as failures, not
only in their own eyes but also in those of the 'dependent' members of
their households. The greater resilience of the women in surviving the
crisis must be understood in this light. Many of them were confronted
with the same shock some or many years previously, but they did not
experience that setback as a major problem to the same extent as the male
household members nowadays. The authors of _Marienthal_ also reported
that women not only showed more resilience in handling the crisis but
were also burdened with more tasks to keep the household going. A large
number of women in Ahmedabad continued their working life at home
or on the street without interruption. Among the latter were _Dalit_
women who collect rubbish and the _Vaghri_ women who sell fruit and
vegetables in the market or from door to door.

>Babuben is ashamed to say that she is a paper picker. When I was in the mill, we
used to look down upon the paper pickers. We would say 'we are the mill
workers, we earn a good salary. These paper pickers they wander around anywhere
without any shame. They are dirty. Today, I am degraded too. When I first
had to start picking paper, I would try to make my _ghungat_ long so no one could
see my face. I was so ashamed. How low I have fallen.' (Jhabvala 1985: 19--20)

In fact it has often been the female members of the household who have
shown the men how to find work in the informal sector of the economy.
This is true for those who work at home such as Muslim women who sew
clothes, or Padmashali women who make incense sticks. It has become
normal for the men to pick up the material from and return the finished
goods to the contractor, and receive the payment, while the women and
children take care of the actual production work. Some former mill
workers have become street vendors in various trades that were formerly
the domain of women. _Vaghri_ women do not mind men of their own
caste selling vegetables, but they do resent their tendency to dominate.
The men set up shop in the front rows, where most customers pass, put
their wares on a small table so that they are more conspicuous, or park
their handcarts so that there is little or no space left for the women.

With a wide variety of informal sector activities already being conducted
in the industrial neighbourhoods in Ahmedabad, when the mill
workers lost their jobs they were able to use their links with these
activities --- for example, their wives working at home or on the streets ---
to make the difficult downward journey to the bottom of the urban
economy. Yet, despite the difficulties of their existence, they realize that
things can always get worse. There are horror stories aplenty of the
extreme misery that has struck others: tales of desertion, divorce, and
suicide, men who are not only depressive but who have lost their minds,
former workmates who roam the streets begging for food or getting
handouts from temples or charities (_ramroti_), wives or daughter who are
forced into prostitution to earn enough to keep the households going.
The focus on these exceptional cases --- for that is what they are --- does
not come from a desire to exaggerate their intensity (_see also_ Masihi
1993: 88). I consider this tendency to talk about such excesses of
disintegration as much more symptomatic of the feelings of shame that
many people feel about their 'fall from paradise'.

So far in this analysis, the household has been the basic unit for
examining the process of impoverishment and its social consequences.
We now look at how the deterioration in the quality of life of former
textile workers has manifested itself outside and beyond the level of the
household and why the dissatisfaction that this has generated has not
been expressed in forms of collective action.

### Downward Mobility

Downward mobility was the social consequence of the loss of a permanent
job in the textile mills. One of the primary characteristics of the
lifestyle of the mass of workers in the mills was regularity. Their days were
determined by a fixed and rhythmic routine. Although the shift system
meant that this routine revolved around a day and night schedule, it was
still a regular and repetitive pattern. To allow the workers to meet all
kinds of personal obligations, there was a leave system. Their days,
weeks, and months were therefore determined by the work at the mill,
but they had become familiar with the notion of leisure which made it
possible for them to spend time 'doing nothing' or to maintain their
social contacts outside the home. The factory whistle would announce
the change of shift, but the workers would have clocks and watches to
enable them to make the distinction themselves between time spent on
a wide range of different activities. As a result of this continuity and
stability, the lives of these reasonably skilled workers were manageable
and predictable.

A second feature of this way of life was that the workers earned
enough to support themselves and the members of their households.
They could live reasonably comfortably and were by no means poor.
They had enough to eat and could afford to buy more expensive food
items to mark festive events. In addition to their working clothes, they
had better quality clothes for special occasions and the women had
jewellery. I have already mentioned that they were able to afford more
than just the everyday items of consumption. The fact that more than
half of the people I spoke to owned their own homes is an indication that
they had space on their household budgets for this investment. Naturally,
there were considerable differences in the nature and scale of
patterns of expenditure. Thrift and a tendency to save were by no means
universal. A disproportionate part of the wage could be spent on alcoholic
drink, and I would not like to suggest that all the men were
exemplary husbands and fathers who devoted their incomes entirely or
even primarily to the needs of the household.

Insurance against illness or disability also contributed to the security
and stability of the workers' lives. The contributions were not excessive
and the cover extended to the other members of their households. The
employment contract provided for a lump-sum payment on reaching
retirement age, a benefit financed on the basis of a provident fund to
which the workers themselves contributed through a savings scheme.
The level of their wages and the regularity of payment assured the
workers a high level of creditworthiness. A familiar figure in stories about
the old days is the _pathan_ who, on pay day, would be waiting for them at
the factory gate. These moneylenders demanded a large proportion of
many workers' wages as payment for debts incurred to finance their
drinking habits. The predatory practices of these loan sharks came to an
end not as the result of successful efforts to combat alcohol abuse, but as
living standards gradually improved. And for more substantial expenses --- buying
or repairing a house, the marriage of a daughter --- there was no
need to take out a high-interest loan. Union members could obtain loans
from their own cooperative bank at favourable interest rates and repayment
terms.

Membership of the union was part of the social capital of the mill
workers. The Gandhian representatives ensured that the TLA remained
loyal and followed the leaders' instructions. Defecting to another union
was considered treason and members were put under pressure to get the
deserters to return to the fold.

>There were two women in our _chali_ who left the TLA and joined the Red Flag
Union, says Ratanben. We boycotted them. One woman had to get her daughter
married but we said come back to the TLA then we will give our sons. Later, they
left Red Flag and came back to the TLA. (Jhabvala 1985: 36)

The dignity and quality of life that working in the mills permitted was
much more than just the security of allowing for a little more financial
breathing space. The capacity to build a modest reserve also expanded
the workers' social space and enabled them to view their livelihood from
long-term perspective. The decisive moment was when they were given
a permanent employment contract. One informant told me that, on the
evening of the day on which he heard that he no longer had to work as
a _badli_, the parents of the woman who is now his wife came to make him
a proposal of marriage. The security of a job 'for life', and the high wages
and wide range of rights that it brought with it, encouraged investment
in the future. The education of children was given a higher priority than
before, as was the arrangement of marriages that would enhance the
family's standing in the community. The status of mill worker gave those
who were previously nameless a much clearer social visibility and an
identity.

>We were having no address earlier and we did not belong to any place ...
Factory's job not only gave us stable life but we could have official document such
as ration-card and our names were enlisted in voters' list ... (Desai 2001: 9)[^13/4]

A final factor that contributed strongly to the workers' feelings of selfrespect
was the awareness that they were members of a social class that
defended its collective interests in an organized manner. This collective
action was manifested in and through the actions of a trade union of
which the large majority were members. To be sure, the members had
little say in what the union leadership decided on their behalf. From a
relatively early stage, a minority resisted this authoritarian style of
leadership, which tolerated no input from the workfloor, and chose a
course of more militant action to try and improve their lot both within
and beyond the mill walls. The memories of the struggle to end these
abuses remain strong in the industrial districts.

>One _pathan jamadar_ collected the rent in our _chawl_. I fail to recall his name, but
he was the toughest of all _jamadars_ in our area. He never spoke decently and was
very rude while collecting the rent. What insulting life the _Dalits_ and workers
lived at that time! No one dared open his mouth in front of this _pathan jamadar_.
He manhandled anybody without regret. People were frightened by him. _Dalits_
could not enter hotels for a cup of tea, but they could sit outside and have the cup
of tea which they were made to wash afterwards. Even in the mill canteen they sat
outside while upper caste workers sat inside the canteen. The Throstle Department
was created for the untouchables. There were separate drinking water tanks
and resting places for upper castes and _Dalits_. Untouchability was rampant,
though all were workers of the mills but upper castes considered themselves as
higher up. The workers had no unity on social grounds. The feeling that all the
workers are victims of exploitation could not be generated due to casteism. The
_goondas_ harassed, lone women going out were not safe, theft was rampant,
moneylenders had their den at the mill gates. _Pathans_ grabbed the money on the
payday from his debtors, whose habit of drinking forced them to take loans from
_pathans_. Gambling was not very common among workers but they became
destitute because of the drinking habit. Masters in the mill (Note: these were the
workfloor managers) used to beat ardently. (Parmar 1989:9--10)

[^13/4]: This quotation comes from Kiran Desai's report on his study of sacked textile
workers in South Gujarat.


Despite later dissatisfaction with the TLA because, as a trade union in
the Gandhian tradition, it offered little resistance to the dismantling of
the large-scale textile industry and failed to defend the rights of its
members at the time of closure, the organization did take an early stand
to combat discrimination against the _Dalits_. Without condemning the
caste system as such, the union leadership tried to tackle its excesses
through campaigns of social reform. Nevertheless, the discrimination
against members of the untouchable castes continued within the factory
walls and was a source of conflict within the union itself.

>Kankuben describes the 1940s: When I was young we openly used to be called
>bad names like '_dhed_ by the higher castes. We always had to eat separately and
>they tried to avoid touching us. When we went to meetings in TLA, the _patels_
>and other high castes would sit far from us. Whenever TLA organised a feast the
>high castes refused to join if we were there. Some _patels_ also left TLA because of
>us. (Jhabvala 1985: 34; _see also_ Parmar 1989)
>
>The _Dalits_ still appreciate the way in which the TLA fought for their social
>emancipation. Kankuben summed up their sentiments with these words: 'Our
>caste has come up because of TLA.' (Jhabvala 1985: 34)

Conversely, I would like to argue that, in the habitat of industrial labour
that had emerged and against the background of the need to mobilize the
necessary political support for the struggle for national independence,
the Gandhian ideology had no other choice than to submit to the
demand from the urbanized mass for a minimum social respectability.
Although this mobilization occurred among the lower levels of the urban
industrial order, there was no similar trend in the countryside. That
explains why the oppression of landless labourers --- a far greater mass in
the rural economy --- received little or no attention from Mahatma Gandhi
and most of his followers in the Congress economy (see Breman 1974).
The political awareness of the urban-industrial workers was raised through
the spread of more radical ideas which challenged the longstanding
hegemonic alliance between the TLA and the Congress Party.
Ramachandra Parmar, a socialist labour activist who supported Ambedkar's
ideas, propagated them in the industrial districts and instructed groups
of young boys in physical exercise and wrestling, activities signalling
social and political assertion. It would be inaccurate to suggest that the
majority of textile workers were as politically aware and active as this
champion of radical ideas, who in later years became one of the founders
of the _Dalit_ Panther movement in Gujarat. But from his autobiography
it is clear that the political mobilization was under way in the urban
industrial districts (Parmar 1989). _AmSeb_ (Ambedkar Saheb) was the
name used for supporters of the militant _Dalit_ consciousness in this
milieu. In contrast to this emancipatory dynamic, it is striking that the
subaltern classes in the countryside of Gujarat largely fell outside the
sphere of activity of the leftist social movements as did --- though to a
lesser extent --- the mass of informal sector workers in the cities.

This portrait of a proletarian vanguard with an urban industrial
signature, as described above, should be properly contextualized in both
time and place. During the final decades of the twentieth century, the
workers in the cotton mills not only lost their favourable position in
terms of pay, compared to wage levels in other branches of industry
within the formal sector, but started to fall behind (_see also_ Howell and
Kambhampati 1997: 24). This relative deterioration was an early precursor
to the crisis which gathered momentum from the early 1980s. The
occupational diseases that part of the workforce suffered from also
contradicted the image of good employment conditions. The dust from
the raw cotton meant that many workers, especially those in the initial
stages of production, developed lung diseases, which led in many cases to
disability to work and premature death. The toxic fumes and the acids
which had to be handled without proper protection in the dyeing
department also led to failing health. In spite of these factors, there is no
doubt that the working people employed in the corporate textile mills
had improved their living standards, on the basis of the rights they and
preceding generations had acquired --- permanent, skilled work, relatively
high wages, the comfort of leisure, insurance against illness and
other risks, the capacity to accumulate financial reserves, access to cheap
loans, and lastly, the possibility to defend their interests through collective
action and the political awareness that comes with it. All this came
to an abrupt end when they were expelled from employment in the
formal sector. In all the respects mentioned, the loss of permanent jobs
marked a reversal of the long process of increase in social standing to one
of progressive exclusion. Not all the dismissed workers were affected
uniformly. As we have seen earlier, those who had worked in technical
and administrative positions --- less than 10% of the total
workforce --- had fewer problems finding new employment and suffered
a less dramatic fall in income. But the labourers themselves were also
affected by the process of exclusion to varying degrees. The differences
that already existed between them on the workfloor persisted in the work
they found outside the mills and the wages they earned from it. The
_Patels_, who as weavers were already in a somewhat better position, found
work in small-scale industrial businesses, like weaving shops and diamond
ateliers. They earn much less nowadays than they had in the mills
and most only work 15 to 20 days a month. Yet their expulsion from the
regular lifestyle of the mills was less dramatic than that of the much larger
group of former colleagues from the lower castes or from religious
minorities. _Dalits_ and Muslims were particularly affected by prevailing
forms of discrimination in their efforts to find new work. They appear to
have been the last to be considered for regular or reasonably well-paid
work, whether it was in small or larger companies. Spodek reports on one
case of communal exclusion.

>During July 1986, newspapers reported that a riot erupted when a Muslim tried
to pass as a Hindu in order to get a job at Reliance Industries --- Ahmedabad's
fastest growing new synthetic plant. Accused of attempted sabotage, the Muslim
was severely beaten by the mill workers. My question to officials in Reliance was:
'Why does a Muslim have to pretend to be a Hindu to get a job at Reliance?'. The
unofficial answer was that Reliance hires very few Muslims. (Spodek 1989: 782)

As wage hunters and gatherers were forced to seek work in the informal
sector, the former mill workers not only saw their incomes fall dramatically
to half or even less than what they used to earn, they also lost the
certainty that they would actually be paid even this paltry amount. Their
work no longer requires any skill and I regard the stories former mill
workers told me about the machines --- the way their bodies shook with
the vibrations --- less as nostalgia for what they miss than a complaint that
their work no longer has any value. The shame that comes from this
realization is expressed in compassion for others in the same situation: 'I
was hurt to see one of my superiors taking a kettle and selling tea on the
road.' (Noronha 1999: 103)

Free time is a luxury that can no longer be enjoyed. Days, weeks, and
months are spent trying to earn enough money to survive and time that
is not devoted to that is not leisure time but unemployed time. The
propensity to save --- building up a reserve to be used when the occasion
arises --- is a thing of the past and, instead, debts have to be incurred to
cover even everyday expenses. And the uncertainty of this existence has
resulted in a loss of creditworthiness. Expulsion from the union meant
that the sacked workers no longer had access to cooperative credit from
their own bank. The greatest risk for former mill workers seeking loans
is that moneylenders tend to demand extortionate interest rates, ranging
from 50 to 250% a year (Sen 1988: 86). A concrete example is
provided by this account from a street vendor of sugarcane juice.

>Ultimately, he decided to go for self-employment. But for this, from where was
he to get money? He was ready to pay interest of ₹15 for ₹100 per month.
Then even, who will lend money to a jobless worker? Now-a-days, _Pathans_ also
do not lend money if they do not have a mill-card. At least, he hired this machine
at the rate of ₹7 per day. And he mortgaged an ornament of his wife to the
goldsmith and got ₹200 at the rate of 4% interest (note: per month). He
bought these four bamboos and the rags which is spread over the bamboos --- and
these 4--6 glasses! He started this work since one week. Let us see, how it works.
(Jani 1984: 6--7)

The daily struggle to survive demands so much alertness and energy that
there is no material or mental room left to invest in the future. If children
do go to school, they usually have to leave after completing their primary
education, a level which is far too low to give them a favourable start in
the labour market. One of my informants told me that he decided to
withdraw his daughter from school when he heard that she had to pay
extra money for computer training. He was fully aware that this decision
would diminish her future prospects and felt extremely despondent
about it. The former mill workers also worry a great deal about their
children's marriage partners and the costs of these arrangements. Looking
for suitable candidates is time-consuming and assumes that the
parents have the opportunity to deliberate carefully on their choice.
Financial considerations play a decisive role in the negotiations, which
aim to secure the best candidate at the lowest price. In the absence of a
reasonable dowry, girls in particular are forced to accept partners who
would never have been eligible before. A lower status, not only for the
individual but for the whole family, is the price that has to be paid (_see also_ Masihi 1993: 86).

Lastly, the workers' interests are no longer defended through collective
action. Expulsion from the union means that former mill workers
have to negotiate their terms of employment themselves and no longer
belong to a class which was accustomed to articulating its demands in an
organized manner. On the contrary, negotiations with employers now
demand reticence or even a show of deference so as not to ruin the
chance of this ad hoc and temporary work with an excessive show of
assertiveness. Two informants told me, independently of each other, that
their reputations as former union activists have been a considerable
hindrance in finding work. Employers send them away as soon as they
hear of their past activities. In the difficult struggle to keep one's head
above water, those in the same situation are not natural allies but more
often competitors, with whom it is not possible to reach agreement on
the distribution of scarce goods. While selling drinking water, we have
to fight like dogs to attract customers.' (Noronha 1999: 104). Organized
activities, even to pursue political aspirations, are no longer within the
reach of the former mill workers. Their attention has been narrowed to
the immediate concern of taking care of themselves and the members of
their households. In this scenario, there is no room for broad social
engagement or a long-term perspective. Instead there is a need for them
to compete for the scarce resources to which they have access. The fight
for survival has made them vulnerable to political forces eager to divide
them along communal lines.

### The Communalization of Politics

Instead of a habitus based on awareness of being part of a working mass
and expressing that bond of solidarity in an institutional manner, the
identification of the former mill workers rarely extends beyond narrow
primordial loyalties along the lines of caste and religion. I have pointed
out earlier that the restricted social formations that are central to the field
of interaction were also the primary reference frameworks for group
behaviour in the former working and living circumstances. But then
these forms of segmentation were transcended by more comprehensive
collective ties, such as trade union or political party. Now, those broader
forms of association are beyond the vision of the former mill workers or
have lost much of their significance.

The popular opinion that the working class presented a close-knit and
unified bloc against the employers is completely at odds with the
orthodox hierarchy of pure' and impure' between people who occupied
similar positions on the workfloor. Although the Gandhian union bosses
did not criticize the caste system itself they condemned the discrimination
that it gave rise to.

>The leaders, Nandaji (Gulzarilal Nanda), Vasavda _Sahib_ (Shyad Prasad Vasavda)
and Khandubhai (Khandubhai Desai) would always sit and eat with us', continues
Kankuben. 'They organised meetings and told all the workers that untouchability
was wrong. They said that union strength means worker unity and among
workers no one was high or low. Every six months or so we would have common
prayers and common meals. Today, high castes, low castes we all sit together and
it is because of TLA. (Jhabvala 1985: 35)

Despite incessant calls for equality and solidarity there were clear
fractures in the attempts to form a joint workers' front. The containment
of class based politics by TLA and Congress in tandem sharpened caste
and religious loyalties. In 1969, communal riots broke out in Ahmedabad
which cost 1,500 lives, 90% of them Muslims (Shah 1970). In the
industrial districts, in particular, workers of different identities clashed
violently and hundreds died. A report by a judge who was commissioned
by the government to lead an investigation into the riots stated that in
Amraiwadi, a hundred Muslim textile workers were murdered (Reddy
Commission 1969: 173; _see also_ Shah 1977: 15--16). When I asked
informants about this disunity they denied its existence within the mill
walls. Had they been able to talk about what had happened? Yes, they
told me, and they insisted that the riots had been incited by unidentified
outsiders. They added with pride that the curfew that the authorities had
imposed did not apply to them. Their factory passes were enough to get
them past the patrols because the night shifts continued uninterrupted.
Jivan Thakore, one of the few who has written about his life history as a
mill worker, gives a vivid description of the close relationships that used
to exist and which prevented communal clashes among the workforce.

>Even during strict curfew they ensured the running of the mills in their area.
Hindu and Muslim friends met and discussed what was happening in their
respective localities. So, rumours surfaced but soon evaporated without spreading
further. The majority of workers lived close to the mills and not only they
refrained themselves but also saw to it that their family members did not
participate in the violence. If due to such involvement they got hit by tear gas
shell or stones or were injured in any other way, they would be humiliated the
next day by co-workers. There existed such a sense of fright in them. Moreover,
daily routine of chitchatting over tea and snacks had cultivated comradeship
amongs Hindu-Muslims. Also, fear of being branded as communalantisocial
element prevailed in all. Consequently, Hindu and Muslim workers had distanced
themselves from such activities and thwarted all such attempts by their
near-relatives. ... Although the mill would function, the outside world had many
incidents of violence. The noise and clamour would tear us away from work and
we would climb on trees and compounds to see instances of stone throwing and
looting. And Muslims would boast about the hotheaded Ashgar (who used the
_lathi_ with great skill) or the sword-carrying Aalam, while we would talk about the
indomitable Keshla (an expert at swinging the dagger). The mill guards would
fidget when they heard such comments and rush to their bosses! We would
promptly be asked to get down the walls and trees. The supervisors and _jamadars_
feared that the outrage outside may creep into the mill and its premises. But we
had communal harmony inside the compound. In fact, we would advise each
other on strategies of safety --- the routes people could use for going home or
coming in especially during intense trouble. In this way, though surrounded by
flames of communalism, we shared feelings of brotherhood. We helped Muslim
co-workers in getting what they wanted and would not mind bringing it for
them to the mill. The chairman of the mill's credit society, Sirajul Yasin, was my
good friend. He smoked _bidis_ while in the mill but used _hukka_ at home (at
Garibnagar, near Ajit Mill's _chawl_). I procured for him the special tobacco
needed in _hukka_ from _gaduka_ shopkeeper, who opened his shop after quite a bit
of persuasion. Muslims would get mutton and eggs for those Hindu's who were
fond of non-veg. (Jivan Thakore 2002)

There was a new wave of unrest when, in 1981--2 and 1985--6, the
higher castes in the city protested at the positive discrimination from
which _Dalits_ and other backward castes (OBCs) especially benefited.
The violence erupted after a political coalition was forged which gave the
lower castes and minorities the power in the state of Gujarat, at the
expense of a configuration in which the middle and higher castes were
accustomed to holding the reins (Patel 1986; Spodek 1989). The anti-reservation
campaign of civil disobedience protested at an official policy
that tried to put a stop to the social and economic deprivation from
which members of low castes suffered by facilitating their access to
education, government grants, and employment, especially in the public
sector. This state-imposed positive discrimination was tolerated as long
as it was restricted to creating somewhat more space at the base of society.
But the more these denigrated segments belonging to the bottom of the
caste hierarchy slowly managed to penetrate to positions that were
traditionally the prerogative of members of the middle and higher castes,
the greater the resistance to their aspirations. The riots that broke out in
the city in 1985 were a response to a decision to extend the reservation.
quota to other backward castes, such as _Vaghris_, who had also been left
behind in the process of social development. What had started as a
middle-class protest against the preferential treatment of the lower castes
by the government evolved into a clash between the religious majority
and minority. Hindu organizations called for a large-scale procession
through the old city of Ahmedabad in which _Dalits_ were also now
allowed to participate.

>Some of the _Rath Yatra_ processionists were armed with _lathis_, _trishuls_ and other
weapons. There were more than one hundred thousand people in the procession.
Communal forces, led by the _Sangh Parivar_, were bent on creating trouble. As
the procession entered the Muslim areas, a section of the processionsists shouted
anti-Muslim slogans to infuriate the Muslims. In the Muslim lanes, they started
pelting stones and attacked the Muslims. A major riot broke out once again.
(D'Costa 2002: 365)

Heeding a call by the Hindu Raksha Samiti (Hindu Defence Committee)
to bring the economic life of the city to a standstill, all the textile
mills closed their gates. Remarkably, the decision was supported by the
TLA. In doing so, the union gave a clear signal that it supported a
movement that rejected the ruling Congress Party and was preparing the
ground for a takeover of political power by the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP).

In the preceding decades, the _Dalits_ in particular had taken advantage
of the government support to throw off the yoke of denigration. The
income from their work in the cotton mills made it much easier for them
to send their children to primary and secondary school at a time when
other deprived groups did not yet feel the necessity to do so. Their self-confidence
and self-respect increased when the younger generation qualified
for training and jobs that had previously been far beyond their reach.
_Dalit_ informants proudly told me of high-ranking civil servants from
their neighbourhood whose parents had made it possible for them to
obtain a more advanced education and who had subsequently acquired
employment at a level at which no one from their caste had ever before
reached. The encouragement of the Gandhian movement during this
journey upward had been invaluable, but the mixed feelings among the
target group about the support they received in their struggle for
emancipation were equally understandable. The Temple Entry Movement
launched by the _Dalits_ in 1948 had failed because Congress
leaders, Sardar Vallabhbhai in particular, were eager to de-escalate the
_satyagraha_. The reluctance of TLA leaders to commit themselves to the
programme of positive discrimination when the anti-reservation protests
came to a climax in the early 1980s remains fresh in subaltern memory.
Although this public policy aimed at the gradual improvement of the lot
of the lower castes (_Dalits_ and OBCs) was of indispensable significance,
the TLA avoided adopting a strong line of action for or against in this
sensitive issue. My informants in the _Dalit_ milieu tended to attribute this
evasive attitude to the high-caste identity of the union bosses. This,
however, takes no account of the pressure applied on the leadership by
that part of the rank and file hailing from the middle and higher castes,
who were resolutely opposed to the politics of reservation.

Acceptance of the caste system as a principle of social organization
was founded on Gandhi's teaching and had been the reason why the
TLA had, from its inception, united its members on the assumption that
they retained their own identity. As the opportunities decreased within
the political and economic order to satisfy aspirations that had grown
across the board since Independence, the conflicts that arose over the
distribution of power, welfare, and status continued within the factory
walls. In its attempts to contain this conflict the TLA, through its
ideological standpoint, failed to give priority to upgrading the subordinate
classes in mainstream society. Feelings towards the TLA, especially
among the _Dalits_, who remained the largest group among the union's
membership until its downfall, are not entirely determined by gratitude
for what had been achieved. Now that the righteous struggle has been
fought, they are embittered about their exclusion from a labour system
that may have given them a powerful push forward, but which has been
rapidly dismantled, as a consequence of which their circumstances are
now much worse. According to my _Dalit_ informants, it is no coincidence
that they were expelled from the mills just when the younger
generation, with their greater assertiveness, had just started to qualify for
the kind of jobs that offered greater prosperity and status. According to
them, those who traditionally held the reins became even more resolute
in their strategy of exclusion and met claims from below with a relentless
regime of oppression. It is not difficult to understand why, as per this
conspiracy theory, the closure of large-scale textile companies and the
mass redundancies are seen as a setback in the onerous process of
emancipation.

This applies even more to the Muslims. In the past, they constituted
a larger part of the mill workforce. The gradual but progressive replacement
of members of this minority, mostly by _Patels_, continued almost
unnoticed from the middle of the last century. I have referred earlier to
the study of Sujata Patel discussing the background to the riots in
Ahmedabad in 1985 and 1986. Even at that stage, pamphlets were being
distributed calling for an economic boycott and even the physical destruction
of Muslims.

>You should not buy any material from their shops. The rupee paid by us is used
in destroying our Hindu religion. All those who sit on the pavement from the
fountain on Gandhi Road to Bhadra are Muslims. All the shopkeepers are
Muslims. They have arranged to murder Hindus or create arson and theft. To sit
in an auto driven by Muslims is to sit in the car of the God of death. They are
traitors and untrustworthy people. They have raped several Hindu girls. Will you
forget these oppressions on your mothers and sisters? These people have murdered
two of our _Harijans_ in Gomatipur and have raped and killed one _Harijan_
girl in Mirzapur. Come, Hindu, _Harijan_, Sikh, Marathi, Panjabi, let us forget all
caste and class distinctions and face the challenge of these bigots and traitors.
Come, let us take a pledge that 'we all Hindus are one'. (Patel 1986: 146--7)

In her report, Patel focuses on the trend towards excluding Muslims from
working in the textile mills in the post-colonial era. Leaders from this
minority group, with whom I spoke towards the end of the century
about the communal recruitment policy of the large-scale industrial
employers, admitted that they had been aware of this bias but had not
protested for fear of fuelling the growing antagonism among the Hindu
majority. In the first chapter I referred to a strike that had broken out in
a mill in 1878 to demand the dismissal of a worker who had passed
himself off as a _Marwari_, while he was in fact a _Dhed_. It is indicative of
the changing trend in the social fabric that, a century later, the call for
communal exclusion was based not on caste but on religion. This is
illustrated by the case of a Muslim worker who was instantly expelled
from a mill for pretending he was a Hindu.

What started as a middle class campaign against the reservation policy
favouring backward castes increasingly turned into a conflict between
Hindus and Muslims. The clashes between them went on for several
months. The 1985 riots in Ahmedabad were the outcome of the changed
strategy of the BJP which now decided to mobilize rather than antagonizse
the subaltern castes. The high caste leaders of this party realized that only
by broadening their mass base could they succeed in taking over power
at the municipal and state level. The target of confrontation had to be
refocused exclusively on the Muslim minority. The student wing of the
BJP orchestrated the agitation. _Goondas_ were hired to do the dirty work
of stabbing and killing and the police force was strongly biased against
the victims.[^13/5] Of course, the shift in political alignments did not happen
overnight but went back to ruptures in the social fabric which could be
discerned much earlier. The Hindutva assertion towards the end of the
twentieth century, pushed so brutally by the _Sangh Parivar_, had its
antecedents in the political climate fostered by the Congress on the eve
of Independence. Vallabhbhai Patel, born and bred from well-established
peasant stock and the most authoritarian among the top leaders,
did not mince words in questioning the loyalty of Muslims to the
country in which they continued to live. Well-known for his anti-leftist
sentiments and without hiding his lack of empathy with the plight of
subordinated segments which belonged to the Hindu majority, the
_Sardar_ of Gujarat came close to accusing the religious minority of
betraying the national interest. On the basis of statements made by him
in 1947 Parita Mukta argues that:

> ... he took for granted the loyalty of 'Hindu' citizens while singling out Muslim
citizens permanently living under a mark of suspicion _unless they demonstrated to
the contrary_. Here then, the only loyal Muslim was one who became a soldier in
defence of the integrity of the Indian State. (Mukta 2002: 70)

His bigoted ideas on the theme of citizenship can be traced in the agenda
drawn up by the BJP and its front organizations. Patel's praise for the
Arya Samaj for bringing back to the 'Hindu fold those who had been
forcibly converted to other faiths' is another example of his biased stance
which half a century later Hindu fundamentalists in the state of Gujarat
are happy to echo with even more zeal. Vallabhbhai Patel's caste identity
would not have brought him political popularity in Gujarat if he had
failed to articulate the economic and cultural aspirations of his milieu.
Building up Narendra Modi as _chhote Sardar_ (the little Lion) demonstrates
how past and present are connected in the public mind. In the latest
pogrom which took place in 2002 the _Patels_ boasted about their shared
genealogy with the man they consider the one and only national hero,
and having succeeded in their claim for _savarna_ status, are reported to
have driven out Muslim families from several villages in the region of his
birth.

[^13/5]: Without going into details, I refer to the official investigations conducted by a
commission of enquiry on the communal twist given to what were initially clashes
between proponents and opponents of reservation (Dave 1990).


Inspired by a completely different desire for emancipation than the
one that dominates at the base of society in the city, the upwardly mobile
castes try to gain political clout and social respectability by supporting
the _Ram Raj_ programme --- the BJP and its front organizations' path to an
orthodox-fundamentalist future --- under the tutelage of leaders who
largely come from the high castes. The resounding success of this
mobilization led the BJP gain power in the city council in 1987 and
shortly afterwards, in the state assembly as well. This success was the
result of the BJP turning all existing communal tensions into election
issues and discrediting Congress politicians for allegedly discriminating
against the Hindu majority in favour of the non-Hindu minority. The
aggression against the Muslim population in the city reached a zenith at
the end of 1992 and the beginning of 1993 when, in response to the
destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya, the BJP government of Gujarat
seemed more concerned to encourage than to stop the fight against the
enemy in our midst'.[^13/6] Even before the persecution of Muslims had
reached its peak in the city, several incidents had already taken place in
the textile neighbourhoods. Muslims and _Dalits_ shot at each other with
home-made weapons and bombarded the other side with projectiles
filled with petrol or acid. Researchers from non-governmental organizations
who were observing and reporting on the communal unrest received
unusual requests for assistance.

>A _Dalit_ textile worker staying in a Gomtipur slum, close to a large Muslim
settlement, thought that we were from the VHP and said: 'Sir, only milk and
medicine will not do, give us guns and teach us how to use them.' (Nandy _et al._
1995: 121).

[^13/6]: For details of these events, see the report on my fieldwork at the time (Breman 2002,
chs. 10 and 11).

This example shows that members of the lowest castes also proved
responsive to the appeal to unite under the Hindu banner and distance
themselves from the Muslims, even though the latter had helped the
lower castes in earlier conflicts with the higher castes. Where in the past
the so-called unclean castes were not tolerated in the vicinity of the
higher castes, slowly but surely a pattern of division along religious lines
began to evolve. During my fieldwork I came across streets in the
industrial districts where one side was populated by members of the
majority group and the other by the minority. This segregation had been
achieved with such a large number of enforced evictions that the city
council, when it was still dominated by Congress, felt obliged to pass an
emergency regulation --- The Prohibition of Transfer of Immovable Property
and Provision for Protection of Tenants from Eviction from the
Premises in Disturbed Areas Act 1986--- to put a stop to it (Khan 2000).
The measure was a failure and the Ayodhya riots at the end of 1992 and
the beginning of 1993 culminated in a new round of expulsions of
Muslims and their internment in ghettos (Breman 2002, ch. 10).

Among the mill workers, it was the _Kanbi Patels_/_Patidars_ who --- as an
upwardly mobile intermediate caste --- were most receptive to the fundamentalist
propaganda. Many of them had no trouble at all in abandoning
their former colleagues in a social and political sense and giving their
wholehearted support to the BJP's agenda. Conversely, the Congress
Party's refusal to devote serious attention to the issue of mass unemployment
following the closure of the textile mills caused many former
workers to desert the party for which the majority of them had traditionally
voted. This completed their political demobilization. Regarding its
consequences, Chowdhury has the following to say:

> ... the loss of the eastern Ahmedabad constituencies, erstwhile Congress (I)
strongholds, may be a reflection of the political fallouts of the failure to balance
industrial restructuring with some kind of social security. This fact possibly
needs further examination; long term and systematic absence of attention to the
negative impact of market forces on weaker sections of the population can in fact
lead to loss of power, and consequently to a loss of momentum in the economic
liberalisation thrust. (Chowdhury 1996: L/13)

Certainly, the elections for the city council in the autumn of 2000 ended
in a temporary defeat for the BJP. The shift seems to have been caused by
a growing dissatisfaction among the lower castes with the party's Hindutva
course, but it should certainly not be seen as a sign of restored confidence
in the pro-poor agenda of the Congress Party. The elections held in
December 2002 have brought the BJP back in power in the state and in
Ahmedabad with a larger majority than ever before.

In addition to the loss of political credibility I would like to point to
the dangers of a progressive erosion of the foundations of civil society by
the mobilization of a political majority in such a way as to exclude a
minority (Khare 1998; Shah 1998). The criminalization of politics and
the corruption of public authority have assumed disturbing proportions
and undermine not only the constitutional state, but also the democratic
fabric of society as a whole. At the end of a long list of illegal sources of
income --- distilling and selling strong drink, the smuggling of drugs and
weapons, fraud and bribery in the land development and construction
sectors,[^13/7] the falsification of documents and tax evasion --- Spodek identifies
a serious erosion of public authority and order in the city (Spodek
2000: 12). Because the government can do nothing to bring this extralegal
situation under control --- bureaucrats and politicians are in fact
party to its expansion --- people take their own steps to secure their
private property and safety. Private companies are set up to provide
security. In this respect it is interesting to note that as many as 44 of the
600 sacked mill workers I interviewed stated _chowkidar_ (security guard)
as their new profession.

In an earlier part of this account I referred to the fact that industrial
workers who have been forced to seek new forms of income on the street
or in other low-quality work in the informal sector in the daily struggle
to survive, fall back on the only identity that they still have --- membership
of a caste or religious community. The shift in the balance of
political power has intensified the pattern of segregation in work and in
the living environment. As far as the modalities of employment are
concerned, this divergent trend has already been pointed out. In the
residential areas too, a process of segregation is going on between the
Hindu majority and the Muslim minority that leads to a progressive
escalation of antagonism, with an accompanying reinforcement of the
image of the other as the enemy, than to peaceful coexistence and
adherence to the democratic norm to include fully in mainstream society
those who are 'different'. It would not be incorrect to suggest that there
is a direct causal relationship between the massive expulsion of labour
from the formal sector of the city economy and the eruption of communal
violence at the end of the twentieth century. As we have seen, such
riots also occurred earlier in the century, when Ahmedabad was proud to
call itself the Manchester of India. Yet one cannot underestimate the
significance of the fact that divisions along lines of caste and religion
were transcended by a large variety of social contacts in and around the
textile mills. In that sense, the dismantling of the cotton industry, and
the mass expulsion of labour on which large-scale industrial production
depended, has led to a much greater loss than jobs alone. In my
assessment the political promotion of communal identities is, inadvertently
or consciously, meant to defuse the threat of a unified mass of
labouring poor made vulnerable and volatile as 'the dangerous class' at
the bottom of the urban economy. I shall return to this conclusion in the
final chapter.

[^13/7]: As a result of the earthquake in Ahmedabad in mid January 2001, many hundreds of
people were killed when houses and other buildings collapsed. Their deaths were the direct
result of large-scale violation of building regulations. The disaster led to the arrest of
several building entrepreneurs and shed at least a little light on the fraudulent practices
that characterized their dealings with bureaucrats and politicians. The building sector was
not the only sector of the city's economy in which criminal practices were rife, but it was
one of the most critical cases.
