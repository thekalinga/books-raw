## The 'Righteous Struggle' Reconsidered

### Labour in the Textile Mills on the eve of the Closures

The crisis that started in the textile industry in the early 1960s gathered
momentum two decades later. By the end of the twentieth century, more
than 50 mills had closed their gates and dismissed their workers. The
second part of this study examines the collapse of the textile industry
and, in particular, the impact of the closures on the lives of the former
mill workers. In this chapter, I conclude the first part by looking in
greater detail at some of the changes that occurred in the lives of the
workers during the first three-quarters of the twentieth century. In
addition to the historical sources already mentioned, I also make use of
a number of publications based on contemporary research. Two of these
report on the activities of the trade unions during the second half of the
1970s and on what their members thought of the way in which the
union leaders represented their interests (Sharma 1980; Masihi 1985[^/8/1]).

Sharma's report deals exclusively with the TLA, and the emphasis on
Masihi's study is on the relationship between the leadership and members
of this union. This is understandable, given that the large majority
of the workers traditionally belonged to the TLA. The Gandhian union
retained its federal structure throughout its history. It consisted of 12
occupational groups, each with their own representatives (one per 50--75
workers) on the Joint Board of Representatives. The 12 constituent
unions were as follows:

[^/8/1]: This study was published in 1985 but it was based on empirical research conducted
ten years previously (Masihi 1985: 39).

1. The Card, Blow, Comber and Frame Workers' Union;
2. The Throstle Workers' Union;
3. The Reelers' Union;
4. The Winders' Union;
5. The Warpers, Sizers, Nakshi and Drawing-in Workers' Union;
6. The Weaver Workers' Union;
7. The Grey-Folding, Bleaching, Folding, Stamping and
   Press-Workers' Union;
8. The Dyeing, Bleaching, Calendering, Finishing, Printing and
Processing Workers' Union;
9. The Jobber and Mukadam's Union;
10. The Clerks' Union;
11. The Engine Mechanic, Power Plant and Electric Department
    Workers' Union;
12. The Paherawala (Watchmen), Canteen Employees and General
    Workers' Union.

Of the total number of _pratinidhis_ (representatives) who sat on the Joint
Board for a term of three years, 115 were delegated to the Central
Executive Committee on the basis of the numerical strength of the
subsidiary unions. The Central Committee also had a group of 28
honorary members, who operated entirely independently of the rank
and file. The same applied to the eminent nominees of the Advisory
Committee. This hierarchical form of representation, together with the
fact that the President and Secretaries were appointed by cooptation and
for an unlimited period, resulted in an organizational framework which
was strongly oligarchic.

The top-down style of leadership was of course founded on Gandhian
ideology, which believed that workers had to be shown the way to a
better future through paternalistic counselling. The patrons of the poor
were committed to improving the lot of the masses but did not for a
minute consider transferring responsibility for drafting and implementing
the union's agenda to the members, or even sharing that responsibility
with them. The task of setting a course for the union could not
possibly be entrusted to people who had proved time and again that they
lacked the moral and mental fibre to improve their lives themselves.
Gandhi himself had expressed these sentiments in as many words.

> ... moral and social reforms amongst labourers is most difficult and taxing. It is
slow work and can be done only at the hands of reformers who will live
practically among their midst and by their sterling character affect the lives of
mill hands for the better. (Young India 24--9-1925: 331)

This conviction not only prevailed at the start of the righteous struggle
but was maintained right to the bitter end. What the Gandhian reformers
neglected to do, in spite of their dedication to the cause and the
humble way in which they themselves lived, was to share the conditions
under which the workers had to survive. Their social reform mission
remained a matter of remote control. They were the workers' friends, but
at arm's length. They were friends who combined their good intentions
with an emphasis on a whole range of shortcomings from which the
workers had to free themselves _en route_ to civilizing their behaviour.
When would the reforms be completed? The moment at which the rank
and file were considered sufficiently developed and vocal to take over the
reins never seemed to come any closer. Paternalism was no temporary
inconvenience but was grounded in an authoritarian stance that was
beyond discussion.

In response to pertinent questions by Sharma on the lack of participation
in decision-making, three-quarters of his respondents indicated that
they would prefer elected office bearers to those appointed for them. The
latter defended the existing system by arguing that having non-elected
officials was in line with Gandhi's intention that decisions should not be
taken under political pressure. They claimed that holding on to this
principle was not against, but precisely in, the best interests of the
members. As far as they were concerned they were prepared to give up
their positions at any time. They were certain, however, that the workers
would resolutely oppose their resignations (Sharma 1980: 127). This
strategy of praising their own standpoint humbly but resolutely is wellknown
among social workers of a Gandhian persuasion. From their
point of view any talk of autocratic or even paternalistic leadership is
completely misplaced.

When asked about the essence of the trade union's strategy of settling
disputes in consultation with the mill owners, almost two-thirds of the
respondents said they did not disagree with it. They insisted, however,
that the two parties had different, diametrically opposed interests (Masihi
1985: 185). The majority of TLA members also rejected Gandhi's
statement that employers and employees all belong to the same family.
The union members interviewed by Sharma responded even more
critically. Only half agreed with the statement that the TLA represented
its members' interests, with the other half describing the union as 'promill'.
When asked for more details, they accused the union officials of
cooking up every agreement with the employers, without ever consulting
the members. The latter were always presented with the results and were
only able at that late stage to make marginal changes.

>One of the office-bearers agreed that the TLA is forced to follow the middle path,
i.e. it has to be 50% in favour of the mill owners and 50% in favour of the
workers. As some of the workers want 100% benefits for them, such workers
regard the TLA's attitude as 'pro-mill' type. (Sharma 1980: 137)

This statement further confirms that the compromise was not born in
the final stage of negotiations with the employers, but had already been
taken into account in the package of demands that were initially placed
on the table.

The participation of the TLA members extended little further than
the election of their representatives, the _pratinidhis_. Often the candidates
for this position of shop steward had already been chosen by a select
group of stakeholders. The workers with permanent contracts in the
departments concerned were not given the chance to vote for another
candidate. The position was lucrative enough to have been auctioned off
in advance. The shop stewards collected the members' contributions ---
which varied in 1979 between just under 2 rupees a month for the
lowest-paid workers to a little more than 4 rupees for the highest paid ---
and acted as intermediaries for the workers in their dealings with the
management and the union office. At the mill they would discuss the
workers' grievances and requests (for leave, transfer to another gang,
reimbursement of costs incurred through illness, etc) with the bosses and
would expect to be paid for the favour. From non-regular employees they
would demand donations for their help in getting their temporary
contracts extended. Newcomers also had to pay the shop stewards for
mediating in their recruitment. These sources of additional income for
the _pratinidhi_ in fact signified a continuation of the practices for which
the _mukadams_ had been notorious, but the margins within which the
union representatives operated were smaller than those of their predecessors.
Close to the shopfloor, this petty corruption was highly visible and
complaints made the shop stewards more vulnerable than the old-style
jobbers. The stewards were also gate-keepers of the union office on
matters relating to membership administration and were mandated to
discuss grievances that could only be settled with the intervention of
union officials. As the mouthpiece of the union in the mills, the _pratinidhis_
had to report back on the mood among the workers and on the activities
of rival unions. Articles in _Majoor Sandesh_ alerted the workers against
agitators who were out to disrupt the so valuable but fragile industrial
peace.

Workers with leadership ambitions had no opportunity to climb to
the office ranks within the union. Election to the Central Executive
Committee was the highest they could aspire to, and then only if they
were not seen to be overly assertive. Anyone who was critical of the
course decreed by the leadership was shown no mercy. Chauhan describes
the fate of two _pratinidhis_ who were not satisfied with the humble
position they had achieved.

>A representative named Motibhai wanted to make career as an office bearer.
Unwisely, he demanded an election. As a result, no mill in Ahmedabad was
willing to give him a job. Ultimately he had to leave the city and go back to his
native place. A similar incident took place when Balabhai Wasta, better known as
Bala Wasta, opposed an election. As a consequence the final part of his working
life was made utterly miserable. I never allowed my political views to interfere
with social work. Many times _Majoor Mahajan_ offered me a job with salary for
my athletic activities. But I declined every time since I was wary of such
dependence. (Parmar 1989: 43)

The TLA bosses did not succeed in taming all mill workers. Each and
every neighbourhood used to have a few _dadas_, leaders of loosely structured
gangs known for their toughness and bravado. Labelled as _goondas_
in the language of authority they competed with each other for deference
and fear in the local gymkhanas, betting shops, and drinking booths.

In the union documentation, the emphasis is on the obedience with
which the members were supposed to follow the policy set out by their
leaders. Generally speaking, although the rank and file might sometimes
respond with miscomprehension and even some slight resistance, common
sense soon prevailed. In the authorized view, the workers understood
that they did not possess the knowledge, the reasonableness, and
the patience to achieve their aims directly and completely. This suggests
that the TLA was successful in persuading its members that consultation,
compromise and, failing that, arbitration were a much more sensible way
of preserving or improving their terms of employment than agitation
and confrontation. They had to be made aware that the righteous
struggle entailed taking account of the interests of society as a whole. In
his speeches, Gandhi had repeatedly told the workers that striking was
permitted only as a last resort to obtain recognition for the value and
dignity of labour. And even then, he had urged them to restrain their
desire for confrontation.

>Consistent with his philosophy of non-violence, he taught workers how to
conduct a strike in a non-violent manner. For instance, he emphasised that the
demands by the workers should be reasonable. Secondly, throughout the period
of strike, workers should maintain discipline, i.e. they should not use abusive
language and should not entertain ill feelings towards the owners. Once that is
done, workers should steadfastly wait till the demand is satisfied. Throughout
their struggle, workers should not depend upon the subscription from others but
must find some alternative, temporary employment. (Soman 1957: 69--70)

### Clientism as an Expression of Self Interest

The success of this policy of internalization among at least part of the
membership is indicated by Masihi's comment that some of his respondents
were proud not of having taken part in strikes but of having been
strike-breakers (Masihi 1985: 129). It may, of course, have been the case
that the TLA members said what their leaders wanted to hear. The need
to appear to toe the union line and yet to sometimes spontaneously
express their own opinions occasionally led them to make contradictory
statements. This explains why workers questioned by Masihi were prepared
to admit that working harder and earning more was good for both
employers and employees, while the majority of them at the same time
claimed that rationalization was beneficial for the former and detrimental
to the latter. The limits to their docility became apparent when the
members refused to follow the leadership in its party political preferences.
At important moments, the Gandhian leaders discovered that
their members were no longer at their side but had deserted them, such
as when they supported the movement set up by Indulal Yagnik. Gandhi
had chosen not to activate the working class during the struggle for
national independence. For a long time, the Congress succeeded in
maintaining its power in Ahmedabad by using the TLA as an instrument
to recruit voters in the industrial neighbourhoods. This domination
came to an end, however, when Yagnik emerged as a populist leader who
offered an alternative to the established order, which had failed to fulfil
its pledges to the lower income classes to provide better housing and
public amenities.

The members of the TLA were loyal to their leaders not out of
ideological conviction but for more pragmatic reasons. These were based
on the fact that the union had been given a monopoly position with
respect to negotiations with the employers. The union not only represented
their collective interests but also helped individual members to
get their grievances heard, favours granted, etc. It was much more
difficult for non-members to get their problems or wishes heard. As we
have seen, the TLA shop steward was a key figure in the contact between
the workers and both the mill management and the union's bosses. The
_pratinidhis_ collected the membership fees on payday from the gang
working under them. From this amount, which they took to the union's
office in cash, they were given a five % commission. These brokers
also played a decisive role in the recruitment of fresh hands and their
subsequent promotion from temporary to permanent workers.

For the lower ranks the mill hierarchy was nearly as flat and fixed as
it was a half a century earlier. Workers tended to spend their whole
working lives in the same department. Masihi observed that two-thirds
of his respondents had worked in the same mill for over 20 years. A
change of job almost always meant moving to a different mill to do the
same work. The recommendation of the _pratinidhi_ was of great significance
for newcomers to the mills. Their admission to the workforce
occurred in two stages: first, they were taken on as substitute workers
(_badli_), and later they would be given a permanent contract. Much later
in life an ex-mill worker narrated how he got his first job as a young boy.

>I started carrying my father's tiffin during his night shift and while there I learned
the work of a doffer. My father was operating a shaving machine in the framing
department of the spinning division. Three to four days had passed and I was still
a trainee when one worker did not turn up after the recess hour. My father being
a _pratinidhi_ appointed by _Majoor Mahajan Sangh_, the Master wanted to do him
a favour and suggested that I be retained instead of calling a _badli_ worker waiting
outside at the mill gate. My father said, 'He has not yet learned the job properly'.
Master replied, 'So what, he will shuffle a couple of bobbins, what else needs to
be done?' And took me to the office of the time keeper . ... In this way I started
my work in the mill in June 1961. In the beginning, other workers carried out
my share of work. I kept on learning and slowly got the knack of it and started
filling up as _badli_ for doffer. (Jivan Thakore 2002: 11)

It should come as no surprise that those who refused to join the TLA
had less chance of being offered a permanent position. The shop steward
was under pressure from the workers in his department to get their
brothers or sons onto the payroll, first as reserve labourers and then as
permanent employees. The price of this mediation took the form not
only of a monetary payment but also acceptance of his leadership in all
aspects. Notwithstanding the irritation caused by the corrupt practices
of the _pratinidhis_, the workers were dependent on his goodwill for the
admission of their relatives to the labour force. This dependence meant
that they would only complain to the management of the union if his
conduct were particularly excessive. It is therefore not so surprising to
ascertain that half of the _pratinidhis_ were in office for 15 years or more
(Masihi 1985: 104).

The willingness of the members to go along with the agenda of the
Gandhian union and to respect the authority of its leaders was grounded
in a conscious self-interest. But this does not mean that they were free of
suspicion and criticism. Many complained that the TLA's leaders had
more contact with the mill owners, and felt more at ease with them, than
with the workers. In the long history of the union there are examples
enough of the members refusing to follow the instructions of their
leaders and even arguing with Gandhi himself. Did the workers become
more assertive as time passed? The progress achieved in the righteous
struggle would tend to support this assumption. An increasing selfconfidence
is after all often considered an important indication of an
improvement in employment conditions. The corresponding argument
that the early generations of textile workers were characterized by a large
dose of naivety and docility may testify to a prejudiced view that is
difficult to reconcile with the facts. Interesting in this respect are the
events of 1923, when the TLA leadership called for an end to the wave of
industrial agitation. The general strike, which had started that year as a
protest against the mill owners' proposals to cut wages by 20%,
had failed and the workers had no other choice than to return to work.
At least, that was the advice of the union leaders. Anasuyaben, Shankarlal
Banker, Gulzarilal Nanda and Khandubhai Desai had called the members
to a meeting in what had become a very sacred place: Amar Bawalia,
the tree on the banks of the Sabarmati river where Gandhi had appealed
to the workers a few years previously to commit themselves to the
righteous struggle.

>The atmosphere was tense and expectant. First Anasuya, as the seniormost and
one held in the highest regard and affection spoke a few words supporting the
call to end the strike. Shankarlal followed suit. The workers listened patiently but
it was clear from their faces that they were deeply distressed. At that point
representatives of the workers approached Anasuya and others and asked them to
retire for some time as it was advisable and desirable that the workers should
confer independently among themselves in their leaders' absence to come to a
conclusion. They promised to convey their decision once their deliberations
were over. So the leaders quietly withdrew from the arena. (Kamath and Kher
1993: 228)

This incident illustrates that in the past too the opportunity existed ---
and was taken advantage of --- for the members to discuss the pros and
cons of the union's policy amongst themselves, without the leaders being
present.

The designation of the TLA as representative union at the end of the
1930s, in line with the industrial relations legislation that came into
force at that time, prevented the defection of many members to unions
with more radical programmes. Yet a number of small unions managed
to survive in the shadow of the Gandhian union, whose dominant
position had been confirmed in this way. They offered an alternative to
activists who had emerged at the local level and who had no chance of
acquiring positions of importance within the TLA. One of these was
Vasantlal Chauhan, whose increasing political awareness had alienated
him from the TLA, in which he had been active for many years. Another
_Dalit_ activist who was annoyed by the authoritarian leadership of the
union and took offence at its meagre efforts to put a stop to the excesses
of untouchability was Karsandas Parmar. He eventually returned to the
TLA when he realized that no other organization possessed such a large
apparatus with which to defend the collective and individual interests of
the working people. And lastly, there was Karachabhai, who was the first
factory worker to be elected to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.
Disappointed at what his position within the Congress fraction had
produced for the people living in the industrial neighbourhoods, this
former model member did not hesitate at an advanced age to lend his
support to Yagnik and his Worker's Struggle Committee (KSS).[^/8/2] Various
informants who were members of other unions told Masihi that they had
left the TLA because they were annoyed at the lack of consultation with
the rank and file. 'Some members proudly said that they were not 'yes
men' but belonged to the opposition.' (Masihi 1985: 100). The price
they had to pay for their deviant behaviour included being punished
more often by the mill management than TLA members for all kinds of
offences.

[^/8/2]: His desertion did not last long. When he realized that Yagnik's movement also
promised more than it achieved he returned to the TLA fold.


It would on the other hand be incorrect to give the impression that
workers chose another organization purely from political motives. That
was true of a number of unions, such as the Communist-oriented Lal
Vavta Mill Kamdar Union, the Maha Gujarat Mill Mazdoor Union,
which was linked to _Janata Parishad_, and the Ahmedabad Mill Mazdoor
Union (also known as the Indicate Union), which owed its existence to
the split in the Congress Party in 1969. The Ahmedabad Mill Mazdoor
Mandal and the Sarni Kamdar Association had no political affiliations.
The members of the latter were almost exclusively Muslims who worked
in the drawing-in department in the mills. The Ahmedabad Mill Mazdoor
Sangh was a later addition, set up in 1952 by a time clerk and affiliated
nationally to the Bharatiya Mill Mazdoor Sangh. The latter had a strong
anti-leftist bias and professed its sympathy for a militant form of political
Hinduism at an early stage. The strength of these alternative unions was
not in the size of their membership, which was very small in most cases.
Nor did they have a wide reach, their membership usually being restricted
to a few mills. But their presence was an obstacle to the TLA's
monopoly position, described as follows by the leader of the MKU:

>For the TLA we constitute a nuisance. In all its decisions and their implementations
the TLA has to keep that in mind. Because the nuisance has by now become
too big to be ignored. (Majmundar 1973: 124)

What must be emphasized lastly is that the membership of a union was
closely related to the social identity of the worker. This applied perhaps
least to those organizations which were allied to a political party and
which subscribed to its political ideology. As mentioned earlier, there was
a clear link between caste or religion and access to a certain occupational
group. And the choice of a union tended to follow automatically from
the worker's occupation. It was not so much that class and caste were
conflicting organizational principles. It was simply that social identity
determined which department a newcomer had access to and that
usually implied membership of a particular union. The members of the
unaffiliated Ahmedabad Mill Mazdoor Mandal, for example, largely
worked in the departments where the cloth received its final processing.
This also meant that they tended to come from higher castes. The
collective action conducted by the TLA was not only in the economic
interests of its members. The way the union was organized actually
reinforced identities based on caste and religion. A number of the smaller
unions attracted members who did not have their roots in Ahmedabad
and who, as immigrants from afar, were trying to make their way in the
urban milieu. They satisfied their need to belong to a community by
joining an organization whose members originated from the same region
(_e.g._ Rajasthan or Uttar Pradesh).

### A Labour Aristocracy

Were the mill workers aware that they were an industrial vanguard and,
as such, constituted a distinct class separate from the mass of the working
population who were dependent for their survival on irregular, unskilled,
and low-paid work in the informal sector of the city's economy? Technological
progress over a period of more than a century undoubtedly
demanded a steadily better quality of mill labour to operate increasingly
complex machines. But higher productivity was also achieved by tightening
up supervision. The mill owners were more and more concerned
with rationalization, but they gave it special attention in two campaigns,
first in the 1930s and then again in the 1960s. Both were aimed at
reducing costs, and entailed the dismissal of labour that had subsequently
become superfluous. The much larger part of the workforce that
retained their jobs had to accept a heavier workload, but were given a
wage rise in return. In this way rationalization, as a recurring principle of
industrial management, helped to increase the gap between those who
worked in the mills and those who worked elsewhere.

In the course of time, different criteria were applied to decide which
workers could stay and which had to go. In 1891, women were sacked in
response to a legal measure that shortened their working days. Another
reason for the dismissals offered by the employers was that women were
not capable of operating faster machines or several machines at the same
time. It was also claimed that they reported sick more often than men
and that their pattern of absenteeism fluctuated much more than that of
male hands. The fact that this 'defect' was due to their heavier duties in
the household was an inconvenience which the employers were not
prepared to make allowances for. The growing imbalance in the gender
composition of the industrial proletariat was exacerbated in 1933 when
the majority of the remaining women were forced to give up their jobs.
Most had worked in the first stage of production, processing the raw
cotton and spinning the thread. This work was now to be performed by
men.

The policy of expulsion during the recession was drawn up and
implemented in close cooperation with the TLA. Gandhian morality
was opposed to the presence of women in the mills and to their
participating in gainful employment away from home in general. This
perspective must be seen in the light of the rough working climate for
which the textile mills were notorious up to the middle of the twentieth
century. The presence of men and women, most of them young, in the
same workplace inevitably led to the use of language and to physical
contact that was considered improper and undesirable in puritanical
eyes. Gandhi himself repeatedly spoke of this with distaste, while his
followers were shocked when they became aware of the loose morals on
the shopfloor. This is illustrated by the following passage.

>The jobber enjoyed the women in mills heartily and with impunity. It is said that
workers were so much under the control of the jobber that he alone whose wife
was comparatively the most beautiful and in the service of the jobber was allowed
by him to be elected as a representative to the TLA in its infancy. The interviewee,
an experienced and old worker who revealed this to the writer, warned
him not to read too much into that statement from the point of view of sex
morals or conventional standards of sex behaviour. For according to him in those
days there was nothing unnatural or unusual in males and females in mills taking
unlimited liberties with each other during working hours or jobbers and their
bosses flirting with female workers even when mills were working. (Majmundar
1973: 145)

The exploitation and oppression to which labouring poor, and women
much more so than men, were exposed occurred at all levels, including in
the working class habitat, where the strong took advantage of the weak.
This does not detract from the fact that the informant, cited in the
second part of the above passage, rightly points out that bourgeois sexual
morals are far removed from the conduct of both men and women in the
cotton mills --- and outside them, for that matter.

In the view of the TLA, the women were expelled from the mills in
their own interests. The underlying idea was that, back at home, they
could devote themselves to looking after their husbands and children.
Their exemption from paid work, to allow them to perform all kinds of
tasks in the household that they had until then not had time to do --- or
at least, not adequately --- was part and parcel of the Gandhian mission to
elevate the lives of the workers to a higher plane. The working class
should arrange their lives in accordance with the norms and values of a
bourgeois lifestyle. This cultural ideal testified to a prejudice that betrayed
the high caste/class origins of those who wished to save the
workers from themselves. Yet the convictions that inspired them were
grounded in a genuine sympathy for the mill workers' miserable lot.
Gandhi explained his position on the presence of women in the factories
to a group of workers in the following terms.

>Today, workers have to send their women and children to work in the mills. It is
our duty to stop this. For the sake of three or four rupees, children are compelled
to work and sacrifice their schooling. Even women should not feel the compulsion
to work in the mills. They have enough to do at home. They should pay
attention to the upbringing of their children. We have to do this if we desire to
improve the quality and sweetness of workers' lives. (Kamath and Kher 1993: 199)

A precondition for the departure of women was a wage rise for the men
who kept their jobs. But they had to make up for this increase in income
by accepting a considerably heavier workload. In the eyes of the TLA this
was hardly a problem, considering the slow and haphazard pace of work
in the production process. That this intensification of the labour process
was spoken of so lightly --- this will be considered in greater detail later in
the context of discipline --- does not alter the fact that the union's plea for
a living wage testified to a strong progressive conviction. The workers'
pay should be enough to cover the basic needs of the man, his wife and
two children. In this view, the man was the breadwinner who, as a caring
husband, used his wages to exempt his wife from paid work, to enable
her to devote herself entirely to her household duties (including taking
care of her husband), and to give his children (also exempt from having
to work) an education. But what at first sight appears to be a sympathetic
goal of improving the living standards of the workers was actually
grounded in a dogmatic and patriarchal view of the social role of women.
The remainder of Gandhi's speech to the workers in Ahmedabad, which
focused on keywords such as honour, purity, and chastity, exposed the
narrow-mindedness of this approach.

>They may give peace to the husband when he returns home tiredly, minister to
him, soothe him if angry and do any other work they can staying at home. It is
not for our women to go out and work as men do. If we send them to the
factories, who will look after our domestic and social affairs? If women go out to
work, our social life will be ruined and moral standards will decline ... I feel
convinced that for men and women to go out for work together will mean the fall
of both. Do not, therefore, send your women out to work, protect their honour,
if you have any manliness in you, it is for you to see that no one casts an evil eye
on them ... (Patel 1988: 380--1).

There was every reason to increase the workers' pay. Calculations had
shown that in 1926 real wages in the textile industry were half that
required to meet basic needs (Majmundar 1973: 93). But was the new
rate agreed by employers and employees in 1933 enough to fulfil the
basic needs of the latter's families? Not in the least. As always, in the
negotiations, the TLA did not insist on the wage level that would
guarantee a minimum existence for the workers and their families, but
agreed 'provisionally' to a compromise far below that level. As a consequence,
the workers did not earn enough for their families to survive.
The implications are clear. The expulsion of the women from the mills in
the 1930s by no means freed them of the obligation to work. They still
had to engage in gainful employment and now had to find it, on
conditions which were much inferior to their tasks in the mills, in the
informal sector of the economy. There is no reference at all to this
situation in the union records. The second wave of rationalization in the
early 1960s led to further redundancies. The percentage of women left
working in the mills was by then reduced to a fraction of the total
workforce. In the last decade of the nineteenth century, one in five or six
workers was a woman; around 1970 this had fallen to one in every 20.

As a result of this gender-based discrimination, which the TLA
enthusiastically went along with, the last generation of the workforce in
the textile mills was almost exclusively male. Does the term labour
aristocracy adequately describe this rationalized army, which totalled
more than 150,000 workers in the mid 1970s? In the first chapter I
referred to the study by Gooptu, in which she explained that the
distinction between the formal and informal sectors in the urban economy
has not crystallized into a dual segmentation. Although I understand her
argument, I adopted a different viewpoint. I defended the standpoint
that, as early as the turn of the century, there were already substantial
differences in the nature, rhythm, and duration of work in the two
sectors, and in terms of employment. In the decades since then, the
distinction has become even more marked. The growing added value of
labour in this modern branch of industry was particularly related to the
following factors. First, the progressive regulation of the working day,
not only by introducing breaks but also by restricting its length, from 12
hours or more to ten and then to eight. Gandhi explained why this was
necessary, with the proviso that working hours should not be shortened
at the expense of production.

>The mill hands seem to be working for twelve hours or more. Those who have to
work for so many hours per day can have no time left for mental or moral
betterment. Their condition is that of the beast. It is our duty to escape the peril
and yet, in every step we take, we must guard against damaging industries.
(Kamath and Kher 1993: 208)

Second, limits were imposed on child labour, first by raising the minimum
age limit for working and then by banning it completely. Third,
the level of schooling was increased. This took the form of a gradual
improvement in literacy and of improving skills in the operation of
machinery, picked up in daily practice rather than through any formal
training. Fourth, there was a gradual improvement in terms of employment.
Although, as I already mentioned in chapter two, reports right up
to the 1970s spoke of bad working conditions in almost all the mills,
drinking water, toilets and other elementary facilities had become a
normal feature of most factories. No doubt, the working environment
was still dirty, dangerous, and a health hazard, but to lesser extent than
three-quarters of a century earlier.

Fifth, the industrial workers were treated with greater dignity. The
cruelty of the jobbers and other bosses higher up in the mill management
had not been forgotten, but had become horrific memories of a time
gone by. Workers were still firmly put in their place, but more often with
verbal rather than physical violence. A sign that times had changed was
that now they could complain about such treatment --- and did, especially
if they had been punished unfairly or beyond the prevailing limits
(Masihi 1985: 123). Sixth, the already existing gap between the income
from work in the _bazar_ economy and that of the industrial workers had
increased. The real wages of the latter were much higher. The greater
value of their labour was expressed in a wide variety of fringe benefits,
such as dearness allowance and bonus scheme, and even a reimbursement
for using the bicycle to come to work. The arguments which the
employers proposed to try and avoid paying an annual bonus --- it would
lead to greater absenteeism and the extra money would be spent on
drink --- were unable to hold back the progressive improvement of the
lives of this vanguard of the working class.

Seventh, in course of time, industrial legislation had incorporated
provisions to protect against the risks of premature dismissal. Health
insurance guaranteed free or low-cost medical care for the worker himself
and the members of this household (not only immediate family members
but also parents or other relatives living in the same house). And on
retirement the workers were entitled to a benefit from the Provident
Fund.

There can be no avoiding the conclusion that industrial labour was in
a far better situation just prior to the closure of the dozens of textile mills
at the end of the 1970s than it had been at the start of the twentieth
century. But was the situation so favourable that this industrial vanguard
could be seen as a labour aristocracy?

To emphasize the progress achieved I would like to focus attention on
a number of other aspects relating to the formalization of industrial
relations in the modern sector of the economy. To put the improvements
in perspective, it is important to remember that they largely have their
origins in the labour legislation that started to take shape in the latecolonial
era. The framework of industrial relations was created during
that period --- the Bombay Industrial Disputes Act of 1938, discussed in
the previous chapter, was an early and prominent example --- but it would
have to wait until national independence before it was effectively implemented
(_see also_ Chandavarkar 1994: 17).

The significance of the change in wage payment from piecework to
timerate, as a trend running through the history of the textile industry,
must be recognized. I would like to repeat what I said in the first chapter,
that this changeover --- which became manifest at times when the demand
for labour exceeded the local supply, such as at the end of the
nineteenth century was crucial. The stubborn insistence of the mill
owners in continuing to pay workers not on the basis of the number of
hours worked but for the amount they produced is shown by the fact
that, in 1935, many mills adhered to the earlier custom of giving weavers
part of their wages in kind, by sending them home with rejected cloth
(Kamath and Kher 1993: 311).

A second factor that testifies to a real change in the way in which
employment was organized was the growing standardization of terms of
employment. The custom of not paying workers who did the same work
the same level of pay, but paying them according to their relations with
the bosses --- the jobbers in the first instance, but also those higher up ---
was maintained for a long time. This practice had nothing to do with
experience or quality of work, but was characterized by random favour
and prejudice. The TLA's efforts to ensure that its members were paid
roughly the same wage for the same work in all the mills were an
important step forward in the principle and practice of industrial fairness.

A final indication that the relationship between labour and capital
had become somewhat less tilted was the TLA's demand to be given
access to the employers' financial accounts. The employers must have
received an enormous shock when this demand was first tabled at the end
of the 1920s. The union's negotiators argued that they needed the
company's profit and loss statistics to be able to determine how much
pressure to apply in their demands for higher wages. Gandhi had after all
made it clear that the entrepreneurs were duty-bound to pay their
workers a living wage, however defined. The extent of wage demands
depended on the companies' profitability. From this perspective the
request to open the books was as understandable and significant as the
employers' reluctance to grant it. The latter would insist right up to the
final closure of the mills that this demand was an unacceptable erosion of
their prerogative as entrepreneurs. Their standpoint confirmed once
again that the employers did not, as Gandhi had urged, consider their
workers as members of the same family. In their view, the relationship
between owner and employee was that between master and servant.

Against the background of the disintegration of civil society at the end
of the 20th century, there is a tendency to attribute special characteristics
to the industrial system that developed in Ahmedabad, as a result of the
beneficial impact of Gandhian principles on the balance between capital
and labour. Striking a middle path between both parties, the father of the
nation is seen as having reconciled employers and employees by appealing
to a long-standing, traditional social morality. This interpretation
suggests an equality of interests which never existed and which ignores
the hierarchical foundations of Gandhi's ideas. The concept of trusteeship
is an expression of the relationship which seems to suggest that
higher = superior and lower = inferior. Gandhi's incessant campaign
against untouchability certainly helped the _Dalits_ who had joined the
industrial working class to assert themselves against discriminatory practices
which they experienced in daily life. Jivan Thakore, however,
graphically describes how caste lines had not loosened much when he
went to the mill at the age of sixteen in 1961.

>Since the mill owner was a Bania by caste, the workfloor management (in
contrast to the workers) were either Banias or Brahmins. My betrothal had taken
place in childhood and I used to be addressed respectfully as 'Jivanji' or 'Jivanlal'
by my in-laws. So when the Master took me to the Time Keeper's office who then
asked my name, I had promptly replied, 'Jivanlal Vithaldas Thakore'. The Time
Keeper exchanged a sniggering and amused look with the Head Time Keeper at
the next table. (I came to know later that both were Brahmins). The Head Time
Keeper said to me, 'If \[lower castes\] Thakedas take on the name of Brahmins and
Banias, what are we supposed to do? Take on _Harijan_ and _Vaghri_ names, should
we?' Then looking at Master, he asked, 'Whose boy have you picked up?' Master
replied, 'he is Vithaldas Bhagat's boy'. On hearing my father's name he instructed
the Time Keeper to hire me. The Time Keeper followed his instructions and
entered my name into the register for half-day attendance. He wrote 'Jiva Vithal'
for my name which did not escape my notice, but I kept mum. Gladly, Master
took me out of the office and remarked, 'Good for you, you got your half-day's
attendance. Had the _baaman_ \[note: a pejorative term for Brahmin\] not been
around, it would not have been possible. Usually the Head Time Keeper left by
six p.m., but fortunately he had stayed back for some reason that day. Once I
reached the department I complained to my father that my name had been
distorted in the register. Reassuringly he said, 'Never mind the name, we are
concerned with the _rotlas_ and not with the nonsense that goes into making it'.
(Thakore 2002: 11--12)

### Blocking the path to Emancipation

The _Dalit_ temple entry movements which started towards the end of
colonial rule signalled the growing militancy of the scheduled castes in
their struggle for emancipation. Makrant Mehta has written an essay on
this episode in West India (Mehta 2002). Ambedkar himself led in 1930
the campaign for entering the Kalaram temple in Nasik, visited by many
Hindu pilgrims and revered as the place where Ram lived in exile. The
passing of the 1947 _Harijan_ Temple Entry Act in the state of Bombay in
1947 which was the direct outcome of this social movement, motivated
the _Dalits_ of Ahmedabad to launch a _satyagraha_ for seeking admittance
to a Swaminarayan temple in Sarangpur, a locality dominated by mills
and mill workers. Swami Sahajanand, the founder of this sect, had
gained a massive following among the lower castes of Gujarat while
preaching the unity of mankind during his life (1781--1830). After his
demise the leaders of the sect did not abide by the gospel of brotherhood,
universal love, and social harmony but started to block the entry of lower
castes. In the course of time the _Kanbi Patels_, upwardly mobile as
_Patidars_, constituted the major part of the devotees. Presenting themselves
as _savarnas_ (high caste people) they distanced themselves from the
subordinated segments among the population and especially from the
_Dalits_. The Swaminaryan priests did not any longer allow these 'outsiders'
to come to the shrine. In defiance of the new act passed in the year of
Independence the orthodox sects in Gujarat refused to open their
temples to _Dalits_. _Savarna_ _satyagrahis_ demonstrated their resistance
with much clamour, provoking a militant reaction from the excluded
audience. The legal protection provided by the post-colonial state facilitated
the fight against discrimination but the _Satsangis_, followers of the
Swaminarayan sect, did not capitulate. What began as essentially a
religious issue got transformed into a political confrontation.

>The Utarayan (kite flying) festival on 14 January 1948 was selected for _satyagraha_
>in front of the Kalupur temple of this sect. All _Dalits_ were to gather there to enter
>the temple. I, with my friends took up the publicity campaign. A wave of unity
>was seen among all _Dalits_ of Ahmedabad. On Utarayan day _bhajan mandals_
>from various localities started flocking to the temple gates. The priests had
>locked up the gates as a preventive measure. _Dalits_ were outraged by this insult.
>Picketing on the gates started as _bhajan mandals_ from various mills took turns in
>sitting outside the gate. The youngsters from Shapur, Mirzapur and Dhariyapur
>had made the gate their home. This _satyagraha_ went on for many days till the
>matter went to court. The head priests of Swaminarayan declared in the court
>that 'the _Dalits_ can not get entry to this temple because it is not a Hindu temple.
>
>(Parmar 1989: 27; _see also_ Parmar and Chaudhari 1998: 66)

Asking for enforcement of the law the members of the excluded community
declared a strike in the textile mills which lasted for more than one
week. They were joined by the Bhangis employed by the municipality
and garbage collection came to a halt in the city. But the _acharya_ of the
Swaminarayan temple held his ground. Claiming that the _Harijan_ Temple
Entry Act did not apply, his argument was that the sect did not practice
Hinduism but a religion of its own. The _Dalits_ were not his only target.
In a public speech he stated:

>It is a sin to allow untouchables into the Hindu temples ... We are passing through
a critical period. The internal invasion is from the untouchables and the external
one is from the Muslims and Pakistan. I am not advising you to murder Muslims,
but at least show them that we are now awakened and united (Mehta 2002:13)

Three days before his assassination, by an agent of political Hinduism,
Gandhi gave his verdict on the agitation going on in Ahmedabad. He
emphasized that the untouchables were an integral part of the Hindu
social order and that the temples must be thrown open to all, irrespective
of caste and creed. He added, however, that the act of _satyagraha_ for the
temple entry was irreligious and sinful. Instead of forcing their way in,
the _Harijans_ should humbly and patiently wait until the _Savarnas_ would
welcome them into their temples. Both then and later the spokesmen for
the movement acknowledged that what inspired them were not religious
considerations but their assertion of civic rights, cultural freedom, and
social dignity.

In vain the TLA leaders warned the mill workers not to mix 'spiritual'
with 'worldly' matters. They were more worried when their appeal for an
end to the strike, made under pressure from the textile barons, fell on
deaf ears. The union members once again refused to follow the orders
given from above and this in itself was enough to suspect the hidden
hand of atheist and leftist agitators, specifically the communist Ahmedabad
Mill Mazdur Union under the command of Dinkar Mehta. To defuse
further escalation, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, then Home and Deputy
Prime Minister of India, rushed to Ahmedabad. He admonished the
Swaminarayan authorities to give up their resistance but was more brutal
in condemning the strikers.

>Why have you linked the religious issue with the economic? Remember, the days
of demonstrations and fasts are now over. We are not going to tolerate that.
Those who still want to remain hungry, let them do so. This will remove shit
from their stomach and will purify them. (quoted in M. Mehta 2002: 15 with
references to D.Mehta 1968 and Dh. Oza 1988)

The visit of Sardar Patel brought an end to the _satyagraha_. The strike
was over and the mills started to operate again without the opposite party
having to make any concession. The legal battle went on until the
Supreme Court gave a ruling against the Swaminarayan sect in 1966. By
then many _Dalits_ had lost interest in entering the temples which so
clearly had become the shrines of the petty and high bourgeoisie.

### Discipline

In a previous section I have listed various arguments which appear to
confirm that the textile workers constituted an aristocracy within the
working class. I would now like to present my reservations regarding
such an appraisal. They are all related to the rigorous discipline to which
the employees in the textile industry were subjected.

First of all, Gandhian social ideology taught that the struggle to
improve the lot of the workers must be restricted in advance by taking
account of the interests of the opposite party. This not only had implications
for the ultimate aim of the struggle but also for the way in which it
was to be conducted: consultation in place of contestation or confrontation,
deferential requests in place of forceful demands, and the willingness
to make concessions to enable a compromise to be reached, respect
for the opposite party rather than resentment, etc., etc. But were the
employers also prepared to do the same? That there were serious doubts
about this among the TLA leadership is illustrated by a letter from
Nanda to Banker in 1933. In violation of the earlier agreement that any
changes to the terms of employment must be made in consultation with
the other party, the AMA was about to cut wages drastically. The
decision was not negotiable. Nanda wrote that the mill owners lacked the
willingness to accept the principles of negotiation and arbitration.

>As long as it is the question of only tolerating the organisation \[i.e. TLA\] as a
necessary nuisance when it is too strong for them and of constantly trying to
undermine its strength and influence \[i.e. when it is weak\] ... the conditions of
successful co-operation do not exist. The best way to settle this is a good, hard
strike. (Patel 1987: 121)

Furthermore the mili workers had to realize that the righteous struggle
not only aimed to improve their lives in a material sense. From the first
moment that he began to take an interest in their situation, Gandhi had
urged them to purge their lives of all kinds of bad habits. It was due to
their own failings that they were unable to achieve emancipation. Selfeducation
in virtue, diligence, and sobriety were essential conditions for
the guidance that social reformers were prepared to give. The lack of
discipline was expressed in antisocial behaviour. I have already mentioned
the anger of Gandhi and his followers when they heard of the fury
that swept through the industrial districts in Ahmedabad in response to
Gandhi's arrest in 1919. In a speech a year later commemorating the
setting up of the TLA, the father of the nation condemned all forms of
violence as testimony to a lack of civic behaviour. After having scolded
his audience for taking part in the riots in the city, Gandhi went on to
accuse them of thinking of nothing other than higher wages.

>We cannot become rich by merely getting more wages. Nor is becoming wealthy
the all-in-all. Anasuyabehn has not dedicated her life to you merely for the
purpose of securing for you better wages. Her object in doing so is that you may
get enough to make you happy, to make you truly religious, that you may observe
the eternal laws of ethics, etc., that you make good use of your earnings, that you
may keep your houses clean and that you may educate your children. (Kamath
and Kher 1993: 206)

Not only the employers, but the union leaders, too, were despondent in
their belief that the morals of the textile workers had not really improved
over time. As I mentioned earlier, the TLA had been sharply critical of
the sabotage committed by the workers in protest at the unbearable
humidity and heat in the mills. Exhortations to carry out their tasks
properly and punctually and only to leave the workfloor under exceptional
circumstances had no effect. In 1953, after repeated appeals to the
workers' sense of duty failed to bring about any improvement, the AMA
introduced an 'anti-loitering' code with which they had to comply.

1. All workers should present themselves on duty at the scheduled
   hours.
2. They should not leave their respective places of duty within an hour
   of the commencement of the shift, before and after recess and when the
   shift ends.
3. During the continuation of the shift no worker should go out of his
   department without permission and except for a purpose relating to his
   work and that too for not more than twenty minutes. The permission to
   go out will be given according to the convenience of the department and
   in such a way that at a time all workers in the department cannot go out
   of it.
4. Any worker violating clauses (1), (2) and (3) would be considered
   absent for the time for which he goes out loitering and his wages would
   be proportionately deducted in respect thereof in accordance with the
   provision of the Payment of Wages Act. (Majmundar 1973: 195)

Lastly there is the cooperation of the Gandhian union with the
rationalization operation in the textile mills. In the early 1960s a Joint
Rationalization Committee was set up to oversee the operation in
Ahmedabad. It was agreed beforehand that strikes called in sympathy
with the victims would not be tolerated. The cuts in labour costs and the
increases in productivity led to a considerable increase in the workload,
without the workers being consulted in any way at all.

The strict discipline to which the workers in the textile mills were
subjected weakens any image of them as an aristocracy among the
working classes. There is, however, another, more important reason for
not accepting this viewpoint. Until now we have treated the mill workers
as a homogeneous group. This is incorrect, as they can be subdivided
into various categories. The terms of employment for the workers with
permanent jobs were different to those of the _badlis_ who, as reserve
labour, had to adopt a more subordinate attitude and leave no doubt at
all as to their loyalty and diligence. In return for this 'commitment' they
were paid a lower wage and missed out on a wide range of benefits, not
to mention the legal certainty that made a permanent job at the mill so
enviable. In 1949, at the insistence of the government, the Decasualisation
Scheme was introduced, which aimed at registering the reserve workers
as a pool from which the employers would select whenever necessary.
Priority was to be given to workers who had been dismissed as superfluous
because of rationalization or as a result of closure. This rule did not
become effective since mill managers preferred to recruit workers directly
at the factory gates as each shift started. They could then choose
replacements for those who had not shown up because of illness, leave, or
other reasons from among the reserve workers who always gathered there
at these times. The selection was mostly carried out by foremen.

>Except for a few mills, recruitment at any stage in the industry hardly takes place
on objective considerations of merit. The Decasualisation Scheme seems to be
suffering from many abuses and a thorough probe into its working seems to be
essential. (Majmundar 1973: 228)

In spite of the insistence of the TLA, the government of Gujarat refused
to impose any rules to regulate access to work at the mills. The captains
of industry clearly wanted to maintain the _badli_ system as a buffer to
absorb fluctuations in production, but also to restrict their dependence
on workers with permanent contracts. That the casual labourers were not
a small and marginal percentage of the workforce can be seen from the
figures quoted by Sharma for the end of 1979. Of a total of 158,713
textile workers spread over 64 mills, 122,580 were employed permanently
and 36,133 were _badlis_ (Sharma 1980: 151).

The ratio of nearly 4:1 between these two segments of the working
population in the mills belies the impression that it constitutes a homogeneous
whole. The stereotype notion of the mill worker must also be
adjusted in the light of the fact that mill owners tended to contract out
certain tasks in the production process. The workers who performed
these tasks were not employed by the mills but were taken on and
supervized by labour contractors. In its 1940 report, the Bombay Textile
Labour Enquiry Committee referred to this form of employment, which
had already long been in existence. Lakha reports that outsourcing was
also a prominent feature in the textile mills of Ahmedabad.

>These contractors paid lower wages and employed fewer workers than were
normally required under various labour agreements. Managements preferred this
arrangement because it freed them from supervisory responsibilities and reduced
their labour costs. The system offered little job security, for if a contractor lost his
bid, the workers lost their jobs: the new contractor brought his own labourers.
(Lakha 1988: 92--- ; Majmundar 1973: 175--6)

In the following decades the trade union failed to put a stop to --- or
indeed to attempt to put a stop to --- this dominant practice leading to
the informalization of labour. Patel's 1986 study revealed that contract
workers accounted for 10% of the entire workforce in the textile
mills. Nine out of ten came from the lower castes and six out of ten were
women. The latter is a salient point, showing that after being excluded
from formal employment in the mills, many women returned as unskilled
and low-paid labourers, with no security of work and again at the
mercy of the jobbers (Patel 1986: 1813--20).

Contract and reserve workers together accounted for more than onethird
of the total workforce employed in the mills. But does the conclusion
still hold water that the formal terms of employment which applied
to a narrow majority assured them a truly 'aristocratic' existence in
comparison with the rest? Even this statement must be qualified. The
differentiation between the various occupational groups meant that the
lowest paid --- employed in the spinning shops --- lagged far behind their
colleagues in the weaving department or who were involved in various
tasks in the final stages of production. This segmentation was upheld by
the fact that access to the departments for newcomers depended on their
social identity. The least enviable work was reserved for members of the
lower castes, not temporarily, but on a permanent basis. And in the
cleaner departments, where the finished cloth underwent further treatment,
most jobs were reserved for the higher castes. The different
departments were separated by partition walls, with little mutual contact.
Within this context, the worker as an undifferentiated figure
disappeared. It was only by placing him --- the 'her' version had all but
disappeared from the payroll --- in juxtaposition to the floating and much
more numerous army in the _bazar_ economy, was it possible to speak,
whilst recognizing internal differences, of a homogeneous group.

### A Distinct and Uniform Lifestyle?

The regularity of work, the higher income, the protection against illness
and other recurring setbacks, the growing awareness of leisure time, the
ability to plan for the future and to invest in the next generation all
suggest that working in the mills had enhanced the dignity of the
workers' lives. But did these undeniable improvements assure the mill
employees a lifestyle that distinguished them from the mass for whom
these material and immaterial rights and achievements remained inaccessible?
Obviously, this was true to a certain extent, and the textile
workers certainly had an elevated status in the neighbourhoods in which
they lived. The TLA contributed to this by encouraging its members to
educate and, more generally, to develop themselves. If the men were no
longer addicted to drink, dice, and gambling, they had more time and
money to spend on their families. In addition, the union aimed to
'upgrade' the relationship between man and wife, by exempting the latter
from the obligation to work outside the home. Gandhi made it clear that
as long as this did not happen, it was a blemish not only on those
concerned, but on the nation as a whole:

>If men and women are partners in life and complement each of the other, they
become good householders only by dividing their labour and a wise mother finds
her time fully occupied in looking after household and children. But when both
husband and wife have to labour for mere maintenance, the nation must become
degraded. It is like a bankrupt living on his capital. (Kamath and Kher 1993:209)

In the mid 1970s, the TLA had more than 200 full-time and 135 parttime
staff members (Masihi 1985: 18). A large proportion of these
officials took part in a wide variety of activities outside the factory walls,
which were aimed at enhancing the respectability of the rank and file,
both in their own eyes and in those of outsiders. The facilities they
provided included childcare centres, clubs for physical exercise, training
as homeguards, reading rooms for papers and magazines, libraries where
books could be read or borrowed, youth clubs, literacy courses for adults,
sewing and embroidery classes, primary health care centres, maternity
homes, a cooperative bank and a _kadhihat_ (shop). Sharma's study of this
aspect of the TLA's work reveals that the union's propaganda grossly
overestimated its reach and significance. The members showed little or
no interest in many of the facilities on offer (Sharma 1980: 91--2). The
reading rooms, however, were very popular. They functioned as meeting
places, where workers from different mills came not only to read newspapers
but also to exchange information and discuss the political situation
in the city and the state. The union had set up a large number of
ward committees and trusts to supervize this social work and encouraged
people to sit on them. This led to the emergence of neighbourhood
networks, in which aspiring local-level leaders could win their spurs.

The space that had been created in both time and budget allowed
greater latitude in patterns of consumption. Households living on a mill
wage could afford to take a more relaxed approach to the cares of daily
life. If the breadwinner or another member of the family fell ill, it no
longer meant all financial reserves being used up or going into debt to
cover the costs. Under the Employees' State Insurance Scheme (ESIS), to
which the mill workers belonged, they and the other members of their
household were covered for free doctor's treatment and medicines. Their
relatively high wages and, above all, the fact that they were paid regularly,
made the workers more creditworthy. They could buy their daily necessities
in greater bulk and therefore at lower prices, and if necessary on a
weekly or monthly account, because the shopkeepers knew that they
were a safe credit risk. They had holidays on festivals and celebrated them
with special dishes. They could afford more and better clothes and
furniture, and consumer durables like a sewing machine, a bicycle, a
radio and later a television, and a ceiling or table fan. This not only made
their lives more comfortable, but also showed their neighbours that they
were doing well. For larger expenses, such as the marriage of a daughter,
they could borrow money from the union bank, using the Provident
Fund, built up over the years, as security. This ensured that they did not
become indebted to private moneylenders, who demanded high interest,
increasing the dignity of their lives. The children of the mill workers had
the chance of getting an education. After primary school, many went to
secondary school or even on to higher education, instead of having to go
straight out to work. This qualified them for white-collar jobs, which
had been beyond the horizons of earlier generations.

If this lifestyle provided sufficient reason for satisfaction with the
progress that had been made, the improvements in the quality of housing
were much less impressive. The mill-owners persisted in their policy of
not providing housing for the workforce. A survey conducted in 19334
found that nearly 79% of the working class tenements in
Ahmedabad belonged to private landlords; about 11% were
owned by the workers themselves, while only nine % had been
provided by the mill-owners or other employers of labour. Moreover, the
captains of industry extended their control over labour outside the
compounds of their enterprises by providing free housing in the surrounding
neighbourhoods to the security staff which they employed.

>The prevailing practice found in the Ahmedabad mills was to provide 'mill
sepoys' or '_jamadars_' (gate-keepers) with rent-free tenements. This fact signifies
that ensuring coercive discipline within the mills was an organic part of the
housing policies pursued by the Ahmedabad mill-owners. (A.K. Sen 2002: 3964)

The municipality and the mills themselves had built a few thousand
houses over the years, and the TLA had followed this example on an even
smaller scale. This explains why four out of every five mill workers rented
their homes from a private landlord. Also in later years, there were hardly
any programmes for public housing. A survey of the housing societies set
up between 1941 and 1965 showed that, in three-quarters of the cases,
they provided homes for members of the higher castes (Brahmins, Banias
and _Patels_). They were largely civil servants, company staff, or private
businessmen. The working classes remained virtually excluded from this
kind of housing. In a study in 1979 of what they called the _chawl_ slums,
Bhatt and Chawda showed that the residents of almost two-thirds of the
1,094 registered _chawls_ depended for their living on work in the textile
mills.[^/8/3] The _chawls_ gave the industrial neighbourhoods a unique character:
crowded, single-floored one or two-roomed houses in dead-end
alleys, often without the most elementary facilities. Only 18% had
piped water and a mere 2% had their own toilet, while two in
every three had no mains electricity. These tenements were usually in a
bad state of repair because, since the introduction of the Rent Control
Act in 1938, landlords were no longer willing to increase or even
maintain the value of their properties. Tenants had to pay for their own
repairs, and only did so when it was absolutely necessary. This explains
why the average _chawl_ household spent no more than 4% of their
budget on housing costs (Bhatt and Chawda 1979: 13--20). As a result,
the quality of the accommodation available to this industrial vanguard
among the working population was quite poor. Their habitat, consequently,
had a slum-like appearance.

Any description of life in the industrial neighbourhoods in Ahmedabad
would not be complete if the great variety that existed between the
different groups were not emphasized. The textile workers may have
formed a dominant segment in these districts, but they lived among and
alongside other categories of working people. The different types of
employment, whether or not in the formal sector of the economy, were
not reflected in a parallel pattern of segregation in housing arrangements.
The mill workers did not dwell in separate quarters. Even _chawls_
owned by the mills were not populated solely by their employees. A final
reason for rejecting the assumption that the mill workers led a different
life to that of their neighbours is that many of the households had
members with different occupations. Although fathers often managed to
find their sons work at the mills, this was by no means always the case,
and became less common as time went by. In addition, women supplemented
the household income by working at home or outside the house.
As a consequence, formal and informal sector work existed in tandem
not only in the neighbourhood, but also within the household.

The conclusion that factory work was not always the leading factor in
determining how the workers lived is reinforced by the importance of a
completely different principle of social behaviour. The choice of a house
was not always made on the basis of economic considerations only, such
as direct availability, the level of the rent, or the distance from work. Of
equally great, or perhaps even decisive, significance was that the house
was located in an area where the neighbours were from the same caste or
religious group, or came from the same part of the country. This
tendency for primary loyalties to be the major factor in choosing where
to live, meant that there were marked differences between mill workers
who, as members of the same class, had joint interests. This leads to the
conclusion that homogeneity and heterogeneity were not contradictory
and exclusive codes of social organization. They interacted dynamically
and must therefore be understood in terms of this interdependence.

### Organized Labour

The employees in the textile mills in Ahmedabad undertook collective
action in an organized form. This distinguished them from workers in
the informal sector, whose concerted efforts to achieve improvements in
their terms of employment were generally sporadic, short-term, and
strongly localized. The Gandhian union that led the struggle for a better
existence succeeded in getting a large part of the workforce to join its
ranks. When the union was set up, following the strike in 1918, almost
half of the textile workers in the city signed up. After an enormous drop
in membership a few years later, it gradually picked up again and, after
recognition of the TLA as representative union in 1938, returned to its
former level. By the mid twentieth century, 60% of all textile
workers were members of the union and in 1980, according to the TLA's
own figures, this had risen further to 90%. The latter claim is
hardly credible, but even if it is adjusted downwards by about 20%, it still means that around two-thirds of the workforce of this largescale
industry were members of the union. This is an impressive achievement,
which illustrates the success of the TLA's policy. It should, however,
be pointed out that the expansion of formal sector employment in
Ahmedabad was much slower than the growth of the population in the
second half and particularly the final quarter of the twentieth century.
This observation refers not only to the fact that the proportion of the
working population with a formal sector job declined dramatically, but
also that the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union has
decreased rather than increased. If it was incorrect to speak of the textile
workers as a separate class in the past, their elevated position in the city's
economy and labour hierarchy became less and less visible during the
final decades of the twentieth century.

Was the righteous struggle that had been waged for so long not a
source of inspiration for those who took part in it to organize the
collective action of other segments of the urban proletariat along similar
lines? In answering this question in the negative, it is necessary to add
that there is no evidence to suggest that this option was ever considered
by the TLA's leaders. The involvement of a few Gandhian reformers,
including Anasuyaben, in a strike by scavengers (Banghis) employed by
the municipality in the mid 1920s was something of an exception. In
1927, a union was set up to fight for better primary and secondary
working conditions for the city's scavengers. But this initiative was not
born out of a wish to expand the labour movement. It was a one-off
action, in which political rather than economic considerations played a
role. Gandhi's support for the Banghis was also grounded in his desire to
put a stop to their discrimination as untouchables. They had to make
their own contribution to this effort by purifying their ways and giving
up all unclean habits, such as drinking, smoking and eating meat.
Disciples of Gandhi in the TLA were also involved in setting up the
_Harijan Sevak Sangh_ in 1930, which aimed to improve the social
position of all untouchable castes. This initiative was in response to the
much more radical and militant attack by Ambedkar on the oppression
of the lowest castes in the Hindu hierarchy. When, during a visit to
Ahmedabad in 1928, he set up the Untouchable Welfare Organization,
it was not long before the Gandhians had founded their own organization
(Shah 1990: 573--4). A new opportunity to extend the TLA's
activities to the informal sector presented itself in 1972. A senior staff
member, Ela Bhatt, had discovered during the course of her social work
among the wives of mill workers that they did not need counselling on
how to run their households, but how to defend their own interests in
the context of the paid work they performed. In 1972, Elabehn was
given permission to set up a separate women's union within the TLA.
After almost ten years, she was told that her Self-Employed Women's
Association (SEWA) could no longer operate within the union. This
episode will be examined in greater detail in part two, but the message
was clear: the only target group the TLA recognized was the workers of
the industrial vanguard among the working population.

Did joining the union raise the mill workers' political awareness to a
higher level? If this was the case, it was certainly in spite of, rather than
thanks to, the teachings of the union leadership. The Gandhian reformers
inside and outside the Congress movement consciously chose not to
mobilize the workers in the struggle for national independence. They
were afraid that, once mobilized, this mass would demand a much more
radical programme on social redistribution than the nationalist leaders,
most of whom were of bourgeois origin, were prepared to pursue. The
introduction of universal suffrage was undoubtedly a major step forward
in the process of emancipation and meant that the working people were
more involved in the political system than ever before. But here too the
same rule applied as to the organizational structure of the union: indirect
representation by leaders who did not come from the working class. It
was the TLA leaders, armed with the mandate they had given themselves,
first at regional and then at national level, who laid the groundwork as
ministers and trade union politicians for the legislative framework of
industrial relations in late and post-colonial India. The arrival of workers
on the municipal council was inevitable but the candidates were screened
by the TLA for their loyalty and against other criteria until deep into the
second half of the twentieth century. The patronage structure inherent in
the union may have prevented the emergence of a political party based
on proletarian awareness, such as arose in South India in the first half of
the twentieth century and in the central Ganges plain of North India
toward its end (Varshney 2002: 245).

But there is another side which contradicts the view that the rank and
file of the union followed instructions from above obediently and
passively. Even in the authorized history of the union, which is very
triumphant in tone, it is clear that the members expressed their doubts,
mistrust, and protest against the leadership right from the founding of
the TLA and repeatedly in the decades that followed. Nor can it be
denied that certain segments of the working population were extremely
reluctant to join. This was particularly true of the Muslims who worked
in the weaving shops (Kamath and Kher 1993: 230). They believed that
the union gave greater priority to the interests of the spinners, who were
largely from the untouchable castes. But the fact that Muslims were
under-represented in the TLA membership appears to be equally a
consequence of the Hindu culture that had such a prominent symbolic
and practical place in the ideology of the TLA. When the majority of the
workers voted consistently for the Congress party after Independence,
this was not so much a response to the political advice of the TLA
leadership, but more a strategic choice. When Indulal Yagnik offered an
alternative that promised to deliver, in the eyes of this vote bank, what
those in power were not willing to concede, they massively turned to
him. But then again, when Yagnik's movement also failed to live up to
expectations, the voters returned to the Congress fold. But not to the
conservative branch of the party, which was still grounded in the old
Gandhian ideology. The mill workers found new hope in the mainstream
movement led by Indira Gandhi, which promised the lowincome
classes a better future. Yet, even this renewed fraction of the
Congress Party failed to hammer out a radical programme articulating
the emancipation of the low castes and other deprived groups.

The non-antagonistic approach that was the order of the day in the
TLA leadership undoubtedly brought great benefits for the members. At
the national level the Ahmedabad experiment was used as a model for the
formulation and implementation of industrial legislation in the postcolonial
era. In return for abandoning the class struggle and agreeing
only to strike as a last resort, the opposite camp also had to pay a price for
peaceful industrial relations. The status of the mill workers as a vanguard
of the working population was confirmed in a framework in which the
government not only saw to it that negotiations between employers and
employees were regulated and orderly, but also took an effective role as a
third party in the construction of industrial relations. The results of the
negotiations guaranteed the organized workers protection against arbitrary
dismissal and better terms and conditions of employment than the
unorganized mass of the working population in the informal sector.
Secondly, the industrial entrepreneurs had to accept the demand, expressed
early on by Gandhi, for a living wage for those hired to work in
the mills. This claim was operationalized in a dearness allowance as
compensation for the rising cost of living. The introduction of social
provisions, such as the Provident Fund and medical insurance (ESIS)
enhanced the dignity of the mill workers' lives. Judged from this perspective
it is quite clear that the political isolation into which the leaders of
the TLA had manoeuvred themselves by the end of the 1960s caused
great harm to the members when, in the decades that followed, the
textile industry went into progressive decay. The loss of political leverage,
at first in Ahmedabad and in the state of Gujarat, and later at national
level, led to less strict compliance with the industrial legislation that had
been put in place as a result of the righteous struggle. This fatal consequence
will be considered in greater detail in the following chapter.

The argument put forward above contradicts the suggestion that the
workers belonging the TLA had been docile in following the union
leadership. They were explicitly not mobilized on the basis of their
working class solidarity. The statement at the end of the first chapter
merits repetition: the employers' organization, which had already been
set up well before the end of the nineteenth century, did not try to
prevent the founding of the union in the aftermath of the First World
War, when industrial agitation became a serious problem also in
Ahmedabad, but had in fact welcomed it heartily. Ambalal Sarabhai,
Anasuyaben's brother and President of the AMA, proposed to its members
in 1920:

> ... to agree to the establishment of craft-wise organisations of workers in mills of
Ahmedabad so as to make it easier to negotiate with them and also to agree to
refer disputes not solved by negotiations with workers' organisations to a board
of arbitration. (Majmundar 1973:82)

And so it happened. The division of the workers into craft-based unions
led to a federative structure and system of representation founded on
separate categories rather than uniform interests. Was this policy of
segmentation deliberate on the part of the TLA to keep the membership
divided? One obvious way of refuting this suggestion is the argument
that the union leaders were simply continuing an existing practice. After
all, newcomers to the mill were put to work in departments on the basis
of their social identities, which remained divided on the workfloor. The
spinning shops, together with the very dusty and dirty departments
where the raw cotton was delivered and stored, were the domain of the
untouchable castes. The fact that they were allowed access to formal
sector employment at all was initially enough to satisfy their aspirations.
Once they had found their niche in the mill, however, they became
discontented at being excluded from cleaner and better-paid work.
Muslims made themselves available as weavers from an early stage. This
was perhaps because earlier generations had worked as weavers at home
or in small ateliers before the first textile mills were set up in the city. In
this way, the segmented recruitment of workers reflected past practice.
The departments where the still unworked product was further processed
and finished largely employed members of the middle and higher
castes. In this way, the division of tasks in the mills closely, if not entirely,
followed the hierarchy of the caste system. Questioned about the organization
of work within the mill along caste lines, those at the bottom were
very much aware why they remained stuck there.

>That is an age-old issue. There is an unwritten rule that _Vankars_ (SCs) are to be
employed only in the spinning departments, Muslims in the weaving departments,
and _Patels_ and _Amins_ (upper castes) in the cloth and processing departments.
It has been like this from the very beginning. This is what I have heard.
They have been exploiting the _Dalits_ and will continue to do so; they leave no
stone unturned in unleashing injustice on the _Dalits_. We succumb to this
helplessly because there is no other go. Exploitation or not, we get our bread and
butter from the mill; otherwise our sisters and daughters would have to go into
prostitution. (Quoted in Ramanathan 2003: 5)

Masihi's study in the mid 1970s revealed that a considerable proportion
of the mill workers were not only members of a trade union but also of
a caste association. For the TLA this applied to four out of every ten
members, a much higher percentage than for the smaller unions (Masihi
1985: 134). It indicates that the textile workers not only derived their
identities from the jobs they did, but also remained firmly embedded in
the milieu from which they originated, determined by caste or religion.
Both on the workfloor and in the neighbourhoods, primordial loyalties
played an important role. In his study on the emergence of industrial
capitalism in India, Chandavarkar stated that 'within the arena of the
neighbourhoods solidarities within the working class were forged as well
as fragmented' (Chandavarkar 1992: 238). My own view concurs with
that of Chandavarkar entirely. Class and religion/caste were both organizing
principles for positioning in the socio-economic order. The relation
between the two is equivalent to that described earlier between
homogeneity and heterogeneity. It is not a question of one or the other,
but of the interaction between them. This results in multiple profiles
which determine the dynamics of individual and collective action.

Having said this, it must also be made clear that, from beginning to
end, the leadership of the TLA showed a systematic preference for the
second at the expense of the first. Put another way, the union bosses
advocated a vertical rather than a horizontal orientation among their
members. Masihi described this approach as follows:

>The TLA has remained a conservative trade union working on Gandhian line.
Here, various caste associations of _Vaghris_, _Thakors_, and scheduled castes are
encouraged with a view to improving their life. The emphasis, as some of the
respondents pointed out, is to bring about gradual change among their own
community. But the whole approach tends to strengthen narrow loyalties of the
workers at the cost of solidarity of working class. (Masihi 1985: 196)

The author not only presented his own views but also expressed those of
practically all his respondents. When asked if it was the task of a trade
union 'to remove caste and communal differences from the workers and
arouse in them a class consciousness', 90% answered in the
affirmative. Interestingly enough, the TLA members scored the highest.
I would like to note here that it would be incorrect to classify a 'class'
orientation as modern and a 'caste' one as traditional. In both cases, they
are identities which were formed by their inclusion in the industrial
labour process. Joining a caste association or a religious sect did not
represent a desire to hold on to an identity from the past, any more than
joining a union signalled a willingness to engage in collective action
articulating present and future class consciousness. Contrary to the idea
that caste and religious bonds were carried over from the pre-industrial
past, as Chakrabarty has argued for the Calcutta mill workers, I tend to
agree with Gooptu's criticism of this line of thought. To accept that the
new industrial proletariat that emerged in colonial India was characterized
by 'a communal sense of identity and honour'. should not necessarily
lead us to assume that these mentalities were the outcome of
pre-bourgeois or pre-capitalist notions of community (Gooptu 2001:
186--9).[^/8/4]

The reinforcement by the Gandhian leadership of loyalties based on
caste and religion did not have a counter-productive impact across the
board. By taking action at an early stage against the denigration and
discrimination of untouchable castes, the TLA paved the way for the
later programme of positive discrimination. The facilities provided under
this programme made it possible for the children of mill workers
from the lower castes to obtain public sector jobs that would otherwise
have remained beyond their reach. It is interesting in this context that
many mill owners supported in the early 1930s the foundation of the
_Sanatan Varnashram Samrakshaka Sabha_, an orthodox association which
opposed Gandhi's reforms of the caste system head-on and whose
members came largely from the city elite (Shah 1990: 574). Although
the Gandhian union pursued a policy of positive discrimination with
respect to _Harijans_ (children of God), it displayed a certain reticence
towards Muslims. This was fuelled, as mentioned above, by a tendency
among Muslims themselves --- more so than among Hindus --- not to join
the TLA. As a result, this religious minority was in a vulnerable position,
which was expressed in a less active representation of their interests. In
addition, there are indications that the proportion of Muslims in the
working population of the mills, in 1945 almost 30% (Patel n.d.:123), fell dramatically in the post-colonial period. There are, however,
no accurate figures to support this suspected trend towards
marginalization. From conversations with Muslim informants during
my fieldwork at the end of the 1990s, I was able to conclude that this
category of employees had been subject to a gradual process of replacement,
which contrasted sharply with the sudden expulsion of women
from the mills. Patel describes this gradual shift in the social composition
of the workforce in an unpublished report on the communal riots in
Ahmedabad in 1985--6.

[^/8/4]: Chitra Joshi has reached a similar conclusion in her study on the social history of the
workforce in the textile mills of Kanpur (2003: 107--8 and chapter 7).


>After 1940s, a conscious attempt was made to stop recruiting Muslims in the
textile mills. By that time the proportion of migrant Muslims was high, the
Ahmedabad-based weaver community switching to service jobs, like posts and
telephones. (Patel n.d.: 124)

In a footnote the author added that, at the time of her study in the early
1980s, Muslims constituted a significant part of the total number of
weavers in only nine mills in the city. Their place seems to have been
taken largely by middle castes, and in particular the _Patel Patidars_ from
North Gujarat and Saurashtra. This is an upwardly mobile caste of rural
origin, the members of which increasingly settled in Ahmedabad, where
they continued their climb up the ladder, both in the economy and in the
caste hierarchy. Masihi also observed the growing importance of the
_Patidars_ among the factory workers with a Hindu identity. Most of the
members of the TLA were from the untouchable castes, but immediately
after them came the _Patidars_ (Masihi 1985: 67).

The restructuring of the mill population, with fewer Muslims and
more members of the middle and higher castes, was the result of a strong
preference on the part of the industrial entrepreneurs, most of whom
were orthodox Hindus, for a more homogeneous culture in the mills,
which no longer provided space for workers from the religious minority.
The union leaders did not seem to have opposed them strongly in this
respect. The consequences were visible in the wavering stance of the TLA
leadership on fundamental social principles. The emphasis on loyalties to
caste and religion, and to Hinduism in particular, did much to erode
the feelings of solidarity between the various social groups. Political
mobilization along communal lines emphasized the differences. Towards
the end of the twentieth century, these differences erupted into violence
in the industrial neighbourhoods on several occasions. Initially, the low
castes were the focus of the campaign pursued by the higher castes
against the policy of positive discrimination. In the next round, the low
castes were called upon to join together with the other castes under the
Hindu banner and cast out 'the enemy in our midst'. Such fundamentalist
views had surfaced on earlier occasions. There is every reason to
respond critically to suggestions that Gandhi's doctrine of reconciliation
and non-violence was an expression of attitudes that were widely held in
Gujarat society. This pretension ignores the fact that the ideas that
Gandhi deployed in the struggle for national independence were seen as
dangerous by political Hinduism. Condemning the explosion of communal
hatred in early 2002, A.M. Shah recalls from memory how the
opponents of religious tolerance and plurality were already active half a
century ago.

>Even before Independence there was some presence of RSS and the sympathisers
of the ideology of Hindutva in Gujarat. I recall how at the time of Gandhi's
assassination this group distributed sweets in Baroda. There were some supporters
of this ideology even among professors in Baroda College. The ideology
spread slowly but steadily after Partition, and with the emergence of the BJP,
VHP, Bajrang Dal and Shiv Sena-although Shiv Sena is based in Maharashtra,
it has quite a few branches in Gujarat-the ideology spread rapidly and widely.
(A.S. Shah 2002: 59).

The unrest that broke out regularly, between high and low castes, or
between members of the religious majority and minority, cannot be seen
in isolation from the ideological breeding ground which the TLA leaders
had tried to overcome in the context of the righteous struggle. The
second half of this study examines this dramatic process in greater detail,
against the background of the crisis in the textile industry and the
ensuing mass redundancies. During the communal riots in 1941 and
again in 1946, the TLA had managed to prevent its segmented membership
from becoming involved. Khandubhai Desai, one of the leaders of
the union, spoke proudly of their refusal to start fighting each other in
the streets on the basis of primordial sentiments.

>The (TLA's) broader outlook and its practice in day-to-day activity is responsible
to a very large extent for keeping peace among the working class when the
communal sentiments are running very high throughout the country. ...
Ahmedabad's working class has been saved from the communal fury even when
the city was afflicted by this disease more than once. (K. Desai 1948: 15)

A few decades later, when the Manchester of India started to become
history this feat was no longer possible.
