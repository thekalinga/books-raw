## Informality as a Regime of Exploitation and Marginalization

### A Reserve Army

In the preceding chapter I concluded that the distinction between
employment and unemployment is grounded in an analysis which has
no validity beyond the formal sector of the economy. Within the setting
of the informal sector, reality is far too complex to be considered in terms
of this simple duality. The assertion in various publications that, despite
the collapse of the large-scale textile industry in Ahmedabad, the percentage
of open unemployment[^15/1] remained unchanged at the low level of
two to three %, denies the perception of the great majority of
informal sector workers, based on their daily experience, that there is a
severe and sustained shortage of work. The popular claim that the poor
are too poor to allow themselves to be unemployed testifies to a very
superficial understanding of the sometimes intermittent and sometimes
sustained shortage of work confronting these people. The concept of
underemployment can of course help to fill the twilight zone in quantitative
terms between searching for and finding subsidiary work. Yet this
contrast too falls short in the attempt to apply methods used in the
formal sector to the situation in the informal sector. Ghose, who appears
to recognize this problem, notes that:

> ... many people, particularly women, are reluctant to admit to seeking paid work
when they know such work to be unavailable: but they would in fact be quite
willing to accept such work if and when available. For this reason, it is appropriate
(though not strictly accurate) to regard subsidiary workers as discouraged
workers rather than as non-workers; _it is wrong to regard them either as employed
or as being outside the labour force_ \[my italics\]. (Ghose 1999: 2599)

[^15/1]: Defined as usual as 'not working but seeking or available for work during the major
part of the reference period'.


Ghose goes on to conclude that many people who are counted as
employed are actually substantially underemployed. In his opinion, this
is a characteristic feature of an economy in which self-employment and
casual wage employment are of disproportionate importance. Backed up
by the anthropological part of my empirical studies in Ahmedabad, I am
in complete agreement with this point of view. The previously mentioned
claim by Dutta and Batley, based on comparison of data from
successive NSS rounds, that the rate of underemployment in Ahmedabad
significantly declined between 1987--88 and 1993--94, seems to be
grounded more in wishful thinking than careful investigation. The
quantitative evidence for making this claim is in any case extremely
disputable (Dutta and Batley 1999: 24--25) and there is no shortage of
case studies to support a trend to the contrary. Homeworkers, for
example, complain about a considerable decrease in the number of
working days as a direct result of the influx of large numbers of women
onto the labour market since the mill closures. Ghose believes that this is
a more general trend, explicitly contradicting economists with more
optimistic views (see Ghose 1999: 2600).

In addition to workers in regular paid jobs, the self-employed and
casual day labourers also fail to exploit their labour power to its full
potential. Few of them succeed in working more than 20 days a month.
This led me to ask them about their monthly income, as opposed to what
they earned on a daily basis. Street vendors seem to be the most
susceptible to seasonal fluctuations, which prevent them from achieving
a fixed rhythm of work. On days when it is raining, cold, or very hot,
there is less demand for their services and they have to take account of a
considerable drop in income. Daily wageworkers are similarly affected.
On such days, they will go to the various labour markets in the city where
workers are hired early in the morning, only to be turned away. It is the
same story at the building sites, where they seek work as unskilled hands.
It would, however, be incorrect to attribute the unpredictable nature of
work in the open air purely to inclement weather. It may also be
interrupted by holidays, or by disturbances of the public order, such as
riots or political turmoil. Seasonal swings in the city's economy, caused
by the complex configuration of industrial and commercial capital flows
in the informal sector, have a greater impact on the mass of workers in
this sector than on their counterparts in the better-regulated formal
sector. There is, however, little detailed research into the nature and
effects of these cyclical and erratic trends. This also affects homeworkers,
whose way of earning a living is completely concealed from public view.
The fact that they are apparently available for work at all times does not
mean that they have work all the time. The delivery of raw materials is
irregular, the power supply is unreliable, and (sub)contractors pass on
fluctuations in demand for the end product without the slightest scruples.

To escape the harmful consequences of working in the informal
sector, most of those exposed to this regime adopt a variety of strategies
designed to increase the yield of their labour power. The first option is to
work longer hours. Contrary to the provisions of the minimum wage
legislation, those who earn a living in the manufacturing workshops have
to work for much longer than eight hours a day. With hardly a break,
they are made to work an extra half a day or longer. This is, of course,
because the employer demands it. But it is also a form of self-exploitation
resulting from the work being paid on piecemeal basis. The workers force
themselves to work more and more and jump at the chance to work the
following shift too if someone in that batch does not turn up. Street
vendors and daily-wage labourers also alternate between days when they
have nothing or very little to do and days when they work ceaselessly
from early in the morning to late at night, and sometimes deep into the
night. Others work longer hours in an attempt to supplement what they
consider their main occupation with a secondary source of income which
involves fewer hours or is irregular. Reports suggesting that subsidiary
activities are uncommon in the informal sector --- according to Unni,
occupational multiplicity was limited to less than 3% of her
sample population, drawn from the economically active population in
Ahmedabad (Unni 2000: 28) --- testify to a serious underestimation of
the need for workers to seek additional sources of income to ensure that
they earn the minimum required to meet the costs of daily subsistence.

Yet another way of alleviating the pressure to earn enough to survive
is to involve dependent members of the household in the labour process.
These are, in the first instance, the women.[^15/2] This is the real reason ---
rather than the supposed favourable effect of the informalization policy
on employment in the informal sector --- for their increased workforce
participation rate after the mass redundancies of mostly men from the
textile mills. In other words, the workforce expansion is supply rather
than demand driven. The fact that women and children are forced to
make use of their as yet unpaid labour power, both in and outside the
home, increases the economic support base of the household as the
primary social formation. The difference between women and children is
that, whereas the former can take on a full workload, the children tend to
be used as reserve labour. In this way, in terms of the nature of the work,
the modality of employment, and the method of payment, the trend
towards informalization has penetrated into the sphere of the family.

[^15/2]: The progressive participation of women in paid work is well documented. See
Hirway and Unni 1990; Jhabvala and Bali n.d.; Jhabvala and Shaikh n.d.; Mahadevia and
D'Costa 1997: 34--35; Mahadevia 1998: 522--25; _idem_ 2001: 151--55; Unni 2000: 22--23;
Unni and Bali 2001, and elsewhere.


Those who believe that the increased workforce participation rate is
the result of expansion of employment opportunities present as evidence
not only the low level of unemployment but also the rise in the level of
real wages of flexibilized labour. The inaccuracy of the first argument has
already been discussed. In opposition to those who argue, on the basis of
the NSS data already criticized above, that the labour of informal sector
workers increased in value after the introduction of the new economic
policy (Dutta and Batley 1999: 26; _see also_ Sundaram 2001: 940), there
are others who hold that the real wages of informal sector workers in
Gujarat and in Ahmedabad have stagnated at extremely low levels (Unni
2001a: 2373; Mahadevia 2001: 156).

Those who advocate that dismantling of the dualistic structure of the
labour market was a necessary precondition for improving the position
of informal sector workers support their argument with statistics which
provide an incomplete and distorted view of the work and life of a large
part of the population of Ahmedabad at the end of twentieth century.
My own analysis can be summarized in a number of main points.

First, the informalization process has not fostered the growth of
employment in the sense that supporters of this policy suggest. For the
large majority of households which no longer enjoy the protection of
formal sector employment --- now restricted to approximately one fifth to
one sixth of the total workforce --- living standards have deteriorated in a
real sense since they were forced into the informal sector. Their arrival
only exacerbated the already vulnerable situation of the much greater
part of the working population who were already active in the informal
sector. The owners of capital are encouraged to make use of labour in a
way that reduces its quality to the lowest possible level.

Second, this heterogeneous mass --- divided into a number of main
categories (own-account workers and regular or casual labourers) --- at
the base of the urban economy is underemployed in a way that remains
underexposed in conventional statistics. The large majority is unable to
make full use of its labour power for more than 20 full days a month on
average, with extremes that extend far below this figure.

Third, what the majority of them have in common is the extremely
low pay they receive for the work they do, and for a form of employment
that takes no account of the time it entails and in which a significant part
of the employers' risk is borne by the workers.

Fourth, to an even greater extent than before the introduction of the
new economic policy, the government has decided not to monitor
compliance with the minimum wage legislation. This legislation was
introduced several decades ago for many branches of informal economic
activity, albeit at a level that was invariably fixed below the poverty line.

Lastly, underemployment combined with underpayment results in an
unpredictable pattern of curtailed or, conversely, prolonged working
hours, in which the involvement of dependent members of the household
in paid work also has to be taken into account. To explain these
phenomena as indications of a growth in employment displays a manifest
denial of the misery that underlies this economic strategy.

In my account, the flexibilized working population which dominates
the city economy has the characteristics of a floating reserve army. Whole
contingents are hired and fired by industrial and commercial capital
according to the dictates of the moment. As a result, in the daily struggle
to survive, this marginalized mass is condemned to perpetual mobility in
the search for work, both within and between sectors and between
modes of employment. Confined in their status of reserve labour, it is
inevitable that this most vulnerable segment of the economically active
population maintains its own reserve --- the dependent members of their
households. Out of public view, it is usually the weakest and smallest
shoulders that have to bear the heaviest burdens of informalization. The
image of shared poverty does not do justice to the inequality with which
this form of existence, too, is permeated within the sphere of the
household.

### Immiserization of the Labouring Poor

Due to the lack of reliable workforce censuses, I am still unable to figure
out with any accuracy the scale and intensity of poverty in Ahmedabad.
It will come as no surprise that, in my opinion, the percentage of the
population living below the poverty line is much greater than that
assumed by researchers who base their calculations on the figures from
the National Sample Surveys. Unni has calculated how much an informal
sector worker would earn with a daily wage of 52 rupees and at 26
working days a month shortly before the turn of the century. This is
taken as the amount required to enable the worker concerned and two
dependent members of the household to remain above the poverty line
as officially determined in 1998. On the basis of two working members
of the household and accepting that the yield from child labour is often
included in the income of the adults, this would amount to a little over
100 rupees a day for an average household. Assuming 312 working days
a year (12 full working months of 26 days), it would mean an annual
income of around 32,500 rupees. This is indeed above the 25,000-rupee
level considered by Dutta and Batley as the upper limit for the lowest
income group. However, with Unni's much more realistic estimate of
250 (12x20) working days a year, the annual household income falls
much closer to or actually within this lowest income bracket. And that is
not the end of the story. Unni's research shows that, in 1998, the real
daily wage for informal sector workers lay at least 10% (for men)
and 33% (for women) below the poverty line. The annual income
that this lower figure produces for a household with two working
members (a man and a woman), based on 20 working days a month,
amounted to some 16,800 rupees, two-thirds of the amount established
by Dutta and Batley as the poverty line. When calculated in this way, the
claim based on the NSS statistics that less than a tenth of the population
falls into the lowest income group can no longer be accepted. The wage
of 47 rupees for men and 37 rupees for women which Unni refers to for
1998 (and which is confirmed by my own findings) applied to the
average informal sector worker, that is to the large majority of the
working population. Even more alarming are the figures quoted by Joshi
for the inhabitants of a slum on, the banks of the river that divides the city
in two. Of the 7,512 households he studied in 1998, the monthly
income of around 57% was below 1,000 rupees, and of 35% between 1,000 and 2,000 rupees. Only 6% had an income of
between 2,000 and 3,000 rupees.

My findings refute the position that, since (and as a result of) the
reforms in the labour market, poverty in Ahmedabad has been reduced
to not more than a residual category. I tend towards the opposite
conclusion --- that the flexibilization of employment has worsened rather
than improved the economic situation of a substantial part of the
working population. The National Center for Labour (NCL) calculated
for 1996 that, for a reasonable level of subsistence and based on a normal
working week, a worker would have to earn a daily wage of 125 rupees.
At that time, the greatest part of the informal sector workers came
nowhere near this level of income, even if they mobilized all the potential
labour power in the household.

By no means do I wish to argue that poverty remained at a constantly
high level over a long period of time. Repeated fieldwork based studies
which I have carried out from the early 1960s onwards in rural south
Gujarat lead me to the conclusion that, especially in the 1970s and
1980s, there was a reduction in the incidence of poverty in the state's
rural economy. Improvements in communications and transport played
a prominent role in the progress in which the landpoor and landless
segments of the population also shared during this period. The trend
towards technological modernization facilitated the escape of the rural
underclass from the system of agrarian bondage that characterized the
ancien regime. The widening and deepening of the labour market made
it easier to leave the villages and the urban economy came within reach
for many more people than before (see _e.g._ Breman 1996). Schemes in
those years introduced by the state government, largely for electoral
reasons, to tackle poverty helped to widen the socio-economic space and
created more room for manoeuvre. In the course of my rural fieldwork in
this period I was able to observe the beneficial effects of some of these
programmes. Infrastructural works increased the demand for labour and
the resulting diversification of employment led to an increase in real
wages for rural labourers. Credit enabled small landowners to raise their
productivity, as a result of which the members of self-cultivating households
no longer or less frequently had to hire themselves out as labourers
and dependent members of these households increasingly opted out
from the hunt for paid work. Cheap grain through the public food
distribution programme ensured that the higher levels of income were
not completely offset by an immediate increase in the cost of basic
necessities. The noon meal schemes, which were introduced to encourage
children from illiterate households to go to school, had the same
effect. The criticism aimed at these initiatives at the time was undoubtedly
justified, but their favourable impact on the material and nonmaterial
condition of the landpoor and the landless classes must not be
underestimated.

The transition to the policy of structural adjustment from the late
1980s onwards meant that funds for most of these programmes were no
longer available or were considerably reduced. Attempts to improve the
relative position of deprived groups through additional support measures
were abandoned. The new strategy was based on the belief that the
advancement of economic growth offered a less costly, more effective,
and faster way of reducing the incidence of poverty. The leap forward in
its Net State Domestic Product made by Gujarat during the last decade
of the twentieth century is above the average for the country as a whole
and applies particularly to the industrial-urban sector of the economy.
The accelerated decrease in the incidence of poverty between 1987--88
and 1993--94, already mentioned above, may also seem to contradict my
conclusion that the income of most households in Ahmedabad depending
on employment in the informal sector is far below the level needed
for a standard of living above the poverty line. This contradiction in
interpretation acquires even more significance if other aspects relating to
the quality of life are taken into account. The measurement of poverty
should not remain limited to the quantification of income but needs to
be defined in qualitative terms as well. One important observation is that
the reforms in economic policy, as in many other Indian states, resulted
in considerable cutbacks in expenditure in the social sector (including on
education and health care). Hirway and Mahadevia point out that the
conversion of economic growth into human development has received
scant attention from the Gujarat government. The percentage of the
budget allocated to basic education, public health care, sanitation,
nutrition, and drinking water supply remains below the national average.
The implementation of the structural adjustment programme did
not lead to any real improvement in this unfavourable track record and
the authors speak of a lack of political will to alleviate the accumulated
deprivation (Hirway and Mahadevia 2000: 203).

The picture that emerges from this is confirmed, as far as Ahmedabad
is concerned, by the sprawling slums. A major segment of the city's
population lives cramped together in these deprived neighbourhoods,
exposed to extreme pollution and excluded from the most elementary
civic amenities. The situation in the slum described by Joshi in 1998 is
certainly not exceptional and is confirmed by other reports.

>remaining 45% in pucca houses. Their water supply and sanitation

>led to skin diseases and stomach ailments (VIKAS 1996).

Various studies link living in a slum to working in informal sector
conditions. The lack of access to public services which the better-off
segments of the population take for granted is closely related to an
employment regime that offers little or no protection against the power
of capital. This can be illustrated by an interesting study conducted in
the early 1990s as part of an investigation by local non-governmental
agencies to determine the effects of structural adjustment on the urban
poor. The commissioned report compared the level of education and
health care of households in a neighbourhood inhabited by potters on
the outskirts of Ahmedabad with that of workers in the textile mills
residing in the industrial localities. The mill workers had a regular job in
the formal sector and enjoyed all the privileges of the legal protection and
security provided by this form of employment. One important difference
was that, although the average family size was almost the same, the
number of dependent household members was much smaller in the
milieu of the potters. In the households of the textile workers, the
women and children were usually relieved of the obligation to do paid
work. The mill workers earned four times as much as the potters were
individually able to make, a difference that reflected the much higher
level of training and the more regular mode of payment in the textile
industry. The striking disparity in literacy between the two groups
repeated itself in the younger generation. While the children of the mill
workers, both girls and boys, usually went on to secondary school, this
was uncommon among the potters because the children had to contribute
to the household income from an early age. There was a similar
contrast in the area of health. The families of the mill workers had a
higher life expectancy and were covered against ill health by their
membership of the public health insurance scheme. At the end of her
case study the researcher concluded that creating low-pay employment
without social services was an insufficient method of tackling poverty
(Mahadevia a.o. 1994: 389). I would add here that the former mill
workers now find themselves in the same position as potters were at the
time of Mahadevia's study.

Does this imply that life in the informal sector always and inevitably
means a life of poverty? Excluded from this state of deprivation, are in
the first place, all those who do not belong to the subaltern classes in the
urban economy. Own account workers may very well be highly trained
professionals such as chartered accountants, lawyers, and doctors with
high incomes. Also white-collar employees in private business are often
appointed to staff positions without being protected by tenured work
contracts. Both their educational qualifications and their salary level
exempt them from the kind of precarious livelihood associated with the
large majority of the informal sector workforce. Focussing on this
fragmented mass embedded in the lower economic echelons, I tend to
agree with Mahadevia's estimate that two-thirds of the families which
constitute this enormous reserve army of Ahmedabad are living in
poverty (Mahadevia 2001: 156). Who, then, succeed in extricating
themselves from the generally prevailing misery? Among this more
fortunate minority I certainly include the bosses, contractors and subcontractors,
supervisors, jobbers, moneylenders and pawnbrokers, commission
agents and other brokers who exploit the cheap labour power of
the informal sector workers for their own gain. All these figures too are
embedded in this milieu, and they act as intermediaries in the flow of
profits realized from the sale of aggregated labour power (for example, by
contracting work gangs) or from putting-out work performed (for
example, to homeworkers). Their mediation extends --- broken up in
various steps --- to the formal sector economy. Positioned close to the
source, they claim for themselves a significant part of the surplus value
generated by exploiting the army of casualized labour. It is difficult for
outsiders to ascertain exactly how much they earn, but it is usually far
more than the wages earned by the lowest category of formal sector
workers.

Other households in a relatively favourable position are those where
there are no longer young children to be cared for, but where the adults
have not yet reached the age at which they can no longer work. The
heterogeneity of the informal sector milieu applies not only between
categories but is also expressed through strong fluctuations in time
within categories. During the most productive period for a household
which --- as long as those involved remain in reasonable health and are
neither too young nor too oldmay last for a cycle lasting ten to fifteen
years, the labour power of most if not all members is used to the
maximum. In 1998, the total income from employment in such households
could amount to 3,000 or even 4,000 rupees a month. In such
cases, income poverty may no longer be the most pressing problem, but
this does not change the fact that deprivation in all other respects
remains a major feature of the lifestyle of these households.

Among those who manage to survive above the poverty line are also
those who do not have to rely solely on the sale of their low or unskilled
labour power. These include the owners of petty means of production ---
such as motorized rickshaws, handcarts, or street stalls --- or parcels of
land or small buildings in the slum areas, who not only use this property
themselves but rent or lease it out. In his recent study, so highly praised
by politicians and policy-makers, de Soto paints a glorious picture both
of the volume of capital in the informal sector and the extent to which it
is distributed among the masses at the base of the economy (de Soto 2000).[^15/3] This does not change the fact that the informal sector segment
that has access to such forms of minor property, particularly in the
context of south Asia, happens to be in a more favourable position than
the much higher percentage of households that are completely or largely
excluded from owning means of production themselves.

Lastly there is another source of income for people in the informal
sector milieu which gives a small percentage of the households a larger
budget than would appear in any survey-based studies: a wide range of
extra-legal or out and out criminal activities. Such activities are obviously
not restricted to the informal sector, but are also the order in the higher
economic circuit. The lack of quantitative study of such activities is
naturally related to the fact that responses may not be reliable and that
there is insufficient knowledge to determine the extent to which they
might be unreliable or incomplete. This is unfortunate, but there are
many widely varying phenomena whose level of reality cannot be determined
only in the accuracy with which they can be measured.

[^15/3]: For a critical review see Breman 2001b.


The well-known paper dating back to 1971 with which Hart focused
attention on the informal sector problem, made a primary distinction
between legitimate and illegitimate activities (Hart 1973: 67). During
my fieldwork in Ahmedabad I kept an account of all the different sources
of income he included in the latter category. They can be clustered into
a number of activities: theft (burglary and pickpocketing) and fencing;
robbery and extortion (ranging from the threat of physical violence to
less serious forms of intimidation); informal moneylending and pawnbroking;
fraud and bribery (or being an accessory to bribery, including
the selling of real or false permits, diplomas or driving licences, evading
the payment of fines for unauthorized use of, for instance, the electricity
supply or preventing the confiscation of means of production or merchandise);
distilling and smuggling liquor; trading in weapons or drugs;
gambling and banned games of chance; the prostitution of women and
children as well as touting for them and; finally, the use of violence
against persons for payment (D'Costa 2002: 351, 364). The distinction
made between self-employment and casual or regular wage labour also
applies to all these activities. Those working on their own account and at
their own risk may combine this with membership of gangs hired on a
regular or incidental basis by landlords and slum bosses to drive out
squatters, by politicians to intimidate opponents or to persecute minorities,
or to even settle scores between criminals themselves. The scale of
the work provided and the income generated in this way should not be
underestimated in an economy where more than half the total money
circulation takes place outside the legal-administrative purview. The
revenue from criminal activities permits the more professional practitioners
to enjoy a lifestyle that may not be very comfortable, given the risks
involved, but is certainly better than living on or below the poverty line.
Fired mill workers expressed fears, and for good reason, that their sons ---
who, like them, are forced to live at a much lower level of subsistence ---
would succumb to the temptation of the easy pickings offered by a life of
crime (Engineer 1985a and 1985 b).

The link between illegality and informality has been made before.
This applies not only to the way crime exploits labour but equally, or
perhaps even more so, to the way in which non-legal financial transactions
are used in an attempt to evade legal permits and bans. One-sided
admiration for the power of the entrepreneurial capacity that functions
as the motor of the renewed urban economy denies the criminal nature
of a not insignificant part of it. Spodek passes clear judgment on the
practices that have become common with the informalization of capital
in Ahmedabad:

>Crime, particularly economic crime, had become a way of life in Ahmedabad.
Economic pressures were such that honest compliance with the law had become
difficult. The consequences for the city both in lack of funds and in extraordinary
cynicism were devastating. So great was the shortfall in collection that
before 1994 Ahmedabad was almost insolvent. Social capital declined in tandem.
(Spodek 2001: 1632)

Land speculators and slumlords have added to the criminalization of
local level politics. While surveying the large range of illegitimate activities
it should not be forgotten that informal sector workers are not only
the hunters but also the hunted. The fact that, for most households, their
total earned income remains below the poverty line does not mean that
they are exempt from all kinds of illegal levies. These include raids from
the formal sector to relieve such easy prey of a part of their income. Here,
too, numbers and figures are mere guesswork and cannot really express
the nature and scale of these levies. And this is by no means the only facet
of the 'hidden economy' which is underexposed in statistics on which
viewpoints are based which testify to an explicit formal sector bias.

### The Measurement of Poverty

The much greater incidence, intensity, and heterogeneity in the poverty
situation of the army of informal sector workers in Ahmedabad which I
perceive can partly be attributed to methodological differences between
studies with a more quantitative approach and those that are more
qualitative in nature. This same distinction also occurs in a slightly
different manner in the contradictory views often expressed in macro as
against micro studies. I participated in a conference on this theme in
1985 at which economists and statisticians engaged in debate with
anthropologists and sociologists on disciplinary similarities and differences
in the measurement of rural poverty in India.[^15/4] The meeting was organized
in response to the striking contrast between the picture presented
in the early 1980s by the National Sample Survey (NSS) data suggesting
wide-scale rural impoverishment and the comparatively much more
hopeful case studies of the economic dynamics produced by local-level
researchers, including those engaged in anthropological fieldwork. As
convenor, Bardhan expressed his satisfaction that the interaction had
helped to increase understanding in both camps of the limitations of
standard research methods in the respective disciplines. His appeal not
only to focus on each other's substantive findings but also to become
better acquainted with different research techniques for trying to unravel
reality deserves to be endorsed but does not seem to have enjoyed much
follow-up. The same division appears to be emerging once again, only
this time the economists are interpreting the NSS figures to show an
acceleration in the reduction of poverty, especially in the urban economy
while, on the other hand, most anthropological reports do not share that
optimistic judgement. Case studies and return visits to the same locations
of research over time like those I conducted in south Gujarat, with
a strong local focus and not primarily aimed at generating large data
bases to be processed in statistical form, provide no confirmation of what
macro studies see as an encouraging development in the right direction.
In line with what one of the participants at the above mentioned workshop
called the ideology of measurement', I am sceptical about a method
of quantification based on registration techniques with a formal sector
bias and which are insufficiently adapted to the concrete situation we are
addressing: life and work in a state of poverty. Unni had the following to
say on this matter in a recent publication:

>The current methods of data collection and concepts used in the population
census and labour force surveys are inadequate to track the growing informalisation
of the labour force. Work, which is increasingly being pushed into informal work
situations, requires more innovative methods to capture in official data collection
efforts. (Unni 2000: 63)

[^15/4]: The workshop, sponsored by the Social Science Research Council in New York in
collaboration with the Indian Statistical Institute, was entitled 'Rural Economic Change
in South Asia: Differences in Approach and in Results between Large-Scale Surveys and
Intensive Micro Studies'. For a summary of the discussion see the introduction to the
published proceedings, edited by Bardhan (1989), which include contributions by most
of the participants.

Hirway has raised similar criticisms and concludes that NSS concepts
and methods are not able to capture satisfactorily informal sector work
(Hirway 2002: 85--6). The _modus operandi_ of these two economists
who have long-standing experience with empirical and quantified research
in the lower echelons of the urban and rural economy in various
regional settings testify to a level of detail and nuance that is far superior
to the rather mechanistic approach followed by NSS field rapporteurs.

One aspect of the measurement of poverty that requires further
discussion is the share of their income that people have to spend on other
things than just food, such as housing, clothing, health care, and education.
The convenient assumption that non-food expenses accounts for
about 20--30% of income is rarely tested on the basis of a
thorough and long-term analysis of the budgets of a relatively large
group of households which are sufficiently different in composition.
Statistics are usually aimed at establishing what people require to stay
above the poverty line and insufficient account is taken of the real, often
widely fluctuating and opaque patterns of expenditure of the significant
part of the population that live beneath it. In addition, all kinds of
overhead costs related to such a situation of deprivation are not taken
into consideration.

What must also not be negated is the pressure to suggest that, because
certain forms of data are not collected, that the scale, nature and
dynamics of poverty are not as bad as postulated. In contrast to the
equally biased tendency to claim that poverty persists unabated or is even
getting worse --- with the all too simple slogan 'the rich get richer and the
poor get poorer' --- there is the converse distortion of reality that demonstrates
a conscious or unconscious blindness regarding the exposure of
certain facets of poverty. Drèze and Sen's comments are relevant in this
respect:

> ... the justification for focusing on outputs and incomes lies ultimately in the
impact that their augmentation may have on the freedoms that people actually
enjoy to lead the kind of lives they have reason to value. The analysis of economic
development must take note of both the causal connections, and also of other
policies and institutional changes that contribute to the enhancement of human
capabilities. The success of development programmes cannot be judged merely
in terms of their effects on incomes and outputs, and must, at a basic level, focus
on the lives that people can lead. (Drèze and Sen 1995: 12--- )

This comment leads, in the first instance, to a critical reappraisal of the
conclusion that the labour market reforms resulted in a substantial
decrease in that part of the working population in Ahmedabad that
belongs to the lowest income class. On the basis of surveys conducted by
the National Council of Applied Economic Research, it is maintained
that the policy of informalization has fulfilled its promise to reduce
poverty and improve the distribution of income (Dutta and Batley 1999;
22--24). The presented statistics also showed that there was no change in
the percentage of households with an income of less than 36,000 rupees
a year between 1990 and 1993. On both counts, however, two-thirds of
the population surveyed remained below this level. In households with
an average number of five to six members there was therefore only $150
to $180 available for the subsistence of each member. This is not yet half
the amount set by the World Bank as the international minimum (a
dollar a day, recently doubled to two dollars a day) for a decent standard
of living. The authors could defend their standpoint by claiming that the
amount used as a yardstick for urban poverty at the time, according to
official government records, was only one dollar a day for the entire
household (i.e. 11,800 rupees per year). Instead of accepting this, I
conclude that lowering the yardstick for poverty indicates a deliberate
and persistent underexposure of the problem, in the same way that the
unequal distribution of economic growth is not taken into account.

Another aspect that receives little or no attention in quantitative
poverty studies is that, by retaining a constant definition of the deprivation
situation, to facilitate comparison, no account is taken of people's
changing perceptions of the insufficiency of their level of subsistence.
The perception of poverty depends partly on shifts in the balance of
social distribution which are made manifest in different lifestyles. The
suggestion that income inequality in Ahmedabad has been reduced as a
result of the liberalization of capital and the informalization of labour is
wishful thinking and can be maintained only if, during the collection of
data, no attention is devoted to many aspects of either pauperization at
the base of the urban economy or clearly visible signals of enrichment at
the top. In this connection, I see the tendency to idealize self-employment
in the many policy studies on the informal sector as an extension of
the desire on the part of the authorities concerned to avoid or minimize
involvement with flexibilized labour. The obstinacy with which this
form of employment is defined as micro-enterprise, while it is in fact
often little more than barely concealed wage labour, creates the impression
that this multitude of petty independents are quite able to meet their
own basic needs and are, moreover, perfectly capable to make their own
arrangements in protecting themselves against the adversities of life. It is
an ideological statement which suggests that working on one's own
account and at one's own risk is the best social safety net, with self-help
as the guiding principle.

There is much more at stake than the measurement of poverty and the
problem that arises cannot be explained only by referring to different
research methods between disciplines --- in concrete terms the contrast
between quantification and qualification or a micro versus a macro
approach. The poverty line approach, which has been so prominent in
the continuous debate waged on the percentage of the rural and urban
population remaining below or moving above it, is deeply flawed.
Instead of trying to figure out where the demarcation should be fixed,
(close to the bottom of the human condition it seems), the more
fundamental question is how poverty should be conceptualized. In
spelling out the uneven distribution of progress versus degradation,
dimensions such as quality standards of housing and schooling, rise in
infant mortality, loss of hope for a better life in the next generation and
exposure to pollution cannot be overlooked. Criteria other than purely
economic growth indicators would bring out the destructive consequences
of the predatory nature of Gujarat's path to capitalism.

From a sociological or anthropological standpoint it is important not
only to measure phenomena in isolation from each other but also to
explore the effects of their interaction by placing them in their social
context. In the study of poverty, relational aspects such as marginality,
discrimination, and dependency are of significance. I have examined
these aspects in detail in preceding chapters dealing with the situation in
which the former textile mill workers now find themselves. Their alienation
from mainstream society is expressed in their reduced access to
public services and institutions, including those that are in theory
intended for each and every citizen of Ahmedabad. This is accompanied
by a loss of control over the conditions that determine the quality of their
lives now and in the future. Market discrimination in how they live and
work reinforces the acute sense of deprivation and ensures that they do
not enjoy equal opportunities to improve their situation. Members of
stigmatized groups naturally seek contact with their own kind --- Muslims,
_Dalits_, and other social minorities exposed to discriminatory
practices, both individually and collectively --- for mutual support and
protection. A life of dependency, however, goes hand in hand with
restricted choice and lack of mobility. Indebtedness forces the ex-mill
workers to sell their labour power and that of other working members of
the household and, in exchange for an advance payment had to settle for
a lower wage. Such ties of dependency restrict the room for manoeuvre
and erode the already fragile powers of resistance. The incapacity to
escape the power of the employer or his agents, to always be at their beck
and call, is a fate that not only befalls agricultural labourers in rural areas.
The pressure to take extra risks and to perform dirty or hazardous work
can lead to permanent health damage. Any conceptualization of poverty
which fails to take the physical and mental ability to work into consideration
seems to be ill-defined. Still, these and other aspects are completely
ignored in poverty assessments that focused exclusively on levels of either
income or expenditure.

The various dimensions of vulnerability can occur independently
from each other and this differentiation contributes to the heterogeneity
of deprivation. There can also be a cumulative effect, however, a general
state of misery in which these dimensions coincide. This extreme state of
vulnerability makes it necessary to consider the ultra-poor as a separate
category. At a conservative estimate, around one fifth of the households
in Ahmedabad living beneath the poverty line belong to this pauperized
residual category. As in other states, Gujarat has introduced a number of
measures to alleviate the dire need of these people, including a modest
old age pension scheme for agricultural labourers, a monthly allowance
for needy widows and those with a physical handicap, and maternity
benefits for landless women. But these entitlements are not honoured
because of a lack of funds and the necessary administrative capacity, and
therefore remain inaccessible to the majority of the target group. This is
why I am in complete agreement with Jhabvala's observation that in the
informal sector milieu there is an enormous and as yet unfulfilled need
for work-related social security (Jhabvala 1998; _see also_ Unni and Bali
2001: 30--31 and Dayal 2001).

It should no longer be necessary to observe that development is more
than just growth of the gross national product. Yet this is the conventional
yardstick employed by the Indian government, urged on by the
leading transnational organizations, to measure the progress made in
reducing poverty. There has been much support for calls to use the much
broader concept of capability to assess the dynamics of economic,
political, and social well-being which find articulation in the Human
Development Index. But translating good intentions into a different
development strategy, in which efforts to achieve growth are accompanied
by both a just distribution of wealth and the participation rather
than marginalization of informal sector labour, is a different matter. On
the basis of my own research and with reference to a large number of
studies with a similar approach, I have endeavoured to demonstrate the
untenable and unjust nature of current economic policies in the case of
the majority of the people living and working at the bottom of
Ahmedabad's economy. Persistence with the doctrine of neoliberalism
with its almost social-Darwinist mind-set, will lead here too to further
widening of the gap between rich and poor.[^15/5] Gujarat could be understood
as an experiment for trying out what will happen to state and
society under a policy regime which does not attempt to mitigate the
most brutal consequences of a market-led mode of capitalist production.
The total eclipse of the kind of Gandhian values which for the better part
of the last century were so important in the promotion of a public image
both within and outside the country, has also led to the shrinking of
social space needed for humanizing economic growth. The disappearance
of a climate leaning towards social democracy and tolerance has
been accompanied by an increase of communal hate politics. The
labouring poor have suffered in manifold ways from this unfortunate
trend but they are by no means the only victims.

In acknowledgement of the urgent need to establish a social safety net
for the footloose proletariat stuck at the bottom of the urban and rural
economy, the government of India has now signalled its willingness to
introduce umbrella legislation to promote the welfare of unorganized
and unprotected labourers. In its recent report the National Commission
on Labour recommends the establishment of a special (Employment and
Welfare) Board. All workers belonging to this huge segment of the
labouring poor would have to be registered, either by employers or
themselves at facilitation centres to procure an identity card. This
document should provide them basic protection and welfare.

>Measures for protection have to include a policy framework that ensures the
generation and protection of jobs, and access to jobs; protection against the
exploitation of their poverty and lack of organisation: protection against arbitrary
and whimsical dismissals; denial of minimum wages; and delay in the
payment of wages; protection against unauthorised deductions; and safety and
dignity at places of work. The system of Welfare should include access to
compensation for injuries sustained while engaged in work; provident fund;
medical care; pensionary benefits; maternity benefits and child care in the case of
women workers. (Report of the National Commission on Labour, vol. I, 2002:752).

[^15/5]: For recent arguments in a similar vein, see Harriss-White and Gooptu 2000;
Hensman 2001.


For various reasons these wide-ranging proposals should not be taken
very seriously. The huge labour bureaucracy needed to implement this
policy would not be able to deliver what it has on offer, because of the
lack of countervailing power among the targeted clientele. The way the
labour inspectorates have operated in Gujarat clearly demonstrate how
and why these state agencies fall short of what their major task is: to
protect labour against exploitative and repressive practices (see Breman
1994: 291--331). Another reason for the failure that can easily be predicted
is the clause which says that the worker must make a commensurate
contribution to the cost of the scheme. The assumption that most if
not all of these underprivileged workers do have the financial capacity
needed to overcome their current and future vulnerability, is hardly
realistic.

### The Ongoing Struggle for a Better Life

In searching for an answer to the question why poverty reduction has
proceeded so slowly in south Asia, Drèze and Sen pointed to the
traditional significance of inequality as an organizing principle of the
social system.

>Successive governments in India have had reason enough to rely on the unending
patience of the neglected and deprived millions in India who have not risen in
fury about illiteracy, hunger, illness, or economic insecurity. The stubborn
persistence of these deprivations has much to do with that lack of fury. (Drèze
and Sen 1995: 87)

Is endless patience, the apparent capacity to endure immense poverty in
silence, indeed the state of mind with which a large part of the working
population responds to its exclusion from a better existence? I myself
_encountered_ more anger and resentment than patience during my fieldwork
in Ahmedabad. But then, too, it becomes necessary to explore why
these anxieties have not successfully been converted into a force for
emancipation. In my view, the low glow of this spark has less to do with
the power of tradition than with the impact of the new economic regime.

The countervailing power of the poor to rise up in protest is allayed by
pre-empting any opportunity to express it. One way of doing this is to
remove these underclasses as much as possible from the public eye.
Instead of a policy aimed at improving the misery of the subaltern
classes, the emphasis lies on measures designed to frustrate acts of
resistance to the established order. The propagation of an image of '_la
classe dangereuse_' runs parallel with the message that they can only be
prevented from causing social disruption by being kept firmly in their
place. In this view, poverty is seen as an existence on the margins of
legality. The way in which the men, women, and children who make up
the huge pool of informal workers in Ahmedabad benefit from extralegal
practices which they encounter in their daily lives has already been
discussed. But more frequently they themselves are the victims of such
practices. Their very existence is, by definition, a violation of countless
formal provisions relating to the use of city space. Lower-ranking civil
servants and street-level officials responsible for the preservation of
public order and authority demand tribute for tolerating informal sector
activities in locations where they are not permitted and the sale of
perishable goods under conditions that do not comply with the hygiene
regulations.

>Amidst the situation of increasing informalisation of labour market and thus
increasing vulnerability of the labour at the lower end of the market, the city
government has become stringent on the urban development issues. Because
there has been an increase in the number of hawkers in the city, an activity to
which many displaced workers had resorted to, the city government has started
a major anti-encroachment drive in the city. This has brought hawkers' ire,
pushing them to resort to agitation. (Mahadevia 1998: 528)

This comment suggests that economic, political, and social vulnerability
does not appear to stop informal sector workers from resisting prosecution.
A significant factor is that, unlike the large owners of formal and
informal riches they lack both the social capital and the money power to
buy the services --- legally or illegally --- of politicians or bureaucrats to
defend their interests in the formal sector of the economy. People living
on the margin of survival are an easy prey for slumlords and land
speculators.

As is often observed, in the landscape of informal sector labour, the
struggle to improve living conditions is hampered by the weak articulation
of collective action. Although strikes and other forms of militancy
are not rare, they are usually sudden, fragmented, and more or less
spontaneous eruptions of protest. Such recurrent acts of resistance are
restricted to disconnected local disputes, flaring up and dissipating again
in a short time. The incapacity to express power and solidarity systematically
rather than sporadically is in the first instance a consequence of the
segmented and highly volatile nature of the informal labour regime. The
small-scale and fragmented arenas that dominate this pattern of employment
present an obstacle to the emergence of organized structures to
represent interests within, let alone across branches of industry. This is
further hindered by the lack of security regarding the continuation (or
not) of work contracts that are intentionally vague. The widely varying
modalities of employment in the informal sector --- ranging from self-employment
to casual or semi-regular wage labour paid on a piecemeal
basis --- force workers to adopt different and sometimes mutually conflicting
survival strategies. In addition, those who provide work tend to
respond extremely negatively to any attempts on the part of workers to
form a common front. Bargaining for favours on an individual basis is
considered preferable to acting as a spokesman for others in claiming
alleged rights. Such expressions of joint assertiveness can be enough to
qualify for instant dismissal. Other than the quality of the work performed,
the extent to which an employer sees an employee as obedient
and essentially docile is an important criterion in hiring, promotion, and
firing.

Clearly, too, besides the way in which they are employed, the state of
dire poverty in which the majority of those who work in the informal
sector live presents an obstacle to collective action. In such deprived
circumstances, they do not have the time, space, or reserves necessary to
make demands together with those who share their fate. The dismissed
mill workers have not only been forced into greater deprivation in
material terms. Having to agree to a regime of exploitation and subordination
as a result of their loss of job security is an extremely heavy burden
to bear. And it means having to leave behind the self-respect that was
such a significant part of their social consciousness as mill workers and
trade union members.

The riots in the past revolved around the promise held out to the
subaltern castes (both _Dalits_ and OBCs) for a larger share in the public
cake. The solemn pledge to the lower classes for a better deal in the spoils
of development was very much a product of Congress politics but also in
that party rather lightly made to a segmented vote bank clubbed together
on the basis of their underprivileged status. That electoral strategy has
been overtaken by systematic efforts since the early 1980s to split the
ranks of the labouring poor on the basis of their diverse social identities.
In the campaign led by the BJP party and her front organizations
religious loyalties were articulated and became fault lines in the sharpened
struggle for access to scarce resources at the lower end of the urban
economy. The earlier antagonism between _Patels_, _Dalits_ and OBCs was
invalidated in a new political agenda which urged all of them as Hindus
to confront the enemy in our midst', the Muslim minority. These new
alignments should, moreover, be understood as a consequence of the
vacuum left by the now practically defunct TLA.

Unable to comprehend why they were expelled from the formal sector
of the economy, the former mill workers in Ahmedabad feel disillusioned
and alienated. Some of the victims of the policy of informalization have
been unable to accept their fate and have sought 'early retirement'. But
the awareness still exists that their former assertiveness was a product of
the social struggle they had fought. The memory of this time explains
why their anger at the inactivity of the TLA at the time of the closures is
mixed with nostalgia for the way in which, in better times, the union had
assured them a better quality of work and life. The downfall of this once
so mighty representative of the power of labour seems imminent. In the
old city centre, the imposing union building in the city's centre-completed
in 1950 and 'voluntarily' funded by members' contributions ---
wears a deserted look. Gone are the glory days of mass meetings and
union power located here that confronted the city's captains of industry.
A bronze sculpture above the entrance to the _Gandhi Majoor Sevalaya_
depicts the way in which the 'righteous struggle' was fought: two mill
workers, a man and a woman, look up with adoration at the Mahatma as
he points the way to a shining industrial future. Women had been made
to leave the mills long ago and have been followed more recently --- with
the exception of a small rearguard --- by the men.

Notwithstanding my major reservations about the analysis given by
Varshney for the outbreak of communal violence in Ahmedabad, which
I will discuss in more detail later, I have no problem in accepting his
indictment of the TLA leadership in their failure to put up a fight in the
last round of 'the righteous struggle'.

>As the first generation of truly committed leadership passed away, the TLA
became the victim of its own success. Its new leaders did not have to work as
hard, and the bureaucratised top and middle of the organisation increasingly lost
touch with the base. By the 1960s, much against the Gandhian principles, some
of its leaders had started living lavish lives; in the name of conciliation they had
also developed collusive relations with mill owners; and they were no longer
responsive to workers' interests. (Varshney 2002: 273)

The harsh conclusion, however, suggests a break in style between past
and present union bosses which, at least in my opinion, should be
moderated in favour of the leaders still around.[^15/6]

The few aged union leaders who have remained semi-active argue
among themselves who bears the greatest responsibility for the decline
and fall of their life's work. Every day, they still come for a couple of
hours to the office to meet workers who have not yet given up hope of
receiving the compensation to which they are entitled but which has not
yet been paid out. In my interviews with the elderly directorate I asked
what was going to happen now, but received no answer. Obstinately, I
probed further and asked whether it might not have been possible for the
sacked workers to remain members of the TLA. No, I am assured by the
General Secretary, a man well into his eighties, because without factories
there is no need for trade unions.

But is this true? The Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA)
tells a different story. Ela Bhatt, the founder of this organization for
working women at the base of the urban economy, started her long career
when she joined the TLA staff in 1955. She helped devise the gratuity
scheme which gave members the right to a bonus payment for every year
they had worked in the mill. As head of the department responsible for
providing the wives of the mill workers with information on child care
and housekeeping, she became aware of how women were accustomed to
work at home to help earn income for the family. This experience made
her critical of her role within the union --- educating her clients to be
good mothers and housewives. In 1972 she was given permission to set
up a union for women within the TLA and took the office of secretary.
At her initiative a bank was established to meet the desperate need for
credit among the members, either self-employed or working for wages.
In her daily activity Elaben Bhatt _encountered_ practices of discrimination
against mill workers from the lowest caste. This reinforced her belief
in the value and necessity of the reservation policy, which included a
package of measures intended for the protection and the promotion of
upward mobility of members belonging to the scheduled and backward
castes. Her forceful opinions were not shared by many of the TLA leaders
and in 1981, after she had expressed her support for continuation of this
public policy in a mass meeting, she fell into disfavour. Subsequently the
union leaders broke all ties with her and SEWA. Now, although the TLA
is on the verge of folding up, SEWA is thriving. In Ahmedabad alone, the
membership has gone up to more than 150,000 women, who make use
of the services it provides, such as credit, health facilities, life insurance,
and legal aid. The women who were expelled from the mills in the
previous generations can rightly be seen as the present-day torchbearers
of the righteous struggle' that Gandhi launched in the early years of the
last century to improve the lot of the industrial workers. SEWA is, for
instance, also responsible for organizing the protests of street vendors
against their eviction from public space. A few years ago Ela Bhatt and
her staff achieved one of their greatest successes when the ILO adopted
a convention for the protection of homeworkers. Hopefully, the recommendations
she has made to the Second National Commission of
Labour on informal sector labour will have an equally favourable effect.
There is no reason to have all too high expectations of this report, but the
least that policy-makers should be obliged to do is devote more attention
to the position of women in the informalized labour market (Report of
the Study Group on Umbrella Legislation for the Workers in the
Unorganised Sector 2002).

[^15/6]: Although some of these veterans are quite scrupulous in making decisions and adhere
to a Gandhian lifestyle, I should add that other senior leaders would find it difficult to
defend themselves against accusations of fraud and corruption. The leadership of the
union has started selling off assets and property in a manner which is anything but
transparent. Transactions are also not accounted for but remain hidden from public
scrutiny. Members were never kept closely informed about the union's business and
nowadays less than ever before.


As part of the programme of economic liberalization, the flexibilization
of labour has resulted in a dramatic weakening of the political position of
the trade union movement. Yet, in forming an opinion on this decline,
and the concomitant exodus of members, it should be realized that, even
in the heyday of collective action, with a planned economy and a huge
public sector, only a very small percentage of the working population
ever belonged to one of the many organizations representing labour. In
the post-colonial era the large unions became used to protecting almost
exclusively those employed under formal sector conditions. Also among
this vanguard --- which never accounted for more than a tenth part of the
working population --- less than half have ever become union members.[^15/7]
This select group allowed itself to be led, both at and outside the
workplace, by interests and loyalties which ran counter to more encompassing
bonds of solidarity. The call to strengthen class consciousness
and to define the stakes in the social struggle on the basis of shared
interests, even when the ideology of some of the more radical unions
considered the existence of such a consciousness self-evident, always had
to compete with allegiance to social ties of a primordial nature. In the
large textile industry in Ahmedabad, right up to the end, caste was a
major factor, not only in the organization of work in the mills, but also
in the representation of the workers within the TLA. The increasing
practices of discrimination to which the Muslim community has been
exposed in the city in recent decades meant that the proportion of the
working population in the mills that belonged to this minority had fallen
considerably long before the closures. Muslims used to form a much
larger group within the mill workforce. I spoke earlier of how Muslim
leaders told me that they had taken no action to oppose this selective
expulsion for fear of sparking off communal riots. The same information
is also reported by Mahadevia and D'Costa (1997: 43).

The collapse of organized representation has made the army of ex-mill
workers, and their male offspring in particular, vulnerable to invitations
from communal forces to join them in various kinds of locality based
activities. The sustained policy of the Indian trade union movement not
to mobilize informal sector workers should be judged as a historic
blunder. Timely acknowledgement of the organic links between the
informal and informal sectors of the economy would have made it
possible to co-opt the labouring poor in the struggle to promote the
rights of all segments of the working class in a balanced manner. A
broader based programme than the one which continued to focus only
on a small and shrinking segment of the total workforce could have
prevented the agents of organized labour from becoming helpless bystanders
to the ongoing onslaught of informalization which has eroded
whatever political strength they might have had in the past. There have
been some remarkable exceptions, however, to the general decline of the
formal labour movement. In Kerala in particular social activists aligned
to different political parties have successfully campaigned for a minimum
of socio-economic security for men and women in the informal
sector of the economy.[^15/8] What at one stage seemed to be swimming
against the tide may very well become a new model for facilitating the
emancipation of fragmented and subaltern segments of the working
population. In representing the interests of the labouring poor, the new
organizations have to draw up an agenda which distinguish them from
conventional trade unions catering to members higher up in the employment
hierarchy.

[^15/7]: The trend is not towards increase but further decline in organizational strength.
According to the World Labour Report 1997--8, published by the ILO, union membership
as a percentage of non-agricultural labour dropped from the already low level of 6.6% in 1985 to 5.5% in 1995. (ILO 1998)

### The Last Round

Social ties based on principles other than class solidarity play a leading
role in the articulation of identities in the informal sector milieu. Caste
and creed operate as signposts in seeking and finding work. Entitlement
to favours and protection or support in the event of misfortune are also
channelled along these lines. Such forms of social inclusion take on the
character of networks based on primordial bonds without necessarily
always emerging as neatly structured associations. This explains why they
remain often invisible to outsiders. The suggestion that these are forms
of false consciousness overemphasizes their ideological aspect, whilst
denying the practical significance of caste and religion to the way in
which people try to reduce their vulnerability in daily life. Such identities
also permit collective action, especially in situations where class-based
assertiveness might be subject to all kinds of social restrictions. This is
how we should also understand the strength of sectarian movements
which call on their followers to free themselves from a situation of
repression and deprivation. But, in contrast to the emancipatory élan
that these segmentary movements may display there is also the fact that
mobilizing such formations for political, economic, and cultural objectives
occurs at the expense of breaking through horizontal dividing lines
or, indeed, even tend to reinforce them. Strengthening identities within
a closed group can shift the focus of attention away from solidarity with
'others'. Short-range engagement prevents the search for bonding with
those who share the same fate on the basis of a social perspective inspired
by the struggle for a better existence for all those who live in poverty.

[^15/8]: For an early report of these struggles see Kannan 1988.


It is not, in the last instance, for this reason that the strategic choices
made by SEWA in Ahmedabad merit attention. The union is aware of
the diverse identities of its membership, the large majority of whom
come from the lower and lowest Hindu castes and the Muslim minority.
But the starting point for the programme of activities is not their
differences but the interests they share: their position as working women,
and as residents of deprived neighbourhoods or slums. In the informal
sector landscape, loyalties based on restricted associational networks
retain their power because of their clear benefits to those who belong to
them. Next to work, gender and locality can be seen as examples of
identities which are appropriate catalysts for collective action. Adopting
these as guiding principles for mobilization at grassroots level encourages
a feeling of solidarity that helps to break through more restrictive social
barriers. In the final analysis, the success of this formula depends on the
ability of the SEWA leadership to upgrade its grassroots cadre to senior
staff positions and on the understanding, both at the top and among the
rank and file, that their struggle is not only for economic gains but also
to build up political power in the fight for justice and equity. That
endeavour, ambitious but highly commendable, is endangered if the
established order goes on to encourage division along vertical lines and
propagates hatred and the elimination of people who are reconstructed
as a new class of 'untouchables'.

In a recent study on the socio-political context of communal violence
in India, Varshney has focused on the importance of civic networks for
binding Hindus and Muslims together (Varshney 2002). He argues that
in the case of Ahmedabad, a truly impressive level of civic activity was
built up during the national movement, to a large extent initiated by
Gandhi. The main pillars of civil engagement that emerged were a: the
Congress Party, which brought people of all communities together; b: a
wide variety of social and educational agencies, set up by Gandhi and his
associates, which later became known as non-governmental organizations;
c: business associations (such as the AMA) which had a long tradition of
intercommunal interaction in the framework of artisan and mercantile
guilds; d: last but not least, the TLA as a working class organization
which had both Hindu and Muslim mill hands in its fold and a
programme that preached unity. In Varshney's opinion, these institutions
were together crucial for producing a social climate characterized
by harmony. Once these pillars started to crumble, and the collapse of
the textile industry happened to be a major turning point, communal
violence became ferocious. The author himself modifies his thesis of a
strong Hindu-Muslim engagement which prevailed until a few decades
ago. Congress leaders were never able, nor did they aim to, mobilize a
large number of Muslims in the city during the anti-colonial struggle;
only few Gandhian institutions reached out to either urban or rural
segments of the main religious minority, the business associations in the
city had an in-group character and did not promote civic interaction. As
for the TLA, Varshney concedes that a large proportion of Muslim mill
workers decided to stay away from this union. Following up on the
substance of earlier chapters, I beg to differ from his main argument
suggesting that political Hinduism is an altogether new phenomenon in
Ahmedabad which has brought to an end the climate of tolerance and
harmony built up by Gandhi and his disciples. A.M. Shah, amongst
others, has critically questioned the suggestion that Gandhi's message of
non-violence had penetrated deeply in Gujarati society and culture
during his lifetime Whatever social relevance it then had, it certainly did
not survive him (A.M. Shah 2002: 58). My own opinion is that the
communal divide which already existed in the past was strengthened by
the segmentary, though not confrontational politics adopted by Congress
before and after Independence. This parochial strategy, the KHAM
coalition consisting of Kshatriyas, _Harijans_, _Adivasis_ and Muslims, contained
the underclasses in their own and separate identities as convenient
vote banks. This electoral design was successful for a short span of time
only because it provoked a vigorous and vicious backlash from those
higher up in society. Their pent up resentment was the momentum
which the Hindutva forces capitalized to come to power.

My historical perspective on social transformation in Gujarat differs
from the one presented by Varshney. His analysis lacks empirical substantiation
and, moreover, falls short in discussing the changing political
economy of the state and its ramifications for the social fabric in which
the people are enmeshed. In my opinion the forces of communalism
need to be understood by taking into account the fierce competition for
the shrinking or expanding economic space in which the various social
classes constituting urban society are involved. As I have argued in
previous chapters also, the recurrent riots in Ahmedabad towards the end
of the twentieth century cannot be understood merely as an upsurge of
Hindu nationalism under high-caste leadership, planned and organized
from a Hindutva perspective. The high tide of communalism is engineered
by the promotion of a political economy which seeks to keep the
working classes fragmented and in a state of dependency in order to
reduce the price of their labour to the lowest possible level.

At the end of February and in early March 2002, violence once again
erupted in Ahmedabad --- on a scale and intensity that far surpassed that
of previous years. As I have said before it is much too facile to suggest a
direct causation between the looting, burning, and killing, which reached
its climax in the industrial localities of the city, and massive impoverishment
due to the collapse of the textile mills in the preceding quarter of
a century. A major difference with the earlier communal riots was that
this time the search and destroy operation was not a spontaneous
outburst of discontent and rivalry among people living at the bottom of
the urban economy but well planned in advance and carried out
with brutal precision. In an article, written when the violence in the
streets of Ahmedabad was still going on, G. Shah identified four types of
actors.

>The organizers, who meticulously prepare plan and evolve strategies. Many of
them are not on the site. They also chart out the route for the attacks in different
localities. VHP leaders had admitted, the list identifying Muslims was prepared
on the 28th morning \[note: February 2002\]. The organizers are primarily the top
rank leaders. The majority of them happen to be Brahmins. And more important,
they subscribe to the _brahmanical_ ideology of the caste system. The second
set of actors are the skilled and experienced personnel constituting the core. They
have mastered the craft of breaking shutters and doors, pulling down ceilings and
walls, using electrical devices for setting fire and burning people, using swords
and other weapons. In the present riots, gas cylinders and other chemicals were
used to destroy property. They function in a group of ten to twenty with all the
necessary equipment. The leaders of the group (more than one) are committed
'_Hindutvavadis_', believing that they are performing their dharma, and are
trained like all terrorists, be they Muslim or Christian fundamentalists. For
them, their caste or other identity is not important, though it would seem that
the majority of them belong to the upper and middle castes. The rest are
professional goons routinely involved in criminal activities. They are called and
mobilized by the organizers who provide patronage and political protection.
(Shah 2002: 1391).

There is ample documentation for the conclusion that the escalation
occurred largely because the BJP state government provided no protection
for the victims of persecution, but gave its supporters a free hand ---
and even encouraged them --- in their witch-hunt against members of the
religious minority. The reconstruction of communal identities under the
_Sangh Parivar_ aegis has produced an all-Hindu platform from which the
Muslims are targeted as outsiders. _Dalits_ have lost their 'beyond the pale'
classification and are supposed to pay for their social acceptance within
the Hindutva fold by joining the hunt against the excluded minority
made to live at the margins of society as a new category of untouchables.

Eyewitnesses like Kapilabehn, a SEWA grassroots worker, have given
nightmarish descriptions of the recent violence and counter-violence.

>What can I tell you? I have seen terrible scenes --- everything happened in front of
my eyes. I have seen mobs of 4,000 to 5,000 men stalking the city with guns and
swords, burning and looting. I have seen one man's hands cut off, another's
stomach ripped open and intestines hanging out. I have also seen the police
actively participating in all of this. I have seen the dead and injured lying on the
road with no first aid. I have seen death, blood, suffering, fear --- I have seen
things like never before. I can never forget what I witnessed. When I visited
Ambikanagar, a Hindu community, there was nothing there; everything had
been razed to the ground. It was the same for Mariam bibi ka Masjid, a Muslim
area. Not a single hut was left. All we could see were the charred remains of the
house and the belongings strewn about. I sat down and cried, how can we rebuild
after such destruction? (Bhatt 2002)

Like many women who are members of this informal sector trade union,
Kapilabehn lives in a part of the city where the textile mills used to be
located which, until the recent past, provided their men with formal
sector work. It is indicative of the scale of the violence that raged in the
former textile neighbourhoods that, of the 155,000 women who in early
2002 were members of SEWA in Ahmedabad, 38,000 became victims to
a greater or lesser extent of the wave of anger and hatred that lasted for
several weeks. 21,900 were forced to flee to one of the 46 camps set up
to provide emergency shelter (Bhatt 2002: 17). What needs to be
highlighted is that on an earlier occasion, during the riots of December
1992, Hindu nationalists managed to intimidate SEWA's leaders into
submission. The warning came, thus Varshney reports, that:

>If they organised for communal harmony on a large scale, they were told, the
offices of SEWA and its workers might not be safe. It was obvious to SEWA that
if it wanted to fight Hindu national militants, the union's infrastructure would
inevitably become a target of the militants' wrath. (Varshney 2002: 254)

The author adds that the SEWA sisters concluded that they would rather
lie low and secure their own homes than organize for peace on a bigger
scale. Varshney's preposterous comment on this episode is that a male
union of such large membership would not have cowered under this
threat. He seems to have lost sight of the brutal treatment with which the
_Sangh Parivar_ warriors, then and now again, have dealt with their
opponents. Having said that, I agree that SEWA should make use of the
public space it has created to take a political stand and to squarely
confront Hindutva's agenda, because the underlying ideology is totally
opposed to the interests of the working class, irrespective of women and
men, Muslims or Hindus.

The residents of the slum localities were not only the victims of
communal rage and hatred, but also responded _en masse_ to the call to
eliminate the members of the opposing group. The main targets of the
violence were Muslims, many hundreds of whom --- men, women and
children --- were killed, often in the most horrific ways. The pogrom
made it clear that the _Sangh Parivar_ organizations had succeeded in
inciting the _Lumpen_ army of unemployed and semi-unemployed youth
in the old industrial districts to murder, looting, and arson. In an early
report on these events, I made a link between the mass redundancies that
accompanied the closure of the mills, the impoverishment and degradation
of the industrial neighbourhoods and the pogroms which took place
largely in this milieu. The social cohesion that once existed has gone.
Although, even when the mills were open, the adjoining workers' colonies
were divided according to caste and faith, these were small-scale
concentrations no larger than a few _chawls_ or blocks of houses. The other
was not at a distance but highly visible and touchable as a workmate, a
customer, a neighbour or, a friend with whom close contact was maintained
both within and outside the mill. I already had occasion to refer
to Jivan Thakore's recollections in the preceding chapters about 'the good
old days' before the mills started to close down. There is no denying that
working in the mill together created feelings of inter-communal friendship
and solidarity that have since faded away.

>Our Monogram mill housed an equal number of Muslims and Christians along
>with Hindu workers. There was a small setup of Hindu's _Meldi_ goddess in the
>spinning division of our mill. Mechanic department had a bigger temple of
>_Mahadev_ (Lord Shankar), and Shaal department had a mosque near it. All freely
>visited these places without any hindrances. Muslim leaders used to be present
>for any events in temples of _Meldi_ and _Mahadev_ and Hindu leaders would
>participate in _Vayaj_ (religious discourse) at mosque. Such emotional interaction
>kept communal harmony in our mill intact. ...
>
>Ismail, a resident of Juni _chawl_ in Bapunagar was of my age and operated a
>doffer machine in the shift next to mine (he undertook _Haj_ pilgrimage in 1999).
>He is a brother-in-law of Rasul, my friend from Rajpur. So, I consider him coworker
>as well as friend. Ismail had retained a Brahmin cook at his son's marriage
>for cooking for fifty of us Hindus. We participated happily in their marriage
>ceremonies as Muslims also attended ours. We visited each other's house in the
>event of any sickness in their family. Such were the emotional bonds we shared.
>We went to mourn death in Muslim household and they visited Hindus in such
>circumstances. They also joined in the last journey and stayed with us through
>the entire cremation ceremony. Such feelings of love and brotherhood died with
>the death of the mills. Ahmedabad's industrialists not only slaughtered the mills
>but also wrecked the Hindu-Muslim brotherhood. This is the whole truth.
>(Thakore 2002)

This close-knit community feeling which used to exist, lives on in the
narratives about what has been lost. They are memories of visits to one's
neighbours, to take part in the joys and sorrows of family life, to pay their
respects or to show each other hospitality on festive occasions, to share
the burden of everyday problems. This mesh of social cohesion that
transcended the separate identity niches broke down once the mill had
closed, the TLA started to fade away, and municipal agencies, due to lack
of funding, ceased or drastically curtailed their welfare activities, which
were also meeting points. The climate of social Darwinism that replaced
it not only established the right of the survival of the fittest, but meant
that the weakest at the base of society are forced to compete with each
other as hunter and hunted. In the course of my own stay in Ahmedabad
during these fateful days in March 2002 I met with the Secretary General
of the TLA. He told me about his despair when he failed to get through
to the police commissioner or to politicians of the ruling party once the
pogrom had started. The lack of response to his incessant calls from his
office on February 28th 2002 made him realize that the state machinery
deliberately refused to end the rampage and that his union now really
had become a spent force (Breman 2002: 1486). In the wake of the
communal riots which swept through the mill localities in 1969, the
TLA leadership had invited Khan Abdul Badshah Khan, better known as
the 'Frontier Gandhi', to visit Ahmedabad. In the Jumma Masjid he
called for reconciliation and criticized those who used their own faith to
persecute others who thought differently and blamed them of practicing
a false social consciousness. His speech was reprinted in _Majoor Sandesh_
in March 2002. When I left Ahmedabad at the end of that month, order
and peace had not yet been restored in the city. The curfew was lifted in
some parts of the city, only to be re-imposed the next day in the same or
other localities because of new incidents. There has been hardly any
discussion of what all this meant for the large number of working class
households who fully depend on the erratic and meagre yield of their
labour power. Even under so-called normal circumstances steady employment
is difficult to come by, but for more than three weeks at a
stretch they had not able to move around in their cumbersome search for
gainful work. For many of them the regular state of deprivation in which
they live has further deteriorated into destitution. Without any food left
and bereft of all creditworthiness, they have to survive on whatever
private charities are willing to dole out to them (Breman 2002: 1487).
What does deserve attention is that, with a few exceptions, the institutions
that represent civil society took no action at all when the communal
riots and the horrific violence that accompanied them broke out.
Ahmedabad is proud of the large number of non-governmental agencies
located in the city. In the past, commentators have widely praised their
role in tackling poverty. This generated a hugely exaggerated picture,
which included the glorification of NGO initiatives to which the private
sector and the local government also contributed (see Dutta 2002 and
others). These efforts have, however, reaped few benefits for the poorer
sections of the population, and for the large number of Muslims among
them in particular. For collective action, the city's excluded minority has
always been, and remaing, dependent on charity from the
munity. In the pauperized industrial districts of Ahmedabad 'the righteous
struggle', which did succeed in generating a certain amount of
intercommunal solidarity, lives on only in the memory of a better past.

Collective action is a necessary condition for the achievement of a
better life. In the 1930s, the inhabitants of _Marienthal_ in Austria were
able to alleviate the poverty resulting from their dismissal from the
factories because of the unemployment benefits they received. The statefunded
allowances were extremely meagre but essential for their survival
during the economic recession. A welfare state which provides ample
social security from the cradle to the grave may have become a chapter in
the social history of West European societies. This does not mean to say,
however, that the social awareness that has been aroused through a long
process of emancipation should inevitably be subordinated to the unbridled
interplay of economic supply and demand. The price for that,
expressed in the emergence of new inequalities in and outside the labour
market, is too high. Social security schemes should be insisted upon if
only to build up the countervailing power needed to mitigate the
harmful consequences of employment insecurity. As I come to the end of
my argument, I observe that regulation by the government and restriction
of the workings of the free market are necessary to put an end to the
exclusion from a decent standard of life of the huge and still growing
army of labour in the informal sector, which is in many respects used as
a reserve. To ensure that a coolie class of untouchables does not form at
the broad base of the world economy, encompassing a considerable
proportion of humanity, the formulation and implementation of an
extensive programme of social welfare is urgently required.
