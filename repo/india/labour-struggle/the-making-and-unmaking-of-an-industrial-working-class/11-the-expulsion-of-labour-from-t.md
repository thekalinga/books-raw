## The Expulsion of Labour from the Formal Sector of the Economy

### Mill Closures

Ahmedabad had more than 60 corporate textile mills in the late 1970s
which provided close to 160,000 jobs. Of these, 85,000 were held by
permanent workers, around 40,000 were _badli_ or substitute workers
while the remaining contingent consisted of contract workers who did
not appear either in the mill administration or in industrial statistics.[^11/1] In
1981 the total workforce in the city amounted to nearly 750,000 men
and women, with a total urban population of over two and a half million
in that year. At least two-thirds of all gainfully employed were active in
the informal sector of the economy, as casual labourers or own-account
workers. The formal sector even then comprised no more than 250,000
employees during the early 1970s. Among this working class elite
150,000 were classified as industrial labourers, of which three quarters
found employment in the cotton mills on formal sector conditions
(Papola and Subramaniam 1975:119).

Nearly all of these textile workers lived and worked in a crescent
around the old city centre, located on the east bank of the Sabarmati
river. This part of Ahmedabad was a huge industrial zone, a densely
populated landscape in which dozens of mill chimneys reached skywards
as beacons to the labour that toiled below them. But no smoke has
billowed from most chimneys in recent years. The sirens that used to call
the workers from the surrounding neighbourhoods at the beginning of
each shift have been silenced one by one.

[^11/1]: Sharma's figures are identical. According to him the 64 mills operating in Ahmedabad
at the end of 1979 had a total workforce of 158,713; 122,850 were permanently and
36,133 casually employed (Sharma 1980: 4). Other authors listed 75 mills with 139,104
employees for the same year (Mahadevia and D'Costa 1997: 23); Howell and Kambhapatti
concluded that because of the closure of 52 mills in Ahmedabad the workforce had shrunk
from 125,557 to around 25,000 by the end of 1996 (1997: 21).


The progressive closure of the mills since 1980 has a variety of causes:
the switch from cotton to synthetic yarns as a result of changing dress
fashions among consumers, the refusal of the capital-owning producers
to invest in new technology, loss of competitiveness as a result of low
productivity combined with failing management and, last but not least,
the splitting up of the composite phases in the textile production process
and the relocation of weaving to small and low-cost workshops with no
protection at all for the workers involved.[^11/2] These dramatic changes in the
organization of the industry were sanctioned and much encouraged by a
new government policy on textile production that was introduced in
1985 and which gave priority to economic liberalization and flexibilization
of labour relations. It basically meant privileging small-scale production
in powerloom workshops, which had sprung up in the informal sector of
the economy, above large-scale production in composite mills in the
formal sector. There is of course much more to be said about the
restructuring of industrial capital that has taken place in recent decades,
but this is not the place to do so.[^11/3] My main concern in this as well as
subsequent chapters is the mass dismissal of the mill workers and the
dramatic changes this has brought about in their way of life.

The rapid decline of the large-scale textile industry was not restricted
to Ahmedabad, but nowhere else in India did it have such a deep
impact.[^11/4] During the first wave of closures in the late 1970s and early
1980s, 40,000 labourers lost their secure jobs. The start of a new
industrial policy in 1985 gave rise to a second and even more substantial
round of mill closure and retrenchment. Towards the end of the last
decade of the twentieth century, 52 enterprises had ceased operating or
were on the verge of locking the mill gates. By the end of 1996 the
workforce had shrunk to 25,000 at the most. But whereas the first wave
of closures in the early 1980s had generated great indignation in
Ahmedabad, the public clamour gradually subsided. In the 1990s, each
new closure and the ensuing loss of hundreds or even thousands of jobs
invoked little response outside the immediate circle of those directly
affected. Media reports were restricted to the bare facts and politicians
appeared to have lost their earlier interest in the issue. There are no upto-date
figures available on the size of this army of rejected mill workers,
but their number further increased in the course of my research between
1998 and 2000. The famous Calico mill, one of the oldest enterprises
owned by the Sarabhai family, closed down and the huge Reliance
enterprise laid off a large part of its workforce. In an essay on the political
economy of Ahmedabad in historical perspective, Spodek commented
on what seemed to be the terminal stage of the large-scale textile industry
in the city.

[^11/2]: T.Roy has critically discussed the reasons for this shift in a richly documented analysis (1998).

[^11/3]: The complex causes of the decline in the industry will not be considered further here.
The principles and considerations of the new textile policy introduced in 1985 are
elaborated upon in a government policy document included as appendix 2 in Leadbeater (1993).

[^11/4]: In Mumbai, Kanpur, Coimbatore, and Chennai most corporate textile enterprises
also shut down in the last quarter of the twentieth century. With the exception of
Mumbai, however, nowhere was the number of closed mills so big as in Ahmedabad. In
the wake of a prolonged strike in Mumbai, which lasted from January 1982 until August
1983, 100,000 labourers lost their jobs. The stopping of production, total or in part, in
most factories in subsequent years, resulted in a reduction of employment which was even
more massive than in Ahmedabad. But the relatively much higher share of this branch of
industry in all economic activity in the city famed as 'the Manchester of India' implied that
nowhere the impact of mill closures has been as dramatic as in Ahmedabad.


>The closing in 1998 of the Calico Mills, for more than a century the flagship of
the Sarabhai family enterprises, was one dramatic indication of the change. More
recent problems at Arvind Mills, which has run colossal deficits over the past few
years, show the Lalbhai family also under serious economic pressure. In 1986
Arvind moved strongly into the production of denim cloth to tap global markets
and to avoid competition of powerlooms. It became the third largest denim
manufacturer in the world with a capacity of 120 million metres per year, out of
all of India's capacity of 200 million metres, but by 1999, competition had
multiplied and tastes had changed producing a global slump.' (Spodek 2000:1632)

One possible explanation for the waning interest in the collapse of the
textile industry is that it was not caused by a more general economic
crisis in the city's economy. The closure of the corporate textile mills was
accompanied by the advent of other branches of industry, such as
petrochemical and pharmaceutical enterprises, diamond cutting-andpolishing
workshops, powerloom units, garment ateliers, and cement
factories. A mark of the changing times was that the employers' association
which had dominated the urban landscape for so long decided to
change its name in 1975 from AMA to ATMA: Ahmedabad Textile
Millowners Association. The new industrial estates that have arisen on
the outskirts of the city, located here to escape from municipal control as
well as taxes, are badly planned. Operations taking place here are not
only illegal but also highly unsafe. The mushrooming of small-scale and
footloose industries has led to a degree of environmental degradation
which is beyond imagination. Even more important than the emergence
of new industrial activity was the shift in the city's economic balance
from the secondary to the tertiary sectors, i.e. to trade and services. By
1991 the population of greater Ahmedabad had risen to 3.3 million, of
which a little over a million were registered as workers. Published
statistics do not immediately suggest that large-scale de-industrialization
has led to a decline in the standard of living of the working classes.
Several authors have claimed that the ex-mill workers managed to gain
access to other niches in the urban economy which provided them with
regular employment and reasonable pay. These good news stories are
backed up by low recorded levels of unemployment and statistical data
which show that while the sectoral restructuring during the 1980s and
1990s was taking place, the percentage of households in the city living
below the poverty line went down substantially. Should these reports
lead us to assume that somehow the majority of the ex-mill workers were
able to find jobs which resulted in incomes firmly above the poverty line?

My negative answer to this question is based on the research that I
carried out in the textile mill districts of Ahmedabad. In analysing the
situation as it has developed in the past 20 years, I was able to make use
of a large volume of published and unpublished reports, most of which
deal with the events that led up to the mill closures and their immediate
effects. Much less is known about what happened to labourers who lost
their jobs and the impact this had on the households to which they
belonged. This became the subject of a study I carried out in 1998 and
1999 in close cooperation with B.B. Patel, who is associated with the
Gandhi Labour Institute. Our quantitative analysis was based on a
survey of 600 ex-mill workers between March and July 1998. Since there
was no source data on the total size and composition of the population
affected by the closures it was not possible to compose a representative
sample. The initial criteria for selecting households was to choose respondents
who had worked in mills that had stopped production in
successive years. Consequently, we interviewed respondents from 33
mills, from which a total of 59,746 workers lost their jobs. Seven of these
mills closed between 1980 and 1985, 13 between 1986 and 1990, four
between 1991 and 1993 and nine between 1994 and 1998. The fact that
the closures were spread over a considerable period allowed us to take
account of the time required to come to terms with the shock of
dismissal and to shed more light on the problems associated with seeking
new employment. A second significant variable was age. We divided the
respondents into those younger or older than 49 at the time of the
survey. We also classified them according to what they had done in the
mills, basing the categories on the consecutive phases of the labour
process --- spinning, weaving, and the further processing of the textiles
(bleaching, dyeing, printing and packaging) --- or support functions such
as supervisory, maintenance, catering, security or cleaning staff. Our
consideration here was that the work experience and skill in the mills
would be of relevance for the kind of employment sought. We ensured
that the selected households reflected more or less the same distribution
of caste and religious identities as earlier studies had shown pertaining in
the mills. As we shall see, these diverse social formations (which we
specified roughly as: coming from within or outside Gujarat, membership
of a higher, middle or lower caste, Hindu or Muslim) were closely
related to the kind of work performed in the mills and the position in the
mill hierarchy. B.B. Patel, who had handled a series of similar investigations
for the Gandhi Labour Institute since the early 1980s took care of
the training and supervision of the field investigators responsible for the
collection of data.

To supplement the survey of 600 former mill workers, I selected, on
the basis of the same criteria, 60 households for more detailed investigations.
This meant talking to and spending time with the ex-mill workers
and family members about their experiences during and since the closures
in more detail. During this fieldwork, which took six months in
total during 1998 and 1999, I also met many informal leaders who had
emerged from the ranks of the former mill workers, usually during the
struggle generated by the mass redundancies, as well as cadres and
officials of the TLA and some other unions, to gain a clearer idea of the
role played by these institutional intermediaries. For the same reason I
met highand low-ranking officials in government agencies who could
tell me what had come of the various benefit schemes and retraining
programmes. I spoke to several dozen people who were taking part in
short courses or had completed them in the recent past. I further visited
most Labour Welfare Centres located in the industrial districts, to gain
first-hand information on the activities organized to tackle the problems
_encountered_ by the textile workers and their families. This neighbourhood
fieldwork, conducted in the spring and autumn of 1999, also included
doctors and nurses at a hospital and several dispensaries in charge of
public health, as well as teachers at a number of primary schools.
Building on the results of earlier studies,[^11/5] the combination of sociological
and anthropological research methods produced quantitative as well
as qualitative data on past and present which enabled us to determine
whether the former mill workers and their families had succeeded in
maintaining their standard of living after the sudden and dramatic
change in their working and living circumstances. As we shall see, for the
overwhelming majority of them, this proved impossible.

### Profile of Ex-Mill Workers

#### Origins

Four-fifths of the dismissed workers originate from Gujarat. Three fifths
were born in Ahmedabad or have lived in the city from early childhood.
These figures confirm that the majority of the workers in the textile
workers had strong ties with the city. Family histories show that grandfathers
and great-grandfathers were recruited from surrounding rural
districts to come and work in the mills. They were largely members of the
scheduled castes who found jobs in the expanding textile industry in
Ahmedabad through jobbers or fellow villagers who had preceded them.
The ties with the original village of origin have hardly survived, if at all,
among subsequent generations.

One group that reached the city in the first few decades of the
twentieth century and found work almost immediately as weavers in the
textile industry were _Patels_ from Saurashtra and North Gujarat. Their
number grew during the 1930s when agricultural employment and
income in the rural hinterland were badly hit by the recession. Economic
deterioration also motivated out-of-state migrants from as far away as

Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra to seek a better future in the
mills of Ahmedabad during the 1940s and 1950s. Did these late arrivals
have the option of returning to their villages after their dismissal? This
was certainly not true for those whom I interviewed in their old localities.
In most cases, their status as immigrants had become diluted after a
stay of several decades in the city. Their steadfastness in refusing to leave
the city was justified with the argument that there was no work 'at home',
and that the children had become so used to life in the city that they
would not be able to resettle in the countryside. The majority of longdistance
migrants gave these same reasons for not leaving Ahmedabad
after the closure of the mills to return to their villages in Rajasthan, Uttar
Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh or Maharasthra. Of course, I was unable to
speak to those who did return. But from what I was told by neighbours
and former workmates, non-Gujaratis accounted for less than a quarter
of the workforce in most mills. As I became more familiar with the
former textile districts, I found small communities of these U.P. _bhaiyas_
and Telangana _padmashalis_. Only a minority among these _pardeshis_
(outsiders) must have decided to leave the city after losing their jobs.

#### Gender and Age

With the exception of an almost negligible fraction of two to three %, the workers in the cotton mills were men. That was not always the
case. Until the early 1930s, women still accounted for a little under one
sixth of the total workforce. Two reasons were given for their gradual
removal from the workforce from that time onwards: the introduction of
protective legislation (exemption from heavy manual labour, special
provisions such as maternity leave and a ban on night work) and
technological advance (the replacement of the remaining manual tasks
by machines which women assumably were unable to operate). The
expulsion of women from the cotton mills in Ahmedabad, in which they
primarily worked in the spinning shops, occurred almost without protest
and with the approval --- even the insistence --- of the TLA of which they
were members (Jhabvala 1985). Another factor that contributed to this
gender imbalance was that only women from the lower castes were
permitted to engage in gainful employment outside the household. This
does not mean that female members of Muslim groups and the higher
ranking castes did not engage in paid labour, but that they largely
performed this work at home (see Jhabvala, Dhawan and Mahajan 1985
and others).

The survey showed that in 1998, 61% of the former mill
workers were older than 49 years of age.

: Age Composition of Former Mill Workers[^tab52-source]

[^tab52-source]: _Source_: Survey Breman and Patel 1998.

It should be noted here that most of them were between five and ten
years younger, and a few even 15 years younger, when they were made
redundant. A little over half of the workers included in the survey
worked in mills that closed before 1993. This meant that, for the
majority, this dramatic reversal in their fortunes occurred at or slightly
beyond the peak of their working life. But even when the discrepancy
between age at the time of dismissal and at the time of the interview was
compensated for, we still found that the under-25 age group was significantly
underrepresented in the statistics we had gathered. The reason for
this was that the mill management saw the crisis coming for a long time
and failed to replace older employees with younger ones as they retired in
the years preceding closure. A large-scale study initiated by Patel in 1984,
immediately after the first round of mass redundancies, showed that 60% of those who lost their jobs were between 25 and 44. From this
study emerged the profile of the average ex-mill worker which also plays
a central role in my analysis: male, with quite a few years of service but
with many still to go before retiring and becoming part of the noneconomically-active
population.

#### Marital status and Composition of the Household

550 of the 600 former mill workers included in the survey (more than 90%) reported that they were married. Of those who were single only
eight were unmarried, the remainder having lost their partners through
death or divorce. The large majority lived in households with no more
than five or six members, suggesting that in most cases the living unit
consisted of the core family of man, wife and children. Joint and multigenerational
households, which usually had more members, accounted
for a substantial minority of just under 30%. They were mostly the
result of married children living in with their parents or other relatives.
Four-fifths of the male respondents were the heads of their households.
The rest were their sons or brothers, while the few female respondents
were wives, mothers, or daughters.

#### Social Identity

The mill workforce consisted of four categories. The largest group were
workers from the scheduled castes. This segment, many members of
which referred to themselves as _Dalits_, made up more than 35% of
the survey population. Most of them were _Vankars_ and _Chamars_, castes
which were previously known in the rural economy of Gujarat as weavers
and leather workers respectively.

: Categorization according to Social Identity[^tab53-source]

[^tab53-source]: _Source_: Survey Breman and Patel 1998.

The OBC (other backward castes), known popularly in Gujarat as
_Baxi Panch_, consist of a wide range of castes which, like the SC (scheduled
castes), can benefit from the government policy of positive discrimination
intended to improve the socio-economic deprivation of all lower
castes. Among the redundant mill workers in Ahmedabad this label
applies to, amongst others, _Thakors_, _Vaghris_, Rabaris and Valand, the
first two of which are most numerous. The middle castes (16%)
include _Sonis_, _Rajputs_, _Darbars_ and _Jats_, but the _Patels_ outnumber all of
these castes together. Among the higher castes (4%), the most
prominent are the _Brahmans_ and _Baniyas_. The Muslims, too, are not a
homogeneous community but divided into a number of caste-like groups,
the most important of which are the _Mansuri Shaikhs_. The 'Other'
category includes the members of tribal castes, Christians, and non-Gujaratis
who were not classified by our field investigators as belonging
to any of the previous groups. On closer observation, most of the 'other'
proved to be _Dalit_ or _Baxi Panch_. This increases the size of the largest
group,
from the lowest social strata, to somewhere between just over half
and three fifths of the workforce of the mills. In proportion to their share
in the mill workforce, the Muslims are somewhat overrepresented in our
survey population, while the higher castes are slightly underrepresented.
This is because our survey focused on working class neighbourhoods
where the higher ranking mill employees preferred not to live. It can be
concluded from this outline of the complex social configuration of the
workforce that the mass of the workers employed in the lower echelons
of the mill hierarchy, some three quarters of the total, comprised almost
entirely of _Dalits_, _Baxi Panch_, and Muslims. It is on these bottom
segments that we have focused our attention.

#### Education and Job Training

Although the first few generations of mill workers were still illiterate, this
percentage fell rapidly as the twentieth century progressed. By the time
of the mill closures, according to our survey data, less than a sixth of
those who have lost their jobs in recent years were unable to read and
write.

One fifth of the survey population completed half of their primary
education and nearly one third completed their entire primary education.
This means that even among the least educated more than half can
read, write, and do arithmetic. A further group, a quarter of the total, has
at least some experience of the first years of secondary education and a
small minority was able to complete secondary school. A higher professional
or university education is far more exceptional, but the explanation
for these rare cases is that our survey included almost no former
members of the administrative, higher technical, or management staff.

Most of the lower ranks in the mill hierarchy, in which the majority of
the workers found themselves and stayed for the duration of their
working careers, were trained on the job. Newcomers were in effect
assigned tasks according to their social identity: spinning, weaving or in
one of the departments where the textiles were processed further. It took
several months to become skilled, by learning from an experienced
workmate. This was usually a family or caste member, quite often the
same person who had helped them find the job in the first place. Getting
a regular mill job was a tedious and lengthy process. The first stage was
to become registered as a reserve worker or _badli_. This meant reporting
for work every day but only actually working in the absence of one of the
regular members of the shift. It was quite common for workers to try and
get a temporary pass in more than one mill. To be considered for a
permanent job candidates had to turn up day in and day out, and even
then, sometimes after many years, they only succeeded with the help of
someone on the inside. Once they had found a permanent position,
upward or horizontal mobility was more the exception than the rule. The
opportunities for promotion never extended further than foreman or
supervisor, and the number of these somewhat elevated ranks were
limited. Transfer to a different department meant leaving the familiar
surroundings of one's own caste, a prospect which appealed to neither
the worker himself nor his new mates. A move to another mill was also
quite rare and was usually instigated by external factors, such as transfer
of part of the operation due to rationalization, a take-over of the
company, or total closure. It was perfectly normal for a worker to stay at
the same mill for the duration of his working life. Memories of their
former workplace often invoked strong emotions among our respondents.
One man told me, not without pathos, that the sound of the mill
whistle was forever engraved in his memory as the cry of a mother calling
her children home.

Spinning, which was known traditionally as an unclean activity, was
almost exclusively the domain of the _Dalit_ castes, as were many of the
tasks that preceded it (working the frame and throstle, reeling). In the
same way, a number of steps had to be taken before the actual weaving
started (winding, warping, sizing and drawing-in). The specialists in
these tasks were largely _Baxi Panch_ and Muslims. Weaving and further
processing of the textile up to the final phase in the production process
(batching, cropping, shearing, singeing, designing, bleaching and, lastly,
dyeing and printing) were the responsibility of the middle and higher
castes. This also applied to the finishing work, which was much less
labour intensive (drying, stretching, damping, calendering, folding and
packing). This long chain of activities was based on a complex division of
labour, within which three quarters of the mill workers were engaged in
spinning and weaving and related tasks. This work can be considered
reasonably skilled for two reasons: firstly, it entailed the operation of
machines, and, secondly, the rhythm of the work was closely linked to
the preceding and subsequent phases of production. Punctuality, regularity,
and precision were therefore required. The spinners and weavers
were not, of course, equipped with the kind of formal education enjoyed
by the technical and administrative staff, who accounted for somewhat
less than a tenth of the total workforce. On the other hand, they required
more professional skills than the considerable numbers of workers employed
in support functions, such as messengers and guards, cleaners and
catering staff. The close correlation between social identity and work in
the mill gave shape to a segmentation between the various departments
which closely reflected the pattern of communal segregation outside.

>It is a unique feature of the Ahmedabad Mills that each function in the
production process is divided according to the caste of the worker. Thus all
spinners are _Harijans_; weavers are _Patels_, Muslims, UP _bhaiyyas_ or Andhra
_padmashalis_. The frame department is manned by _Vaghris_ and so on. (Jhabvala
1985: 27; _see also_ Masihi 1985: 211).

The division along caste and religious lines was further accentuated by a
hierarchical structure which paralleled the finely graded stratification in
wider society: a very broad base where _Dalit_ castes, _Baxi Panch_ and
Muslims lived and worked in close proximity, with a smaller segment
above comprising members of middle and higher castes, engaged in
'cleaner' and more respected work.

#### Wages and Secondary Provisions

We based our estimate of the pay received by mill workers on the wage
level of 175 respondents who were made redundant in the four years
preceding our study. They were part of a group of 15,766 workers from
nine mills which were closed between 1994 and early 1998. For this
category it is still possible to make a meaningful comparison not only
between their incomes while working in the mills, but also between what
they have earned since being dismissed.

The wages in the cotton mills were standardized on the basis of an
agreed minimum, a dearness allowance, and an annual bonus equal to
one month's salary. In 1996, a shift worker working an eight-hour day for
six days a week would earn an average of ₹90 to 100 a day. The least
skilled workers could earn as little as ₹60 a day, while the highest scale,
for which technical specialists were eligible, was ₹175 a day. The wages
of experienced spinners and weavers, who made up the mass of the
workforce, varied from ₹2,000 to 2,500 a month. Until the early
1980s, the textile workers were among the best paid industrial workers in
India. This had much to do with the strong position of the trade union
movement which had developed in the textile industry in the early
twentieth century. The crisis which swept through the whole country
from the late 1970s and which caused such a dramatic decrease in the
number of people working in the textile industry, did not result in a fall
in real wages but wiped out the lead this sector had previously enjoyed in
terms of income. Within a comparatively short time, wages were lagging
behind those in other sectors of heavy industry, such as metal and
machine manufacture. This relative deterioration did not change the fact
that, right up to the time that the mills closed, the textile workers
enjoyed a much better standard of living than the large majority of the
labouring classes in Ahmedabad, who had to survive outside the formal
sector of the economy. This gap was not only a matter of actual earnings
per day, week, or month. There was also a whole range of perquisites that
entitled the mill workers and their families to low-cost or free provisions,
including medical insurance, sick pay, paid leave, a savings scheme in the
form of a provident fund to which the employer contributed half of the
monthly premium and which was used to finance the workers' pension,
and access to cheap credit from the mill's own credit bank to help cover
major expenses. Lastly, the employer sometimes provided free or lowrent
accommodation, usually in the immediate vicinity of the mill.

From the above, we can construct a profile of the average textile
worker, typical of the thousands who have lost their jobs during the last
two decades as a result of the closure of the mills. This would be a male
between 30 and 45 years old, mostly born in the city or at least with
strong roots in the urban milieu, married and the head of his household,
literate and possessing skills acquired on the job, a member of a lower
caste or religious minority giving him a vulnerable social identity, with a
permanent job contract in the formal sector of the economy, providing a
reasonable to good wage and a wide range of secondary benefits, and a
member of a powerful trade union to defend his interests.

The terms of employment of textile workers with permanent jobs in
the cotton mills protected them against dismissal, regulated wage
negotiations and compliance with the agreements reached, limited the
length of the working day and the working week and ensured the
payment of overtime, enforced safety and hygiene in the mill, specified
leave entitlements, recognized seniority as the basic principle for the
division of labour, and established procedures for airing grievances and
settling disputes, including the right of appeal. All of these provisions
were embedded in industrial legislation and an institutional framework
for consultation in which government bodies and employers
and employees' organizations participated. The acceptance of these tripartite
procedures for bargaining was due to the advent of the trade
union movement. Acknowledging the need for representation, most mill
workers were members of the TLA right up to the day they lost their
jobs.

### Dismissal and Compensation

The mill closures in the last quarter of the twentieth century came as a
great shock to the workers. Even among those who had lost their jobs in
the first round of closures, the memory of this turning point in their lives
continues to invoke deep emotion to the present day. But was their
dismissal really a bolt from the blue? That is very unlikely, particularly in
the later years. After all, many others had suffered the same fate before.
In most cases, the writing had been on the wall for their own mill for a
long time, in the form of a negative annual balance of accounts year after
year. These recurrent losses interrupted the regular flow of production
and suppliers were only prepared to deliver raw materials on a cash basis.
Workers were sent home for days or weeks on end because there was
nothing for them to do, and were told there was no money to pay their
wages. Vacancies as a result of retirement or failing health were no longer
filled, the third shift was discontinued and whole departments closed for
an unspecified period. These measures were obviously a cause for concern
but, since such interruptions or reductions had been recurrent
events during the 1960s and 1970s, it was perhaps understandable that
the end still came as a surprise to many when production stopped for
good.

I have already discussed management failure as a major cause for the
collapse of the corporate enterprises. For many years, when business was
booming, the owners had refused to opt for industrial modernization.
They continued to use machines and buildings, although they were
totally worn out. Instead of investing in their companies the owners
siphoned capital off to other branches of activity. Due to lack of adequate
financial means, profits started to fall from the 1960s onwards. This
strategy of underinvestment, characteristic of mercantile rather than
industrial entrepreneurship, ultimately led to the closure or sale of the
mill, which had been drained of its earlier value. This is an old complaint,
already pointed out by the prominent Congress politician Morarji
Desai, otherwise a strong proponent of private enterprise, when he
became Minister of Commerce and Industry in the national cabinet
in 1951.

>One important and major factor which has driven many of these units to the
desperate action of closing down is, perhaps, the continued neglect and to a large
extent, though not always deliberate, definite inefficiency and short-sightedness
on the part of the management in not ploughing back surplus resources, when
they were available, for the much needed rehabilitation and rejuvenation of the
mills. The profits and earnings were just frittered away. (Quoted in: Leadbeater
1993: 226)

The tendency to underinvest has been explained in the literature by
referring to unwillingness, first by late-colonial and then by post-colonial
government, to provide the large-scale textile industry with the market
protection it desired. In disagreement with this interpretation, it can be
argued that the captains of industry in Ahmedabad steadfastly refused to
accept responsibility for the normal risk of production themselves.
Instead, they passed on this risk to labour by insisting on low wages and
by intensifying the workload. They tried to get away with keeping
investment of their own capital at the lowest possible level and by
diverting their profits to other business ventures. In the end this industrial
strategy could not but lead to the closure of the mills.

The final curtain fell when the electricity was cut off because the bill
had not been paid, or when a creditor had the mill declared bankrupt. In
either case, it would be the owner himself who provoked this intervention
to evade his legal duty to give prior notice of his intention to close
the mill. His standard reaction was that he had not made the decision
himself and of his own free will. By claiming _force majeure_ he could
defend himself against accusations that he had not fulfilled his statutory
obligations. These included primarily a fair redundancy scheme based on
years of service, and other compensations for the untimely and unilateral
termination of the labour contract, for the now superfluous workforce.
By the time the mill closed the owner had already withdrawn the capital
he had invested in his enterprise during the preceding period. In many
cases, the management also tried to transfer the mill records elsewhere,
remove any remaining stock and raw materials, and dismantle the looms
and other machines to be sold for scrap. For their part the alarmed
workers tried to prevent these secretive and illegal practices by picketing
the mill gates and searching all vehicles.

Did the union also take action when the crisis became manifest? It
certainly responded to the first wave of closures in the early 1980s.
Instant protest meetings were staged when the owner of a company
announced that the gates were going to be shut, this time for good.
Marches through the city centre drew large crowds. Politicians and
government agencies were called upon in no uncertain terms to intervene.
As the years passed and it became clear that the entire branch of industry
was in deep crisis, the earlier agitation which resonated through the city
dissipated. The municipal authorities were quick to defuse all signs of
restiveness. Each subsequent closure seemed to affect only the immediate
victims. Their reaction was as predictable as it was futile and seemed to
have lost its power to arouse public opinion.

And yet there was still hope for a return to better times. In the 1970s,
within the framework of the centrally planned economy, the state and its
agencies showed themselves willing to prevent the shutdown of 'sick'
private industries by transferring them to the public sector. The strategy
was to inject new capital and to rationalize production, so that companies
could continue as viable concerns with a smaller but more efficient
workforce. To implement this policy of industrial reorganization the
National Textile Corporation was established in 1974 and ample funds
were allocated to improve management and cut down on labour cost. In
1986, the Gujarat State Textile Corporation was launched under the
Gujarat Closed Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Act, with a mandate
to restructure twelve closed corporate mills into five or six revitalized
enterprises. Both state corporations failed in their primary objective:
to save, through technological and operational modernization, at least
some of the jobs lost. But the workers who were eventually brought
under the public sector regime at least had the advantage that their
redundancy rights remained intact. They received all their back pay, the
money they had built up in the provident fund, a retrenchment allowance
based on their years of service, and a small redundancy bonus of ₹1,000 if they left voluntarily. The workers in mills threatened with
closure therefore hoped that the company would be taken over by NTC
or GSTC. They might lose their jobs, but they would at least be assured
of receiving the savings and other dues owed to them. At the start of
1997, the GSTC controlled over 19 mills in Ahmedabad which formerly
employed 22,000 workers. Of these, almost 8,000 were pressurized to
take voluntary redundancy between 1991 and 1996, while the remaining
14,000 lost their jobs between late 1996 and early 1997. This, too,
was officially on a voluntary basis, but in reality it was because the Board
of Industrial and Financial Restructuring (BIFR) refused to allow the
GSTC to continue operating, after it had exhausted its funds at a rate of
₹600 million a year. The NTC was in charge of 10 mills in the city,
which used to employ 23,200 workers. Of these, 12,800 had been
railroaded into taking advantage of the voluntary redundancy scheme
between 1991 and 1996. The remaining 10,400 received what was
called 'idle wages': although production in these mills had come to a halt,
they continued to be paid, albeit irregularly and not in full.

The industrial economy, which since Independence had been largely
based on central planning and control, had gradually made way for a
policy in which production and sales were increasingly determined by
the free market. Liberalization of the flow of capital, inputs and outputs
was accompanied by increasing flexibility in industrial relations. This
turnaround, which peaked in 1991, was followed a year later by the
setting up of a National Renewal Fund. The aim of the fund was, in the
first place, to provide cash compensation and retraining for the workers
who had become superfluous and, in the second place, to finance the
creation of new jobs (Mehta 1985; Hirway 1995). However, instead of
being used to achieve these objectives, the largest part of the budget for
the fund was spent on the voluntary redundancy of workers in mills that
had been taken over by the government. But, even among them, the
programme was not received with great enthusiasm. Those who were
targeted were put under pressure by the TLA leadership, who warned
them that they were running the risk of losing all their acquired rights in
case they decided to hang on to their precious jobs (Mehta 1995: 605;
Chowdhury 1996: L12, Patel 1997: 21; Noronha 1999: 99). Because
the amount of severance pay was linked to years of service, it was only the
older employees who were tempted to go for voluntary redundancy.
What had been proclaimed as a social safety net was seen by the
recipients as meagre compensation for the loss of their protected right to
income from regular employment. Yet the few workers who were eligible
for these state-sponsored redundancy schemes from mills were in an
enviable position.

The many more who had worked in mills that had remained in
private hands until closure not only received no compensation at all for
their redundancy --- which should have been equal to a sliding scale from
75% of their last salary initially, to 25% at the end of a
three-year period --- but were often dismissed without even being
paid the full amount that should have been deposited in their account as
long as they worked. Mehta and Harode made a rough calculation of
how much the dismissed textile workers in Gujarat missed out on in
total:

> ... 72,840 workers of 46 mills have not received their statutory ₹228 crore. This
works out at ₹31,293 per worker. The dues include wages, bonus, gratuity,
retrenchment allowance and some others. These dues might not have been paid
since many mills were closed way back in the 1980s. This is their lifetime
earnings. (Mehta and Harode 1998: 79--80).

Such unequal treatment made the shock of dismissal even more intense.
The amount of redundancy pay --- indeed whether they received payment
at all --- was in no way related to their service record. A small
minority were 'lucky' and received what they were entitled to, but the
large majority who were unlucky enough not to be dismissed in the last
instance by the government got too little or nothing at all. This is an
injustice which the victims fail to understand and which they experience
as extremely unjust.

: Compensation Received[^tab55-source]

[^tab55-source]: _Source_: Survey Breman and Patel 1998.

Table 5.5 shows that almost a third of the workers included in the
survey received compensation of between nothing and ₹25,000, and
two-thirds less than ₹50,000. A little over a tenth worked in mills
operated by the GSTC or NTC. Most respondents were unable to give
any accurate information on the composition of the payments they
received, but said that the largest part (or the entire amount) came from
the provident fund. At the time of our survey in 1998--99, the conflict
surrounding redundancy payments was still raging. These strong sentiments
are not being kept alive only by the huge scale of the outstanding
claims. In addition to the economic loss, the militancy has also an
emotional side: the bitter memory of the days when labour enjoyed
security and protection. The sense of betrayal and disillusionment was
pervasive for instance in the conversations I had when I visited the
Ahmedabad Advance Mill, closed since 1995. Several dozen redundant
workers continue to meet on the last Saturday morning of each month to
hear whether there was any news on the court case against their former
employer. The leader of the action committee maintained contact with a
lawyer who had agreed to represent them in exchange for a percentage of
the compensation they were demanding. They assemble in a small
temple in the factory grounds, close to a statue of the mill's founder,
Jamshedji N. Tata. The bust was presented to the company in 1953 on
the occasion of its golden jubilee, as a token of the workers' gratitude.
And daily a thin stream of workers still turns up at the TLA office to
enquire after the progress or outcome of court cases lodged on their
behalf by the union against _malafide_ mill owners guilty of breach of
contract on many counts. My own research findings and those of many
others confirm that the exit policy has had a strong anti-labour bias. The
preconceived strategy on the side of employers could not have succeeded
without the collusion, overt and covert, of the trade union as well as the
state government.

### The Failure of Union and Government

The former mill workers primarily hold the owners responsible for what
has happened to them. The latter had discovered that it was cheaper to
wind up their companies and transfer production to small-scale workshops
where they did not have to comply with labour legislation or invest
their capital in new and more profitable business enterprises. Although
the closures, were thus, a direct result of a strategy of cheap labour,
neither government nor the trade union opposed the transfer of production
away from the mills and were therefore docile accessories to the mass
redundancies.

I can fully understand the resentment and anger of the retrenched
workers. After all, more than any other organization, the TLA professed
to have fought to improve the lot of the working masses in the cotton
mills. It was the only union authorized to negotiate with the employers
on terms of employment. Its mandate as 'representative union' dated
back to the late-colonial era and was reaffirmed in the Bombay Industrial
Relations Act of 1947. The authoritarian manner in which the TLA was
governed was in keeping with this hegemonic position. Gandhi introduced
the name _mahajan_, in the sense of a guild, but it was also used in
terms of an exclusive elite who made all the important decisions affecting
their clientele amongst themselves. All the TLA's leaders were co-opted
because of their Gandhian leanings. Not a single one had ever been a
worker or even a shop steward himself.

In the eyes of the workers, this top-down way of operating has been
characteristic of the TLA's management style from the very beginning.
The General Secretary, whom I met on several occasions during my
fieldwork between 1998 and 2000, has been in office for more than forty
years, and the other senior members of the union board have been there
just as long. Together they determined the policy of the union, acted as
its representatives in dealings with outsiders and were accustomed to
informing, instructing, and directing the rank and file in an authoritarian-paternalistic
fashion. This model of leadership left no room for
accountability or even the minimum participation by members in appointing,
promoting, or dismissing their highest officials. Together with
the ideological choice to avoid militancy in favour of harmony and
cooperation with the captains of industry, and for compromise as the
basic means of settling disputes, this explains the detachment and the
conspicuous lack of decisiveness with which the TLA responded to the
mass redundancies of nine-tenths of its members during the protracted
crisis in the textile industry. At an early stage, after the first wave of mill
closures between 1982 and 1984, Joshi delivered a scathing attack on the
TLA's inertia.

>The prime objective of a union is to struggle for security of service, wages and
emoluments. When composite textile mills were being closed down and nearly
50,000 workers were made jobless, the representative union kept a low profile
and agreed to the plans like restructuring of mills, early and premature retirement
of workers, opening of just seven mills and rehabilitation of only 5,000
workers. It was a mute spectator when old machinery was being shifted to new
sites. It did not struggle for workers' rights. It agreed to almost all the plans of the
management and the Government. An ex-member of the Second Labour Law
Review Committee writes ... 'the phenomenon of company union is not
unknown in India. As a member of the Second Labour Law Review Committee
of the Government of Gujarat, I was astonished to find verbatim similarity in the
representations of the _Majoor Mahajan and Ahmedabad Textile Millowners'
Association_ (ATMA).' (Joshi 1987: 155)

There was very little evidence of even a moderately effective defence of
interests safeguarded under industrial legislation. This neglect of its
primary task by the TLA leadership seems to be coming to an end as this
union --- with such a glorious past --- now faces extinction. Towards the
end of my fieldwork in late 2000, the membership had dwindled to
15,000 and even this number may have been exaggerated. The rapid
decline from 1979 onwards, when the TLA counted 135,445 members
(Sharma 1980: 4), was a source of acute embarrassment in conversations
with those still in office. These are all men in the latter years of their lives
who have had to accept that the union's annual expenditure is now
higher than its income, the few senior leaders still around are far beyond
their age of retirement and the huge, three-storey office building is nearly
empty of staff and activity. It would be grossly incorrect, however, to
attribute this sad collapse of a major trade union solely to the crisis in the
textile industry. The reputation of the TLA was irrevocably linked to the
Congress Party, a political alliance which continued after Independence.
When the Congress split in 1969, the union leadership decided to
remain aloof from politics. As a consequence of this decision, the once
active lobby representing formal sector labour interests lost all the
leverage it had both at the state and national level. The former mill
workers have been broken up into fragmented and fluid vote banks,
shopped around between the local agents of the political powers that be.

Many ex-mill workers told me in no uncertain terms that they were
thoroughly disillusioned about the refusal of the TLA, in the first place,
to take a more decisive stand to prevent the redundancies and, in the
second place, to ensure that they received all the compensation and other
payments to which they were entitled. There was great consternation
when, as early as 1984, workers who had lost their jobs besieged the
union office for days on end to express their displeasure at the passive
response of the leaders and to demand a more resolute opposition to the
high-handed activities of the industrialists.

>Under the leadership of a technician, Mahendrabhai Shah, three of the technical
workers went on fast until death at the gate of the TLA office. It caused a stir
amongst TLA workers and the leaders. ... Fasting technician, Mahendrabhai
Shah, during talks with him said, 'On the very first evening of fasting, TLA
president Arvindbhai Buch had come to meet us. He was very angry. He
immediately asked me: 'Why have you gone on fast, here?' I said. 'We are
members of TLA, where else can we go?' Arvind Buch: 'Are you members of any
Party? It seems that somebody has misled you. What kind of farce you are staging
here?' I said: 'We do not belong to any party. We want that at any cost, mills must
be re-opened. Do you consider this as a farce? To us, it is a question of life and
death and you think that it is a farce! In fact, you should cooperate with us! (Jani
1984: 20--1).

In a half-hearted attempt to regain the initiative, Arvind Buch, who had
led 'the righteous struggle' for several decades as President of the TLA,
decided to adopt a form of direct action. Claiming that he would fight
for a better deal, the veteran leader took to the streets and in good
Gandhian fashion set himself up on 1 May 1994 on the footpath in front
of the union office as a show of public support for the dismissed workers.

>The instrumentalities of the demonstration were defined strictly in accordance
with the Gandhian methodology of resolution of political conflicts, i.e., as
peaceful, non-violent agitation, designed to generate moral pressure on the
central government and to raise public awareness of the plight of the jobless
workers. The specific modality adopted by the organisers of the _satyagraha_ was to
construct a makeshift pandal outside the TLA premises in the crowded Lal
Darwaza area of the city; Buch shifted his office from the TLA premises to this
location. Jobless textile workers gather and sit around on charpoys; at infrequent
intervals, someone gives a short speech, or there is a recital of an inspiring song
or verse. There are no provocative political speeches. The _dharna_ starts at 10 am
and is over at noon. While in the initial weeks, a fairly impressive crowd had
gathered at the site, and prominent labour leaders had shown up to address the
workers, both public and worker enthusiasm over the _dharna_ subsided fairly
quickly. At present only a handful of workers (never more than 20 on a typical
morning) appear at the site. The elderly and ailing Buch spends much of the
morning writing letters, and part of it talking to the workers. (Chowdhury 1996: 11).

The author adds that, in spite of the fact that the union formally
supported the _satyagraha_, the other leaders kept their distance from
Buch's peaceful agitation. Their refusal to join TLA's boss as a belated
Indulal Yagnik indicated a serious split at the apex body of the union and
was one of the main reasons why the protest made little impression on
public opinion. Even the workers who were drummed up to appear in
front of the office every day lost interest, because they saw the ritual as
serving no other purpose than that of a joint mourning session. The
members' mistrust of their leaders was fuelled by the understanding and
consent with which the latter responded to the mill closures. In the early
stages of the decline of this large-scale branch of industry, Arvind Buch
had written a memorandum on behalf of the TLA entitled 'Scrapping
Without Tears', which proposed the setting up of a tripartite council of
representatives of employees, employers, and government agencies to
ensure that the inevitable process of cutting back and trimming down
the large number of composite mills that found themselves in a state of
insolvency proceeded smoothly and successfully. His plan assumed that
the employers and the government would provide the money necessary
to finance the rationalization process and ensure that the workers'
statutory rights were respected, in exchange for which the latter would
voluntarily give up their jobs at the mills (Mookherjee 1987: 137--8). In
1994, Sanat Mehta, another pillar of the labour movement and a former
minister of finance in Gujarat, launched a similar plan aimed at reforming
the urban economy of Ahmedabad.

>The once proud textile workers have seen their earnings snatched from their
hands and have been forced to join the ranks of the ever-growing marginalised
labour force. Their wages are not only left unpaid, even their rightful statutory
dues which include their lifelong savings on account of earned leave, due bonus,
and gratuity dues have not been paid to them. It was in this climate that the
Textile Labour Association (TLA), which is the main representative union of
Ahmedabad's textile workers with guidance from Shri Sanat Mehta and Shri
Arvind Buch, took a bold and farsighted view that since it would not be possible
to restart the older textile mills in their original form, it was necessary to support
the new liberal economic policy. This stance and the Association's other local
initiatives led to the commissioning of a study of closed textile mills in the city.
The subsequent findings and recommendations of the study were accepted by
the workers. (S. Mehta 1994: 1--2)

In line with the 'democratic' style which the TLA has always pretended
to follow, the authors claim to have consulted the members to get their
consent for acceptance of the New Textile Policy. Their draft plan
included taking out a loan from the National Renewal Fund to compensate
the redundant mill workers and to create alternative jobs. This loan
was to be repaid by selling the land, buildings and equipment of the
closed mills. The peaceful protest initiated by Arvind Buch was intended
to pressurize politicians and the government to adopt this scheme for a
small-scale industrial development model built along cooperative lines
(S. Mehta 1994; B.E. Mehta n.d.).

The Ahmedabad Local Economy Rejuvenation Trust (ALERT),
founded by Buch and Mehta, has never become operational. The closed
mills add to the pauperized condition of the former industrial districts.
Many of these buildings, obsolete even when they were still standing,
have been demolished. The compounds have again turned into wasteland,
used by the inhabitants of the surrounding localities as public
toilets, a playground for children, and dumping sites for garbage. The
fundamental change in economic policy that occurred during the early
1990s meant that designs for small-scale industrial renovation, as envisaged
by the trade union leadership, were doomed in advance. State
regulation and plan-based production made way for the free market.
This not only put an end to the state taking over 'sick' companies, but
also meant that bodies such as the NTC and the GSTC could no longer
depend on public funds to rationalize the nationalized industrial enterprises
and were disbanded. During the first wave of closures, ministers
and prominent politicians would still appear at the mills to address the
assembled workers. They promised that the mills would be reopened or,
failing that, full redundancy pay and new jobs. But as the dismantling of
the industry progressed, these VIPs showed their faces less and less
frequently in the textile districts of the city. In retrospect Sanat Mehta
spoke bitter words in parliament about the total disregard for labour laws
when the workers were dismissed.

>Whatever number of textile mills were closed down, they were closed down
without following any procedures laid down in the Industrial Dispute Act
(Mehta 1997).

The flexibilization of the labour market that accompanied this policy of
deregulation meant that employment was no longer governed by the
industrial legislation put in place in the years before and after Independence.
The impact on the dismissed labour force in Ahmedabad will be
dealt with in the subsequent chapters. Here I have focused on the
government's steadfast refusal to ensure compliance with the body of
legal provisions that safeguarded the rights of the workers up to the time
that they were dismissed. The frontal attack by government and private
business during the last decade on what has been labelled as 'labour
market rigidities' suggests that the existing framework of industrial
relations, aimed at protecting conditions of employment, is seen as a
major obstacle in the new economic policy designed to replace state
regulation by the free market mechanism. From my analysis it will have
become clear that neither big business nor government abided with the
legal provisions when the mill workers lost their formal sector jobs. State
agencies systematically failed to exercise political and administrative and
legal pressure on the mill owners to fulfil their obligations towards their
employees. I have already referred to the maleficent and fraudulent
manner in which most of the closures took place, but there were almost
no cases of captains of industry being prosecuted, let alone punished, for
their illegal actions. I should note that the TLA leadership took steps to
ensure that its members received all the money owed to them and full
redundancy pay by threatening to sue owners who were in default. This
was a slow and costly process that usually ended with a settlement and
payment of a much lower sum than had been claimed. And the costs of
legal assistance also had to be covered from the meagre fruits of this
victory. Rumours were rife in the textile districts that union leaders were
in cahoots with the bosses and were putting part of the redundancy
money into their own pockets. These suspicions were fuelled by the fact
that the TLA asked a fee to finance disputes with the employers. The
commission --- two % of the final payment --- was the cause of much
controversy and, according to one calculation, earned the union some ₹16.5 million (Howell and Kambhampati 1997: 45). But in addition to
this institutional deduction many ex-mill workers who received compensation
money had to pay 'a fee' to members of the administrative staff
of the TLA for unspecified services rendered.

Takeover by the NTC or GSTC was a precondition for the success of
workers' claims against reluctant employers. The chances of this happening
were greater in the early years of closure. Workers who were lucky
enough to gain public employee status before losing their jobs could
count on a redundancy payment from the National Renewal Fund. But
even then, and contrary to earlier promises, the majority of them did not
receive the full amount they were due. This privilege was restricted to
managerial staff members, whose exit was often accompanied by a
golden handshake (Howell and Kambhampati 1997: 40). The lower
one's position in the mill hierarchy, the greater the chance of being put
out on the street with little or nothing. This state of affairs confirmed my
conclusion that the excessive inequality in the treatment of the redundant
workers, both between and within companies, considerably intensified
the misery of the loss of job and livelihood. One indication of the
scale of this failure to pay redundant workers their full dues was provided
by the General Secretary of the TLA, who told me in the course of a
conversation at the end of 1999 that so far the former mill workers had
received no more than one-fifth of the total compensation and other
payments to which they were entitled. This was much less than what the
textile labourers in Mumbai were given when they were dismissed in the
years between 1980 and 2000. In this metropolis, which also used to be
dominated by the textile industry, a more alert representation of workers'
interests insisted on payment of all statutory dues as well as compensation
for termination of the labour contract.[^11/6]

The righteous struggle in Ahmedabad has ended in dismal failure. A
poem, written by one of the victims, expressed their anger and betrayal.
That mood is still very much there.
