## The Formalization of Collective Action

### Mahatma Gandhi As A Union Leader

The expansion of the textile industry gathered momentum with the
outbreak of the First World War. Domestic sales increased as imports of
clothing from Lancashire ceased, while production for other markets in
Asia experienced spectacular growth. The number of mills remained
roughly the same, slightly above 50 (see table 1.1), but the capacity of the
spinning and weaving shops expanded significantly. This was accompanied
by expansion of the working population, a process that was expedited
by the change to a two-shift system of production. With each shift
lasting 12 hours, the machines were in operation day and night during
the war years.

The extremely high profits made by the textile magnates were an
indication of the low wages during this period. The employers were
forced, however, to grant a bonus in mid 1917 when workers threatened
to leave the city _en masse_ after an outbreak of the plague. To induce them
to stay they were offered a bonus of 70% of their regular wage. The
warpers, who traditionally came from the city, were not included in the
bonus scheme because it was assumed that they would have no rural
place of origin to return to. On 4 December 1917, they downed tools.
Because of the symbolic nature of this protest, that date much later (from
1936 onwards) came to be commemorated as _Majoor Din_ (Labour Day).
The agitation was a modest success to the extent that it resulted in a
somewhat lower wage rise of 20% for this category of workers.
When, shortly afterwards, the epidemic was over, the employers announced
that they were going to abolish the plague bonus, but raise
original wage levels somewhat, although by no means enough to compensate
for the dramatically increased cost of living during the war years.
This amounted to a deterioration of earnings in real terms, and _encountered_
strong resistance in the mills. Anasuyaben, who had been involved
in the previous strike, declared herself once again willing to help the
workers in the struggle for justice. Her brother, the city's leading captain
of industry, was aware that further concessions would be inevitable to
avoid industrial conflict. In his role as AMA president he contacted
Gandhi, who had settled in Ahmedabad in 1915 after his return from
South Africa. The Ahmedabad Collector, who was afraid that the city
would suffer the same kind of unrest as had taken place in Bombay, also
asked the leader of the nationalist movement to mediate in the dispute.
Lastly, as the spokeswoman of the mill workers, Anasuyaben called on
Gandhi to help. The strike which broke out in February 1918 was the
result of the refusal of the employers to increase wages by more than 20% and their resolute rejection of the claim made by the workers for
a 50% pay rise. After hesitating because he already had an overfull
agenda, Gandhi agreed to arbitrate if both sides showed themselves
willing to abide by the decision of a small committee. This would
comprise a few representatives of the employers, while he himself ---
together with Banker and Vallabhbhai Patel --- would represent the interests
of the workers. A section of the workers refused to return to work
until the committee had reached a decision, thus giving the employers an
excuse to shut down the entire production process.

After having informed himself of the increased cost of living and the
companies' high profits, Gandhi advised the workers to accept a provisional
pay rise of 35%. The strike continued, but remained
peaceful in spite of the unrest in the industrial districts. Gandhi ordered
Anasuyaben to impose a fine on a worker who, in anger, had the temerity
to strike the secretary of the AMA with a stick. At five o'clock in the
evening on the dot, Gandhi addressed the strikers at a quiet spot on the
river bank. He urged them not to give up their righteous struggle, to
clean their homes and, now that they had time on their hands, to increase
their knowledge by reading, or by learning to read, to make up for their
lost earnings by seeking other gainful work --- such as digging sand in the
Sabarmati river for the construction of his ashram --- and to ask neither
more nor less than they deserved, i.e. to demand a just wage. After three
weeks, the resistance of the workers appeared to reach breaking point.
The employers took advantage of this visible loss of morale to encourage
the workers to accept their original offer to return to work. They pledged
not to dismiss anyone who was willing-to-pass through the mill gates
again. _En route_ one of his daily sermons Gandhi suffered a deluge of
criticism from the workers. They said that he did not seem to mind
driving around in Sarabhai's car --- the first motorized vehicle in the
city --- and dining at his luxurious bungalow, while the workers were
going hungry (Desai 1951: 25--6). The shock of these accusations
provoked Gandhi to pledge that he would fast to death as a final attempt
get the industrialists to accept his offer. This was the first time that he
made this sacrifice not from a desire for personal purification but for a
public cause. His dramatic gesture had the desired effect as the employers,
who had proved so immutable, had little choice than to surrender to
this form of pressure with a religious tint. The eventual wage increase
amounted actually to somewhat less than 35%, but this was so
that the employers did not lose face. Although the final outcome was less
than satisfactory, the leaders declared that the 'righteous struggle' had
been won (Patel 37--42; Lakha 1988: 103--7).

Gandhi's view of the relationship between capital and labour was
founded on his rejection of the industrial system in Western society. In
India, arrangements were traditionally determined by family ties. Apprentices
did not have the moral right to ask their masters for higher.
wages at times when labour was scarce while, conversely, the masters
were duty-bound to resist the temptation to lower wages when labour
was in plentiful supply. The social doctrine taught by Gandhi reflected
the classical harmonious partnership between patron and client that was
believed to have existed in the past and which should be continued in the
modern age. This view concurred with the custom in the mills in
Ahmedabad to refer to the workers as parivar, members of the extended
family to which the owner and the managers also belonged (Barot 1997: viii).

The way in which industrial protest was conducted determined the
strategy and tactics of the trade union which was founded shortly after
the strike. It is illuminating to note that Gandhi first ordered his
associates to gather information on the standard and way of living of the
working people. In January 1918, before the strike broke out, he wrote:

>I think our first task is to make a careful survey of the conditions of the working
class. What does the worker earn? Where does he live? In what condition? How
much does he spend? How much does he save? What debts does he incur? How
many children has he? How does he bring them up? What was he previously?
What brought about the change in his life? What is his present condition? It does
not seem to be proper at all to start a cooperative society straightaway, without
finding answers to all these questions. It is necessary that we go into the midst of
the working class. If we do, we can solve a number of problems in a very short
time. For the moment I should advise you to mix with the workers and make
yourself familiar with their condition. (Kamath and Kher 1993: 96)

Banker would have preferred to hold out for an initial wage rise of 50%. He considered such an increase more than justified, because he
based his calculations not only on what was necessary for a reasonable
standard of living but also on the proven affluence of the industry itself,
which had made unprecedented profits in the previous years and thus
could easily afford such a rise in labour costs. If the owners rejected this
demand, then they should provide substantial funds for housing, health
care, schooling, and social work in the industrial districts. By way of
response to this argument, Anasuyaben's brother declared indignantly,
on behalf of the employer's association, that running a business was not
a philanthropic endeavour and that employers were not bound to ensure
that their workers could enjoy the same standard of living as they
themselves. Did the poverty in which the workers were reputed to live
not come, after all, from their own unwillingness to diligently perform
the duties that had been entrusted to them? If they could resist their own
tendency to shirk their responsibilities, the increase in productivity
would allow them to enjoy a far higher income. No matter what the
circumstances, this could not be allowed to question the fundamentals of
how they ran their businesses. Sarabhai expressed this in the following
words:

>In reality mills are run with no other motive than to make profit and, therefore,
employment of labour and conditions of employment are determined purely on
the basis of supply and demand and from the point of view of their efficiency.
This is as it should be ... Mr. Banker's approach is impossible, unachievable,
visionary and utopian. (Majmundar 1973: 81)

The settlement of disputes through a willingness to compromise, that is
through negotiation rather than confrontation, and by implication the
acceptance of arbitration and a commitment to abide by its outcome,
were the core aspects of the trade union that emerged during this period
of unrest. Adhering to these principles not only made the negotiations
with the employers a difficult task, but also demanded a great effort on
the part of the union's leaders to instil into their members the discipline
that they were said to lack. Gandhi presented the working class with a
code of good conduct. This catechism, which had to be strictly enforced,
was at the top of the agenda of the union and became a determining
factor in the industrial face of the city over the subsequent half century.
The workers were instilled with the code, in the form of a treatise,
summarized by Barot (1997: 34) in the following words:

1.
Demands made by the workers must be fair and genuine, based on facts and
figures, and neither inflated or exaggerated;
2.
Weapon of strike should be treated as a last resort, after all peaceful methods
and negotiations, conciliation and arbitration are exhausted.
3.
Peaceful and non-violent behaviour is the _sine qua non_ for obtaining
justice. Violence and gherao (confinement of management staff to their
office) have no place in saytagraha (peaceful campaign of resistance).
4. Workers should be self-reliant and self-respecting. Their attitude should
   always be truthful, courageous, just and free from hatred. They should
   always be prepared for voluntary sacrifices keeping undeterred faith in God.

The righteous struggle (_dharma yuddh_) had now acquired an institutional
setting in an organization whose aim was to improve the lot of its
members. The union was founded nearly 30 years after the employers
had established their own association to regulate the labour problem in
their own way. Anasuyaben was appointed president for life of the union,
launched on 25 February 1920 and named _Majoor Mahajan Sangh_. As
the most prominent member of the advisory committee Gandhi set the
agenda and saw to it that the new organization did not stray from its
chosen course. Gandhi would retain this pivotal position until his death.
Workers have never, then or later, been elected to the union leadership,
nor have they ever been present whenever outsiders, according to the
proposed rules of arbitration, met behind closed doors to deliberate on
their claims and complaints. _Mahajan_ was the name given to the guilds
in which the merchants and financiers had joined hands in pre-industrial
Ahmedabad to conduct their business. The use of a term that symbolized
the past commercial glory of the city can be explained in two ways.
Firstly, it had an emancipatory sound to it, assigning labour the same
dignity as that claimed by worthy businessmen. Secondly, as a prominent
union leader explains, used in combination the words _Majoor_ and
_Mahajan_ represented the partnership, as envisaged by Gandhi, between
employee and employer (Barot 1997: vii). The same author reports that,
at the gathering to celebrate the foundation of the union, Gandhi
advised Anasuyaben to base her work for the organization on service and
not leadership. When she asked him what he meant, he replied:

>_Sevak_ acts like a mother and attends to cure the ailments and even gives bitter
medicines while _Sardar_ acts like a politician and does all sorts of manoeuvres to
keep up his position. A trade union leader should act like a _Sevak_ and not as a
_Sardar_. (Barot 1997: 53)

In urging Anasuyaben to act like a mother, Gandhi was also impressing
on her the need to discipline the working masses prompted by the fear
that the progressive political mobilization of the workers, such as union
leaders in Bombay and elsewhere were propagating, would be counterproductive
to the interests of the nationalist movement (see Chandavarkar
1994: 411--20).

The MMS, known in English as the Textile Labour Association (this
name will be used below, abbreviated to TLA) was from the very
beginning a federation of craft-based unions. The different stages of the
production process resulted in the workers being divided into separate
occupational groups. Together, they all became members of the umbrella
union through membership of their specific association. It is interesting
to note that the initiative to set up the first union came from the jobbers/
foremen. They formed their association in 1919 as a direct consequence
of the prominent role they had played as frontmen of the strikes a year
previously. Although, in the early years of the modern textile industry,
they had functioned as a kind of shop-floor management, and as such
were more likely to act as strike breakers than as strike leaders, their room
for manoeuvre gradually eroded as the stability of the workforce in the
mills increased.[^/6/1] These middlemen responded to the loss, or the threat of
loss, of their power by distancing themselves from the management.
Their obedience to the employer or to the managerial staff could no
longer be taken for granted. The union leadership displayed political and
strategic insight by allowing the jobbers to defend their own specific
interests, thereby assuring continued control over their gangs. The large
mass of the workers followed the example of their foremen. By mid
1920, eight unions had been formed, one for each of the departments at
the centre of the production process: spinners, weavers, thrustle workers,
folders, sizers, winders, the card, blow and frame room workers, and,
lastly, the drivers, oilmen and firemen. Together they were all members
of the federation. When it was set up the TLA had a total of 16,450
members, almost 40% of the total workforce in the textile
industry.

[^/6/1]: For a detailed description of this development in the cotton mills in Bombay, see
Morris 1965: 142--53.


One aspect which must be emphasized is that the employers did not
oppose the setting up of the TLA but rather encouraged it, and even had
a strong influence on how it was organized. In early 1920, they were
concerned at the lightning strikes that were breaking out in Ahmedabad,
as in other industrial centres across the country, and were seeking ways of
dealing with the unrest. In his capacity as president of the employers'
association, Anasuyaben's brother Ambalal Sarabhai advised the AMA's
members to consent to the setting up of a trade union to create a
platform for negotiation. Disputes that could not be settled in this way
could then be submitted to a board of arbitration. After the AMA had
proposed a number of its members to sit on this board, it requested the
well-wishers of the nascent labour movement to set up unions for the
various occupations in the industry. And that is what happened
(Majmundar 1973: 82). However, a fierce debate developed among the
employers. Many of them came to the conclusion that, in the heat of the
moment, their president had made concessions all too hastily. They were
not interested in redressing the balance between capital and labour,
which not only meant higher wages but also a willingness to contribute
to the costs of housing and health care, and, who knows, eventually to
consider profit-sharing or employee participation in decision-making.
When the industrial agitation continued as the spinners went on strike,
the majority of the employers felt that this confirmed their worst fears.
Sarabhai resigned as president and even went as far as to withdraw his
own company from the AMA. Although his successor was more of a
hard-liner, he did not go back on the pledge to negotiate terms of
employment with the TLA. He did refuse, however, to honour the earlier
agreement that unsettled disputes should go to arbitration. Nevertheless,
the arbitration board was set up and Gandhi received the assurance that
he would be called upon to mediate in such cases. He subsequently
succeeded in reaching agreement on a considerable wage rise with the
new president of the AMA (Patel 1987: 46--51).

As already observed, Gandhi was very reluctant to promote the active
participation of the working class in the political process. When Maulana
Mohmedally, a popular Muslim leader in the Congress movement,
visited Ahmedabad in 1921, the mill workers were so enthusiastic that
they did not turn up for work for three days. Gandhi was very angry
about this breach of contract and expressed his displeasure in no uncertain
terms:

>'Hindu and Muslim workers have dishonoured and humiliated themselves by
abstaining from mills. Labour cannot discount me. I believe, no one in India can
do so. I am trying to free India from bondage and I refuse to be enslaved by
workers. With great difficulty I reconciled myself to your absence from mills
yesterday. But it is impossible for me to do so today. Nobility consists in your
compensating the mill owners with extra attendance equal to absence hours.'
The union man who recorded these words added that the workers accepted this
dressing down and penitently made up for the lost time: the emotional intoxication
of the workers disappeared immediately. They realised the seriousness of
their error and abided by the bidding of their leaders. ... And they worked extra
one hour daily for thirty days ... This incident provides an illustration of the
importance of discipline. (Banker 1965: 85).

The union's programme of activities, drawn up more for its members
than by them, placed great emphasis on their education as obedient
employees aware of their social responsibility in general and their duty
towards the employers in particular.

### A Revisionist Strategy

The great popularity of the new union was largely based on the way its
leaders had succeeded in their demands for better terms of employment.
The high percentage of membership was partly due to the efforts of the
employers to discourage workers from joining:

>If by chance the union of workers affiliated to the TLA was formed in any
department of the mill, they tried their utmost to break it with the help of the
powerful class of jobbers. Workers who joined the union were intimidated,
beaten and threatened with dismissal. Their leaders were victimised. (Majmundar
1973: 134)

This hardline approach had exactly the opposite effect and helped to
increase the legitimacy of the TLA among the rank and file. The
'righteous struggle', which had already booked its first success, was not
just about better pay. The employers were also forced to accept a shorter
working day, reduced from 12 to 10 hours, and were no longer permitted
to employ children under the age of 12. Much to their chagrin because
they considered the age of 10 quite acceptable as the cutting edge for
recruitment to mill work. Infected by the radicalization of the political
climate, as expressed by the Non-Cooperation Movement, the industrial
proletariat also became more militant. The high profits of the years
during and after the First World War resulted in the employers granting
the demand for a bonus in 1921. The pressure on them to introduce a
system of profit-sharing increased, with advocates proclaiming a right
that the workers should not be denied. Elsewhere in the country, largescale
capitalist industry was confronted with unions which represented
labour with more assertion and success than ever before. The drive
towards a renewal of the system of industrial relations came to an end in
1923, when there was a shortlived recession. After the recession, the leap
in production of the war years resumed. The number of companies kept
growing gradually and the expansion of the capacity in the spinning and
weaving shops meant that the size of the working population also
continued to rise. This trend would last until the end of the 1920s (see
table 2.1).

The 1923 recession led to a stockpiling. The employers took advantage
of the subsequent deterioration in profits to announce a wage cut of
20%. They justified this drastic measure by claiming that the cost
of living had also fallen. Their resolute stand was largely a result of the
restoration of unity in their ranks which had remained divided until
then. Their solid front enabled them to resist the general strike called by
the TLA in protest at the wage cut. When, after two months, the workers
were forced to return to work, they had been forced to agree to a 15% pay cut and the withdrawal of an earlier pledge to pay an annual
bonus. The defeat severely damaged the union's reputation. The most
visible and immediate consequence was a massive fall in membership,
from 25,000 in 1921 to 6,220 at the start of 1924 (Patel 1985: 60--2).[^/6/2]
In the period that followed, Gulzarilal Nanda and Khandubhai Desai
had to cycle around the industrial districts to try and persuade the lost
sheep to return to the fold.

The union learned its lesson from this debacle and decided to adopt
a new course in its efforts to promote the interests of its members. In
future, with a few exceptions, strikes were abandoned as a means of
improving the lot of the workers. This was not to say that the workers
themselves no longer resorted to this form of protest. In many of the
mills, they still downed tools on several occasions, 18 times in 1924 and
33 times in 1925. It is interesting to note that these short unauthorized
strikes were largely provoked by disputes between the management and
the jobbers (Lakha 1988: 109--11). The latter refused to accept their loss
of influence on the workfloor without some resistance and mobilized the
members of their gangs to ensure that their grievances were heard. The
TLA opposed these lightning strikes and warned workers against taking
part in them in the union's periodical.

>Lightning strikes often called out on petty issues involve mills as well as labour in
a big loss. They also create an ill-will between them. Since the betterment of
workers is dependent upon the prosperity of mills, workers should not impulsively
take steps that entail losses to the industry. We therefore cannot support a
strike called out without our prior consent. (Majmundar 1973: 152)

The wording reveals that the union leaders shared the employers' view
that the workers lacked the sense of responsibility and discipline required
to do their work properly. A joint investigation conducted in one mill by
the TLA secretary and the manager in response to complaints from
workers about pay cuts imposed as a result of breakdowns discovered
that the faults were indeed caused by intentional carelessness and not by
technical problems in the production process. The spinners' union was
thus compelled to condemn the conduct of the workers who had
submitted the complaints --- which may have been a case of the weak
resorting to industrial sabotage, one of the few weapons in their arsenal
of resistance-- in a resolution (Majmundar 1973: 152). In this light it is
not surprising that the TLA refused to speak out against the custom of
mill management to impose fines on workers who showed a lack of
discipline. In his annual speech in 1924, the chairman/president of the
AMA expressed his satisfaction that the labour leaders in the city understood
the objective of organizing the workers, to increase productivity:

[^/6/2]: According to other sources, membership fell even more drastically, plummeting to
only 1,500 after the strike. (Kamath and Kher 1993: 251)


>Gentlemen, we should not commit the error of always taking all labour organizations
as inimical to our interests because our interests as well as theirs have but
one ultimate aim, namely efficient production ... They have to evolve order out
of chaos and deal with rough illiterate masses. (quoted in Lakha 1988: 111--2)

### Taming the Workforce

The TLA's new strategy avoided confrontation with the employers and
gave priority to improving the quality of life in the residential areas.
Gandhi's assistants had established a clear picture of the misery endured
by the workers during their tour of the mill neighbourhoods at the time
of the strike in 1918. Like Anasuyaben before them, they were deeply
impressed by the need to drastically improve the living conditions of the
average mill worker and his family. In the official view the dire poverty
was the result of all kinds of bad habits, such as alcohol abuse, gambling,
an obstinate tendency to spend more than they earned, a severe lack of
hygiene in regard to themselves and their homes, and a general intemperance
and lack of sobriety. These defects in their behaviour extended to
relations between men and women and a neglect on the part of adults to
give the next generation a solid and decent upbringing. To bring about a
change in this state of immorality at the base of society was a civilizing
mission in which those fighting for national freedom as well as reformers
of religious persuasion met each other in Gandhi's campaign for social
upliftment. The TLA grew to become a platform for this moral crusade.
The annals of the union are full of lamentations about the shameful
defects in the quality of the industrial workforce.

>They are not as a rule armed with sufficient intelligence and moral development
to resist the degrading influences which surround them on all sides in a city like
this. So many of them sink in one way or the other. A large number of them lose
their moral balance and become slaves to liquor habits, many go down as
physical wrecks and waste away from tuberculosis. (Annual Report of the Textile
Labour Union 1925)

We now know that the workers were physical wrecks not only because
of the poverty --- for which, in the eyes of those who wanted to improve
their situation, they had only themselves to blame --- but as a result of the
relentless pace
of work and occupational afflictions such as lung diseases
they developed during their work at the mills. Lakha, who took the
above quotation from the TLA's 1925 annual report, adds that the report
suggested that the situation in which the workers found themselves was
due to the great distance between their inferior moral fibre and 'all high
and stimulating influences', to which the better-off social classes were
accustomed (Lakha 1988: 126).

The project to improve the lot of the workers was undertaken on a
broad front. The importance attached to that endeavour can be seen
from the fact that the TLA devoted 70% of its budget in 1925 to
social care and welfare schemes. Surprisingly, given the bad quality of
housing, improving the living conditions of the workers was not seen as
a priority. No effort was made to promote public housing through the
foundation of working-class cooperatives. The workers remained dependent
on the _chawls_ built around the mills and rented out by the mill
owners or by private landlords on a commercial basis. Both the inadequacy
of the accommodation provided and the lack of even the most
basic facilities such as drinking water and sewage meant that housing
was one of the biggest obstacles to efforts to improve the workers' living
standards. In 1930, the Royal Commission on Labour issued a strong
criticism of the industrial districts in Ahmedabad, which:

> ... present pictures of terrible squalor. Nearly 92% of the houses are oneroomed;
they are badly built, insanitary, ill-ventilated and over-crowded, while
water supplies are altogether inadequate and latrine accommodation is almost
entirely wanting. (quoted in Majmundar 1973: 150)

The steady growth of the population of Ahmedabad led to the
expansion of all kinds of administrative and management tasks, which
demanded strengthening of the municipal apparatus. Until the early
1930s, two-thirds of the city had no drainage system. This situation
gradually improved in the years that followed, but first and foremost in
the new townships that emerged on the right side of the river where
members of the intermediate and higher castes chose to live in their own
housing societies. The industrial districts on the left bank came last in
line, if at all, for land-levelling, road paving, refuse collection, or
streetlighting. The opening of the first bus line in 1920 made the centre
more accessible by public transport and helped break the severe isolation
in which the mill workers had lived until then.

The close contacts that had developed between the union and the
Congress movement were instrumental in mitigating the neglect and
deprivation of the industrial working class of the city. The leaders of the
TLA, themselves from a bourgeois milieu, acted as the spokesmen for
their rank and file in the political arena. The fight for national independence
had created a new social fervour, in which the demand for selfdetermination
could not be seen in isolation from at least formal
recognition in politics of the presence of a mass of people who, until
then, had never taken part in public decision-making. In 1924, the first
mill worker was elected to the city council, as a member of Congress. The
union leadership took the initiative to nominate the man, a spinner from
an untouchable caste, as candidate and carefully coached him in the
election campaign. In 1937, a quarter of the members of the city council
were members of the TLA. Only a few were workers, the large majority
being highor low-ranking union officials. This growth in the representation
of labour --- which had expanded further to 17 by the end of the
1940s --- helped to alert the urban bureaucracy to the needs and wishes of
districts which had long been discriminated against in the allocation of
municipal funds. As for the inhabitants of the industrial districts, they
had become more assertive in expressing their demands.

>With Kacharabhai in the Municipality it became easy to take up the work of
providing the necessary facilities in the workers' neighbourhoods. The attention
of both the Congress party and the municipal officers was called to the various
needs for roads, lights, water, toilets, and other facilities, and efforts were made
to provide whatever improvements were possible ... The workers had been
unaware of the responsibilities and the work of the Municipality and they had
suffered from feelings of inferiority. At first when the TLA came to the workers
to talk to them about their lack of sensitivity to their own basic needs, the
workers said: 'Yes, it may be like that, but we have no complaints.' A welcome
change began to occur in that attitude.' (quoted in Spodek 2002: 217)

To deduce from this that direct access to municipal decision-making
put a stop to the longstanding deprivation of the working-class districts
would be too optimistic an assessment. In 1927, when floods created
serious damage in Ahmedabad, Vallabhbhai Patel, the Congress leader of
the city council, flatly refused to allow the industrial neighbourhoods an
equal share of the official emergency aid. Gandhi himself had to intervene
to ensure that these parts of the city, which were the worst hit,
received at least a proportionate share of the relief funds. But even he was
only moderately successful. His lieutenant Vallabhbhai Patel insisted
that the workers should appeal to their employers for compensation.
This was the stock answer of the local authorities to the repeated appeals,
year in and year out, to improve public housing in the industrial districts.
The deplorable state of the large majority of tenements in the mill
localities is evident from a shocked report by the President of Ahmedabad
Municipality after a visit to a _chawl_ built by a private slumlord for rent.

>I saw a _chawl_ built by a wealthy gentleman. It was built without a finished plinth
foundation, and the floor of the room was about one and a half feet lower than
the surrounding ground level, allowing water and other materials to drain into it.
The structure was built not of baked bricks but of strips of iron. The strips were
not fastened with metal nails, but were stood up and held in place by wooden
rafters. There was not enough space in this room for a five and one-half foot man
to stand erect, nor could he stretch out full length to sleep. The rent (at that time)
was Rs. 3/month. The _chawl_ had no special facility for water. There were so few
toilets, and the ones that existed were so dirty, that if you wanted to give a
description of hell you need not go further. I was so overwhelmed with
disgust, that the words blurted out of my mouth, 'Oh God, how can it be that
the wealthy man who profits by keeping poor people in this hell is not punished
for this sin?' (Mavlankar and Dalal, quoted in Spodek, manuscript, chapter 4:37)

The TLA had already reported in 1930 that the housing for the mill
workers was grossly inadequate. To improve this situation, Gulzarilal
Nanda, the leading TLA member in the city council, submitted a plan
for the building of 500 working-class tenements at a cost of 400--500
rupees each. The employers' association opposed this scheme and promised
the council that it would build twice as many workers' homes itself.
To fulfil this pledge, the employers set up the Ahmedabad Mill Housing
Society and provided it with moderate seed capital. The initiative achieved
a little, but fell far short of its stated objective.

### Union Activities on the Workfloor and in the Neighbourhood

The direct intervention of the union to improve the welfare of its
members first took the form of badly needed health care provisions. In
1921, child mortality was as high as 360 per 1,000 in the industrial
districts, compared to 50 per 1,000 among the population of Ahmedabad
as a whole. The health of the people in the industrial neighbourhoods
was also much worse than in the city at large. The opening of the first
two primary health centres for consultation and the provision of medicines
for the workers and their families offered what the mills had failed
to provide: the treatment of sickness and other medical problems.
Paramedical supervision was provided for pregnant women and young
mothers to bring down the child mortality rate and there was a maternity
hospital with 20 beds. Women were instructed in personal hygiene and
how to keep their homes clean, the preparation and use of healthy food
(avoiding meat and alcohol), how to organize their households and,
more generally, how to live a life of moderation and piety. The practical
impossibility of following this advice was occasionally made abundantly
clear. For example, in 1930, M.M. Malaviya, Vice Chancellor of Benaras
Hindu University visited Ahmedabad to raise funds for his academic
institution among the textile barons. During his visit he made a quick
tour of the industrial districts.

>When he told a meeting of workers that they ought to bathe every day, he was
met by laughter. He asked, 'Why are you laughing?' They said, 'We don't have
enough water for drinking. How can we arrange for baths!' The next day
Malaviya went into the workers' _chawls_ to see for himself. He saw a line of
women carrying pots to fill with water from a single tap. (Spodek 2002: 219)

Encouraging education was also high on the agenda. In 1924, nine day
schools for children and 11 evening schools for adults were opened, with
a total of 1,200 registered pupils. The same year saw the publication of
the first issue of _Majoor Sandesh_. This union weekly was produced on the
TLA's own printing press and had a circulation of 5,000. The paper,
which is still being published, albeit irregularly kept the workers up to
date on the union's aims, working methods, programmes, and results.
For its educational activities, which also included the opening of
neighbourhood reading rooms, the union received an annual contribution
from the employers. Not all of them, however, were in favour of this
form of support. One is recorded as having expressed the fear that
schooling would reduce the workers' interest in working at the mills
(quoted in Masihi 1985: 16). Despite all these efforts, a TLA survey of
3,926 workers' families conducted in 1930 concluded that less than 21% had any literate members. A cooperative savings society where
members could acquire low-interest loans was set up to combat the high
level of indebtedness to private moneylenders. In 1947 this went a step
further, when the union set up its own bank, the only one of its kind in
the whole country.

A shorter working day meant that, for the first time, the workers were
able to do other things than just work to provide their daily necessities.
The union instructed them in how they could spend their hours of
leisure in useful pursuits rather than surrendering to the temptation to
fritter it away by gambling, drinking, or simply doing nothing. Gandhi
and the senior leaders of the union believed that the misery of the
workers' living conditions was the result not so much of exploitation and
oppression as of the inferior quality of the masses at the base of society,
from which most of the union's members came. They could only hope
for a better future if they were prepared to mend their ways. According
to this line of thought the majority of the simple but as yet uncorrupted
men and women who had left the countryside had soon fallen prey to a
profligate and licentious way of life once they arrived in the city. The
extra income from their work in the mills provided the funds to pay for
it. Gandhi exhorted the workers to spend the extra pay that they
managed to wrest from the employers wisely:

>Whenever I broach the topic of increase in wages and good reward for you, the
millowners tell me: 'What will you do by asking for an increase? Will the workers
utilise the extra cash for a nutritious diet? For good clothes? Will they educate
their children or will they spend it on liquor?' When I hear this, I bow my head
in shame. You must save me from such adverse comments and you can do that
only by giving up consumption of liquor. (Kamath and Kher 1993: 224)

Increasing the worker's knowledge was high on the union's agenda.
Encouraging men to read was an important means of putting an end to
their ignorance and their alleged lack of civic responsibility. The wives
and daughters of mill workers learned to operate sewing machines so
they could make and mend clothes for their families. Advocating piety,
virtue, and sobriety was founded on the significance Gandhi gave to
instilling into the working classes a higher moral standard than that to
which they were accustomed. In 1928, the TLA announced the foundation
of a social reform movement (_Samaj Sudarna Sangh_) which called for
total abstinence from alcohol and tobacco as well as meat and for other
forms of self-discipline. The group singing of religious songs (_bhajan
mandli_) in small informal gatherings became a popular pastime in the
industrial districts. In addition to purifying their souls, the workers were
also encouraged to take better care of their bodies and, the young in
particular, to take part in sporting activities. The dozens of wrestling
clubs (_akhadas_) which sprang up attracted participants and spectators
from a wide range of castes.

Clearly, this social work also led to greater interaction and awareness
among the working population. Outside the workplace, many meeting
places grew up where, more than in the mills themselves, people from
different backgrounds came together for educational or recreational
purposes. This social part of the union's programme was important in
itself, but also greatly increased the capacity of the workers to act
collectively and to participate in clubs and associations, either as active or
passive members. The following quotation by one of the leaders of the
Gandhian union is indicative of the far-reaching ambitions which inspired
the union in its efforts to improve the lot and lives of its rank and
file, as well as the arrogance with which this was pursued:

>TLA looks after sixteen hours of the worker's life and his children's problems too.
Without fuss and without show, _Mahajan_ workers (note: this means the fulltime
officials) look after everything concerning the workers. (Barot 1997: 44)

Given the considerable importance attached to all kinds of social reforms,
it is remarkable that there was no room on the union's agenda for
any measures aimed at breaking the traditional caste system. The total
failure to address the rigid hierarchical order was of course due to the fact
that Gandhian teaching accepted caste and all it stood for as a focal unit
in the structuring of society. Instead of rejection, therefore, the emphasis
was on curbing the excesses of the caste regime. The main thrust was to
combat intolerable practices of untouchability in particular. Efforts to
this end were, however, feeble and the results meagre. The division of
labour in the mills along lines of caste and religion was not questioned,
while the communal pattern of housing was also sustained, with members
of the untouchable caste segregated in separate residential blocks.
Union leaders claimed that the earlier practice in the mill canteens for
members of different castes not to eat the same food or drink the same
water had been given up, but aged workers whom I interviewed denied
this. One of them recalled the situation in the following words:

>_Dalits_ could not enter hotels for a cup of tea, but they were forced to sit outside
and have the cup of tea and wash it up after use. Even in the mill canteen they
were made to sit outside while upper caste workers sat inside the canteen. The
throstle department was created for the untouchables. There were separate
drinking water tanks and resting places for upper castes and _Dalits_. Untouchability
was rampant, though all were workers of the mills but upper caste
considered themselves as higher up. The workers had no unity on social grounds.
The feeling that all the workers were the victims of exploitation could not be
generated due to this casteism (Parmar 1989: 9).

The weak support given to those who supported the emancipation of the
untouchables by the TLA's leaders must be seen in the light of the
resistance to such a radical policy in mainstream urban society. The
rejection of caste reforms was shared by the members of the union who
did not themselves belong to the ranks of the _Harijans_. In the eyes of
critics, the refusal to actively campaign for equality was a blemish on the
mission that had been presented as the 'righteous struggle'. Muslim
weavers showed their lack of faith in the union's economic and social
programme in much more radical fashion and many of them refused to
join. The Royal Commission on Labour in India considered this rejection
significant enough to draw attention to it in its 1931 report (RCIL,
vol. 1, 1931: 337). As we have seen, the division along caste lines was
also institutionalized in the structure of the union itself. This was a
logical consequence of acceptance of the link between occupation and
social identity on the work floor as a _fait accompli_.

The broadly formulated objective of the union included the struggle
to improve the abominable conditions under which work in the mill had
to be carried out. Pressure on the employers to introduce measures to
prevent or at least reduce health risks was increased. The factory halls
were seriously polluted by dust and filth, which gave rise to lung diseases
and digestive disorders among the machine operators, especially those
involved in the early stages of production. There was a dire need for
ventilation, as also to provide relief from the relentless heat and the high
humidity. The need to give serious attention to complaints about these
working conditions came to light when a government inspector reported
his visit to five mills in Ahmedabad in 1923.

>Hard physical work under present conditions ... is an absolute impossibility.
Even standing still and wearing the very lightest clothing, one becomes saturated
with perspiration almost immediately. And though workers may become
acclimatised to these conditions to some extent, the time which they waste in the
mill compound and their generally distressed and listless appearance afford
convincing proof that years of usage do not make them entirely immune ... This
points to the necessity for adopting all practical measures for reducing temperatures
to a minimum; but except in isolated instances very little is attempted in
this direction. (Majmundar 1973: 149)

To lighten the burden for female employees, a law was introduced in
1922 forbidding them to work after seven o'clock in the evening and
before 5.30 in the morning, while many mills offered young mothers the
possibility of leaving their babies (but not toddlers) in crèches. As with
the installation of latrines and the ample provision of safe drinking water,
these facilities were insisted upon as much with a view to increasing the
dignity of labour as from a concern for the workers' health. For the same
reason the employers were pressurized to open canteens and to permit the
work to be interrupted by short but regular breaks.

The TLA had not opposed the custom of disciplining employees by
cutting their wages for 'unnecessary' absenteeism, carelessness, or not
doing their work properly. But gradually, efforts were made to restrict the
freedom of the management and the owners, regarding both the severity
of the fines and the arbitrary nature of sanctions for offences that had
nothing to do with work performance. According to a report in _Majoor
Sandesh_ in 1925, such deductions could amount to as much as 15% of the monthly wage (Majmundar 1973: 150). The steady expansion
of legal protection kept pace with the progressive standardization of
terms of employment in all the mills. This development marked the start
of what would grow to become one of the most successful features of the
union programme: the right of members to submit a complaint if they
had suffered an injustice. The substantial staff of the TLA responsible for
investigating the grievances would take up cases with the management of
the mill concerned.

>Every department in a mill unionised by the TLA was given a complaint book
and workers were encouraged to record their complaints. A variety of issues came
to light, such as exploitation by jobbers, arbitrary decreases in wages, fines,
bribery and blackmail, unsatisfactory work conditions, humidification, noise,
poor lighting and sanitation. The union organised its activities around these
complaints in the later part of this period. The complaint book provided detailed
information on working conditions, as well as the bondage exercised by the
jobber on the workers. Many complaints were recorded against jobbers who
imposed fines on workers for the alleged production of sub-standard cloth. This
system put the worker in the jobber's power, for to curtail fines bribery was the
workers' only recourse. (Patel 1987: 83)

The changing role of the jobbers/foremen was discussed at the end of
the first chapter. A part of the literature on the dynamics of the industrialization
process suggests that these middlemen lost power as the employers
adopted a new strategy based on more stable labour relations. In
this view, the employers themselves kept a tighter grip on the expansion
and renewal of the labour force and no longer left recruitment to
shopfloor bosses who were more interested in protecting their own
interests. But the jobbers' position also came under pressure as the union
acquired a direct link with its members, both in and outside the mills.
One aspect that receives insufficient attention in these opposing views is
that both parties --- employers and union leaders --- continued to use the
jobbers to pursue their own objectives, the first to resist any authority of
the TLA over the state of affairs inside the mills as long as possible.

>If by chance the union of workers affiliated to the TLA was formed in any
department of the mill, they (note: the management) tried their utmost to break
it with the help of the powerful class of jobbers. Workers who joined the union
were intimidated, beaten and threatened with dismissal. Their leaders were
victimised. (Kamath and Kher 1993: 134)

For their part, recognizing the privileged position they held in the mill
hierarchy, the union tried to get the jobbers on their side. By steering a
middle course between these two conflicting strategies, the jobbers by
and large succeeded in preserving the freedom of manoeuvre they had
acquired over the course of time. They failed to prevent the TLA from
nominating its own representatives in the mills, who maintained direct
contact with the union office. Yet they tried to exercise their influence in
the elections that took place to appoint these _pratinidhis_, who functioned
as shop stewards (Majmundar 1973: 145).

The industrial peace that lasted throughout much of the 1920s was
broken by a number of incidents in various mills. Often it took the form
of a protest by workers either in favour of or against a _mukadam_. In the
first instance when a jobber was sacked and not reinstated, in the second
when the members of a gang mutinied against the random and discriminatory
nature of the exercise of power by their boss. In 1928, for
example, a jobber summoned two workers who had not obeyed his
orders.

>They were then shut in a room and beaten, a practice common in those days. At
the instigation of some officials the faces of the two workers were then blackened
by the jobber. To make matters worse their hands were tied behind their backs
and were then paraded within the mills premises. Veera Sava was an old, godfearing
man with an impeccable reputation and he took the insult very seriously;
when he returned to his _chawl_ he tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose
of opium and had to be rushed to hospital where the doctors saved him. (Kamath
and Kher 1993: 268)

The fact that the victim was so shamed that he had wanted to end his
life indicated how the times had changed. Thanks to the emergence of a
countervailing power it was now possible to call bosses, both lower and
higher, to order. Not always, but sometimes and to some extent. Their
unlimited and discretionary power to act came to an end. In this case, the
union claimed that the employer was liable and succeeded in ensuring
that the jobber was given a stiff fine.

### More For, Than By the Workers

In the second half of the 1920s, the TLA slowly managed to make up the
fall in membership and influence that had followed the failed strike in 1923. By the end of 1928 the union had more than 17,000 members,
approximately a third of the entire workforce of the mills. Although this
fell well short of the over 50% in the period following the setting
up of the TLA, the upward trend was an encouraging sign. Without
putting the trust of the rank and file unduly to the test, the change of
course from confrontation to collaboration had contributed strongly to
the legitimacy of the union's work in the eyes of the employers. I have
pointed out earlier that, in representing the interests of its members, the
TLA's strategy was founded on what the Gandhian leadership saw as a
sense of social responsibility. Both the demands submitted to the employers
and the welfare work undertaken in the industrial districts
testified to reservations regarding the willingness of its members to lead
a life of moderation and diligence. The union weekly again and again
urged the workers to behave as good employees, in other words to follow
the orders of the management closely, perform their tasks with dedication,
and to avoid active protest, even if they were unable to make their
justifiable collective or individual demands heard immediately and in
full. The appeal to behave reasonably also extended of course to acceptance
of the TLA's goals and its chosen course. The employers were duly
satisfied with this constructive ideology. The colonial administration
also agreed with it, albeit with a slightly critical undertone. The final
report of the Royal Commission on Labour in India summarized its
opinion of the Gandhian variant of organized labour in Ahmedabad by
stating that 'the union is managed more for than by the workers' (RCIL,
vol. I: 337).

The bond that was forged between the employers and employees in
the Manchester of India had much to do with the Congress movement's
desire to bridge the differences between both parties in a strategy aimed
at bringing the struggle for independence to a successful end and in a
way that tried to do justice to the interests of domestic labour and
capital. The employers could no longer afford to flatly ignore reasonable
demands from the organized workers without jeopardizing the mills'
position on the domestic market (Patel 1987: 93--4). Against this
background the proponents of nationalistic policies managed to reconcile
economic actors who represented the model of the new industrial
society in the post-colonial age. But objections by one or both the parties
remained an obstacle to an overly close relationship. Employers objected,
for example, to an agreement under which they had to not only
solemnly promise not to discourage recruitment drives by the union, but
to also deduct membership contributions from workers' wages. It was
necessary for Gandhi to intervene to persuade the AMA to ratify this
agreement (Majmundar 1973: 92; Kamath and Kher 1993: 255).

The textile industry was experiencing its golden years. As the number
of mills increased further and the capacity of the spinning and weaving
shops expanded, more workers were taken on (see tables 2.1 and 2.2). In
1932 the city's population stood at 382,768. The industrial peace that
reigned during the latter half of the 1920s was interrupted only occasionally
by small skirmishes restricted to one or a few mills. One such
case has already been discussed. The humiliating punishment of two
workers by their jobber for an alleged offence led to a strike. During an
earlier conflict in the same mill, provoked by the sudden sacking of a
number of workers who had joined the TLA, the management had
decided to close the _chawl_ in which the workers lived and the inhabitants
were prohibited from meeting each other in the evenings. Security
guards monitored compliance with this restriction on their freedom of
movement. The intention was to prevent union officials from visiting
the neighbourhood at the end of the day and talking with the strikers
beyond the reach of the mill bosses. The ensuing conflict gave the
management the opportunity to order the employees to vacate their
houses, which were owned by the mills (Kamath and Kher 1993: 268--9). Cases such as these illustrate the great difficulty which the TLA had
in restricting the power of the employers over labour and in achieving
recognition for their role as representative of its members' interests. But
this opposition could do nothing but strengthen the legitimacy of the
union in the eyes of the working people.

In 1929, encouraged by the high profits enjoyed by the mills in the
second half of the 1920s, the union tabled a new demand during the
periodic negotiations with the AMA: the right of labour to a family wage
that was sufficient to cover the cost of living, in more than just the sense
of survival. The demand was accompanied by family budget statistics
provided by the Labour Bureau, which were intended to bolster the just
nature of the desired improvement. After the AMA had flatly and
resolutely rejected the demand, Gandhi and the association's representative
held direct talks. The latter initially wanted to link the wage level to
the state of the industry. Gandhi insisted that an employer was obliged to
pay his workers at least a living wage right up to the moment that it was
necessary for him to use his reserves for the company to remain in
business. When these talks also came to nothing, the dispute was
submitted to an independent assessor, according to the agreed arbitration
procedures described earlier. His decision in favour of the workers
was not based on Gandhi's arguments but on the substantial profits
enjoyed by the industry in the preceding years. In addition, there was no
question of the purchasing power of the working-class families restoring
to its pre-1923 level. The 1923 pay cut was almost double the amount of
the increase now granted. The union leadership celebrated this small
success as a great victory. By the start of 1930, the membership of the
TLA had risen even further, to almost 22,000. Trapped within the
confines of Congress policies, which gave priority to the domestic textile
industry, the manufacturers were forced this time to accept the settlement.

### Economic Recession

The economic recession of the early 1930s also made itself felt in the
textile industry in Ahmedabad. The fall in incomes across the board
resulted in a shrinking of demand for cotton and clothing. In addition,
imports from Great Britain and, more than ever, from Japan, where the
dramatic devaluation of the yen had given Asian markets a strong boost,
led to deterioration of the competitive position of Indian industry.
Because production was not immediately reduced, unsold stocks expanded
rapidly and a large number of companies found themselves with
a cash-flow problem. Those who had operated with a system of two 12hour
shifts during the profitable years, now shut down production in the
early evening until the following morning. In the second half of the
decade, the economy began to recover, but industrial capacity would not
return to its former level until 1939. The recession had, of course, a
significant impact on the working population, a mass that had doubled
in size between 1918 and 1930.

The crisis reached its height in 1933. Mills closing or operating at less
than full capacity --- even if this was only temporary --- led to the instant
dismissal of all or a part of the workforce. A survey conducted at the end
of the year revealed that more than half of the weavers and a quarter of
the spinners had lost their jobs (Patel 1987: 119). One indication of the
increased power of the union in the years preceding the crisis was that
some mill owners did their best to avoid dismissing TLA members.
However, they, neglected to consult the union leadership before introducing
a whole range of cutbacks. Their standpoint was that this would
constitute external interference in their management policy. They refused
to even consider such a violation of the entrepreneur's prerogative,
which of course ran counter to Gandhi's idea of a close partnership. The
employers did submit a proposal to the union for a 25% wage cut
across the board. The AMA defended the measure by referring to the
losses suffered by the industry and arguing that the cost of living had also
fallen. The TLA responded by insisting on the right of its members to
earn a minimum subsistence wage adequate for their family's livelihood.
The employers indignantly rejected this demand. Indicative of the
rapidly deteriorating relationship was an AMA resolution circulated
among its members that they should no longer feel bound by the
agreement to deduct union subscriptions directly from the workers'
wages.

It proved possible, however, to avoid a complete break. Firstly because
the TLA, as always, was prepared to reach a compromise. But also
because the employers realized that further erosion of the union's power
would invoke an even greater threat --- that it would no longer be possible
to settle the unrest among the vanguard of the working masses by
Gandhian means. The dispute went to arbitration, and the result was a
considerably lower wage cut than had earlier been proposed. Nevertheless,
the cut, set at 6.5% at the start of 1935--- 'one anna in a rupee
in the earnings of all the time and piece workers including those paid on
a monthly basis' (Majmundar 1973: 101) --- did neutralize the moderate
increase that had been achieved in 1929. During the negotiations on the
settlement, the union also had to agree to rationalization of the operations
in the mills to increase productivity in a way that was detrimental
to total employment. Under the agreement, men who had been taken on
in the past year and the wives of men who had (and would keep) a job in
the textile industry would be made redundant. After the first round of
expulsions of women at the end of the nineteenth century, men were
once again given priority as the natural candidates for jobs in the formal
economy. Jobbers took advantage of this agreement to bring the union
into disrepute:

>They started telling women workers that the TLA had resolved to drive out all of
them from mills and they could retain their jobs only if they oiled their palms.
This trick worked very well on women workers most of whom were illiterate and
ignorant. In a false propaganda like this apart from minting money the motive of
the jobbers was to discredit the TLA to the utmost in the eyes of workers. For
they knew it well that with the TLA gaining strength their power and privileges
vis-à-vis workers were bound to diminish greatly if not totally. (Majmundar
1973: 145)

The reduction in capacity and the terms of employment made it clear
that the employers had got their way. The disruption of industrial peace
created opportunities for more radical and militant initiatives to push
the workers in a different direction than that of the TLA. This temptation
was nourished by the insistence of the employers that the permitted
pay cut was not enough to bring profits back to a reasonable level. In
1936, the AMA announced plans for a further cutback of 20% on
labour costs. They abandoned this proposal not so much because of
Gandhi's stubborn resistance --- for him any measure was unacceptable
that violated the right to a minimum wage --- but because of a wave of
lightning strikes. The unrest threatened to disrupt the entire structure of
industrial relations.

### Defusing the Radical Threat

In 1933, communist activists who had maintained close contacts for
many years with the much more radical labour movement in Bombay set
up
the Mill Majdoor Mandal (MMM). The weavers showed the greatest
interest in this new initiative. Many of the weavers were Muslims, who
not only had little affinity with the Hindu morals that inspired the
leaders of the Gandhian union, but also felt that the interests of the less
skilled and lower paid spinners were being better represented than their
own. The system of payment for weavers was still largely based on
individual performance. Their income varied depending on the amount
of material they produced, but this was accompanied by a whole range of
deductions imposed by the bosses for allegedly producing cloth of
insufficient quality or quantity. The problem was that the productivity
norm was not set on the basis of objective criteria. Foremen in particular,
but also senior managers, abused their positions. Weavers who produced
flawed fabric were not only paid a reduced rate but also ran the risk of
being fined. They could avoid punishment (or the threat of it) by paying
their superiors occasional or sometimes regular bribes. This informal
procedure fell outside the influence of the TLA, but the anger among the
workers about such arbitrary and corrupt practices had only become
more intense. In 1935, the new union used these grievances to call two
strikes in a number of mills. In one case it led to the dismissal of a jobber
who had been accused of abusing his position. In the second, the TLA
succeeded, after promising to investigate the complaint thoroughly and
to find a solution, in persuading the strikers to return to work and to give
up their membership of the Mill Majdoor Mandal. The newly set up
radical union had already been declared illegal by the colonial administration
in 1934. The arrest of six of its leaders had prevented the further
recruitment of members among the industrial vanguard of the working
class of Ahmedabad. The union's staff continued its activities underground
under the new name of Lal Vavta (Red Flag). _Sardar_ Vallabhbhai
Patel was one of a number of Congress leaders who came to the aid of the
TLA. In a speech to a drummed up crowd of members he preached
against breaking the alliance that had been forged with the employers in
his city.

> ... there is friendship, fellowship, cleanliness and family feeling between mill
owners and workers. If these relationships break down, then the vacuum created
will only be filled with halahal, and the atmosphere will be poisonous and
demonical. (Kamath and Kher 1993: 295)

Yet this strategy was unable to neutralize all the competition once and for
all. A greater threat than the communist union was the left-wing of the
Congress movement. These radicalized rebels had become increasingly
disillusioned with Gandhi's ideas, and especially the way they were
applied in industrial relations. Even within the TLA, there were staff
members who felt sympathy with those who spoke of the imperfect
mobilization' of the working class.[^/6/3] The Congress Socialist Party, which
was present as a lobby group in the mother organization from the mid
1930s, advocated expanding the struggle against imperialism to include
the mass of the working population. As an extension of this, the group
also called for increased pressure to be applied to bring about farreaching
changes in the domestic social order. The political activists in
Ahmedabad who gathered under this banner had very varied backgrounds.
Some, like Dinkar Mehta, had studied at the Gandhian Gujarat
Vidyapeeth and had won their spurs in the 1930 Civil Disobedience
Movement. Among the leaders of the CSP were two _Harijans_, including
Kachara Bhagat, who had been the first _Harijan_ member of the city
council, on behalf of the TLA. It was this motley crew who took the
opportunity, a year after the ban on the MMM, to set up the Mill
Kamdar Union (MKU). They were encouraged to take this initiative
when workers rallied to their call to strike _en masse_ in protest at the
acceptance by the TLA of the 1935 pay cut. The activists succeeded in
prolonging the strike, involving 22,500 employees in 32 mills, for two
weeks. The Gandhian leaders reported that they had completely lost
their grip on the workers. To regain control of the situation, the government
was forced to call in the police, who used very violent tactics, and
to ban demonstrations and meetings as a form of illegal assembly (Lakha
1988: 115). Although the demand for wages to be raised to the former
level was unsuccessful the protest showed that there was potential to
mobilize labour in a more militant front against the employers. The
programme of demands was more radical, but what really helped to
make the leaders of the new union popular was that they avoided an
authoritarian/paternalistic style in their dealings with the rank and file.
As Dinkar Mehta succinctly put it in retrospect, they were addressed in
the language of solidarity rather than of hierarchy. 'We had become not
the uplifters of the workers but their companions, friends and comrades.'
(Mehta 1968: 150--1)

[^/6/3]: This term is borrowed from the subtitle which Pandey gave to his study on the
emergence of the Congress movement in Uttar Pradesh after the first quarter of the
twentieth century (Pandey 1978).

The TLA had every reason to be concerned and adopted a two-track
strategy to prevent further erosion of its established position. Through
_Sardar_ Patel, the leaders called on Gandhi and Nehru to help stem the
rapidly growing resistance to its primacy in the realm of organized
labour, both overtly and covertly. First, they had to wipe out the
troublesome opposition within their own ranks. The TLA wished to be
free of allegations such as those levelled by the Gujarat Congress District
Committee that the result of the negotiations with the AMA in 1935
signified surrender to capitalist interests and a shameful betrayal of the
working class. To support this claim, the socialist and communist
activists referred to the rationalization measures included in the agreement
after considerable pressure had been applied by the employers.
They amounted to a doubling of the workload for the spinners --- the
result of the women being expelled from the mills --- in exchange for a
wage rise of less than half. The spinners went on strike to achieve a return
to the original situation, but the protest was shortlived after premature
and hardhanded intervention by the police. _Sardar_ Patel, who could
count on greater loyalty from the employers than Gandhi, urged them to
adopt a more accommodating attitude towards the TLA. Alluding to the
possibility of left-wing agitation imported from abroad, the Governor of
Bombay called on the captains of industry in Ahmedabad to adopt a
united front but, at the same time, not to reject out of hand any
reasonable demands.

>Your recent troubles have shown that your organization is not comprehensive
nor completely effective. It seems to me essential that you should bring in all the
employers and improve the discipline of your members so that the reasoned
agreements of the majority should not be upset by the refusal of the few to
cooperate. It is also essential that you should look with an impartial eye on the
grievances of labour. The recent strikes have shown that there are active agencies
abroad which will seize on every real grievance to foment trouble and to increase
their own power for bringing about strikes ... you know better than anyone what
rates of wages the industry will stand. ... within those limits remove all
grievances which you know to be genuine. (quoted in Majmundar 1973: 164)

To prevent the desertion of its members to more radical organizations,
the Gandhian union started a propaganda campaign in the industrial
districts. Pamphlets were distributed on a large scale explaining the
advantages of the new agreement and pointing out to a still unenthusiastic
rank and file the wide range of welfare activities it encompassed in
education, health care, and housing. Neighbourhood committees in
many _mohallas_ and _chawls_ were instructed to keep a close eye on the
activities of their residents, to disseminate information as frontline
agents of the union's headquarters, and to report incidents of undesirable
agitation. The TLA leaders, who had reluctantly agreed in 1936 to the
employers' decision to stop deducting union subscriptions from workers'
wages, admitted now that the collection of the money by the _pratinidhis_
(shop stewards) had made them much more accommodating when it
came to complaints from members on the shopfloor. In the new way of
thinking, this meant that the union's officials learned to be more receptive
to the needs and wishes of the rank and file. None of these efforts
were successful in arresting or reversing the fall in membership of the
union. Even more resolute attempts than before to break the power of
the jobbers in the mills were equally unsuccessful. But the union could
not afford to restrict its activities within the confines of the mills. The
following chapter examines the prominent role of the TLA in the
formulation of labour policy at the national level.
