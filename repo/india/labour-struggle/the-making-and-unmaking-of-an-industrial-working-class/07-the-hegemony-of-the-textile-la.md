## The Hegemony of the Textile Labour Association

### The Fight over Representation

The fact that the TLA was no match for the power of the owners and
management of the mills was made obvious in a ruthless and, for
insiders, totally unexpected manner. Aware of the union's weakness, the
employers announced first in 1936 and again a year later that they were
considering a severe wage cut for weavers of no less than 25%. But
they had overplayed their hand. At the end of 1937, at the initiative of
the MKU, the weavers went on strike. Within a few weeks, workers from
other departments joined the strike _en masse_ and it spread to 47 mills.
The TLA refused to support the strike and even succeeded in persuading
the Congress-led administration of Bombay state, which had shortly
before been installed in Bombay, to declare it illegal. The Gandhian
union did, however, support the workers' demands for a wage rise rather
than a cut, to shorten the working day to eight hours, and to ban night
shifts for longer than six months at a stretch. Shocked by the threat posed
by the 'socialist menace', the employers refused to negotiate with the
MKU, saying they would only deal with the TLA. Eventually, fearing
escalation in a more radical direction, the AMA --- which now had more
members than ever --- agreed to a 9% wage increase. Perhaps even
more importantly, the employers also agreed to accept arbitration as a
method of settling disputes and to standardization of the terms of
employment in all mills for the different types of work. This last
concession put an end to the practice of forcing weavers to take home
any flawed material they had produced as part of their wage and to sell it
in the open market. The dynamics of the struggle --- with competing
representatives of labour interests, employers following a collision course,
either individually or collectively, disruption and subsequent restoration
of the AMA--TLA axis, and finally, the transfer of state power from the
British administration to the Congress Party --- crystallized in a balance
of power that would remain in place for decades. Patel has succinctly
described the configuration that emerged at the end of the 1930s as
follows:

>To the TLA, the issue of the 1937 strike was not the demand for wage increases
but socialist involvement in these demands. As a result, it was willing to
collaborate with the mill owners to marginalise the MKU. The Congress ministry
sanctioned the use of the repressive machinery in the city during the strike, its
first repressive measure after acceptance of office. These events institutionalised
a relationship between the TLA and the AMA in the context of the Congress
coming to power. Henceforth this linkage would mediate in the tensions and
their resolutions and determine the nature of the capital-labour relationship in
Ahmedabad. (Patel 1987: 132)

Now that Congress politicians held power in the regional government in
West India, the TLA was free to increase its own influence in state
policies. After extensive discussion, the union leadership decided to
stand for the two seats in the Bombay Legislative Assembly reserved for
representatives of organized labour. The nomination of Gulzarilal Nanda
and Khandubhai Desai for these positions led to their very active
involvement in the design of a new plan of action for labour in the
modern sector of the economy. Textiles were by far the most important
branch of industrial production and a Textile Labour Enquiry Committee
was set up to further elaborate the schemes already in their portfolio.
The findings and recommendations in the final report of this panel of
advisors, which was not published until 1940, reflected Gandhi's ideas as
put into practice by the TLA. The proposal to introduce a minimum
wage,
for example, was based on Gandhi's belief that all workers should
earn enough to provide them with a decent living. This was in turn
founded on the sum required to meet the basic needs of a whole family,
consisting of the working man, his wife and two children under 14.
These were expressed in statistical units of 1.0, 0.8 and twice 0.6
respectively. It was thus a simple matter to determine the minimum wage
required to live, based on the costs of food and housing (on the basis of
a floor area for the entire family of 180 square feet and a rent of seven
rupees a month in Ahmedabad).

>For a typical family of a husband, wife and two children, the range of total
expenditure for maintaining a living wage standard we calculate at between ₹50 and ₹55 for Bombay and at between ₹45 and ₹50 for Ahmedabad.[^/7/1] _We
cannot, for our typical family, make any allowance for the earnings of the wife_ \[Italics
mine\]. (Kamath and Kher 1993: 316)

Recommendations in an interim advisory report by the committee were
transposed into legislation, in the form of the 1938 Bombay Industrial
Disputes Act. The Act was firmly based on Gandhian principles, as
outlined before. Gandhi's approach to the labour issue, which became
known as 'the Ahmedabad experiment', would provide the basis for
industrial legislation relating to the modern sector of the economy in the
post-colonial era. The BIDA expressed the essence of this strategy: 'the
promotion of amicable and peaceful settlement of industrial settlements
by conciliation and arbitration'. In this view, the much more radical
course followed by the labour movement in Bombay --- resulting in a
wave of strikes --- had not only led to a fall in production, but had also
robbed the workers of the income they needed so badly. Statistics were
produced to back up this argument. The 471 strikes in Bombay between
1926 and 1934 meant a loss of almost 35 million working days for the
three-quarters of a million participants. In the same period, the mill
workers in Ahmedabad lost only 138 working days through industrial
agitation, as a result of which their loss of earnings was only 427 lakhs
(Kamath and Kher 1993: 427). Strikes --- the message was clear --- were to
be avoided. They were a last resort measure, only to be used if employers
refused to grant the fair and just demands of the workers, demands
which had already taken account of the interests of the opposite party.
The father of the nation left no room for doubt as to the rightness of his
choice for a strategy in which the focus was on reconciliation rather than
conflict with capital. In his view, the experience in Ahmedabad had
proved the excellence and general applicability of the strategy.

>I am responsible for the organization of Ahmedabad labour. I am of the opinion
that it is a model for all India to copy. Its basis is non-violence, pure and simple.
It has never had a set back in its career. It has gone on from strength to strength,
without fuss and without show ... If I had my way, I would regulate all the labour
organisations of India after the Ahmedabad model. (quoted in Kamath and Kher
1993: 326)

[^/7/1]: A salary of this size represented just under double the amount that Banker had
calculated in 1917.

Nanda, who had been appointed Parliamentary Secretary of Labour in
the Congress government in Bombay, bore the political responsibility for
formulating and implementing the BIDA. One provision that met with
much opposition was the institutional framework within which negotiations
between employers and employees were regulated. Unions with a
membership of less than 25% of the total workforce of the
industry or occupational group involved were excluded from bargaining
on changes to the system of industrial relations. If more than one union
fulfilled the requirements for admission to the talks and registered for
participation in one of the zones into which the province was divided,
the largest would be granted the right to represent labour in the zone
concerned. In addition, the few employee organizations that were successful
in meeting these severe criteria committed themselves to acting
only in strict compliance with the principle of arbitration.

While in Bombay the left-wing labour movement protested vociferously
against this restrictive regulation, opposition in Ahmedabad came
largely from the employers. Many of the mill owners affiliated to the
AMA were not very enthusiastic about having to determine terms and
conditions of employment together with the TLA instead of acting as
they themselves saw fit. They not only considered this a threat to their
dominant position but also objected to the Gandhian union being given
the monopoly in representing the workers. They preferred to split the
opposition among a variety of representative bodies. Divided --- a situation
which the employers did not even have to encourage --- the workers
would not be so difficult to control. The majority of the AMA members,
convinced they were right, refused to register their own organization as
representative of the employers' interests. When, at the end of 1939, the
TLA leadership invoked a section from the Industrial Disputes Act
which provided for compensation for workers for the rising cost of
living, the AMA refused to grant the bonus and to accept the outcome of
the subsequent arbitration. The union, which felt threatened in its now
authorized legitimacy, made it known that it would not fight shy from
using the last means available to it, if it should prove necessary. In a
message to the workers of Ahmedabad in early 1940, Gandhi gave the
call for a general strike his blessing.

>Fellow worker brothers and sisters: Bhai Gulzarilal has explained the whole
situation to me. I feel that your demand is just. If we do not get justice through
arbitration or any other method, we have the only remedy of a strike. This
weapon is to be used with thought and discrimination. If we are not strong
enough, there is no shame in sitting quiet. But once we have taken this weapon
on hand, we must not rest until we secure justice. I have pointed out a solution
since years for it. \[_After this fighting talk Gandhi repeated the call he made during
the first strike in 1918 that the workers should seek alternative ways of earning a
living for the duration of the stoppage_\] All of you should learn another trade or
occupation whereby you can tide over the period of unemployment. I have
shown that one occupation which all can take to is spinning-weaving. I have no
objection if you find out any other occupation. Moreover, all those who are
better placed should help their weaker brethren. If this is done you can become
fearless. If the strike is averted this time, you will act on my suggestion for
learning a second occupation. (quoted in Kamath and Kher 1993: 334)

The presence of 65,000 workers at a meeting on the day before the strike
demonstrated their willingness to heed the call to lay down tools _en
masse_. With the prospect of a long general strike just at the time when the
outbreak of the Second World War promised to give production a
powerful boost, the employers pulled back from their chosen course of
confrontation. This U-turn at such a crucial moment was also partly the
result of heavy pressure on private business by the Congress government
in Bombay to support a system of industrial relations based on the
Gandhian notion of an alliance between labour and capital. As a result,
in 1940, the association of textile magnates in Ahmedabad declared that
they would accept the principles and procedures laid down in the BIDA,
including the provision on compulsory arbitration.

The coalition with the Congress movement had assured the TLA such
a headstart over its rivals that they were no longer able to catch up. In the
years that followed, a number of smaller but more radical unions
remained active in the mills in Ahmedabad. Their leaders comforted
themselves with the thought that they were a thorn in the side of the TLA
and ensured that, as the 'representative union', it was aware of the
feelings and grievances of the rank and file. Labour militancy was kept
alive by bringing out documentation criticizing the agenda and record of
the Gandhian union, such as _Majur Mahajani Kalank Katha_ \[Black
Story of Majur Mahajan\] in 1946. Booklets like this one must have
circulated as a kind of underground literature in the mill localities.

Would the competition between the various players in the struggle for
emancipation of the organized vanguard of industrial society have had a
different outcome if the leaders of the future national state had not so
unequivocally chosen the side of the TLA? There is no doubt that those
who advocated a labour movement that explicitly rejected reconciliation
in favour of emphasizing the contradictions between major economic
classes in the city found themselves in a marginal position and were given
little space to make their voice heard. Exactly when some elements in the
industrial proletariat showed a tendency to increased militancy, regulations
were introduced, at least in Ahmedabad, which attenuated the
mobilization of the class struggle.

### Social Awareness on the basis of Primordial Loyalties

A recurring theme in the history of the TLA is that high-caste leaders
continually and patiently tried to show the workers the way to a more
sophisticated way of life. This strategy is based on a distorted view from
the top, which emphasizes the 'backward' nature of the rank and file and
does not do justice to the assertion shown by this growing contingent
among the working population. Successive generations of the mass of
workers by no means blindly followed the path set out for them, and
often departed from it in unpredictable ways. If the Gandhian leaders
went too far in their willingness to reach a compromise with the mill
owners, the members did not hesitate to make it clear that they preferred
a more confrontational course of action. However, it would be incorrect
to give the impression that, where collective action was concerned, the
main issue was whether to mobilize on the basis of class solidarity or not.
The mill workers displayed a desire to preserve their identities along lines
of caste and religion, not only as the consequence of social construction
and manipulation from above, but also from their own choice. The
decision to join the TLA or not and voting preferences in the elections
for Ahmedabad city council were largely determined by communal
background. The fact that Muslims were employed in departments
where there were few workers from other groups --- for example in
drawing-in (_sarni_ in Gujarati), in the initial stage of weaving --- led to the
setting up of a separate union for this occupation. They felt more at
home here than in the TLA, with its dominant Hindu style. It is
interesting, however, that they did not attribute the founding of their
own union to their Muslim identity, but claimed that the Gandhian
union was too much under the influence of the mill owners (RCIL 1931,
vol 1/II: 163). Primordial loyalties were the main reason for them voting
for the Muslim League instead of for Congress, even when the candidate
for the latter was a mill worker. Their status as textile workers was no
more than one of a number of reference points, albeit an important one,
in determining their social behaviour. This was illustrated in early 1940
when Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the President of the Muslim League,
visited the city and addressed a crowd of 35,000, all Muslims. A year
later, the Bombay Provincial Muslim Conference met in Ahmedabad.

>Communal tension was in the air. The rumour that Sikhs were about to take out
a procession and play loud music in front of the Jumma Masjid lit the spark. On
17 April 1941 groups attacked each other with sticks. Businesses closed down.
Cars, shops, offices and houses were burned despite police patrolling of the tense
city. On the next day the rioting and burning increased. The fire brigade could
not cope. The police used tear gas to disperse the mobs. The district magistrate
declared a night curfew for fourteen days. The next day riots were still worse
although six truckloads of troops were called in. The Governor of Bombay
visited the city, bringing temporary calm, but on 22 April riots spread to the mill
areas of Raipur, Saraspur and Rakhial, outside the city walls. An estimated
50,000 workers left the city and only a handful of mills were operating.
(S.Raychaudhuri, quoted in the Spodek manuscript chapter 7: 12--3)

Employees from the untouchable castes were also, although for different
reasons, motivated by communal considerations. The desire for emancipation
that had evolved in this milieu was expressed in a growing
orientation towards social movements which challenged the established
order more fundamentally than Gandhi and his bourgeois disciples
considered acceptable. The reforms which the latter were willing to
support did not go far enough for their critics. This particularly applied
to the principle of untouchability, which had led in Gujarat, no less than
elsewhere, to such abject practices. The growing popularity of Ambedkar
as leader of the untouchable castes in West India was made clear during
his visits to Ahmedabad, first in 1928 and then again in 1931. His tour
was organized by activists who had formed the Untouchable Welfare
Organization in one of the mill districts. In his speeches, Ambedkar
rejected Gandhi's programme for putting a stop to the misery of those at
the base of society, saying that little had come of the promise to put an
end to their social exclusion. That could only be achieved, he said, by
adopting a militant stand against the inequality on which the caste
system was based, and in particular by taking action against the exploitation
and oppression of the lower echelons of that hierarchy. In the
industrial districts where the untouchables lived, conflict developed
between the supporters of Ambedkar and TLA officials, who advocated
Gandhi's ideas. A retired mill worker active in the former group described
his memories of this episode as follows.

>Congress had developed a hatred for Dr. Babasaheb, as he had become a threat to
Gandhiji and Congress men. So, when Babasaheb arrived in Ahmedabad to hold
discussions on the management of the Khanpur hostel \[note: a hostel for
Depressed Classes to be opened in this locality in 1931\], _Harijan_ leaders
associated with the _Mahajan_ (_Majoor Sangh_) expressed their protest with black
flags. In 1942--43 I came into contact with two staunch Ambedkar followers,
Aaljibhai Kareliya and Mohanlal D. Ambedkarwadi, who told me the names of
_Harijan_ volunteers in _Mahajan_. The centres of the Ambedkar movement in
Ahmedabad were mainly in Dariyapur, Shapur, Kothinovas, Rakhial, etc. They
entered into conflict with _Mahajan_ when Navyug Mandal was started. _Mahajan_
was following Gandhian principles. So, those _Harijan_ volunteers attached with
_Mahajan_ and Congress obeyed the orders of their leaders to wave the black flags.
(Parmar 1989: 13).

The same activist suggested in a magazine article some years later that
Ambedkar's visits to the city had in fact been arranged by jobbers who
felt threatened by the TLA's grip over the workers in the spinning shops
(Parmar and Chaudhari 1998: 66). But the enormous goodwill enjoyed
by Gandhi, especially among textile workers from the untouchable
castes, ensured that the more radical challenge to his ideology was unable
to prevail on a large scale during the last decade before Independence.
The segmentation of labour within the mill walls, recruited and organized
according to their separate identities, was reflected in the pattern of
Gandhian-inspired welfare activities that the TLA undertook in the
residential neighbourhoods. These activities seem to have been aimed
much more at the subaltern Hindu castes than at Muslims. The trend
towards segregation of the latter in the urban economy and the political
arena in Ahmedabad, which was to become even stronger in the postcolonial
era, was illustrated by the differentiated manner of representation
of the interests of the diverse segments into which the working mass
was divided according to caste and religion. This segmentation was not
corrected because, in their mobilization strategies, a wide range of social
actors --- including not only the representative organizations of employers
and employees, but also political parties and the urban bureaucracy
--- tended to focus on verticality (primordial social formations)
above horizontality (prioritizing common grievances on a class or locality
basis).

### Years of Prosperity

Despite the general pessimism of the employers about the persistent
deterioration in the economic situation, it is clear in hindsight that the
textile industry in Ahmedabad, which produced primarily for the domestic
market, emerged from the crisis relatively unscathed. As can be
seen from Table 2.2, the number of mills rose from 72 in 1930 to 82 in
the years that followed and fell again to 77 in 1939. Their combined
spinning and weaving capacity followed a similar trend. This picture of
consolidation is further strengthened by the fact that, in spite of the
setbacks during the years of economic recession, the volume of spindles
and looms was 10% and 20% higher respectively at the end
of the decade than at its start. Company results also show that --- unlike
in Bombay --- the industry as a whole did not make a net loss in any year.
Although profits fell drastically, particularly between 1934 and 1936,
the balance --- however, small --- remained positive. One indication that
things were not going so badly was that many mills continued with the
night shift, using day workers who doubled their efforts to compensate
for the loss of earnings for the family caused by women being made
redundant. Behind this pattern of stability and even growth across the
board, however, the industry was radically restructured. While a number
of mills with old and obsolete machinery were closed, new ones opened
with modern equipment that made higher productivity possible. This
led to intensification of the labour process, as part of the policy of
rationalization, which --- as we have seen --- affected the women particularly
badly. By upscaling, a number of prominent textile magnates were
able to bring down production costs considerably. The redundancy of
large numbers of workers by mills that closed down or by rationalization
in those that stayed open, was compensated for by the employment of
large numbers of newcomers to the city in the newly opened mills.
Comparison of the size of the working population in 1930 and 1939
(more than 64,000 and almost 78,000 respectively) indicates a growth of
no less than 20%. This statistic, impressive in itself, becomes even
more significant when it is realized that the turnover of workers leaving
and entering the labour market must have been far greater. The effect of
the recession on the rural economy meant that many of the newcomers
who found work in the new mills were migrants pushed out from the
agrarian economy: Hindus from villages in Saurasthra and Hindus or
Muslims from further away in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

The leap forwards in production in the war years, together with the
higher prices, resulted in fabulous profits for the textile manufacturers.
As imports from Britain and Japan dried up, competition on the domestic
market disappeared and the war effort led to large orders. Although
the number of mills did not increase, production capacity expanded
further and with it, the size of the workforce. With the introduction of
a three-shift system the machines were used more intensively than ever
before. The number of people working nights went up from less than
12,000 in 1936 to almost 50,000. The new alliance between the TLA
and the AMA assured the restoration of industrial peace. Wage levels
remained far below that of rising profits but working conditions improved.
The arbitration which employers had to agree to in early 1940
led in 1943 to the introduction of a dearness allowance as compensation
for the increased cost of living. The rise may have been a third less than
the union had demanded but the right to a cost-of-living allowance
should nevertheless be seen as a step forward in the rapid improvement
in terms of employment. When production came to a standstill for more
than three months in 1942, it was not because of an industrial dispute.
For the first time, employers and employees united in a political strike to
protest against the arrest of Gandhi and many other leading members of
Congress. The arrests were the colonial administration's response to the
Quit India campaign. Gulzarilal Nanda and Khandubhai Desai, at that
time joint secretaries of the TLA, were among those detained for an
indefinite period. The authorities tried in vain to persuade the mills to
resume production. They refused, claiming that the workers would not
turn up anyway (Karnik 1967: 324). Attempts by the communist
movement to sabotage the strike also came to nothing in Ahmedabad.

Towards the end of the 1940s the leaders of the Gandhian union had
good reason to look back on the success of the 'righteous struggle' with
satisfaction. Membership had swelled to 55,000, bringing the %age
of the workforce belonging to the union back to the level of the early
days after the TLA had been set up and showed that the majority of the
workers trusted the union's chosen course. The TLA's leaders provided
statistics to illustrate this success. According to their figures, while textile
workers in Ahmedabad had earned 20% less than their colleagues
in Bombay in 1920, by the late 1940s they were being paid 10%
more, giving them the highest wage level of any textile centre in the
country (quoted in Lakha 1988: 115). The increase in self-confidence,
power, and wealth led to new initiatives. In 1947, the TLA set up its own
bank from which members could obtain loans on favourable terms. This
was to make it possible for them to finance non-recurrent expenses ---
children's weddings, the purchase of a house, or home repairs --- without
having to borrow money from private moneylenders. The number of
account holders at the bank rose from 7,000 in the first year to more
than 32,000 in 1961--2. With contributions from the members --- the
five-rupee donation was officially voluntary, but it was almost impossible
to avoid paying it --- the TLA was able to build a new head office. In
1945, Anasuyaben laid the first stone and, on completion of the new
building, received back her garage and a number of other buildings
around her bungalow, which had been the humble offices of the union
since its foundation. In 1950, the membership records were transferred
to the new premises, a much larger building than that housing the AMA.
The Gandhi Majoor Sevalaya had four storeys and became the centre of
activities for leaders, staff, and members. Its location next to the bus
station in the old city centre made it easily accessible from the textile
districts.

### From Local Experiment to National Model

The prominent position acquired by the TLA within the landscape of
organized labour had an impact far beyond Ahmedabad. In 1947
Gulzarilal Nanda, who was now Minister of Labour in the state of
Bombay, replaced the BIDA --- which dated from before the war --- with
the Bombay Industrial Relations Act. The word 'dispute' no longer
appeared in the name of the new Act, so that even the appearance of
confrontation could be avoided. The rule that unions were only authorized
to represent employees in negotiations if their members totalled at
least a quarter of the workforce in their specific branch was made slightly
less restrictive by lowering the percentage to 15. But disputes still had to
be submitted for arbitration before --- and only in the very last instance ---
strike action could be taken. In 1957 Nanda left for Delhi to become
Minister of Labour in the central government and Deputy Chairman of
the Planning Commission. This gave him the opportunity to apply the
Ahmedabad experiment' nationwide. He was the architect of what
became known in the planned economy as the 'new labour policy'. The
formula was based on three-way consultations between employers, employees,
and government. The TLA took up exactly the same leading
position within organized labour nationally as it had in Ahmedabad.
Repeated attempts to persuade this vehicle of Gandhi's ideas to join the
All India Trade Union Congress were futile. The TLA's criticism of the
left-wing labour movement received a boost when these leaders opposed
the Quit India campaign, arguing that industrial production should go
ahead in the interest of the anti-imperialist war effort. Shortly before
Independence the Indian National Trade Union Congress was set up.
Sardar Patel, who chaired the meeting at which it was founded, explained
why national interest should take priority over international solidarity
with the working class.

>In their blind opposition to the Government, the communist labour leaders have
thrown all regard for national welfare to the winds. ... No more grafting or
transplantation of a foreign ideology and method, however suited to the conditions
elsewhere, is likely to yield healthy results here. What is required is an
indigenous movement having its roots in the Indian soil. Such a movement has
for long been in existence and has attained a remarkable degree of success
through a number of unions in several centres. But generally speaking these
unions have held themselves aloof from the AITUC. Today they are coming
together to form a new national organisation. (quoted in Kamath and Kher
1993: 371)

The alternative on offer did not, like the AITUC, call for a class
struggle but aimed at harmonizing the interests that kept national capital
and labour separate. At Sardar Patel's suggestion, the meeting founding
the INTUC in 1947 appointed Khandubhai Desai as its first SecretaryGeneral.
He later became its President and eventually ended his career as
Minister of Labour. Like Nanda before him, Desai made his mark on
national labour policies for many years and established contacts with
like-minded colleagues in other countries. The accession of the INTUC
to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions during the
Cold War era was a logical step. At a congress of this anti-communist
organization in Berlin in 1962, Desai set out the Gandhian programme
that had inspired him from the start of his career in Ahmedabad.

>The employers and the management, in these days of democracy and freedom,
are only an appendage of the economic apparatus. As Mahatma Gandhi, who
also was a great trade unionist, used to tell and preach to us, there is no employer
or employee. The principles that we must place before ourselves are that both are
co-trustees of society and the community as a whole. In order to create that
psychology he used to tell us that workers should have the sensation and
psychology of working as co-owners in industry, while the management or
employer should reorient their minds to think that they are co-workers in the
field. (quoted in Majmundar 1973: 117)

Desai's successor as Secretary-General of the Delhi-based INTUC also
came from the TLA. His appointment represented a continuation of the
prominent role of Gandhi's disciples in the design of the planned
economy in the first decade after Independence. An important step
forward in labour legislation was taken in 1950 when the Employees'
Provident Fund was introduced, with the support of the government.
The scheme provided for a benefit paid at the age of retirement from
contributions by both employer and employee while the latter was
employed.

The expansion of the industry continued unabated in the 1950s and
remained a major cause for the growing number of inhabitants (591,267
in 1941 to 837,163 in 1951). In 1959, there were 141,884 workers
employed in the textile mills of Ahmedabad. The number of women had
fallen to 5,487, making their share of the total workforce almost negligible
(less than 4%). The membership of the representative union
had risen to an unprecedented 80,587 by 1956. These growth statistics
must be placed in the context of the demographic expansion of
Ahmedabad and of the share of the working population employed in the
mills. The latter reached its peak between 1930 and 1950, and then fell
off gradually. This trend reflected the shift in the pattern of economic
activity caused by the emergence of other industries and of the service
sector in the city. Parallel to this process of diversification, the composition
of urban employment also changed. The number of households that
depended entirely or mainly on income from work in the textile mills no
longer exceeded those that lived from all other sources of income put
together. Although the smoking chimney stacks of the mills would
continue to dominate the skyline in Ahmedabad for another two decades,
the transition began to pick up momentum from the early 1960s on. The
textile magnates contributed to this development when they started to
invest their exorbitant profits in other economic activities of an industrial
or non-industrial nature rather than in expanding or modernizing
the textile branch. An increasing proportion of their capital was spent
outside the textile sector, much of it being used to build new residential
areas and business premises on the right bank of the river.

### Political Turbulence

In the second half of the 1950s, the peace in the textile industry was
disrupted once again, this time not by economic but by political turbulence.
The chain of events suggest that the ties between the leaders and
the members of the TLA were less close and cordial than the union's
records tended to suggest. The unrest started with a campaign to split
Gujarat from the state of Bombay. Why and how this campaign was
pursued is beyond the scope of this book. What is important here is that
the leaders of the separatist movement succeeded in acquiring the
support of the majority of the people of Ahmedabad. And against the
will of the Congress government, which opposed the formation of states
on the basis of language boundaries at both regional and national level.
As loyal allies of their fellow Gandhians in the political arena, the TLA
had adopted the same standpoint. Pamphlets were distributed and
demonstrations organized to bring the demand for a separate territory
for the Gujarati-speaking people to the attention of a wide public. A
march to Congress House in the centre of the city ended dramatically
when the police opened fire on the demonstrators and killed four of
them, all students. The _Maha Gujarat Janata Parishad_, which had been
set up by a number of prominent dissidents, had little difficulty in
stirring up anti-Congress sentiment among the people from the mid1950s
onwards. In May 1960, the separatists achieved their aim when
the state of Gujarat was formed.

Among the activists, who represented a broad spectrum of parties,
Indulal Yagnik had emerged as leader of the popular revolt. In the
struggle against colonial oppression, he had initially been a loyal disciple
of Gandhi. His different views on how to put a stop to the regime of
exploitation and oppression under which the poor masses in the cities
and in the countryside were forced to live resulted in an irrevocable loss
of confidence in and loyalty to the Mahatma. From an early stage, Yagnik
had been critical of the Congress leaders for not mobilizing the working
classes systematically in the interests of the nationalist cause, but only
occasionally and sporadically. This reluctance seemed to be fuelled by the
fear that, once they had been stirred to action, it would be no easy task
to bring the masses back under the control of the established order. That
was in any case the lesson that the Gandhian movement had learned
from the serious unrest in Ahmedabad that had accompanied the introduction
of the Rowlatt Acts in 1919. When Gandhi had called for
peaceful resistance to the Acts he had been arrested. The news of the
arrest led to widespread rioting in the city. Workers in the mills downed
tools and destroyed a large number of local offices of the colonial
administration in and outside the industrial districts. Many years later,
Yagnik described the shock with which Gandhi and his immediate staff
responded to the violence.

> ... all of them were thoroughly dumb-founded on seeing the burning lava of
popular fury that begun, as it were, to suddenly spout forth with demonial
energy from some mysterious subterranean vaults, and that kindled hell-fires all
over the city for three mad days. (quoted in Gillion 1971: 126--7)

After his release, Gandhi admonished the masses and said he suspected
that a few ringleaders had inflamed the situation rather than tried to cool
it down. He told his disciples to give urgent priority to educating the
lower classes in the non-violent principles of _satyagraha_ (Gillion 1968:169). The dominance of the right wing, led by Sardar Patel, prevented
Yagnik from finding much support for his radical left views within the
Congress movement. He left the movement as early as 1924, although he
did so reluctantly. After a long period away from active politics, he
eventually sought a new platform to achieve the social reforms he
envisaged. Returning from an extended stay out of the country, he
devoted his energies to improving the lot of the poor rural population
and, in 1936, together with a number of other supporters of the class
struggle, he set up a national farmers' union, the All Indian _Kisan_ Sabha.
The colonial administration grasped his radical views as an opportunity
to deny him access to the districts in Gujarat. He was only able to extend
his activities to the rural poor in the region after the Congress government
in Bombay came to power and lifted the ban. He established
several _ashrams_ in the vicinity of Ahmedabad to encourage school attendance,
particularly among tribals. Yagnik's charisma made him increasingly
popular until his reputation, especially among the working people of
Ahmedabad, equalled or even exceeded that of Gandhi.

Yagnik had placed himself at the head of the opposition to the
Congress government, which refused to submit to the will of the people
for separation from the state of Bombay. His return to the political arena
led to his appointment as chairman of the _Janata Parishad_. This party
aimed to capitalize on the success of the separatist movement, but
seemed at first to make little impression on voters in elections for
Ahmedabad city council and for the legislative assembly of the new state
of Gujarat. Congress returned to power in the city in 1969, thanks to the
support that the TLA managed to acquire for its candidates among the
working population. Of the 29 candidates nominated by the union for
the Congress party, 27 won their seats, of whom 21 of these had been
chosen by voters in the mill localities. TLA secretary Vasawada had made
clear to the union's members why they should not vote for any other
party than Congress.

>You have built an organization to find solutions to industrial questions. The TLA
looks after these questions on a daily basis. But just solving questions of pay,
inflation, bonus, and working conditions alone does not bring satisfaction to the
workers. The workers' neighbourhoods must be clean; when the workers return
home at night from the mills, there must be proper roads, and the roads must
have street lights; there must be clean water to drink and adequate water for
cleaning and bathing; there must be arrangements for the children's education.
There must be adequate health education and also arrangements for nursing
people who fall sick. Only if such basic facilities are maintained can the workers'
world be happy. The Municipality is responsible for all these tasks and therefore
it is of the utmost importance that the members we have chosen participate in
the administration of the Municipality. (quoted in Spodek, manuscript, chapter
7:34)

Although Yagnik himself was re-elected to the national parliament (Lok
Sabha) in 1962, the party he represented had little success in exercising
political power. The only way to achieve this was to campaign in the
working class districts and to persuade the mill workers that their loyalty
to the TLA and to Congress had not delivered what they had been
promised. Realizing this, Yagnik set up the Samyukta Kamdar Sangram
Samiti (United Workers' Battle Committee) in 1963. He had been
encouraged to set up the committee, which comprised the representatives
of 46 mills, after that year's annual celebration of Labour Day on 4
December had attracted far fewer workers than the 200,000 that had
come to a parallel event he had arranged on the same day. Yagnik
expressed his low opinion of the TLA's achievements and sharply criticized
the authoritarian and paternalistic style of its leaders.

> ... this trade union has helped more to keep down the militant spirit of the
workers than to inspire them to fight for their rights. And though it can boast of
setting up a few schools, dispensaries and a hospital for the benefit of the
labouring classes, it has proved most reactionary from the standpoint of class
welfare. It has refused to associate in any way with the All-India Trade Union
Congress, and with other international organisations. Indeed, Mr. Gandhi and
his lieutenants have succeeded in turning Ahmedabad labour into their own
special preserve over which they preside and dominate to further their own
power and glory. (quoted in Majmundar 1973: 199)

The eloquence with which Yagnik explained his socialist ideas was
combined with a casual, easy-going manner which made the workers feel
that he was one of them, that he sympathized with their situation and
understood their needs and wishes. The working class activists who
supported him worked together with small, more radical unions. Lal
Vavta and the MKU in particular had succeeded in maintaining their
modest membership in a number of mills and among certain occupational
groups, despite the monopoly position granted to the TLA by the
government. This is illustrated by the life story of Vasanthal Chauhan, a
_Dalit_ mill worker who took advantage of the welfare activities of the
Gandhian union. By taking part in courses and sports he came into
contact with supporters of the socialist movement and, at the end of the
1940s, joined the Socialist (Samajwadi) Party. He also helped to spread
Ambedkar's ideas and took part in a wide variety of activities to raise
political and social awareness. It was an arena in which local activists met
state-level personalities who had already achieved great fame. Below are
a number of passages from his memoirs, which portray a clear picture of
the view from below.

>I also arranged at various places birth anniversary celebrations of Dr. Babasaheb
>Ambedkar. I invited V.I. Parmar, Dinkar Mehta, Govindji T. Guru, etc., for such
>meetings. I also arranged programmes of _bhajans_ and religious discussions by a
>renowned Buddhist Pagalbaba (mad saint) who had come to Ahmedabad.
>Discussions held were on topics like no soul, atheism, zeroism (_shunyawad_), etc.
>Such thoughts did give a jolt to the traditionally brought-up _Dalits_, but the show
>went on nicely. Songs and _bhajans_ were well received. A few _bhajan_ parties were
>followed by lectures and then discussions ensued. At times, it went on for many
>nights to seek a possible solution for certain issues. \[Note: _In his account Chauhan
>refers to his joining Yagnik's movement_\]. . ... Many socialists like Dinkar Mehta
>joined him. I being a person of activity also joined the movement, many others
>followed suit. Large meetings were being held at the gates of the mills. I used to
>take lead in warming up these meetings. Under the banner of Maha Gujarat
>Parishad, Indulal Yagnik and Karsandas Parmar[^/7/2] won the parliament election
>with a huge margin. Ahmedabad, the den of Congress and _Majoor Mahajan_ was
>again active and the equation of politics changed. I came in contact with
>communists. Many of my young associates had joined the party and so I
>followed their example. The basic point is that I long for a fundamental change.
>Exploitation in daily life in society and politics made me feel restless. My belief,
>that communist ideology will break this capitalist social system, had strengthened
>during this period.
>
> ... Indulal Yagnik, Dinkar Mehta and other communist as well as socialist
>leaders took up the labour welfare activities under the auspices of the Sangram
>Samiti. They loudly voiced the demands of the workers. This movement, like
>Maha Gujarat, had a great impact on Ahmedabad. (quoted in Parmar 1989: 33,35)

### Slow and Inadequate Progress

Was it only his rhetorical talents and the complete lack of servility in his
actions that assured Yagnik, who himself originated from a high _Brahman_
caste in Gujarat, such easy access to the milieu of industrial labour?
His popularity seemed to be founded primarily on the conviction that he
expressed in word and deed that the proletarian vanguard of the working
population were still exploited and oppressed. In their name, he dared to
challenge the government and other political leaders for their failure to
tackle working-class poverty resolutely and honestly. While the secretary
of the Gandhian union urged its members to vote for Congress candidates
in the municipal elections, where they would call for better public
services in the industrial districts, they lacked what they needed most ---
sufficient and adequate housing. M.M. Malaviya, a prominent leader of
the independence movement, took advantage of a speech to the AMA
during his second visit to Ahmedabad to express sharp criticism of the
misery in which the working population were forced to live.

>I have returned to Ahmedabad not to make speeches but to see the conditions of
the workers. I have seen the workers' _chawls_. How can the Ahmedabad Municipality
allow such _chawls_ in the twentieth century? There ought to be an
arrangement for housing the workers. If they have no facility for drinking water,
where will they get water for bathing? Without bathing they cannot do good
work. The lack of toilets is also painful. Form a plan for housing the workers!
(quoted in Spodek 2002: 219--20)

[^/7/2]: Karsandas Parmar was a leader of the Republican Party who was active in Saurashtra
on the issue of land redistribution to the landless.

Perhaps in response to this appeal, in the years that followed the
Ahmedabad Mill Housing Company built 2,282 one-room and 467
two-room dwellings. 28 mills contributed to the costs, which amounted
to less than 100 homes per sponsor. The larger type tenement consisted
of a room of 14×12 square feet, a _verandah_ of 7×12 square feet and a
kitchen of 12x6 square feet. In the late 1940s, this company had
delivered 800 tenements which were rented out for ₹4.50 a month.
The TLA itself built a colony of 60 houses, each with two rooms, a
kitchen, a _verandah_ and a yard, at a monthly rent of ₹10. In addition,
the union had supported the foundation of six cooperative housing
societies with a total of 400 semi-detached workers' homes. Lastly, the
city council also built 837 tenements at its own expense. This summary
shows that the supply of houses fell far short of the enormous demand.
And for the time being, this deplorable situation was to change very
little. Due to overcrowding and neglect by landlords many mill localities
turned into slums. According to a municipal report, in the early 1950s
Ahmedabad had 1600 _chawls_, half of which had no sewers or toilets.

The labour regime in the mills also continued to fall short of the
minimum level of human dignity. An American researcher who studied
the social tensions in the textile industry in Ahmedabad in 1953 described
the situation he had _encountered_ in the following short passage.

>The reader may or may not know what the noise, dirt, crowding and confusion
of a textile mill is like. He may or may not know or guess, on the basis of what
he has read, that mill life, like most life in India, is very hard. Without entering
into detail, I will merely remind him that men put in their lives in a grinding,
deafening, sweltering job at a wage which just supports life, without any
retirement allowance or health insurance. (Murphy 1953: 229)

The report published in 1951 by the Industrial Conditions Enquiry
Committee, set up by the government, adopted a similar tone. At the
suggestion of a worker, one of the committee's members tried to spend
ten minutes in one of the steam-filled departments. Although he did no
work, he found the experience almost unbearable. According to the
report, the problem of 'loitering', about which the employers complained
incessantly, was a direct result of 'the abnormal working conditions in
most factories' (Final Report 1953: 59). Recommendations by the
committee for the mills to be made lighter, more airy and cooler were
dismissed out of hand by the textile magnates in their now air-conditioned
offices as unnecessary and too expensive.

Complaints from the early and later generations of workers in the
textile mills in the Manchester of India about the abominable conditions
in which they were forced to work and the cruelty of the manufacturers
are rarely recorded in writing. But _Majoor Sandesh_ occasionally published
contributions which protested strongly about the denial of dignity
for those involved in the labour process. This is expressed in the following
poem:

>Talapi talapi maro mara, uchali uchali maro mara
>
>Sramajivina sa che bhara! Bolese samun lagara!
>
>Bole bole maro mara, samun juve maro mara,
>
>Chode sanca maro mara, dharaine baso maro mara.

Through his own organization, Yagnik and his disciples opposed the
TLA ideology and its practical effects on daily life. The aim was to apply
pressure on the Gandhian union, but not to bring about its demise by
encouraging workers to cancel their membership. One of the issues on
which the left-wing activists focused was corruption. It was common
practice for shopfloor bosses to demand illicit payments or other favours
from the workers under their charge before they would grant their
requests, be it the employment of a son, a permanent employment
contract, time off from work or permission to live in a company house.
The power of the _mukadam_ had increasingly been taken over by the
_pratinidhi_, the shop stewards who were the official representatives of the
union on the shopfloor. Like their predecessors, they used their position
to acquire extra income and other benefits. The same applied to some of
the administrative staff at the union office. It was these practices that
inspired Yagnik's call to fight the corruption that was rife in the TLA
apparatus.

In 1964 a dispute between the employers' and employees' organizations
about the size of a cost-of-living allowance provided Yagnik with an
opportunity to further inflame the workers' dissatisfaction with the slow
and inadequate way in which their interests were represented. An adjustment
to the Consumer Price Index made it necessary to set a new rate.
Because the employers did not agree with the change, a new, extended
round of arbitration was necessary before the dispute could be settled. At
the same time the employers had offered stubborn resistance to the
maintenance of the existing bonus scheme. This dated back to 1920,
when the mill owners first decided to give their workers a little extra at
_divali_. The latter had demanded a bonus of some kind when they realized
that the high profits of the preceding years had disappeared entirely into
the bosses' pockets. Some employers gave generously, distributing extra
money on the pay-day that fell in this season, along with the traditional
sweets and candies. The workers then however began to see this as a
right, and not as an occasional payment, but as a monthly bonus.
Gandhi condemned this pressure on the employers as immoral. The
dialogue that ensued between him and the workers illustrated their
different standpoints and the lack of comprehension on both sides.

>A demand for bonus, said Gandhi, could only be made at the end of the year and
that, too, after studying the company balance-sheets. To ask for a bonus on a
month-to-month basis without any policy directive was improper. In any event,
Gandhi held, it was wrong to bring pressure on the mill owners. But this was not
agreeable to the workers' representatives. One of them got up and said, 'Gandhiji,
we are poor and wish to get whenever and whatever we can get. We do not
trouble you in this matter but take whatever we can get on our own from the mill
owners.' But Gandhi stuck to his guns and told them abruptly: 'Your conduct
against morality cannot be tolerated. And if you insist in behaving thus, I will
have to distance myself from your work and also ask Anasuyaben to do so.' It was
difficult for the representatives to understand what the morality involved was.
They said: 'We make a simple demand; the mill owners readily accede to it.
Where does morality come in the picture? What wrong have we done? We
continue as before.' In that case Gandhi told the men 'You can take away your
papers, your account books and your money. He and Anasuya would resign.'
(Kamath and Kher 1993: 203--4)

The workers gave in and left it to the TLA leadership to negotiate a
bonus scheme. A year later, after arbitration, the employers consented to
the payment of an extra monthly salary at the end of each year. They
continued, however, to see the bonus --- including the amount --- as a
favour that they were free to grant or withhold. In 1946, the problem reemerged
because the employers refused to make what had become
common practice in the preceding years into a binding agreement.

The _Janata Parishad_ party seized the opportunity presented by the
new friction between the TLA and the AMA to take ongoing disputes
about a cost-of-living allowance and the bonus scheme beyond the
negotiating table by calling a public protest against the continually rising
cost of living. The protest, which lasted a week, spread to become a
general strike aimed at bringing public life to a standstill throughout the
state. The arrest of a number of ringleaders under the National Security
Act came too late to stem the swell of unrest. The Gujarat _bandh_ was
celebrated with a big parade, in which tens of thousands of factory
workers took part. The success of the action was illustrated by the fact
that 60--70% of total industrial capacity remained unused on that
day. The government tried unsuccessfully to break the illegal strike
through massive deployment of the police. Six demonstrators lost their
lives during violent clashes in the city centre. Public opinion was shocked
and, in the elections of the following year, the faltering Congress machinery
suffered its greatest ever defeat. Indulal Yagnik had stood as a
candidate for the Lok Sabha. He defeated Khandubhai Desai, who had
become Minister of Labour in the central government after his career
with the TLA, with an overwhelming majority.

Chauhan, the _Dalit_ activist who himself came from the working class,
described from memory how he experienced the political landslide that
had once again occurred in Ahmedabad.

>_Janata Parishad_ had taken the reigns of Ahmedabad Municipality in its hand.
Until now only mill owners were able to become Mayor of the city, but the
political current had changed. Middle class had taken over these positions from
the elite. Popular physician Dr Somabhai Desai, Dr Vasudev Tripathi and
Dinkarbhai Mehta were one by one elected Mayor. A communist becoming
Mayor in this fort of Gandhi and Congress is very surprising and the news
floated all over the world. Priorities of public welfare changed during the _Janata
Parishad_ rule. In the past they had been firmly centred on the upper and middle
class. Now, under the new regime, the elite bias was over and the focus shifted to
the localities of workers and _Dalits_ in the industrial areas. The services of health
and sanitation were also diverted to the labour class. (quoted in Parmar 1989: 40--1)

_Janata Parishad_ was by far the largest faction in a coalition of several leftwing
parties that came to power in 1965. Candidates who, as always, had
been elected in the industrial constituencies on the instructions of the
TLA stood no chance at all. The policy pursued by the city authorities in
the years
that followed bore witness to a genuine shift in favour of the
working class and the areas in which they lived. It should come as no
surprise that this change in favour of the people met with strong
resistance from the established order. The bureaucratic apparatus, too,
seemed reluctant to fulfil the new tasks demanded of it. This opposition
from within --- which sometimes extended to sabotage --- was expressed in
a deterioration in the efficiency and effectiveness of the way in which the
municipal agencies fulfilled its political assignments. The extent to
which the administration met the requirements of good governance was
also affected by the differences of opinion --- both personal and political
--- between the leaders of the multiparty alliance. In addition to
unkept promises and in-fighting, the antagonistic attitude among the
better-off classes was an important factor in the 1969 election campaign.
The coalition, which fought the elections as the _Janata Morcha_ (United
Front), lost its mandate and was reduced to a minuscule faction. The
return of Congress as the largest party on the city council meant an end
to the socialist intermezzo. Candidates with TLA backing won 25 seats
on the council, almost a quarter of the total. The turnaround seemed to
have no effect on Yagnik's popularity. The support for him in the textile
districts guaranteed his re-election to the national parliament from 1957
until his death in 1972. The death in the same year of Anasuyaben, the
lifelong leader of the Gandhian union, marked the end of an illustrious
era in the history of the labour movement in Ahmedabad. Many hundreds
of thousands of people attended Yagnik's cremation. Anasuyaben's
last ceremony attracted far fewer mourners, despite an urgent appeal
from the TLA to its members to turn up _en masse_ to show their last
respects to the union's leader.

### The Beginning of The End

The political recovery of Congress was not to last. The schism that Indira
Gandhi forced in 1969 at the central level led to a deep and bitter
division in the party ranks in Gujarat. Although Gandhian officials in
both urban and rural Gujarat largely remained loyal to the faction that
became known as Congress Old (Syndicate), there was massive support
among the people for Congress New or Renewed, led by Jawaharlal
Nehru's daughter, and known as 'Indicate'. Her decision to nationalize
the banks and even more so her pledge to fight poverty --- under the
slogan '_garibi hatao_' --- guaranteed her the support of the lower classes.
The fact that she and her followers betrayed this pledge in the years that
followed did nothing to weaken the trust placed in Indira Gandhi by the
deprived segments of society. This sustained support stemmed more
from the lack of an alternative than from anything else.

In the TLA, the old guard held the reins firmly in their hands. They
formed an old boys' network which had resisted for years the appointment
of younger officials to leading positions in the union. They still
showed no signs of stepping down, thereby preventing the change of
course the TLA needed so badly. The price paid for their 'resoluteness' ---
which was of course how they saw their inflexibility --- was exceptionally
high. Like the Gandhian veterans at the head of many other social
organizations in Gujarat, the TLA bosses were allied with the Old
Congress. By opting for a faction in which renowned right-wing politicians
had found their final refuge, the union leaders had manoeuvred
themselves into a political cul-de-sac. Their anti-Indira standpoint put a
stop to the stamp they had left on the labour system for decades, at both
state and national level. The Minister of Labour and other high-ranking
policy makers at central or state level no longer came from the labour
movement that had brought Ahmedabad fame at home and abroad.
When, in the early 1970s, the TLA leaders realized that they had bet on
the wrong horse, they made a timid and rather unconvincing attempt to
repair the damage. After first declaring that it wanted to remain politically
neutral, the union's directors set up their own party, the National
Labour Party. The party was not destined for a long life. The TLA's call
to its members to vote for the new party --- their party --- ended in disaster.
None of the candidates succeeded in winning a seat, either on the city
council or in the national parliament. The TLA leaders therefore switched
allegiance to the _Janata_ party, but again they failed to convince their rank
and file to follow suit. The righteous struggle continued. But the authorized
publications --- few leaders of the first order were able to resist the
temptation to write their memoirs --- recognized the tide against them
and adopted an aggrieved tone.

Remarkably, the political isolation of the TLA did not stop a further
growth in membership. The trend was to continue until 1980 when,
according to the union's records, 135,445 textile workers were on the
books. With the official statistics stating that in the same year 154,967
workers were employed in the textile mills, this amounts to a very high
organizational rate of almost 90%. The TLA claimed that nine out
of 10 workers in the mills were indeed members of the union (Masihi
1985: 18). The figures may exaggerate the situation somewhat; the first
could have included members in mills outside Ahmedabad. Even after
adjustment, however, by reducing the number of members by 10,000 or
15,000, the organizational rate of the TLA still does not fall below 75--80% of the working population in this branch of urban industry.
This statistic is a crucial factor in assessing the social role of the Gandhian
organization as 'representative union', even in later years. Yet this significance
must still be seen in context, for a completely different reason.
Compared with half a century earlier, the working population of the
textile industry had more than doubled in size: from 64,480 in 1930 to
154,967 in 1980.[^/7/3] However, while in 1930 the textile workers constituted
17% of the population, by 1980 this had fallen to 8%.[^/7/4] This relative decline reflected the diversification of the city's
economy since the early 1960s and the decreased importance of the
textile industry as a source of employment for its considerably expanded
population. In 1930, Ahmedabad had fewer than 400,000 inhabitants;
by 1981 this had grown to more than 2.5 million.

The greater pressure from the labour movement inspired by Yagnik
resulted in the TLA adopting a more assertive attitude in its negotiations
with the employers. This led to a relatively generous agreement on the
cost-of-living allowance and the controversial bonus scheme. Under a
regulation introduced in 1977, the workers received an annual payment
of at least 8.33% and a maximum of 20% of their wage.
While boasting about this agreement, the union simultaneously urged
the workers to generate the equivalent of 13 months production for the
12 months that they worked. The exhortation to increase productivity
on the workfloor was a veiled reference to the rationalization that the
manufacturers had introduced in the preceding years. The union leaders
cooperated in the implementation of this drive by not insisting on filling
vacancies for permanent jobs and by consenting to the redundancy of
several thousand employees. There was little shortage of 'volunteers', as
all those who took voluntary redundancy received a substantial one-off
payment. Another significant factor was that most of them had little
difficulty in finding work elsewhere. During this period, many mills
needed to take on more workers, both for the night shift and for newlyopened
departments where the finished cloth was further processed
(colouring and printing). The TLA proudly referred to this scheme,
which prevented a radical reduction in the total workforce in the textile
industry, as 'tearless rationalization' (Majmundar 1973: 232). This satisfaction
is understandable, but it must not be forgotten that the main
rationale behind the whole package of measures was to enable the
employers to cut labour costs drastically.

[^/7/3]: According to Sharma, the number of employees totalled 158,713 on 31 December
1979 (Sharma 1980: 04).

[^/7/4]: NB, both percentages refer to the entire population and not only to the working
population. The economic significance is therefore much greater than the figures would
suggest in both years mentioned.

In his study of industrial capitalism in Bombay, Chandavarkar points
out that it was generally more labour than capital intensive. The low level
of technology preferred by the employers meant that they needed to
employ large numbers of workers. The feelings of dependency that
resulted from this were expressed in dissatisfaction with the defective
quality of the badly trained workforce. The employers' perpetual complaints
about lack of efficiency must also be seen in this light. To increase
production, they intensified the workload rather than investing more
capital. They justified this strategy by accusing the workers of working
too slowly and of stopping work too easily for shorter or longer periods
to drink tea, smoke a cigarette, go to the toilet, or for no reason at all.
This behaviour testified to deficient sense of duty and forced the employers
to take on more workers than was necessary. From this viewpoint, the
best way to reduce production costs was to cut the cost of labour by
decreasing the size of the reserve workforce, tightening up surveillance
on the workfloor, and raising productivity by speeding up the machines
and reducing the number of people working on them. In short, rationalization.

These attitudes among the textile producers in Bombay and the
consequences they attached to them (Chandavarkar 1994:274--84) were
shared by the captains of industry in Ahmedabad in their approach to the
'labour problem'. It is revealing that the reasons given by the employers
to justify this intensification of the workers' tasks were not criticized by
the union. The excessive leniency which the Gandhian leadership repeatedly
displayed to understand the employers' position in this respect and
their compliance with the standpoint that increasing labour productivity
was a perfectly acceptable demand appeared to be based on Gandhi's
own idea that the working class lacked discipline in terms of desire to
achieve, punctuality and dedication. This prejudice is illustrated in a
passage on the logic of rationalization in Majmundar's book on the
history of the TLA. The text is also an ode to the political choices made
by the union in the spirit of the founding father.

>Whereas in early days in the spinning department the worker used to handle two
sides of two hundred spindles each, now as per agreements with mills, in most
cases, he is expected to man four sides of four hundred spindles each. Sometimes,
rarely though, he is expected to look after six sides also. And thanks to loitering
which is rampant and relievers and rest intervals provided for by agreement, the
worker rarely works for more than four hours out of an eight hours day. It is
customary to oblige the loitering worker by looking after the workload he is
entrusted with. When, therefore, a neighbouring worker is playing truant, the
worker even deals with eight sides of four hundred spindles each. In the weaving
department, _de jure_ the worker handles four looms. Connivingly he spares
himself for six looms also. (Majmundar 1973: 231)

It will come as no surprise that the campaign for rationalization adopted
by many textile producers in the early 1960s was met with suspicion
among the workers. What stuck in their throats was the ease with which
the TLA leadership consented to the increased workload. Irritation
about corruption among the lower level of the union's staff --- the _pratinidhi_
was particularly notorious for this --- combined with growing resentment
about the closed negotiations with which their representatives agreed on
terms of employment with the employers. The members could do little
other than accept the outcome as a _fait accompli_. Work songs full of
sarcasm expressed the frustration felt by the workers. In the example
reproduced below, X has two meanings: being nominated as a candidate
for the municipal elections by the TLA and being made to operate more,
and more complicated, machines in the mill.

Majmundar was not only positive in his assessment of the value and
necessity of the rationalization carried out in the 1960s, he believed that
moderation in pay demands was in the employees' best interest. The
cost-of-living allowance and the bonus, to which the AMA had been
forced to consent by the unrest of the mid 1960s, threatened to affect the
profitability of the industry. He warned that the immediate benefits for
the workers would be overshadowed by negative effects in the longer
term. A staunch supporter of moderate union policies, Majmundar felt
higher pay, would lead to a massive loss of jobs as the result of increased
labour costs.

After completion of this study, I read a recently published article in
which Sujata Patel has commented on the Gandhian ideology as the
foundation of industrial relations in the textile industry of Ahmedabad
which became embedded in a corporatist framework. From the very
beginning the mill owners were divided on steering a course between
confrontation and accommodation but the majority of them grew
increasingly wary of the price they were asked to pay for adhering to the
policy of corporatism. Organized labour had even more reason to
reconsider the gains made from the historical deal which the leaders of
the main union had been so eager to strike with the industrialists. Patel
writes:

>Over time corporatism allowed for displacement, double work, re-employment
with lower wages, and in some cases, even the closure of mills. Corporatist
patronage made possible the capitalist incorporation and discipline of workers.
The long-term impact of corporatism was much more telling: by incorporating
the first collective effort to fashion an alternative modernity in the early 20th
century to the politics of the nation (which later came to mean the politics of the
Congress party), it pushed back the political growth of class-based alliances. The
growth of such class-based alliances would have created a repertoire of cultural
practices that would have, in turn, served as resources for the reformulation of
further political collectivities. It is unfortunate that these practices have been lost
as a result of the capitalist incorporation of the workers.

As will be described in the second part of this study, the decline of the
textile industry continued at an even faster rate from the end of the
1970s. Was this indeed the result of increased production costs caused by
unreasonable labour demands? This question will also be addressed in
detail. Before that, however, the last chapter of part I first takes stock of
the 'righteous struggle'. Did it lead to a better existence for the industrial
vanguard of the working population in Ahmedabad and what role did
the labour movement play in this?
