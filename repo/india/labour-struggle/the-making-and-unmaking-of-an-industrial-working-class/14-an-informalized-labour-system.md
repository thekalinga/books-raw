## An Informalized Labour System

### Informality not a Problem But a Solution

In the middle of the last century, the countries grouped as the 'Third
World' were expected to develop in the same way as the urban-industrial
societies in the Atlantic part of the world had done. In the early 1960s,
when I started my academic career with fieldwork in villages in India,
South Asia was described in the social science literature --- like most of the
'non-Western' world --- as a peasant society. This was based on the fact
that the majority of the population lived in rural areas and made a living
by tilling the land. In the past 40 years, as a result of diversification of the
economy, agriculture has lost much of its centuries-old dominance. The
declining importance of this primary sector of economic activity has
been accompanied by increasing mobility among the rural population to
destinations near and far. While migration to urban growth poles has
increased dramatically, there has been no concomitant expansion of
employment in high-tech enterprises and large-scale factories. Most
migrants are low skilled or unskilled and are hampered in their attempts
to settle in the cities by a shortage of permanent employment. The
haphazard nature of the work they do manage to find forces them to live
a nomadic existence. It is a pattern of mobility which stimulates them to
keep moving to different locations and sectors, and it is not exceptional
for them to return to their point of departure for shorter or longer
periods.

The continuing flow of labour from the rural hinterland to the cities,
without a related emergence of industrial production regimes that determined
the nature of social transformation in Western countries, makes it
easier to understand why there was no rapid and striking improvement
in terms and conditions of employment and in the quality of the
workers' lives. At the start of the 1970s, this led to the introduction of the
concept of the informal sector. My inaugural lecture delivered at the
Erasmus University in Rotterdam in 1976 was a critical essay of the way
in which the concept was operationalized (Breman 1976). The fact that
a large part of the working population remained excluded from employment
in the formal sector of the economy initially had no effect on the
belief in an evolutionary development process that would eventually lead
to the same socio-economic and socio-political structure as the one that
emerged in the Western part of the world. In this view, it was just a
question of time and the informal sector functioned as a kind of waiting
room in which newcomers to the urban milieu --- which is how these
workers were seen --- acquired the skills and experience required to secure
better paid and more highly valued work in large-scale companies and
modern factories.

A profusion of micro studies, mostly conducted by anthropologists,
have helped increase our understanding of the deprived existence of the
enormous army of working poor who eke out a living outside agriculture
and in the cities of the Third World. In many of these publications,
'informality' is understood in terms of employment and labour relations
in the lowest echelons of the economy. This is the position adopted here.
It concerns workers who do not have the security of a formal employment
contract, or the protection of measures imposed by legislation or of
collective action resulting from organization in trade unions. Since the
concept of informality was introduced, the focus has been on the lack of
regulation which gives much economic activity an extra-legal character.
The absence of registration is the result not only of insufficient reach on
the part of official bodies, but also of a desire not to subject these
activities to the restrictions of registration. Informal activities are therefore
often also illegal. Seen in this way, the employment of informal
labour has its origins in a desire to keep production, and the surplus it
generates, outside the confines of the formalized' order. The reverse is
also true: to remain outside official government records and statistics as
much as possible, the employment of labour must remain invisible. This
means that, far from being a specific feature of faulty and backward'
organizational structure, informality is an expression of the state's inability
to control capital and those who own it.

The government has long neglected the problems of informal labour
which, even if employment in agriculture is not included in the calculation,
accounts for more than 90% of the working population.
There are some tentative signs that this view may now be changing. The
report of the second National Commission on Labour calls the informal
poor the victims of invisibility. The recognition that they have been
invisible --- at least by those who did not want to acknowledge their
presence for so long --- should not, however, lead to the conclusion that
this has occurred unintentionally. The commission's report describes in
great detail the scale, composition, and dynamics of work in the informal
sector but notes that the picture is incomplete owing to the absence of
sufficient, reliable data (Main report 2002: 595).

In the past quarter of a century the number of people working in the
informal sector has greatly increased rather than decreased. This increase
means that the proportion of those working in informality has risen from
around half of the working population --- the conservative estimate in the
1970s --- to more than four-fifths in the decades that followed. A complex
of economic and social mechanisms have led to the progressive fall
in the number of people working in agriculture. The expulsion of labour
from this to other sectors of economic activity in both rural and urban
milieus has occurred on the basis of conditions which in other publications
I have summarized as perpetual mobility, casual rather than permanent
employment, and piecework rather than timework (_e.g._ Breman
1996 and 1999a and b). The initial assumption that the increasing
pressure on the lower echelons of the economy outside agriculture would
be relieved by rapid expansion of formal sector employment proved illfounded.
On the contrary, while the exodus from the agrarian sector
continues unabated, employment in the formal sector is being progressively
eroded. This latter trend, which points to informalization of
labour relations, is the main theme of my argument here.

Understanding the dynamic outlined above compels a reappraisal of
the received wisdom that the course of economic development in the
former colonial world is in essence a repetition --- albeit at a slower
pace --- of the process of industrialization and urbanization that laid the
foundations for the Western welfare state. A critical review of the former
notion of an evolutionary development process also has consequences for
policy. Lubell observes that the informal sector is not gradually shrinking
in size, but continues to grow. In his words, The Informal Sector is Here
to Stay (Lubell 1991: 111). Lubell does tend to overemphasize the
beneficial effects of this turnaround in the development process. The
World Bank has also emerged as an enthusiastic advocate of this new
interpretation. In the authoritative vision of this transnational institution
on economic policy, the informal sector is no longer the problem
but the solution to poverty. The security and protection which a small
proportion of the working population used to enjoy as a consequence of
permanent employment and the rights attached to it, were acquired on
the basis of collective action through organization in trade unions and
state support for this form of representation assured through legislation.
In the final decades of the twentieth century, the initial prevailing view
that this trajectory would lead to a gradual formalization of employment
has been radically challenged. It is increasingly replaced by a belief that
an 'aristocratic' segment of the working population has succeeded in
achieving for itself a position above that of the mass of the working poor,
which cuts across the free workings of supply and demand on the labour
market and presents an obstacle to the continued increase in production
and in profits from economic activity. Transnational institutions like the
World Bank and the IMF have played an important role in preaching
this new ideology, which should lead to increased economic growth.

The heavy pressure on the Indian government to open up the economy
to foreign capital has been accompanied by unremitting calls to restructure
the system of industrial relations. The subsequent policy moves in
this direction are increasing India's ties with the global system. It would,
however, be incorrect to attribute the restriction of the power of the trade
unions and the dismantling of a large number of statutory regulations
designed to protect labour only to pressure from transnational institutions,
the World Bank and the IMF in particular. Before the introduction
of the new policy towards the end of the 1980s, an economic regime
emerged in the western state of Gujarat which gave priority to the
informalization of both entrepreneurship and labour. This entailed the
removal of all kinds of institutional restrictions to promote the free
development of these forces of production. I have reported on the effects
of this capitalist development on the working population in the region
on several occasions, on the basis of my own empirical research (see
Breman 1994, 1996 and 2001). The change in principle and practice of
labour policy started in the 1970s, but the fact that it gathered pace in
later years had much to do with the failure of the great textile strike
which broke out in Bombay in 1982. This was as good as heralding the
end of the one and half centuries of history of this large-scale industry
and the social struggle that accompanied it. The closure of the composite
mills led to the transfer of the production of textiles, especially weaving,
to small-scale workshops, whose owners did not tolerate the intervention
of unions or governments (Roy 1998). A similar transition took place in
Ahmedabad, the largest city in Gujarat, which had grown to become the
Manchester of India in the course of the twentieth century.

### The End of Labour Market Dualism

The textile mill closures in Ahmedabad were a direct consequence of the
liberalization of industry and the economy at large. The textile policy
that came into force in 1985 was accompanied by the removal of
restrictions on the organization of production which had been introduced
in the first decades after Independence. The new economic policy
announced in 1991 represented a more systematic confirmation of this
pro-free market course by removing yet more restrictive government
regulations. One objective of these far-reaching reforms was to increase
the flexibility of the labour market. It is against this background that the
loss of about 125,000 jobs in the textile industry in Ahmedabad in the
last quarter of the twentieth century must be seen.

The argument for greater flexibility is based on the assumption that
security of employment, as a distinctive feature of the labour regime in
the formal sector of the economy, is counterproductive to the creation of
more work. A permanent job also implies a whole range of rights and
entitlements, such as a guaranteed wage index-linked to the price of basic
necessities, paid holidays, and a range of bonuses and contributions for
social provisions. As a consequence of these overhead expenditures,
labour accounts for a much higher percentage of production costs than
just wages. The change from a planned to a liberal market economy
marks the end of efforts to build up a social-democratic welfare state
along Western European lines and to protect labour with a system of
strict regulations under the watchful eye of the government. The turning
tide also entails curtailing the power of the trade unions in which the
vanguard of the labouring classes had united to defend their interests.
The political choice for an unadulterated capitalist development strategy
not tamed by state control means that employees can be hired and fired
according to the needs of the moment. And at a price which --- without
corrective intervention --- is determined by supply and demand. Such a
regime is seen as providing the best guarantee of sustained and employment-friendly
growth.

In the introduction I noted that transnational financial agencies
exerted considerable pressure on the government of India to effect this
turnabout in macroeconomic policy. The main argument for imposing
this change is that an extension of scale beyond the national level can
occur only through harmony with the principles on which, according to
the IMF and the World Bank, the dynamics of the global system depend:
free trade and competition as the determining characteristics of economic
activity. In its _World Development Report 1995_, the World Bank
claimed that accelerating economic growth required that the dualistic
structure of the labour market be abandoned without delay.[^14/1]

As stated earlier, a pattern of economic reform, along the lines
introduced for the country as a whole after 1991, had already been
pursued in Gujarat from the late 1960s onwards. The state government
declined to introduce or apply rules meant to promote the growth of the
workforce in the formal sector of the economy. I have published a series
of studies (see _e.g._ Breman 1977, 1985, 1994, 1996 and 1999a) based
on empirical research on the social impact of this policy of informalization.
The dominant practice of avoiding formal regulation by government
agencies in Gujarat explains why the industrial magnates in Ahmedabad
were able to count on an accommodating response from the authorities
when, one after the other, they started shutting down production in
composite textile mills. Their attempts to seek a higher return on the
capital they had invested, and to withdraw their capital from a regime of
production in which labour had steadily gained in value, met with little
official opposition. In the few cases where complaints were lodged
against companies for illegal termination of production, criminal proceedings
were usually not instigated owing to legal complications. Was it
in fact correct to assume that the closure of unprofitable textile mills
would inevitably lead to mass unemployment and impoverishment of
those who lost their jobs? Partly perhaps, at least in the short term. Yet
more optimistic prognoses claimed that the policy of informalization
that had been pursued in the state in the previous decades had resulted in
not less but more work and not more but less poverty.

[^14/1]: For a critical appraisal of this report, see Breman 1995.

The first steps towards dismantling labour legislation have meanwhile
been taken. The power of the trade union movement, which in 1989 had
still been able to prevent the adoption of the Industrial Relations Bill
(under which only companies with more than 300 employees would
need government permission to close down), has been considerably
weakened in the face of progressive economic liberalization. The main
point of conflict is abolition of the much contested employment security.
The argument is that the price of preserving this acquired right, which
benefits only a very small proportion of the working population, is far
too high: namely the inability to attract capital on a large scale or to
invest with any prospect of a reasonable return. In this connection, it is
worth recalling that one of the main union demands during the failed
textile strike in Mumbai, which lasted from the end of 1982 to the
middle of 1983, was to decasualize the large number of reserve workers
(_badli_) (Bhowmik 2000: 8--9).

Workers and their representatives are accused of abusing the protection
afforded to them to steadfastly resist all proposals that might lead to
greater flexibility. Behind this criticism is the desire to be able to dismiss
employees if results are below par or to rationalize business operations to
increase productivity, without being confronted with the impossibility
of getting rid of superfluous labour. It has been calculated that a
substantial part of the workforce in the formal sector could be made
redundant without affecting the level of production.

At the start of March 2001, presenting the budget for the new year,
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha announced radical changes to the
Industrial Disputes Act of 1947. He justified the changes by referring to
the rigidity of existing labour laws. His proposal was to allow companies
with fewer than 1,000 employees to close without prior permission from
the government. The announcement received a warm response from the
proponents of private enterprise. Although the proposed deregulation
also entails an increase in the compensation paid to redundant workers,
experience in Ahmedabad has shown that it is not too difficult to find
ways around this obligation. The trade unions have expressed sharp
criticism of these plans to dismantle industrial legislation and are taking
action to try and influence the debate on the changes in parliament. It is
certainly not a coincidence that the leadership of the organized labour
movement has taken a much less resolute stand against another initiative
which Minister Sinha announced in the same speech --- the repeal of the
Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act of 1970, which abolished
contract labour. This act was introduced to provide a minimum of
protection for workers in the informal sector, who are exposed to all
manners of exploitation of their labour power by contractors and subcontractors.
Yet the impact of the policy of flexibilization on this extremely
vulnerable group of workers --- who make up the lion's share of
the working population is --- likely to be much greater than that of the
amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act on the status of workers in
the formal sector. The fact that the government has never taken great
pains to ensure effective compliance with the legal restrictions on the use
of contract labour is small consolation. With these amendments, it no
longer even keeps up the pretence of doing so.

How plausible is the argument that it is necessary to weaken employment
security to restrict overprotection of formal sector labour? There is
a tendency to attribute this acquired right to the encouraging attitude
adopted by the post-colonial state in respect of this vanguard of the
emerging industrial society. According to this interpretation, labour
welfarism was promoted in the first decades following Independence to
secure employees' interests and to limit the power of private enterprise
through government control of the economic order. Yet this view can be
contradicted by the argument that it was the employers who insisted on
job security in the first instance, to ensure that their employees complied
with their employment contracts. The Workmen's Breach of Contract
Act of 1859 can be seen as an early expression of this desire to tie
employees to a contractual obligation. The colonial government ruled
that refusal to work would be regarded a cognizable offence to be
punished with detention for three months (Karnik 1967: 25). The initial
reluctance of the masses of migrant workers from the rural hinterland to
bind themselves unconditionally to the rhythm of industrial labour gave
rise to complaints from employers in later years about the lack of
commitment of their workforces. When the expulsion of labour from
the agricultural sector and from the villages increased dramatically
during the first half of the twentieth century, it was the turn of the
labourers to realize the benefits of a permanent job. At the same time,
employers increasingly experienced job security as a burden. Their earlier
complaint about the lack of commitment was turned around and interpreted
by them as a problem of overcommitment on the part of their
employees (Breman 1999a: 4--17). Industrialists now responded angrily
to the workers' inclination to treat their jobs as more or less their own
property. This even extended to them claiming the right to designate a
son or other close family member as the primary candidate to take over
their position when they reached the end of their working life.

The World Bank in particular has been a fervent supporter of a policy
aimed at ending the dualism in the labour market, not by formalizing
but by informalizing the employer-employee relationship. The argument
for abolition of 'onerous job security regulations' and other labour
laws, such as establishing a minimum wage, which hamper the free
workings of supply and demand has now acquired the status of political
correctness, against which few dare to object. In a ILO Social Policy
lecture, Bardhan also joined the ranks of those who believe that the
tendency in India to consider a permanent job as one's own property is
not only counterproductive in terms of efficiency and effectiveness but
also does no justice to the interests of excluded candidates who might be
better qualified (Bardhan 2001: 471--2).[^14/2]

The South Asian regional office of the ILO in Delhi recognizes the
rationale for abolishing employment security but notes that the refusal of
workers to consent to such measures is also understandable. Their
determined resistance against erosion of their status as employees is
driven by the lack of any system of provisions to alleviate the consequences
of involuntary unemployment and to offer them decent labour
standards, albeit at a lower level of subsistence. These comments led to a
recommendation in a recent ILO report that the reforms aimed at
abolishing the dualism in the labour market should include a social
safety net and the establishment of a minimum wage to ensure an
income above the poverty line (ILO Report 1996; see further Ghose 1999).

The motivation for introducing a national minimum wage is to
provide all those who take part in the labour process with socio-economic
security. In practice, such guarantees have existed in many branches
of industry in the informal sector for years. No doubt Gandhi's historical
plea for payment of a living wage inspired the introduction of these
ordinances. It is, however, not clear exactly how high this minimum
should be. It is most certainly below the standard of a _fair_ wage, which
does exist in the formal sector and is periodically adjusted on the basis of
collective bargaining. In determining the total wage of this protected
labour, a whole range of provisions are taken into account which have
acquired the status of rights over the passage of time, such as a dearness
allowance and an annual bonus. The norm applied for a _poverty line_ wage
is based on an eight-hour working day, 26 working days a month; the
rate is calculated on the basis of an amount reasonably required to enable
the worker and two dependent household members to fulfil their basic
needs. An author who surveyed these government interventions over
time adds that 'the statutory minimum wage rates notified in many states
for unorganized industries have almost always been below the poverty
line wage, i.e. the wage which should enable a worker and his family of
non-earning dependents to cross the poverty line.' (Bhagat 1997: 724).

[^14/2]: To improve the lot of informal sector workers, Bardhan proposes introducing wage
subsidies, financed through a tax on consumption, which would encourage employers to
take on more workers. I find this proposal lacking in both economic plausibility and
political feasibility.


The concept of a minimum wage was introduced to reduce the
vulnerability of labour. But it is applied with a great deal of caution.
There is no precise answer to the question what basic needs actually
entail, in both a qualitative and a quantitative sense. Opinions vary
widely on exactly what should be considered the minimum standard of
living for a worker at the bottom end of the economy. As we shall see
later, the actual calculated amount not only comes close to the poverty
line, it even falls below it. The problem is not only that periodical reviews
of the amount tend to lag behind the rising prices of daily necessities, but
also that there is, by and large, no effective supervision on the part of the
government to ensure that employers comply with their obligation to
pay the minimum wage.

The existence of legislation guaranteeing a minimum wage for workers
in the informal sector since 1948 has been unable to prevent an
enormous fall in the income of textile workers who lost their jobs in the
mills. As I have already explained in an earlier chapter, the social safety
net introduced to support the sacked workers turned out to be a
complete failure for most of them. The National Renewal Fund, set up
in 1992 by the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR),
may have led to a number of the closed mills being transferred to the
public sector, but very little came of the rationalization of operations that
was intended as the next step. The workers employed by the National
Textile Corporation or the Gujarat State Textile Corporation were often
paid without having to work. It was in fact a transitional scheme that
usually led to voluntary redundancies. The termination of their employment
contract was offset by the pledge that all their accumulated rights
(such as the provident fund and other payments) would be honoured
and they would receive the statutory redundancy pay. The majority of
the sacked mill workers were, however, unable to benefit from this
relatively favourable redundancy scheme because, for reasons they failed
to understand, their mills closed before being recognized as a 'sick
industry'.

The lion's share of the money allocated to the NRF was used to
finance voluntary redundancies. The higher-ranking personnel of the
closed mills benefited disproportionately from this scheme. In contrast
to the golden handshakes received by the managers and other white-collar
staff members, the workforce at the bottom of the mill hierarchy
were fobbed off with the lowest of compensation payments. Redundancy
payments accounted for such a large percentage of the funds available
that very little or nothing was left over to finance the two other components
of the social safety net --- the generation of replacement jobs and
the retraining of sacked workers. The plan to set up small-scale cooperatives
on the sites of the closed mills using the revenue from the sale of the
material assets of the bankrupt mills as seed capital was never given
serious thought. Progressive liberalization at both the national and the
state level excluded the possibility of any form of government support for
such initiatives.

The experience of former workers with short-term retraining courses ---
almost always discouraging --- has already been discussed. The limited
duration and low quality of the courses, the lack of money or credit to
buy the necessary tools and equipment to perform the skills learned, and
lack of support of any kind in finding a new job were the main reasons
why so few of the former mill workers started or completed this training.
The extremely low budget allocated to the programme showed that,
although the pledge to provide retraining gave the impression of being
well-thought-out and well-intentioned, it was in fact neither (see _e.g._
Srinavasan 1999: 1873--76).

One aspect to which I would like to draw special attention is that the
policy of rehabilitating workers made redundant as the consequence of
closures in the formal sector of the economy was based on the firm belief
that they would inevitably have to seek alternative employment in the
informal sector. The focus in the retraining programmes was on selfemployment,
on the assumption that as micro-entrepreneurs they would
stand the best chance of returning to the labour process.

My criticism of attempts to compensate for the negative effects of the
process of informalization finds support in various reports on this issue
(see Hirway 1995: 185--200 and Hirway and Mahadevia 2000: 50--51
and elsewhere). That the developments in Gujarat are by no means
exceptional can be seen from studies relating to the results of the NRF
throughout the country (see ILO Report 1996: 95--105 and Sharma and
Mamgain 2001: 270--271). The meagre success of the NRF is attributed
not only to the fact that the activities carried out fell well short of
meeting the needs of the sacked workers, but also to the lack of experience
of the agencies involved. In my view, this interpretation underestimates
the systematic absence of political will to help the victims of the
informalization process both during and after the closures, in a way that
could have increased their resilience in surviving this dramatic downturn
in their fortunes.

### The Eclipse of a 'Labour Aristocracy'

My study of the situation in which the sacked mill workers find themselves
has to be understood in the light of the dynamics of employment
and income for the working population of Ahmedabad as a whole. With
the exception of a small minority --- mostly those who held higher skilled
and better-paid technical or administrative jobs --- the dismissed factory
workers sought alternative employment in a wide variety of occupations
in the informal sector. Of this massive number with a permanent labour
contract, in my estimate approximately 85,000 --- around one tenth ---
would have left the city to try and build a new life elsewhere, often in the
towns or villages from which they or their parents originally came. The
downward mobility of the greater part of this army of unemployed
workers led to a further expansion of the pool of reserve labour already
existing in the lower echelons of the city economy. This was entirely in
accordance with Lubell's description of the informal sector as a sponge
which absorbs the unemployed for whom there is no place in the formal
sector. Lubell, however, believed that this incorporation of otherwise
unemployed labour would have a beneficial effect, also for reducing
income disparities between the two sectors (Lubell 1991: 11).

Before the mill closures in the city started to gather momentum a
quarter of a century ago, the factory hands who enjoyed secure employment
accounted for two-thirds to three-quarters of the formal sector
workforce. The retrenchment of what was once an industrial vanguard
has resulted in a dramatic fall in the relative size and importance of this
protected and organized segment. As the total size of the working
population of Ahmedabad has grown --- less the consequence of natural
expansion and immigration than of extension of the municipal boundaries
--- the proportion of work performed in the informal sector has also
increased. In the early 1970s, the informal sector was estimated to
account for around half of all paid work in the urban economy (see _e.g._
Papola 1986: 26--29). By the end of the century, this had grown to
between three-quarters and four-fifths. It is an estimate which depends
on how informal sector work is defined. In my study this is understood
as wage labour or work on one's own account which generates income
but which is not regulated by an explicit employment contract (written
or oral) stipulating mutual rights and obligations if only approximately,
enjoys no protection, cannot insist on fair labour standards, and --- in the
majority of cases --- is not registered (or only partially) in the official
records. This definition embraces not only the huge army of those who
work in the street or in their own homes, but also the industrial workers
employed in small-scale enterprises like diamond ateliers, powerloom
workshops, and other manufacturing establishments with low capital
intensity and widely fluctuating production capacity. Informal sector
earners work where, when, and as long as employers or (sub)contractors
require them and are not in a position to demand the legal minimum
wage or other provisions, even if such have been agreed within the
particular sector in which they are put to work. Lastly, and partly
resulting from the above, they are not registered anywhere. The fact that
they are barely visible or completely invisible to observers based in the
'formal' economy explains why occupational and employment statistics
must be seen as approximations rather than as exact or even fairly
accurate data.

My definition of informal work is based on the nature of the employment
relationship rather than the economic activity itself. Business firms
may be subject to industrial legislation or comply with other criteria
relating to the formal sector. But the nature of the agreement with their
employees is informal, in the sense that the latter are not employed on a
permanent --- or even a regular --- basis and as such do not appear in the
account books. They work on the basis of a mostly oral contract agreed
for an unspecified period of time with a jobber or (sub)contractor, who
reserves the right to terminate the arrangement at any time. The only
obligation with respect to the workers is to pay them a piece rate. This
comes with no entitlements to social security or other similar provisions.
Many of the textile barons in Ahmedabad ignored the labour legislation,
compliance with which would have increased their costs, long before
they closed the composite mills. They replaced permanent employees in
certain stages of the production process with much cheaper casual
workers, hired by internal or external brokers for as long as they were
needed. This is a form of disguised informalization of work in the formal
sector. When workers employed in this way are included in the calculation,
the proportion of those working under informal sector conditions
rises to above 90% of the economically active population in
Ahmedabad (Unni 2000: 60).[^14/3] This estimate is in line with the figure of
92%, accepted by the National Commission on Labour for the
magnitude of this workforce in the country at large (Main Report, vol. I,
2002: 738). This policy document adds that two thirds of national
income is generated in the unorganized sector of the economy.

Publications that highlight the virtues of economic informality deny
that the move from the formal to the informal sector automatically
means a deterioration in living standards. This is particularly true of
arguments based on the belief that working on one's own account and at
one's own risk is the only assured way to achieve development. Such
considerations invariably sing the praises of micro-enterprise. Lubell
summarizes his overview of the literature as follows:

> ... ILO and other informal sector surveys showed that many informal sector
participants who had worked in the formal sector before going into the informal
sector shifted to the informal sector not because they were redundant to the
formal sector but because they chose to be self-employed, using skills acquired in
the formal sector to establish themselves as independent producers or traders;
they were small-scale entrepreneurs who chose self-employment because they
could capitalise on skills (and savings) acquired in the formal sector. (Lubell
1991: 112)

[^14/3]: In a recent publication, Unni distinguishes between these two processes of
informalization in the same way: '... informalisation takes place broadly in two ways.
Work is pushed out of the factories and formal work situations into small workshops
(sweatshops), the homes and informal situations. That is, there is an international trend in
subcontracting of work and a consequent increase in informal work, often in homeworking.
Secondly, the workers who remain in the factories or in formal work situations are
governed by looser contracts and obtain fewer social security benefits. That is, there is an
attempt on the part of the employer to reduce his liabilities.' (Unni 2001a: 2361)


The voluntary move from formal to informal sector implied by this
quotation is an option that was resorted to by few if any of the former
mill workers in Ahmedabad. As I have explained earlier, it was not a
matter of choice for them, but forced, downward mobility. At the time
of their dismissal they were already well aware of the fact that the job loss
would inevitably lead to a very drastic deterioration in their livelihood.
Does the simple fact that the majority of the working population never
knew better times make this dramatic turn for the worse somehow easier
to bear? Everyone knows, either from their own experience or from
hearsay, that work in the informal sector is irregular and usually earns
less. But this is where the difference lies. Superfluous labour expelled
from their jobs in the formal sector tend to lack the resilience and
survival skills which constitute the social capital of those more accustomed
to life at the bottom of the economy. Those who have had to work
and live in that precarious situation all their lives are socialized in these
aptitudes right from their engagement at a young age in the labour
process. Informal sector workers have a number of other typical characteristics
such as endless flexibility in the sense of being prepared to
perform a wide variety of tasks, by working irregular and if necessary also
longer hours, or the deference not to give offence by insisting on rights
and making demands.

In social-historical literature, organized industrial labour in modern
factories is seen as a vanguard of the working class. With the passage of
time, however, this proud reputation has made way for a very different
qualification which places the emphasis on the elitist conduct of this
privileged group. The term labour aristocracy was conventionally understood
to refer mainly to white-collar jobs and all those employed by
multinational companies. Later, the notion acquired a wider meaning
and all formal sector workers came to be seen as a closed caste which acts
like an aristocracy, seeking protection in collective action and aiming
only to further its own parochial interests. In doing so, its spokesmen
tended to ignore the much larger group of working people who have no
access to trade unions and are excluded from the social safety net
associated with secure and permanent employment. In the earlier chapters
of this monograph I have argued that the conditions in the textile mills
in Ahmedabad and the income enjoyed by the mill workers in no way
testified to an aristocratic lifestyle. Nevertheless, employment on a
permanent basis provided the regularity, stability, and dignity that accompany
work in the formal sector of the economy. What was long seen
as a logical and attractive model to emulate is, however, increasingly
interpreted in negative terms, as an unjust form of preferential treatment
consolidated through self-centred social action resulting in a better way
of life for a tiny part of the working class, hardly 8% of the
working population of India as a whole.

What used to be considered a vanguard, against the background of a
trend towards economic and more general social emancipation of people
who mostly own little more than their labour power, has increasingly
acquired a negative connotation and is now seen as a parasitical force
which unjustly provides protection for labour in the formal sector.
Abolition of that preferential treatment is called for not only on grounds
of social justice but also to remove an obstacle to the acceleration of
economic growth. It would definitely be incorrect to attribute this
change in the political climate and the economic policy that underlies it
unilaterally to the impact of the process of globalization. By far the
majority of the working population in south Asia has always been
excluded from the protection provided by labour legislation introduced
during the gradual transition to an industrial-urban society. But what is
difficult to deny is that, partly under pressure from transnational agencies
that operate on the basis of the hegemony of capital over other
factors of production, the earlier pledge to improve the quality of
working life step-by-step through public regulation and protection has
been abandoned. The recent social history of the state of Gujarat shows
that what was intended to be a gradual process of formalization of
employment emerged long before the ideology of globalization started to
determine the shape and direction of economic policy. The expulsion of
the industrial vanguard in Ahmedabad from its position of economic
security can be seen as the logical consequence of first, the abandonment
and then the reversal of this process. The alternative policy, which never
stood a chance in the political landscape of West India, would have been
to give priority to improving the onerous conditions of employment' in
the informal sector of the economy.

### Fact and Fancy on the State of Urban Poverty

The sombre picture which my analysis describes would, however, have to
be revised if the strategy of informalization proved to have led to more
work and less poverty in the urban economy of Ahmedabad. And this is
indeed the conclusion of various macroeconomic studies. This hopeful
message is backed up with figures which show that industrial growth in
Gujarat is far above the national average and that the state has been very
successful in attracting new capital. The high level of investment is
closely linked to what is suggestively portrayed as 'conducive industrial
relations'. According to this school of thought the policy of liberalization
has had an extremely favourable impact on development in recent
decades. The direct result can be seen in the considerable rise in real
income per capita in the final decade of the twentieth century. It is
therefore not surprising that these voices urge the government to continue
resolutely on its chosen course:

>Gujarat is bound to gain from the free movement of labour and capital and must
not do anything that would jeopardise continued free movement of the factors of
production. (Visaria 1998: 29; for similar opinions, _see also_ Awasthi 2000:
3183--92; Dholakia: 3121--24)

The optimistic view that emerges from these prognoses, most of
which come from economists, is supported by the argument that the
labour market has suffered no ill effects from the liberalization policy
introduced in 1991.

On the basis of the results of the 50th survey round (1993--1994) of
the National Sample Survey Organisation, Deshpande and Deshpande (1998) conclude that the feared fall in real wages and/or increase in
unemployment did not occur. On the contrary the figures they present
indicate, compared to the situation before the introduction of the new
policy, a substantial growth in employment (albeit more casual than
regular in nature), a rise in the level of real wages, greater participation of
both men and women in the labour process and, as a consequence of all
these trends, a striking fall in urban poverty. Gujarat's relatively good
track record in reducing poverty is confirmed by other publications. In
their Human Development Report 1999, Hirway and Mahadevia note
that the incidence of poverty in the state fell by half between 1972--73
and 1993--94. They add that, after an initial rise in the number of poor
in the cities between 1977--78 and 1987--88 (which they attribute to the
collapse of the textile industry and the transition to informal employment),
there was an economic recovery up to 1993--94 that resulted in a
32% decrease in the incidence of urban poverty (Hirway and
Mahadevia 2000: 52--54). These authors, too, point to a slight expansion
of the population at work in this last period and a percentage of
unemployment that was much lower than elsewhere in India. Yet their
study shows that, in absolute terms, poverty in Gujarat has decreased
much less dramatically, by 23% between 1973--74 and 1993--94,
while during the same period the number of urban poor has actually
increased slightly.

How has employment creation fared in Ahmedabad city? Here, too,
opinions vary widely depending on the starting point of the analysis in
question. As I stated earlier, the mill closures took place at a time when
there was no general crisis in the city's economy. The decline of the largescale
textile industry, which had been so crucial to the growth of
employment in Ahmedabad in the past, was offset by the more recent
arrival of high-tech pharmaceutical, petrochemical, and cement enterprises
and the emergence of a large number of small-scale powerloom
textile units, diamond cutting-cum-polishing workshops, and garment
ateliers. Most of these establishments are located in industrial zones on
the eastern periphery of the city, in a broad belt that lies (or lay until
recently) outside the municipal boundaries. It is here that the majority of
the migrants from the rural hinterland have settled. They are largely
unmarried men who, as fresh but unskilled labourers easily find jobs in
the small manufacturing workshops. The older industrial districts closer
to the city centre --- never an attractive sight when the chimneys were
belching smoke at all hours of the day and night --- are now in an
advanced state of decay. More and more people are leaving these rundown
neighbourhoods in search of work and even cheaper living accommodation
elsewhere in the city. This exodus is driven not only by
economic considerations, but also by a process of residential segregation
which is exposing the Muslim minority in particular to expulsion to the
slums on the other side of the river (Breman 1999b).

These changes in the spatial contours of the city have been accompanied
by a shift in the composition of the urban economy. Since the
1980s, the secondary sector has steadily lost ground and the tertiary
sector has grown rapidly. Trading enterprises, public and private banks,
insurance offices and other financial institutions, professional service
providers, institutes of higher education, internet cafes and other establishments
active in the new information technology dominate the business
districts that are rising from the ground on the west bank at a rapid
pace. Here, too, are the shopping malls, leisure centres, beauty saloons
and health clubs, that meet the demand among the newly prosperous
middle classes for daily necessities and consumer durables. These expanding
social classes populate the high-rise apartment blocks and lowrise
bungalow parks that now dominate the architecture of this part of
the city together with the network of wide streets meant for driving along
by car. The members of the lower income classes are mainly visible in
these opulent neighbourhoods as regular or ambulant domestic servants,
street vendors, repair and odd-job men, cleaners, day or night guards, or
other occupations that demonstrate servitude, the sole purpose of their
presence being to further the comfortable lifestyle of the well-to-do.

Located at one end of the Golden Corridor --- the belt of economic
activity and prosperity that stretches from Ahmedabad, across the railway
line and the national highway, via Vadodara and Surat all the way to
Mumbai --- the city is intent on keeping its reputation as the leading
growth pole in western India. The closure of dozens of composite textile
companies in the last two decades of the twentieth century could have
threatened this reputation, but the city found a suitable response in the
resolute prioritization of its capitalist development strategy. The choice
in favour of these dynamics has had major consequences for the character
of municipal government. While in the preceding decades the emphasis
was on building up a physical and institutional infrastructure for the
population of the city at large, this policy has been replaced by one
favouring the already privileged classes by designing schemes of urban
beautification which not merely bypass slum dwellers but are also
detrimental to their interests. This huge segment, close to half of the
city's population, does not fit in with the upgraded 'public space' and is
restricted from access to it.

>In fact, everyone in the executive as well as in the legislative have been enamoured
and taken-up by the new gadgetry, such as computers, cell phones, new models
of cars, etc. to be worried about the business of governing. The elected representatives
are even unaware of the processes of budget making let alone understanding
the implications of debt-finances. In such a scenario, both the elected and the
bureaucratic wings consider schemes such as making a company for riverfront
development or resurfacing and widening of roads, building of bridges and
flyovers as important achievement, rather than ensuring that adequate and safe
drinking water is available to all. (Mahadevia 2002: 129)

Those who praise informalization as the solution for unemployment
tend to overlook the fact that it is not only founded on a desire to
minimize the costs of production. Of only slightly less importance is the
fact that it also offers the possibility of evading taxes and other tributes
imposed by the government. In that sense, there is a process of
informalization that extends to the economy as a whole and entails
freeing capital from the constraints of regulation. In response to the
refusal of companies to pay tax on the surplus value added to their
commodities in the labour process, the government of Gujarat simply
scrapped or dramatically reduced the levies (Breman 1996: 182--3; Unni
and Bali 2001: 28--29). Thanks to the policy of liberalization that has
been pursued since as far back as the 1970s, Gujarat is one of the fastest
growing states in India. It has achieved this distinction on the basis of a
development scenario described by its proponents as a combination of
dynamic entrepreneurship, a government with the political will to give
the private sector a free rein, and what is seen by vested interests as a
favourable labour climate. These praises tend to ignore the disastrous
impact of this strategy on the environment. Air and water pollution have
reached disturbing levels in the industrial zones of the city, the effects of
which are expressed in the rising morbidity of the people who live and
work in them.

But what consequence does this political and economic choice have
on the demand for labour and the level of wages? An undeniably positive
one, if we are to believe supporters of the policy. An initial reservation
regarding this conclusion is that the flow of migrants to the largest city in
the state has slowed down since 1971. This is particularly remarkable
when compared to other urban centres in Gujarat (especially Surat and
Rajkot), where the influx has continued unabated (Mahadevia 2002:41).
With 3.3 million inhabitants in 1991, Ahmedabad has dropped down
the list of mega-cities in India and is now ranked seventh. According to
Mahadevia and D'Costa, the expansion of the municipal boundaries ---
the city doubled in physical size in 1986 --- has had a greater impact on
the population growth than the arrival of newcomers. They deduce from
this relatively backward position in the accelerated process of urbanization
currently taking place in Gujarat as a whole that Ahmedabad is of
declining importance in the economy of the state (Mahadevia and
D'Costa 1997: 15). It would on the other hand be going too far to
explain the modest demographic increase as signalling the flight of a
considerable segment of the working population from the city. There
would, after all, be no reason for this at all if we are to have any faith in
the reports that informalization of the labour market --- as an inherent
aspect of the policy of liberalization --- has generated more rather than
less work. Is there any hard evidence for this? The classical argument is
that economic growth creates more jobs and is therefore the best, if not
the only, guaranteed way of reducing poverty.

This approach, on which the structural adjustment programme (SAP)
embarked upon by India in 1991 was based, would indeed have had the
intended effect in the specific case of Ahmedabad. Dutta and Batley
claim, on the strength of statistics from the 50th round of the National
Sample Survey Organisation (1993--94), to be able to demonstrate the
success of the 'trickle-down' doctrine. Restricting themselves to figures
relating to the urban economy, the authors identify a slight increase in
the working population, from 29% in 1987--88 to 32% in
1993--94. This increase is accounted for almost entirely by women. In
itself an encouraging indication of the growth in total employment, in
their assessment at least, it is underlined by a low percentage of unemployed
and a similarly encouraging fall in underemployment (measured
in terms of the difference between weekly and daily employment status).
The shift in the metropolitan economy precipitated by the collapse of
the textile industry may have led to a different sectoral distribution of
jobs but in their view has had little effect on the overall magnitude of
employment. According to the same authors, the number of people
working on their own account and at their own risk remained more or
less constant. A much more striking finding reported by them is a
significant fall in the percentage of men working as casual labourers and
an equal growth in the percentage of regular male workers. The picture
their databases present of a strong improvement in the employment
situation is reinforced by the statement that the real wages of casual
labourers also went up during this period. It is therefore not surprising
that the authors conclude that, as a result of the policy of informalization,
poverty in Ahmedabad declined in both scale and intensity between
1987--88 and 1993--94 (Dutta and Batley 1999: 24--26; Dutta 2002:244).
In support of their argument, the authors use figures on the change in
income distribution in the city. These statistical data, collected by the
National Council of Applied Economic Research on the basis of regular
surveys of households, reveal that the percentage of the population with
the lowest annual income (less than ₹25,000) decreased rapidly from
more than a third in 1985--86 to less than a tenth in 1996--97. To
emphasize this great leap forward even more, Dutta and Batley add that
the income level they apply as a minimum is more than twice as high as
the official poverty line (_idem_: 22--24). An encouraging secondary development
is the decrease in income inequality, caused by the fact that
poverty in the lower echelons of the city economy has declined more
quickly than the rise of prosperity among the Ahmedabad elite. At least,
this is what we are led to believe.

I cannot refrain from taking a critical view on this line of thought.
Despite the forceful manner in which the authors create the impression
that the reform operation was a success in all respects after 1991, this
contrasts with another part of the report in which they state that
between 1981 and 1996--97 the percentage of the people living in slum
areas almost doubled, from 23 to 41% (_idem_: 39--42). To
attribute this deterioration solely to stagnation in the provision of
municipal services, such as water supply and a sewage system, or to bad
maintenance of these services, suggests a contrast between the public
deprivation and the private well-being of the residents of these
neighbourhoods. Such a conclusion, in my view, would be an unacceptable
distortion of reality.

Kundu, who makes explicit mention of the disastrous impact of the
mass dismissal of textile workers in Ahmedabad, nevertheless concludes
that the local economy retained its resilience. Using the same statistics,
this author interprets the rise in the percentage of men in the working
population of the city from 50% in 1981 to 56% in 1991
as a sign of recovery and growth in employment. He is also inclined to see
the increasing proportion of workers in regular work as proof that the
feared casualization of labour did not happen. Against all expectations,
says Kundu, there is no hard evidence of a continuing trend towards
informalization of employment. Even if the poverty index is lowered to
a household income of ₹18,000 a year, a much smaller percentage of
the population of Ahmedabad falls below this line than in other cities in
Gujarat (Kundu 2000: 3172--82). In short, according to these reports,
the debacle in large-scale industry in the city was followed, in the final
decade of the last century, by the emergence of new forms of economic
activity which particularly benefited the lower income classes. But is this
a plausible report on the trend in the urban economy?

### Stuck at the Bottom of the Urban Economy

This whole account of a growing demand for labour and declining
poverty is completely at odds with the results of my own case study of the
dismissed textile workers in Ahmedabad. The majority of them ended up
in the informal sector of the economy. These 'new poor' have come to
join the already enormous army of workers who have never known a
different kind of life. How many people actually suffered a genuine
deterioration in the quality of life? Various publications come up with
different figures for the number of mill workers who had secure jobs and
lost them. My own estimate is that this happened to approximately
85,000 regular workers who were sacked from the late 1970s onwards. In
the decade before the mill closures the management of these enterprises
had already managed to reduce the size of the workforce in permanent
employ. Labourers who reached the age of retirement were not replaced
at all or at best by casual hands who never qualified for full protection by
industrial legislation. Some tasks in the process of production were also
contracted out to jobbers who had to bring their own work gangs, which
remained unregistered in the factory records. Of the estimated total of
85,000 with regular contracts who were dismissed during the last two
decades of the twentieth century, somewhat more than ten % may
have left the city after being made redundant. Wherever they went,
usually back to their place of origin, only in rare cases did these drop-outs
succeed in getting access to similar jobs in the formal sector of the
economy. Their future was as dark as for the large majority who decided
to stay on in Ahmedabad. Another ten % --- most of them belonging
to the technical or administrative staff in the mills --- were able to find
jobs of more or less equal income and skill. Apart from this small
segment, which somehow endeavoured to consolidate their formal sector
status, all the others --- according to my calculations not less than 75,000
workers --- were eased out into the informal sector, a transfer which
implied a dramatic downturn in their fortunes. Without doubt, the scale
of redundancies in the same sector was of an even greater magnitude in
Mumbai. Bhowmik has calculated that of the 250,000 workers employed
in the textile mills a quarter of a century ago, at least 170,000
have since been dismissed (Bhowmik 2000). But although far more
people lost their jobs in Mumbai as a result of the far-reaching streamlining
of the industry that followed the long textile strike in 1982--- , they
accounted for a much smaller percentage of the total working population
than their counterparts in Ahmedabad.

If we take the composition of the household as the basis for determining
the impact of what in official jargon is called 'downsizing' of the
workforce employed in the textile industry in Ahmedabad, we can say
that on a conservative estimate at least 300,000 people --- the workers
themselves together with the members of their households --- were directly
affected by the negative consequences of the dismissal of the major
breadwinner from the secure jobs they held in the textile mills. And in
addition to these principal victims there were others as well. In the first
place, all reserve (_badli_) workers, approximately 35,000, were laid off
straight away. Also approximately 15,000 contract workers lost their
employment, as well as the non-factorized labourers consisting of men
and women who used to manufacture bobbins or processed the waste
material they bought from suppliers belonging to the lower mill management.
Finally, petty trade, services and transport in the mill localities
suffered from the drastic loss of income of the mill households which
made up a major part of their customers. With the total population of
the urban conurbation of Ahmedabad rising from 2.5 million in 1981 to
3.3 million in 1991, the mill closures directly affected to a greater or
lesser extent around 125,000 households or at least one fifth of the city's
inhabitants, a significant proportion. And even that was not the end of
the story of impoverishment. As a result of the influx of households
expelled from the formal sector, the already fragile existence of workers
in the informal sector came under even greater pressure than before.
From the accounts of my informants it is clear that competition for work
has led to much tension and conflict both in residential areas as well as at
work sites.

The former mill workers have been forced to engage in this fierce
struggle to survive at the bottom of the urban economy. They have been
deprived of the security in their work and their lives, which formerly
distinguished them from the reserve army stuck at the bottom of the
economy with a much less stable way of life and lower standard of living.
For some of the new poor, particularly the older among them, bridging
this gap was too great a step and they have not re-entered the labour
market at a lower level. This accounts for the high percentage of respondents
in our survey --- more than a quarter of the total --- who can no
longer be considered economically active. Although many of them ---
almost all are men --- work every now and again when the opportunity
presents itself, they do not make much of an effort to seek work for
themselves. This they leave to other (younger and fitter) members of the
household.

The remaining three-quarters who cannot afford to opt out of the
obligation to provide for themselves and the dependent members of their
households fall into two groups of roughly the same size: those who work
on their own account and at their own risk, and those who work as casual
or regular wage labourers. I have remarked earlier that these are not hard
and fast dividing lines. In each group there is a core of workers who do
not change their occupation or their mode of employment very frequently.
But on the periphery, the transition is more fluid and is
characterized by greater mobility on a seasonal or even daily basis. This
circulation also means that there are substantial differences between
what is reported as the average wage level in the various segments of the
labour market. It is necessary to make this reservation, even though
fluctuations in the incomes of self-employed workers and casual or
regular wage labourers tend to be limited in scale. The variations rarely
exceed ten to fifteen rupees a day.

The data I collected myself together with B.B. Patel --- a survey of 600
households in 1998, the results of which I explored further during
anthropological fieldwork based on 60 households in 1999 and early
2000 --- revealed that the income of ex-mill workers who had found work
elsewhere ranged from 900 to 1,200 rupees a month, about half or even
only one-third of their former earnings. Income from a day's work
averaged 45--50 rupees, with certain occupations earning up to 20--30% more (_e.g._ rickshaw drivers) or less (_e.g._ waste collectors). Since
other studies relating to this period mention similar figures I assume that
the reported findings are more or less representative of the income level
of the majority of informal-sector workers in the city shortly before the
turn of the century. While my own survey was restricted to the households
of workers who had lost their mill jobs, Unni focused in 1998--99
on the dynamics of employment and wages in the lowest economic
echelons in Ahmedabad. Her survey of 758 informal-sector households
throughout the city showed that the average daily wage for men was 47
rupees, while women generally earned less than 37 rupees (Unni 2000:
50, table 6.1).

How do these rates compare to those laid down in the statutory
regulations governing a wide variety of major occupations in the informal
sector? Over the years the Gujarat government has established a
minimum wage in 53 branches of employment in the informal sector.
From the overview of occupations practised by her respondents Unni
concludes that nearly half fall under this protective regime. According to
the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers this rate varied between
45 and 53 rupees in 1998. However, the majority of these
workers, especially the women, earned less than they were entitled to. As
early as the mid-1980s, Patel observed that the income of the sacked mill
workers was below the level of the statutory minimum wage (Patel 1988:
44--5). Nevertheless, in the years since, officials of the Labour Inspectorate
have made no effort at all to put an end to this underpayment.

The discrepancy between what, according to the government, is the
minimum required income to survive and the actual income from paid
work does not sufficiently reveal the extent to which people are unable to
meet their basic needs. This also becomes apparent when the poverty line
wage concept is taken into consideration. A panel of experts calculated
that in Gujarat in 1998 a daily wage of 52 rupees would be sufficient, on
the basis of an eight-hour working day and 26 working days a month, for
an informal sector worker with two dependents to survive above the
poverty line. The majority of my informants, however, remained well
below (10--40%) the monthly income of 1,350 rupees that this
amounted to. Firstly because they often earned much less than 52 rupees
a day and secondly because a 26-day working month was more the
exception than the rule. The shortfall applied not only to own-account
workers and casual day labourers, but also to employees holding a regular
job. Kundu concluded from the rise in the percentage of regular waged
workers in Ahmedabad between 1987--88 and 1993--94, reported by the
NSS, that the feared trend towards the informalization of labour in the
city economy after the closure of the textile mills had not occurred
(Kundu 2000: 3181). This conclusion is incorrect, since workers in
small-scale manufacturing enterprises, such as powerloom units, diamond
ateliers, and garment workshops, may have regular work, but they
can be dismissed at any time and do not enjoy the social provisions that
accompany formal sector status. Those of my respondents who fell into
this category told me that they often did not work more than 15 to 20
days a month. They had to report to the boss every day, but he could
send them away and tell them to come back the following day or week,
without explanation. It is this lack of job security that is responsible for
the pattern of rotation between different locations (places of work),
economic sectors (the retail trade, building, small-scale industry), and
modes of employment (self-employed, casual day labour, member of a
gang led by a jobber). Employees in small workshops usually consist, on
the one hand, of a core group who have proved their loyalty to their boss
or a subcontractor and who have reasonably steady work (more than 20
days a month) and, on the other hand, of semi-regular workers who work
only if the boss needs them. This is not to say that this latter group are
not considered --- in their own eyes and by others --- as regular employees.
The point is that this does not necessarily mean that they have a full-time
job. They have no security that their labour power will indeed be
required on a regular basis and, moreover, they are paid almost without
exception on a piecemeal basis. The advantage of this arrangement for
the employer is that he has a sufficient pool of reserve labour to use as
necessary and can instantly expand or contract production in response to
demand.
