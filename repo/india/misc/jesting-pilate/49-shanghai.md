## SHANGHAI {.chapter-title}

::: chapter-content
I have seen places that were, no doubt, as busy and as thickly populous
as the Chinese city in Shanghai, but none that so overwhelmingly
impressed me with its business and populousness. In no city, West or
East, have I ever had such an impression of dense, rank, richly clotted
life. Old Shanghai is Bergson's *Ã©lan vital* in the raw, so to speak,
and with the lid off. It is Life itself. Nothing more intensely living
can be imagined. There are as many people --- there are very likely
more --- in an equal area of London or Lahore, of Glasgow or Bombay; but
there is not so much life. Each individual Chinaman has more vitality,
you feel, than each individual Indian or European, and the social
organism composed of these individuals is therefore more intensely alive
than the social organism in India or the West. Or perhaps it is the
vitality of the social organism --- a vitality accumulated and economised
through centuries by ancient habit and tradition-perhaps it is the
intense aliveness and strength of the Chinese civilisation, which give
to individual Chinamen their air of possessing a superabundance of life
beyond the vital wealth of every other race. So much life, so carefully
canalised, so rapidly and strongly flowing --- the spectacle of it
inspires something like terror. All this was going on when we were
cannibalistic savages. It will still be going on --- a little modified,
perhaps, by Western science, but not much --- long after we in Europe have
simply died of fatigue. A thousand years from now the seal cutters will
still be engraving their seals, the ivory workers still sawing and
polishing; the tailors will be singing the merits oftheir cut and cloth,
even as they do to-day; the spectacled astrologers will still be
conjuring silver out of the pockets of bumpkins and amorous courtesans;
there will be a bird market, and eating-houses perfumed with delicious
cooking, and chemists' shops with bottles full of dried lizards, tigers'
whiskers, rhinoceros horns and pickled salamanders; there will be
patient jewellers and embroiderers of faultless taste, shops full of
marvellous crockery, and furriers who can make elaborate patterns and
pictures out of variously coloured fox-skins; there will still be
letter-writers at the street corners and men whose business it is to sit
in their open shops inscribing words of ancient wisdom on long red
scrolls --- and the great black ideographs will still be as perfectly
written as they are to-day, or were a thousand years ago, will be thrown
on to the red paper with the same apparent recklessness, the same real
and assured skill, by a long fine hand as deeply learned in the hieratic
gestures of its art as the hand of the man who is writing now. Yes, it
will all be there, just as intensely and tenaciously alive as ever --- all
there a thousand years hence, five thousand, ten. You have only to
stroll through old Shanghai to be certain of it. London and Paris offer
no such certainty. And even India seems by comparison provisional and
precarious.
