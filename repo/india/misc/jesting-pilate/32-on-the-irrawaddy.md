## ON THE IRRAWADDY {.chapter-title}

::: chapter-content
My reading on the Irrawaddy was *The Glass Palace Chronicle of the Kings
of Burma*. This curious work was prepared in 1829 at the command of King
Bagyidaw, who appointed a committee of the most famous scholars to
compile a definitive and authoritative chronicle from the existing
records. The result is probably the most learned edition of a fairy tale
that has ever been published.

The Burmese fancy has a peculiar flavour of its own. In the reigns of
the good kings, for example, there were repeated showers of gems, a
phenomenon of which I do not remember to have read in the fabulous
history of any other people. And what remarkable things happened
whenever a king died! Sometimes it was merely a matter of smoke issuing
from the palace. But it was seldom that the country got off so lightly;
a royal death ordinarily produced effects of a much more disturbing
character. Planets and even the Pleiades would pass across the disk of
the moon, or remain stationary for as much as seven months at a stretch.
Sometimes the river would flow up country and light would stream from
the earth. Sometimes --- a mystery which the translator does not
condescend to explain --- the *deinnatthÃ¨* coincided with the *thingyan*.
But perhaps the most unpleasant incident of all occurred when King
Hkanlat died. "About the time of his death an ogre wandered laughing
over the whole country for full seven days; and the people who heard the
ogre's laugh durst not sleep." Long live the King; the Burmese must have
repeated the loyal formula with a special and peculiar fervour.

This random selection of incidents from Burmese history is sufficient, I
think, to indicate the character of the chronicle as a whole. It is a
collection of fabulous anecdotes. But the charm of the fabulous quickly
palls, and it would be impossible to read more than a very few pages of
the *Glass Palace Chronicle*, if it were not for the solemn absurdities
introduced into it by the compiling scholars. These learned men collated
the several sources of their chronicle with the most laudable industry;
they weighed the credibility of varying texts; they applied the
principles of Higher Criticism to the ancient records and were bold to
reject even that which was old, if it offended against reason and
authoritative tradition. How learnedly and with what sober criticism do
they deal, for example, with the story of the Naga princess who had an
affair with the Sun Prince and, in consequence, laid a number of eggs
which hatched out, some into human children and some, surprisingly, into
iron and rubies! The comments of the scholars are too long and too
intricately learned to be quoted in full. But this is how they deal with
the question of the Naga princess's eggs :---

> "As for the statement that a human being was born from the union of
> the Sun Prince and a female Naga, these are the only parallel
> instances in the books: in the Bhuridatta Jataka, the birth of a human
> being after the father's kind from the union of a human prince with a
> female Naga and the birth of a Naga after the father's kind from the

> and in the Mahavamsa, such tales as the birth of Prince Sihabahu after

It is crushing, it is utterly conclusive. The female Naga and all her
eggs must be rejected. Reason and authority demand that we should accept
a more probable account of the origin of the young Pyusawhti, the Prince
who killed, with a magic bow, the Great Boar, the Great Bird, the Giant
Tiger and the Monstrous Flying Squirrel.

It is as though a committee of Scaligers and Bentleys had assembled to
edit the tales of the nursery. Perrault's chronicle of Red Riding Hood
is collated with Grimm's, the variants recorded, the credibility of the
two several versions discussed. And when that little matter has been
satisfactorily dealt with, there follows a long and incredibly learned
discussion of the obscure, the complex and difficult problems raised by
Puss in Boots. What language did the cat talk? And was he black or
tortoise shell, ginger or common tabby? Scaliger inclines to Latin and
tortoise-shell. Bentley, with more weight of evidence, prefers black and
Hebrew. A pleasing fancy. But when we pass from Red Riding Hood and Puss
in Boots to the fables of the Old Testament, the fancy becomes a fact.
In America it would appear, there are still people who can discuss the
first chapter of Genesis, the stories of Noah and Joshua with all the
earnest gravity of Burmese pundits discussing the Sun Prince and the
eggs of the female Naga.
