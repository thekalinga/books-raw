::: chapter-content
The precincts of the Shwe Dagon pagoda contain the world's finest
specimens of what I may call the merry-go-round style of architecture
and decoration. The huge bell-shaped spire, gilded from top to bottom
and shining, towards the sun, with intolerable high lights, stands in
the midst; and round it are grouped the hundreds of subsidiary shrines,
elaborately fretted, glittering like Aladdin's cave at the pantomime
with a gaudy mosaic of coloured glass, gilded and painted, or dark, with
the natural colour of the teakwood pinnacles and gables, against the
golden shining of the pagoda.

It seems a sacred Fun Fair, a Luna Park dedicated to the greater glory
of Gautama --- but more fantastic, more wildly amusing than any Bank
Holiday invention. Our memories, after a first visit, were of something
so curiously improbable, so deliriously and comically dream-like, that
we felt constrained to return the following day to make quite sure that
we had really seen it.
