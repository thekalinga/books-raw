::: chapter-content
Reporters were lying in wait on the quay to ask me what I thought about
the General Strike. I told them that I had been at sea for the last
month and was therefore entirely ignorant of current English affairs.
That made no difference, they assured me; they wanted my opinion all the
same. I gave them my prejudices, which are Fabian and mildly labourite.
They thanked me, took some photographs and departed. The photographs
appeared in the evening papers. They bore a certain resemblance to the
original. The camera cannot lie. Or, to be more accurate, it can lie;
but the process of making it lie is tedious and expensive. The
photographers had no sufficient inducement to improve my appearance. But
the speech which accompanied the pictures and which was attributed to
me, was beautifully unrecognisable. Such a paean in praise of capitalism
and Mr. Baldwin! It did one's heart good to read it. Labourism and
Fabian prejudices are not popular in America. The reporters had made me
respectable. It was meant, no doubt, as an act of kindness. Still I
should have preferred it if they had emended my face rather than my
opinions.
