A noble banyan tree stands by the side of the Jaunpur road, where it
leaves the Civil Lines. Under the dense foliage lingers a kind of
ecclesiastical darkness and the rooted and already massive offshoots
from the parent branches are the cathedral pillars. But the shoots which
have not yet reached the ground, but hang in the dim air like the ends
of aimlessly trailing cables, have an aspect strangely sinister and
unholy. They hang there, motionless; and the cathedral of the banyan
grove is transformed into a Piranesian prison.

The banyan is like the Hindu family. Its scions remain, even in
maturity, attached to the parent tree. The national tree of England is
the oak, and English families --- once, no doubt, as banyan-like as the
Indian --- are coming to resemble handfuls of scattered acorns that grow
up at a distance from their tree of origin. Those who have had, in India
or on the continent of Europe, any experience of the really united
banyan family, can only feel thankful at the turn our social botany is
taking
