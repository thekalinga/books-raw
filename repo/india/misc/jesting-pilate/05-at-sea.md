## AT SEA {.chapter-title}

::: chapter-content
Everybody in the ship menaces us with the prospect of a very "good time"
in India. A good time means going to the races, playing bridge, drinking
cocktails, dancing till four in the morning, and talking about nothing.
And meanwhile the beautiful, the incredible world in which we live
awaits our exploration, and life is short, and time flows stanchlessly,
like blood from a mortal wound. And there is all knowledge, all art.
There are men and women, the innumerable living, and, in books, the
souls of those dead who deserved to be immortal. Heaven preserve me, in
such a world, from having a Good Time! Heaven helps those who help
themselves. I shall see to it that my time in India is as bad as I can
make it.
