::: chapter-content
Cleared of the forests, tamed into park and garden, this tropical land
seems, under its perennially clouded skies, a piece of temperate Europe.
From our windows we looked out on to sloping lawns, set here and there
with huge umbrageous trees that looked almost like elms and oaks. The
clouds swam indolently overhead. A thin haze stippled the distances and
made them tenderly dim. We might have been looking out over a park in
the Thames valley, but a Thames valley, as you saw at a second glance,
deliriously dreaming of palm trees and orchids, and where the air was as
warm as blood. It was into an equatorial England that we had suddenly
stepped.
