::: chapter-content
The after-hatch was off. Hung high above the opening, the electric
lights glared down into the deep square well of the hold. The watcher,
leaning over the brink of the well, shouted and waved his arms. The
donkey-engine rattled responsively. Twenty sacks of potatoes came
rushing up from the depths. Ten feet above the level of the deck, they
were swung sideways by the transverse pull of a second rope, hung
suspended for a moment beyond the gunwale, then, at another signal from
the watcher, dropped down into the waiting lighter. The watcher raised
his hand again; again the engine rattled. Two empty loops of rope came
up over the ship's side, whipped across the deck and went down, writhing
like living snakes, into the well. At the bottom, far down, little men
caught at the trailing ropes, piled up the sacks, made fast. The watcher
shouted. Yet another quintal of potatoes came rushing up, swung
sideways, dropped out of sight over the edge of the ship. And so it
continued, all the night. Curiously, admiringly, and at last with a
growing sense of horror, I looked on. Moving bits of matter from one
point of the world's surface to another --- man's whole activity. And the
wisdom of the East, I reflected, consists in the affirmation that it is
better to leave the bits of matter where they are. Up to a point, no
doubt, the sages of the East are right. There are many bits of matter
which might be left in their place and nobody would be any the worse.
These particles of ink, for example, which I so laboriously transfer
from their bottle to the surface of the paper ...

We landed --- in what a sink! At Port Said they speak all languages,
accept every currency. But their exchange is robbery and they employ
their gift of tongues only for cheating. The staple industry of the
place seems to be the manufacture and sale of indecent photographs. They
are stocked in almost every shop; they are pressed upon you --- at prices
that decline astonishingly, as you walk away, from a sovereign to half a
crown --- by every loafer. The copiousness of the supply is proof of a
correspondingly large demand for these wares by passing travellers. In
these matters, it seems, many people are more agreeably excited by the
representation --- whether pictorial or verbal --- than by carnal reality. It
is a curious psychological fact, for which I can find no complete
explanation.
