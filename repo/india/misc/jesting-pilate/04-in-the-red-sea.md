::: chapter-content
Talking with Europeans who live and work in the East, I find that, if
they love the East (which they mostly do), it is always for the same
reason. In the East, they say, a man is somebody;
he has authority and is looked up to; he knows all the people who matter
and is known. At home, he is lost in the crowd, he does not count, he is
nobody. Life in the East satisfies the profoundest and most powerful of
all the instincts --- that of self-assertion. The young man who goes out
from a London suburb to take up a clerkship in India finds himself a
member of a small ruling community; he has slavish servants to order
about, dark-skinned subordinates to whom it is right and proper to be
rude. Three hundred and twenty million Indians surround him; he feels
incomparably superior to them all, from the _coolie_ to the _maharaja_, from
the untouchable to the thorough-bred Brahmin, from the illiterate
peasant to the holder of half a dozen European degrees. He may be
ill-bred, stupid, uneducated; no matter. His skin is white. Superiority
in India is a question of epiderms. No wonder if he loves the East. For
the European, Eastern conditions of life are a kind of intoxicant. But
the tipsiness they produce is more satisfactory than that which results
from the absorption of whisky. Alcohol, as the anonymous poet has said:

> Bids valour burgeon in strong men,
>
> Quickens the poet's wit and pen,
>
> Despises fate.

But the sense of power which it gives, the feeling of grandeur and
importance, are purely illusory and do not last. The intoxication of the
East is permanent, and the sense of greatness is not entirely an
illusion. The commercial traveller who goes East is really a greater man
(so long as he remains in the East) than his colleague in patent
medicines at home. Sobriety supervenes only when he returns to Europe.
In the West he finds his natural place in the social hierarchy. One out
of London's suburban millions, he feels homesick for the East. It is not
to be wondered at. What man likes to be sediment, when he might float
gallantly on the sunlit surface?
