# INTRODUCTORY

This paper[^/1] presents an analysis of the 1967 General Elections in
the Shirdi Assembly constituency in Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra.
This constituency consists of Kopargaon town (population 16,869)
and 82 of the 100 villages of Kopargaon taluka.

The constituency has been a traditional stronghold of the Congress
party and has supplied to it important leaders at the district, State,
and national levels. Nevertheless, the Congress candidate, a strong
candidate by all standards, was defeated by an Independent by a
margin of 8,901 votes after a keen contest. The Congress defeat at
Shirdi is all the more remarkable when we consider the fact that the
party emerged triumphant in the district and in the State as a whole.

Several conclusions emerge from an analysis of the campaign and
its background. One of these is that factional rivalries are in a way
more important than the opposition between political parties. People
switch their support from one party to another without much
besitation while factional affiliation is much more stable.

Factions are essentially local in character while parties are national
or at least regional in their scope. The contrast between the
elections based on factional strife and those involving national issues
is clearly perceived by the local people. They speak of the
former as _gatbajichi nivadnuk_ and of the latter as _rajakeeya nivadnuk_,
and feel that the two ought to be kept apart. As a matter of fact,
however, factional rivalry and party politics are closely interwoven.
This account will therefore deal in some detail with the nature and
growth of factionalism and its impact on various aspects of the
electoral process.

The hard core of factionalism is rivalry between two groups
and the leading personalities associated with them. The two principal
actors in the present narrative have been political rivals for over
fifteen years. Both of them had applied for the Congress ticket for
the Shirdi constituency in the 1967 elections. The applicant who was
refused the ticket had been the sitting Congress M.L.A. since 1962.
After he was turned down for the party ticket, he took it upon himself
to organize the defeat of his rival, the Congress candidate.
It is noteworthy that the Independent candidate whom he helped to
win in the 1967 elections had been his principal rival in the 1962
elections. The candidate who was favoured with the Congress
ticket this time had been earlier a member of the Peasants and
Workers Party (_PWP_). As the candidate of that party he had contested
against the Congress candidate in the 1952 elections. He had
worked actively against the Congress in the 1957 elections also.

The political rivalries expressed in the campaign originated in the
struggle for control over local institutions. A large number of new
structures of power have emerged in the area, and control over
them has often been a matter of bitter contention. Control over
certain new institutions such as the Taluka Panchayat Samiti
(_TPS_), the Zilla Parishad (_ZP_), the cooperative sugar factories,
and the District Central Cooperative Bank (_DCCB_) has become
crucial as they provide the human and material resources indispensable
for exercising political power.

The control over local institutions does not, however, automatically
ensure success at the State and the national levels. In fact,
those who had gained such control at the cost of much effort were the
ones who lost the election in the Shirdi constituency. People in
positions of power acquire not only supporters but also antagonists.
Effective mobilization of support depends on certain political skills.
As Dahl has pointed out (1961 and 1963), successful political
management requires not only resources but skills as well. The
contest between the Congress candidate and his Independent rival
in the Shirdi constituency brings out certain contrasts in the use of
skills and resources.

Apart from the new institutions such as cooperative societies and
Panchayat Samitis, there are also traditional institutions providing
bases for political support. Among these, one which is widely
discussed is caste. It was certainly used as a basis for gathering
support in Shirdi but its relation to the electoral process was
complex and mainly indirect.

Srinivas' concept of 'dominant caste' (1955 and 1959) is helpful
in understanding the role of caste in politics. For instance, there
were striking differences between the dominant caste and the other
castes in the role they played in the elections. The important candidates
and the leaders of the rival factions all belonged to the
dominant Maratha caste. This is consistent with the pattern of
politics in many rural constituencies in Maharashtra. The leaders
of both the factions were Marathas and therefore there was no
question of the Marathas voting as a block for either candidate.
No effort was made to capture the Maratha vote, nor were meetings
of the members of the Maratha caste organized. By contrast,
attempts were made to secure the votes, _en bloc_, of some of the
minority castes. There were meetings of the Mali, Nhavi, and
Dhangar castes, as well as of the Muslims, at which decisions were
taken to extend the caste's support to one or the other candidate.

# BACKGROUND OF THE REGION

The recent socio-economic history of Kopargaon taluka is intimately
connected with the construction of the Godavari irrigation
canals in 1916. Kopargaon was a famine-stricken area before this
period. The availability of irrigated land attracted a group of enterprising
farmers from Poona district. Most of them belonged to the
Mali caste, traditionally cultivators of irrigated crops. The canals
helped the farmers to cultivate sugarcane on a large scale, and
this eventually transformed the taluka into a prosperous agricultural
region.[^/2]

Three sugar factories organized as joint stock companies were
established in the taluka during the thirties. At about the same
time, a number of cooperative credit societies and the Cooperative
Sale Purchase Union (_CSPU_) were set up mainly for the benefit
of sugarcane growers. The establishment of a cooperative sugar
factory in 1955 was a landmark in the economic and political life
of the area as the factory became an important locus of power.
Two more such factories came up a few years later. In 1957, the
District Co-operative Central Bank (_DCCB_) and the District Cooperative Land Development Bank
(_DCLDB_) were established. These new institutions were intimately
linked with the economic life of not only sugarcane
growers and other agriculturists but also of agricultural labourers
and factory workers. They have become new bases of power, and
politics in Kopargaon taluka is greatly influenced by the struggle
for control of these institutions.[^/3] Since 1962, the newly created
village panchayats, the _TPS_, and the _ZP_ have added new dimensions
to local politics.

In Kopergaon taluka, as in many other parts of Maharashtra,
the Marathas are decisively dominant, enjoying most of the elements
of dominance enumerated by Srinivas (1955: 18, 26; and
1959: 1). They are numerically preponderant, constituting the
largest single group (about 40 per cent of the total population).
They enjoy political and economic power, occupy a relatively high
ritual status, and have recently taken to Western education. The
Mahars are the second largest group, constituting about 10 per cent
of the total population. Most of them embraced Buddhism following
the lead of the late Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. Although politically
very conscious, they are economically dependent on the Marathas
and other peasant castes. The Brahmins, numerically insignificant,
are concentrated in Kopargaon town. Most of them are in the
professions and services, although a few are actively engaged
in agriculture. Besides the Marathas, other peasant castes are
Malis, Karekars, Vanjaris, and Dhangars, who are insignificant
numerically but significant in certain other ways. The Malis are
the most prosperous of the minority castes. Finally, there are a
few Marwari and Gujarati traders in Kopargaon town who frequently
take an active interest in local politics.[^/4]

As Srinivas has rightly pointed out, the introduction of adult franchise
and Panchayati Raj have enhanced the power of the dominant
caste (1962: 5). Thus, while before 1947 the Malis and other nonMarathas
were frequently elected to the Taluka Board, the District
Local Board, and the State Assembly, after 1947 these and similar
other positions have been occupied mostly by the Marathas.

The Congress is the main party in Kopargaon taluka. The Republican
Party, the Praja Socialist Party (_PSP_), and the Jan Sangh (_JS_)
have also some following. The _PWP_ had a large following till
1960 when its leaders joined the Congress, resulting in the disintegration
of the local _PWP_ unit.

# HISTORY OF FACTIONALISM IN LOCAL POLITICS

Generally, the local units of political parties are active only
during the General Elections while factions are active most of the
time. Factions are known as _gats_ and each _gat_ takes its name
from its leader or leaders. Thus a faction led by Rohmare is known
as Rohmare _gat_ while the rival faction led by Kale and Kolhe is
known as Kale--Kolhe _gat_. When, recently, Gade and his followers
joined the Rohmare _gat_ it came to be known as Rohmare--Gade _gat_.
The _gats_ do not have a formal organization --- constitution, office-bearers,
etc. --- like political parties. They are loosely structured and
function mainly through informal networks of relationships. Since
the _gats_ function mainly as contenders for power there is a tendency
towards coalitions between various leaders and their followers,
leaving ultimately only two rival _gats_ in the field to compete for
power. Occasionally, minor leaders and their followers move from
one _gat_ to another, but the main leaders and their core supporters
show on the whole remarkable stability and persistence in their
loyalty to a particular _gat_. The cleavages based on loyalty to
different factions run through all the levels of local politics,
village, taluka, and district. Factional following cuts across castes
and sometimes across political parties. In the local context the
factions often function like political parties. They select each a
'panel' of candidates for elections to village panchayats, the _TPS_,
the _ZP_, village cooperative societies, cooperative sugar factories,
and similar other institutions. They frequently use the idiom of
party politics in their deliberations and working. For instance, they
appoint 'parliamentary boards' to select candidates for particular
elections, and speak of 'party discipline' in dealing with erring
members. Srinivas has reported how 'party' has become a Kannada
word in Rampura (1955: 32). People often said, "there is too
much 'party' in such and such a village," meaning thereby that
there was too much of factionalism. In Kopargaon too people
frequently refer to the _gats_ as 'parties', e.g., Rohmare party and
Kale party. Factional rivalry is known as _gatbaji_. Although
_gatbaji_ is widespread and persistent and accepted as a reality by all,
it is also regarded as something bad and each rival leader often
accuses the other of indulging in it.

The Rohmare _gat_ and the Kale _gat_ have functioned as rival factions
in Kopargaon for at least fifteen years. Both the leaders are
Marathas and in their forties. They are also prosperous cane-growers.
Rohmare has taken high school education and had participated
in the freedom struggle during his student days. He was
active in the Congress for about twenty years. He resigned from it
just before the 1967 General Elections. Kale has university degrees
in science and engineering. He resigned from his job in the
Government to join the _PWP_ in the fifties. In 1952, he contested
for the Assembly as a _PWP_ candidate and lost to a Congress
candidate supported by Rohmare. In 1957, when Rohmare was
defeated as a Congress candidate, Kale had worked against him and
supported a Communist, sponsored by the Samyukta Maharashtra
Samiti (_SMS_). The two leaders and their supporters opposed
each other in the elections to the cooperative sugar factories, the
Cooperative Sale--Purchase Union, and similar other institutions.

The creation of a separate Marathi-speaking State in May 1960
marked a turning point in the recent political history of Maharashtra.
The powerful _SMS_, composed of several opposition
parties, disintegrated soon afterwards. The Maharashtra Pradesh
Congress Committee (_MPCC_) led by Y. B. Chavan followed a
bold policy of inviting opposition leaders to the Congress fold and
offering them important positions in the party and the Government.
In Ahmednagar district also, the _PWP_ leader Kale and several
others joined the Congress.

For a period of about two and a half years the Rohmare and
Kale factions worked together. Consequently, the elections to the
various important cooperatives and other institutions were unanimous
during this 'period of unity,' as the local people describe
it. This boosted the confidence of the local leaders, and they
decided to play a more decisive role in district politics. They
planned to secure control over the District Congress Committee
(_DCC_), the _DCCB_, and the _ZP_. They succeeded, though
only partially, in their plans. It was also during this period that
Rohmare was elected to the State Assembly in 1962 with an overwhelming
majority against his Independent rival Gade, who was
supported by the opposition parties such as _PSP_, Jan Sangh, and
Republican Party. They hoped that Rohmare would be included in
the State cabinet.

In the process of capturing these offices, dissensions reappeared
among the leaders of Kopargaon taluka. When they pressed for
Rohmare's inclusion in the State cabinet, the Congress leaders from
other parts of the district opposed it, mainly on account of Rohmare's
close association with a Brahmin leader Bharde, to whom
Rohmare owed his rise to power. Rohmare himself pressed for
Bharde's continuation in the cabinet, and this was resented by Kale
and his followers.

Kale's Presidentship of the _ZP_ resulted in further estrangement
between the two leaders and their followers. Due to the Presidentship
he came in closer contact with those who had, like himself, joined
the Congress recently. His position in the _ZP_ depended largely
on their support. He also shared their resentment against the domination
of the party by 'old' Congressmen such as Bharde, Firodia
(a Marwari), and Rohmare. His position in the _ZP_ helped him to
extend his sphere of influence all over the district. He soon
started working against Rohmare and his group with the help of
the 'new' Congressmen in the district.

The elections to offices in the _DCC_ Bank in December 1962
brought about an open rift between the two leaders and their
supporters, thus ending the 'period of unity.' Rohmare succeeded
in becoming the Chairman of the Bank at the cost of unity within
the group. The bitterness and intensity of group rivalry were further
accentuated when disputes developed over controlling the newly
established Sanjivani Cooperative Sugar Factory and the Taluka
Congress Committee (_TCC_). The dispute over the _TCC_ resulted
in the emergence of two rival _TCC_s each claiming to be the
legitimate _TCC_.

The period 1963--66 was marked by intense conflict between the
two factions. The factional cleavages reappeared openly at the
village, taluka, and district levels and in all the important institutions
and organizations. All local elections were keenly contested
on the basis of factional divisions. Although Rohmare retained
the loyalty and support of most of his supporters he lost control
over all important organizations excepting the Cooperative Sale
Purchase Union and the Taluka Cooperative Supervising Union.
The ascendancy of Kale _gat_ and the decline of Rohmare _gat_
was largely due to the support the former received at the district
and State levels from the 'new' Congressmen who were now occupying
important positions in the party and the Government.

# THE CHOICE OF CANDIDATES

Parties, factions and similar other groups have to make their own
choice of candidates before the electors are called upon to make
their choice. This selection of candidates is a part of the larger
electoral process. Because of the dominant position of the Congress
party in Maharashtra, other parties and groups generally
decided upon their candidates only after the Congress party had
announced its own. The selection of the Congress candidates
became complicated wherever the local party unit was divided into
rival factions. The support claimed by each faction leader and the
consequences of displeasing the unsuccessful faction had to be
taken into account.

The selection of the Congress candidates was made by the
Pradesh Election Committee (_PEC_) of the _MPCC_ The Home
Minister of India, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, the President
of the _MPCC_, and a few other prominent State leaders took a
leading part in this process. Kale and Rohmare were the main
contenders for the party ticket in Shirdi, and both the Kopargaon
_TCC_ and the Ahmednagar _DCC_ had strongly recommended
Kale's case. While Rohmare's supporters pleaded for him on the
strength of his long association with the party and his loyalty
to the organization, Kale's supporters pleaded for him in the
interest of encouraging new and emerging leadership. They opposed
Rohmare because he had publicly criticised the party leaders and
some ministers, thus violating party discipline. In contrast, they
pointed to Kale's proven ability to work in cooperation with other
party workers in the district, his successful work as the _ZP_ President,
and his popularity as evident in bis success against Rohmare
in the local elections. Various alternatives, including the offer
of a Lok Sabha seat to Kale and of membership of the Legislative
Council to Rohmare, had to be abandoned as the two sides
were adamant. The _PEC_ finally yielded to the pressure of the
Kale faction and recommended Kale for the Congress ticket.

Attempts by prominent Congress leaders to persuade the Rohmare
faction to support Kale at the elections proved futile. Within the
Rohmare faction itself opinion was divided about the future
course of action. A small minority wanted to be neutral to the elections,
as opposing the Congress candidate may mean estranging
their relations with the ruling party. Another section wanted to
vote and work against Kale while remaining in the Congress. This
was turned down, as to be in the party and yet work against its
candidate was considered 'immoral.' The view that prevailed
ultimately was that they should openly 'revolt' against the injustice
done to them by the party. They believed that this was the only
course which would enable them to defeat Kale as well as to convey
their feelings to the top Congress leaders, including Chavan, who
understood only the language of strength. Consequently, nearly
3,000 men publicly declared their decision to quit the party. For
a large number of them, however, the decision was more symbolic
than real, because ever since the beginning of the dispute over the
control of the _TCC_, the followers of the Rohmare _gat_ had not
succeeded in renewing formally their membership of the Congress
party.

There were some defectors in the Rohmare faction. A prominent
supporter of his belonging to the Vanjari caste decided to side with
Kale, presumably on the advice of the Chief Minister, also a Vanjari.
In spite of this, however, most of the Vanjaris extended their
support to Rohmare. The bulk of Rohmare's followers decided to
leave the Congress and work for Kale's defeat. This was far beyond
the fears of the Kale _gat_ which had anticipated only non-cooperation
or disguised opposition at worst.

The net result of these developments was that those who had been
active in the Congress for over twenty years deserted it to make
room for those who had opposed it till 1960. One of the leaders
of the Kale _gat_ remarked that the new Congress unit in Kopargoan
looked very much like the old _PWP_ unit in the area.

The initiative for defeating the Congress in Shirdi now rested with
none else but a faction within the party. The Rohmare faction rejected
the idea of fielding Rohmare himself as its candidate. His
long and intimate association with the Congress was a handicap.
The electors might be cynical about voting for a man who had left
his party just because he had not been given a ticket. The other
parties may also not like to support him. The choice fell on a prosperous,
educated, and young Maratha, Gade. He had a Master's
degree in agriculture from an American university. He was in the
Congress till 1962, when his membership was suspended for his
having contested against Rohmare, who was then the official
Congress candidate. At that time, Gade was supported by all the
opposition parties and secured over 16,000 votes, although Rohmare
defeated him by a margin of over 12,000 votes.

During the last five years Gade had built up a considerable personal
following. When the old factional divisions reappeared in
Kopargaon towards the end of 1962, he joined the Kale--Kolhe _gat_.
In fact his joining this _gat_ contributed significantly to the decline of
the Rohmare _gat_. However, by the latter half of 1965 he had fallen
out with both Kale and Kolhe. Gade put forward certain conditions
before agreeing to stand against Kale. Firstly, he wanted
Rohmare and others in his _gat_ to resign from the Congress and
work openly for him, to make certain that the two factions would
not come together. Secondly, he wanted their help in trying to persuade
other parties and Independents to refrain from contesting
the elections so that there could be a straight fight. Thirdly, he
wanted them to contribute substantially to his election expenses.
The Rohmare _gat_ was reported to have accepted all the conditions.
While the Rohmare--Gade _gat_ wanted a straight fight, the Congress
worked for a multi-cornered fight so that the non-Congress vote
could be split.

Besides the Congress, the _PSP_, the Republican Party, and the
Jan Sangh have some following in the taluka. The _PSP_'s following
was confined mainly to the workers in the four sugar factories
in the constituency whose 'representative union' it controlled.[^/5]
The four factories together employed about 6,000 workers. The
_PSP_ did not have its own candidate, either for the Assembly or
for the Lok Sabha, in Shirdi. It decided to extend its support
to Gade.

In the Kopargaon taluka, as elsewhere in Maharashtra, the Jan
Sangh is a weak party whose following is confined mainly to the
Brahmins in urban areas. The total Jan Sangh support in the
constituency was estimated to be between three and four thousand.
A Maratha follower of the Jan Sangh, belonging to Gade's village,
had filed his nomination for the Assembly from Shirdi. However,
Rohmare and Gade succeeded in securing his withdrawal by promising
their support to the Jan Sangh candidate for the Lok Sabha
 --- a Brahmin. Some followers of the Rohmare--Gade _gat_ were not
happy at this deal. They had no sympathy for the Jan Sangh and
feared that extending their support to a Brahmin might prove
politically expensive. They tried to play down the agreement
reached with the Jan Sangh.

The strength of the Republican vote in Shirdi was estimated at
about 10,000. It may be noted here that this party was founded by
Ambedkar and now commands the allegiance mostly of the ex-untouchable
Mahars, many of whom have embraced Buddhism.
Though the party has suffered from widespread dissensions and
factionalism since Ambedkar's death, its supporters have a reputation
for political awareness and voting _en bloc_. Gade tried to persuade
Roham, the President of the party in the district, that the Republicans
would not be able to win in a constituency-like Shirdi which
was not reserved for the Scheduled Castes. Unconvinced by these
arguments, Robam filed his nomination for the Assembly. Besides
Roham, another Republican, Nikale, had also filed his nomination.
Although persuaded to support Roham, his name appeared on the
ballot papers as it was too late to formally withdraw.

Another Independent candidate was Gavali who had contested
with a view to protest against the Government's failure to support
cooperative farming societies. He had a limited following and
resources and little influence over the electorate.

Kale and Gade were thus the only serious candidates for the
Assembly seat, although five candidates had filed nominations (see
Table 1).

:Table 1: CANDIDATES IN THE SHIRDI CONSTITUENCY

Shirdi was one of the six Assembly constituencies which together
formed the Kopargaon Lok Sabha constituency. There were three
candidates for Lok Sabha. The Congress had put up Shinde, who
had risen to power mainly through his work in the cooperatives.
He was the Deputy Minister for Food, Agriculture, Cooperation, and
Community Development in the Union Ministry of Food and
Agriculture at the time of the elections. Kadu, a lawyer as well as
farmer in the neighbouring Rahuri taluka, was the candidate of the
Communist Party of India (_CPI_) supported by the Sampoorna
Maharashtra Samiti (_SMS_). The _SMS_ was composed mainly
of the _CPI_, the Republican Party, the _PWP_, and the Samyukta
Socialist Party. Apart from the objective of defeating the Congress,
the _SMS_ also stood for the merger with Maharashtra of the
Marathi speaking areas in Mysore State. Chandekar, a Brahmin
employed as a clerk in a sugar factory, was the Jan Sangh candidate,
supported by the _PSP_.

Kadu and Roham campaigned jointly as their parties were constituents
of the _SMS_ I have already mentioned the Jan Sangh
candidate's alliance with the Rohmare--Gade _gat_. It may be noted
here that the people in general did not show the same degree of
interest in the Lok Sabha elections as in the Assembly elections.
The Lok Sabha elections will not be discussed here except in so far
as they are related to the Assembly elections.

# THE CAMPAIGN

Factional loyalties and animosities generated by the struggle for
control over the local structures of power figured prominently in
the election campaign of both the candidates. Kale's campaign
was aimed at winning over those whom he and his followers had
estranged in the process of factional conflict. Several of the cooperative
societies at the village, taluka, district, and factory levels
were controlled by them and they had displeased many in the
process of administering these institutions. The Kale _gat_ emphasized
the need to distinguish between local and national elections.
The General Elections were a political contest between different
parties with different ideologies, policies, and programmes.
Groupism and factional rivalry (_gatbaji_) were out of place in this
contest. The voters were asked to consider Kale not as a leader
of a local faction, but as a candidate of the Congress party which
alone stood for democracy and socialism and was capable of providing
a stable government.

The strategy of the Rohmare--Gade _gat_ was exactly the opposite.
Gade, being an Independent candidate, concentrated on purely
local issues in his campaign. The emphasis was on the alleged
misdeeds of local Congressmen, particularly Kale, and the mismanagement
of local institutions. Another strategy was to highlight
the difficulties of everyday life under the Congress rule.
They stressed issues which were of interest to the common man,
such as spiralling prices, shortages of various commodities, widespread
corruption, and the greed for power among the Congress
leaders. Little attention was paid to such remote issues as the
country's defence, international relations, devaluation of the rupee,
and ban on cow slaughter.

While the strategy of the two main candidates differed, each had
to take note of what the other was saying and to answer the allegations
made against him. The Kale _gat_ which stressed the 'national
character of the elections had to reply to charges of corruption and
maladministration in local matters. The Gade--Rohmare faction
which concentrated on local issues had to say something about
'national' issues.

The Congressmen argued that theirs was the only party which
could rule the country effectively. They emphasized the part played
by it in the Freedom Movement, its dedication to democracy,
and the progress achieved by the country in various spheres under
Congress rule in spite of numerous difficulties. They pointed out
that supporting the Congress at Shirdi and elsewhere in Maharashtra
would strengthen Chavan's hands in Delhi. They also
questioned the integrity of Rohmare and his followers as they had
left the Congress only after Rohmare had been refused a ticket.

An important charge against the Rohmare faction was that it
had refused to give accounts of the _TCC_ funds, amounting to
over a lakh of rupees, collected mainly from the shareholders of
the different cooperatives during Rohmare's period in power. Gade
was accused of being an opportunist and a man without any firm
base: "a pot without a bottom." He had changed sides several
times during the past five years. On some occasions he had supported
the Rohmare _gat_ and on others the Kale _gat_. They also
pointed out the uselessness of electing an Independent and the
advantages of electing a candidate from the ruling party.

The Rohmare faction denied that they quit the Congress because
Rohmare was denied the party ticket. Nearly 3,000 people from
all over the taluka had left the party and decided to work for its
defeat. This indicated that the discontent against the party was
more general than personal. Gade maintained that there was no
inconsistency in his political stand. He opposed the Congress candidate
(Rohmare) in 1962 as an Independent, and now also he was
opposing the Congress candidate (Kale) as an Independent. It was
Kale and his supporters who lacked consistency. They had worked
against the Congress in 1952 and 1957. Now they were supporting
the Congress because they wanted power. Gade argued that supporting
different individuals and groups on different occasions in
elections to cooperative societies did not imply inconsistency. It
was his conviction that elections to cooperative institutions should
not be mixed up with party politics.

The Rohmare--Gade faction accused the Kale--Kolhe faction of being
Communists, or sympathisers of Communists, who had ousted
the old Congressmen by encouraging 'groupism' within the party.
The latter were also accused of being unscrupulous and having abused
power in the cooperative institutions under their control. The Banks
controlled by them refused loans to their rivals. In one of the cooperative
sugar factories, the Kale _gat_, on losing the majority, made
unfair use of its influence with the Government to have the Board
of Directors suspended and a Government administrator appointed.
During the elections to the Presidentship of the Kopargaon Municipality
in 1964, several councillors were 'kidnapped' to Goa by the
Kale _gat_ and coerced to vote for its candidate. Kale and his supporters
were influenced by factional rivalries even in the matter of
donations to educational institutions. The Kale faction defended
itself against these charges and made its own charges against the
Rohmare faction.

To sum up, the Congress party was not successful in highlighting
national issues in the election campaign. Local issues were brought
to the fore by the Rohmare _gat_, and the Kale _gat_ could not help getting
involved in them.

An effective strategy and the selection of the right issues to influence
the voter are by themselves not enough for victory. The
availability of resources, both human and material, and their skilful
deployment are also essential (see Dahl 1963: 15, 69).

Both the Kale and the Gade groups were roughly equal in resources.
Although Kale bad a slight edge over Gade, the latter seemed
to have used his resources more skilfully. Kale's chief advantage
was derived from his membership of the ruling party. Unlike Gade
who had to depend entirely on local resources, Kale was helped in
his campaign by the Congress party organization at various levels.
The _MPCC_ organized party workers' camps to streamline the
election machinery. It published a number of pamphlets to familiarise
the voters with the party manifesto and its programmes and
policies. Copies of a Marathi daily published by it in Poona were
distributed free in villages through selected party members. Two
local Marathi weeklies, which derived much of their revenue from
advertisements of the local cooperatives, actively helped the Congress
campaign.

The Congress election campaigns were addressed by such prominent
leaders as Chavan, the then Union Home Minister, Naik, the
State Chief Minister, Sadiq Ali, the _AICC_ General Secretary,
and several State ministers. Chavan, because of his unique position
in State politics, was by far the biggest 'vote-catcher' for the
Congress in Maharashtra. Both Chavan and Naik used these
occasions to criticise and ridicule Rohmare and to praise Kale and
Shinde for the services they had rendered to the country.

The Congress candidate had a well-equipped election office at the
_TCC_ headquarters, and a local Maratha lawyer was in overall
charge of the campaign. Estimating the election expenses of a
candidate is very difficult, but it is an open secret that the legally
prescribed limit of eight thousand rupees for an Assembly election
is totally unrealistic. Candidates usually tended to exaggerate the
money spent by their rivals. They also accused each other of
distributing money for 'purchasing' votes, which again was difficult
to substantiate. However, various informants put the expenses of
the Congress candidate and his chief rival Gade about 50,000
rupees each.

The running mates of Kale and Gade for the Lok Sabha seat were
both absent from the election campaign in Shirdi. Shinde was
suddenly taken ill, and it is difficult to estimate the damage suffered
by the Congress on account of this. (Shinde was, however, elected
to the Lok Sabha, although by a lower margin than in 1962.) Gade's
Jan Sangh running mate for Lok Sabha was advised by Gade to
keep away from Shirdi, because he wanted to play down his association
with the Jan Sangh.

The Kale _gat_ controlled the Kopargaon Municipality, the
_TPS_, and two of the three cooperative sugar factories at the
taluka level, and the _DCC_ Bank, the _DCLD_ Bank, the
_DCC_, the _ZP_, three cooperative sugar factories, and several
other institutions at the district level. The vehicles and other
resources of these institutions were used during the campaign.
Just before the elections, the _TPS_ liberally issued permits for
cement and corrugated iron sheets which were in great demand
among farmers for constructing wells and sheds. The _ZP_ President
Kale and the _TPS_ President Kolhe were approached
by villagers to take up or expedite developmental activities such
as minor irrigation schemes, approach roads, and school buildings.
Both of them readily promised a sympathetic consideration of such
demands. Kale and Kolhe also used the meetings connected with
the work of the _ZP_ and the _TPS_ bodies for election purposes.

A large number of factory workers supported Gade. Kale could
use only a few workers who were loyal to the management. They
were asked to canvass for him in the factory colony as well as in
their villages.

Both the candidates tried to use the traditional loyalties of caste
and kinship to mobilize support. Appeals were issued on their
behalf at meetings of the minority castes such as Malis, Nhavis,
Dhangars, Sonars, and the Muslims by caste leaders. Sometimes
resolutions were passed pledging the support of the caste as a whole
to a candidate. Both the factions distributed printed statements
signed by prominent members of individual castes pledging 'unanimous'
support for a candidate. The Deputy Speaker of the Maharashtra
Assembly, a Mali and Congressman, wrote to the leaders
of his caste appealing to them to work for Congress candidates. A
leader of a Muslim religious organization from another district
appealed to the Muslim voters to support Gade. It is significant
that no meetings of the dominant Maratha caste were held and no
attempts made to catch the Maratha vote by issuing statements on
behalf of the caste. A minority caste leader was often referred to
as a leader of a particular caste, but no Maratha leader was ever
referred to that way.

Not only was Gade fighting the elections mainly on local issues
but his resources were also largely local. Being an Independent, he
did not have any outside leader to support his campaign. His campaign
was run by an election committee, and all leaflets, statements
and programmes were issued in its name. The old _TCC_ office
controlled by the Rohmare _gat_ was used as the office of the election
committee. Not only the room and furniture but also the men
running the office were the same.

Although Gade did not have a newspaper of his own, a daily
published from the district town supported him consistently. The
Poona dailies which generally supported opposition parties also gave
him occasional publicity.

Among the institutions controlled by the Gade--Rohmare _gat_, the
Cooperative Sale--Purchase Union was the only institution comparable
in resources to a cooperative factory. Gade used the trucks
and other vehicles owned by the _CSPU_ for his campaign. The
_gat_ also controlled the Taluka Cooperative Supervising Union which
had the power to appoint secretaries of the village cooperative
societies. It was alleged that the _gat_ appointed three young men as
secretaries in order to enlist their support, Gade also enjoyed the
support of the _PSP_ controlled Sugar Workers' Union. Its leaders
and members took an active part in canvassing for him. Gade was
also able to win over workers owing allegiance to the Republican
Party, thus demonstrating his political skill. While he took care to
praise Ambedkar's services to the country and refer to Robam in
respectful terms, in public meetings and informal talks with Republicans
he pointed out that Roham's decision to contest only
helped the Congress candidate by splitting the opposition vote. He
appealed to Roham to withdraw to ensure the defeat of the Congress.
Gade's leiutenants did not, however, show the same respect
to Roham; they accused him of accepting money from the Congress
in order to stand from this constituency.

The Rohmare--Gade _gat_ made certain tactical moves which showed
its skill in using its more limited resources. Kale began his
campaign rather'early --- a month before the filing of nominations.
As a result, his supporters could not sustain their interest till the
end. Gade, on the other hand, launched his campaign vigorously
only about three weeks before the polling, and planned his campaign
in such a way that its tempo rose gradually to a climax towards
the end. Both the candidates arranged a procession and a meeting
on the last day of the campaign. Gade's procession was more impressive
and his meeting attracted a larger audience. This had a
great impact on the voters. The Congress procession and meeting
lacked colour because its workers were tired after arranging
the Chief Minister's public meeting on the previous day --- a tactical
error. The Rohmare--Gade faction's political skill was evident
when it announced a meeting soon after Chavan addressed a Congress
rally, in order to answer the charges made by him. This move
paid off since many who had come to hear Chavan stayed on. Gade,
a forceful speaker, used this opportunity to minimise the impact of
Chavan's speech.

# THE RESULT

of the 82,432 voters in the Shirdi constituency, 61,225 (73 per cent)
exercised their franchise. There were 3,782 invalid votes in the
Assembly poll and 2,625 in the Lok Sabha poll. The distribution
of valid votes among the various candidates is given in Table 2.1 & Table 2.2.

Gade defeated his nearest rival Kale by 8,901 votes. The other
three candidates forfeited their deposits. The Congress leaders were
surprised to find their candidate defeated by a big margin. The
poor polling by Roham, the Republican candidate, was a surprise
to all. Gade had evidently succeeded in winning the Neo-Buddhist
votes, contrary to the expectations of the Kale faction.

The percentage of votes polled by Gade and Kale in the various
booths in the constituency is shown in Table 3. Gade secured over
60 per cent votes in twentyfive booths, while Kale polled over 60 per
cent votes in only eight booths. The booth-wise analysis of voting
reveals that in most booths the voting followed the line of factional
cleavage. Almost every village in the constituency was divided
into two rival factions. This was due primarily to the struggle for
power in local structures such as the panchayat and the cooperative
society. It was usual for one of the factions to join the Kale--Kolhe
_gat_ and the other to join the Rohmare--Gade _gat_. This affiliation of
factions at the taluka level helped to further intensify factional
rivalry within the village. The strength of a village faction is determined
by its control over local power structures. The support that
Kale and Gade were able to muster in the villages depended largely
on their ability to command the loyalty of the faction in power.
For instance, Kale secured a big lead in his own village, Kolhe's
village, and the _TCC_ President's village. Gade secured a lead
over Kale in his own village, Rohmare's village, and other villages
where the supporters of their _gat_ were in power. The strength of
factional loyalties can be seen from the fact that Gade secured
93.7 per cent of the votes in his village and 76.8 per cent of the
votes in Rohmare's village.

:TABLE 3: DISTRIBUTION OF BOOTHS BY PERCENTAGE OF VOTES POLLED BY GADE AND KALE

Controlling a local structure of power does not, however, always
ensure success in elections. It sometimes works as a double-edged
weapon, as it happened in the case of Kopargaon town. The
Kale--Kolhe _gat_ which controlled the Kopargaon Municipality had
antagonised a large section of the population in the process of
managing its affairs. Moreover, the minority castes, including
Brahmins, and most Marwari and Gujarati traders supported Gade.
This resulted in Gade gaining a lead over Kale in all the ten booths
in the town, where he secured 64.6 per cent of the votes against 33.5
per cent by Kale.

The booths where Gade did better than Kale revealed two other
broad characteristics. First, Gade secured more votes in booths in
which factory workers predominated. I have already discussed the
reasons for their support to him. Second, the booths where the
minority castes predominated showed a marked preference for
Gade. For instance, Gade secured 83.4 per cent votes in the Vanjaridominated
Vadgaon, and 78.9 per cent in the Mali-dominated
Manjur.

The minority castes appeared to be more sympathetic to the
Rohmare--Gade _gat_. Kale and his supporters were considered advocates
of Maratha domination and as being hostile to some of the
minority castes. This was perhaps due to their past association
with the _PWP_ which was identified in the popular mind as the
party of Marathas. While admitting that they had not succeeded
in gaining the confidence of the minorities, Kale _gat_ alleged that
this was the result of a systematic campaign by the Rohmare _gat_
which always thought on caste lines.

Rohmare, on the other hand, enjoyed the goodwill of large
sections of the minority castes. In fact this was stated to be his old
and tested strategy. Given the fact that the Marathas were more or
less equally divided into rival factions, Rohmare always depended
on the support of the minority castes to defeat his rivals in elections.

Specific interests of a caste at times influenced voting. The Malis
in Kopargaon taluka, most of whom are cane-growers, are immigrants
from Poona. The influence they wield is out of all proportion
to their numbers, and this is due mainly to their wealth. Although
they have a tradition of support to the Congress, they voted against
Kale. This was due to Kale's association with the demand that
some of the facilities enjoyed by the Malis in the use of canal waters
be withdrawn. The Malis feared that if Kale got elected and became
the Irrigation Minister, as was rumoured, it would harm their
interests.

The Rohmare--Gade _gat_ claimed that Gade's victory was evidence
of the people's disapproval of the way in which the Kale--Kolhe _gat_
was managing the various institutions under its control. The Kale--Kolhe
_gat_ held meetings to review the elections and discuss the
causes of their defeat. Some leaders criticised the working of the
_TCC_. The use of money by the other side to win votes, especially
those of the poorer sections such as the Harijans, was mentioned.
Some stressed that it was not the defeat of the Congress programme
or ideology; it was not a 'political' (_rajakeeya_) election but an
election based on factional rivalries (_gatbaji_). To make the
distinction clear a district Congress leader referred to another
constituency in the district where a Communist had defeated a
Congress candidate which was, for him, a real defeat of the Congress
since it was a 'political election.

# CONCLUSION

The rival candidates, their supporters, and voters in general took
keen interest in the Assembly elections in Shirdi. The turn out in
this constituency --- 73 per cent --- was the highest in the district. The
defeat of the Congress is clearly attributable to the factional
divisions within the party and the open support of the Rohmare
_gat_ for Gade. The splitting up of the Neo-Buddhist vote no doubt
assured Gade's victory by a larger margin, but it is doubtful if Kale
would have won even if this had not been the case.

The voters in Shirdi treated the elections as one more opportunity
for demonstrating their support to one or the other faction. The
leaders at the village level also used the occasion to build up and
consolidate their own following for the forthcoming elections to the
village panchayats and cooperative societies.

The elections in Shirdi indicate that in spite of adult franchise
and widespread politicization over the last twenty years, the political
parties have not succeeded in creating any lasting sense of loyalty
among either the leaders or the followers. Faced with a choice
between loyalty to the party and to the faction or factional leaders,
people often tend to choose the latter.

Why are political parties so weak while loyalties to factions
strong? The answer to this question is to be found in the organization
and operation of the political parties and factions. There are
several questions relevant to the discussion of the functioning of
political parties. How do the parties recruit their followers? What
kind of interest does a party stand for? How are these interests
articulated and aggregated? What are the resources and skills at
the disposal of parties? How are they used in gaining power,
which is the ultimate aim of all political parties? Similar questions
could be asked about the factions also.

The Congress is the oldest party in Maharashtra with the largest
number of followers, and its command over resources and skills is
greater than that of others. The party derives its strength mainly
from the control of various centres of power, such as the Panchayati
Raj institutions and the cooperative societies of various kinds which
are often used as 'political instruments'. It also derives its strength
from a band of peasant leaders in villages who help the people in
solving their day-to-day problems by using their influence with the
various Government agencies and officials. Each such leader builds
up a following. Those who derive benefits feel more obliged to the
leader than to the party. That is one reason why people continue
to stand by the leader even when he leaves the party. Rohmare
created a sense of obligation among a large number of people when
he was controlling the _DCC_ Bank. He continued to do so by
distributing patronage through the Cooperative Sale--Purchase
Union. The control of the Bank later passed on to the rival group
in the district. Kale did not control the Bank directly, as the
Chairman and the Vice-Chairman were outside the Kopargaon
taluka. The people of Kopargaon taluka nostalgically remember
the days when Rohmare was its Chairman and they could get their
work done promptly. The loss of Kopargaon's control over the
Bank was felt by the people and it created some sympathy for the
Rohmare _gat_.

The entry of diverse political elements belonging to the opposition
parties into the Congress party after 1960 has further accentuated
factionalism in the party. The success of the party largely
depends upon containing these diverse and sometimes mutually
antagonistic groups within it. The weaknesses arising out of this
situation are exposed during a crisis. The individuals and groups
which are held together in the party by the single interest of sharing
power leave the party without much hesitation, the moment this
interest is threatened.

The elections convincingly showed that the other parties in
the area, being much less influential than the Congress, were forced
to take cognizance of the factions within it and seek an accommodation
with them to further their own interests. Such accommodation
was accomplished, as in the case of the Jan Sangh and the
_PSP_, often against the declared policy of the party at the national
level. As compared to them the Republican Party has a moro
loyal though narrow base of support. It is also divided into a
number of factions. Nevertheless, the party has a complete hold
over the Mahars. This is its source of strength as well as weakness.
It has become a single-caste party, although perhaps Ambedkar
wanted to avoid its degeneration into a caste party when he changed
its name. It has not attracted any followers from the other castes.
When a Republican candidate contested for a general seat, as
Roham did, he stood no chance of winning against the numerically
and otherwise powerful Maratha or other caste candidates. This
has a frustrating effect on the rank and file of the party and makes
it easy for a candidate such as Gade to split their vote.

The weakness of political parties is also the strength of factions.
The factions in Kopargaon and elsewhere in the area function as
power groups. Intense factional rivalry arises mainly from the
struggle for power. It is the desire to wield and share power and to
distribute patronage which is the basis of factionalism. The elections
in Shirdi revealed the strength of factional loyalties and the
weakness of the organization of political parties. It appears that a
high degree of politicization accompanied by a weak party system
would lead to a 'parochialization' of national issues.
