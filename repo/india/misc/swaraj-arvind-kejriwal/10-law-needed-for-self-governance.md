# LAW NEEDED FOR SELF GOVERNANCE OF VILLAGES

For people to take decisions under the aegis of _gram sabhas_ following changes will have to be brought
about in our legislation so that people will have control over their fate and their lives. They would then
be responsible for their own progress.

## _Gram sabhas_ should be supreme

\

The Problem

\

In the present system _gram sabhas_ have been given very little power and the power that is given vests
with the _sarpanch_ or head of the _panchayat_. This association of people on village level has no control
over the actions of _sarpanch_. In most of the laws enacted for _gram sabhas_, their role is limited to giving
advice to the _sarpanch_. The _sarpanch_ has the option of accepting or rejecting the advice. Therefore,
people suck up to the _sarpanch_. This makes the _sarpanch_ autocratic and corrupt. The people of _gram
sabha_, in absence of any power to question his actions, stand by as helpless spectators. Since they are
unable to take any action, the people of _gram sabhas_ have distanced themselves from the day to day
working of the _gram sabhas_.

Law has not given any power to the people of _gram sabha_ to make amends if the _sarpanch_ is taking
wrong decisions or is indulging in corrupt practices. The district administrator however, has the right to
take action against the _sarpanch_. Each district administrator has about one thousand _village panchayats_
under him. District administrator is located in a city far away from villages. He has no clue to the
functioning of _sarpanch_ of a _panchayat_. When villagers make complaint against the _sarpanch_ then in
most cases no action is initiated against the _sarpanch_ because the district administrator has no time for
them. If the _Sarpanch_ belongs to the ruling party or has affiliation with the local M.P., MLA or a leader
then the administrator under their influence does not bother to initiate any inquiry. In this way no
action is taken against the erring _sarpanch_.

Since there are more than thousand villages under the administrator, he assigns the work of supervising
the _sarpanch_ to the block development officers (BDO) or some junior officials. These officials in turn
indulge in extorting money from the _sarpanch_. If a _sarpanch_, who is honest, refuses to pay then the
BDO's and junior officers initiate inquiries of false cases against the _sarpanch_. The BDO's and junior
officials with the power vested in them to take action against the _sarpanch_, coerce the _sarpanch_ to toe
their line and make him part of the corrupt practices. This happens in connivance with the district
_collector_ who, either on his own volition or under the pressure of political masters blesses the actions of
his junior officers. This platform of coercion is both used for siphoning off the government funds and to
spread political influence of a party. "Do as directed" or an action will be taken against you becomes the
rule for the _sarpanch_ of a village.

\

_Suggestion_

\

The first step is to free this _sarpanch_ from the clutches of the district administrator and make him
accountable to the people directly. Our suggestions are as follows.

a. The _gram sabha_ should be given the power to take all decisions. Their decisions should be final
and the role of _sarpanch_ should be limited to implementing the decisions.
b. If a _sarpanch_ is found to be indulging in embezzling funds or in criminal acts or in corrupt
practices then the _gram sabha_ should have power to direct the police to register a first
Information report (FIR) against the accused _sarpanch_. The progress report of the action taken
against the _sarpanch_ should be placed before the _gram sabha_ on regular basis.
c. Unless, the _gram sabha_ specifically requests for an action against the _sarpanch_, the district
administrator or any other officer should have no power to take any action against a _sarpanch_.
d. In case a _sarpanch_ does not follow the wishes of the _gram sabha_ then _gram sabha_ should have
the power to recall this _sarpanch_. If more than 50% people pass a vote of "No
confidence" against the _sarpanch_ and send it over to the election commission then the
commission should verify the signatures within fifteen days. Within thirty days of verification of
signatures a secret ballot should take place against the impeachment. If "No confidence" vote is
won with majority then that _sarpanch_ should be removed from his post and a new _sarpanch_
should be installed with fresh mandate of the people.

Recall of _sarpanch_ is a sure shot formula that should be used as a last resort. There are several
states where this right to recall has been bestowed on people of _gram sabhas_. Many villages in
these states have used this power. Unfortunately there are no remedies for an in between
situations. Either you have a _sarpanch_ or you recall him. There are no provisions, where the
people could direct him time to time and force him to take corrective actions. As soon as the
process of removing a _sarpanch_ starts, the wheels of local politics come into motion. This local
politics is then supported by the realignment of politics on the state level that leads to a lot of
undesirable corrupt practices. Because of this an honest debate becomes impossible on the
proposed "No confidence motion".

We believe, if the _gram sabhas_ get all kinds of power to take decisions of amendment, advice with which
they could direct the _sarpanch_ from time to time. Then it would not become necessary to remove the
_sarpanch_. In such a case he will be an equal partner in the joint process of taking a decision at every
stage. It is believed that there will be no need to use ultimate weapon "Recall".

## Projects on Village level should be under villages

\

_Problem_

\

In today's establishment there is confusion on the jurisdiction of works, resources and organization.

\

_Suggestion_

\

In earlier part of the book it was mentioned that lists should be created of all the works, resources and
organizations under whose jurisdiction they fall. After this these assets should be transferred under the
jurisdiction of respective village or block or the district level of administration. The funds required to
operate and maintain or execute works along with the government officials should also be allocated to
that level only.

## Control over Government employees

\

_Problem_

\

People have no control over the acts of omission and commission by the government employees and
find themselves in a helpless situation.

\

_Suggestion_

\

a. The control over the government employees, both administrative and operational, connected
with execution of works, maintenance of properties and their organizations should be passed on
to various levels of _panchayats_. The employees should be considered as employees of the
_panchayat_ under which they have been transferred. When employed employees retire then the
new appointment should be made by the _panchayat_ under which the vacancies fall. State
government should play no role in new appointments.
b. On all levels _panchayats_ should have the powers to appoint new employees to fulfill its needs.
These employees should be treated as employees of the _panchayat_ and not employees of the
State Government.
c. The _panchayats_ should have complete administrative control over the employees irrespective of
the fact that they were transferred from elsewhere or were appointed by the _panchayat_
directly. _Gram sabha_ should have power to charge sheet an employee, also be able to punish an
erring employee and suspend him, if the need arises.
d. _Gram sabhas_ should have power to cancel the license of an essential commodity dealer like,
kerosene or ration or gas, if found engaging in malpractices and appoint a new dealer.
e. All _gram sabhas_ should be empowered to issue directive to any government employee and if
need arises then send him a summon asking him to be present in the meetings of the sabhas. If
the directive of a _gram sabha_ is not in conflict with the directive of a different _gram sabha_ then
it should be mandatory for the concerned employee to obey the directives issued by the _gram
sabha_. (Note: Sometimes an employee is on the block level and responsible for looking after
works related to a block instead of a village). In case of conflict, it should be resolved on that
level of the _panchayat_. In case an employee ignores a summon sent by a _gram sabha_ or defies
the orders issued by it, then the _gram sabha_ should be empowered to reprimand the employee
and impose a fine on him, too.

## Control over government funds

\

_Problem_

\

The Central and State Governments conceive many illogical plans and projects that have nothing to do
with primary needs of the people. These plans are conduits for siphoning off the money, increase
corruption and have no relevance to the needs of the people. They are digressive in nature and
encourage people to sloth and laziness. This has been discussed earlier in the book.

\

_Suggestion_

\

In our opinion all these grandiose schemes should be abandoned herewith. Most of the funds that are
made available to the _panchayats_ should not be tied to any scheme. The fund should be a _free fund_
available at the disposal of the _gram sabha_, to be disposed off in a fashion that the _gram sabha_ desires.

The State Government of Kerala transfers 40% of its annual budget fund directly to _gram sabhas_. The
need of the day is that at least 50% of the annual budget of all the states, should be sanctioned and
distributed to the _gram sabhas_ as _free fund_. There should be no caveat attached with the fund and _gram
sabhas_ should be free to use this fund for development in a way they think is best for them.

For release of fund, in today's time, _panchayats_ face problem and many a times are forced to pay bribes
to senior officers of the government. On first April of every year money is transferred in the accounts at
various levels of _panchayat_ in Kerala. This is how the funds should be transferred every year to all
_panchayats_, thereby, removing all difficulties faced by the _gram sabhas_ in getting the fund.

If a group, belonging to backward section of society in a particular village, puts up a demand then a part
of the fund from the main fund of the _gram sabha_ should be sanctioned to that group for their needs.
This will ensure that muscle men of the village do not have undue power over the backward classes.

## Control over Block and _district panchayats_

\

_Problem_

\

In the present system _gram sabhas_ work under the middle level and district levels of _panchayats_. The
proposals of _gram panchayats_ are approved by the middle level _panchayats_. Mostly the payment of
works carried out on the village _panchayat_ levels are made by the middle and district level _panchayats_.
However, there is no control of _gram sabhas_ over the working of the middle and district levels of _gram
panchayats_.

\

_Suggestion_

\

a. The proposals made and decisions taken by the _gram sabhas_, for their village, should be final.
The _gram sabhas_ do not have to take approval from anyone on financial or administrative or any
other matter.
b. The government will have to take permission to start a scheme from each of the _gram sabhas_
that are affected by it. Also any _gram sabha_ can give suggestion to start a new scheme to its
block or district _panchayat_. In general a plan should be implemented by the government only
when it has been approved by all the affected _gram sabhas_ in that area.
c. Role of _Sarpanch_ of a village is merely to act like a bridge between _gram sabha_ and the _block
panchayat_. Before making any commitment to the district _panchayat_ the _sarpanch_ will have to
consult and take permission from the _gram sabha_. In the same way the block _sarpanch_ is a
bridge between _block panchayat_ and the district _panchayat_. He too will have to take the
permission from the affected _block panchayats_ before making any commitment to the district
_panchayat_. _Gram sabha_, if so desires, can give the option to the _sarpanch_ of not taking
permission from the _gram sabha_ on certain matters. This option should be to a limited extent
only.

## Direct control over policy formation and state assemblies

\

_Problem_

\

We are a Democracy In India. Although we elect our representatives but we have no control over the
representative between two successive elections spread over a period of five years. We have no control
over the formulation of laws enacted by the State and Central Governments. It is being observed that in
last many years the government is enacting such laws that are detrimental to the welfare of its citizens.
Many laws are enacted to benefit both national and international business houses under the pressure of
foreign governments. There is a need to put an effective control over it.

\

_Suggestions_

\

The people should have certain control over the process of formulating laws in the parliament. This
control could be given in two ways.

a. The role of citizens in enactment of new policies and laws

If more than 5% of the _gram sabhas_ moot a proposal to formulate a policy then the
State Government should forward the proposal to all _gram sabhas_. If more than 50% of
the _gram sabhas_ endorse the proposal then it is obligatory on the part of the State Governments
to enact the proposal into a law or a policy. In the same way the _gram sabhas_ should have the
power to partly or wholly reject or amend a law or a policy. They should also have the power to
amend or cancel a scheme of the government.

This way the citizens will initiate a new chapter in the process of reforms. These could be
reforms in the police department or reforms related to judicial system, or enactment of
powerful laws against corruption. This will usher in a new era of citizens participation in the
government functioning.

b. The opinion of the citizens in tabled proposals for formulating all laws and policies in the state
assemblies and the parliament.

As per the constitution, elected representative are the installed members in parliament and the
legislative assemblies of states. In the same way block and district _panchayat_ officials are the
members of the _panchayat_. As per law they have not been given any work.

A law should be enacted that a copy of all the proposals and bills that are tabled in the
parliament ( besides the finance bill and no confidence motion) be brought to the district or
_block panchayat_ and distribute the same to the representatives of all _gram sabhas_ and resident
welfare associations in the cities. These laws or bills then should be discussed and dissected in
the _gram sabhas_ and the Resident Welfare Associations in the cities. Only after receiving a
consensus opinion they should put them up in the parliament for voting.

## Right to Information by the _gram sabhas_

\

_Problem_

\

There are many decisions that are taken by the State and Central Governments that affect
directly the lives of its citizens.

\

_Suggestions_

\

_Gram sabhas_ must get the right to seek information, from any of the government officials of the
state that directly or indirectly affects his village. If the official fails to give the information then
_gram sabha_ should have the power to imposed a fine of rupees twenty five thousand on this erring
official.

## Control over the _panchayat secretary_

\

_Problem_

\

The _secretary_ of the _panchayat_ is appointed by the State Government. He in collusion with _sarpanch_
and other officials fosters corruption. He is not at all accountable to the people and therefore, the
people have no control over him.

\

_Suggestion_

\

The appointment of _panchayat secretary_ should be done by the _gram sabha_. His role should be
limited to implementing the decisions of the _gram sabha_. _Gram sabhas_ should have complete
control over him, which includes power to punish the _secretary_, stop his salary and if the need be
power to suspend him from the post.

## Issues of corruption in _panchayats_

\

_Problem_

\

Corruption has seeped into all government works. Payments are made not only for works of
extremely cheap quality but also for non existing works which are only shown on papers. When the
citizens make complaint no action is taken. There are two reasons behind this.

a. Whenever a government work takes place, the verification of the work is carried out by a
government official that the work has been carried out as per specification and, therefore, the
payment should be released. The citizens or the _gram sabhas_ are not involved in this process of
verification. In Uttar Pradesh the SDM verifies that a canal has been cleaned properly. Many a
times he just accepts a bribe and gives a verification certificate in spite of the fact that the
cleaning has not even taken place. No body bothers to ask the farmers who use the canal water
if the same is cleaned or not.
b. When complaint is lodged against these officials with their senior officer, the inquiry is
conducted by the officers of vigilance department. Under political pressure, or by accepting
bribes or just because of carelessness they do not take any action. The citizens on the other
hand have no control over these vigilance officers.

\

_Suggestions_

\

In our view on the above mentioned issues the _gram sabha_ should be given the following powers.

a. Unless _gram sabha_ has given a certificate of satisfaction of the executed work of the
government, no payment should be made to the contractor who has carried out the work. In
case the work is of poor quality then the _gram sabha_ should also have power to initiate an
inquiry into the works. The tainted contractor should be black listed and orders should be
passed to correct the deficiency in the works. If guilty officials, responsible for the work, are
under the jurisdiction of the _gram sabhas_ then _gram sabhas_ should have power to take action
against them.
b. If corruption is of criminal nature then _gram sabha_ must be empowered to direct the police to
register an FIR and give regular reports on the progress of their inquiry.

## Alcoholism in Villages

\

_Problem_

\

In present time license for opening a liquor shop is given by the government departments on the
recommendations of political leaders. They normally accept bribes for giving that permission.
Serious problems crop up because of liquor shops. Many families are destroyed by the habit of
alcoholism. The irony is that no one takes the opinion of people whose lives are affected in the
vicinity of the shop. The shop is thrust on them, whether they want it or not.

\

_Suggestion_

\

The license to open a shop should be given, only when the permission is granted by the _gram sabha_
in whose jurisdiction the shop falls. This permission of _gram sabha_ must have the consent of 90% of
the women of the _gram sabha_. By a majority vote, the women of the _gram sabha_ also should have
power to get the license of an existing shop cancelled.

## License for Industry and mining

\

_Problem_

\

State and the Central Government issue license for Industry and mining. But people residing in the
areas have to bear the brunt of its adverse effects. There is no role that these people play in the
process of issue of license.

\

_Suggestion_

\

No permission should be granted for large industry set up and mining without the consent of the
people of that area. The _gram sabhas_ could grant the permission with certain conditions. In case
these conditions are not met with, then the _gram sabhas_ should have the power to cancel the
permission, if given earlier.

## Land acquisition

\

_Problem_

\

a. Land is acquired by various state agencies from the people for various projects and Industry
without considering the opinion of the affected people. Not only people loose their home and
hearth but also face unemployment. The compensation paid in lieu of the land is inadequate.
Even if the rates are paid as per the prevailing market prices, then also the people's problem are
not lessened. We are merely taking an example that an acre of land is sufficient for a farmer to
grow crop year after year and take care of his needs for a life time but rupee forty or fifty
thousand that is paid as compensation is not sufficient to take care of his expenses for a life
time. Such acquisition alleviates poverty.
b. Though the land owner gets an inadequate compensation but the labour who was working on
that land does not get anything. He faces the specter of unemployment and poverty.
c. In many a places it has been observed that when the land was acquired, under duress, from the
villagers then they joined the violent ranks of the _Naxals_.

\

_Suggestion_

\

_Gram sabhas_ should be empowered to take decision on suitability of a project whether it is for the
welfare of the people of the area or not, whether the land should be given for the project or not. If it
is decided the land should be given for the project then at what rate and conditions. There opinion
of _gram sabhas_ should be supreme. To give these power following provisions should be made in the
laws.

a. If any company, central or State Government is interested in acquiring land then it should send
an application to the _panchayat_ of the concerned village.
b. Original papers should be submitted, duly translated in the local language explaining how the
acquired land will be used and what kind of project will be put up. The papers should be
submitted to all _gram sabha_ & _panchayats_ that are affected to enable them evaluate various pros
and cons of the acquisition.
c. Based on the information submitted to the _panchayat_ a campaign should be organized in each
village to make people aware of the land acquisition. If any person of the village wants a photo
copy of the project then a photocopy should be made available to him after charging money for
the same.
d. After giving papers to the _village panchayats_, each _panchayat_ should call a meeting to discuss
the project. If there are doubts and fears about the project then the _gram panchayats_ would
send in a request to the company, central or State Government which is putting up the project to
appoint their representative to give answers to their doubts and fears in the _gram sabha_. If
more information is needed then _gram sabha_ could request for the same.
e. In the next meeting, which would be attended by the representative of the acquiring agency, all
doubts and fears would be put to discussions. No decision would be taken on acquisition, except
question answer session in this meeting.
f. If the _gram sabha_ is satisfied with documents furnished and the answers of the representative
then _gram sabha_ will call another meeting for taking the decision on the acquisition issue. In
case it requires more information then it would send in a request to the company, State
Government or the Central Government.
g. The meeting, in which the _gram sabha_ takes the final decision, no outsider would be allowed
like the company representative, state or Central Government representative and the police.
Even the media would be kept at a distance from the meeting. This meeting would not be
chaired by the gram _sarpanch_ or the _pradhan_. The people of the _gram sabha_ will choose, with
consensus, a respectable person amongst themselves to head this meeting. The minutes of the
meeting would not be written by the _secretary_ of the _gram sabha_ but by a person chosen from
amongst the people present.

A vote would be taken to decide if the people want to give away the land or not. If yes then on
what terms and conditions? The _gram sabha_ will ensure that interest of all concerned is taken
care of while taking unanimous decision. This _sabha_ will take care of the interest of the landless
and the labours who work on the land and the acquisition would result in their unemployment.

If need be then more than one _gram sabhas_ should conduct meetings jointly to reach a
consensus.

h. Whatever is the decision taken by such a consensus would rein supreme. The government will
have no power to make amendments or reject the same.
i. There should be a national policy on rehabilitation of the land owners and landless which should
clearly define their basic rights. If the _gram sabha_ gives consent to land acquisition then
provisions laid down in the rehabilitation policy, without tempering the basic rights, would form
the basis of acquisition. The _gram sabhas_ on the other hand will be free to negotiate other terms
and demand more. The decision of the _gram sabha_ will be treated as final.
j. The country is passing through a great food crisis. This crisis would deepen in the times to come.
It is important in the national interest to preserve fertile land for the purpose of agriculture only.
The nation will survive without roads, power and industry but we will not be able to survive for a
day without food. A law should be enacted that bans the use of land that yields two crops a year
for any purpose other than agriculture. Such land should be identified and marked for
agriculture use only by the _gram sabhas_.

## Land records

\

_Problem_

\

The land records are tempered by the local officials of the government on a large scale through
fraud. There are many cases of fraud and of collusion of these government officials who have
transferred the land belonging to poor and helpless farmers in the name of someone else.
Besides this, it is a gigantic task to ferret out information related to a property from the land
revenue department. Getting work out of this department is even more difficult.

\

_Suggestion_

\

All the documents pertaining to land, under the supervision of _gram sabhas_, should be taken
care off by the office of _gram panchayat_. The list of all property transfer should be promulgated
by the _gram sabhas_ on a monthly basis. Any inquiry made by an individual or a society must be
answered within a stipulated time by the _gram sabha_. Failing to adhere to the time lines, the
concerned officials of _gram sabha_ should be fined suitably.

## Control over natural resources

\

_Problem_

\

For centuries the local population was using limited natural resources for their needs and also
preserving the environment. The control of natural resources like forest, rivers and mines
started from the time British established rule in the country. From that time the exploitation
started of these natural resources while the local population was displaced. However, the
situation did not change after the independence. In last few years the process of exploitation of
natural resources has increased where the land of the locals whose life depended on these was
snatched from them. It has been mentioned earlier that the government is selling these natural
resources to business houses and contractors at throw away prices.

\

_Suggestion_

\

The _gram sabhas_ should be made the owner of all small water resources, forests, minerals that
fall under the jurisdiction of the _gram sabha_. It should also be ensured that without the consent
of the concerned _gram sabhas_ no one is given the lease to use the water resources, forests,
mines and land. The _gram sabhas_ will decide who should be given the lease to use or not to use
the natural resources and at what terms and conditions. If the terms and conditions of the
contract of lease for the use of these resources are violated, in future by a contractor, then the
_gram sabhas_ should have the power to cancel the lease of such a contractor. If such violations
have caused damage to environment or to group of people then the contracting company
should be made to pay damages.

It has been mentioned earlier in the book that natural resources are the national property of the
country. How that should be deployed for national and general welfare is a question that needs
to be discussed on all levels of the _gram sabha_ to create a national policy. The _gram sabhas_ then
could use these policies as a basis to give permission for use of the natural resources in their
areas.

## Corruption in Government offices

\

_Problem_

\

Be it a passport office or an office of the municipality, revenue department or the office of the
SDM the citizens face all kinds of problems and are forced to give bribes to get their work done.
It could be driving license or a birth certificate, it could be a death certificate or verification of
land records, it could be complaint for a blocked drain or an application for getting electrical
power, a citizen is forced to pay bribes to the government officials.

\

_Suggestion_

\

Verification certificates for cast, income, residence proof etc should be issued by the _panchayat_
office. In case if the _panchayat secretary_ shows lack in his duty then he should be called to the
_gram sabha_ for questioning. In any case the _gram sabha_ has the power to reprimand and
penalize the secretary for his acts of disobedience.

Passports, driving licenses, electricity and water connections should be given to citizens within a
specified time after receiving an application. If time lines are not met then the concerned official
should be fined suitably.

## Collection of taxes

\

_Problem_

\

We use unscientific methods to collect and spend the taxes. Most of the taxes are collected by
the State and Central Governments. These taxes are used through various plans and schemes of
the government for the states, towns and villages. The money gets siphoned on two levels.

One at the level when it is being collected that is on the upwards journey to the government
treasury and then when the money is spent that is on its downward journey. What is surprising
that the collected taxes on the local levels are not spent on the local level. The people are
totally ignorant as to where collected taxes have been used?

\

_Suggestion_

\

Experience suggests that if people are made to participate in the process of collection of taxes
and if they know how these taxes will be used for their benefit then collection of taxes will
become much easier.

As far as is possible the services of the gram sabhhas should be taken for collection of various
types of taxes. _Gram sabha_ is primary unit of the conglomeration of people for whom the taxes
would be used for collective benefit. There can be no agency, government or otherwise, better
than the _gram sabha_ itself to carry out this task. Our suggestions are as follows.

State governments should make list of various type of taxes.

a. List of those taxes that are imposed and collected by the State Government.
b. Those taxes that would be imposed by the State Government but the collection would be on
the direction of _gram panchayat_.
c. Those taxes that would be imposed by the higher levels of _panchayats_ but would be
collected by lower levels of _panchayats_.
d. Those taxes that are imposed and collected by the same level of _panchayats_. An effort
should be made that most of the taxes should fall in this category so that each level of
_panchayat_ could become financially independent.
e. Income generated out of the wealth of _gram sabha_ should be credited in the account of that
_gram sabhas_ only. Part of the duties imposed by the Agriculture Produce Marketing
Committee (APMC) at the market place should also be credited to the concerned
_panchayats_. We would mention here that both buyer and seller have to pay taxes to the
APMC. Where and how this tax is spent is not known to anybody.

## Consolidation of many villages under one _panchayat_

\

_Problem_

\

Presently many far flung villages are clubbed together under one _panchayat_. The people of the
village are not able to attend the meetings of the sabhas. These villages are different from each
other on the basis of caste, creed, and religion, their economic and social differences. It has
been seen that their problems and solutions are also different. Many villages have enmity that
dates back to many generations. The villages are not connected with roads or railway that
creates problems of commuting for attending the _gram sabhas_. Taking all the above issues
under consideration their consolidation on one level is unworkable.

\

_Suggestion_

\

Irrespective of the size of the village, each village should be declared as a _panchayat_. If two or
more villages want to consolidate under a single unit then they should be declared as a unit of
_panchayat_. Under PESA such provisions are available for the backward classes. The same law
should be extended to the entire country.

## Consolidation of _panchayat_ on block and district level

\

_Problem_

\

In today's system the _sarpanch_ of a village in lower levels of _panchayat_ is a member of the
higher level of _panchayat_. Besides this, election is conducted for members of block and district
levels of _panchayat_. The past records of the working of the _panchayat_ show that there is no
improvement in the working methodology of the _panchayat_ because of this. This methodology
on the other hand has fueled corruption. Whenever, there is a proposal of "No confidence
motion " against the chairperson of the middle and district level of _panchayat_ then the existing
members start to bid their prices for their vote to support or reject the "No confidence motion".
In many a cases the chairperson pays the members on a regular basis to remain in office. The
Chairpersons of higher levels of _panchayat_, during election, spend a lot more money than the
members spend in their election, since their area of operation is much wider. This money,
needless to say is amassed from corrupt practices from various government projects that come
under their jurisdiction, once they are in office.

\

_Suggestion_

\

Election for the post of members of middle and district level of _panchayat_ should be abolished.
The representatives of the lower level of _panchayats_ should be made members of the higher
levels of _panchayat_. This way the lower level of _panchayats_ would be able to control the working
of higher levels of _panchayats_. All _sarpanch_ of a village should be made members of the _block
panchayat_. They should elect one member amongst themselves as the block chairperson. In the
same way chairpersons of each block should elect one member as the chairperson of the district
_panchayat_. The _sarpanch_ of the _gram sabha_ should act as a bridge between the village and the
block. He should inform the _block panchayat_ of all the decisions taken by the _gram sabha_ and in
turn inform the _gram sabhas_ of the decisions taken by the _block panchayat_.

This way, through the _sarpanch_ of their village, the _gram sabha_ will be able to take control of
the activities of the block _gram sabha_. By extending this system the block chairpersons will act
as a conduit and will be able to take control of the activities of the district level of _panchayats_.

## Transparency in documents

\

_Problem_

\

In spite of Right to Information act it is difficult to obtain information about the working
methodology and decisions made by the various levels of the _panchayats_. In many areas where
people have asked information related to working of _panchayat_ from the _sarpanch_ and the
government officials, many cases have come to light where the people have been victimized. It
is a common occurrence where the _sarpanch_ in collusion with the police has registered false
cases against such people. At many a places people have been attacked with intent to kill.

\

_Suggestion_

\

To bring about transparency in the working of all levels of the _panchayat_, the documents related
to works should be available freely. All documents related to gram, block and _district panchayats_
should be available for scrutiny. Such a system should be devised where any one could inspect
documents related to works without giving an application. For such purpose two days in week
should be reserved for a limited time in which this inspection could be carried out by common
man. If some one demands a copy of any document, than he should get the photo copy of the
document within seven days after paying the necessary charges. In case of any violation, the
_gram sabha_ should have the power to punish the erring government employee.

## Introduction of _Lokpal_

There is endemic corruption rooting out of a basic problem that there is no accountability of a
government servant or an elected representatives of the people. This gives freedom to both
elected representatives and government servants to indulge in acts of financial embezzlement
of funds that belong to the people. The courts are already reeling under the pressure of
mounting cases that are pending with them and many times it takes a life time for a case to
come to a conclusion. Justice delayed is justice denied.

Therefore, _Lokpal bill_ is being proposed. This is an independent institution, which will look into
cases of corruption against the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary. _Lokpal_ will look into
corruption cases against the Central Government employees and the _Lokayukta_ will look into
corruption cases against the employees of the State Governments.

_Lokpal_ is within the frame work of transparency in operation. _Lokpal_ is subservient to the people
and not above. Just the way people give executive power to the _Lokpal_/_Lokayukta_ to act against
the dishonest government employees, in the same way _Lokpal_'s office is also subject to scrutiny.
People will have the power to recall _Lokpal_, if _Lokpal_ is found to be corrupt.

\

_Problem_

\

There is no effective remedy in the existing law if provisions of the _panchayat_ law are being
violated. Like the working of _gram sabha_ is thwarted, certain section of society members are not
being allowed to attend _gram sabha_ meetings, the minutes of the meeting are not being
recorded properly. Under such circumstances district officials are supposed to take action but
they under the influence of the local political leaders do not conduct an impartial inquiry.

Fears are expressed that influential people from higher castes in many areas will not let the
people from backward class attend the meetings of the _gram sabha_. Even if they are allowed
then they will not be given chance to voice their opinion. Even if they are allowed to express
their opinion and demands then the recording in the minutes of the meeting would not be
included.

\

_Suggestion_

\

Therefore, it is suggested that to listen to such complaints and take time bound actions _Lokpal_
should be appointed. In Kerala such a system is in operation with positive results.

It is suggested that _Lokpal_ should be appointed on the state level. The work of _Lokpal_ would be
to solve problems related to violation of _gram panchayat_'s laws and disputes. The _Lokpal_ will
also take steps to implement various provisions of the _gram panchayat_ law.

The selection process of _Lokpal_ should be totally transparent and should be by general
participation of the people. In order for it to be effective and time bound, it should be given all
necessary rights and resources.

If someone reports that the meetings of _gram sabhas_ are not taking place regularly or some
sections of society are not allowed to attend the meeting or not allowed to voice their opinion,
or the minutes of the meeting are not being recorded properly then it will be _Lokpal_'s duty to
conduct an inquiry into it. If it is found that there is truth in such a report then either he himself
or through his representative arrange _gram sabha_ and makes sure that such incidents do not
take place and meetings are conducted regularly.

## Ban on interference of the State Government

\

_Problem_

\

Under the present system of _panchayati raj_, the State Governments send directives to the
_panchayats_ all the time. Because of this the _panchayats_ have turned into a useless government
departments processing paper. Instead of tackling the problems of the people of their areas the
_sarpanchs_ are busy in taking care of the directives of the government. The directives pertain to
the date when the _gram sabha_ will take place, what will be the agenda of the meeting, what all
committees will be formed and how will they be formed and how will they operate? All such
decisions are taken in the secretariat of the State Governments, located in capital cities, instead
of the _gram sabhas_. The State Governments try to take all small and big decisions related to lives
of the people of the village. This has resulted in indifferent attitude of members in the work of
_sabha_, in loss of freedom of the _gram sabhas_ and its _panchayats_.

It probably is believed by the government that people on the village level need spoon feeding
and if left to them then it will result in a state of chaos. They will not be able to take decision on
the issues of education, health care, warehousing products, irrigation and many others in their
villages. This is a far fetched thought because there are plenty of examples where villagers have
proven that they could administer, if given a free hand.

It is the business of Government to govern but government displays inept and shoddy handling
of the administration. It interferes with peoples lives on all levels small and big. Result is that
people take no initiative in the process of governance and governance, therefore, is no ones
baby; neither of the people or of the government.

\

_Suggestion_

\

The right to give direction to the _gram sabha_ should be withdrawn from the State Government.
_Panchayats_ should be treated as the third independent body of administration. State
governments should be allowed to send directives to the _panchayats_ once in a while but sending
in directives on a regular basis and interfering in _panchayat_'s day to day activities must be
stopped.

Let the people decide what they want. Let them decide what their priorities are and how they
would like to deal with the problems that they face. Once they are given freedom to choose,
freedom to operate and free funds, they will excel in governing themselves.
