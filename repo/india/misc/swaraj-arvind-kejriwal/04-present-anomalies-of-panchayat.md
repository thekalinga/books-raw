# PRESENT ANOMALIES OF _PANCHAYATI RAJ_

There is nothing new; the people argue that the _panchayats_ exists even now. Through the _panchayati raj_
the villagers are connected with the government. The anomaly is that after independence in the name
of _panchayati raj_ the kind of set up that is created fosters corruption because it gives the rights and
power to the political leaders, government officers instead of people.

Instead of strengthening the administration on the village level, unfortunately _panchayats_ have become
a conduit of implementing various schemes of State Government. The schemes are made either in the
center or in the capitals of State Governments. _Panchayats_ are given orders to only implement them.
These schemes sometimes have no relevance to ambitions and aspirations of the people.

There are many anomalies in the _panchayati raj_ administration. Broadly the following strangulate the
system's capabilities.

1. _Panchayats_ have very few rights and powers. There is no control what so ever of the _panchayats_
   on government employees and government funds.
2. Whatever rights that have been given to the _panchayats_, vest with the _pradhan_ or the _sarpanch_.
   The _Sarpanch_ is the soul of the _panchayat_. All decisions are taken by him. _Gram sabhas_ (or
   people) have no right to veto his decision. In the _gram sabha_ can give suggestion to the
   _sarpanch_. However, the _sarpanch_ is free to either accept or reject their advice.
3. Therefore, most of the _sarpanchs_ have become corrupt. And the people are not empowered to
   take any action against them.
4. Only the _Collector_ has been empowered to take action against an incompetent, irresponsible
   and corrupt _sarpanch_. The _Collector_ can initiate any action against the _sarpanch_. He can also
   suspend him. Therefore, most of the _sarpanchs_ are scared of the _Collector_ and the Block
   Development Officer, who is a subordinate of the _Collector_. The _Collector_ of a district is an
   employee of the State Government, in much the same way as the Governor is an employee of
   the Central Government. Fortunately, the Governor does not have any rights to interfere in the
   affairs of the State Government. Unfortunately, the _Collector_ has unlimited power to interfere in
   the affairs of the State Government. The State Governments, therefore, through the _Collector_
   interferes in the affairs of the _gram sabha_ or the people.

Let us see some of the anomalies of the present _Panchayati Raj_.

## Tree Plantation Campaign in Bhondsi Village

In a village people need water for irrigation and drinking, health services and hospitals, schools and
colleges, electricity and many more. As it was mentioned before, every aspect of life and living is
controlled by a government department. Each department functions independently. The road
department has no connection with the sanitation department. Health department has no connection
with the education department. The water department has no connection with the horticulture
department. Each department has certain milestones to achieve during one financial year.

The village of Bhondsi near Delhi had very few trees, so the forest department was given the task of
planting trees. The work was not carried out properly. It was handled by inept and inefficient employees
of the government and the target was nowhere near completion. To complete the target in a short time
seeds were sprinkled over large tract of land from a helicopter. The seeds were of Keekar tree that
grows very fast. The forest department had to show that they have been able to plant a forest. The
forest department did not bother that Keekar consumes a lot of water which it sucks from its land. The
water table fell drastically in Bhondsi disrupting the water management.

There was no participation of the people of Bhondsi. No suggestions were taken from the people to find
what kind of trees should be planted. _Panchayat_ or the people have no control over any decision of any
department whether good or bad.

## Garbage in the City of Kutumbakum

Kutumbakum is a village near Chennai. The Tamil Nadu Government was searching land for dumping the
garbage of six neighboring cities. Some bright government officers identified a large tract of land,
measuring about 100 acres, near this village which was used for grazing cattle. About 5000 cattle used to
graze on this land. 70 acres of land was acquired by the order of the _Collector_ of the city. This land was
then used for dumping the refuge of six cities. Needless to mention the villagers of Kutumbakum were
extremely angry. They were neither consulted nor were their wishes of having this land as a grazing
ground given a thought. They had to hunt for fresh grazing ground. The garbage dumped near the
village created a health hazard for the locals. But when the villagers filed a suit against the government,
they lost, because the _collector_ was well within his rights to acquire this land.

Is this what _Panchayati Raj_ is? Where the _panchayat_ has no power, the _sarpanch_ has no power and not
to mention the people have no power. Where the State Government through the _Collector_'s power can
deprive the people of land and create a garbage dump against the wishes of their _gram sabha_, the
_Sarpanch_ and the people. There is no sanity in a system that override the wishes of its people.

## A joke named NREGA

NREGA (National Rural Employment Guarantee) Act guarantees hundred days of wage employment in a financial year to a rural household whose
adult members offer to do unskilled manual work. Thousands of crores have been allotted under this
scheme to various states in the country. Hundreds of cases are coming up small and big where the
wages are being paid to non existing ghost workers. Where the wages have been paid for the work are
less than what should be paid under this scheme or the wages are paid for less number of days and
claimed for hundred days by coterie of government officials right from _district collector_ to BDO to
_Sarpanch_.

4% of the allotted money is known as contingency fund that is specifically used for the welfare
of women and children working under the schemes of NREGA. This 4% is used for providing
water and sanitation for the workers, welfare centres like a cr√®che or a dispensary. In rural areas no
such facilities are ever provided to the poor worker's family. This contingency fund is siphoned off by the
government officials who are connected with NREGA running into hundreds of crores.

Government schemes are formulated at the centre or the state capitals. The funds that are made
available under these schemes flow from top to the bottom. Each official is hell bent on spending money
on his level only. That money which is meant for the welfare of the people at the lowest rung never
reaches them. Every official spends that money on his own level. The poor worker does not know whom
to make a complaint. The tax money paid by honest individuals is thus squandered on such grand
schemes where government has no capability of implementing them.

How can money be siphoned off on all levels is a question that comes to the mind so very often? One of
the biggest reasons is that there is no accountability of any government official. This is what needs to be
corrected.

## _Panchayats_ do not have authority to even buy a broom

If a _Sarpanch_ does not attend _gram sabha_ meetings, is inept and corrupt then the _Collector_ has the
power to take action against the _sarpanch_. He can institute an inquiry or even remove him as _sarpanch_.
But a _collector_ has about thousand to two thousand villages under him and it is impossible for him to
know how good or bad a _sarpanch_ is; whether he is discharging his duties properly or not. On the other
hand the people of the village would. The power to take action against the _sarpanch_ is not given to the
people, when it should be rightfully theirs. Taking advantage of this fact many a _collector_ has become
corrupt and has started the tradition of taking protection money which in hindi is known as "_Hafta_". No
action is taken against the _sarpanchs_ who pay this "_Hafta_", but false cases are initiated against the
_sarpanch_ who resist this protection money. They are forced to tow the line and are made to do what is
not right.

This example gives us an insight into the working of _Panchayati raj_ system where politicians sitting at the
State Government levels can control the _Sarpanch_, the _Pradhan_ and the leader of a village through the
authority of _Collector_ and make them dance to their wishes.

Though a contact is awarded by the U.P. government to supply equipment like pick axe and brooms for
cleaning up villages, the contractor is instructed by the B.D.O. to deliver the material and collect
payment from the _sarpanchs_. If a _sarpanch_ does not make the payment he suffers harassment at the
hands of the B.D.O.

What was shown on the paper was not what had actually happened. The material was paid for by
thousands of _sarpanchs_ but on paper it was the State Government that had bought all the equipment.
This fraudulent activity of the State Government gets buried in the files.

Under the _Education for All_ program, much the same thing is happening all the time in the villages.
The right to buy educational material against this program is under the _Panchayat_. But the same high
handedness is visible here too. It is seen in various districts of Uttar Pradesh that instead of transferring
the allotted money of _Education for All_ to the _Village education fund_, this money is directly used by
the State Government. Contracts are awarded. For example, towards repair and maintenance of
electrical work in all schools directly at the state level. The contractor carries out sub standard, shoddy
work and sometimes not what was required. But the payment for this work is forced upon the _sarpanch_
who is helpless.

The _Sarpanch_ is not supposed to make any payment for works authorized by the State Government but
since the people of the village have no power and neither does the _sarpanch_ they can do nothing, even
more so because of the tilt of power towards the centre.

## _Panchayat Secretary_ -- Of the State Government or of the _Panchayat_?

Employees and the _secretary_ of the _panchayat_ are appointed by the State Government as per the law.
The _key responsibility areas_ (KRA) are also decided by the State Government. The question is who is the
better judge of the capabilities and abilities of these employees other than the people of the village and
the _sarpanch_ for whom they are working? What is the nature of the work to be done and when it needs
to be done should be decided by the people of the village and not by the State Government.

## The story of _backward region grant fund_

"_Backward region grant fund_" is a scheme muted by the Central Government for the backward areas of
the country. This fund is meant to be dispersed to implement various schemes in the backward areas of
the district depending upon the needs of the people. It is the prerogative of the _gram sabha_ to start the
projects that they want. There are about 250 districts where this scheme is in operation. Sirsa and
Mahendergarh are two backward districts in Haryana where this scheme is being implemented. When
we visited these two districts, we realized that there were no _gram sabhas_ and yet _backward region
grant fund_ was being utilized by the State government. It was found that the money was transferred
under the account of _District Collector_. The _collector_ distributed the fund, according to the provision of
the law, to the _gram sabha_ , on receiving the schemes forwarded by the said _gram sabha_. But the
_collector_ used the fund indiscriminately without getting any proposal from _gram sabha_.

Many political leaders exert pressure on the _district collector_ and get works done using the _backward
region grant fund_. A political leader had a big tract of agricultural land in a village. He pressurized the
_collector_ and got many works done around his land. Had this decision to use the fund been left to the
_gram sabhas_ then the work around the _Neta_'s land would not have seen the light of the day.

Certain young boys in the district of Sirsa conducted various _gram sabhas_ and made proposals for use of
_backward region grant fund_. Despite the fact that the provision of the law is very clear that proposals
forwarded by the _gram sabha_ will be accepted by the _collector_ and the fund dispersed, accordingly, the
_collector_ has not deemed it fit to accept the proposals forwarded by these 18 villages or sanctioned the
funds, even though one year has gone by.

## Conclusions

There are innumerable examples all over the country that prove that in today's _panchayati raj_,
_panchayats_ have no role to play in the administrative or the political set up of the country.

_Gram sabhas_ or people, _panchayat_ or _sarpanch_ have been given no power. No rights to question the
authority of the BDO, the _collector_ or their political masters.

For effective development of the country, the people/_gram sabha_/_sarpanch_ must be given powers to
question the BDO/_collector_/political masters for their acts of omission and commission. Their free run
on the country's resources and wealth has to be checked.

That can only happen if the people have the power to take decision at the grass root level. That grass
root level begins from the villagers and the city dwellers.
