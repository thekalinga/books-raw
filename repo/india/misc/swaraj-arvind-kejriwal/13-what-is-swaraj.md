# What is _SWARAJ_?

It is a hindi word. _Swa_ means "my" and _Rajya_ means "Kingdom". _Swaraj_ mean "My Kingdom". If it is
my kingdom then it is I who will govern the way I want. "_Swaraj_", therefore, stands for "Self
governance". We are a Democracy, which is governed by the people, of the people and for the people.
In other words we are part of this process of taking decisions for our welfare by ourselves.
The Democracy has three limbs --- Executive, Judiciary and the Legislature. The Executives are the
employees of the government. Judiciary is an independent body which upholds laws enshrined in the
Constitution & the Legislature is one that formulates the Laws.
The people with the power of the ballot choose their representatives and send them to the parliament
whose sole duty is to create and enact laws for the welfare of the people. The Executive is the arm of
the government that implements the policies made by the parliament.
Everything in this democratic set up is perfectly fine. Nothing seems to be out of place yet a rot has set
in our democratic set up where unscrupulous elements in the garb of Politicians (our representatives),
bureaucrats (employees of the government) in collusion with people (businessmen) are openly looting
the wealth of nation. Degradation of moral fiber, rampant corruption and naked greed have shaken our
belief in the Democracy that we had embraced so lustily.
There is something wrong on the fundamental level!

## One

Our representative seeks the power of our vote with obsequious postures and folded hands. Once voted
as the representative he immediately sheds this posture and becomes a despotic ruler. He has a free
hand to do what he wants for next five years when he will again approach the people for their mandate.
He is not answerable, to the very people who elected him, for any acts good, bad or ugly.

The people loose control over the representative who like a ravenous shark gobbles up everything that
comes in his way.

## Two

The representatives formulate policies that are implemented by the Executive. But the policies and
plans and laws are enacted in such a way that the benefits accrue to the representatives only. Needless
to say in the ensuing loot the Executive partakes the proceeds of the profits. The best part is the citizens
cannot touch the Executive. After all, the Executive is responsible to the government and not to the
people. Even if you catch hold of an Executive of the government big or small you cannot prosecute him.
To initiate action against him you have to take permission from the President of India. This emboldens
the government executive who behaves like a bull in a china shop.

He is neither accountable nor answerable for any of his acts of omission and commission.

## Three

The rot that has set in has also touched the Judiciary which is supposed to dispense justice. The courts
are piling up with millions of cases that take an endless round of visits to the courts to get decision on
smallest of the crimes. Common citizen who faces the apathy of government officials and arrogance of
the politician does not even find solace in this institution known as Judiciary.

Therefore, the poor citizen has become a silent spectator in the murky drama that is being enacted in
front of him day in and day out. Frustrated, impotent and helpless he is looking for a solution that will
bring in semblance of order in this chaos that has engulfed his mind, body and soul. This is not _Swaraj_.
After the British quit we are now the slaves of this deception known as Democracy.

Through this book _SWARAJ_ we bring a definite formula that is seeking to empower the people. It is
seeking a law that will do the following.

a. Give people the power to "Recall" the elected representatives
b. Make all government officials Accountable for their acts of omission and commission
c. Decentralise power and distribute to people on the grass root level. On the level of _gram sabhas_
and Resident Welfare Associations (RWA) in the cities.
d. Exercise the right to voice/enforce his opinion in formulation of laws and policies through _gram
sabhas_ and RWA's.
e. Control the flow of government funds and use of the same.
f. People to be declared as the owners of national wealth like land, forest, waterways, minerals
etc.

To contain the spiraling corruption it proposes to bring in _Lokpal bill_. This is an independent
institution, which will look into cases of corruption against the Legislature, Executive and the
Judiciary. _Lokpal_ will look into corruption cases against the Central Government employees and
the _Lokayukta_ will look into corruption cases against the employees of the State Governments.

_Lokpal_ will operate within the frame work of transparency in operation. A _Lokpal_ is subservient
to the people and not above. Just the way people give executive power to the _Lokpal_/_lokayukta_
to act against the dishonest government employees and representatives, in the same way
_Lokpal_'s office is also subject to scrutiny. People will have the power to recall a _Lokpal_, if a _Lokpal_
is found to be corrupt.

_Lokpal bill_ proposes to merge existing Central Bureau of Investigation, Central Vigilance
Commission under the _Lokpal_ which is an independent agency and will not be under any
government control. _Lokpal_ will not be an advisory body but will have the executive power with
its own financial independence. It will not have to seek permission to investigate into any
corruption case, even if it is against the chief justice or the Prime Minister of India.

Such a vision of _Swaraj_ will bring about the necessary change that we dream of. Our demands
are very simple where we want the people to get justice, equality and prosperity. Our fight is
against corruption not only in high places but everywhere, which is sapping our resources. We
are not against any political party, we are not against any ethnic groups or business houses or a
foreign country, we are not communal or we ourselves are not self proclaimed representatives
of people but we are the people. The government is closing it eyes and refuses to read the
writing on the wall. The government is shutting its ears and refuses to hear the clamour for
bringing about a stringent law that deals with the corruption.

The Government must feel the pulse of the nation and see people of this country who are
jumping voluntarily into the second peaceful uprising of the independence. Satyagrah's are
happening not only in New Delhi but across all parts of the nation. This independence is from
the clutches of corruption, this independence is from our belief that _sab chalta hai_,
independence from accepting that we are a corrupt society.
