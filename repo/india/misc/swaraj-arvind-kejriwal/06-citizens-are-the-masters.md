# CITIZENS ARE THE MASTERS

We had adopted the model of Democracy after the independence in 1947, Government by the people,
of the people and **for the people**.

Once in five years "We the people" choose our representative from amongst ourselves and empower
them to take decisions for "We the people". But as soon as the elected representatives are installed in
the parliament, the power goes to their head and they become arrogant and autocratic. The power that
"We the people" give to the representatives for life and liberty of "We the people" is totally misused.
Decisions taken by the representatives are not for "We the people" but for "I the people".

The basic principal of Democracy is violated. Of the people, by the people is alright but FOR THE PEOPLE
is missing in this matrix.

\ 

This is what needs to change.

\ 

The representatives of the people should be accountable to "We the People". Once the vote is obtained
the elected leaders are there in Parliament or Legislative assemblies for five years. They are then not
accountable to the people whom they were representing. The leaders do what they want or what suits
their interest. The people's power is limited to electing their representatives only.

A change must be brought about where the people take all decisions and the implementation is left in
the hands of the elected representatives. Another change that needs to be brought about is ability of
the people to recall the self serving elected representatives, inept and corrupt. If such legislation comes
in force then the same representatives would bend backwards and forward in front of the people.

We need the control in the hands of the people. How can control be given to a population of hundred
crore people? Is it possible and everyone wonders!

It is possible? Constitution has recognized the village assemblies or _gram sabhas_. _Gram sabha_ is not
_panchayat_. _Panchayat_ constitutes of _village pradhan_, the _sarpanch_, the appointee of the government in
the ward and some prominent inhabitants of the village. But _gram sabha_ is the open assembly of the
people of the village. This joint meeting is the place where local matters are discussed.

## Need control over government servants

The right to take all decisions about the village and its organizational set up should be of the villagers.
The need is to bring about an amendment to the existing _Panchayati raj_ and other prevailing laws where
this power should be enshrined in the people of the village. The _gram sabha_ should have the power to
stop the salary of a teacher who is not coming to the school or not teaching properly.

If a Doctor does not take care of its patients then the _gram sabha_ should have power to stop his salary.
If a ration shop does not distribute ration properly or indulges in black market then the _gram sabha_
should have powers to cancel his license. If the Station House officer of a police station does not register
a report and indulges in extra constitutional methods against the people, then the _gram sabha_ should
have powers to stop his salary, too.

Do you think that it would bring about a change? Ofcourse it would change everyone from the errant
SHO to the inept teacher to a corrupt ration shop keeper. After all they are now accountable to the
people and they know that the real power now rests with the _gram sabha_ or the people. They all will
make sure that they remain on the right side of the people by serving the interest of the people.

Appointment of the teacher in a village should be done by the _gram sabha_. It has been seen that the
State Governments employ thousands of teachers by fraudulent means. The quality of teachers who
have paid bribes to get jobs is questionable. How would they teach children?

Under RTI (Right To Information) act it was found that in many a schools, up to class ten, of Jharkhand
state have not a single teacher. In Vamani higher secondary school, Kanuga, Saraikela, Kharsawa has 310
children but not a single teacher. In a school of Siroom there are 435 children in ten classes but there is
only one teacher, that too for Bangla language. Currently it is the duty of the State Government to
provide teachers in school. Many a times people in the above mentioned places wrote to the State
Governments but no answer ever came.

Should we keep waiting for the favours of the State Government when the teachers would be
appointed? This is a cruel joke played with the lives of millions of children spread across the nation.
Their lives are being compromised and sacrificed.

This system needs to be changed. The people of the community should be given the power to appoint
and dismiss the teachers. The people who go to a hospital for getting medical treatment should be
empowered to appoint and suspend the Doctor. The administration should go directly in the hands of
people. All government employees should be appointed by the _gram sabha_ and also suspended or
dismissed by the _gram sabha_. This right or the power to appoint and suspend all government employees
must rest with the _gram sabhas_.

This will greatly benefit the country. The State Governments appoint thousands of teachers from the
cities to reach in the villages at a salary of ₹15000/month but even then they do not want to work
in the villages. But if the _gram sabhas_ are allowed to appoint the teachers then the teachers appointed
from the village will work for ₹5000/month. If they do not teach then they could be suspended by
the _gram sabhas_.

By changing the law steps should be taken that _gram sabhas_ should have power to call any BDO or
employee of the government on the village level to attend their meetings and to obey orders passed by
the _gram sabha_. On the district or block level the people could give orders to government employees.
The people should have the power to summon the ration inspector, summon the BDO, summon the
_tahsildar_, summon the Sub Divisional Magistrate or summon the _Collector_ of the district. If the
government officer does not obey the decisions of the _gram sabha_ then the people should have powers
to punish the erring official.

The power to appoint and discharge the employees on block and district levels should rest with _gram
sabhas_ through the office bearers of the _block panchayat_ and _district panchayats_.

The people should have right to ask for information about any matter pertaining to their village, from
any government officer up to the state level. Inappropriate schemes are formulated by the State
Government for the villages. Therefore, the villagers should have right to know about the type of
decisions that are being taken and schemes that are formulated for the village. The _gram sabha_ should
have this right to know.

## Control over government money

Whatever money that is allotted to villages should be free fund and not the fund which is tied to one or
the other scheme. There are so many schemes like old age pension, widow pension, Indra awas yojana
and NREGA or many more. Villages do not need any scheme that the government moots because only a
fraction of the money allotted in these schemes reach the people it is meant for.

The villagers do not need these schemes but need free funds. If for the above funds lets say rupees five
crore is sent to a village send only three crore but that three crore should be a free fund that can be
utilized by the villagers as per their needs. The villagers in their _gram sabha_ should decide jointly as to
how much money is needed for irrigation and how much for widow pension. How much money is to be
spent on education and how much should be spent on health care. Let villagers/ _gram sabha_ be the
decision makers.

The villagers will decide what is the criteria that categorises one Below the Poverty Line (BPL). In
Hong Kong a person without an Air Conditioner is treated as a person who is BPL. In Delhi a rickshaw
puller is able to make rupees five thousand a month and yet is not able to make two ends meet. He is
forced to live in shanties in dirty surroundings. But rupee five thousand is enough in a village where that
same person can live decently.

The criteria, therefore, would be different for different State and geographical locations. Sitting in Delhi
no uniform policies can be adopted. What is BPL in Delhi is not BPL, for say in a place like Kalahandi.

Leave this to the social set up of a village. Let them decide that who among them does not have a house
and is in urgent need of the same. So he gets a house under such scheme. Under Indra Vikas Yojana the
government makes funds available for two houses in a village, which in turn, with connivance of corrupt
government employees, are given to people who do not need them. Let the villagers decide who is
without house and who is suffering from malnutrition. Let them decide what the need of their society is.
Let the people of _gram sabha_ allot funds to the hungry and funds for the homeless. Let the people of the
_sabha_ decide how much money should be spent on education so that every child of the village can
become literate. It would be the collective responsibility of the people to provide for its people funds
that have come actually from the people's tax money. This would be an ideal way of Democracy where
the wealth of the people will recycle and grow.

In villages and town people raise loans from Loan Sharks at exorbitant rates of interest. When they want
to start a small business or start farming then the _gram sabha_ can disburse loan from the available funds
to the needy at reasonable rates of interest. This is possible only if free fund is available to the _gram
sabhas_ and not fund that is tied to one scheme or the other.

Toady many a farmers are committing suicide in several villages of the country. These are the people
who have been driven to take such measure because of economic reasons but if the _gram sabhas_ have
the funds available then such suicides will stop in the country.

Many a times the harvested grain starts to rot due to untimely rain. The harvested grain is not stored in
warehouse, which causes huge financial loss to the farmers. The farmers could have made warehouse
only if they had funds available to them. The government is hardly able to look at their crying need.

There is a small village near Chennai by the name of Kutumbacum whose _sarpanch_ is Ilango. He is the
first chemical engineer who left his job fifteen years back and decided to become _sarpanch_ of his village.

There are about thousand families in the village. It was estimated that people buy things of daily use to
the tune of rupees fifty lakhs a month. These are things like soap, cooking oil, food stuff and others. Ilango
believed that at least 80% things could be produced in the village itself. He got a lot of cottage
industry started in the village itself that started to produce oil, food stuff for consumption and bricks for
the houses.

If free fund is available to the villagers or the _gram sabhas_ then all this can be achieved by all the villages
that can spur the economy of the village and the country. This free fund available in the hands of
people, not in the hands of corrupt and inept government employees, can help them put up small
production units for things that the village needs most.

In many villages of a block near Pune a successful experiment is in progress. Earlier between June and
September people used to face severe financial crises. During this period people used to run towards
cities for employment or take loan from the money lender at exorbitant rates of 100--150%. If villagers
took 100 kg of grain then to the money lenders they used to give back 150 kg after four months. In
spite of such a high rates of interest that was paid by the villagers they were still under the clutches of
these loan sharks who would make these borrowers work for free in the fields of lender. This had
adverse effect on the borrowers who used to get into a vicious cycle. For 100 kg grain that they bought,
they paid back 150 kg, which is 50% higher. In other words they were unable to pay back this
loan and went back to the same money lender again and again.

But in this block an organization started a Grain Bank. The people created an association and this
association loaned grain to the members of the society according to the need of the members. Instead
of returning 150 kg grain, now they had to return only 125 kg grain only. In four years time the farmers
have been able to repay the entire loan amount to this association. There is no fear of the money
lender, no working free for him and freedom from the loan. Now, the villagers have surplus grain that is
being stored by the association. This experiment is running successfully in about 150 villages in the
neighborhood.

If the villagers could get free fund then similar grain banks could be started in all villages which could be
free from hunger and the clutches of the loan sharks to write their own story of success.

All schemes of government should be stopped. These schemes get entangled into a complicated web of
government officials on the village and state level, powerful bureaucrats and their political masters who
are neither accountable to the people nor they could be prosecuted. Only 10% of the money under
these grand schemes reach the people rest is lost or embezzled in transit. "We the people" squirm and
squeal helplessly and watch the drain of our own tax money without recourse to any one.

But if all schemes by the government are stopped and free fund made available to the _gram sabhas_ or
the people, then a revolution will come in the country that can erase poverty, hunger and
unemployment.

## Will corruption increase if _gram sabhas_ are empowered?

It is believed by many that free fund sent directly to the _gram sabhas_ will be misused by the people.
How will it be misused was our question? If a sum of rupees three crore is made available to _gram sabha_
then it is possible that all villagers decide to keep this money or in other words distribute amongst
themselves and not use for their own development. Our reply is then let them do this. Even today what
is happening that the entire money is embezzled by the politicians, the officials, the _collector_, the BDO,
the _tehsildar_. If the villagers have decided to keep this money by themselves, in a joint meeting, then let
it be so. The people's money has gone back to the people and not to the middlemen.

But villagers will not do so. Who do you think loves a child more --- his mother or the _secretary of
education_? It is evident that it is the mother. So how do you assume that the villagers would decide that
they do not want education for their children, health services for sick and the aged? They would
naturally want schools for education and hospitals for the sick and want all means of development of
their village. Therefore, such a scene that the money will be distributed amongst them without a
thought to development will never happen. The money will go into cottage industry, in building of roads
and canals, for horticulture and agriculture and for warehouses. To think that this money would be
distributed amongst them is a figment of imagination.

There is one more possibility that the _sarpanch_ may usurp all this money by taking false signature of
people without calling a village meeting. This is possible. It is happening even today. The money may
come as free fund or in funds tied to schemes; if the _sarpanch_ is corrupt then the money is embezzled.
The money would go to the villagers or not, the fate entirely depends on the fact that the _sarpanch_ is
honest or corrupt. It also depends on the fact that the people are aware of their rights.

In today's scenario people do not even know how much money has been allotted to any of the projects
and how much money has trickled in the village _sarpanch_'s hands. In the new dispensation that we are
proposing there is going to be transparency on the size of allocation of funds and the power to dispose
off that fund the way the villagers want. Once the people have the power to raise their voices against
the _sarpanch_, the BDO, the _Collector_ and the State Government then there are very few chances that
this money could be siphoned off easily by all the concerned officials and politicians.

When people raise their voices then more free funds will flow, the _sarpanch_ will be forced to honesty.
Today the fund is siphoned off by the chain of people who are handling that fund but the real people,
for whom this fund is meant, have no say in the disbursement of the fund. The chosen few, by
fraudulent means, are the ones who get involved and no one else has any interest in it. In Indra Vikas
Yojana, the _sarpanch_ takes bribes from three chosen individuals who are the beneficiaries and rest of
the people in the village are hardly concerned. They have no power to question the decisions of the
_sarpanch_ who in turn is blessed by the chain of the higher ups. In a scenario where this money comes
under free fund then the fund would be under the glare of all the villagers. The fund has to be disbursed
by a consensus vote in an open assembly of people. The people of the village would be together and it
would be very difficult for _sarpanch_ to act unjustly. This would be a great step in curbing corruption
because the fund is under the scrutiny of the people.

Today the people have no voice, no way to take action against the organized mafia within the
government machinery. In self governed _gram sabha_, the Sabha will have power to question the actions
of government officials and also will have ability to punish and if required suspend them.

## Citizen's opinion should be taken to formulate policies and law

As per our constitution, members of the legislative assembly (MLA) and members of the parliament
(MP) are the nominated members on the block and district levels of the _panchayats_. But the constitution
has given them no responsibility. In our opinion, if a law is tabled in the parliament or in the state level
legislative assembly, then they should be duty bound to distribute the salient points of this law to
people on block and district level. They should then discuss the nitty gritty of the law and take the opinion
of the people about the proposed law. The people will discuss the same in _gram sabhas_ and the
common opinion of the _gram sabhas_ should be put forth in the parliament through the MP and MLA's.

Today we vote and send our representatives to the parliament or legislative assembly. They are our
representatives first and then members of parties like BJP or congress or any other party that they
belong to. It is obligatory on their part to know the opinion of the constituents before voting for any
legislation or policies of the government. But to pass legislation in the parliament, whips are issued by
the party presidents like Sonia Gandhi for congress and all members of the party vote in favour for the
proposition. If it is BJP then Advani or Gadkari will issue a whip and all members would vote in favour or
against the proposition. Mayawati will make all members vote in a manner that she wants. Party then
becomes supreme for our representatives and the people are totally sidelined. Their interest or opinion
is seldom taken care of.

This autocracy of the high command has to be stopped. What the people want, the representative
should present in the parliament or the legislative assemblies. If this happens then it would be direct
control of the people on the legislations being formulated in the parliament or the legislative assembly.

Then it would become very difficult for the government to pass unjust and ridiculous bills like "Nuclear
liability bill". Then it will become very difficult to pass a bill in the parliament under the pressure of a
foreign company or a foreign country. The citizens will, then, be able to pass any legislation that they
want.

## Control over natural resources

The people should have direct control over water, forest, minerals and other natural resources

### Land

It has been pointed out earlier that whenever an industrialist wants to set up a factory in some areas
then they take permission from the State Government. Corrupt officials and politicians of the State
Government accept bribes and sell this land to the industrialist at concessional rates. No one consults
the farmers if they want to do farming or want to sell the land and do something else. Their opinion,
their welfare and their livelihood is not on the minds of the State Government.

We are seeking a change in the law that directs a company to put up an application for permission to set
up a factory in a _gram sabha_ in whose vicinity the land falls. His application for permission will then be
decided in the _gram sabhas_ in whose vicinity the land falls. The State Government will then take
permission from _gram sabhas_ of the areas because the sale will affect the livelihood of people of the
area. The application for selling of land will then be made to the _panchayati secretary_. He will put forth
the proposal in the _gram sabhas_ where he will take the permission of the Sabha or the people. The
people will decide if they want to part with the land or not. If they want to sell the land then they will
decide the terms of the sale. The industrial house can buy the land on the terms of the sale ratified by
the _gram sabha_ in an open meeting.

In the same way if the State or Central Govt wants to acquire a village then they must send in an application
to the _panchayat_ and enter in a dialogue with the _gram sabha_ directly.

There are many a villages where only 10--15% villagers own the land. Others till the land on contract.
The compensation for sold or acquired land goes to the landowners and others who were doing manual
labour not only get nothing but even lose their livelihood. It would become the duty of _gram sabha_ to
take care the interest of such labourers when the land is acquired or sold.

_Gram sabha_ must have direct control over the land that falls in their area.

### Mines

On deposits of minor minerals _gram sabhas_ should have the direct control. Who should have control
over the large deposits of minerals. It is indeed accepted that the entire country is the owner of large
deposits of minerals on which no one will have any objection. How these minerals would be deployed
for general welfare of the society at large is a complicated question. The right to give permit to mine the
minerals is with the State and the Central Government. They have misused this right. They, after taking
bribes, have in fact sold the right to mine at throw away prices to various companies.

Should this right to issue permit for mining of minerals be given to the _gram sabha_? It is argued that the
mining companies are so powerful that they can bring in a lot of pressure on villagers and can offer
inducements that it would become extremely difficult for the villagers to resist.

The solution to this problem will come in some middle path. A national policy on how should the
minerals be used, how much should be exported and how much they should be extracted must be taken
after due deliberation at the _gram sabha_ level. On the basis of the national policy, right to give permit
on the village, block or state level for mining of minerals is given to all the _gram sabhas_ that are affected.

### Forest

The _gram sabhas_ should be the direct owner of all small scale businesses of the forest. Contracts for
timber and bamboo must not be given without consultation and approval of the _gram sabhas_, to the
contractors. _Gram sabhas_ should also decide the terms of the contract.

### Water

The water sources that fall under the boundaries of a village will automatically be treated as the
property of the village. No decision should be taken, like building a dam, on large water resources like
river, without the consent of the _gram sabhas_.

## There should be division of work between various levels of government

A division will have to be carried out of the work between various levels of government departments,
government wealth and various corporations. There is division between the works carried out by state
and Central Governments but such a division does not exist between State Government and various
levels of _panchayat_.

All decisions pertaining to works to be carried out on the level of village should be taken in the _gram
sabhas_ only. The people should decide in _gram sabha_ as to which works can be carried out. The details
should be made of properties like roads, sewers etc. that fall under the jurisdiction of their village only.
Name all government agencies that provide services to their village. Identify village centered school that
gives education to their children only. A law should be enacted that transfers all works related to the
village along with government agencies that provide services and wealth that falls under village
jurisdiction. The fund required for maintaining the wealth, to carry out works and expenses of the
agencies along with government employees should be transferred to the _gram panchayat_.

First, a list of works should be made which are village centric. Then, a list of works should be made in
every block where certain works, properties fall under two villages. In the same way a list should be
made on the level of the district where works of two or more blocks along with wealth and government
agencies are common for many villages and blocks. Funds and the government employees required to
maintain properties or carry out works should be transferred to the villages, blocks or districts as the
case may be who will exercise all control over them. If a dispute arises between two villages regarding
the jurisdiction of property or works then that dispute should be solved on the level of the block. The
disputes on the block levels should be settled on the district level and the disputes on the district level
should be solved on the state level.

## How the decision will be taken in _Swaraj_ system of governance?

A _block panchayat_ would be constituted by combining all the heads of village under it. Chairpersons of
all the _block panchayat_ on the district level will constitute a district _panchayat_.

The decision that affect, lets say four or five villages, will be taken on the block level. For example, if a
road is to be constructed that connects four or five villages then the decisions on that would be under
the purview of the block. But all the decisions that are being taken on the block levels must be ratified
by each of the _village panchayats_ which are directly affected by the decision of the block. Under no
circumstances the decisions can be taken by the block without the consent of the _village panchayats_.
The decisions for common works for three or four blocks will be taken on the district level. In the same
way decisions pertaining to the district levels will be taken on the state level.

It is imperative that the decision at the top level of the pyramid structure, of dispensation, that we are
proposing must be ratified by the bottom most layers. In other words the decision on the village level
will be accepted by the block level and the decisions of the block level will be accepted by the district
level and the decisions of the district levels would be accepted by the state. Once there is a majority
consensus only then a decision can be taken.

The State Governments are free to take decisions on works that are carried out on state level and are
not obliged to involve the opinions of the _gram sabhas_.

However, _gram sabhas_ would be empowered to put forth their demands on any issue. If 5% of
the _gram sabhas_ on the district level pass a proposal then the State Government will have to send that
proposal to all villages of the district. If 50% or more of the _gram sabhas_ ratify that resolution
then the State Government is duty bound to accept that resolution even if it requires the change in
existing law.

## Effect of this on Indian politics

The day the _gram sabhas_ start to operate across the country, with power vested in them, that is the day
the people will have direct control over the parliament. It would mean that people will have direct
control over the political scene, too. Today there is complete control of corrupt leaders, corrupt parties
and criminals over the Indian politics. That control will start to wean. Then people will start to have
direct control over politics and governance of this country. This will bring about all inclusive progress,
remove unemployment and eradicate poverty.

Only when the power comes directly in the hands of the people, that would be the day true Democracy
will dawn in the country. If this happens, education will improve, roads will become better, water would
be made available, electricity will be in abundance, health services will improve, poverty will go away
and that will solve the problem of _Naxalism_, too.

## There is need for sweeping changes in the _panchayati raj_ and other laws

There are many suggestions given at the end of the book. State and Central Governments can make
amendments in the _panchayati raj_ law and other laws on their levels and can impose them. There will be
no need for making amendments in the constitution.
