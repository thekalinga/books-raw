In December 1981 the _Lokayan
(Gujarat)_ organised a pioneering seminar
on _Dalit literature_ in Bombay. It
was pioneering in the sense that it was
the first of, what might hopefully become,
a series of get-togethers of
Marathi and Gujarati _Dalit writers and
critics_, The fact that it was the first
of its kind and also that two literatures
were presented and discussed made
some of the proceedings of
the seminar very formal and elementary.
Nevertheless the seminar succeeded
in identifying some of the problems
that _Dalit writers_ face, particularly in
Gujarat. The _Dalit movement_ is relatively
young in Gujarat. It does not
have a tradition in terms of either a
social movement or a literary movement,
as it certainly has in Maharashtra.
Precisely for that reason the deliberations
showed earnestness and led to
exchange of some useful information
and experience.

About forty people had come from
Gujarat. Last year a little magazine
called _Akrosh_ published from Ahmedabad
suddenly acquired national fame
following the government ban on one
of its issues. The issue in question had
published some _Dalit poetry_  which
'the progressive section of the national
_bourgeoisie_' in power in Ahmedabad had
found to be inflammatory material and
so tha issue was banned. All the young
people connected with _Akrosh_ participated
in the exchange of views. The number
of Marathi _Dalit writers_ who attended
the seminar was much smaller. One
wonders why that happened. There
were not more than three or four
Marathi _Dalit writers_ as against nearly
twentyfive Gujarati _Dalit writers_. Apart
from the _Dalit writers_ themselves, the
seminar was attended by literary critics,
socialist thinkers and social scientists.

The seminar was a success. It must
have been the first time somebody
made a serious effort to go into the
social and historical genesis of _Dalit
protest_ in Gujarat. The first day was
taken up in the discussion of the social
framework of the _Dalit protest_ in
Gujarat. The discussion provided the
basic statistical data on the distribution
of the _Dalit population_ in Gujarat,
bringing out some often ignored statistical
facts such as that fifteen per cent
of the population of Ahmedabad is made
up of _Dalits_ and that the percentage of
_Dalits_ in the population of Sabarkantha
district is as high as twentyfive. The
speakers went into the history of rising
_Dalit consciousness_ and the _Dalit movement_,
the various influences this movement
has absorbed and the fact that
unlike Maharashtra, Gujarat has lacked
a continuous movement for social reform
and protest, epitomised in Maharashtra
by Phule, Agarkar and Ambedkar.
The discussants like Bhanu
Adhwaryu, Mohammed Sheikh, Manishi
Jani, Achyut Yagnik, Punalekar
and others sought to identify the various
_scheduled castes_, their problems
and their response to the movement
and the repression --- both social and
governmental --- around them. Bhalchandra
Phadke, Arun Kamble, Arjun
Dangle, Dinkar Sakrikar and Deshpande
provided the Maharashtra backdrop to
these discussions.

Another interesting feature of the
discussion was the attempt made by
some, notably Dalpat Chauhan, to
relate the present day protest to the
protest literature of the middle ages.
There was some lively controversy over
this. While commentators like Chauhan
and Sonalkar related contemporary
protest to traditional protest-literature,
those like Deshpande related it
to the impact of Europe and maintained
that the contemporary protest is
modern, or in any case has to be
modern to be really effective, and that
it is discontinuity rather than continuity
which is the more relevant aspect of
situation.

The experimentation in terms of
form that is going on in _Dalit literature_
was analysed by Manishi Jani
(particularly the street play), Sheikh,
Phadke, Arjun Dangle, Arun Kamble
and others. The discussions, however,
were a little disjointed and lacked an
overall perspective. The critical discussion
was even less coherent. What
does and should the _rejection of established
aesthetics_ mean? The answers
seemed to vary. The participants did
not appear to have a clear notion of
such rejection. Kamble and Phadke
on the Marathi side of the gathering
were content to repeat the familiar
rhetoric. By comparison, the Gujarati
writers appeared far more serious in
grappling with this question. The same
was true of the discussion on the language
which _Dalit writers_ employ.
Whom are they communicating with?
What is going to happen to the linguistic
mode with which the _Dalit writers_
are quite familiar today after a generation
or two more of urbanisation? Does
and should the rejection of '_Brahmanical_'
literature necessarily involve turning
one's back on traditional literature
and language as literature and language?
Again the younger Gujarat movement
had a better understanding of
and more earnest involvement in these
questions than the few Marathi writers
present. A part of the reason for this,
however, is that Marathi _Dalit literature_
has already at a practical level
solved this question. Its language is
in fact more living, volatile and authentic.
Critical formulations which might
explain its authenticity and sincerity
are, however, badly needed. The discussions
at the Seminar seemed to
underline this lacuna.

On the second day the seminar
turned to a critical estimate of the
trends in the _Dalit literature_. The
_Dalit movement_ and literature_,  the
need for their firm rooting in the materialist
tradition, the nature and import
of the 'convert to Buddhism' movement,
and so on were discussed. One
must mention here that unlike the
Maharashtra _Dalits_, the Gujarat _Dalits_
are less dominated by Ambedkar and
his personality. In fact one Gujarati
_Adivasi writer_ did raise the question
whether some of the formulations of
Ambedkar might not be dated now.
Whereas for the _Dalits_ of Maharashtra
Ambedkar's thought seems to be the
horizon beyond which they need not
and cannot see, the Gujarat writers,
while they were aware of the significance
of Ambedkar, were willing to
approach any thinker without putting
such limitations. Being in the formative
stages perhaps, the Gujarat movement
appeared to be far more open-minded
than its Marathi counterpart.

There was discussion of the incipient
idealism which has come to dominate
_Dalit writing and criticism_, This
idealism may partly be responsible for
_Dalit writers and critics_ seeming to
take a remarkably narrow view of
their predicament. Deshpande pointed
out that reading _Dalit socio-political
analysis and criticism_ one got a feeling
that India was an island completely
free of outside influences. They seemed
unaware that every phenomenon
has an international aspect today.
Ashok Patil talked of the _Shramana
Culture_ and the _Brahmanical Culture_
quite rightly but seemed unaware that
there were other cultures too and these
were no less dangerous than the _Brahmanical_
one.

The present writer gets the feeling
every time he hears _Dalit writers_ and
critics that they are making valid
points in and about a narrow region of
experience. There is, however, a bigger
world outside that region. Their main
point very correctly is that the mainstream
literatures in our country
relate to a world of experience which
is quite small and narrow. The
_Lokayan seminar_ made that point once
again. But the _Dalit writers_ are
blissfully unaware of a bigger world
of which even their areas of experience
are a part. This seminar was yet
another testimony to this lack of
awareness or indifference. One wishes
that the _Dalit writers_ extend their
analysis and vision to areas beyond
the ones they have been handling. If
they did they might come up with
almost revolutionary answers, They
certainly have the potential.
