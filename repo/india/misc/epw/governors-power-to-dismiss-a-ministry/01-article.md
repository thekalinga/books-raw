The opinion of M C Setalvad, our
former Attorney-General, on any
constitutional matter commands both
attention and respect. And his statement
that it is his opinion that the
Governor of a State does have the
power to dismiss a Ministry needs
the most careful examination. Setalvad
has stated that the Governor
has the power to dismiss the Ministry
"if he is satisfied that the Ministry
was in a minority and it was not
prepared to hold an Assembly session
within a reasonable time".

At first blush, this approach to
the matter sounds quite reasonable
because the pre-condition for exercise
of discretion by the Governor
would be that he should be satisfied
that the Ministry was in a minority;
but the difficulty in accepting this
approach is that it ignores the most
important and essential question
that must be kept in the centre of
the controversy when considering
the powers of the Governor---the relationship
between the Centre and
the States, when both Parts V and
VI of the Constitution are in operation.

It has to be remembered that the
Federal structure of the Indian Constitution
clearly defines the powers
of the Centre and of the States in
these two parts of the Constitution.
And a reading of these two parts
would indicate that to the extent
to which the Council of Ministers
of the Union headed by the Prime
Minister is supreme in Union. affairs
under Part V, to that same extent
in a State the Council of Ministers
headed by the Chief Minister is supreme.
It would not be possible, in
my opinion, to justify any intervention
by the President in the conduct
of the affairs of the Union by his
Council of Ministers except if there
is an actual violation of the Constitution;
and a possible violation of
the Constitution in refusing to convene
Parliament can only arise if
the Parliament is not convened within
the six months provided for
under Article 85. No doubt it may be
argued that there is a lacuna in
the Constitution in that despite the
fact that a majority of members of
Parliament may proclaim their lack
of confidence in the Council of Ministers,
they will be unable to bring
down the Ministry for quite some
time because the Ministry can avoid
convening Parliament for six months.
Only when the limit of six months
is violated would it be open to the
President to intervene in the name
of saving the Constitution from
violation by the Ministry.

This is so far as the Centre is
concerned. But at the Centre we
have a President who is not necessarily
an adherent of any political
party or responsible to it for his
appointment. In fact, the office of
the President of the Indian Republic
is looked upon as a non-party one
and the duty of the President is
undoubtedly to safeguard the Constitution
from violation by authorities
appointed under it. But the position
in the States is different. The
Governor is appointed by the President,
not in exercise of his personal
discretion but on the advice of the
Council of Ministers headed by the
Prime Minister (Article 156). Inevitably
the Governor becomes a
party man as his tenure of office as
Governor can be terminated by the
same authority that appoints him,
namely the Council of Ministers,
headed by the Prime Minister.

Necessarily, therefore, he has to
be loyal to his master, the Central
Government. It would be absurd to
believe that a person whose continuance
in office depends on the goodwill
of the Central Government will
act in any way other than on its
instructions. This position of the
Governor stands out in sharp contrast
to the position of the President
whose tenure of office of five years
cannot be cut short except by a
motion of impeachment, passed
under Article 61 of the Constitution.

In fact, the Constitution expects
the Governor to act on the instructions
of the Central Government.
There is Article 201 which provides
for his referring Bills for consideration
of the President. There is Article
356 whereby on receiving a report
from him the President may take
over legislative and governmental
powers in the State. And in these
Articles it is not the President who
acts in exercise of personal discretion;
in contrast, the Constitution envisages
action by the President on
the advice of his Council of Ministers,
which means in essence, the
party in power at the Centre. Therefore
at all stages of the Governor's
activities in his role as appointee of
the Central Government, he has to
act on its instructions and follow its
directives.

This is why I think we have to
approach with great caution an interpretation
of the Constitution which
involves an extension of the powers
of the Governor. For, the greater the
discretion vested in the Governor,
the greater the possibility of Central
intervention and intrigue in State
affairs.

This was no problem when the
same party was in power at the
Centre and in the States. It has
become a problem only now when
the one-party rule of the Congress
has ended, probably once and for
all. Today in many States, Governments
have een formed by parties
opposed to the Congress party which
rules at the Centre. If, therefore, the
Governor is given the right to examine
whether a Ministry is in a
minority, then immediately the way
is open for him to step down from
the high pedestal of the Constitutional
head and enter into day-to-day
political strife and turmoil.

And, moreover, one has to note
that Setalvad opined that the Governor's
part begins "if he is satisfied
that the Ministry was in the
minority and it was not prepared
to hold an assembly session within
a reasonable time". These two preconditions
are both incapable of exact
determination. To be satisfied
that a Ministry is in a minority,
would involve the Governor in fishing
around to find out on which side
each member of the Legislative Assembly
stood; and from fishing
around to actually persuading members
of the Assembly to take this
or that decision is not a far cry.
Next is the question of convention
of the Assembly session "within a
reasonable time". The "reasonable
time" mentioned here is something,
like the Chancellor's foot, incapable
of any exact measurement. What
may be reasonable to one Governor
who may not be so ready to dance
to tune of the Centre may be unreasonable
to another. Or in terms
of current Indian politics, what appeared
reasonable to Anantasayanam
Iyengar, former Governor of Bihar,
may not appear so to his successor,
Nityanand Kanungo. Thus, we create
a dangerous area where Governors
may act according to their own sweet
idea of "a reasonable time". Such
is the perspective opened up by the
suggestion of Setalvad. And here
again I think that the only answer
to be found at present in the Constitution
is that a Chief Minister
cannot keep on in power without
calling an Assembly more than six
months \[Art 174(1)\] and if he is
defeated in that Assembly he has
to resign \[Art 164(2)\].

Perhaps, the six months period
may be considered too long; in that
case the Constitution might be
amended to make the period shorter.
Or another method of ensuring that
a Council of Ministers that has lost
its majority in the Assembly does
not continue in power would be to
add a new sub-clause to Art 174
under which a majority of members
of the Assembly shall be entitled
to request the Speaker to call
a meeting of the Assembly within
one month on receipt of their requisition
made in the prescribed
manner. This would ensure that if
a Ministry that has lost its majority
in the Assembly attempts to continue
in power, the majority can compel
the convention of the Assembly within
a period of one month.

The rather difficult position which
Setalvad's view leads us to is that
one Governor may feel that a week
is too long and another may feel a
month is too short! Thus in matters
like this where the individual is left
free to form an opinion, the Governor
is likely to be politically motivated
in favour of the party which appoints
him, the party in power at
the Centre; as against this, it would
be much better to take away the discretion
that allegedly is vested in
him. Instead, there can be inserted
another provision in the Constitution
which will put everything in
cut-and-dried terms, incapable of
either argument or abuse.

My anxiety is to preserve the
autonomy of the States. Once a particular
party or coalition of parties
has come to power in a State, it is
necessary to do one's best to limit
the area where the Central Government
may use its constitutional
power to erode the position of the
State Ministry. To vest in the Governor
vital power is to increase the
capacity for Central mischief in a
State. It is possible to appreciate that
the period of time mentioned in
Article 174, namely 6 months, may
give an unfair advantage to a Chief
Minister who has completely lost
confidence of his Legislative Assembly.
It would be a farce if, for
instance, a month after the dissolution
of the Assembly, a Chief Minister
loses confidence of the majority,
yet he refuses to call the Assembly
for another five months and rules
on, despite the fact that the party
of which he is head has been reduced
to a minority. But this lacuna in the
Constitution can certainly be remedied
by inserting a provision as
suggested earlier by which, on receiving
a requisition from more than
half the members of the Legislative
Assembly, a Speaker must convene
a session of the Assembly within
one month of its receipt.

This, I consider, would be a more
democratic approach to the matter
than to vest discretionary power in
the Governor. For the starting point
of my argument is that to vest discretionary
powers in the Governor
will be to open the door to Central
intervention in a manner that was
not anticipated by the makers of
the Constitution and that goes directly
against the principle of State
autonomy. To repeat, it must not be
forgotten that the State in its area
of power must be as supreme as the
Centre in its area, so long as Parts
V and VI of the Constitution are
both in operation.

There is yet another point: it is
not as if the Centre has no power
to intervene. It has this power, given
to it in the emergency provision,
Article 356; and if it so wishes, it
may intervene once it is satisfied
that the Government of the State
cannot be carried on in accordance
with the provisions of the Constitution.
Equally, it can advise the President
to refuse assent to a Bill
passed by the Legislative Assembly
(Art 201). Or it can resort to
use of Articles 256 and 257 to give
the permitted directions to ensure
compliance with the laws made by
Parliament.

These are the areas where the
Constitution envisages Central intervention.
But apart from them, if
one is to create fresh areas and
grounds for Central intervention,
then I am apprehensive that State
autonomy will be eroded day by
day and stage by stage. And, instead
of the federal structure which we
have today, we shall be saddled with
an interpretation which will transform
our Constitution to that of a
unitary state.
