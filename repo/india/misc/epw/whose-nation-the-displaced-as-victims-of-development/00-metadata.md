[^0]: This paper was presented at a workshop on
"Displacement and Resettlement", held at the
Delhi School of Economics on January 21--23, 1995.
I am grateful for the comments received
at the Workshop on 'Displacement and
Resettlement: Towards a National Policy,'
organised by the Centre for Development
Economics in Delhi from January 21--23, 1995
where this paper was first presented. I am also
grateful for the personal comments of Usha
Ramanathan, K G Kannabiran and Jean Dreze.
Finally, I would like to express my deep gratitude
to the several mass movements which I have had
the privilege of interacting with and whose
struggles have given me many of the insights
presented here.
