In the first decade of the twenty-first century, the Delhi High Court presided
over the most comprehensive and ruthless campaign to remove informal
'slum' settlements that the city had seen in a generation.[^4/2] According to the
official statistics, in 1998, Delhi had about 3 million people living in 1,100 _Jhuggi--Jhompri_
clusters. When the next such survey was conducted in March 2011, the
official figure had fallen to 685 _jhuggi--jhompri_ clusters housing around 2 million
people.[^4/3] The only other period when there was such a massive recorded fall in the
slum population in Delhi was between 1973 and 1977, when it fell from about
half a million to about a hundred thousand, with a decline of about 80,000 slum
households. This decline in 1973--77 is infamous because this was the period in
which the Internal Emergency was in force (between 1975 and 1977) and one of
the most notorious 'achievements' of the Emergency was a massive programme of
forced relocation of slums --- a well-known aspect of Delhi's contemporary history.[^4/4]
But how did this other more recent decline in the slum population of Delhi
take place? If the Emergency regime saw a breakdown of political negotiations
as a technocratic elite ran amok, the period between 1998 and 2011 saw a very
similar process unfold --- only this time the vehicle was Delhi's appellate judiciary,
particularly the Delhi High Court, acting principally in its Public Interest
Litigation (PIL) jurisdiction. In this chapter, I will examine how the procedural
departures made possible by India's peculiar PIL jurisdiction enabled it to function
as a slum demolition machine.

This phenomenon of the court-led slum demolition drive in Delhi has recently
been analyzed and explained by some scholars. However, the difficulty with the
existing literature on this topic is that it treats PIL cases as if they are like any
other. It tends to understate the specificities of the PIL jurisdiction which turned
to be so uniquely well-suited to facilitate such an expansive and unconventional
judicial role. The still common emphasis on the dilution of _locus standi_ of the
petitioner as the only significant attribute of a PIL case represses the other radical
characteristics of such cases that in reality take it far beyond any understanding
of an adjudicative proceeding. I argue, on the other hand, that to understand this
phenomenon of the court-led remaking of the city in its materiality, the procedural
departures of PIL, which the Delhi High Court took to its _reduction ad absurdum_
in this period, have to be understood and foregrounded.

Much of the critique of the Indian appellate courts' interventions in urban
governance has focused on its ideological predilections relying on a dissection of
judgments. I argue that such discursive analysis, while useful, serves only a limited
purpose in helping us understand this phenomenon. Perhaps the most persuasive
of such analysis has come from Asher Ghertner. He discusses two key aspects of
the early phase of the slum demolition cases.[^4/5] First, he examines the language
of a bunch of PIL petitions and judgments to demonstrate a perceptible shift in
nuisance law, which recast slums as nuisance _per se_. Second, he demonstrates that
these cases are clearly based on aesthetic judgments, i.e. the apparently unsightly
nature of slums makes them appear illegal to the judges, the photographs of these
settlements often serving as the only evidence against them. Both are important
points, which help us decipher the shift in the substantive legal doctrine of
nuisance, as well as account for the discursive context in which the courts were
operating.[^4/6]

However, on the first point, it is important to understand that a pure
conceptual development in the law, like the change in legal interpretation of
nuisance, can only go so far. It does not provide the apparatus to change the very
nature of governance, to enforce their ideas via a takeover of the whole arena. PIL
has made this possible in the arenas in which it has intervened. It provides the
procedural framework to create a field for its operation and transform it. Secondly,
I would argue that it is PIL with the kind of power it vests in judges which actually
empowers them to act on their biases (aesthetic, anti-poor or otherwise) and that
too with a free hand in a most expansive manner, unconstrained by technicalities
and rules of adjudication, and on such flimsy evidence as random photographs.
The particular unaesthetic slum might not even appear in any case before them,
but they can _suo motu_ (i.e. by their own initiative) invoke it in a PIL and make it
the object of their judicial concern. And not just at the level of one slum, but at
the level of the whole city, as we shall see. While I am sympathetic to the existing
literature which maps the ideological shifts in judicial discourse and which usually
explains such changing trends in PIL cases (relating to slum demolitions and
otherwise) from 1980s to the twenty-first century in terms of shifts in political
economy, I argue here that this still begs the question: why was the PIL court the
principal agent of such radical urban transformation in Delhi?

Additionally, discursive analysis is inadequate to understand this process, as
most of the city-related PIL cases of this era often did not end up in any 'judgments'
at all, but in an unending series of interim 'orders', which are not reported in law
reports. This is just another peculiarity of the twenty-first century PIL, among its
numerous other anomalous features. The distinction is important because while
orders carry the force of law, they are generally not reasoned and do not provide
an explanation of why that order has been given. Only if such an explanation is
present, it becomes a judgment. Much of the scholarship on PIL has ignored such
specificities of this jurisdiction and has continued to concentrate on the _completed_
judicial process, i.e. judgments and other reported decisions of the courts, and
the discursive charge they have. This is also the case because traditionally in a
common law jurisdiction like India, only judgments act as precedent for future
decisions, orders do not. As the Indian legal academic world is, therefore, only
focused on an analysis of such judgments, it is ill-equipped to deal with the
peculiar manifestations of the twenty-first century PIL that we discuss here.

In this chapter, my focus is on the proliferation of a new legal juggernaut that
emerged in this period, which I call 'omnibus PIL' that turns a PIL filed about
a specific problem in a specific part of the city into a PIL that deals with that
particular issue 'wherever it comes up in the city'. The biggest departure in omnibus
PIL cases was that the city became the scale at which the court defined and
addressed the problem. The optics through which the problem was framed and the
city made legible was usually the Delhi Master Plan. The original petitioner in the
PIL case with his or her specific concerns about a specific urban neighbourhood
would be either removed or made irrelevant or never have existed in the first place,
and instead an _amicus curiae_ or a monitoring committee would be appointed to
guide the court on the issue of a citywide basis. The whole city would then be
made subject to judicial intervention and correction through this process steered
by such a court-appointed figure. The informality of PIL procedure enabled the
court to monitor and micro-manage key aspects of the city's governance and make
the whole city the direct object of its reformative attention. The court no longer
needed the crutch of middle-class Resident Welfare Associations as aggrieved
PIL petitioners with concerns limited to a specific locality.

The 'omnibus PIL' enabled the court to legally extrapolate its own role in
the widest possible manner, making it a powerful weapon that was repeatedly
used to target the 'illegal' residents of the city, negotiating their precarious lives at
the edges of legality. The Delhi High Court deployed such PILs to order a city-level
'cleanup' of Delhi's street vendors, beggars and cycle-rickshaw drivers, but the
principal and persistent object of the Court's wrath were the city's slums. In this
chapter, I will rely on my fieldwork in the Delhi High Court during this period
when I followed a series of such cases to examine the changing material practices
of adjudication introduced by PIL. I shall argue that it was the unbearable lightness
of PIL procedure, which provided the juridical conditions of possibility for it to
function as a slum demolition machine.

## PIL cases against slums: The first phase

In the years after the Emergency, the slum population had returned to a steady
rate of growth, as no regime in Delhi dared a repeat of that experience. By 1981, in
fact, the slum population had already reached pre-Emergency levels.[^4/7] In the 1980s
and 1990s, there were a few evictions, but at least since 1990--91, a policy was in
place that officially guaranteed relocation in case of any slum demolition, stating
that any 'past encroachment which had been in existence prior to 31 January 1990
would not be removed without providing alternatives'.[^4/8]

That political compact broke down from the late 1990s onwards, with the courts
presiding over a spectacular and largely gratuitous campaign against slums that led
to almost a million people being evicted. The most infamous pronouncement that
announced this new phase came from the Supreme Court in 2000, in a PIL which
had no obvious connection with slums at all. Almitra Patel, an engineer with
long-standing experience in solid waste management, filed a PIL in 1996 in the
Supreme Court against the municipal garbage disposal practices in 300 of India's
largest cities. The court went on to appoint a committee in this case in 1998, to
formulate the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules for the
country, which were then officially notified. But once this apparatus had been set
in motion, the petitioner 'was unable to steer the course of the petition'[^4/9] and the
presiding judge Justice B. N. Kirpal turned the case towards the unrelated issue of
slums in Delhi,[^4/10] through a bizarre logical jump: blaming the slums for the solid
waste problem.[^4/11] The petitioner Almitra Patel later observed in an interview that
the court was trying to play 'Municipal Commissioner' and took the case on a
tangent for over two years, for reasons unclear to her.[^4/12] This is another instance
of a definite trend in PIL cases since the late 1990s, where the petitioner is made
redundant and the court steers the case in whatever direction it deems fit.[^4/13] In
such a situation, conventional modes of legal analysis distinguishing between the
'_Ratio Decidendi_' (literally 'the reason for a decision') and '_obiter dicta_' ('by the
way' remarks) of a judgment based on the issues around which the parties in the
case actually fought have little relevance because the whole judgment has nothing
to do with the _lis_ (dispute) in the case at all.

I quote here two passages from the infamous outburst by Justice Kirpal in
_Almitra H. Patel vs. Union of India_:

>13. Domestic garbage and sewage is a large contributor of solid waste. The
> drainage system in a city is intended to cope and deal with household
> effluent. This is so in a planned city. But when a large number of

These comments cited above, particularly the 'reward to a pickpocket' analogy,
revealed the Supreme Court of India's contempt for any attempt at humane
relocation, and soon became the basis of a ferocious slum removal campaign in
the Delhi High Court. The Court's main grouse in these cases was that of 'public
land' being encroached upon.

'Public land' was the land that had been acquired by the government,
especially the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which was designated the
sole developer of all the urbanizable land in Delhi in 1957. Land was acquired
and socialized in the 1950s and 1960s, and was to be developed according to
the terms laid down in the 'Master Plan'. Almost all slums in Delhi are located
on such public land, most of them on the land owned by DDA. Legal scholar
Usha Ramanathan diagnoses this malaise: 'The cause of the 'illegal' occupation of
public lands is ... directly attributable to the non-performance of state agencies.'[^4/15]
The 10^th^ Plan document of the Planning Commission of India itself noted that
up to 90% of the deficit in urban housing at the time pertained to the
urban poor and was attributable to non-provision of housing to slum dwellers.
The courts, throughout this period, ignored any attempt to bring its notice to any
such systemic analysis.

Emboldened by the 'pickpocket' remark of the Supreme Court, the Delhi
High Court saw a fresh impetus in PILs filed by middle-class Resident Welfare
Associations to remove 'encroachments' on public land in their vicinity. The
trajectory of a typical PIL for slum clearance would be as follows: a Resident
Welfare Association (RWA) would file a  _writ petition_ in the High Court, praying
for the removal of a neighbouring slum, alleging nuisance caused to them by its
very existence. The court would grant the RWA's prayer, and the matter would only
end when the landowning agency of the encroached public land abided by the
court's direction of demolition and relocation of a slum.[^4/16]

The procedural departures that the Delhi High Court was making in its PIL
jurisdiction in these RWA cases can be best gleaned from a comparison with
another case from another time and another city, but in the same jurisdiction.
A remarkably similar petition to these Delhi RWA petitions had been filed in
Ahmedabad in 1984, complaining of 'nuisance on account of emission of smoke,
passing of urine on public street by the hutment dwellers who are residing in
this area'. The case, however, was then dismissed by the Gujarat High Court ---
not because of the affluence of the PIL petitioners and the poverty of the slum
dwellers, or any similarly ideologically inflected arguments, but for good old-fashioned
procedural reasons:

>(1) As to whether there is encroachment or not is a _question of fact_ and it
>is difficult to ascertain in a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution
>as to who has caused encroachment. This cannot be determined without
>recording evidence and without allowing the parties to lead evidence.
>Normally this Court would not adopt this course in a petition under
>Art. 226.
>
>(2) The persons who are alleged to have made encroachment and who
>are alleged to be residing in hutments are not parties in this petition.
>Without hearing them no order which may adversely affect them can
>be passed.[^4/17]

These kinds of legal arguments were given no play in the Delhi High Court of
the twenty-first century. In hardly any of these RWA cases were the slum dwellers,
who were to be evicted, made parties to the case at the court's instance and heard
by it.[^4/18] In fact, ordinarily, the name of the slum was not even mentioned by the
court in its orders in these cases. They were simply designated 'encroachers' and
ordered to be removed. In many instances, the first time they would only hear
about the court order when the bulldozers would enter their colony. Omission of
a 'necessary party' from civil proceedings, like the slum dwellers here obviously are,
would ordinarily be considered 'non-joinder of parties'. This is a fundamental rule
of civil procedure, also applicable to _writ jurisdiction_, under which all PIL cases
are filed. A judgment of the Supreme Court in 1984 had clearly laid down the law
on this issue:

>A High Court ought not to hear and dispose of a  _writ petition_ under Article
**226** of the Constitution without the persons who would be vitally affected
by its judgment being before it as respondents or at least some of them being
before it as respondents in a representative capacity if their number is too
large to join them as respondents individually, and, if the petitioners refuse to
so join them, the High Court ought to dismiss the petition for non-joinder
of necessary parties.[^4/19]

But such 'technical' or 'legalistic' arguments, which still had appeal in the early
1980s even in PIL cases, stopped enjoying the same valence by the early twenty-first
century as the radiating effects of the ideological onslaught against procedural
formalism by the votaries of PIL had by then infected the entire appellate judiciary.

Similarly, the other procedural issue here, the _question of fact_ regarding the
alleged 'nuisance' caused by 'encroachers' was never really examined and adjudicated
by the Delhi High Court in these slum demolition PILs. The only 'evidence'
that the court would rely on to initiate such eviction was photographs showing
the nuisance caused by the slum dwellers.[^4/20] Such impressionistic 'evidence' was
deemed to be adequate by the court in such cases. Conventionally, the High Court
is not supposed to adjudicate upon questions of fact under the _writ jurisdiction_ of
Article 226, as there are practical difficulties because the court normally just relies
on affidavits. However, such a rigid position has been difficult to sustain as the
courts have inevitably needed to go into disputed _questions of fact_ to adjudicate
'public law litigation', as Abram Chayes famously called complex civil litigation on
issues of public law.[^4/21] While this is inevitable perhaps, Chayes had warned that
in such cases:

>The extended impact of the judgment demands a more visibly reliable
and credible procedure for establishing and evaluating the fact elements
in the litigation, and one that more explicitly recognizes the complex and
continuous interplay between fact evaluation and legal consequence.

Any such clarity on evidentiary procedure and standard of proof has, however,
not been forthcoming from the Indian PIL courts. As Sudhir Krishnaswamy has
argued in the context of another PIL that relied on scanty evidence, 'the broader
the factual claims sought to be relied on by a public law court, the greater the
burden of proof that will need to be discharged.'[^4/22] This situation is complicated
further by the fact that the principle of not adjudicating on _questions of fact_ in PIL
cases continues to be paid lip service to, leading to its opportunistic deployment
even in cases which are otherwise based on factual analysis.

By 2002, these RWA cases had reached such a scale that a High Court bench
was constituted that heard 63 such combined petitions under the lead petition
of _Pitampura Sudhar Samiti vs. Union of India_.[^4/23] The judgment summed up the
petitions as:

>Filed by various resident associations of colonies alleging that after
encroaching the public land, these JJ Clusters have been constructed in an
illegal manner and they are causing nuisance of varied kind for the residents
of those areas.[^4/24]

Interestingly, these 63 petitions were combined with another 'set of petitions
filed by or on behalf of JJ Clusters who either want to continue in the same
clusters and demand better facilities or are claiming their rehabilitation'. The
court dealt with the problem of slums as 'encroachments' by dividing the issue
into two aspects --- one being the removal of slums and the other that of their
rehabilitation as per government policies. What was deemed to be the second
issue --- the constitutionality of rehabilitation of these slum dwellers --- was
relegated to another bench, as we shall soon see. Meanwhile, the court accepted
the RWAs' contentions, reasoning that 'humanitarianism must be distinguished
from miscarriage of mercy ... these residential colonies were developed first. The
slums have been created afterwards which is the cause of nuisance and brooding
ground of so many ills.'[^4/25]

The governmental failure to provide minimum facilities like public toilets
for slum dwellers and the resulting nuisance caused by public defecation was
to be solved by removing the slum itself, not by making the government provide
those facilities.[^4/26] The court also rejected the slum dwellers' petitions saying, 'Since
they are encroachments of public land and are unauthorised occupants of public
premises at public places, they have no legal right to maintain such a Petition.'[^4/27]

The government's existing policy requiring the provision of alternative land
before demolishing a slum was dealt with soon after this in a most astonishing
judgment given by a two-judge bench of the Delhi High Court on 29 November 2002 in a PIL filed by the Okhla Factory Owners' Association.[^4/28] The judgment
continued in the vein of Justice Kirpal's 'pickpocket' remark, quoting it for support
'against the grant of indulgence to such encroachers' and went a long way further
to delegimitize any need for relocation of 'encroachers' as a prerequisite for
demolishing their houses. The judgment set the tone with its very first sentence:
'Benevolence in administration is a necessity but this benevolence has to be
balanced against the rights of the residents of a town specially when dealing with
one commodity which can never increase which is land.' After having cast the issue
as the 'rights' of some versus 'benevolence' towards others, the court examined the
legality of the government policy of allotting land to squatters as 'this problem of
relocation of _jhuggi_ dwellers was arising in a number of cases where public interest
petitions were filed to clear public land'. The court went on to not only do away
with the requirement of relocation, it actually declared it illegal even where it
was possible. Providing alternative sites, according to the court, was self-defeating
and 'it has only created a mafia of property developers and builders who have
utilized this policy to encourage squatting on public land, get alternative sites
and purchase them to make further illegal constructions', the court speculated. 'A
populist measure need not necessarily be a legal one', said the court. This P-word
would thus appear repeatedly in such cases.

The court raised a statistical spectre by spelling out the amount required
for providing minimum housing to the estimated 3 million _jhuggi_-dwellers
of Delhi --- about 59.25 billion rupees (the largeness of the figure was subtly
underlined by enunciating it in all its numerical splendour, with the requisite
zeroes). Finally, after evaluating the speed at which rehabilitation had taken
place in the past, the court stated that at this rate, it would take 272 years to
resettle Delhi's existing slum dwellers. The court, thus, managed to ridicule
the slum policy and made it seem impractical and impossible. The court finally
managed to reach the conclusion that any rehabilitation by the government
under its slum policy would itself be illegal. The logic of the judgment followed
what Pratap Bhanu Mehta later called 'the jurisprudence of exasperation'. As
Mehta explains:

>The function of law in this view is to express, both literally and figuratively,
exasperation at the state of affairs ... it expresses a certain impatience with
reality ... Much in our society would prompt us to tear our hair out in
exasperation. Judges now see it as their job to give these sentiments expression
in law.[^4/29]

Where these millions of slum-dwelling people would go once evicted from
their homes and why they were there in the first place was of no concern to
the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court. Anticipating the catastrophic
repercussions of such a change in policy, both the central and state governments
in Delhi went on to appeal the Supreme Court, which stayed this High Court
order and allowed the government's slum policy and allotment of land for
relocation to continue, provided it clearly specified 'that the allotment would
be subject to the result of the petitions'.[^4/30] Until 7 September 2010, when the
Supreme Court finally set aside the High Court judgment,[^4/31] all schemes for
allotment of land to slum dwellers in Delhi carried this proviso.[^4/32]

The two judgments of the Delhi High Court discussed above --- _Pitampura
Sudhar Samiti_ and _Okhla Factory Owners Association_ --- turned out to be the last real
instances of reflection on moral and constitutional questions faced by the court
vis-à-vis slum demolitions, for the next seven years.[^4/33] What the courts delivered
after this were orders, not judgments; that is, no reasoned justifications were
forthcoming, just pure assertions of power. Henceforth, the court concentrated
on creating a machinery for slum demolition and went on to, as we shall see,
oversee the process itself. But already, in the _Okhla_ judgment, the looseness of
legal language and the glaring incoherence of public reason had moved law
towards non-law. The judgment did not actually rely on legal principles, but
was based on the premise that a policy which seemed impractical based on past
experience can simply be declared unconstitutional. The reliance on legal norms
and reasoning is minimal, and the decision appears to be no more than a pure
assertion of sovereignty. Despite all this, such an ideological judgment was,
strictly speaking, possible to envisage as part of a regular litigation challenging
the legality of Delhi Government's slum rehabilitation policy. What would soon
follow it, I argue, would just not have been possible in a non-PIL judiciary.

## The emergence of PIL as a slum demolition machine

After the judgment on the legality of slum rehabilitation as a general policy in
the _Okhla_ case, the High Court scheduled a hearing in the same case, ostensibly
to give further directions in respect of individual grievances made in the two
petitions relating to Wazirpur and Okhla, two specific industrial areas of Delhi.
This hearing, which took place on 3 March 2003, became the site of an awesome
display of judicial power through the means of PIL, setting the pace for court-led
slum demolitions in Delhi over the next five years, on a scale for which the only
precedent was the Emergency. It marked a new phase in the courts' relation with
slums in Delhi.

The important departure here was one of geography. Although the relevant
petitions were specific to two areas --- Wazirpur and Okhla --- the court decided
not to be limited by such constraints and took the petition's concerns regarding
'encroachments' to a new location altogether --- to the banks of the river Yamuna,
the site of what was then the largest slum in Delhi, Yamuna Pushta. There was
no justification for this bizarre segue other than the judges' own whims. To read
Justice Vijender Jain's order, it was as if the Supreme Court had never passed a
stay order on the High Court judgment about the slum rehabilitation policy ---
the High Court carried on as if resettlement was no longer necessary before a
slum was demolished. In this order of 3 March 2003, after gleefully recounting
the statistics based on which the _Okhla_ judgment had been given, Jain suddenly
moved into unconnected terrain:

>What is required to be done in the present situation in this never ending
drama of illegal encroachment in this capital city of our Republic? ... Yamuna
Bed and both the sides of the river have been encroached by unscrupulous
persons with the connivance of the authorities. Yamuna Bed as well as its
embankment has to be cleared from such encroachments ... In view of the
encroachment and construction of _jhuggies_/_pucca_ structure in the Yamuna
Bed and its embankment with no drainage facility, sewerage water and other
filth are discharged in Yamuna water ... We therefore direct all the authorities
concerned ... to forthwith remove all the unauthorized structures, _jhuggies_,
places of worship and/or any other which are unauthorisedly put in Yamuna
Bed and its embankment, within two months from today.[^4/34]

The court here made its own accusations, came up with its own facts and
ordered its own remedy, without feeling the need to hear anybody else. Additionally,
it made an unsubstantiated correlation between slums near the river and pollution
caused to it by them. In fact, research by a reputed non-profit organization called
Hazards Centre found that the slums near the Yamuna contributed less than 1% of the total sewage released into the river.[^4/35] The PIL petition was just an
excuse for the court to dwell on its own hobby horses.

In another key move that Justice Jain would repeatedly come to make in
such PIL cases, he appointed an _amicus curiae_ to assist the court in this case.[^4/36]
The petitioners may have had specific complaints for which they had come to
court, but the court had its own concerns which it intended to go ahead and set
right through the same petition. To do so, it needed to appoint its own lawyer, the
_amicus curiae_.

Finally, although the target of the court's intervention was Delhi's largest
slum cluster, 'Yamuna Pushta', it was never referred to by name in its order. This
refusal, too, became part of the judicial style of these PILs as patented by Justice
Jain. Perhaps the judge did not wish to dignify the 'encroachers' by giving a name
to their settlement. His decision also added to the opacity of the proceedings,
and over the one year or so that it took for this order to be implemented, no
resident or representative organization of the Yamuna settlements was ever made
a party to the case. But the implication of such a widely worded order against all
encroachments on the river Yamuna could be quite radical, as would be evident
in a few years.

Yamuna Pushta, meaning 'embankment on the river Yamuna' was actually a
series of slum colonies on the banks of the river behind Old Delhi. The colonies
had different names, such as Gautampuri-I, Gautampuri-II, Kanchanpuri, Indira
Colony and Sanjay Amar Colony, and altogether housed about 1,50,000 people.[^4/37]

When this case next came up for substantive hearing on 29 October 2003, it
was heard by a different bench of the High Court. Though this new bench was keen
to implement the _Okhla_ order of removing the slums mentioned in the petition
without any need for relocation, it also noted with some apparent surprise that

>\[W\]hile hearing the matter on 3.3.2003, it appears that the Division Bench
also took the cognizance of encroachers on Yamuna. The petition pertains
to encroachment in Wazirpur area. Therefore, Registry is directed to give
a separate number to the petition as the Court has taken cognizance on its
own motion and to place the copy of the order passed by the Division Bench
on 3.3.2003.

Such departures from basic legal procedures in PILs still surprised other
judges of the High Court, though with Justice Jain having taken the lead, such
judicial improvization would not be exceptional for very long.

The new petition of which the court had taken cognizance was numbered
Civil _Writ Petition_ 689/2004 and was called _Court on its own Motion vs. Union of
India_. With _Senior Advocate_ Amarjit Singh Chandhiok as the _amicus curiae_, this
newly numbered _writ petition_ came up before a new bench on 28 January 2004.
The order on 3 March 2003 which sparked off this new _writ_ was about the removal
of encroachments from Yamuna. Strangely enough, notice of this new case was
accepted on behalf of the Central Government by the Tourism Ministry and not
the Ministry of Urban Development, which is responsible for the lawful planned
development of Delhi and ordinarily deals with such cases. This was because the
Tourism Minister was Jagmohan, the architect of the infamous Emergency-era
demolitions, who was now most keen to resume his reputation as 'demolition
man'.[^4/38]

By the time the next hearing came around, in February 2004, Jagmohan had
quickly manufactured a grand plan to develop the Yamuna riverfront after the
anticipated removal of these slum clusters. The plan was to develop a 100-acre
strip of land on the banks of the river Yamuna, 'into a riverside promenade with
parks and fountains which would be marketed as a major tourist attraction'.[^4/39] This
was circulated as a brochure before the court and was called, 'Yamuna River Front:
Undoing a tragedy of governance and ushering in a new dawn', with nine pages
of glossy uncaptioned photographs of the Pushta showing industrial activities like
'electro-plating units' being carried on there, as well as photographs of homes
with TV sets asking if these were homes of the 'poor'.[^4/40] The court was persuaded
by Jagmohan's rhetoric. In particular, it was agitated by the photographs showing
the presence of industries in the Pushta and ordered the immediate clearing of
all legal hurdles for the demolition of Yamuna Pushta.[^4/41] Between February and
May 2004, the Yamuna Pushta slums were finally destroyed under court orders.[^4/42]
About 6,000 of the 35,000 families displaced were resettled by the government 25 miles away in Bawana, at the extreme Northern edge of the National Capital
Territory of Delhi.[^4/43] Even after the demolitions in Yamuna Pushta, the _suo
motu_ case regarding encroachments on the river Yamuna continued. The court
kept ordering demolitions of other slums near the river. It also came up with a
novel interpretation to speed up the process and pre-empt the need for a Slum
Rehabilitation Policy in this case. 'It is required to be noted', said the Court:

>That the policy of DDA for relocation would not apply to the river bed. It
is not an encroachment on land. It is a water body and it is required to be
maintained as a water body by the DDA and all other authorities.[^4/44]

A few months after this order, Justice Vijender Jain took charge of this case.
Over the course of the year that he presided over it, he took it to another level
with his innovations and determination to demolish as many slums as possible.
Dissatisfied with the authorities' less than complete implementation of his original
_suo motu_ order on Yamuna encroachments (he would quote his original order in
subsequent orders repeatedly), and 'in the absence of a comprehensive policy by the
Government ... to clear the Yamuna bed and its embankment.' On 16 November
2005, he decided to create a special judicial mechanism for this purpose. Jain ordered
the constitution of a Monitoring Committee chaired by a retired High Court
Judge, Usha Mehra, 'to remove such encroachment forthwith and to monitor such
operations'. The Committee consisted of highly placed ex-officio members,[^4/45] the
_amicus_ Chandhiok and a retired Additional District Judge S. M. Aggarwal, who
was appointed as Convenor. The Committee was to submit a monthly report 'with
regard to action taken in terms of order passed' on 3 March 2003.

This Committee, which came to be known as the 'Yamuna --- Removal of
Encroachment Monitoring Committee', was initially set up for a period of one
year, but its tenure was later extended indefinitely.[^4/46] Its members were given office
space in the swanky India Habitat Centre. The Monitoring Committee appointed
soon after by the Supreme Court in the 'sealing case', discussed in Chapter 2,
functioned from the adjoining office. Having already zeroed in on encroachments
as the cause of pollution in the river Yamuna and without any further discussion on
other possible causes of such pollution, on the next date of hearing on 8 December
2005, Justice Jain ordered:

> We direct the Committee to take up in right earnestness and on day-today
basis the task of removing encroachments upto 300 meters from both
sides of River Yamuna in the first instance. No encroachment either in
the form of _jhuggi--jhopri_ clusters or in any other manner by any person or
organization shall be permitted ... We make it clear that the Committee will
take up the task of removal of illegal encroachment on the basis of directions
issued above and will not entertain any request for grant of any time for such
removal on the pretext of relocation or any other alternative allotment ...
Illegal occupants of the river bed did not have the right to pollute the river
and if there was a policy to relocate or rehabilitate them somewhere else, the
eviction measure would not wait for such a policy to be implemented.

The court did not provide any basis for arriving at the figure of 300 metres, but
it became a benchmark of sorts, with government authorities soon turning it into
some kind of a sacrosanct limit.[^4/47] The court had effectively set up the machinery for
efficient implementation of its commands. This PIL came up regularly before the
court for the next one year, and its orders discussed the monthly reports submitted
by the Monitoring Committee to the court, which contained an account of the
progress made by the various government agencies in removing encroachments
from the river bed. The Committee made frequent inspection of the areas in
question and reported to the court. This improvisation by the court ensured that
all government agencies followed the directions of the court and it could micro-manage
the whole affair. The court would direct a senior officer of the government to
be present in the court to make sure it performed, or recall the order requiring him
to be present in court if there was a good progress report from the Committee.[^4/48]
Any further legal obstacles were removed by the court on 29 March 2006, when
it ordered 'all the courts subordinate to the Delhi High Court not to deal with
any matter with regard to grant of stay against removal of illegal encroachers from
the river embankment'. To further systematize the slum demolition campaign, the
court asked the DDA to submit 'area-wise sketch plans showing clusters of _jhuggis_
and other structures on various parts of Western embankment of the river Yamuna'.
In the absence of any such plans, the Committee was asked to arrange for 'satellite
mapping instrument and technology', so as 'to have the mapping of all the _jhuggi_
clusters and other structures on the western embankment on Yamuna river'.

The Yamuna Monitoring Committee appointed by the court, in the first year
of its existence, was successful in removing 11,280 _jhuggies_ and _pucca_ structures,
including more than 130 _dhobi ghats_,[^4/49] from various places on both banks of
the river Yamuna. This was hailed as 'tremendous work' by Justice Jain and the
Committee's term was extended for another year. Most of the settlements were
demolished within the first five months of the committee's establishment, the
biggest of its actions being the removal of 4,000 _jhuggies_ situated in East Delhi,
near Geeta Colony on the eastern embankment of the river Yamuna. Justice Jain
would later tell me in an interview that he was particularly proud of having cleared
this area, as a massive clover-leaf flyover and grade-separator came up there later,
which he thought was one of his achievements and resented the fact that he was
not invited for its inauguration a few years later.[^4/50] Indeed, throughout this period,
all kinds of ambitious road projects adjoining the river were given the green signal.

After Justice Jain left the Delhi High Court in November 2006, this PIL took
a completely different and unanticipated direction. The Commonwealth Games
was to be held in Delhi in 2010, for which purpose a massive Games Village was
planned right on the floodplains of the river Yamuna. As this would violate the
blanket directions that the court had previously given in this case against _any and
all_ construction near the river, a different PIL filed against the Games Village
was referred to the same Committee. The Convenor of the Committee, perhaps
naively believing in the blanket mandate of the Committee to actually cover all
illegal structures, and not just slums and such sub-standard constructions, actually
interceded with the High Court against the Commonwealth Games Village.
The High Court bench in 2008 found grave illegalities in the process of granting
permissions for the Games Village and ordered a committee to examine this issue,
without stopping its construction, which was going full steam ahead. But even this
committee was declared unnecessary by the Supreme Court when it came up for
appeal. The Supreme Court cleared the Games Village Project: the PIL against it,
said the judges, had been filed too late in the day.

The _Yamuna_ case is a perfect example of what had by then become a definite
judicial trend: that of turning a PIL filed about a specific problem in a specific
part of the city into what I call an omnibus PIL: a PIL that deals with a particular
issue 'wherever it comes up in the city'. The city was the level at which the court
was thinking of the problem. The device of the omnibus PIL was deployed in
particularly spectacular fashion by the High Court from 2003 onwards, with Justice
Vijender Jain being its arch exponent. The whole city was thus made subject to
judicial intervention and correction through this process. What was relatively new
about this increasingly common and extremely powerful form of PIL was that the
specific aggrieved party was removed, and a roving enquiry into the whole city
conducted by the court through the _amicus_. To rely, therefore, on the language of the
petitions to understand the nature of these PILs, as many commentators continue
to do, is not particularly useful as the petitioners had little if any role to play in these
cases by this point.

The means by which the city was made legible for this new optics of the court
was usually the Delhi Master Plan that provided for strict zoning laws. Through
this new manoeuver, PIL became a means to target the 'illegal' residents of the city,
who until then had been protected by their elected representatives. These 'illegal'
citizens were not even made party to the proceedings. All problems were blamed
on the conspicuous urban poor, who were seen as obstructing the neat solutions
proposed to make the city come up to scratch as a 'global city': they would simply
have to go as collateral damage.

That the poor were there in the first place was a function of what Partha
Chatterjee has called 'political society'. These people had been accommodated,
however precariously, by the everyday populist politics that depended on them for
electoral support. These were the networks most drastically unravelled by this new
phase of PIL. The omnibus PIL and its procedural improvizations enabled the
court to monitor and micro-manage nearly every aspect of the city's governance
and make the whole city the direct object of its reformative attention. We have
seen in the course of this chapter the move made by RWAs and other mediating
actors as PIL petitioners asking the court to intervene and set the city right by
cleaning up the excesses of political society. By 2003, it was as if the court no
longer needed any external crutch to do this. It went about doing it on its own.
Indeed, the effectiveness and thoroughness with which the Delhi High Court
could pursue slum demolitions through its new machinery far exceeded the
abilities of individual RWAs.

***

Another example of a Justice-Jain-style omnibus PIL that significantly
changed the city is the case referred to as _Hem Nalini Mehra vs. Government
of NCT of Delhi_.[^4/51] This was a PIL filed in 2002 by the residents of two group
housing societies in East Delhi, complaining of the callousness of the government
authorities in not carrying out the requisite sewer repair work and laying of an
arterial road. The court managed to get the repairs done in a year's time. But
once this was done, at the hearing on 31 October 2003, the court decided to
expand the scope of the _writ petition_ to road repair and road safety all over Delhi
and made Pushkar Sood, the lawyer for the PIL petitioners, the _amicus curiae_
in this omnibus PIL. Over the next three years, the court in this PIL set up a
centralized database of fatal accidents and a mechanism for cancelling driving
licences of people involved in such cases. It demolished slum clusters, removed
street vendors and kiosks as encroachment on public roads and footpaths,[^4/52] closed
down unregulated automobile repair shops, ordered the move of wholesale paper
and chemical markets to peripheral areas, ordered new interstate bus terminals to
be set up in two peripheral areas of the city, ordered the construction of 14 multi-level
parking lots for the decongestion of traffic in Delhi, ordered the installation
of bollards (concrete separators) on roads and supervised the construction of
flyovers (going into the details of alignment in the case of a clover-leaf flyover
near Akshardham temple), underpasses and traffic lights near them.

Another omnibus PIL championed by Justice Jain was the case of _Hemraj vs.
Commissioner of Police_.[^4/53] The PIL was originally filed in 1999 to curtail goods traffic
on the roads in and around the Chattarpur temple in South Delhi. But soon after
this complaint was dealt with, the PIL was expanded to deal with 'proper handling
of traffic and related problems in the entire city of Delhi' and a committee with exofficio
members and two _amicus curiae_[^4/54] appointed by the court, which came to be
called 'the _Hemraj _Amicus Curiae_ Committee_'. By the time it was folded up by a
new bench in 2008, this PIL and its committee had been handling the issue of traffic
congestion in the entire city for almost a decade. It did all that the _Hem Nalini Mehra_
PIL did and more, and ordered its share of slum demolitions. The most well known
among the slum settlements demolished in this case was Nangla Machi, comprising
about 2,800 houses in Central Delhi.[^4/55] Among other reasons, this settlement irked
the court because 'the unauthorised occupants also have buffaloes and other animals
which not only give way to unhygenic conditions but also create hindrance on the
smooth flow of commuters on the ring road of Delhi which are in thousands'.[^4/56] The
High Court's final order to demolish this settlement on 5 April 2006 explained:

>It is clear that these persons have no legal right to occupy the land in question,
they should be removed and if they are entitled for any relocation, then that
entitlement will be seen by the authority concerned. However, the removal
will not wait for the relocation.

At no point during these court proceedings were the slum dwellers of Nangla
Machi given a chance to be heard in the case.[^4/57]

On May 17 2006, Justice Jain ordered a massive crackdown on cycle-rickshaws
in Delhi in the _Hemraj_ case. The order began with a tirade against the
'plying of cycle rickshaws on the main roads, narrow roads and congested roads'
which the Court said, 'has become a horrible experience'. It then directed the
MCD not to grant any licenses in future for plying cycle rickshaws on Delhi
roads and also ordered it to prohibit cycle rickshaws from plying on all arterial
roads in the city. This would hit the livelihood of hundreds of thousands in a
city with an estimated 0.6 million cycle rickshaws.[^4/58] The court's impatience with
the continued proliferation of cycle rickshaws in Delhi clearly seemed to emerge
from a feeling of lack or a sense of embarrassment about the inadequately modern
nature of the cycle rickshaw. In the most bizarre intervention to make real its
fantasy of a truly modern city, the court in this same omnibus PIL ordered a
ban on the plying of cycle rickshaws in the Chandni Chowk area at the behest
of a traders' association in the Walled City of Delhi.[^4/59] Chandni Chowk is the
commercial heart of the Walled City. Having banned cycle rickshaws between
Red Fort Chowk and Fatehpuri Mosque in order to reduce congestion there so
that the entire area 'is reglorified and people are able to do hassle free shopping in
an atmosphere of quality environment', it ordered the introduction of CNG buses
as an alternative. Since the order was given with respect to a much fetishized and
touristed part of Delhi, which is so obviously suited to non-motorized vehicles
like cycle rickshaws,[^4/60] its manifest absurdity attracted a lot of attention. The New
York-based Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) issued
a statement that read:

>We believe that for the court to make policy regarding road use is beyond its
competence and judicial mandate ... because roads are a public good, ultimately
the use and allocation of scarce road space should be determined by a legitimate
democratic political process informed by in-depth technical understanding.[^4/61]

## The Kalyan Sanstha case: The slum demolition machine perfected

>Looking back now, it's hard to map out everything that happened after the 14
>December 2005 Delhi High Court order that called for the demolition of all
>unauthorized constructions in Delhi. The _todh-phodh_, as the regulars at
>Bara Tooti called it, spread rapidly across the city as the Municipal Corporation's
>demolition teams fanned out into markets and residential colonies ...
>
> --- Aman Sethi, _A Free Man_[^4/62]

The next giant move in this logical progression of the Delhi High Court presiding
over the remaking of the city was to combine all the PIL cases relating to
'unauthorised construction, misuse of properties and encroachments on public
land' into one master case, eventually dealing with the entire city. The history of
this case tells us something about the trajectory of PIL in Delhi.

In 1989, in the middle-class neighbourhood of West Patel Nagar, a post-Partition
'rehabilitation colony', there was a dispute between two neighbours living
in adjacent plots of 200 square yards each, leading one of them, Sarla Sabharwal,
to file a  _writ petition_ in the Delhi High Court alleging that her neighbour was
constructing extra floors on his property, which would exceed the municipal building
by-laws and, therefore, asking the court to order the MCD to take action against
him. The respondent neighbour promptly countered the charge by submitting a list
of 32 buildings in the same neighbourhood that were also violating municipal rules
--- either by building more floors than permitted, or by using the residential premises
for commercial purposes, or by extending the building on land beyond that allotted
to them, and thus encroaching on public land, i.e. on the road on both sides of
the building. A bench headed by Justice Kirpal heard this writ. This was the same
judge who 10 years later in the Supreme Court gave the 'encroacher as pickpocket'
judgment. In 1990, the judges declared that this was a 'fit issue ... in which public is
interested' and decided to regard this case as a PIL. In 1991, the court disposed of
the case with orders to the MCD vis-à-vis 27 buildings in the area that were found
to contain legal violations, to either 'regularize' illegalities which were compoundable
and demolish those which were not compoundable. This order, and indeed the whole
PIL, was restricted to middle-class houses in Patel Nagar and Rajinder Nagar areas
of Karol Bagh zone of the MCD in West Delhi.

Twelve years later, the husband of the petitioner in the earlier writ filed
a PIL in the Delhi High Court in the name of a 'social welfare organization'
called 'Kalyan Sanstha',[^4/63] which had never been heard of before or after, and of
which he said he was the president. The petition alleged that the punitive actions
for the West Delhi neighbourhoods ordered by the High Court in the earlier
petition filed by his wife had not been implemented by the MCD, and the
unauthorized constructions there had gone from bad to worse. The case plodded
along for its first two years. On 30 November 2005, it suddenly acquired a
completely different valence, when it got listed before a bench headed by Justice
Vijender Jain.

Jain decided to deploy this case to start a demolition drive in Delhi. He
summoned official figures of unauthorized construction for all of Delhi: there
were a total of 18,299 recorded cases of unauthorized construction in the city over
a period of five years. 'To check the mushrooming of unauthorized construction',
he wanted these demolished forthwith 'in right earnest'. On 14 December, the
court issued a clarification:

>We are making it clear that MCD has to launch a drive throughout Delhi in
terms of our directions passed in this matter. There are other _writ petitions_ ...
which relate to other areas. A copy of this order shall be placed on all the
files so that the MCD shall start its working in right earnest. We are further
making it clear that if there is any other area or locality in which there are
buildings which do not conform to the parameters of building by-laws ... the
same shall be covered by order passed.

The demolition drive was on. From this date onwards, all other cases
pending in the Delhi High Court relating to 'Unauthorized construction, Misuse
of Properties and encroachments on Public Land' were to be heard under this
omnibus PIL of _Kalyan Sanstha Social Welfare Organization vs. Union of India
& Ors_ (Civil _Writ Petition_ 4582/2003). The MCD panicked at the enormity at
the task before it and stated in a sworn affidavit that out of the approximately 4
million properties in Delhi, 3 million are 'in violation of law', i.e. 70--80%
of buildings constructed in Delhi are unauthorized. The court was livid and called
this 'an attempt to create fear psychosis in the mind of honest citizens' and made
the government 'delete' the statement saying it was not based on any exact survey.

After 18 January 2006, when its order noted that the 'demolition drive has
been undertaken in Delhi but it has been far from satisfactory', the court started
thinking of alternatives. Before it, was the example of the 'sealing case' in the
Supreme Court, which had taken a new dimension in February 2006, as we saw
in Chapter 2.[^4/64] Observing that '\[i\]t seems that the MCD lacks the desire to check
the rampant corruption and unauthorized construction', the High Court took the
first step towards forging its own tools to oversee the implementation machinery
of the demolition drive on 23 March. It appointed four lawyers of the Delhi High
Court as 'Court Commissioners' for four of the twelve municipal zones of the city.
The Court Commissioners were supposed to act as the 'eyes and ears of the court'
and were directed 'to keep a vigil in these zones and take periodical inspections
and wherever unauthorized construction is going on, they may note the number
of the property and immediately inform the Commissioner of MCD.' The court
also authorized the Court Commissioners 'to inspect the premises at the localities
in their respective zones and to see whether in a residential area any commercial
activity is being carried out' and if so, to inform the Commissioner of Police 'for
immediate action'. The Commissioner of the MCD was to accordingly file an
'action taken report' before the court stating that the unauthorized construction/misuse
reported by the Court Commissioner has been removed. The names of
these Court Commissioners along with their telephone numbers and addresses
were published in the newspapers on the orders of the court 'so that any citizen
or resident welfare association if they want to contact the Court Commissioners
can contact them and the Court Commissioners can take cognizance of such
complaints'. An apparatus was thus set up whereby the RWAs need no longer
approach the Court to lodge complaints but could just go to its agents, the Court
Commissioners, who would inform the MCD and/or the police, who would then
file an 'Action Taken Report' before the Court.

When the first 'public notice' regarding the 'Appointment of Court
Commissioners' appeared in the newspapers on 5 April 2006, there was
interestingly no mention of 'illegal encroachments on public land'. It was limited
to 'unauthorized constructions' and 'commercialization of residential premises'.
This was soon to change. Like Justice Jain's other omnibus PILs, this too, the
largest of them, would soon principally target slums. Such a choice was particularly
glaring in this case, as the whole history of the PIL was about rampant middle-class
illegality and its peculiar manifestations, but as always, the slums were the
easiest target. The cross-mediation that was observable in most instances of slum-demolition
at this time --- the court ordering demolition, the media egging it on
and the RWAs acting as the local agents of the court --- was perhaps at its most
developed in this case.

But before that stage was reached, the court's apparatus was refined further.
On 18 May 2006, selected lawyers were appointed as Court Commissioners
for all the 12 municipal zones of Delhi. Finding it 'difficult to monitor day-to-day
activities of this magnitude', the court appointed a Monitoring Committee
consisting of two retired senior policemen and another _ex-officio_ senior policeman
still in service, 'to monitor all the directions which have been given in this _writ
petition_ by this Court and also to carry out, implement and execute the directions
passed by this Court'. The whole apparatus was ready now. The court had acquired
the means to find the illegalities in the city and set them right. The RWA as the
PIL petitioner at the demand end and the MCD at the supply end were just nodes
for the court to do the right thing and clean the city up.

The Monitoring Committee was officially advertised in the newspapers as
'constituted by Hon'ble High Court, Delhi, regarding Unauthorised Construction,
Misuse of Properties & Encroachment on Public land'.[^4/65] The Monitoring
Committee started submitting monthly reports to the court, on the basis of which
the court passed orders. 'Illegal encroachments on public land' soon became the
focus and 'public land' was increasingly understood in terms of its real estate value.
This perspective is evident from the court's order dated 25 August 2006, when the
Monitoring Committee was still in its early days:

>The report of the Monitoring Committee has been placed before us. It
has been stated in the report that because of the relentless efforts of the
Court Commissioners, encroachment on public land measuring more than
7,96,200 square yards having market value of more than Rs.500 crores[^4/66] on
the basis of a very conservative estimate have been retrieved by the MCD/DDA
from the encroachers and unauthorized occupants. The Monitoring
Committee has advised to the Commissioner, MCD and the Vice Chairman
DDA to get the cases of _criminal trespass_ registered under the IPC against
those individual.

The court would periodically give itself and its agents these self-congratulatory
pats on the back, and the media would join the celebratory chorus. On 22 March
2007, the _Hindustan Times_ carried a full page story to celebrate the first anniversary
of the appointments of the first four Court Commissioners and quoted a figure
from a Monitoring Committee report: 'In a joint effort under the guidance of
the court-appointed Monitoring Committee, the commissioners have helped the
government reclaim public land worth around `7,000 crore from the encroachers
over the past one year.' The Monitoring Committee members are quoted as saying
in a status report, 'The commissioners have done a wonderful job ... The MCD and
the DDA are, therefore, richer by thousands of crores.'

Much of the time during the court hearings went in the sparring between the
court-appointed authorities and the governmental authorities. The Monitoring
Committee would place its report, present its achievements and point out
persistent obstacles to demolition in various areas. The court would pull up the
respective governmental authority. The state would appear as the wrongdoer on
the other side of the law. Both sides would be trying to speak for the public. The
state would be seen as speaking for 'political society' and, therefore, characterized
by the court and its agents as enmeshed in the toleration of illegality. Meanwhile,
the court and its officials would represent themselves as speaking for civil society.
The lawyers for the parties affected would barely get time to have their concerns
heard. In this free-for-all, the high-profile lawyers ordinarily representing some
cases of 'unauthorized construction' and other elite illegalities would be the only
ones who had any chance of getting relief. Cases of subaltern illegalities cast as
'encroachments on public land' would have little or no chance even to be heard.
In the rare situations when they did appear because at some _pro bono_ lawyer's
initiative, the court would provide new and remarkable legal arguments to ensure
they enjoyed no legal protection.

By mid-2006, the court was finding it difficult to control the size of the case.
Its orders became increasingly opaque and difficult to decipher. The orders would
often read as some variation of the following, 'The xx Report of the Monitoring
Committee is filed. xx acres of public land is encroached in xx area. Action
taken report to be filed by the Municipal authorities on xx date.' Perhaps the
court was being euphemistic, but since the relevant Report itself was not in the
public domain, it was impossible to know from the order itself what action was
actually to be taken. There was no possibility of availing data from the Monitoring
Committee regarding its proceedings and recommendations, even if one was
directly affected.[^4/67] Police officers had been appointed to man the Committee and
they ran it with as little transparency as any police department.

The attention of this case had by then been successfully turned to Justice Jain's
old area of interest --- slum demolitions. On 12 October 2006, the court noted
some new insights regarding slums in Delhi:

>The Monitoring Committee has also pointed out that J. J. clusters have
undergone sea change inasmuch as three to four storey buildings have come
up in place of _Jhuggies_ and several industrial and commercial establishments
are running therefrom. Time has come for the authorities in Delhi to
formulate a policy so as not only to stop these unauthorized trade activities
being run from these _Jhuggi Jhopri_ clusters but also in view of the fact that
the occupants who are themselves unauthorized cannot be permitted to raise
unauthorized, unplanned and hazardous structures thereby making Delhi a
complete slum.

In a truly remarkable sleight-of-hand that could only have come from a deeply
held prejudice (in the most literal sense of that word), the court had deemed a
slum to no longer be a slum because it had grown vertically --- but the proliferation
of these very 'non-slums' was blamed for making the city look like a slum!

The emergence of upward mobility (pun unintended) in Delhi slums was
used as a bogey to aid their demolition. By this time, the Delhi Laws (Special
Provisions) Act, 2006 had come into force, with its moratorium on court-ordered
sealing and demolitions. But the _Kalyan Sanstha_ bench led by Justice Jain found
ingenious ways to continue its exercise. On 16 November 2006, it did a bizarre
reading of the new Act, stating that 'the intention of the Parliament is clearly
discernible', it held that the moratorium could not be extended to unauthorized
_pucca_[^4/68] structures built on government land. There were very few slums in the
harsh environs of Delhi that did not have features that could be considered _pucca_.
Like Jagmohan had used photographs of slum houses with television sets to
delegitimize them as not being poor enough, Justice Jain's court, too, found that
the slums were not wretched enough and, therefore, did not deserve the sympathy
of the law. The Monitoring Committee soon sent out a circular to the municipal
authorities that:

>Those of the _Jhuggi Jhopri_ clusters which have undergone a change in
character and have been replaced by 2 (or) 3 storey tenements come under this
ruling and can no longer be entitled to the moratorium. They are, therefore,
liable to be demolished as has already been done in a few places in Delhi.[^4/69]

This was Justice Jain's last order in this case before he was transferred to
Chandigarh High Court as its Chief Justice.[^4/70] The new judge who arrived to head
the _Kalyan Sanstha_ bench, Chief Justice M. K. Sharma, continued the case in the
same vein. The enormity of the scale of this case soon meant it got listed every
week, eventually acquiring a fixed two-hour time slot on Wednesday afternoons
between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. Having subsumed all other cases against encroachment
on public land and unauthorized colonies in Delhi as per the orders of the court,
it had become a mammoth case, with literally hundreds of Civil Miscellaneous
Petitions (CMPs) being made part of it. Every person or organization affected
by the case would have to file a CM to be heard by the court. The scope of the
case was so large that people (or 'parties') affected in each hearing would be in
the hundreds. But, it was impossible for everybody to be heard, as two hours a
week was not enough for the scale of the case. It became difficult to physically
enter these courtrooms even for lawyers appearing in the case. The _Kalyan Sanstha_
hearings were held in courtrooms of enormous size --- rooms which had proper
seating for more than a 100 people --- and there still would not be even standing
room. Luckily for all concerned, these were centrally air-conditioned courtrooms.
The journalists who ordinarily sat in the fourth or fifth row of upholstered chairs
'behind' the lawyers would in this case actually sit 'in front of' the lawyers, often
right below the judges, next to the court-clerk --- as if to underline how major a
role they played in acting as cheerleaders for this case. One journalist would later
tell me how judges would often look at them when making particularly volatile
remarks like 'Catch the big fish', 'Close down the municipal corporation', or 'We
don't care about (municipal) councillors'. These provocative pronouncements
were made to be picked up by the media. And sure enough, they would often be
reported as big headlines on the front pages of major newspapers the next day.

Under Vijender Jain, the possibilities of PIL were explored to the fullest,
most gargantuan scale. As Pushkar Sood, one of the Court Commissioners in this
case, said admiringly to me in an interview, 'Vijender Jain's was the golden period
of PIL'.

## Epilogue

In 2008, the Delhi High Court got a new Chief Justice, A. P. Shah. Shah was
renowned as a left-liberal judge, and with the powers that accrued to his position, he
started cleaning the Augean stables. As the Chief Justice, he could completely reset
the tone of the Delhi High Court on PIL. As legal scholar Nick Robinson observes:

>The power to set benches is also given to High Court Chief Justices. Like
their counterpart in the Supreme Court, they have a strong say in controlling
their court's agenda. For example, in most High Courts, it's the Chief
Justice's bench that first hears public interest litigation (PIL). Consequently,
High Courts gain a reputation either as sympathetic or unsympathetic to
PILs based largely on the Chief Justice alone.[^4/71]

Most of Justice Vijender Jain's omnibus PILs, which had remained active
under Chief Justice M. K. Sharma, were finally terminated during Chief Justice
Shah's benevolent reign. _Hemraj_, _Hem Nalini Mehra_, the Yamuna encroachments
case --- all were disposed of by the High Court during this period. _Kalyan Sanstha_
was not fully disposed of under Shah, but was defanged with the disbanding of
the Monitoring Committee and the Court Commissioners in 2008. It was finally
disposed of in 2011.

In the omnibus PIL system, these cases were never meant to be closed. They
were to be kept perpetually pending so that the court could govern the city on
a continual basis --- whether it be unauthorized constructions, traffic congestion
or road safety. Justice Shah's PIL bench made a major departure from the earlier
trend by passing orders closing these cases, like in _Hemraj_, where the court stated:

>It appears to this Court that the continued monitoring of the implementation
of the earlier directions issued by this Court in these petitions is no longer
necessary ... Several directions have already been issued in these matters and
it is needless to reiterate them.

Some of Justice Jain's most egregious decisions, like the ban on cycle rickshaws,
were reviewed and set aside.[^4/72] The constituency which had had a field day during
Justice Jain's and Justice Sharma's time was despondent at this turn of events. As
a journalist who covered the High Court 'beat' for an English newspaper told
me, 'After this bench, \[I have had\] nothing newsworthy in last three weeks. Shah
makes no off the cuff remarks. When PILs like _Hemraj_ of 10--15 years vintage
were disposed by him, even the lawyers were shocked.'[^4/73] Another journalist
compared the new judges on the PIL bench to eunuchs.[^4/74] Such language reeking
of machismo in which PIL-watchers speak of PIL judges tells its own story.

There were other important developments. Some of the excesses committed
during Justice Jain's time finally came to light and could be legally recognized. The
sinister possibilities of _Kalyan Sanstha_'s Monitoring Committee were exposed in a
writ filed by displaced street vendors in a market in south Delhi.[^4/75] In this case, it
was proved that an oral order was passed by the Monitoring Committee in 2006
and communicated telephonically to the concerned MCD official for removing
'unauthorized encroachers' in Ramji Lal Market, without any order in writing
being given. This would pre-empt any legal action against the evictions, as no
paper trail would exist at all. Such kind of arbitrary functioning of the Monitoring
Committee had been speculated upon earlier, but it was now confirmed by the
High Court itself that the court-appointed Committee had been issuing oral orders
for evicting and demolishing 'unauthorized encroachers'. The only reason it was
found out was because the coordinator of the Monitoring Committee had written
to the MCD official reminding him about the earlier telephonic communication
and asking him for an Action Taken Report regarding the encroachments.

Justice Shah retired in February 2010. Soon the old PILs his bench had
ordered to be closed were attempted to be revived. For instance, there was a PIL
that had been filed by the Jangpura RWA in 2006 for 'the removal of unauthorized
constructions and encroachments', which had led to demolition of slums in the
Jangpura area in South-central Delhi in 2006--07. In July 2008, the RWA had
filed a new application before the High Court, asking for the demolition of all
remaining structures, including a mosque, used by the slum dwellers who were
said to be Bangladeshis. This application was listed before Justice Shah's bench,
who instead of ordering any further demolition, disposed of the PIL itself with
this order:

>Most of the unauthorised structures have been removed and there is a
boundary wall constructed to ensure that no further encroachments take
place. It is stated by the counsel for the Respondents \[MCD\] that any further
grievance that the Petitioner may have, including those made in the present
application, will be promptly looked into and appropriate action will be taken
thereon. In view of this statement, this Court does not consider it necessary
to continue to monitor the progress of the implementation of its directions.

In October 2010, with Justice Shah gone, this old PIL was revived through the
backdoor with a contempt case filed by the Jangpura RWA, alleging that the above
order by Shah in 2008 had ordered the MCD to take action against encroachments
in the area and they had not done so. The High Court, without issuing any notice
to the affected parties, immediately ordered the MCD to take action against the
encroachments and file a 'compliance affidavit'. Accordingly, on 12 January 2011,
the MCD demolished the mosque called Noor Masjid in Jangpura.[^4/76]

## Conclusion

In an interview conducted in January 2010, Justice Vijender Jain modestly
explained to me that a new dimension to judicial authority had emerged in
the period between 2003 and 2006, during his heyday. Just how right he was
would be evident by now. Judicial charisma has been an important genre in the
historiography of common law and the phenomena of heroic/diabolical judges
have long been central to its institutional histories. Judicial power, however, is
elevated to a whole different level thanks to the enormous powers that PIL
vests in a judge, making such a narrative even more apposite. While judges have
predilections like the rest of us, the rules of adjudication and court procedure act
as constraints they have to work within. PIL removes any such limitation. In nonPIL
individual cases, judges can decide between affected parties based on their
opinions but that can only go only so far and can hardly translate into the kind of
demolition drive that we see here. Because it is an entirely malleable jurisdiction,
PIL enables a judge like Vijender Jain to act programmatically and go to whatever
extent he might want to.

My principal aim here has been to display how effective the non-procedural
and arbitrary nature of PIL makes it to systematically bulldoze its way through the
slums, literally in this case. In the PIL cases I have discussed, the court can initiate
a case on any public issue on its own, appoint its own lawyer, introduce its own
machinery to investigate the issue and then order its own solutions to the issue at
the level of the entire state. My interest here is to demonstrate how the court can
effectively take over urban governance through PIL, rather than merely expose the
ideologically slanted nature of such judicial urban governance. The latter is clear
enough and it's easy to look at judicial discourse and expose their biases, which are
writ large in their pronouncements. The real issue is the unprecedented efficacy
of PIL in pursuing such an agenda, thanks to its fundamentally protean nature.
As a weapon of civil society, PIL _prima facie_ appears to be a mere legal tool and,
therefore, a classic example of associational activity. But it is really a mirror image
of the populist contemporary politics it assails without any of the protections that
populist political mobilization regularly requires in a liberal democracy like India.
Just as the practices of illegality rampant among India's white-collared denizens
make its civil society uncontainable within any conventional notions of civic
behaviour, its favourite weapon, PIL, too, has only a thin veneer of legality. The
judicial populism of PIL allows for a radical instability that continually pushes the
limits of what a court can do.


[^4/1]: Interview, March 2009.

[^4/2]: I will use the term 'slum' here, as it is colloquially understood and used even by
courts, to refer to a type of settlement locally known as '_Jhuggi_ Jhopdi clusters'
or more often, 'JJ Clusters'. Interestingly, the term 'slum' is not popularly deployed
in Delhi for a settlement that has the legal status of a slum area under the 'Slum
Areas' (Improvement and Clearance) Act 1956. The latter legally notified 'slum
areas' are on privately owned land and enjoy certain statutory rights. On the other
hand, JJ clusters are on 'public land', i.e. land owned by government agencies. For
the vicissitudes of the term slum in legal and illegal discourses, see Ramanathan (2005). Throughout this chapter, I will use the term 'slum' to refer to 'JJ clusters'. The
term 'slum', of course, comes with a train of over-determined meanings and presupposes
distance. But precisely such meanings and distance influenced the way the
protagonists of this paper, the appellate judges of Delhi, viewed these settlements.
I would prefer to use the term 'slum' in quotation marks throughout this paper,
but since this would be too clumsy, I urge the reader to assume quotation marks
whenever this term is used here.

land'. He had also directed that where resettlement was done, the resettled should
not be given the land on a lease-hold basis, as was the practice, but on licence --- 'with
no right in the licensee to transfer or part with possession of the land in question' ---

carries this as eligibility condition no. (xi): 'The allotment of flat will be subject to
the result of pending decision and outcome of the SLP (Civil No. 3166--3167/2003)

bureaucrats, industrialists and media persons were leaked to the press. The Radia
tapes became one of the biggest political scandal in contemporary India. One of the
lesser-known conversations leaked in these tapes is between Radia and a prominent
bureaucrat
named Sunil Arora in which he informs Radia that a Delhi High Court
judge, Justice Vijender Jain, was paid off 90 million rupees at
his residence in a sealing
case related to real estate by a middleman. The favourable judgment, (Arora goes on),
was written one month before it was delivered in court; the middleman was even
given an advance copy. Arora also referred to Jain as Justice Y.K. Sabharwal's man ---
'_Sabharwal ka khaas aadmi_'. None of these allegations have yet been acted upon legally.
Justice Jain was appointed chairman of the Human Rights Commission of the North
Indian state of Haryana in October 2012. This was the man who led the campaign
