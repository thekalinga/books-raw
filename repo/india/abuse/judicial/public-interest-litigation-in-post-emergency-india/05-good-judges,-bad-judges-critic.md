The Supreme Court, in a 2010 judgment, provided its own history of PIL,
broadly dividing public interest litigation in India into three phases.

>Phase-I: It deals with cases of this Court where directions and orders
>were passed primarily to protect fundamental rights under Article 21
>of the marginalized groups and sections of the society who because of
>extreme poverty, illiteracy and ignorance cannot approach this court or
>the High Courts.
>
>Phase-II: It deals with the cases relating to protection, preservation of
>ecology, environment, forests, marine life, wildlife, mountains, rivers,
>historical monuments, etc.
>
>Phase-III: It deals with the directions issued by the Courts in maintaining
>the probity, transparency and integrity in governance.[^5/2]

From 'poverty' to 'environment' to 'governance': this is the trajectory of PIL
that the Indian Supreme Court itself confesses to. Sudipta Kaviraj has written as
to how the decline of institutional spaces with Mrs Gandhi's more personalized
politics made possible a new irresponsibility of ideology with baffling shifts
of emphasis, the most spectacular of these being that 'fertility and not poverty
became the major obstacle to Indian development' during the Emergency.[^5/3] PIL,
too, with its lack of institutional grounding and close identification with specific
judges, has been prone to these sorts of wild fluctuations in ideology. The most
celebrated of these has been the change of focus from poverty in its first phase
in the early 1980s to '_bourgeois_ environmentalism' from the mid-1990s. It is the
inherent instability of populism in both instances that allowed such a fundamental
shift in priorities to take place.

This change in priorities in PIL cases has not gone unlamented. There has
been a significant literature criticizing it, especially the dislodging of the poor
from the position of PIL's foremost discursive constituency. From the early 2000s,
partly as a result of the kind of court actions in PILs that we saw in the previous
two chapters, there has been strong criticism of the court's approach to PIL. Two
principal strands can be discerned in this debate --- one led by the left-liberal and
activist constituency that is disappointed by what they perceive as the decline
and fall of 1980s-era PIL, and the other led by critical self-reflection from the
Bench itself. This second strand is represented by a few incumbent judges, the
most vociferous being Justice Markandey Katju in the Supreme Court.

## The consequentialist critique of PIL

The argument of the first strand is best summed up by Upendra Baxi, who
pithily characterizes post-liberalization PIL as the 'Structural Adjustment of
Judicial Activism'.[^5/4] He calls the new version of PIL 'judicial counter-revolution
proceeding via the structural adjustment of judicial role, function, and power.'[^5/5]
Prashant Bhushan, possibly India's most well-known PIL lawyer, argues that the
shifts in political economy since the 1990s led to changes in the nature of PIL:

>The court has in fact bought the ideology underlying the economic reforms ---
an ideology which venerates the virtues of the free market and undermines
the role of the state in providing education, jobs, and the basic amenities of
life to its citizens.[^5/6]

A more subtle version of the same argument is made by the legal scholar
Usha Ramanathan when she points out that by the end of the 1990s, 'the original
constituency of PIL --- the poor and the vulnerable to whom constitutional and
legal rights had to be reached' did not 'have the court on their side'.[^5/7] In this
vein, there has been some recent work by economist Varun Gauri providing a
quantitative analysis of PIL beneficiaries. Gauri writes:

>Win rates for fundamental rights claims are now significantly higher when
the claimant is from an advantaged social group than when he or she is from
a marginalized group. That constitutes a social reversal both from the original
objective of public interest litigation and from the relative win rates in the
1980s.[^5/8]

In its basic terms, this argument is nostalgic about the founding PIL era
of the late 1970s and 1980s, which was spearheaded by 'progressive' judges ---
Justices Krishna Iyer, P. S. Bhagwati, Chinnappa Reddy and D. A. Desai (Baxi
likes to call them 'the four musketeers').[^5/9] But now, in post-liberalization times,
the argument goes, 'regressive' judges like Justices Kirpal, Sabharwal and Jain have
led PIL in the opposite direction. Aditya Nigam, too, has drawn a similarly sharp
distinction between what he calls 'PIL Mark 1' (1980s PIL) and 'PIL Mark 2'
(post-liberalization PIL, which he labels 'The Brass Band of Neo-Liberalism').[^5/10]
This strand of argument tends to completely overlook the remarkable continuity
between these two phases of PIL in terms of the processual instability at its heart.
It insistently focuses on the discontinuities in PIL's career dwelling on the stark
changes in its priorities in terms of political economy, while never really addressing
the fundamental question: why is the PIL court so effective as the agent of 'neo-liberalism'
in India?

This ideological approach to thinking about PIL is best summed up, as
legal scholar Rajeev Dhavan had done in another context, as 'consequentialist'
--- 'the consequences of judicial decisions speak for themselves ... From such a
consequentialist analysis flows the further charge that the judiciary is essentially
class-based.'[^5/11] These accounts typically read the history of the Indian judiciary
in 'progressive/regressive' terms. Such a perspective had a field day in the pre-Emergency
era, when the Supreme Court was portrayed as having stood by the
right to property and, therefore, deemed to be regressive and anti-land reform.
It was this discourse that was so successfully mobilized by Indira Gandhi and
Mohan Kumaramangalam in the early 1970s in their call for 'committed' judges
who were ideologically suitable. It was also the basis of the supersession of judges,
as we saw in the first chapter. The enduring legacy of Kumaramangalam is that
the dominant critique of PIL today continues to mimic the terms of his discourse.

Not surprisingly, the most clearly articulated version of such a consequentialist
approach to 'judicial activism' comes from Justice P. N. Bhagwati, the architect
of PIL in India, in an article in 1985 where he reflected on this issue at some
length.[^5/12] It is important to rehearse Bhagwati's argument in some detail, because
it has since become _the_ hegemonic position on judicial politics in India. His point
of departure in this article is that 'judges do make law' and that 'judicial activism
is a necessary and inevitable part of the judicial process.'[^5/13] The question would be
'what kind of judicial activism, how much of it' and 'to what willed results'. Based
on these criteria, Bhagwati argues that judicial activism can take three forms. The
first of these he calls 'technical activism', which declares judicial freedom to deploy
various techniques and choices. It 'is merely concerned with keeping juristic
techniques open-ended.'[^5/14] The second is what Bhagwati refers to as 'juristic
activism'. It 'is concerned ... with the creation of new concepts irrespective of the
purposes which they serve.'[^5/15] It is not concerned with the social consequences
of these concepts. Whether they 'help to preserve the _status quo_' or to 'impede
equitable distribution' is irrelevant.

Bhagwati found both of these forms of judicial activism limited. What he
was concerned about was the 'purpose for which such activism is practiced'. He
was interested, he wrote, in 'the _instrumental_ use of judicial activism'.[^5/16] Legal
scholars Craig and Deshpande have called his style an example of teleological
reasoning.[^5/17] For Bhagwati, judicial activism could 'be evaluated only in terms of
its social objective'. He was, therefore, a votary of a third kind, which he called
'social activism' --- juristic activism for achieving social justice. In a clear enunciation
of the 'committed judiciary' principle, he explained what it meant. Judges in
India, he wrote, 'have to justify their decision-making within the framework of
constitutional values' aimed at the 'substantiviation of social justice'.[^5/18] In this,
they were 'motivated' by the 'Directive Principles of State Policy' of the Indian
Constitution, which held out 'social justice as the central feature of the new
constitutional order'. These principles 'inspired some of the justices to become
social activists'. 'Judge led' and 'judge induced', PIL was the means they chose
to achieve this. PIL has since been closely identified with 'social activist' judges.
All the procedural limitations of common law adjudication --- standing, adversarial
procedure, fact-finding and judicial remedies were departed from in the precedent-setting
landmark PIL cases of the early 1980s. And academic analyses as well as
political rhetoric, I would argue, have since been skewed by an unquestioning
adherence to this narrow consequentialist approach.

Bhagwati's theory of PIL, so pithily formulated in his article, has been hugely
influential. It successfully set out the discursive boundaries within which PIL
has since been evaluated: 'only in terms of its social objective'.[^5/19] The terms set by
it, inviting us to this era of PIL-led 'social activism' have largely been accepted:
concentrate on evaluating the just-ness of outcomes, while condoning any level of
improvization of judicial process. It is a formulation that has led most literature on
PIL to concentrate on the outcomes alone. If the results were largely for the good,
the questionable nature of PIL procedure was to be glossed over. The problem
with PIL only arose for such analysis when the results were no longer to the liking
of its erstwhile advocates. Because the judicial outcomes no longer seem to favour
the classes one is sympathetic to, PIL suddenly becomes questionable. There is a
certain 'God that failed' quality to such criticism of PIL.

In a recent book espousing many such views, the term 'conservative' is
repeatedly used critically to describe the post-liberalization phase of PIL.[^5/20] The
fundamental problem with such a characterization is that there was nothing
remotely conservative about the radical processual innovations introduced by PIL
cases in this period. PIL was primarily a revolution in the procedure begun by
Bhagwati in pre-liberalization India and taken to its logical culmination by judges
like Vijender Jain in the changed circumstances of the twenty-first century. The
latter were simply instrumentalizing the immense radical potential of PIL and
the _carte blanche_ it offered to appellate judges to pursue political causes they
deemed fit. Once a frankly instrumental role is accepted for PIL courts, with its
decisions moored only by concepts as capacious as 'social justice', whose meanings
necessarily vary with the zeitgeist, it should be no surprise that the issues taken up
by a new generation of PIL judges for their social activism are of a very different
sort from the original votaries of PIL.

In the previous chapters, while I have drawn attention to the disastrous
outcomes of certain PIL cases, my emphasis has been on how such outcomes
result from the inherent unfairness of PIL procedure. The objection, however, may
be that one can easily conceive 'good' outcomes also resulting from a process of
adjudication which is similarly unjust: consider the typical _suo motu_ PIL, where a
court takes up a policy issue appoints its favourite lawyer as _amicus curiae_, suggests
solutions based on half-baked evidence collected by its own random appointees,
issues legislative guidelines binding as law and, then, appoints personnel to
monitor the implementation of these policies. This rather familiar PIL process,
so unremarkable as to seem like the contemporary norm, can certainly result
in 'good' outcomes, and it sometimes does. So enduring is Bhagwati's criterion
for PIL's evaluation, that any criticism of PIL _per se_ is constantly confronted
by the question: what about these good PILs, which have successfully offered
such grand solutions to the country's problems? The analysts of PIL then reach
for their Benthamite hedonistic calculus, measuring the pain of the people who
have suffered from PIL against the pleasure of those who have gained from it.
And after careful calculations, they declare that the despotism of PIL judges
is still acceptable because it is, on balance, benevolent. My aim here is to move
the debate on PIL away from an analysis based on such a facile calculus. The
problem with PIL is not just that it increasingly leads to unjust outcomes because
of the changed ideological climate, but that it can so easily do so because of its
diminution of judicial process. My attempt in this section is to formulate an anti--_anti PIL_ critique, aimed at moving this critique away from outcomes to process.

The implications of the hegemony enjoyed by Bhagwati's narrowly
consequentialist framework of evaluating India's judicial process were even wider.
One of the key attributes of the modern judicial process is that it results in a
written order or judgment that has to be logically consistent. This impinges on
the very definition of juristic activity in the words of Max Weber: 'the jurist,
assuming the empirical validity of the legal propositions, examines each of them
and tries to determine its logically correct meaning in such a way that all of them
can be combined in a system which is logically coherent, i.e., free from internal
contradictions.'[^5/21] But as per Bhagwati, juristic activism was of secondary import
compared to social activism, so the analysis of a judgment was to be conducted
primarily in terms of its social impact, not so much the structure and soundness of
legal arguments within it. Now that judges were supposed to think of themselves
as social activists and not _mere_ jurists, a certain looseness of legal language entered
Indian appellate judgments, with Bhagwati himself leading the way.

The result was nothing less than a self-conscious departure from the very
fundamental principles of modern law, characterized by 'logically formal
rationality', according to Weber. By rationality here, he meant 'following some
criteria of decision which is applicable to all like cases', and by formality, 'employing
criteria of decision intrinsic to the legal system'.[^5/22] While there is no conscious
departure from rationality, what Bhagwati's consequentialist model does is move
the Indian judicial process from principles of formally rational law to its opposite
--- substantively rational law. As Trubek's helpful guide through Weber's corpus on
law informs us, substantive rationality:

> ... is in some sense governed by rules --- that is why, it is 'rational' --- but these are
the principles of some body of thought _outside_ the law itself, such as religion,
ethical philosophy, or ideology. This type of law will be constantly tempted
to reach specific results, dictated by the value premises of this external set of
principles, which are neither general nor predictable.[^5/23]

As Weber described the form of substantive legal rationality, 'the aim is rather
to find a type of law which is most appropriate to the expediential and ethical
goals of the authorities in question.'[^5/24] This is precisely what Bhagwati's PIL model
had transformed judicial process to --- pure ideology.

As Bhagwati's model became increasingly hegemonic, commitment to
principles of law in Indian judicial discourse mattered less and less, what mattered
was commitment to an ideology. Careful judicial prose no longer had any premium
attached to it. What replaced it were shoddily written judgments making the right
political noises, generally holding forth on social problems, attempting to imitate
the bizarre bombast of judges like Bhagwati, though hardly anybody could possibly
match him in pomposity. The discourse had shifted to such an extent that when
H. M. Seervai criticized Bhagwati's judgment in _EP Royappa vs. State of Tamil
Nadu_[^5/25] for making the elementary logical error of the fallacy of the undistributed
middle, this did not have the serious repercussions it should have had.[^5/26] To this day,
_Royappa_ is binding precedent and its _dictum_ has been hugely influential, having
added the 'arbitrariness' ground to the standard 'reasonable classification' test in
order to examine violations of the Right to Equality. The fact that this _dictum_ is
also manifestly illogical makes no difference in the new scheme of things.

To take a more recent and equally egregious example, legal scholar Lavanya
Rajamani has critically examined the Indian Supreme Court's famed 'environmental
jurisprudence'.[^5/27] She takes issue with the court's importation of the 'precautionary
principle' into domestic law by blithely declaring it to be a part of customary
international law in a much-cited case,[^5/28] when it is actually a highly contested
concept. She found the court's reasoning 'riddled with logical leaps', its analysis
'intellectually sloppy' and its general mode that of 'transforming rhetoric into right'.
Her broad conclusion is that public interest environmental jurisdiction is being
extended in 'anarchic fashion.'[^5/29] These gross instances of juristic incompetence
by India's celebrated Supreme Court can be multiplied in many areas of law, but
in the post-Emergency intellectual climate around law framed by what we might
call Bhagwati's talisman, which infected legal academia too, criticism on such
grounds is rarely voiced. Competitive radicalism had become the new currency in
the academic sphere as well. Any criticism that demanded intellectual rigour from
the judges would now be characterized as excessively legalistic and elitist.[^5/30] All
that mattered was fidelity to the ideological currents of the time. Old-fashioned
concerns like the fairness of judicial process adopted or the logical application of
legal principles in judgments were now of secondary importance.

The post-liberalization ideological critics of PIL, having earlier bought into
its attenuated judicial process, naturally found themselves focusing their blinkered
lens on the disastrous consequences alone of post-liberalization PIL, notably its
grotesque class bias. This has also meant that they adopted a purely discursive
strategy, with no serious critical focus on the materiality of PIL processes, which
is where the problem lay all along. There is a chronic failure to recognize that
PIL provides a whole new mechanism to concentrate policy-making power in
the hands of judges and enables them to forge powerful tools to operationalize
these new policies. Judges can raise an issue of public importance by themselves,
suggest solutions, appoint people to collect evidence and even appoint personnel
to monitor the implementation of these policies. Purely as an analogy, let us say
for the sake of argument that a pro-management judiciary may have changed the
very nature of labour jurisprudence in the last 15 years. But even if there were to
be a stark trend in labour law that denudes labour of the legal protections it earlier
enjoyed, such a trend would still not be comparable to what PIL has done in the
same period. A pure conceptual development in the law can only go so far. It does
not provide the apparatus to change the very nature of governance, to enforce their
ideas via takeover of the whole arena. PIL has made this possible in the areas in
which it has intervened. It provides the procedural infrastructure to create a field
for its operation and transform it.

One of the few critics to foreground the extent of PIL's procedural departure
is Usha Ramanathan, though for her, too, the problem primarily lies not in the
extraordinary powers of the PIL court _per se_ but in the change in ideological
climate after liberalization. She criticizes a leading commentator on Indian
judicial activism, S.P. Sathe, for looking at PIL 'as merely an aspect of judicial
review'.[^5/31] The newness of PIL, Ramanathan argues, is 'because of the extraordinary
techniques of judicial intervention that the Supreme Court invented and adopted.
It is also the casting aside by the court of restraints placed by the doctrine of
'separation of powers' that called for a degree of ingenuity, which marked this
phase of judicial activism. The departure from processual precision to substantive
justice was accompanied by "juristic" activism.'[^5/32] Indeed, PIL had gone far beyond
judicial review, and to use the old tools to examine its 'achievements' would be
severely limiting. More recently, Ramanathan has succinctly shown how the rise of
the institution of the _amicus curiae_ since the mid-1990s has meant 'the return to
exclusive conversations between lawyers and the Bench with the additional dash
of the power that the idea of ''public interest'' has brought with it.'[^5/33]

## The institutional critique of PIL

There has been a recent trend of legal scholars who diagnose the problem with
PIL not just in its ideological transformation but in its judicial process as well.
There is a realization that it is the process of PIL itself, which causes the outcomes
that the ideological critics are singularly obsessed with, that needs to be at least
partially reformed. In this vein, Krishnaswamy and Khosla have argued for the
need to pay further attention to the judicial process in PIL, which this book tries to
engage with seriously. There also seems to be a recognition that some clarity with
regard to institutional norms regulating PIL procedure is necessary. This strand
of criticism often relies on influential analyses of such litigation in other common
law countries which would apparently bear comparison to PIL in India. While
it is certainly a most useful exercise to contextualize and evaluate Indian PIL in
a comparative manner, the difficulty is that such comparison ends up missing
out on just how extreme the Indian experience of PIL really has been. Indeed,
Krishnaswamy and Khosla take exception to India's PIL being seen as 'unique in
the common law world'.[^5/34] Similarly, Thiruvengadam has suggested that Abram
Chayes' influential theorization of 'Public Law Litigation' should be the reference
point to think of the expanded role of a judge in PIL, as Clark Cunningham had
also argued earlier.[^5/35] However, Indian PIL has gone much further than even
Chayes' heterodox model. Thiruvengadam himself argued that the dilution of
_locus standi_ already makes Indian PIL different from Chayes' model. In fact, for
all the procedural departures that Chayes theorized, he could not have envisaged
litigation without the very existence of the petitioner or the complete absence of
any affected parties. Indian PIL allows for a process which is _sou motu_, or entirely
judge initiated, as well as enables the court petitioner herself to be removed and
replaced with an _amicus curiae_ appointed by it, as we have seen repeatedly in
previous chapters. We have also seen how Indian PIL allows the judge to rely on
rather low standards of evidence, which as Krishnaswamy has elsewhere argued,
goes completely against Chayes's suggestion of a higher burden of proof in such
cases.[^5/36] And Indian PIL cases can culminate in clearly legislative remedies as well
as decisions instructing the Executive to undertake specific construction projects
costing enormous amounts of money. These are way beyond the imagination of any
judicial process almost anywhere outside South Asia. Another astute recent critic of
PIL has been Lavanya Rajamani, who has relied on Lon Fuller's famous argument
that a judicial forum is ill-equipped to handle 'polycentric disputes', i.e. disputes
that 'involve many affected parties and a somewhat fluid state of affairs.'[^5/37] She
argues that intervention in such situations result in complex repercussions 'as not
all affected parties are readily identifiable and therefore before the Court'.[^5/38] This
is undoubtedly an important point to ponder over in such litigation. However, in
Indian PIL cases, the situation is much more extreme. Even the 'necessary parties'
who are directly affected by a PIL case are either not even made a party as we
repeatedly saw in the slum demolition PILs in Chapter 3, or are not heard even if
they are allowed to intervene as we saw in the PIL relating to industrial closure in
Chapter 2. However, this strand of criticism with its insightful procedural criticism
of PIL offers a way forward if the pathologies of PIL are to be mitigated. Rajamani
suggests that the court 'evolve a set of guidelines for restrained and responsible
PIL', Thiruvengadam's suggestion is that the PIL judge should 'be encouraged to
adopt a far more modest, facilitative role',[^5/39] while Khosla and Krishnaswamy argue
for the need to clarify the question of _locus standi_ in PIL cases.

The other institutional critique of PIL has come from within the Supreme
Court itself. The close identification of PIL with Justice Bhagwati in the early
1980s meant that the famous 'epistolary jurisdiction', by which letters written
to the court would be treated as petitions, often had letters being personally
addressed to Justice Bhagwati. He would then ensure that the PIL was heard by
him. As Upendra Baxi wrote in the early 1980s, this imprinted the early PILs
'with the insignia of an individual justice, whereas what is needed in days to come
is a collective imprimatur of the Court for the new litigation.'[^5/40] An institutional
response was attempted by the Bench of two judges (S. M. Fazal Ali and
Venkataramiah J. J.) in the _Sudipt Mazumdar_ case in 1983, when it formulated 10
questions regarding PIL and passed an order referring to a Constitutional Bench
(of a minimum of five judges).[^5/41] These questions included, among others:

>1. Should this Court take notice of such letters addressed by individuals
> by post enclosing some paper cuttings and take action on them _suo
> motu_ except where the complaint refers to deprivation of liberty of any
> individual?
>
>6. Can this Court take action on letters addressed to it where the facts
> disclosed are not sufficient to take action? Should these letters be
> treated differently from other regular petitions filed into this Court in
> this regard and should the District Magistrate or the District Judge be
> asked to enquire and make a report to this Court to ascertain whether
> there is any case for further action?
>
>10. Would such informality not lead to greater identification of the Court
> with the cause than it would be when a case involving the same type of
> cause is filed in the normal way?

After having kept this case pending for a long time, a Constitution Bench
around 2000 decided that there was no need to order any such guidelines. Three
decades after the 1983 order, these questions have still not been taken up and
decided by any Bench of the Supreme Court. The ad hoc approach continues,
and no attempt at tidying up PIL principles was ever successfully made. There
have been a few judicial initiatives since then to lay down such principles, but all
have met the fate of _Sudipt Mazumdar_.[^5/42] It is still worthwhile, in my opinion, to
examine these attempts and the institutional inertia they were met with.

In a concurring judgment to Justice Bhagwati's in the _Bandhua Mukti Morcha_
case of 1984, Justice Pathak tried to formulate an institutional response so that
PIL could 'command broad acceptance'. He clarified that:

>All communications and petitions invoking the jurisdiction of the Court
must be addressed to the entire Court, that is to say, the Chief Justice and
his companion Judges. No such communication of petition can properly be
addressed to a particular Judge ... Communications and petitions addressed
to a particular Judge are improper and violate the institutional personality of
the Court.

Feeling the need to place limits on the flexibility of procedure that can be
adopted in a PIL, J. Pathak laid down certain basic norms:

>Whatever the procedure adopted by the court it must be procedure known to
judicial tenets and characteristic of a judicial proceeding ... The Court must
ever remind itself that one of the indicia identifying it as a Court is the nature
and character of the procedure adopted by it in determining a controversy.
It is in that sense limited in the evolution of procedures pursued by it in the
process of an adjudication and in the grant and execution of the relief.

His has been a lone voice in the wilderness.

In 1988, the Supreme Court did introduce a new streamlined procedure to
deal with letter petitions: any letter petition received would first be screened by a
new PIL cell and would then be placed before a judge nominated for this purpose
by the Chief Justice. This was meant to make sure that letters, even if addressed to
specific judges, would henceforth deal with in an institutional manner. But though
their symbolic charge remains undiminished, letter petitions have come to form
a negligible percentage of the PILs actually dealt with by the Supreme Court.[^5/43]

In one of the few academic writings to have expressed the need for an
institutional approach to PIL, S. K. Agrawala proposed in 1985 that

>The Court is not equipped in terms of the infrastructure to apply the non-adversarial
procedure. If adversarial procedure is not to be applicable in PIL
matters, the parties must know as to what the components of the alternative
procedure(s) are. The laying down of guidelines for the non-adversarial
procedure is, therefore, equally important.[^5/44]

Particularly important are his suggestions regarding the approach to questions
of fact in PIL cases:

>If the court has to manage the collection of facts, data and evidence on its own,
it seems to be obviously desirable that a permanent, trained and experienced
fact-finding machinery is set up under the control and supervision of the
Supreme Court.[^5/45]

In a prescient suggestion that anticipated Justice Vijender Jain's court
commissioners in _Kalyan Sanstha_, Agrawala pointed out the problems that would
emerge with Justice Bhagwati's blithe disregard for procedure:

>A judge who appoints commissioners would be inclined to appoint those,
whom or about whom he knows personally. It is human nature. Such
commissioners are likely to be at least as biased as the judges who have been
enthusiastic about PIL litigation. Bias even for a good cause, is bias all the
same. Secondly, they may not be adequately trained for the job that may
be entrusted to them ... Fact finding, investigation and reporting are not
something that everybody and anybody can be entrusted with.[^5/46]

In August 2009, when I interviewed a court commissioner appointed in
_Kalyan Sanstha_, he drew a direct connection between his appointment in this
case and the 1985 precedent laid down by Justice Bhagwati in _Bandhua Mukti
Morcha_, that rules of civil procedure, which are normally made applicable in a
modified form to all Supreme Court cases through the Supreme Court Rules[^5/47]
need not apply to PIL cases. Therefore, cross-examination of evidence collected by
commissioners would not be necessary. This would lead to fundamental departures
from certain principles of adjudication, as Muralidhar and Desai argued in 2000:

>The reports given by court-appointed commissioners raise problems
regarding their evidentiary value. No court can found its decision on facts
unless they are proved according to law. This implies the right of an adversary
to test them by cross-examination or at least counter affidavits.[^5/48]

Justice Pathak in _Bandhua Mukti Morcha_ had tried to introduce this minimum
idea of natural justice so that when evidence was collected by court-appointed
commissioners in a PIL, at least a chance to hear the other side and contradict
it be given to the affected party. But Justice Bhagwati did not want to encumber
PIL with any such procedural safeguards. His radical ideas had now come home
to roost.

During the proceedings of one of the applications filed in _Kalyan Sanstha_, I
watched as the lawyer for a slum ordered to be demolished by the court, tried to
make the factual point that these were _kaccha_ houses which would be saved by the
Delhi Special Provisions Act, as discussed in the previous chapter. Chief Justice MK
Sharma sniggered at him, 'But this is a _question of fact_. We can't go into a factual
question in _writ jurisdiction_.' In general, all the alleged facts (on the basis of which
the commissioners were pushing the demolition apparatus into action) were deemed
incontestable, thanks to the supposedly non-adversarial nature of PIL. The comment,
'this is not an adversarial proceeding' would be used repeatedly by the Bench to
effectively deflect any inconvenient _questions of fact_. This was the exact phrase that
Justice Bhagwati had used more than a dozen times in the _Morcha_ judgment, that
most celebrated of PIL cases.

After the 1980s, hardly any attempts were made to create clear procedural rules
for PIL. In 1997, Chief Justice Verma, who had initiated the process that would
culminate in the apotheosis of the _amicus curiae_ in _Vineet Narain_, announced the
setting up of a committee under a Supreme Court judge to draft a separate chapter
on Public Interest Litigation to be introduced in the Supreme Court Rules, 'which
would contain general rules for guidance to maintain uniformity'.[^5/49] But Chief
Justice Verma soon retired and nothing came of it.

In 2007, soon after the retirement of Chief Justice Sabharwal, just as the
processes I have described in the previous chapters were reaching their peak,
there was a severe attack on PIL from the Supreme Court Bench itself --- by a
maverick judge called Markandey Katju. Katju used to great effect a strategy
commonly deployed by the Indian Supreme Court judges: to repeatedly cite one's
own previous judgments as precedent. Katju passed at least four such judgments
between 2007 and 2009. The first, given in May 2007, and the last, given in 2009,
are particularly interesting because they were both delivered as part of a two-judge
Bench, and the other respective incumbent judges gave their own answers to the
questions Katju posed of PIL. But the most effectively destabilizing was the one
time (in December 2007) when Katju found the other judge, A. K. Mathur, on
the Bench, agreeing with him, because it immediately carried the force of law as
binding precedent.[^5/50]

Justice Katju's 2007 judgment in this singular instance, _Aravali Golf Club_
tapped into the theory of separation of powers. He argued:

>In the name of judicial activism Judges cannot cross their limits and try to
take over functions which belong to another organ of the State ... Judges must
know their limits and must not try to run the Government. They must have
modesty and humility, and not behave like Emperors.

Katju quoted a lecture by Justice Verma to ridicule many PILs the Delhi
High Court was in the news for:

>Judiciary has intervened to question a mysterious car racing down the
Tughlaq Road in Delhi, allotment of a particular bungalow to a Judge,
specific bungalows for the Judges' pool, monkeys capering in colonies, stray
cattle on the streets, clearing public conveniences, levying congestion charges
at peak hours at airports with heavy traffic, etc. under the threat of use of
contempt power to enforce compliance of its orders.

Katju added to this list:

>The orders passed by the High Court of Delhi in recent times dealt
with subjects ranging from age and other criteria for nursery admissions,
unauthorized schools, criteria for free seats in schools, supply of drinking
water in schools, number of free beds in hospitals on public land, use and
misuse of ambulances, requirements for establishing a world class burns ward
in the hospital, the kind of air Delhites breathe, begging in public, the use
of sub-ways, the nature of buses we board, the legality of constructions in
Delhi, identifying the buildings to be demolished, the size of speed-breakers
on Delhi roads, auto-rickshaw over-charging, growing frequency of road
accidents and enhancing of road fines etc. In our opinion these were matters
pertaining exclusively to the executive or legislative domain.

None of this was incorrect, of course, but to point out from the Bench that
these matters were not fit subjects for judicial intervention was by now immensely
counter-intuitive, and Katju's intemperate style made it seem especially unpalatable.

Katju's opinions created enormous controversy in the media as well in legal
and academic circles. The response was mostly acerbic. Rajeev Dhavan accused
him of 'judicial terrorism'.[^5/51] Interestingly, this was the same term that Upendra
Baxi had used way back in 1982 to attack Justice Tulzapurkar's early attack on
PIL, where he had mentioned his opposition to the forum-shopping that Justice
Bhagwati's monopoly of PIL made possible.[^5/52] Tulzapurkar had then said that the
court should not 'in the name of alleviating the grave public injury ... arrogate to
itself the role of an administrator or an overseer looking after the management
and day to day working of all non-functioning or malfunctioning public bodies or
institutions.'[^5/53]

Dhavan went on to oppose any attempt to reopen the questions posed
in _Sudipt Mazumdar_, declaring that '\[a\]n assessment of PIL itself will open a
Pandora's box, which is neither necessary nor desirable'. T. R. Andhyarujina, one
of the few _senior advocates_ of the Supreme Court somewhat critical of PIL,
suggested in a newspaper editorial that:

>A larger bench of the Supreme Court should lay down authoritative criteria
of the permissible and impermissible judicial interventions ... To distil judicial
power by rigid rules of conduct is not advisable but it may at least guide the
future course of the action of courts in the vast and amorphous jurisdiction
assumed by them in the name of judicial activism.[^5/54]

The Chief Justice of India, K. G. Balakrishnan, immediately went into
damage control mode in his judicial as well as extra-judicial capacities. He 'quelled
dissenting voices by declaring that public interest litigation cases (PILs) will
continue despite the order.'[^5/55] He also immediately separated the two judges so
that Katju would no longer find a willing partner for his heretical judgments. But
the big question had again arisen before the Chief Justice: should a Constitutional
Bench be set up to decide the principles of PIL that Katju was questioning?
Again, the answer was no. A three-judge Bench was set up, but soon even that
went into cold storage. It met the same fate as _Sudipt Mazumdar_. The reason for
this steadfast refusal to systematize the PIL jurisdiction is perhaps best explained
by Pratap Bhanu Mehta, 'The legitimacy and power that India's judiciary does
enjoy most likely flow not from a clear and consistent constitutional vision, but
rather from its opposite.'[^5/56]

The reasoning of the two judges mentioned earlier, who disagreed with Katju
while being on the same Bench as him --- Justice S. B. Sinha in _State of UP vs. Jeet
S Bisht_, and Justice A. K. Ganguly in _University of Kerala vs. Council, Principals,
Colleges, Kerala & Others_ --- is important to rehearse here, because the tropes it
deploys are consistently used to repel any criticism of PIL. Both judgments reject
the idea that there is any strict 'separation of powers' in the Indian Constitution.
Another strategy common to both judgments is that a key weapon they use to
deflect Katju's attack on PIL is the international recognition it has received. This
is not uncommon: Indian Supreme Court judges like to pat themselves on the
back, routinely citing articles by foreign academics hailing the ingenuity of PIL.
Justice Sinha began his discussion with the statement: 'Indian Supreme Court
has achieved world-wide acclaim in fashioning new rights under Part III of the
Constitution and also using Directive Principles as interpretive devices for giving a
contemporaneous meaning to Part III.' He went on to quote an Oxford professor,
Sandra Fredman's article in a British public law journal, which saw 'inspiration in
the wide-ranging work of Indian Supreme Court for European Court of Justice'.[^5/57]

Justice Ganguly, too, relied on two British luminaries, one writing expressly
on PIL. Ganguly justified the judicial legislations made by the Supreme Court
in PIL cases by noting 'that this attempted legislation by this Court has been
applauded internationally'. He referred to a Cambridge Law Journal article[^5/58]
which celebrated India's departure from the idea of separation of powers:

>It is possible for a court deliberately to depart from the triadic structure in
order to combat the resource deficiencies of litigants. An interesting example
of this can be found in India where the Supreme Court has attempted to meet
the institutional challenges posed by a combination of a weak legislation and
a poor citizenry. The Supreme Court has relaxed the formal restrictions on
applications to the court. An application can be made by a letter, or even a
postcard, addressed to the court ... These measures must be commended as
a significant attempt to adapt the court to the needs of the unempowered
citizenship. ... [^5/59]

Another strategy that both the judges used was to subtly point out how all the
lawyers concerned in these two specific cases, indeed most members of the bar, were
in favour of PIL. This is seemingly correct and remarkable because it was certainly
not true in the early 1980s. As Upendra Baxi noted then, the bar's reaction swung
'from indifference to indignation at what it regards as freak litigation.'[^5/60] While
the initial response to PIL from the bar, or at least its elite members, was one of
hostility, two decades down, almost all the leading members of the Supreme Court
Bar are leading exponents of PIL. This would be evident if one looks at the official
online bios of the judges of the Delhi High Court and Supreme Court, most of
whom are appellate lawyers who have been elevated to the Bench. Almost all
prominently display their PIL cases as badges of honour. Pride of place is given to
the cases they handled as _amicus curiae_. With the enormous symbolic capital that
it commands, PIL has emerged as a currency for upward mobility in legal circles.

Perhaps the most disingenuous trope repeatedly used to defend PIL from these
attacks was that of 'misuse'. Katju's attack on PIL was seen as throwing out the
baby with the bathwater. Even the ideological critics of post-liberalization PIL were
critical of this. After all, the argument went, it was not PIL _per se_ that was the
problem, it was the 'misuse of PIL'. This trope is a persistent one in Indian legal
debates generally. It is not the law which is the problem, it is its misuse. Indian
security statutes might give the police blanket powers to arrest and detain suspects
indefinitely without bail, and confessions made to police officers be made admissible
as evidence. But if such powers lead to endemic practices of torture, it is called 'misuse'.
The PIL jurisdiction gave blanket powers to judges to act as per their ideological
beliefs in order to help the poor and promote distributive justice. But this was not
seen as a problem. Institutional checks were not needed, went the argument, what
were needed were good judges. The right kind of PIL was still possible if we had the
right kind of judges. So, different PIL commentators and _dramatis personae_ were
hopeful of their respective personifications of good judges. Upendra Baxi would be
nostalgic about his 'four musketeers' from the 1980s. A successful PIL litigant from
1990s Shiv Sagar Tiwari would long for the days of Justice Kuldip Singh whom
he described as a '_dabangg_ judge' --- an uber masculine, fearless judge --- while the
rest were feckless 'eunuchs' according to him. And a _Kalyan Sanstha_ commissioner
would wistfully talk of the days of Justice Vijender Jain as the golden period of PIL.
None of these PIL-_wallahs_ had any problems with the kind of enormous powers
PIL bestowed on judges. The idea of good judges' and 'bad judges' was part and
parcel of the PIL game that they all wanted to play. As Colin Gonsalves, a leading
PIL lawyer, told me in an interview in May 2009: '\[The PIL\] court has capacity to
do good and do bad. I would rather the court has this capacity than not.' PIL was a
Faustian bargain that its votaries have always been willing to make.

## Epilogue

When his relatively serious attacks on PIL seemed to cut no ice, Justice Katju
resorted to what can only be called devastating parody. He provided a most vivid
portrayal of the amazingly protean possibilities of PIL in a two-judge Bench
that he was heading in 2009. His actions were part immanent critique and part
Brechtian satire that I had the privilege to witness.

A PIL had been filed in 2001 by a debarred Chennai lawyer about the poor
condition of wetlands in India.[^5/61] The various governments were asked to file
replies but nothing much happened till 2009, when the case came before Katju.
He decided that reviving all the wetlands in India was too small a matter to
be dealt with in one case. He wanted to make the PIL into 'the water matter',
where all the endemic water problems facing the country would come before
him. The analogy drawn was to 'the forest matter', that has taken over the
forest governance of the country, heard every week on Friday afternoons for
two hours by a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court (since 2010, heard by
two such Benches).

Katju ordered:

>The present _Writ Petition_ under Article 32 of the Constitution of India
relates to conservation of wet lands which in our opinion would include
ponds, tanks, canals, creeks, water channels, reservoirs, rivers, streams and
lakes. Although, the _writ petition_ as framed related to protection of wetlands
in the country for preservation of the environment and maintaining the
ecology, we have _suo motu_ expanded its scope as mentioned below.

The court had its own diagnosis of the water problems facing the country:

>There is acute shortage of water in our country and one of the main reasons
for that is that most of the water conservation bodies in our country such
as ponds, tanks, small lakes etc. have been filled up in recent times by some
greedy persons and such persons have constructed buildings, shops etc. on
the same. Our ancestors were wise people who realized that because of
droughts or some other reasons there may be shortage of water in future and
hence they made the provision of a pond near every village, tanks in or near
temples, etc.

And its own solutions, which Katju had already expressed himself in another
judgment that he had passed earlier that year, in which he gratuitously held forth
on water scarcity in India in an interstate water dispute.[^5/62]

But this time, his words carried the force of law. Katju ordered:

>(the) Central Government to immediately constitute a body of eminent
scientists in the field who should be requested to do scientific research in
this area on a war footing to find out scientific ways and means of solving the
water shortage problem in the country.[^5/63]

It was also recommended that:

>The said body shall be given all the financial, technical and administrative
>help by the Central and State Governments for this purpose. The said body
>of scientists was requested to, _inter alia_, perform the following tasks:
>
>(i) to find out an inexpensive method or methods of converting saline
>water into fresh water.
>
>(ii) to find out an inexpensive and practical method of utilizing the water,
>which is in the form of ice, in the Himalayas.
>
>(iii) to find out a viable method of utilizing rain water.
>
>(iv) to utilize the flood water by harnessing the rivers so that the excess
>water in the floods, may instead of causing damage, be utilized for the
>people who are short of water, or be stored in reservoirs for use when
>there is drought.[^5/64]

The _Times of India_ reported this order with bemusement:

>A Bench headed by Justice Markandey Katju, who is known for his strict
approach towards PILs and his conviction that administration cannot be run
by the courts through such litigation, issued notice to the ministry of science
and technology to tell the court about the follow-up action it has taken since
his recommendations on February 6 in an inter-state water dispute case. The
reaction of the Bench, also comprising Justice V Sudershan Reddy, may have
surprised counsel Gopal Shankaranarayan, who appearing for petitioner M
K Balakrishnan had been toiling for the past couple of years to convince the
apex court for some urgent action to protect the disappearing wetlands vitally
affecting the water table, flora and fauna. But, he would not complain for the
Bench while expanding the scope of the PIL said that the prayers would
include all methods needed to solve water shortage problems, including
converting sea water into fresh water and water in snow cap peaks.[^5/65]

Katju wanted this PIL to be heard by him every month. The case was heard
seven times in 2009 while he was on the Bench. The Secretary, Ministry of Science
and Technology, Union of India filed in August 2009 the first progress report
of the 'Technology Mission: Winning, Augmentation and Renovation for Water
(WAR for Water)', formulated as a result of the orders in this case. The petitioner
was enjoying his moment of reflected glory and had made copies of the report for
all the members of the press.

After Katju retired, this case was not listed by the Supreme Court for years.
Not much came out of it, but Katju had provided a textbook demonstration of the
amazing powers that PIL gave a judge. Perhaps nothing brings home the dangers
of PIL as much as the fact that it gave free rein to a judge as mercurial as Katju.

based on that argues, 'This suggests that PIL does not drain significant court resources
from the administration of day-to-day justice, contrary to the claims of some critics;
but it also suggests that the outsize reputation of the Supreme Court's PIL work
belies its modest scale.' This is an over-interpretation because even though in absolute
numbers, PIL cases are relatively few, many of these cases individually take more of
court's time than many a jurisdiction. For instance, a whole afternoon session of a
three-judge Bench has been devoted every week to the forest PIL case alone for more
than a decade. Similarly, in a system where many PIL cases are never supposed to end
but accrue fresh causes of action from time to time, as we saw with WP (C) 4677/1985
in Chapter 2, it is misleading to look at fresh filings alone.

[^5/30]: Of course, even the above two important examples pale into insignificance before the
Indian Supreme court's so-called 'right to life jurisprudence' under Article 21 which
has been extrapolated to such an extent that it includes all kinds of socio-economic
rights. The only right it seems to exclude is the literal mandate of Article 21, a negative
right against any deprivation of life or personal liberty by the state in an illegal manner.
Since the 1980s, which have been the heyday of PIL, the Indian Supreme Court has
upheld the constitutionality of a whole alphabet soup of repressive laws violative of
Article 21 simpliciter. While this article became a receptacle for all manners of positive
rights, the simple civil right it was meant to embody does not get the importance it
is due. Of course, the problem here is not with the court reading an unnamed socioeconomic
right into the existing provisions listed in the Fundamental Rights chapter.
The difficulty arises because of its reckless refusal to do minimal hermeneutic labour
to be able to invoke such rights in a robust way. But in the new scheme of things, such
qualities of juristic activism no longer mattered.

[^5/41]: According to Article 145(3) of the Constitution, the court is required to sit in a
bench of at least five judges to decide any case 'involving a substantial question of
law as to the interpretation' of the Constitution. Such five-judge or larger benches are
traditionally known as constitutional benches. A recent study has shown that 'while
the Court averaged about a 100 five-judge or larger benches a year in the 1960s, by the
first decade of the 2000s, this had decreased to about nine a year. Viewed in this light,
despite deciding about 5,000 regular hearing cases a year in the 2000s, the Indian
Supreme Court arguably produces less jurisprudence involving substantial questions
of constitutional law than a Court like the United States Supreme Court, which
wrote just 72 judgments in 2009, but whose cases often involved such questions.' The
Supreme Court of India has thus increasingly been functioning more like a final court
of appeal and less as a Constitutional Court. The same study concludes, 'The Supreme
Court's attention has been diverted by thousands of more mundane decisions at
the
expense of developing its constitutional jurisprudence. As of November 2010, there
were 754 ﬁve-judge or larger matters pending to be heard for regular hearing in the
Supreme Court.' See Nick Robinson _et al._, 'Interpreting the Constitution: Supreme
Court Constitution Benches since Independence', _Economic and Political Weekly_, 26
February 2011.

arguably the best critique of it is difficult to find in India.
