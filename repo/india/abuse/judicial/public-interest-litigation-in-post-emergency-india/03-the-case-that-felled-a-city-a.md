In 1984--85 a lawyer named M. C. Mehta filed a bunch of Public Interest
Litigation (PIL) cases in the Supreme Court of India. These cases were fated
to be landmarks in the history of PIL in India. They are generally discussed as
the archetypical environmental PILs, which set the pace of judicial intervention in
urban governance and environmental regulation in India.[^3/3] In narrating the story of
PIL, these cases are usually read as signalling a new era, shifting the focus of PIL
away from the dominant concerns of poverty and judicial reform to the subject
of environment. My focus in this chapter, however, will be on the pioneering
innovations introduced in these PIL cases. These cases have been trailblazers in
exploring the boundless potentialities of PIL in India, particularly in Delhi. I will
foreground these trendsetting procedural novelties and the politics immanent in
them. The shifts that these cases brought about in PIL were not only in terms of
its ideological concerns, but also in terms of the very nature of its process. This is
the story I shall try to narrate here.

Four of these M. C. Mehta PILs from 1984--85 are still going on after three
decades, with no end in sight. The unending nature of these cases provides us a
hint as to their unique nature. These four vintage PILs still thriving are the cases
popularly known as the _Taj Mahal Pollution case_[^3/4], the _Ganga Pollution case_[^3/5], the
_Delhi Vehicular Pollution case_[^3/6] and the particular case that I will be focusing on
here, _Writ Petition_ (Civil) 4677/1985. No such simple moniker would work for
the latter case as its very _cause of action_, i.e. its central dispute shifted, not once,
but multiple times in the last three decades. It started with a plea against stone-crushing
units, then concerned itself with pollution in the river Yamuna, then with
the condition of Delhi's Ridge Forest and with mining in the Aravalli mountain
ranges, but its most famous targets were Delhi's hazardous large industries, then
'non-confirming' industries and finally and most spectacularly, it became known as
the 'sealing' case against commercial establishments in residential areas in Delhi. The
story of this PIL case can be narrated as the story of Delhi's urban transformation
in the last three decades as it singlehandedly led to large-scale deindustrialization
of the city, and it performed this task assiduously and relentlessly. But the question
that is worth posing here is: why and how did PIL emerge as the primary agent of
this transformation. While Delhi, just like many other cities, saw massive changes
in its political economy in this period with a move from industry to services, what
marks Delhi's dislocations as distinct is their source and their basis --- they are based
not, as in the past, on administrative or municipal policy or executive directions,
but on judicial directions in a single PIL case concerning pollution in the city. The
spectacular efficacy of a PIL case in carrying out such a role, I would argue, can
be explained not just by the external ideological trends prevailing at the time, but
also by the peculiar nature of PIL itself. While WP 4677/1985 became a means
of spectacular urban transformation, it also broke fresh ground for PIL itself as a
perennially unstable and fundamentally malleable jurisdiction.

WP 4677/1985 has been dealt with by most of the leading charismatic PIL
judges of the last three decades from Justice Bhagwati to Justice Kuldip Singh and
Justice Sabharwal, making it particularly fertile as a case study for the history of
PIL. While the focus of this chapter will be on this one case, I will begin with a
brief discussion of another of the still surviving M. C. Mehta cases of 1985, the
_vehicular pollution case_, in so far as it resonates with the particular case at hand.
While the M. C. Mehta cases were first admitted by Justice Bhagwati in 1985, these
cases scaled new heights in the early 1990s with Justice Kuldip Singh at the helm,
enabling him to establish a reputation as a 'green judge'. The style of functioning
of his court at this time can be discerned from the following description provided
in 1995 by Shyam Divan, then a young environmental lawyer:

>A public interest litigation to clean up the Ganga has caught the judge's
fancy. Each Friday a huge shoal of advocates, administrators, company
executives, and public officials attentively follow the court proceedings as a
range of snappy judicial directions are issued ... The Ganga court functions a
bit like a _village panchayat_ dispensing justice in the shade of a banyan tree.
The rigour of formal court procedures and statutory requirements are diluted
in favour of a summary, result-oriented process.[^3/7]

To characterize such a peculiar attempt to mimic 'traditional justice' in the
hallowed portals of India's Supreme Court with its liveried attendants in turbans
and full Raj-style regalia, perhaps a more appropriate analogy would be the
medieval court or _durbar_ rather than a _village panchayat_. Justice Hidayatullah
had anticipated this and as early as 1984, he thought it fit to compare PIL with
Moghul Emperor Jehangir's:

>Zanjir-e-Adl --- a gold chain which he had hung from his apartment to the
ground. Supplicants used to give a tug to ring a bell in his private apartment
and the emperor would before a _jharoka_ (window) and hear and decide the
complaint in person.[^3/8]

While J. Kuldip Singh's judicial conduct set new standards for PIL judges, it
was not fated to be exceptional for too long, as we shall see.

## The _Delhi Vehicular Pollution case_

_Writ Petition_ (Civil) 13029/1985, better known as the Delhi vehicular pollution
case, was to lead to a complete overhaul of public and private transport in the
city. Its impact started to be felt with a series of orders in the mid-1990s. Its
initial orders included the phasing out of leaded gasoline, the introduction of
pre-mixed fuels for two-stroke engine vehicles and the removal of 15-year-old
commercial vehicles. But, soon to come in this case was the most famous of its
decisions --- to order all commercial public transport vehicles to change from diesel
or petrol to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), which was seen as a 'green' fuel.
The decisions were actually taken at the behest of a fact-finding body called the
Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, abbreviated as EPCA
and commonly referred to as the Bhure Lal Committee after its chairman, who
was then a member of the Central Vigilance Commission. The EPCA had been
appointed as a statutory body on 28 January 1998 under the orders of the court.
This five-member committee was initially composed of a representative from the
Central Pollution Control Board, the Automobile Manufacturers Association of
India, the Centre for Science and Environment (an environmental NGO) and the
Transport Department of Delhi, besides the Chairman.[^3/9] Because the committee
was designed to express the interests and expertise of the major affected parties,
the Supreme Court has since 1998 consistently looked to the committee as its
fact-finding commission and has relied almost exclusively on its findings when
making its decisions in this case.[^3/10] Of course, the court did not always follow
EPCA recommendations --- the most prominent example of such an instance being
the fate of diesel-fuelled private vehicles. As a 2004 article on this case notes:

>The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA)
recommended that private diesel cars should not be registered and that the
Supreme Court should freeze sales of diesel cars. Lawyers for the automobile
industry strenuously opposed this. Instead of following the EPCA
recommendation, the Court ordered only that all private cars must conform
to engine standards by new, tighter deadlines.[^3/11]

Another glaring instance of the court's skewed sense of priorities in this case
was when it did follow EPCA recommendations and made a direction (on the
same day as the CNG order) to augment the number of public transport buses
in Delhi to 10,000 by 1 April 2001.[^3/12] But the court did not make any significant
effort to implement this order (while its other orders were causing havoc) and
even in 2016, Delhi has much less than 10,000 public buses in its fleet.

The petitioner M. C. Mehta was active in the _Delhi vehicular pollution case_
till 1995. Thereafter, the court relied on Harish Salve, a senior lawyer who was
appointed as the _amicus curiae_ --- literally 'friend of the court', a court-designated
position that became increasingly common in PIL cases around this period, as we
saw in Chapter 1. The crucial role that the _amicus_ played here has been described
thus: 'In this case, the _amicus curiae_ was a combination of special master and
advisor to the justices'.[^3/13] He collected and sorted out factual material and distilled
from the numerous affidavits and other representations submitted to the court a
_pr√©cis_ of their perspectives. At several critical junctures, Salve did factual research
to debunk what he described as 'extravagant claims' and otherwise played a central
role in moving the case forward.[^3/14] For a case of citywide scope, only a relatively
small number of stakeholders actually played much of a role in the deliberations.

On 28 July 1998, the Supreme Court issued its order that all public transport
in Delhi would be converted to run on CNG by 1 April 2001.[^3/15] The CNG order
included buses, taxis and auto rickshaws, some 100,000 vehicles in all.[^3/16] This was
immensely controversial because the science behind it was severely contested, with
two committees giving diametrically opposite reports regarding the advisability of
adopting diesel or CNG.[^3/17] Even if the problem of pollution in Delhi was widely
acknowledged to be severe, many alternative solutions to this dismal situation
had been suggested. The most controversial aspect of the court's solution was that
private vehicles were relatively unaffected, while public transport was made to
bear the brunt --- directly affecting the livelihoods of people employed in public
transport. There was a sudden drop in the number of public buses available. The
effect of this forced change of fuel on bus personnel and commuters was drastic.

The drivers of auto rickshaws (officially known as TSRs: 'Three-wheeled
scooter rickshaws') were particularly badly hit. The changeover from petrol to
CNG engines required a relatively large monetary investment, which most auto
rickshaw drivers were not in position to make and bank loans were hardly available
to them. They ended up taking usurious loans from private financiers. Besides,
CNG was not actually available in sufficient quantity for many years, even after it
had been imposed as the only fuel for auto rickshaws. This led to extreme hardship,
as auto rickshaw drivers would normally have to queue for 3--4 hours to refuel
their vehicles, which affected their workdays very adversely. Serpentine queues of
dozens of auto rickshaws outside gas stations were to become a normal sight in
Delhi in the first few years of the twenty-first century.

The auto rickshaw drivers' situation was further exacerbated by an earlier
order of the Supreme Court in this same case in 1997, which stated that:

>It would be in the interest of the environment, to freeze the number of TSRs
for the present at the level at which they are actually in use in the city. We,
therefore, direct that there would be no grant of fresh permits in respect of
the TSR, save and except by way of replacement of an existing working TSR
with a new one.[^3/18]

The result of this court-ordered permit freeze was catastrophic for auto-rickshaw
drivers. In 2010, the EPCA found that, according to the Transport
Department of the Government of Delhi, the number of registered three-wheelers
in the city was 55,236, while 72,429 of them had existed in 1997.[^3/19]
There was, thus, a substantial 'decline' in absolute numbers of auto rickshaws in
Delhi between 1997 and 2010. Simultaneously, by 2010, as the EPCA observed,
the city was registering over 1,000 new private vehicles every day. In the period
from 1997 to 2011, thus while private vehicles increased manifold, the Supreme
Court's freeze on TSRs resulted in an artificial scarcity of permits.

The decline in the number of auto rickshaws in Delhi's streets was thus due
to the combined effect of the Supreme Court's TSR freeze order of 1997 and
its enforcement of CNG conversion soon after. In 2002, the court did allow a
minuscule 5,000 new permits to be issued, but otherwise the number of TSRs
remained stagnant till 2011, when the court finally allowed 45,000 new permits
after the TSR unions approached it in August 2009 and prayed for relief from
the freeze 'in view of the increase in population and increase in the number of
vehicles during the past several years'. The court asked the EPCA to examine the
matter afresh and requested it 'to give a report as regards the needfulness for fresh
permissions for three wheelers'.[^3/20]

The situation that then prevailed was explained in a 2010 report on auto
rickshaws in Delhi:

>The permit cap created a gap between the supply of autos and the growing
demand from Delhi's increasing population. A black market for auto permits
soon emerged and the price of an auto permit rose dramatically. Just a year
later owner-drivers were ordered to replace their autos or convert them
to CNG by fitting expensive conversion kits. Unable to afford the Rs.25--30,000
CNG kits, thousands of owner drivers had no option but to sell their
autos and permits to financiers at bargain prices, further focusing power in
the hands of the consolidating finance 'mafia'.[^3/21]

The black market price of an auto rickshaw with the permit increased to
6.5 lakh rupees by 2011, while the cost of the auto rickshaw itself was only 1.4
lakhs --- a difference of more than 5 lakhs.[^3/22] In November 2011 when the Supreme
Court finally allowed 45,000 new autorickshaw licences to be granted, the market
price immediately crashed and went down to as low as 2.5 lakh rupees.[^3/23] The
creation of this black market in TSRs was purely a result of the Supreme Court's
decision, as can be gauged from the results of revoking it. Already, the order about
change in fuel had made many auto rickshaw owners take loans from private
financiers, and when they were unable to pay these back, they had to transfer
their permits to these financiers. Studies have shown that before the Supreme
Court's double whammy, most auto rickshaws were owned by drivers themselves,
but the effect of the fuel change and the permit freeze was that almost the entire
fleet of auto rickshaws came under the control of financiers and drivers were
converted into wage labourers.[^3/24] Even the EPCA recognized in 2010 that 'the
bulk of the vehicles on road are owned by a limited number of people who rent
these to drivers on a charge of around '250--300 for an 8-hour shift.' By the time
the EPCA recommended the removal of the cap on auto rickshaws, recognizing
their importance as public transport and finally understanding the impact of the
court-ordered freeze, great harm had been done to all concerned. As its 2010
report noted:

>EPCA has noted that the current crisis of pollution in the city and its adjoining
areas is largely because of the exponential growth of private vehicles. The
only option for the city in the future is to provide a viable and reliable public
transport system, which will restrain the use of private vehicles on the roads.
The three-wheeler plays an important role in providing an intermediate
public transport facility. It remains cheaper to operate as compared to any
four-wheeled vehicle and removal of the cap and the high transaction costs
associated with it will bring down the cost of capital drastically and provide
space for improvement of the service on road. Removal of cap will also help
in eliminating the dominating hold of 'financier's mafia' who are exploiting
not only the drivers but also general public by pushing up artificially the
capital cost of 3-wheelers and hence the operational cost.

Both these decisions --- the permit freeze and the CNG changeover --- in the
Delhi pollution case were taken without even giving the city's auto rickshaw
drivers and their representatives a chance to argue their side of the story. I was
witness in August 2009 to the proceedings of this case. An application had been
filed in the Supreme Court for its permission to increase the number of permits
for auto rickshaws that had been fixed in 2002. The lawyer for the autorickshaw
union had just begun his oral submission pleading for notice to be issued in this
case because seven years had passed since the freeze and the rationale for the
original order of 1997 --- that auto rickshaws were polluting vehicles --- was now
irrelevant since the CNG fuel now used was eco-friendly. If notice had been
issued, the application would in any case have been examined by EPCA, and based
on their recommendation, the court would have considered granting permission.
But the _amicus curiae_ Harish Salve weighed in, opposing the application itself.
His contention was that the presence of auto rickshaws on Delhi roads led to
traffic congestion, because of which motor vehicles generally had to spend more
time in stationary mode with engines on, leading to further pollution, therefore
even CNG-fuelled auto rickshaws would cause pollution. Presumably, in Salve's
reasoning, the introduction of thousands of motor vehicles in the city on a daily
basis would cause no such problem. No authorities were cited by Salve and this
was an extempore objection by him. This is just to provide an inkling of the kind
of judicial processes through which decisions are made in such PIL cases.

In this case, which transformed Delhi's roads, the Supreme Court displayed
a stark preference for imposing disproportionate environmental costs on public
transport while allowing private transport to thrive, even though the latter was
the cause of most of the vehicular pollution in Delhi. The case induced a marked
increase in private transport, which expanded so exponentially since the court's
actions of the late 1990s that the reduction in carbon emissions of public transport
vehicle was over a period more than compensated for by the rise of private vehicles,
particularly diesel vehicles.

An ideological interpretation of this case can rightly be made, as it significantly
worsened the livelihood of thousands of poor informal sector transport workers in
the name of environmental problems and the need for clean fuel, while stimulating
the demand and supply of private automobiles, just when this sector was opening up
in a post-liberalization Indian economy. While such an interpretation would not be
incorrect, I would instead ask a different question: why was the court the instrument
of such a major policy change? And how was this forced transition carried out?

The Supreme Court acted supposedly on purely environmental grounds,
marshalling the spectre of vehicular pollution without adequately considering the
impact its interventions would have on vulnerable sections of the population who
live a hand-to-mouth existence, and without making any effort to cushion them
from the harsh economic effects of such a transition. There was a callousness at
work in which a blinkered and absolutist idea of environmentalism --- sociologist
Amita Baviskar called it '_bourgeois_ environmentalism'[^3/25] --- was imposed, where the
poor are bizarrely and conveniently seen as responsible for urban pollution and
have to bear disproportionately the costs of moving to a more ecologically benign
system. While Baviskar's diagnosis of such a trend is persuasive and spot on, it
is worth reflecting on why PIL emerged as the most powerful weapon for this
phenomenon of '_bourgeois_ environmentalism'. While a class-based ideologically
inflected worldview among appellate judges is hardly new and indeed is part and
parcel of any realist understanding of judicial behaviour, PIL empowers judges to
take their predilections much further than ordinary adjudication. It is the ability
to enact and materialize a particular worldview that makes PIL so especially
effective. I would argue that PIL was uniquely suited to impose such a worldview,
not just because many judges shared it, but also because the extreme malleability
of PIL empowered them to carry it out. In fact, the repeated exclusion of adversely
affected parties from even getting a hearing that we see throughout the history
of these 'environmental' PIL cases is symptomatic of the fact that the class-based
exclusions of '_bourgeois_ environmentalism' gets materially inscribed within the
adjudicatory processes of PIL.

Soon after this forced change of fuel to CNG, there was an appreciable drop
in vehicular pollution in Delhi. The effects seemed to last for about a decade, after
which the problem resurfaced, as the number of private vehicles had increased so
much in the meantime that their combined emissions neutralized the reduced
pollution caused by public transport. But the interesting thing about this is not the
ideological aspect as much as the ability of the Supreme Court to ride roughshod
over the interests of tens of thousands of people employed in 'non-corporate
capital'[^3/26], with the unspoken assumption that they could be made redundant or
ignored. This kind of blinkered obliviousness is simply not conceivable by any
democratic regime in India. The only time the Indian state could carry out such a
draconian measure was perhaps during the Emergency regime. And therein you
have the unique power of the court, which as many critics have argued[^3/27], play a
very careful negotiating role when it comes to high politics, but as we have seen
here, can take an intransigent stand when it comes to vulnerable groups. It is not
irrelevant that many of these decisions were made during the period of 1998--2004,
when Jagmohan, the principal architect of the Emergency era 'cleaning up'
of Delhi as the then Vice Chairman of the Delhi Development Authority, held
office in the NDA government at the Centre, as we will see in the next section.

WP(C) 13029/1985 continues to thrive in the Supreme Court with the same
_amicus curiae_ Mr Harish Salve, who has held this position in this PIL for two
decades now. This means, he is much more conversant with this case than any judge
who hears it, because typically a Supreme Court judge would officiate in such a
case for 2--3 years at the most. In the other unending mammoth PIL, popularly
known as 'the _forest case_', in which Salve has served as _amicus_ for a similar period,
I have had a chance to witness him address and brief a new incumbent judge
joining 'the Forest Bench', so that the latter would also be acquainted with the
background and glorious history of the case.[^3/28] The story of many landmark PIL
cases is often written, with good reason, in terms of the judges heading the bench
and is identified with their charisma, Justice Kuldip Singh being a good example.
But perhaps the time has come to narrate the history of some other more recent
PILs in terms of the charismatic _amicus curiae_ involved in them, as they play
a no less crucial role in steering the case in new directions. During its hearings
during 2014--15, the veteran _amicus_ in WP(C) 13029/85 was assisting the court
in supervising the construction of two big road projects --- the Western and
Peripheral Expressway, which would re-route vehicular traffic away from Delhi
and thus reduce traffic and pollution in the city.

## WP(C) 4677/1985: The many-headed Hydra

The focus of the rest of this chapter will be on one of the other still active PIL
cases \[_Writ Petition_ (Civil) Number 4677\] filed by M. C. Mehta in 1985, which
changed the face of Delhi more than any other case. It is generally regarded as a
case concerning industrial pollution in Delhi as it famously led to the removal of
industries from the city, in the name of implementing city-zoning laws[^3/29], but this
was just one of the many achievements of this PIL. The Master Plan of Delhi would
get so much attention as a result of this case that it became a paperback bestseller
during the mid-2000s. But WP(C) 4677/1985 initially started with a plea against
stone-crushing units, which were alleged to be causing dust pollution in the city.
Three hundred such units were closed down under court orders in 1992.[^3/30] Already,
in a sign of things to come, after discussing the chaos in implementing these
closure orders, leading legal commentators observed, 'one may wonder whether
the Supreme Court of India can have the time and resources for the above sort
of micro-management'.[^3/31] No lessons were learnt from this experience, however.
Such chaos was repeated cyclically multiple times in the future avatars of this
case and in ever-increasing scale, as we shall see. The PIL case did not come to
a close with the achievement of the objective with which it was first filed. The
continuation of the case after the decree of closing down the stone crushing units
was passed was not merely to monitor the implementation of its judgment, but to
take up fresh _causes of action_. The closure of the units, in retrospect, was merely an
unmarked blip in the juggernaut that this case became.

The petitioner M. C. Mehta soon thereafter filed a number of interlocutory
applications (IAs) in this same case relating to other aspects of pollution in Delhi.
The initial ones related to pollution in the river Yamuna and led to the setting up
of sewage treatment plants and common effluent treatment plants.[^3/32] But a big area
of intervention in this phase of this case was the ridge forest of Delhi, which the
court wanted to protect in its 'pristine glory'. On 9 May 1996, the court directed
that the ridge be made free of all 'encroachers', as per the terms of the Delhi Master
Plan. This would impact over 30,000 residents living in three colonies adjacent to
the Asola Wildlife Sanctuary. The affected residents were nomadic tribals, who
used to work in the erstwhile _Bhatti_ mines of this area. As Ravi Agarwal notes,
'under direction from the Supreme Court they were asked to relocate, even though
many adjoining private farmhouses were left untouched.'[^3/33] Some of the tribal
residents managed to resist eviction through political negotiations, but their fate
remains precarious.

Another application, IA no. 29, relating to mining operations near Badkal
Lake and Surajkund tourist resorts in the state of Haryana near Delhi, was filed
in this PIL by the petitioner. The court barred any mining activity within two
kilometres of these resorts by an order dated 10 May 1996.[^3/34] A spin off of these
IAs was the court's intervention in curtailing mining in the Aravalli hills, a matter
that this case continues to grapple with even after nearly two decades. The nature
of the orders passed in this PIL under each of these heads was such that even
after the court definitively pronounced on many of these issues, the implications
of each of these were so wide and implementation so complicated with so many
affected parties who were often not even represented, that each of them took years
of the Supreme Court's time and some are still on. As the case became larger and
larger, the numbering of the numerous IAs filed by various parties in the various
branches of this case became more and more unwieldy. As early as 11 November
2002, the order sheet of a hearing in this case lists an item it was dealing with
as I.A.No.1782/2001 in I.A.No.1172 in I.A.No.22 in _Writ Petition_ (Civil)
No.4677/1985.[^3/35] This one _writ petition_ had so many heads that it really was like a
many-headed hydra. Conventional modes of legal analysis would struggle to make
sense of a juridical beast such as this PIL.

With Justice Kuldip Singh at the helm in the 1990s, this case almost singlehandedly
led to the deindustrialization of Delhi (before Justice Y. K. Sabharwal
led it in a slightly different tangent from 2005). The first significant step in this
direction culminated on 8 July 1996 with the court ordering the relocation of 168
large industries from Delhi within five months. The court reasoned:

>Delhi is recording heavy population growth since 1951. As the city grows,
its problems of land, housing, transportation and management of essential
infrastructure like water supply and sewage have become more acute. Delhi
is one of the most polluted cities in the world. The quality of ambient air is so
hazardous that lung and respiratory diseases are on the increase. The city has
become a vast and unmanageable conglomeration of commercial, industrial,
unauthorised colonies, resettlement colonies and unplanned housing. There
is total lack of open spaces and green areas. Once a beautiful city, Delhi now
presents a chaotic picture. The only way to relieve the capital city from the
huge additional burden and pressures is to deconcentrate the population,
industries and economic activities in the city and relocate the same in various
priority towns in the NCR.[^3/36]

The court's order was as per the 'Second Master Plan for Delhi --- Perspective
2001' (henceforth, the Master Plan) notified in 1990 which specifically provided
that the hazardous/noxious/heavy/large industries were not permitted to operate in
the city of Delhi and the existing industrial units falling in these categories were to
be shifted/relocated outside city limits. These industries were either characterized
in the Delhi Master Plan's Annexure III as 'H(a) category' meaning 'Hazardous
and noxious industries' or 'H(b) category' meaning 'heavy and large industries'.

The court ordered that if the factory owners choose to relocate to a
neighbouring district, they would have to pay each worker monthly wages during
the period of the move, as well as one year's salary as a resettlement bonus. If
owners opted to close their factories, workers would be entitled to six years'
wages as a retrenchment allowance. Two years later, it was found that only one
out of the 168 industries had paid any compensation to the workers.[^3/37] In any
case, the liability of the factory management was limited to the narrowest possible
definition of 'workmen', those who were on the rolls as permanent employees.[^3/38]
An estimated of 35,000--50,000 workers were rendered jobless because of this
court-enforced relocation, but were not even heard by the court until after the
closure of the factories.[^3/39] A new federation of trade unions and other human
rights organizations was formed in December 1996 as a response to the Supreme
Court's orders called Delhi Janwadi Adhikar Manch (DJAM --- Delhi Socialist
Rights Forum).[^3/40] The Manch tried to intervene in court, but as Amita Baviskar
records:

>Three trade unions affiliated with the Manch approached the bench
separately through their lawyers, asking to be heard in the air pollution
case. The judges brushed them aside, merely remarking that the court would
protect workers' interests and did not need the intercession of the unions.
This verbal assurance was not recorded as a part of court proceedings.[^3/41]

Later again:

> ... when the Manch approached the Supreme Court and pointed out that the
judges' orders were being violated, the court suggested that they take their
complaints to the labor commissioner, an official whose previous inaction had
already demonstrated his total lack of interest in protecting workers' rights.[^3/42]

The closure suited many of the industries. The bigger ones were anyway keen
to shut down or relocate, but Indian labour laws made closure of an industrial
establishment almost impossible. The court's intervention gave them a timely
opportunity. Not only that, this order provided them a real bonanza as they were
free to dispose at least 32% of the industrial land as commercial real estate,
land that had been earlier given to them by the government at heavily subsidized
rates. The court was not unaware of this as it noted, 'In view of the huge increase
of prices of land in Delhi the reuse of the vacant land is bound to bring a lot
of money which can meet the cost of relocation.'[^3/43] On the other hand, it was
estimated that the total number of people directly affected by loss of employment
(workers and their families) as a result of these orders exceeded 250,000.[^3/44]

Within three months of the July 1996 order, the court also ordered in the
same case the relocation or closure of another 513 factories, 46 hot mix plants, 21
arc/induction furnaces and 243 brick kilns, all of which were to be closed down or
moved by 1997. This spate of 1996--97 orders was only the first of the many major
developments in this case that completely reordered the city. Already, even at that
early stage, it was perceived as signalling a new trend. As Baviskar noted:

>The partnership of environmentalists M. C. Mehta and Kuldip Singh,
advocate and judge, which resulted in directives that affected the lives and
livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers and their families, people
who had no representation in court, exemplifies the new efficient dispensation
of justice in the 'public interest' that middle-class people acclaim.[^3/45]

The case continued though the _dramatis personae_ changed. By the late 1990s,
an _amicus curiae_ was appointed in this case --- _senior advocate_ Ranjit Kumar --- as
was the general trend in PIL cases. The public interest petitioner M. C. Mehta
now participated only intermittently, if at all, and henceforth Kumar was to play a
key role in the future directions that the case took.

In 2000 came the next major development in the deindustrializing
trajectory of this case. This time, the scale was even bigger as the order was to
close/relocate all 'non-conforming' industrial units, i.e. factories located in areas
designated as 'residential' in the Delhi Master Plan, the attempt being to strictly
enforce Delhi's zoning laws.[^3/46] The stage was set in 1996 itself when the court
asked Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) for information on the
number of polluting and non-polluting units running in non-conforming areas.
The resulting survey put the figure of industries in Delhi at 126,218 units, with
97,411 of them being non-conforming.[^3/47] It was decided that only 'household
industries' --- those that did not pollute, employed fewer than five workers, used
no more than one kilowatt of power and occupied an area smaller than 30
square metres --- would be licensed and allowed to continue where they were. But
only 5% of 51,000 units that applied for these licences could meet these
stringent criteria.[^3/48] On 1 April 1996, the court ordered the rest to be relocated by 1 January 1997. But a fundamental problem arose. There was no place to relocate
them as there were not enough industrial plots as envisaged in the Master Plan.
Only after the order was passed in 1996, a government developer called the
Delhi State Industrial Development Corporation (DSIDC) began to acquire
land in Bawana, on the Northern outskirts of the city, where small factories
from residential areas could relocate. The court meanwhile allowed those factory
owners who had applied to the DSIDC for alternate plots temporary licenses
to continue operating in their old locations. The court asked the government
to submit quarterly reports about the progress in complying with its orders.
In September 1999, the court heard the case again and fixed the deadline for
relocation for 31 December 1999. Eventually by July 2000, 52,000 factories had
applied for alternate plot allotments, but not a single factory had been relocated.
Because it had still not finished developing the industrial land, DSIDC in 2000
asked the Supreme Court for an extension until March 2004 to develop the
Bawana industrial properties.[^3/49]

The court at this point lost all patience with the relocation process and
on 12 September 2000, it ordered that 'all polluting industries of whatever
category operating in residential areas must be asked to shut down'. This judicial
exasperation with the mendacity and inefficiency of the government would lead to
massive devastation in the lives of Delhi's labouring class. As factory owners later
complained, 'They were bearing the brunt of the punishment that ought to have
been meted out to the state for its inaction'.[^3/50]

It was as if the court had no duty to take care of workers' interests in this
massive relocation exercise --- that duty was the concern of the government
alone. When, after the 31 December 1999 deadline lapsed and the process was
nowhere near completion, the Supreme Court issued a notice in November 2000
to the government representatives that they would be hauled up for contempt
for not implementing the court's orders, the government panicked and 'ordered
the immediate closure of 'all' nonconforming industrial units (and not just the
polluting ones)'.[^3/51] Almost a hundred thousand factories were thus closed down
within a week. Government officials, escorted by heavily armed policemen, went
around sealing factory premises, locking their doors, disconnecting electricity
and water supply. Riots ensued, with a general strike on 20 November 2000.
The accompanying violence led to three workers being shot dead by the police
and hundreds injured.[^3/52] The court, soon after these incidents, scolded the
government for closing not just polluting but also non-polluting units. However,
its new deadline for closing all polluting units now was not much later, fixed for 7 January 2001, which was eventually extended till 31 December 2002.[^3/53] In the
intervening chaos of the 2000--03 period, thousands of factories closed down,
though the Delhi government tried and eventually succeeded in liberalizing
the Master Plan norms for factories. The definition of 'household' factories
was liberalized as well as 24 areas with about 20,000 factories and a land use
concentration of 70%+ industrial usage re-designated as 'industrial' and
thus regularized. This issue led to a major political battle between the central
and the state governments, as Delhi's land use planning is in the hands of the
central government.

Kaveri Gill has analyzed the impact of this Supreme Court action on a
specific 'polluting and non-conforming' urban informal industry, that of plastic
recycling, which could ironically otherwise be seen as environment-friendly. This
community of workers, belonging to a _Dalit_ caste called 'Khatik' and working in
the plastic scrap trade, had prior to this case been quite successful in exercising
their political voice around a caste identity. But the interventions of the PIL court
in this case negated their ability to mobilize politically. The usual democratic
channels were bypassed by the Supreme Court. In Gill's analysis:

>The elected representatives of the people, in this case Outer Delhi MLAs
and others, such as former and present chief ministers from both political
parties, were given no avenue to contest the order and influence the course of
policy on the basis of larger trade-offs with poverty and livelihoods in their
constituencies.[^3/54]

The court was thus able to ride roughshod over the negotiations of political
society and able to impose its vision of the city via its apotheosis of zoning laws as
incorporated in the Master Plan.

In September 2000, the court had taken the implementation of the order
out of the hands of the Delhi government, instead appointing 'an independent
nodal agency under the auspices of the Central Government to ensure that the
relocation took place within the desired timeframe'.[^3/55] The Central Minister for
Urban Development was to head this nodal agency. It was not a coincidental
choice of appointee, as the then incumbent was none other than Jagmohan, the
man responsible for the massive Emergency era social engineering in Delhi. The
court showed its hand here, knowing full well that 'Delhi governments lacked
the political will to carry out relocation orders, as it would adversely affect the
livelihood and business of hundreds of thousands of voters,'[^3/56] and that if there
was one person in government who could implement these far-reaching orders,
it was Jagmohan. And soon enough, the relocation orders 'came to be associated
with Jagmohan's office and person' and in the discourse of the displaced, with the
Emergency-era dislocations.[^3/57] The court's actions reminded the factory owners of
the Emergency years, specifically, as Gill notes, because:

>The Supreme Court refused to hear the lawyer representing the collective
body of small-scale traders and manufacturers affected by the relocation
order. Various localityand community-based trade associations had spent
a considerable amount of time and effort raising substantial sums of money
in order to hire a lawyer willing to defend them, only to have the Supreme
Court have him sit down without an adequate hearing.[^3/58]

As with the auto rickshaws, affected parties were not heard by the PIL court,
before sealing their fate. Jagmohan was eventually removed from the Urban
Development Ministry in 2001 at the behest of his own party leaders from Delhi,
when he refused to ratify the change in land use norms to regularize _de facto_
'industrial areas'. He was now made the Tourism Minister, a position in which he
wreaked further havoc, as we shall see in the next chapter.

## WP 4677/1985 becomes 'the _Sealing case_'

After having successfully deindustrialized the city through this single PIL, _Writ
Petition_ (Civil) 4677/1985, the Supreme Court went further down the path of
making Delhi a 'world-class city' with a judgment on 16 February 2006 in this
same case, proclaiming that all commercial units in residential areas would be
closed down. This directive took the zoning logic of the Delhi Master Plan further,
with its clear separation of residential and commercial establishments. This PIL
4677/1985, which till 2005 was officially called 'RE: Shifting of Industries from
Residential Area of Delhi, New Delhi' in its recorded orders, took a new direction
after 17 March 2005, when a bench headed by Justice Y. K. Sabharwal, acting at
the behest of _Amicus Curiae_ Ranjit Kumar, decided 'to hear and decide the issue
of commercialization of residential areas'.

This fateful move would make the case even more infamous than it already
was --- and both the judge and the _amicus_ lawyer would be identified with this new
chapter of the PIL. The court's intervention would affect hundreds of thousands of
commercial establishments in Delhi as the desired zoning separation existed only
on the map. The contradictions between the Master Plan's desired city and the city
that in fact existed was so widespread that many even surmized that the majority
of shops in Delhi would turn out to be in areas demarcated as non-commercial
and would, therefore, be guilty of 'misuse of property'. In fact, the judgment of 16 February 2006 records that the lawyer for MCD had argued that 'since there
is a large scale misuse of residential premises for commercial purposes, it is a
physical impossibility to remove the misuser'. The court reacted with anger: 'Such
a contention is not open to MCD. It is not merely a case of only lack of will to
take action, it appears to be a case of predominance of extraneous considerations.'
The state's role in this process, in the eyes of the court, was seen as tolerating these
illegalities and indeed being complicit in them, partly explained as 'corruption' and
partly as 'vote banks', but often narrated as a jumble of the two. Or, as Justice Y. K.
Sabharwal wrote in a newspaper article about this case after his retirement, 'Judges
decide on law and not on populism'.[^3/59]

The municipal authorities were, therefore, ordered to seal these commercial
properties so that they could no longer be (mis)used. The extreme mismatch
between the _de jure_ and _de facto_ situation here has often been explained away
in terms of the modernist state's attempt to impose Western zoning ideas alien
to Indian sensibilities and, therefore, an impractical hope. But it could, at least
partially, also be attributed to the abject failure of the state authorities, in being able
to implement their own Master Plan. There were projections with a time frame
in the Master Plan for a certain amount of commercial space to be developed for
the expected populations by specific dates. The state, repeating its record with the
industrial estates, did not end up developing even half the commercial space it
was supposed to. The resulting mismatch of supply and demand of commercial
land, not surprisingly, led to shops opening in areas demarcated as 'noncommercial'.
The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was the sole developer,
having acquired agricultural land all over the city in the 1950s and 1960s and
being given the responsibility to develop it. But the DDA completely failed to
provide industrial or commercial or indeed residential properties in the measure
estimated by its own plan document. Without holding the DDA and its failed
monopoly accountable, the court repeatedly penalized the unplanned construction
of industrial, commercial or residential establishments. It went about treating the
symptom rather than the cause. Now, once again, the people who ran commercial
establishments and worked in them were going to be penalized in the name of
clamping down on illegality, without hearing them in this process. The state's
fundamental failure in creating the demand for these illegalities by not delivering
the commercial space it targeted in the Master Plan, was impatiently glossed
over. While the court ignored this omission, it relied on the same document as
gospel to insist on strict enforcement of zoning. It, thus, acted wilfully blind to
the impossibility of what it was demanding, by harping on about illegalities while
ignoring the underlying reason behind it. Because the court had ordered sealing of
commercial establishments in areas not designated as commercial, the case came
to be known as 'the _sealing case_'. It was under that name that the Supreme Court
dominated the newspaper headlines in Delhi in 2006--07.

Once the court had decided to start the crackdown on 'misusers', it asked the
MCD about the process it wanted to adopt to go about this mammoth operation.
The MCD suggested a four-part plan --- start first with a survey of misuse which
would take six months, followed by notices issued to the misusers identified,
then grant an opportunity to them of being heard and finally seal properties,
focusing on the blatant and obvious cases of large-scale misuse. The court had
no patience for following such a process. Instead, it wanted a public notice to be
issued immediately (within 10 days) in major newspapers stating that violators
would have 30 days to stop misuse on their own, and file an affidavit saying they
would themselves close the shop and resume residential use. After 30 days, if
misuse did not stop, MCD would start the process of sealing, starting with major
roads. This was the court's plan of action. What followed, however, was much
more complicated, as for once the court had taken on a really powerful lobby --- the
traders and shopkeepers of Delhi.[^3/60]

Initially, things seemed to be following the court's script. The first public
notice was issued on 26 February 2006, stating that the first phase of sealing
would target those roads with more than 50% commercial misuse as
well as other major roads above a specified width. On 24 March, a little over
a month after the court's initial sealing order of 16 February, some traders'
associations approached the court for more time to stop misuse, and the court
directed that the affidavits for voluntarily ceasing misuse would have to be filed
within the next four days by 28 March, following which they would be given
time till 30 June. But, for those who did not file any affidavits, the sealing action
would commence on 29 March 2006. The 28 March deadline for affidavits was
extended to 7 April, but sealing operations had started by then. Forty thousand
eight hundred affidavits were filed in this allotted time, swearing to stop the
misuse by 30 June[^3/61] and 'giving an undertaking to the effect that violation of
this would ... subject him/her to offence of perjury and contempt of court for
violation of the order of the Court.' But this large number who filed affidavits
was still only a fraction of the total shops affected by the court orders. For the
others, the sealing action had begun, a court-led campaign cheered on by the
drumbeat of the daily newspapers.

Not trusting the municipal bodies' ability and willingness to carry out its
orders without constant prodding, the Supreme Court on 24 March 2006
appointed a monitoring committee, 'in order to oversee the implementation of
the law, namely sealing of offending premises in terms of the letter and spirit
of this Court's directions.' The Committee was headed by Bhure Lal, the retired
bureaucrat who also headed the EPCA, which continued to give reports on
vehicular pollution related issues. The other two members of this Committee were
K. J. Rao, another retired bureaucrat and Major General (Retired) Som Jhingan.
They were allotted office space in Delhi's swanky NGO-cum-cultural hub, the
India Habitat Centre. By this time, the petitioner advocate M. C. Mehta in whose
name the original case was still continuing, 21 years after he filed it, hardly ever
appeared in court. Instead, the _amicus curiae_ Ranjit Kumar had taken charge.
The court had 'directed that all the petitions relating to sealing in Delhi are to
be routed through the learned _Amicus-Curiae_'.[^3/62] This meant that any petition
relating to sealing of any commercial establishment in Delhi had to be dealt
with as part of this case and not independently. And the _amicus_ decided when
and how it was heard by the court. This was really important, as soon there were
thousands of interlocutory applications (IAs) and _Writ Petitions_ filed by owners
of commercial establishments aggrieved by the sealing actions taken pursuant
to court orders. As the court orders were broad and the sealing was to be done
by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), supervised by the Monitoring
Committee, the question often arose of ascertaining whether in a specific case
of an establishment being sealed, it was violating the Master Plan or not. Also,
getting temporary relief for the removal of supplies already stocked up in the
shops, became a repeated cause of affected parties approaching the court. In such a
situation, with the number of applications proliferating in the same case, it became
extremely cluttered and difficult to manage. The _amicus_, who had a monopoly on
deciding which applications would be heard by the court and when, occupied an
increasingly powerful position.

This 1985 PIL _writ petition_ number 4677/1985 was what I call an 'omnibus
PIL'. This meant that the case had become a juggernaut which dealt with, for
example, all aspects relating to 'misuse of properties' at a citywide level, with the
Master Plan being the reference point in deciding the scale of the problem and
its geography, and all other individual cases filed pertaining to this issue would
be deemed to be a part of the omnibus case. Since there were obviously a very
large number of properties affected, only a relatively small number of them could
be sealed every day. The newspapers approvingly reported this sealing process on
a daily basis, with comments by the members of the monitoring committee as
they accompanied the MCD sealing squad. The monitoring committee acquired
a reputation for their zeal in removing the 'illegalities' from the city, and their
activities were vociferously backed by the media and the Resident Welfare
Associations (RWAs), organizations of middle-class residents of gated colonies
that proliferated in Delhi in the 2000s.

The massive outcry from the traders and shopkeepers that followed the
sealing actions under the orders of the court also got public attention, but it was
seen by the newspapers and the courts as coloured by 'political society' and its
illegalities. And 'political society' did indeed intervene, this time speedily unlike
at the time of the relocation of industries. While the state had till now mostly
allowed the court to shape the city as per its wishes, with the sealing matter the
political stakes became too high. The shopkeepers and traders of Delhi had always
been a powerful constituency and both the leading political parties were quite
agitated about sealing, unlike the slum demolitions going on at the same time, as
we shall see in the next chapter.

On 28 March 2006, the day before the sealing was to start, a notification was
issued by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) modifying the Master Plan
insofar as the chapter on mixed use was concerned. The aim was to take a liberal
view regarding mixed land use, i.e. the provision of non-residential activity in
residential premises.[^3/63] The attempt was to give relief to small shopkeepers affected
by the Supreme Court directive, allowing some commercial activities to run in
residential areas. The new policy to legalize commercial activities on the ground
floor of residential premises would be applicable on 118 roads in the capital. This
was, however, still too minuscule a relief and two days after the sealing started,
the traders went on a 48-hour strike amid a flurry of political activity. On 10
April, Delhi traders met the President of India, APJ Abdul Kalam and sought his
intervention, arguing that the business community was neither a petitioner nor
respondent in the PIL under which action was being taken against them. Initially,
the government tried to get a six-month reprieve from the court to 'complete
the exercise of identifying mixed use roads and streets in residential areas within
six months in a systematic and organized manner as per provisions of the Delhi
Master Plan.' But this cut no ice with the court and it criticized the government
for its 'policy of appeasement'. The Bench of Chief Justice Y. K. Sabharwal and
Justice C. K. Thakker observed on 28 April:

>Appeasement causes confusion. We extended the time \[for sealing\] but
meanwhile it \[Centre\] came out with a notification. By doing so what
message you \[Centre\] want to convey to the law abiding citizen ... It is a
deliberate failure because of extraneous considerations at the cost of the
citizen and the message is the law abiding citizen suffers.

The apex court also observed that it was because of the nexus between
government officials, law-enforcing agencies and businessmen that there was
unauthorized commercial use of the residential areas.[^3/64]

Amidst the court's intransigence and bipartisan political support, the
government finally introduced a new law in Parliament called the Delhi Laws
(Special Provisions) Act, 2006. This proposed a one-year moratorium from
punitive action against unauthorized development in the capital and provided
for status quo as on 1 January 2006 of unauthorized development in respect of
mixed land use, construction beyond sanctioned plans and encroachment by slum
dwellers, hawkers and street vendors in the city. On 12 May 2006, the Delhi Laws
(Special Provisions) Bill, 2006 was passed by the Lower House; the Upper House
passed it three days later, and on receipt of assent of the President on 19 May 2006,
it was notified the same day --- an unusually fast pace for a Central legislation. The
very next day, the Government of India issued a notification placing a moratorium
for a period of one year in respect of all notices issued by local authorities
regarding categories of unauthorized development. By the Act and this notice, the
government tried to relieve those who had given an undertaking to the Court, and
also issued directions for removal of seals that had been placed on the premises
till then. As a result, the municipal authorities suspended their sealing drive. By
the time the notification was issued, around 15,000 commercial establishments
functioning in residential areas had already been sealed, out of which 6,000 were
desealed after the court received affidavits from the owners.

The constitutionality of this new statute was challenged immediately and
came up before the same 'sealing' bench of the Supreme Court. Initially, the court
just expressed outrage in oral remarks calling this new law 'wholly invalid and
void', and declared that 'this is pure and simple legislature over-ruling this court'.
The court speculated that the statute might be unconstitutional, but refused to
stay its operation until the constitutionality question had been adjudicated. On 10 August 2006, however, while the court still made oral statements from the
bench that 'though _prima facie_ the Act is an 'invalid' statute, we are not inclined
to completely stay the legislation',[^3/65] it insisted on suspending the notification that
had been passed a day after the Act was passed, as it was seen as expressly trying
to undo and overrule the actions that the court had already taken.

The premise was that even if the sealing of new areas covered under the
moratorium was now barred, the government could not undo actions with respect
to the specific establishments against which the court had already taken action,
either in terms of affidavits filed, undertaking to stop misuse by 30 June or in
cases of establishments already sealed. The court, therefore, ordered the Municipal
authorities to reseal some 5,000 shops, which had been earlier sealed by the court
and then unsealed by the government. The court also ordered the sealing of 40,800
shops that had given affidavits to stop commercial activities on their premises after 15 September (extended from the earlier date of 30 June). Two categories of shops
had emerged --- those who had given affidavits and those who had not.

The government was wrong footed at first and had to undo its earlier
notification by a fresh notice. But amidst the resumption of the sealing, after three
months and a fresh crisis, the Delhi government finally amended the Master Plan
in September, declaring large areas that already had massive commercial presence
but were still designated 'residential' instead of 'commercial'. The amended plan
also declared that some residential colonies could have commercial establishments
in their midst. Colonies, as residential neighbourhoods in Delhi are called, were
categorized from A to G by size of residential plots and density of population (both
being indicators of 'posh'ness, an English word that has successfully been adopted
into Delhi Hindi). Except for 'A' and 'B' areas, where zoning was to be strictly
enforced, with minor exceptions allowed only if the local RWAs agreed, the other
categories were granted a reprieve. The government also issued two notifications
in September 2006, clearing 2,183 roads for mixed land use, commercial stretches
and pedestrian shopping streets in the C, D, E, F, G and H categories of colonies
across the capital. As the sealing continued, a '_Bandh_' against the sealing campaign
called by the Confederation of All India Traders on 20 September 2006 led to
violence and five people died in police firing in Seelampur, one of the poorest
parts of East Delhi.[^3/66] These actions by the government as well as the protests
were of course immediately condemned by the media, the RWAs and the court as
unseemly vote bank politics.

With the conflict heating up, the Court on 29 September 2006 criticized
the government for these notifications, calling them 'ad hoc measures' and orally
observed that 'the last minute notifications are causing utter confusion and
chaos to the citizens ... An impression is given as if judiciary is on one side and
government on the other side.' It continued to insist that at least the 40,000-odd
people who had filed affidavits that they would stop misuse would still have to
comply with it or have their shops sealed to protect 'the dignity and authority
of the Court'. The court allowed them time till 31 October 2006 on account of
the festival of Diwali. With regard to the others saved by the new September
notifications, the court required fresh undertakings to be filed by all before the
Monitoring Committee by 10 November 2006 (later extended to 31 January 2007)
that misuse would be stopped as per the court directions if the law was
invalidated and/or the notifications quashed. It also declared that sealing would
continue vis-√†-vis others not covered by the notifications. The court restrained the
government from issuing any other notification for conversion of residential use
into commercial use except with the leave of the court.

With the deadline of 31 October approaching and another _bandh_ call given
by the traders at the perceived discrimination against the 40,000 traders who had
given undertakings, the MCD and the government again approached the court.
This time they were armed with a survey which said that 25,000 out of these
40,000 odd would be covered by the September mixed land use notifications. The
court finally recognized the anomaly in insisting on action against the people who
had filed affidavits in time, while others who had not filed would get away, and
temporarily barred action against them. But after the experience of these shops
whose shopkeepers had filed affidavits, the others covered by the new notifications
were also now required to file fresh undertakings. They would be subject to the
court's final decision on the legality of the notifications by 31 January 2007. They,
now, hesitated to file any affidavits because they did not want to be in a similar
boat in the future. As sealing could theoretically resume against all of them, the
government deployed its final weapon on 7 February 2007. It notified a New
Master Plan for Delhi, which incorporated the recent mixed-use notifications and
relaxed many of the zoning norms.

***

The new plan --- MPD 2021 --- was declared an 'Anti-Plan plan' by the
newspapers and was immediately challenged as invalid in the Supreme Court
by the RWAs. The court reacted in a manner similar to its response to the prior
amendments, and soon declared that it would examine the constitutionality of the
Plan. It also made actions taken as per the new Plan norms subject to the court's
final decision on its constitutionality. For instance, the Plan, for the first time,
allowed a third floor to be constructed in a residential building. Initially the court
barred the MCD from giving any permission for construction of a third floor in
residential areas under this provision, but a year later (by an order in March 2008),
the court allowed it, subject to an undertaking given by the home owners that they
would abide by its final decision on the validity of MPD-2021. An MCD official
explained the standard practice that had evolved on this issue after this order: 'The
court had said neither the owner nor the person to whom the property would be
sold or transferred could claim equity, if the verdict goes against them. We just
take an affidavit from the owner stating this.' The MCD had already sanctioned
almost 25,000 building plans for the third floor by 2011.[^3/67] By 2013, this number
was estimated to be many times larger.

The _writ petition_ challenging the 2007 Master Plan that arose in this case
and was heard along with it is still pending in court, and hundreds of thousands
of people own and/or live in third floor residential units throughout the city. But
permission to construct it is given subject to the court decision and if the court
decides against the New Master Plan norms, these would be declared illegal and
subject to demolition --- a kind of Damocles' sword hanging over people in Delhi
due to this case. Meanwhile, the drama of sealing and de-sealing continued off
and on even after the MPD-2021 came into force, though with relatively fewer
protagonists and lower stakes. After 2009, in particular since the retirement of
Justice Arijit Pasayat, who headed this bench after Justice Sabharwal's retirement,
hardly any effective hearing took place in this case.[^3/68] The case had become
impossibly unwieldy with hundreds of IAs pending, mostly for de-sealing of
specific premises already sealed. For a bench hearing this case for the first time, it
was a herculean task to get a handle on the sheer bulk of the files in this case. The
cause list of this case alone, listing all the pending matters, would itself run into
dozens of pages. By 2013, as many as 900 IAs connected to this case were still
pending. Also pending were the _writ petitions_ challenging the constitutionality
of provisions of the Master Plan 2021, the Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act,
which had been renewed every year and the DDA notifications allowing mixed
land use. The court had had enough of it by then, and on 30 April 2013, the sealing
case was divided into two parts and remanded to the lower judiciary. The IAs
dealing with factual questions requesting for de-sealing were sent to the appellate
tribunals of the respective Municipal Authorities in Delhi, and the _writ petitions_
dealing with the more legal questions were referred to the Delhi High Court.
The court had belatedly realized its own limitations in dealing with issues of
such complexity and amplitude. Meanwhile, the Delhi Laws (Special Provisions)
continue to be extended periodically and are still in force in 2016.

## Conclusion

One of the reasons for the court easing off on sealing was the retirement in January
2007 of Chief Justice Y. K. Sabharwal, who had presided over the sealing matter
from the beginning. In fact, he had initiated this matter by his order in 2005
and moved the focus decisively from relocation of 'non-conforming industries' to
commercial 'misuse' of residential properties. On his retirement, he confessed that
the '_sealing case_' in the capital was the most difficult one of his career. He said that
he had to earn the wrath of his friends and relatives on the issue:

>My friends and relatives even stopped talking to me. Yesterday one of my
relatives \[affected by the sealing order\] told me sarcastically that I am a big
man. I told him I cannot solve individual problems. The problem is because
of corruption in the system and flaws in the Master Plan.[^3/69]

Perhaps the uniqueness of the _sealing case_ in Delhi's long history of PIL is
not only the amazing alacrity and avidity with which the government and MCD
fought the long-drawn out chess battle with the court, with one move following
another, but also that the potential losers in this case could include the 'friends
and relatives' of a Supreme Court judge, not something that could be said by the
thousands made jobless by the relocation of industries in the same case or indeed,
about the slum-dwellers who were made homeless by the PIL courts' intervention
in the 2000s.

As Justice Sabharwal phrased his dilemma: 'The issue of sealing was difficult,
as on the one hand it was a question of law and on the other it was the sufferings of
people.' For once, at least, the judge was in a position to encounter (and potentially
understand) the 'sufferings of people' caused by his PIL orders, unlike in the many
other instances of people who lost their livelihoods because of the orders in this
very case. The auto rickshaw drivers were easy sacrificial lambs for the cause of
environment --- unlike, say, diesel car manufacturers. Owners of large factories
wanting to close sunset industries and convert them into profitable real estate
were given a break by the court, while the labour working in the same factories
paid a heavy price. Smaller factory owners had less space to manoeuvre in court,
but a section of them managed to pull their political weight eventually. But the
hundreds of thousands of traders and 'mom and pop shop' owners of Delhi were
an immeasurably more powerful constituency, for political society and eventually,
even for the court.

Perhaps this is why the sealing matter had a much stormier career in court ---
lasting for a whole year, and allowing the court at best a pyrrhic victory. It is not a
story we encounter very often with PIL, but the exception is of interest precisely
for that reason --- When can people manoeuvre around an all-powerful PIL court
and when can they not.

***

The most unsavoury aspect of the _sealing case_ came to light four months after
Justice Sabharwal's retirement --- causing what writer Arundhati Roy then called a
'scandal in the palace'.[^3/70] In May 2007, the tabloid _Mid-day_ published a news item
pointing out that just when Justice Sabharwal was kick-starting the '_sealing case_'
by turning the long-running PIL about relocation of industries into a case about
misuse of commercial properties, his sons were entering into partnership with two
major mall and commercial complex developers, resulting at the very least in a
'conflict of interest' as their father led a judicial campaign that indirectly benefited
them. Suddenly, the repressed aspect of the _sealing case_ was out in the open: that
it was about mall owners versus shopkeepers. Closing down shops would create a
demand for mall space. The sealing campaign had further limited the availability
of commercial space for shops, and as Roy put it, 'The better-off amongst those
whose shops and offices had been sealed queued up for space in these malls.
Prices shot up. The mall business boomed, it was the newest game in town.' And
ironically, the judge who initiated and presided over the sealing campaign against
commercial use of residential property, himself simultaneously allowed his sons
to use his private as well as official residence for commercial purposes, that too
as their firm's registered office! Meanwhile, instead of starting any inquiry against
Justice Sabharwal, the whistle-blower journalists of _Mid-day_ were sentenced to
four months' imprisonment for contempt of court, in a hurriedly decided _suo motu_
case[^3/71] initiated by the Delhi High Court.

Even if the charges of corruption against Justice Sabharwal are unproven
and it was perhaps 'a borderline case',[^3/72] the remarkable fact is that a jurisdiction
like PIL enabled a judge to wilfully initiate a roving inquiry into a complex issue
like zoning that affected millions. He could then decide on the path to be taken
and force its implementation at a citywide level with supervision by his own
chosen officials, with his own handpicked lawyer deciding the direction of the
case and without necessarily hearing the parties affected by his decisions. In such
a system, petty corruption is at the very least an occupational hazard. Ideological
predilection leading a judge in such a direction is scarcely less dangerous.

Such an ideological slant in favour of corporate capital was clearly enunciated
in a judgment made by the Supreme Court around the same time when it was
leading the campaign against the toleration of illegalities in 'the _sealing case_'. On 17 October 2006, the court delivered its verdict on one of the most conspicuous
cases of elite illegality in Delhi. The cause of the controversy was the construction
of a huge complex of three 'world-class' shopping malls, intended to be the most
exclusive in India. The location of these malls was to be the South Delhi ridge,
hitherto designated a forest area, and with a history of acute water scarcity in the
residential neighbourhoods in the vicinity. A PIL had been filed against the malls
by concerned citizens of the area. No environmental clearance had been obtained.
An 'expert committee' appointed by the court found blatant illegalities and noted
that 'the location of large commercial complexes in this area was environmentally
unsound'. But with substantial construction already completed, the committee
recommended 'a compromise with _de facto_ situation'. The environmentalist
petitioners protested against such post-facto regularization and cited various
decisions of the court where it had 'taken serious view of unauthorized construction'.

The court brushed aside all objections, having decided already that it was
'satisfied about the _bona fides_' of the mall developers. What the bench did here
was to clearly specify its double standards:

>The stand that wherever constructions have been made unauthorisedly
demolition is the only option cannot apply to the present cases, more
particularly, when they unlike (_sic_), where some private individuals or private
limited companies or firms being allotted to have made contraventions, are
corporate bodies and institutions and _the question of their having indulged in any
malpractices in getting the approval or sanction does not arise_.[^3/73] (Emphasis mine)

Just 18 days before the above verdict, the Supreme Court had passed the
following judgment in 4677/1985 at the height of its exasperation in the sealing
case:

>The city of Delhi is an example of a classical case, which, for the last number
of years, has been a witness of flagrant violations of municipal laws, town
planning laws and norms, Master Plan and environmental laws. It is borne
out from various orders and judgments passed by this Court and the Delhi
High Court, whether in a case of shifting of hazardous and polluting
industries or providing cleaner fuel (CNG) or encroachment of public land
and streets or massive unauthorized construction and misuse of properties. It
is a common knowledge that these illegal activities are also one of the main
sources of corruption.

Through PIL, the appellate judges of Delhi launched a fierce drive to undo
illegality and corruption in the municipal regulation of land use of Delhi, of which
WP 4677/1985 is the definitive example. However, some of the most flagrant of
such violations were the massive building complexes built clearly in violation of
municipal norms --- Akshardham Temple and Commonwealth Games Village on
the Yamuna River Bed, Sainik Farms --- the largest unauthorized colony in Delhi
and of course, the Vasant Kunj malls. High profile PILs had been filed against all
of these conspicuously illegal developments and these were all heard in the same
decade that saw so much judicial action against illegally built structures all over
the city. However, in each of these cases of egregious violations of municipal laws,
the court rationalized their existence and refrained from intervening. All of these
buildings survive unscathed. The wrath of PIL was clearly a selective one.

provided auto rickshaw owners 'who have placed firm orders for new CNG vehicles
or for conversion to CNG mode' 'give details on affidavits by 31^st^ March, 2001 about
their existing vehicles, as also details of the orders placed by them for new CNG
vehicles or for conversion to CNG mode.' The difficulties in this process of getting an
official document to prove that such an order has been placed is discussed in Faruqui
and Sud, Auto-rickshaws in Delhi. This caused a situation where tens of thousands of
auto rickshaw-owners had to file the requisite affidavits in the Supreme Court in five
days' time, leading to an unprecedented situation in the Supreme Court registry. As a
result of this melee and the confusion caused by the conversion process, the number of
autorickshaw permits in Delhi declined from 83,000 to 50,000 in 2002.
