# Conclusion: The Procedural is Political

In Max Weber's classic exposition of modern law in 'Economy and Society',
he describes the need for a logically formal rational legal system to exist in
tandem with the rise of capitalism. This model of modern law is that of a
society dominated by an autonomous rule system, or 'legalism', as legal sociologist
David Trubek calls it. A legalistic society in this sense is of course an ideal type,
and so is its Weberian opposite: kadijustiz. As Weber's translator Max Rheinstein
explains it, the term _kadijustiz_ was used by Weber as 'a term of art to describe the
administration of justice which is oriented not at fixed rules of a formally rational
law but at the ethical, religious, political, or otherwise expediential postulates of a
substantively rational law.'[^6/1]

The legal history of post-Emergency India shows a remarkable opposition to
legalism and a concomitant embrace of '_kadijustiz_' at all levels of the judiciary --- or,
as Dr Rajeev Dhavan has called its Indian analogue, '_panchayati justice_'. Being
'legalistic' has decisively emerged as a negative attribute for judicial performance
in post-Emergency India. In this book, I have focused on the rise of this culture
of legal informalism at the highest levels of the Indian judiciary and its impact,
through an examination of PIL. But the institutional impact of such legal
informalism is not limited to the PIL jurisdiction alone. It has infected every part
of the legal system.

One of the most spectacular instances of '_panchayati justice_' in recent years,
which finally led to some critical debate on this phenomenon, was the verdict given
by the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court in September 2010, in what
is perhaps the most controversial legal case in contemporary India: the civil suit
to decide the Ram Janmabhoomi--Babri Mosque dispute. The legal dispute was
to settle title to the disputed property between three principal parties: the Hindu
idol 'Shri Ram Lalla Virajman', another Hindu religious organization 'Nirmohi
Akhara', and the Sunni Central Wakf Board. As a private property dispute filed
in a civil court, such a case is governed by strict rules of procedure, and the court
can only give forms of relief that are legally prayed for. However, the verdict given,
after the suit had been pending for decades, was to divide the property equally
among all three parties. What was especially strange was that the court dismissed
the Wakf Board's suit as time barred for having been filed after the limitation
period had expired, but still went on to award it relief. Particularly insidious was
the looseness with which the judgment referred to the parties by their religion.
But, for our purposes, what is of interest is the debate this verdict led to.

For once, '_panchayati justice_' emerged as a term of criticism in India public
discourse. Eminent _senior advocate_ P. P. Rao said about the judgment:

>It is difficult to appreciate how the property can be divided by the court while
dismissing the suits. This is nothing but a _panchayati_ type of justice. If the
court accepts that the Waqf Board is entitled to one-third of the land, it can't
dismiss the suit. If the court dismisses the suits, it can't give only a portion of
the land. The court has gone beyond the prayers in the suits. When no one
had asked for division of the land, how can the court divide the land into
three portions?[^6/2]

Dhavan weighed in:

>Never in legal history has a title suit been converted into a partition suit in
this way ... This is _panchayati justice_ which takes away the legal rights of
Muslims and converts the moral sentimental entitlements of Hindus into
legal rights.[^6/3]

Retired Chief Justice of India, A. H. Ahmadi said

>I am not sure on what basis the Sunni Waqf suit has been timebarred. But if
the title is not theirs, how can one-third be a _masjid_ now, and if the title is
theirs, how can two-thirds be divided? There certainly can be a compromise
but that should have happened after the verdict. The verdict should not
appear like a decision of a _panchayat_ foisted forcibly on all parties.[^6/4]

The contrary view, celebrating the judgment, showed its impatience with
technicalities. I quote here three powerful _senior advocates_ of the Supreme Court.
Harish Salve said, 'It has used the judicial discretion available to a court. There is no
legal principle preventing judges to exercise statesmanship as long as it is within the
framework of the law.'[^6/5] K. K. Venugopal declared, 'It is a statesmanship-like judgment
and it is good for the country.'[^6/6] And Mukul Rohatgi offered the following comment:

>I think it is a political kind of solution. It has given something to everybody.
This seems to be the just possible solution in respecting the sentiments of all
parties. We should be progressive on these issues and accept the judgment.[^6/7]

Opinions on either side could be neatly contrasted. The former view could
be seen as narrowly legalistic, critical of the court for overreaching itself, while
the latter strand of opinion appreciates the court's political statesmanship, even
if extra-legal, against the background of the need for communal peace. The latter
argument might be summed in aphoristic terms as --- it might be bad law, but
it's good politics. Such teleological reasoning carries the day in post-Emergency
Indian legal culture. The underlying assumption behind such an approach seems to
be that the political is purely external to law, not immanent within it. The votaries
of _panchayati justice_ seem to believe that there is no political content to the legal
form itself, that it can be evaluated purely by the decision it leads to. The normative
basis of this legal form and the sedimented history it contains within itself is
rarely paid any attention in such an analysis. But is it a valid assumption that
this history has no political content which might need to be preserved, or at least
dealt with less flippantly? Is there no way to understand law except on the basis
of criteria external to it? Is the only way to evaluate legal developments in terms
of their consequences? Does the utter collapse of court procedure --- the systematic
exclusion of necessary parties to a certain dispute, for instance --- not affect the
political evaluation of the decision arrived by such a 'court'? The _consequentalism
vs deontology_ binary might not be the most useful way to think about these
questions. But I would argue that there is, at the very least, a need to think in terms
of institutional consequences rather than narrow immediate results. An attempt
has been made in this book to assess the enduring political repercussions of what
I have argued has been a reckless overhauling of Indian legal institutions in the
last few decades.

India since the 1970s has seen a general trend towards informalization in
many areas of law. The apotheosis of legal informalism or _panchayati justice_ in
post-Emergency India has been achieved in spite of the fact that the biggest legal
scandal of this period, the Bhopal settlement, was an astonishing example of judicial
bad faith passing for _panchayati justice_. Then too, let us not forget, the Supreme
Court said, 'Legal and procedural technicalities should yield to the paramount
considerations of justice and humanity.' What came in the way of imposing legal
liability in Bhopal, the court argued, was the suffering of the people. Upendra
Baxi wrote in mourning after the settlement that it was if the poisonous methyl
Isocyanate gas 'had entered the soul of Indian jurisprudence'.[^6/8] Unfortunately, this
'Indian jurisprudence' survived the poison and lived on in an ever more mutant
form. The lessons of Bhopal were not learnt. Let us not forget the principal perfidy
of the Bhopal settlement. The victims were not even consulted before the court
pronounced on their fate. They were considered 'irresponsible and uninformed'[^6/9]
and therefore given a _fait accompli_. Their grievance had been expropriated, first,
by the Indian government and, then, by the Indian Supreme Court, which twice
justified the settlement as if it could speak on behalf of the suffering victims. That
such a court would soon get rid of the petitioner in PIL cases and arrogate powers
as victim and adjudicator to itself can hardly be surprising. Veena Das ends her
essay on Bhopal with a quote from Lyotard:

>It is in the nature of a victim not to be able to prove that one has been done
a wrong. A plaintiff is someone who has incurred damages and who disposes
of the means to prove it. One becomes a victim if one loses these means.[^6/10]

PIL has become a giant machine to turn people who could be plaintiffs into
victims.

The turn away from legality to _panchayati justice_ is manifest in other spheres
too. A classic example would be the Family Courts legally instituted in 1984 'with
a view to promote conciliation in, and secure speedy settlement of disputes related
to marriage and family affairs.'[^6/11] The aim was to move away from the adversarial
process towards mediation and conciliation. Such conciliation was interpreted as
an impetus to reconciliation as the statute expected the judges to endeavour to
preserve the 'institution of marriage and to promote the welfare of children'.[^6/12]
Anthropologist Srimati Basu sums up the result:

>Litigants are subjected to judges' directions and are expected to be best
represented through the judge's mediation rather than their own. In fact, it
could be argued that this format has vastly increased judges' unilateral powers
in exchange for lawyers' and has fewer checks and balances.[^6/13]

When the '_lok adalat_' (literally 'people's court'), a kind of informal court for
small causes, was first introduced nationally in 1987, it was to be 'guided by the
principles of justice, equity, fair play and other _legal principles_'.[^6/14] But even this
vague phrase was seen as too rigid and an amendment in 2002 introduced the
'permanent _lok adalat_', which was to be 'guided by the principles of natural justice,
objectivity, fair play, equity and other principles of justice, and shall not be bound
by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.'[^6/15] As
Galanter and Krishnan argue:

>The shift of decisional standards from 'legal principles' to 'principles of justice'
suggests a major enlargement of the presiding judge's discretion and a robust
faith that the poor have more to gain from benign paternalism than from
juristic or popular legality.[^6/16]

The romance of indigenous justice that started enjoying currency in India
since the Emergency era ideological attack on Anglo--Saxon legal institutions was
later overlaid with the global cool of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in
the post-liberalization era. Indian legal informalism continues to enjoy enormous
ideological appeal, partly based on claims of autochthony, partly due to pragmatic
considerations and more recently because it comes dressed up in the sleek global
garb of ADR, making it seem 'cutting edge.'

Galanter and Krishnan record that when they presented their critical
hypothesis on '_lok adalats_' (they titled their paper 'debased informalism') to
an audience of High Court and Supreme Court judges, they were accused of
seeing things through a Western, even colonial lens. The judges' rather impatient
response was to say that irrespective of how perfunctory such justice might be,
_lok adalats_ do improve the overall legal system: 'To ignore their contributions
is to misunderstand ... how justice functions in India'. Such an argument, that
'Indian conditions' require informalism, has been the basis of the valorization and
justification of PIL right from its inception.

This normativization of substantive justice for Indian conditions has been
advocated by Partha Chatterjee as well in his recent work on political society.
Chatterjee asks, 'Is justice better served by the non-arbitrary procedures of the
equal application of the law, or by the contextual and possibly arbitrary judgment
that addresses the peculiarities of a particular case?'[^6/17] This monograph is partly a
response to that question, and an attempt to address, however partially, the related
academic lack that Chatterjee underlines when he points out that 'the continuing
social legitimacy of arbitrary power is an important and under-researched aspect
of the practices of Indian democracy.'

So who decides what serves justice better? Chatterjee's own answer to
this question is subtle but clear enough, 'Political society in India ... affords
the possibility of inviting the arbitrary power of government to mitigate the
potentially tyrannical power of the law.'[^6/18] He goes on to approvingly cite two
historical accounts from colonial Bengal that criticized the British regime of non-arbitrary
rule of law and argued that 'direct access to an impartial judge who was
knowledgeable about and sensitive to the specific circumstances of a case was far
more likely to serve the cause of justice'.[^6/19] Chatterjee argues that this 'critique
has continued to inform popular beliefs and practices about the judicial system of
modern India.'[^6/20]

According to Chatterjee, there are at least two discourses this 'widely shared
popular critique of the modern normative idea of the non-arbitrary and equal
application of the law' can draw its roots from. One should keep in mind that
Chatterjee's project here is to lay out the colonial genealogy of an endemic
tendency in modern political theory to diagnose an empirical deviation from the
norm, and then carve out an exception to the norm itself. This tendency itself
keeps evolving as we move from colonial to postcolonial regimes of power. While
the first 'symmetrical' response of political theory since Bentham was of:

>Many conservative colonial officials of British India, that the impersonal
procedures of rational law and bureaucracy were unsuited to backward
societies used to customary rather than contractual obligations and that the
exercise of personal but impartial authority was more appropriate.

This would lead to the declaration of a colonial exception. On the other hand,
with the more contemporary 'sequential' approach of 'multiple modernities':

>We might be moved to suggest not the irrelevance of the norm of the
impersonal and non-arbitrary application of the law but its critical re-evaluation
in the light of emergent practices in many postcolonial countries
that seek to punctuate or supplement it by appealing to the personal and
contextual circumstances.

From this, Chatterjee goes on to speculate:

>That the enormous powers of judicial review of legislation and active
surveillance of executive acts assumed by the Indian law courts --- powers
unknown in any other liberal constitutional system in the world --- is a
response to this popular critique of procedural non-arbitrariness.

Chatterjee's project includes an attempt:

>To redefine the normative standards of modern politics in the light of the
considerable accumulation of new practices that may at present be described
only in the language of exceptions but in fact contain the core of a richer,
more diverse and inclusive, set of norms.[^6/21]

In other words, 'emergent practices' or 'improvizations' are to lead to redefined
norms --- underlying this, I worry, is an attempt to derive an ought from an is.
Chatterjee's confidence that such a new kind of Indian exceptionalism is somehow
different from the 'colonial exception' seems to me difficult to sustain. The difference
between these two colonial and postcolonial logics of carving out an exception to
the global norm is not as stark as Chatterjee argues: the two do bleed into each
other, in their common culturalist justification, for example.

Chatterjee's examples of such practices are in the realm of political society,
where governmental authorities like municipal officials or the police carve out
exceptions for marginal populations to inhabit spaces illegally or to get access to
government largesse, in such a way that these temporary arrangements do not
disturb the rule of law. The problem is that his argument moves from this world
of administration to the world of law. To reiterate, Chatterjee argues that 'political
society, operating under conditions of electoral democracy in India, affords the
possibility of inviting the arbitrary power of government to mitigate the potentially
tyrannical power of the law.' The reverse, too, can happen once his argument is
carried through to law: the possibility now arises of inviting the arbitrary power
of law to mitigate the potentially tyrannical power of the government. And this
is exactly what PIL does, as we saw in Chapters 2 and 3. It invokes the arbitrary
new populist powers of the law courts to mitigate the populist powers of political
society. PIL might have arisen as a populist partner to Mrs Gandhi's politics, but
the huge powers such populism lent it have enabled it to emerge as a bulwark
against political society in the twenty-first century. It is important perhaps to keep
in mind the specificity of this new mutant beast of judicial populism, which works
very differently from any democratic theory of judicial review and is profoundly
antagonistic to the populism of political society.

Chatterjee has written elsewhere that 'populism is the only morally legitimate
form of democratic politics today. ... present day critics of populism must, to make
their case, necessarily demand the restriction or modification of democracy.'[^6/22]
In the last decade or so, the Indian appellate judiciary has emerged as the most
powerful institutional critic of the practices of populism in Indian politics.
Concomitantly, it has also spearheaded, as Chatterjee and Katznelson have called
it, a 'counter-democratic' tendency, 'justified by the alleged failures of the system
of electoral representation to provide good government, caused, it is said, by the
surrender of politicians to short-sighted populism.'[^6/23]

One might be unsurprised by this and argue that after all is it not judiciary's
constitutional function to be distrustful of the government. It is important to
clarify, therefore, that the judicial function in a constitutional republic is not
necessarily counter-democratic. On the contrary, John Hart Ely has provided a
highly influential theory of constitutional adjudication, according to which the
courts' role is precisely meant to preserve and reinforce democracy.

It is worthwhile to discuss in some detail what such a judicial function would
entail, according to Ely. Judicial review, he says, is required to respond to systemic
malfunctioning of the government. However, such a malfunction cannot be
alleged just because it generates outcomes that the judiciary disagrees with. Thus,
the 'quality of governance' cannot be such a ground.[^6/24] Such a malfunction can
only be said to occur when the democratic process is undeserving of trust. These
are situations when the process of political representation itself is not working, to
rectify which, the judiciary should perform a 'representation reinforcing' role, as
Ely calls it. He identifies two broad situations when the process of representation
can be said to require stringent judicial review: first, when the government in
power 'clogs off the channels of political change to ensure that they will stay
in'; and second, when a minority is being denied the protection afforded by a
representative system and the government is acting as an accessory to majority
tyranny. Ely gives three areas in which the first situation comes into play and
where the courts should be heavily involved in 'clearing the channels of political
change':

(1) When the rights to free speech, publication and political association
are violated, which are all 'critical to the functioning of an open and effective
democratic process'.[^6/25]

(2) When the right to vote is undermined.

(3) When there
is excessive delegation of the legislative function to unelected administrators.

Interestingly, these three areas where the courts can play a crucial role in
protecting democratic institutions are precisely where the Indian appellate
judiciary has been remarkably timid.[^6/26] As Pratap Bhanu Mehta evaluated the
courts' role in restoring integrity to the democratic process:

>A student of the Indian scene need only recall the judiciary's 'no show' during
the state of emergency and hands-off approach to preventive detention since
then. Less dramatically but still seriously, the courts in ruling after ruling
have been diluting the impact of two democratizing amendments (numbers 73 and 74) by insisting that unelected bureaucrats have more power than
local elected officials.[^6/27]

Ely's analysis of the second situation of systematic malfunctioning,
according to which 'discrete and insular minorities' are entitled to 'heightened
judicial solicitude' has been so widely accepted that the judiciary is increasingly
viewed as a counter-majoritarian institution. On this issue, however, the Indian
Supreme Court recently provided a most egregious example of abdication of any
such responsibility. In the infamous judgment of _Suresh Kumar Koushal vs. Naz
Foundation_, by which the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of Sec. 377 of the Indian Penal code criminalising sexual intercourse 'against the order
of nature,', the court derisively described the LGBT community as 'a miniscule
fraction of the country's population'. That the supposedly small number of any
community should at all be a negative factor in the court's determination of their
rights shows how far the Indian appellate judiciary is from performing its classic
institutional role in a democratic polity. The important aspect to note here is
that such shocking judicial rhetoric is completely consistent with the court's
post-emergency populist avatar, as legal scholar Tarunabh Khaitan has suggested.
He argues that for such a court, its legitimacy no longer rests on constitutional
mandate. 'Unsurprisingly, standing up for unpopular minorities becomes a
very difficult task for such an institution,' he suggests.'[^6/28] Indeed, its judgment
upholding Sec. 377 is in continuum with its consistently cavalier approach to civil
liberties throughout the post-emergency period which saw the rise of PIL. It has
been a longstanding trend as the Indian Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld a
whole alphabet soup of repressive statutes which violate basic civil and political
rights. For a populist judiciary, a counter-democratic role comes much more
naturally than its classic democratic function of reinforcing representation.

The larger question, however, that we are left with is this: can there be any
normative critique possible of the Indian political present, without succumbing to
a negative comparison with a global norm? Should we valorize the present and in
fact deem it normative, just because the new forms of postcolonial politics depart
from the global norm? Do the 'emergent practices' have to be celebrated just
because they are different and happening in India? Postcolonial political theory
has to have a critical relationship with postcolonial political practice. What the
language of such critique should be, is a difficult question. It certainly cannot be
the lack of its approximation to a global norm. For instance, it would be churlish
to criticize the Indian Supreme Court simply based on an adverse comparison
with the US Supreme Court. But I would be wary of the contrary tendency to
impart normativity to the practice and popularity of PIL, for example, just because
it departs from Anglo--Saxon jurisprudence. As Michel Foucault argued, popular
justice, once reified into a court-like institution, becomes its deformation.[^6/29]
