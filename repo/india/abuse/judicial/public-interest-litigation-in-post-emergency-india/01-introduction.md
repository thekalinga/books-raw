# Introduction

In recent years, 'PIL' has made an appearance in many a Hindi film. Two examples
come to mind. In the somewhat ungrammatically titled _Sahib, Biwi aur Gangster
Returns_, the mention of PIL comes when a state legislator --- the eponymous
_Biwi_, whose official position has come to her by dint of being married to a small-time
prince in the North Indian state of Uttar Pradesh --- decides to take some interest
in what's going on in her constituency. The first important piece of information her
office assistant provides her with is that a PIL has been filed against land acquisition
for a development project in her area. Her baffled response is, '_Yeh PIL kya hota
hai?_' ('What is PIL?') She is clearly ill-informed. But that the film chooses to invoke
PIL to show her complete political cluelessness, and that the astounding nature of
this fact will be immediately apparent to the audience watching popular cinema, the
lowest common denominator in India if there is one, gives us some clue perhaps to
the omnipresence of PIL in contemporary Indian life. The second film, a satirical
comedy called _Jolly LLB_, is much more directly concerned with the operation of
the judiciary. It centres around a small-town lawyer who is trying to make it big in
Delhi's law courts and decides that filing a PIL might be the quickest way to get
media attention. In a scene that made it into the film's promotional trailer, a judge
is shown angrily throwing away Jolly's legal brief, saying, 'What kind of PIL have
you filed? You have spelt Prosecution as Prostitution and appeal as apple!' Clearly,
PIL is one kind of legal process everybody understands. As much as 'appeal' and
'prosecution', it has entered the Indian demotic lexicon.

So widespread is its reach that PIL has become a sort of metonym for the
greatness of the Indian judiciary. No area of Indian law has been written about as
extensively (and almost entirely hagiographically) as PIL. There are more American
law review articles on PIL than on any other area of Indian law. Indeed, Indian
judges routinely cite these approving articles to hail their own achievements. PIL
has by now been successfully transplanted in other neighbouring South Asian
countries as well.[^1/1] PIL is celebrated by all and sundry as India's unique contribution
to contemporary jurisprudence. Lest it appear that I subscribe to this culturalist
understanding linking PIL to its Indian-ness, I hope it will soon be apparent that
my aim is precisely to question such a move. The remarkable thing, as we will see,
is that such a self-consciously culturalist manoeuvre was exactly what enabled and
accompanied the rise of PIL.

This book will study the history and politics of Public Interest Litigation, or
PIL as it is popularly known, a jurisdiction unique to the Indian higher judiciary
that arose in the late 1970s in the aftermath of the political emergency of 1975--77.
It has been hailed as the most dramatic democratizing move that the Indian
judiciary had made in the post-independence period. For example, according
to legal scholar Usha Ramanathan, PIL led to an explosive 'jurisprudence of
constitutional relevance and the rejection of redundancy of peoples'.[^1/2] She argues
that it enabled the court to extend a unique invitation to journalists, activists,
academics and anyone else who may be a witness to constitutional neglect and
lawlessness to participate in the judicial process.

A PIL is pursued by filing a  _writ petition_ either in one of the various State High
Courts or the Supreme Court. This avenue was already available under the Indian
Constitution but PIL makes recourse to it significantly easier. PIL is primarily a
revolution in procedure, and its innovative features that emerged in its early years
have been usefully summarised by a commentator Wouter Vandenhole:

a. The rules of _locus standi_ were relaxed.
b. The formal requirements regarding the lodging of a petition were
simplified.
c. Evidence could be gathered by a commission appointed by the court.
d. The procedure adopted was claimed not to be of an adversarial nature.
e. The court could order far-reaching remedial measures.
f. The execution of the remedial orders was supervised and followed up.

As Vandenhole summed them up: 'The first two innovations concern the start
of the procedure, the next two have to do with its course, and the last two with its
outcome.'[^1/3]

Legal scholar Lavanya Rajamani explains the effect of these innovations:

>The power of public interest litigation (PIL) in India lies in its freedom
from the constraints of traditional judicial proceedings. PILs in India have
come to be characterized by a collaborative approach, procedural flexibility,
judicially supervised interim orders and forward-looking relief. Judges in
their activist avatar reach out to numerous parties and stake-holders, form
fact-finding, monitoring or policy-evolution committees, and arrive at
constructive solutions to the problems flagged for their attention by public-spirited
citizens. Judges have tremendous power, in particular in PILs, to
design innovative solutions, direct policy changes, catalyse law-making,
reprimand officials and enforce orders. And, they are not hesitant to exercise
this power in what they perceive as the public interest. Where there is a
perceived 'vacuum in governance, the Court rushes to fill it'.[^1/4]

In order to begin to make sense of such celebratory clamour, a brief
introduction to the structure of the Indian judicial system is necessary. Robert
Moog, an eminent sociologist of Indian law, provides this useful summary:

>India's judiciary is a three-tiered, integrated system. The Supreme Court,
which sits in New Delhi, is the only all-India forum. High Courts stand at
the head of the judiciary in each state. These are the intermediate appellate
courts in the system, but they also have _writ jurisdiction_. The third tier is
the district-level courts. Despite India's federal system of government, the
court system is integrated in the sense that there is no bifurcation between
state and federal judiciaries. These three tiers form a single hierarchy and
administer both state and federal laws.[^1/5]

It is important to keep in mind that the heroic persona of the Indian judiciary ---
made possible by PIL --- is reserved only for the State High Courts and the
Supreme Court. Indeed, thanks to PIL, the higher judiciary is often viewed as the
panacea for the various endemic social and political problems that plague India.
The lower judiciary, the system of civil and criminal courts at the district level,
on the other hand, is perceived as purely pathological --- inefficient, corrupt and
overly embedded in the Indian social milieu --- while the appellate courts of course
apparently transcend it. A remarkable paradox about studying India's judiciary is
the simultaneously held diametrically opposite view of the two wings of the same
integrated system. This schizophrenia has been sustained for a long time and is
only getting worse. One clue to the management of such an unsullied image by the
higher judiciary, in the face of the impression of such extreme pathology below it,
is the distancing tactic that the members of the higher judiciary have perfected: to
intermittently express despair at the condition of the lower courts. Robert Moog
gives a good example of this when he quotes a Supreme Court judge declaring
from the bench in 1995, 'It is common knowledge that currently in our country
criminal courts excel in slow motion.'[^1/6] The higher judiciary has successfully evaded
any responsibility for the problems of the lower judiciary, although strictly speaking,
they have direct vertical oversight over the latter.

Moog has analyzed such appellate treatment of lower courts in India in some
detail. One effect of such despair is a constant 'search for alternatives, which range
from versions of the more traditional _panchayats_ (village or caste), such state-run
forums as _lok adalats_ (people's courts) or the widening array of tribunals ...'[^1/7] Another
result of this skewed judicial system is, as Moog demonstrates, 'an increased flow
of cases to High Courts and the Supreme Court in the form of appeals, revisions,
reviews, or the use of the upper courts' _writ jurisdiction_ to avoid the district courts
entirely.'[^1/8] Thanks particularly to the proliferation of _writ petitions_ as convenient
shortcuts to the High Court, the judicial system has gradually become so top
heavy that by the early 1990s, Moog estimated that 'the High Court has become
the single most active trial court in the state of Kerala'. Article 226 of the Indian
Constitution empowers the High Courts to issue _writs_ for the enforcement of
Fundamental Rights and for any other purpose, allowing its use against a breach
of any legal right by the state. The Supreme Court has an analogous provision
under Article 32, enabling _writ petitions_ to be filed directly before it. Such relative
ease of access to the higher judiciary, Moog has argued, has further undermined:

>the public's perception of the quality of justice they receive from the
subordinate courts. These very liberal appeals and writ policies encourage
the impression that justice ultimately flows from the High Courts and/or
the Supreme Court. They also feed the image that what the lower courts
produce is a lower quality of justice, compounding the credibility problems
these courts already have. These courts therefore become hurdles to get over,
or avoid altogether (for example, through the _writ jurisdiction_), rather than
forums from which final resolution of disputes is expected.[^1/9]

Another symptom of this Indian version of 'appellate-court-itis'[^1/10], is the
common habit of lawyers describing themselves as 'Supreme Court advocate' or
'High Court advocate'. The premium put on these appellate courts means that
associating with them quickly became a status symbol as if some of the charisma
of these institutions would rub off on the lawyers practicing there. This practice,
implying a higher status for a lawyer of a higher court, continues despite India
having a rationalized legal profession since 1961 where there is no strict forumbased
limitation on a lawyer and any lawyer is free to practice in a forum of her
choice. This convention takes a particularly bizarre form when it comes to criminal
lawyers because this is one field where the trial court is by definition the most
important arena where evidence is recorded and where most of the real action
actually occurs. But even then, in contemporary India's endless mediatized debates
on criminal law reform, one will rarely find lawyers who regularly appear in trial
courts. Invariably, it will be the appellate lawyers basking in the reflected glory of
their higher location in the food chain of India's judiciary.

In this Indian malaise, the exalted status of appellate courts is also physically
marked by their entry barriers, enhanced security set-up and monumental
architecture. On the other hand, trial courts are easily accessible and are often
compared derisively to railway stations, those most democratic and unruly of
modern Indian public spaces. Indian appellate-court-itis has been compounded
manifold by the political vanguardism of these courts in the post-emergency
era through PIL. It is important to note that PIL has not only conferred a new
conspicuousness and higher political status to India's appellate judiciary, but to
its _dramatis personae_ as well, the charisma of heroic PIL judges often matched
by those of PIL lawyers, _Amicus Curiae_ and PIL petitioners, even if the latter
are increasingly vestigial, as we shall see. Playing to the gallery is par for the
course and can bring rich dividends. The theatricality of PIL also lends it a
devoted audience of legal journalists, hanging on to every word, who impart to
these performances the publicity implicitly demanded from them. All of these
are important constituencies of India's appellate courts whose self-perception gets
progressively accentuated, thanks to PIL.

***

Returning to live in Delhi in 2006, after being away for nearly four years, I
found that PIL had become ubiquitous in everyday discourses around the city.
The urban fabric seemed torn asunder by PIL cases intervening in almost every
part of the administration. The courts gave the impression of governing the city
through the instrument of PIL. Newspaper headlines routinely quoted statements
by the Delhi High Court threatening to shut down the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi (MCD): 'Stop farmhouse weddings or we will shut MCD: HC'[^1/11] or 'Catch
monkeys or shut down, HC tells MCD'.[^1/12] Slums labelled 'encroachments' were
being demolished all over the city under court orders, the incidents reported with
relish by new periodicals like _Neighbourhood Flash_ and local sub-city supplements
such as _South Delhi Live_ that had begun to come bundled with major newspapers
like the _Hindustan Times_. The city news became the site of both the demand and
supply of the courts' attention. Any political intervention against any of this --- or
even the intention of an intervention --- would be declared 'populist'. In those days, if
one followed the city news at all, PIL was inescapable. The legal correspondent for a
daily newspaper who reported from the Delhi High Court later described the period
to me thus: 'I would have seven bylines in the first six pages. The government used to
function with contempt of court hanging over it.'[^1/13] There were PILs pending related
to so many aspects of the city's governance that newspapers would periodically
carry random lists of such cases --- the case topics in one such list included simian
trouble, stray menace, urinals, no-parking zone, tinted glasses, save Yamuna, nursery
admissions, Blueline buses, traffic fines, MCD demolitions, plastic ban, India Gate
subways, free beds in hospitals, free seats in schools and illicit liquor --- all of these
were just in the Delhi High Court and this was by no means an exhaustive list.[^1/14]

The city was being remade through the means of PIL. Indeed, Delhi had already
been transformed significantly because of PIL cases over the past decade, as we shall
see in Chapter 2. Every aspect of Delhi's transport --- for example, auto rickshaws,
cars, buses, cycle rickshaws --- had been reconfigured because of PIL. Urban heritage
was another arena of PIL's regular intervention: in November 2006, I was a witness
to a well-connected lawyer specializing in heritage conservation cases threatening a
local government official with the words '_Main toh bas PIL thok doongi_ (I will just
slap a PIL \[on you\]).' Later, in December 2007, I heard an environmental scientist
heading a new biodiversity park express the worry that the foreign species he had
planted would be challenged by a PIL (This actually did happen, a year later.)

PIL procedure had enabled the court to monitor and micromanage every aspect
of the city's governance, making the whole city the direct object of its reformative
attention. The all-encompassing nature of the court's control over the city through
PIL was slowly brought home to me as I began to follow the leads thrown up by
newspaper headlines. In 2006, for instance, I was struck by the headline 'Supreme
Court chides Delhi Government for Power Muddle'.[^1/15] The story turned out to
involve a PIL about the lack of access to adequate electricity in the capital city that
had been admitted in 1999 by the Supreme Court at the instance of a _senior advocate_.
The case came to be legally titled '_Power Crisis in National Capital Territory of Delhi
vs Union of India_'. The _senior advocate_ in question was made the _amicus curiae_,
meaning 'friend of the court'. The court went on to supervise the privatization of
electricity in Delhi from 1999 onwards. By 2003, when privatization was complete,
the PIL came to focus on transmission and distribution losses attributed to power
theft. By 2006, this particular PIL's remit had turned to inadequate power supply in
Delhi, and the court heard big power-generating companies talk of setting up 1,000
megawatt gas-based power plants. In May 2006, the judges in this case reportedly
expressed the worry that if the power situation in the capital did not improve, 'how
will we organize the Commonwealth Games in the year 2010 here?'[^1/16] More than
four years before the scheduled games, the PIL court's worry about the availability of
electricity in Delhi was expressed through anxiety about the high-profile event. The
court's ire in this case throughout this period was particularly excited by power theft
in 'illegal' settlements --- unauthorized colonies and especially slum clusters. While
ostensibly the court's concern was the city as a whole, it were these communities
that had emerged as the most visible symbols of illegality in its eyes. It was this
conspicuousness that it wished to erase.

***

I will illustrate the qualitatively transformed nature of the relationship
between the court and the city's heterogenous publics in this period by discussing
three revealing vignettes from three PIL proceedings I _encountered_ during my
fieldwork. The first was in March 2007 during the hearing of a case in which a
two-judge bench of the Supreme Court was supervising the formulation of the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi's draft scheme for grant of _teh bazaari_ (vending
rights) to street vendors in Delhi. The case was _Sudhir Madan vs MCD_.[^1/17] The
MCD scheme had envisaged a process that would require first identifying sites
in the city where hawking could be carried out, then inviting applications from
interested eligible people and then granting such rights. During the day-long
hearing, an alternative was suggested to the MCD scheme by one of the vendors'
organizations. They suggested instead that first a census be conducted for the
existing street vendors in the city and based on that ground-level mapping, vending
rights be formalized at the already existing sites. The judges were livid at such a
suggestion. If such a suggestion was accepted, Justice B. P. Singh interjected, Delhi
would have to be renamed '_Hawker Nagar_ (_lit._ 'hawker city')'. There would soon be
hawkers selling food in the Supreme Court building, he exclaimed.[^1/18]

The second vignette is from a hearing before a two-judge bench of the Delhi
High Court in 2009, where a PIL against begging on the streets of Delhi was
being heard.[^1/19] The presiding judge, Sanjay Kishan Kaul, was particularly agitated
about the proliferation of beggars in Delhi. He was specifically concerned about
having come across beggars even while being chauffeured around the India Gate
roundabout, the heart of the imperial capital. If the situation remained unchanged,
he said, the day was not far when there would be beggars in the High Court
building itself. The bench went on to order the active implementation of 18 'zero
tolerance zones' for beggars in Delhi, including road intersections near New
Delhi's court complexes as well as all railway stations and bus terminals in the city.

My final vignette is from a hearing in a PIL about traffic congestion in Delhi
in 2006,[^1/20] which was narrated to me in an interview by one of the lawyers in
this case. As part of this PIL, the High Court had ordered the removal of a slum
called Nangla Machi, which abutted an arterial road in Central Delhi and was
allegedly causing traffic jams. When arguments were raised by a lawyer for the
slum-dwellers in a court hearing, Justice Vijender Jain pointed out that currently
the slum concerned was less than two kilometres from the High Court. If action
was not taken immediately, he said, the slum dwellers would soon invade the court
premises itself and squat there.

A spectre was haunting the court. The spectre of the unruly masses of the city ---
street hawkers, beggars and slum dwellers --- invading its pristine environs. These were
precisely the unwashed masses that PIL had originally invited into the courtroom.
But now, PIL seemed to have adopted a path where it wanted to devour its own.

Political commentators Nivedita Menon and Aditya Nigam called the fantasy
of 'Delhi-en-route-to-Paris' being played out in the city around 2006, the result
of a 'judicial _coup d'etat_':

>Propelled by a judiciary with no accountability and a media that is deeply
implicated in this new game, there has emerged a technocratic elite which
desires hypermodern cities cleansed of all the 'mess' and 'irrationality' that
comes with democracy and the people.[^1/21]

Clearly, the higher judiciary with PIL as its principal weapon had taken over
Delhi by 2006, affecting changes significantly different from the pious original
aims of the PIL jurisdiction.

How did this jurisdiction of PIL, which arose with the court speaking in
the name of the people, become parasitical on the very same people? Delhi in
the 2000s was going through a process of dramatic transformations that seemed
recognizably along the lines that were being affected in cities all over the world,
usually termed as 'neoliberalism'. What marks Delhi's dislocations as distinct is
their source and their basis --- they were not based, as in the past, on administrative
or municipal policy or executive directions, but on judicial directions in a series of
PILs concerning the city. Delhi had emerged as the most relentless laboratory of
the PIL jurisdiction. The question worth asking is how and why PIL emerged as
the primary agent of 'neo-liberalism' in Delhi. Or rather, why did 'neoliberalism' in
Delhi take the PIL route? This is what I will explore in this book.

A clue to understanding the new role played by the PIL court can be found
in the other commonalities shared by all three of the cases mentioned above. These
were all PILs which dealt squarely with three major problems that Delhi was
perceived as having an excess of --- street vending, begging and traffic congestion.
In each case, the city as a whole was the site for reform. Even more crucially, in
all of these PILs, the petitioner was either irrelevant, had been excised or had
never even existed. All three were PIL cases owned and led by the court itself. A
different form of adjudication --- if one can call such PILs adjudication at all --- was
at work in all three of them.

I will briefly examine each of these three cases to highlight the strange new
powers with which PIL had empowered the court. The street vendors' case, _Sudhir
Madan vs MCD_[^1/22] had been deployed to supervise policy formulation on this issue
since 1987, when it was first filed. The petitioner had been made irrelevant and
an array of parties concerned with street vending involved. The begging case was
slightly different. _Court on Its Own Motion vs In re: begging in Public_ did not have
a petitioner in the first place. The court initiated it as a _suo motu_ case and appointed
an _amicus curiae_ to assist it. The third case, _Hemraj vs Commissioner of Police_, began
with a plea to curtail goods traffic in a specific locality of Delhi called Chhattarpur.
But, after this specific issue had been resolved, _Hemraj_'s remit was expanded to
deal with the problem of traffic congestion in the entire city. The petitioner was
made redundant and an '_amicus curiae_ committee' appointed.

A new kind of judicial process had emerged, entirely court led and managed,
sometimes even initiated and implemented by its own machinery. The court
appointed its own lawyers and instrumentalities. Such radical departures from
basic norms of adjudication could be honed to perfection in PIL cases as they
were never envisaged to have any procedural limitations in the first place. There
was almost no institutional control of these cases at all, except such self-control
that the court wished to exercise.

A new kind of PIL had emerged --- what I call an 'Omnibus PIL'. A PIL that had
originally been filed to address a specific problem in a specific part of the city could
now be turned into a matter that dealt with that particular problem _all over the city_.
In such an Omnibus PIL, the petitioner with his specific concerns about a particular
place would be removed, and an _amicus curiae_ appointed to guide the court. The
whole city would be subject to intervention and correction through this process.

Through this new maneuver, PIL became a means to target those populations
living on the margins of legality, who had hitherto been protected by their elected
representatives. These illegalized citizens were ordinarily not even made parties to these
omnibus PIL proceedings. These conspicuously illegal communities of the urban poor
were seen as obstructing the neat solutions to the problems of the city. They would
have to go as collateral damage. That they were there in the first place was because of
the everyday political networks that Partha Chatterjee has called 'political society'.[^1/23]
These were the networks most drastically unravelled by this new kind of PIL.

The Omnibus PIL-led judicial interventions in almost every area of urban
governance were cumulative and interlinked and are perhaps better understood
as an aggregation rather than as isolated instances. The multiplicity of court-appointed
bodies, the lack of clarity about their terms of reference and procedures,
the extent of their investigative or executive powers and the non-availability of
their records or minutes together made the entire adjudicatory process of PIL
impenetrable and almost impossible to challenge. I came across an example of
such opacity on a blazing hot morning in May 2007 when I received a frantic call
from a friend in Nizamuddin _Basti_, informing me about shops being demolished
near the famous Sufi shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia. On reaching there,
I came across a municipal 'demolition squad' going about their 'job' with large
hammers and pickaxes (the lanes in this area are far too narrow for bulldozers.).

My persistent questions to the Assistant Engineer in charge of this
demolition, about the orders under which it was being carried out, fetched only
a vague response from him about it being a Supreme Court order in the '_M. C.
Mehta case_'.[^1/24] I knew, however, that there were half a dozen '_M. C. Mehta_' cases
pending in the Supreme Court, so this wasn't particularly useful. I made at least 20
phone calls from my mobile phone, standing next to the demolition squad,
just calling all the phone numbers of the various court-appointed committees I
knew of, to try and figure out which of them had ordered this particular action.
But, to no avail. After further requests, the best the leader of the demolition squad
would do was to give me the phone number of the Deputy Commissioner of that
particular municipal zone, for further following up. I mention this instance as
an illustration of the incredible legal illegibility that characterizes the materiality
of PIL procedure. At that point of time, there were so many PIL cases pending
under which both the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court were ordering
demolitions that it was virtually impossible to keep track of them, and people
living and working in the fringes of legality had come to expect the worst.

The orders in these cases were often specific directions, which were
unreported and difficult to access, as they were given in a bewildering array of
'interim' applications in open-ended Omnibus PILs. Indeed, PIL cases did not
often end up in any 'judgments' at all but in an endless spiral of 'orders', which
are not reported in law journals. However, much of the scholarship on PIL has
continued to concentrate on the 'completed' judicial process, i.e. judgments and
other reported decisions of the courts, and the discursive charge they have. Yet
because of the way in which the PIL jurisdiction has developed, most of its
concrete actions are based on interim orders. These are in the nature of what legal
scholar Upendra Baxi has called 'creeping jurisdiction', where the court regularly
hears reports about the status of compliance with its orders, and gives further
interim orders, usually without passing a final judgment.[^1/25] Researching PIL in all
its materiality required me to focus attention on such minutiae rather than rely
solely on judgments as traditional legal scholarship tends to do.

This book tries to engage in a method that Kim Lane Scheppele has described
as 'constitutional ethnography', defined as 'the study of the central legal elements
of polities using methods that are capable of recovering the lived detail of the
politico-legal landscape.'[^1/26] The focus throughout is on 'a set of repertoires that can
be found in real cases and that provide insight into how constitutional regimes
operate.'[^1/27] PIL emerges as a robust instance of constitutionalism seen:

>As a set of practices in which the transnational ambitions of legal globalization
flow over and modify the lived experience of specific local sites, and as a set
of practices in which local sites inescapably alter what can be seen as general
meanings.[^1/28]

The higher judiciary has hardly ever been the locus of such an anthropological
study, and this book hopes to address this lack. While legal academia in India is
obsessed almost exclusively with the higher judiciary, legal anthropology has solely
focused on trial courts and _panchayats_. This perhaps is related to the fetishization
of the unmediated face-to-face interaction with the litigants in a dispute or trial
that the ethnographer can represent, and a discomfort with the heavily mediated
drama of an appellate court --- where the litigant is marginal or even absent and
the lawyers represent their cases through heavily textualized presentations. Of
course, part of the reason PIL is anthropologically interesting is because it is very
deliberately presented as providing substantive, popular justice, unmediated by
legalese and with an emphasis on questions of fact rather than law (even if it is
actually ill-equipped to adjudicate on disputed questions of fact, as we will see).

***

The research for this book was done over a 30-month period in Delhi
between March 2007 and August 2009. The research began with the following
up on one particular demolition notice of one particular slum. The notice listed
a _writ petition_ under which its demolition had been ordered, which none of
the inhabitants of the settlement had ever heard of. I started helping with the
legal response to this action. But understanding and legally responding to this
order required the unravelling of one of the great omnibus PILs then pending in
Delhi High Court --- the _Kalyan Sanstha_ case. Understanding the enormity and
the bizarreness of this case led me to start following a series of cases relating to
slum demolitions in Delhi. For the first one year, my research focus was purely
on PIL cases related to demolitions. But gradually I realized that court-led slum
demolitions had to be studied in the context of other PILs, particularly those
related to urban governance. Thereafter, my fieldwork was aimed at understanding
PIL _per se_ by studying the practices around it. My research involved participant
observation in various PIL courts over a long period. Being a qualified lawyer, I
had no problem accessing the appellate courts, which would otherwise be difficult,
especially the Supreme Court. Having earlier practiced in Delhi as a lawyer for
a year, I was somewhat familiar with the daily life of these court complexes and
could be a fly in the wall when needed.

I would regularly attend hearings of PIL cases and followed some of the key
cases over a long period. In those days, the Chief Justice's court in the Delhi High
Court would exclusively hear PIL cases on Wednesdays. This weekly day-long
event was a perfect place to witness the theatre of PIL. The other regular weekly
event was the Forest Bench in the Supreme Court every Friday afternoon. This
one case had set the pace for so many of the innovations of PIL that witnessing
its proceedings helped me get a sense of just how far gone PIL really was. There
was also the biweekly _tamasha_ of the 'miscellaneous days' of the Supreme Court
on Mondays and Fridays, when matters for admission would be heard. After the
hearings of the specific PIL, the action moved outside where the journalists would
congregate to get bytes and documents from the litigant lawyers.

During this period, I conducted interviews with several lawyers, judges,
journalists, litigants, court commissioners and court-appointed monitoring
committee members, many of whom were old PIL hands. A remarkable aspect
about interviewing lawyers was the effortless ease with which they would move
from cynicism to sincerity --- from being supremely gossipy and irreverent on
court corridors to being dead earnest during interviews, mouthing well-practiced
platitudes.[^1/29] Because the conversation involved PIL, the transition was even more
extreme, moving from the sheer randomness of its everyday reality to its so-called
ideal. During this fieldwork period however, PIL was not just in the courtroom.
It was literally everywhere in the city. Everybody had something to say about
PIL, especially in the media. The extent to which the English newspapers drove
the PIL discourse in the city during this period was astonishing. They performed
as chorus, prompters, critics as well as of course the devoted audience of PIL.
Interacting with regular court reporters both inside and outside the courtroom
was always insightful, especially because unlike the lawyers, they would not so
easily put on masks of sincerity.

This book is aimed at addressing the politics of PIL _per se_. Because PIL is
primarily a revolution in judicial procedure, the focus is on the transformation in
the nature of adjudication itself that PIL enables. Instead of focusing on specific
areas of substantive legal doctrine enunciated in PIL cases, the attempt here has
been to think through the quotidian realities of the PIL process. I argue that the
fundamental nature of PIL is to be understood in terms of its protean nature
that its departures from basic legal procedure make possible, rather than in terms
of the themes it addresses, whether it be gender, environment or urban affairs.
The instances of PIL that have been taken for critical study here are, therefore,
meant to illustrate the kinds of powers that PIL confers to appellate judges. The
fact that there are many PIL judges, who do not necessarily take the liberties
that the judges in the cases I discuss do, does not take away the fact that the PIL
jurisdiction empowers them to do so. These cases illustrate the extreme extent
to which PIL enables judges to go. The emphasis here is not so much on the
unjust outcomes of these cases, rather it is on the profound injustice of the judicial
process adopted in them.

To adapt David Scott's memorable turn of phrase in _Conscripts of Modernity_[^1/30]
to my purposes: PIL has often been talked of as a romance --- if anything, as a
romance gone wrong. In this book I will argue that PIL was a tragedy to begin
with and has over time become a dangerous farce.

Chapter 1 provides a revisionist account of the origin of PIL in India. For
a long time, there has been a general consensus that PIL arose as the court's
attempt at exorcism its guilt for its emergency era performance. The question that
is generally elided is why the response of the court had to be in the form of PIL.
The chapter examines how and why the court chose to perform the rhetorical
performative labour of populism through PIL. This is followed by an analysis of
some of the early controversies around PIL focusing on the radical innovations in
judicial procedure being introduced through this jurisdiction, culminating with a
discussion of the decline of the role of the public interest petitioner.

Chapter 2 is a study of a PIL case filed in the Supreme Court of India in 1985,
which is still pending. This case has single-handedly been responsible for the de-industrialization
of Delhi and has had many significant avatars, with its cause of
action changing multiple times: from pollution caused by stone-crushing units
to pollution in the river Yamuna to removing 'encroachers' from the ridge forest
to mining in areas of neighbouring Haryana's tourist resorts and Aravalli hills to
its closing down of all 'hazardous' and large industries in Delhi to its closing of
all 'non-conforming' industries, finally moving to its most famous avatar --- as 'the
sealing case'. A key attribute common to all of these 'environmental' causes taken
up in this case was that most of the poor adversely affected parties were not even
heard by the court while passing far-reaching orders. Class-based exclusions were
materially inscribed within the adjudicatory processes of PIL.

Chapter 3 examines how the radical nature of PIL procedure enabled it to
function as a highly effective slum demolition machine. Almost a million people
were made homeless by the wonders of PIL in the first decade of the twenty-first
century in Delhi. This ferocious campaign utilized the undemocratic potential of
PIL to the fullest. The chapter will focus on the mechanisms of court-appointed
fact-finding entities, from court commissioners to monitoring committees to
_amicus curiae_. These were combined with the steamrolling quality of omnibus
PIL cases to devastating effect.

Chapter 4 examines in some detail the two principal strands of critique that
PIL has attracted --- one which I call narrowly consequentialist led by the left-liberal
and activist constituency, and the other a more institutional response led
by critical self-reflection from the Bench itself. In the conclusion, I examine as to
how the pathology of PIL has infected Indian legal culture more generally and the
challenge it poses to democracy in India.

PIL in some of these countries in the _State of Uttaranchal vs. Balwant Singh Chaufal

PIL powers so often that novelist Mohammed Hanif joked, 'Even the half of Pakistan

legal system have been undone by interpretations from the appellate courts which
make these reforms meaningless. When strict timeframes for completion of various
processual steps in civil proceedings were introduced in the Civil Procedure Code,
the Supreme Court repeatedly relaxed the timeframes inserted by the amendments
and restored to the courts discretion to dilute them in accordance with the courts'
perceived sense of justice. Ranjan, 'Supreme Court of India and the Jurisprudence of

of serenity in appellate court process which Frank was attacking, or the lack of it in
India, but the normativization of appellate court behaviour as ideal typical judicial
behaviour _per se_.

[^1/18]: The reality of course is that almost all Indian cities are already 'hawker nagars'. The
planned heart of Lutyens' Delhi is perhaps the only exception --- but that is where
Delhi's appellate judges live and work. The organization's lawyer in this case countered
the judge, saying that the 'most modern of cities' have hawkers on the streets, including
London and New York. There followed a factual disagreement with Justice B.P. Singh
insisting that in his biannual trips to London, he had never seen street vendors on
Oxford Street while the lawyer said there indeed were.
