The Indian Supreme Court is widely considered the most powerful judicial
institution in the world.[^2/1] The rise in its power follows the reconfiguration of
Indian political life in the aftermath of the Emergency of 1975--77. In the
last 35 years, it has acquired a central role in Indian public discourse.[^2/2] The principal
means by which the court has acquired its new importance is the phenomenon
of 'Public Interest Litigation', or more commonly PIL --- a term that is too easily
translated into its American (and hence 'global') counterpart but in fact has little
in common with it. PIL is a unique feature of the Indian appellate judiciary. It is
not simply _pro bono_ lawyering, something that a certain tribe of lawyers do, like
in the United States. In India, PIL is a jurisdiction --- that is, what some judges
are empowered to do in a specific capacity provided or interpreted in the law. As
Canadian scholar Jamie Cassels wrote in 1989, 'Unlike the case of public interest
litigation in Canada or the United States, the legal aid/public interest movement in
India has been almost entirely initiated and led by the judiciary.'[^2/3]

The Indian form of PIL jurisdiction was born in the immediate aftermath of
the Emergency, through the ingenuity of the Supreme Court commonly seen as
trying to undo the legacy of its capitulation to the political rulers of that period.
PIL, right from the start, was marked by impatience with technical formalities and
a key rhetorical mode increasingly deployed by judges: arguments made in the name
of 'the people'. In other words, the court redefined itself as the fount of substantive
justice: portraying itself as the 'last resort for the oppressed and bewildered'.[^2/4]

In this article, I will map the discursive context that PIL responded to and
reconfigured with enormous popular appeal --- locating its roots in the political
language of India of the 1970s. In fact, the emergence of PIL was famously hailed
in the early 1980s by the leading Indian legal scholar Upendra Baxi, indicating
that the court had 'at long last' become the 'Supreme Court for Indians'. I will
explore here this 'people's court'[^2/5] aspect of the Indian Supreme Court. My effort,
in particular, is to understand why the court needed to position itself as speaking
for 'the people', and how it managed to do so. I will first address the 'why' and then,
the 'how' of the journey that the Supreme Court of India undertook in the postEmergency
period in order to be able to ventriloquize 'the people'.

## Constitutional roots of PIL

The first question here is this: Why did the Supreme Court emerge so powerfully
only in the post-Emergency period? After all, the court's powers under the Indian
Constitution have remained largely unchanged since the constitution first came
into force in 1950. The answer to this conundrum lies partly in the text of the
constitution and partly in the specific political conjuncture of 1970s India. Sudipta
Kaviraj has argued that, 'the political history of independent India can be divided
into two distinct historical periods to date.'[^2/6] The first lasted until the late 1960s, and
its political life could be 'fit unproblematically into the liberal-individualist format
of constitutional arrangements'. By the late 1970s, Kaviraj argues, there emerged
a new 'vernacular' to Indian politics based on the languages of caste, region and
religion.[^2/7] A similar periodization, I argue, can be made for the Indian Supreme
Court, though in its case, as we shall see, gestures towards vernacularization were
self-consciously adopted to mimic trends in the larger Indian political domain.

The Indian Constitution, in the words of its most famous historian, Granville
Austin is a seamless web of three mutually dependent and intertwined strands : first,
a federal governance structure that has its roots in the late colonial era Act of 1935;
second, principles of democracy and universal adult suffrage providing popular
sovereignty and drawing from the Congress party and the freedom movement; and
finally, and most crucial for our purposes, ideas of social revolution that stemmed, in
an immediate sense, from the Objectives Resolution adopted during the December 1946
Assembly session.[^2/8] The most radical departures signifying a move towards
a postcolonial constitutional framework were incorporated in parts III and IV of
the Constitution, both parts being products of elaborate comparative constitutional
scholarship by the framers. Part III lists 'Fundamental Rights: mostly negative
rights borrowed from Euro--American history, with some interesting departures
facilitating state intervention to ensure socio-religious equality. But, it is part IV
that makes the Indian Constitution a teleological text, a transformative constitution
that squarely tries to deal with 'the social question' of widespread poverty. Its key
provisions prescribe the direction to which the state must aspire (The idea of having
'Directive Principles of State Policy', as these provisions are called, was borrowed
from the Irish Constitution.). Uday Singh Mehta has argued that the incorporation
of such constitutionally prescribed futures implied that 'the nation was now
conceived as a project.'[^2/9] Unlike the U. S. Constitution, the Indian Constitution
was not primarily a procedural document, as American Constitutional scholar
John Hart Ely has argued, but a substantive one.[^2/10] To place it in a comparative
frame made famous by Hannah Arendt, and applied to India by Mehta, the Indian
Constitutional revolution follows the French example, not the American one. It sets
out to deal with 'the social question', i.e., with how the issues of material destitution
and inequality might be addressed. As Mehta writes, 'For Arendt, the American
Constitution served as an ideal in which political power was limited, public freedom
secured, and national unity anchored in the structures of political institutions --- and
all this was possible only because social questions were kept at bay.'[^2/11] But, it is not
the American model that the Indian and most other postcolonial constitutions
adopt. American Constitutionalism 'stemmed from a deep distrust of power. ...
The first impulse of this constitutionalism was thus to limit political power, to be
suspicious of it, and to constrain its reach.' Indian Constitutionalism, on the other
hand, constitutes power and 'celebrates its ambit'.[^2/12] Channeling Arendt's famous
warning that 'every attempt to solve the social question by political means leads to
terror'[^2/13], Mehta suggests that in India too, with such a vision, 'freedom is recessed,
and the tendency for political power to operate without limits deeply ingrained.'[^2/14]

The socially revolutionary agenda of the Indian Constitution, as mentioned
above, is incorporated into the Directive Principles of State Policy. These
principles, though non-justiciable, unlike the Fundamental Rights, were declared
to be 'fundamental in the governance of the country'. As Austin summarized it,
the Directive Principles contain 'a mixture of social revolutionary --- including
classically socialist --- and Hindu and Gandhian provisions.'[^2/15] Mehta explains the
teleological nature of part IV thus:

>This constitutionally enshrined vision of the future is what has often
been seen as implying an activist and capacious state, responsible for the
eradication of poverty, undoing the stigmas of casteism, improving public
health and education, building large industry, facilitating communication,
fostering national unity, and, most broadly, creating conditions for the
exercising of freedom.[^2/16]

But this freedom itself needed to be postponed and seen 'as a future prospect'
that would come about as a result of the project of social revolution. The Indian
Constitution would make the assertion of freedom conditional on achievements
that could be at best prospective. As Mehta argues, 'The successful culmination
to free oneself from imperial subjection led almost immediately to freedom itself
becoming a subsidiary concern; that is, subsidiary to national unity, social uplift,
and a concern with recognition.'[^2/17]

The tension between this implicit ideological devaluation of freedom, which
had been enshrined in the Fundamental Rights chapter and thereby made justiciable,
with the project of the new state, as incorporated in the Directive Principles,
would soon become the principal juristic battleground of the post-independence
period. The political discourse that emerged around it saw Fundamental Rights
as an obstacle to the realization of the social revolution as enunciated in the
Directive Principles. This conflict framed the fraught relationship between the
judiciary and the Congress regimes in the immediate aftermath of the adoption
of the constitution. The most obvious reason for the conflict was that the Supreme
Court had specifically been made the custodian of Fundamental Rights by the
constitution, while the Directive Principles were after all, legally speaking, merely
the aims of the state without any force of law.

The powers of the Supreme Court under the new constitution are important
to note here. The Indian Supreme Court is not a constitutional court alone. It
is a successor not only of the Federal Court set up under the 1935 late colonial
constitutional statute, but also of the Privy Council located in London, which had,
throughout the colonial period, the discretion to entertain and decide all Indian
cases as the final court of appeal. Most important, the Supreme Court brought
into being by the Indian Constitution in 1950 acquired a new _original jurisdiction_
--- to hear _writ petitions_ to enforce fundamental rights against the state. Insofar as
it decides disputes between the central government and the states and between
states, it also functions as a federal court. And insofar as it has the power to grant
'special leave to appeal' under Article 136, it can hear any appeal from any court
in India.

The granting of this last power led to an interesting debate in the Constituent
Assembly. One of the members of the assembly, Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava,
discussed the court's powers with regard to Article 136 in terms that would come
to haunt later.[^2/18] I quote below Bhargava's remarks on Article 136, which was then
numbered 112, and Article 142, then numbered 118.

>Our Supreme Court shall be fully omnipotent as far as a human court
>could be and it shall have all kinds of cases. ... _My humble submission is that
>Article 112 is the remnant of the most accursed political right of the divine right
>of kings. At the same time the jurisdiction of the article is almost divine in its
>nature_, because I understand that the Supreme Court will be able to deliver
>any judgment which does complete justice between states and between the
>persons before it. If you refer to Article 118, you will find that it says
>'The Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree
>or make such order as is necessary for doing _complete justice_ in any cause
>or matter pending before it, and any decree passed or order so made shall
>be enforceable throughout the territory of India in such manner as may be
>prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament.'
>
>So far so good, but my humble submission is that the Privy Council also,
>which as a matter of fact belonged to Great Britain and which was a sign of
>our judicial domination by the British, had very wide powers and proceeded
>to dispense justice according to the principles of natural justice. What is this
>natural justice? This natural justice in the words of the Privy Council is above
>law, and I should like to think that our Supreme Court will also be above law
>in this matter, in this sense that it shall have full right to pass any order which
>it considers just; and in this light, I beg to submit before the House that this
>is a very important section and gives almost unlimited powers and as we
>have got political _swaraj_, we have judicial _swaraj_ certainly. Thus, the Supreme
>Court will be in this sense above law. I want that this jurisdiction which has
>been enjoyed by the Privy Council may be enjoyed and enlarged by our court
>and not restricted by any canon or any provision of law.[^2/19] (My emphasis).

We see here a recognition of the 'accursed' genealogy of the vast powers
given to the Indian Supreme Court, making it in a sense 'above the law'. But
the knee-jerk desire to nationalize this potentially despotic power ensured its
survival. Indeed, another prominent Constituent Assembly member even called
the Supreme Court a potential 'Frankenstein monster'.[^2/20] The 'divine' powers of
the Supreme Court would, however, remain dormant for the first three decades
of its existence but would be essential to the court's new political role in postEmergency
India.

It's interesting to note here, in light of the future growth of PIL ostensibly
as a form of accessing the Supreme Court, that a member of the Constituent
Assembly had suggested that:

>Those citizens who are so poor as not to be able to move the Supreme Court,
should be enabled under proper safeguards, of course at the cost of the
State, to move the Supreme Court in regard to the exercise of any of these
fundamental rights.[^2/21]

Such a simple means to provide access to the Supreme Court to the indigent
was on nobody's agenda at the time. But over time, the court's relative inaccessibility
emerged as the stick to beat it, as we shall see, with long-term consequences.

## The great constitutional conflict: 1950--77

The constitutional provisions underlying the powers of the higher Indian judiciary
would come into play immediately after the constitution came into force on 26
January 1950, with the legal battles on land reform --- the signature post-independence
programme meant to bring about the promised social revolution. The first move
came on 5 June 1950, when the Bihar High Court struck down as unconstitutional
--- as a violation of the right to property --- a law enabling the government to take over
_zamindars_' estates without compensation. Nehru's response to this judgment was
immediate and extreme. The first constitutional amendment was pushed through
Parliament, which would, among other things, declare land-reform statutes beyond
the scope of judicial review.[^2/22] The mood of the moment can be gauged from Nehru's
famous comment in Parliament while debating the amendment: 'Somehow we have
found that this magnificent constitution that we have framed was later kidnapped
and purloined by the Lawyers.'[^2/23] The First Amendment implied, according to an
apocryphal statement by a later chief justice, that 'the Indian Constitution became
the only one that contained a provision providing for protection against itself.'[^2/24] The
more the Supreme Court fought for a higher market-value compensation for the
landlords, the stronger Nehru's response was: he kept amending the constitution to
reverse court decisions.[^2/25] According to the eminent legal scholar Rajeev Dhavan,
by the mid-1950s, the courts had 'backed off --- but gracefully, without wholly
surrendering their power of judicial review.'[^2/26] What emerged from the episode was
a _détente_ with the court and an embrace of what Dhavan calls 'Nehru's Planning
Commission model of law and social change.'[^2/27] This was very much of a piece with
the then dominant modernization theory and its approach to 'law and development',
which privileged the state's desire to carry out social engineering through law. The
lead figure in this _modus vivendi_, the first of many, was Justice Gajendragadkar.
Dhavan describes his approach as being 'to assure the government that judges would
strive for social justice by playing a supportive role in empowering the government
to achieve its goals.'[^2/28] The court, in this period, repeatedly upheld the Parliament's
absolute right to amend the constitution.

This compact imploded in 1967, when the Supreme Court gave a decision
in _I. C. Golaknath vs. State of Punjab_ that would bar any amendment of the
Fundamental Rights chapter in the constitution. The rationale for this decision
had been explained by Justice Hidayatullah in an earlier minority decision from
the Gajendragadkar era, where he wrote:

>The constitution gives so many assurances in part III \[the Fundamental
Rights chapter\] that it would be difficult to think that they were the
plaything of a special majority. To hold that would mean _prima facie_ that
the most solemn part of our constitution stands on the same footing as any
other part.[^2/29]

This time around, in 1967, the court was taking on an apparently much
weaker Congress party, with Indira Gandhi as the new Prime Minister. But, this
turned out to be a miscalculation of Himalayan proportions. In response, Mrs
Gandhi not only passed constitutional amendments to reverse the recent _dictum_
of _Golak Nath_ that had made fundamental rights unamendable; she also launched
a ferocious political attack on the court itself.

Thus began what Austin would call 'the great war, as distinct from earlier
skirmishes, over parliamentary versus judicial supremacy.'[^2/30] For the next six years,
there would be many moves and countermoves by the two sides. The court would
declare unconstitutional some of Mrs Gandhi's key 'socialist' political measures of
the time --- bank nationalization, withdrawal of privy purses and indirect control of
private newspapers. Her response was to launch a massive political campaign against
the Supreme Court, casting it as antisocialist and pro-property. She was re-elected
with a huge majority in 1971, with enough political capital to radically amend the
Constitution, pack the court and declare the need for 'a committed judiciary'. A
series of amendments --- the 24th, 25th and 26th --- followed. The first undid _Golak
Nath_ and restored Parliament's absolute power to amend the Constitution. The
second replaced the term 'compensation' in the right to property with 'amount', thus
restricting the possibility of judicial review of land reform. The third amendment
was really radical. It inserted a new Article 31C that restricted judicial review of
all laws that 'claimed' to implement two key classically socialist directive principles:
Articles 39(b) and 39(c). Violation of the fundamental rights of equality, freedom
and property could no longer be the basis for challenge, as per this amendment. The
architect of Mrs Gandhi's onslaught on the judiciary was an ex-communist lawyer
named Mohan Kumaramangalam. He relentlessly attacked the court's defense
of the right to property as elitist and instead demanded a 'committed judiciary'.
While debating Article 31C in Parliament, Kumaramangalam directly attacked
Supreme Court judges as coming from 'the class of men of money and property
that undemocratic collection of very respectable gentlemen.'[^2/31] Mrs Gandhi was
now at the height of her political powers, and it would require something special
from the Supreme Court to take her on.

A truly special judicial response did emerge in the next crucial battle of this
great war: the case of _His Holiness Swami Kesavananda Bharati vs. State of Kerala_.[^2/32]
This was to become the most influential constitutional case in Indian history.
The legal challenge was to the constitutionality of the far-reaching post-1971
amendments: did Parliament have absolute power to amend the constitution, or
could its amending power be subject to judicial review? This was the 'inner conflict
of constitutionalism'[^2/33] --- political theatre at the highest level. It was heard by a
bench of 13 judges, the largest in the history of the Indian Supreme Court, who
met daily for four and a half hours, over 70 working days, between October 1972
and March 1973.[^2/34] The judgment that emerged on 24 April 1973 was a puzzle,
with 11 opinions running over more than 600 pages. Nine of the judges made a
special statement clarifying the view of the majority, with its famous _dictum_ that
Parliament could not alter the _basic structure_ or framework of the constitution.
And while Parliament could henceforth amend any part of the constitution, the
judiciary could declare the amendment unconstitutional if it violated the '_basic
structure_'. This was the enduring _modus vivendi_ achieved by the court: conceding
a lot, but retaining its final say. It stands as binding precedent to this day, with the
prospect of its being reviewed receding every year.

To return to 1973: Mrs Gandhi's response to the _Kesavananda_ judgment
was swift and devastating. The next day, when the new chief justice was to
be appointed, she chose to violate, for the first time in India, the principle of
seniority conventionally followed in the appointment to this constitutional office,
superseding three of the senior-most judges who had been part of the majority
in _Kesavananda_, and thus compelling all three to resign immediately. This was a
frontal attack on the Supreme Court as an institution, and it was the lowest point
in executive--judicial relations in post-independence Indian history. It is important
to note here the defense that her then chief ideologue, Kumaramangalam, gave for
this decision. He told the Parliament that they wanted a 'forward-looking judge'
and not a 'backward-looking judge'.[^2/35] This language of 'progressive' and 'regressive'
judges was to be the enduring legacy of this period to Indian juridical discourse.

By June 1975, when the Internal Emergency was declared by Mrs Gandhi, the
negative political discourse about the court as an impediment to socialism was only
strengthened further. The Emergency regime constituted a committee to review
the constitution, resulting in the 42nd Amendment. With 59 different clauses,
this was to be the most thoroughgoing and radical constitutional amendment
in Indian history. Its official aim, according to the 'Statement of Objects and
Reasons', was 'to spell out expressly the high ideals of socialism, secularism and
integrity of the nation and give \[the Directive Principles\] precedence over those
Fundamental Rights that had frustrated the Principles' implementation'.[^2/36] It
declared India a 'socialist' and 'secular' republic. Not only was Article 31C (that
had been struck down by _Kesavananda_) reintroduced, it was expanded to provide
that all laws 'declared' to be implementing any of the directive principles, and
not just Articles 39 (b) and (c) as earlier, could no longer be declared invalid
even if they violated the fundamental right to equality, freedom and property. The
shocked opposing voices included H. M. Seervai, who had only recently been
the central government's lead counsel in _Kesavananda_. Arguing against the then
widespread belief, he wrote, 'It was an unfounded assumption, based on the battles
over the right to property, that the Directive Principles were to secure social justice
and the Fundamental Rights were 'mere selfish individual rights'.[^2/37]

Directive Principles had by now explicitly come to be deployed not
just as general constitutional goals, but effectively as resources to empower
the legislature and immunize it from judicial review.[^2/38] This approach put
the judges under considerable pressure. As Dhavan calls it, 'the 1971--76
empowerment/immunization' approach to Directive Principles placed the judges
in an uncomfortable bind. Confronted by an appeal to lofty ideals, they found
themselves 'carried away to concede absolute powers to the government in the
name of socialism and to abnegate their own judicial role'.[^2/39] The Supreme Court
had to respond and out-radicalize the political masters, but the ground for this
battle had been already laid by the apotheosis of the Directive Principles. As
Dhavan argues, the post-Emergency Supreme Court ended up performing this
manoeuver by declaring that the constitution did not just have a _basic structure_,
'but a distinct socioeconomic goal of ameliorating poverty and achieving an
egalitarian distributive justice.'[^2/40] The court declared its constitutional duty to
fulfil the Directive Principles.

Such was the context in which PIL was born. With the birth of PIL, says
Dhavan, the court claimed a partnership with government.

>It seemed to be arguing that these duties could not be deferred or left to
the legislature. \[The Directive Principles\] had to be dealt with immediately.
Of course, they had to be grounded in some guaranteed constitutional or
statutory right. But an underlying sense of purpose was derived not from
these _entitlements_, but from the _goals_ of the Constitution.[^2/41]

It is important to note here that even the new rights discourse of the Supreme
Court in the post-Emergency period was more embedded and interested in
Directive Principles than Fundamental Rights. Dhavan continues:

>\[The judges\] declared a strong constitutional commitment to what they
claim to be the primary purpose of the Constitution, enlarged the role of
activist citizens, and became the mediator of both the values and processes
by which this purpose can be achieved.[^2/42]

An analogy can be drawn here from Kaviraj's essay about Indira Gandhi's
politics, where he argues that even the fierce opposition to Mrs Gandhi, the
response of Jai Prakash Narayan and the Sampoorna Kranti[^2/43] movement were
actually carried out in the language of populism adopted by her. The Supreme
Court, too, in search of a new legitimacy, responded by mimicking Mrs Gandhi's
populism. The battle henceforth was between the competing populisms of the
court and the political class. I would argue that the Supreme Court eventually did
become a 'committed judiciary' with the path it adopted in the early 1980s. There
was, however, one vital difference from this early 1970s ideal --- the court itself
became the self-proclaimed vanguard of the social revolution.

## Understanding the rise of PIL

The axiomatic explanation for the rise of PIL in India has been that it was an
attempt by the post-Emergency Supreme Court to restore its image in the
public eye after the crisis of legitimacy created by its ignominious role during the
Emergency. Yet why did the court have to respond to that crisis of legitimacy in the
_form_ of PIL? To understand why this might not be so obvious, let us first rehearse
the court's infamous Emergency performance. The most widely known instance
of its capitulation during this period was in the _Habeas Corpus_ case[^2/44], where the
court upheld the validity of the draconian Maintenance of Internal Security Act
(MISA). A five-judge bench of the court decided by a four to one majority that
_habeas corpus_ rights had been entirely suspended by the Emergency and that
even a _mala fide_ detention order could not be challenged before the courts.[^2/45] In
the hall of infamy of the Indian Supreme Court, these observations by Justice Beg
in this case will always hold pride of place: 'The care and concern bestowed upon
the welfare of detenus who are well housed, well-fed and well-treated is almost
maternal.' The good judge even felt gratuitously obliged to defend the internal
Emergency, holding that it was justified 'not only by the rapid improvements' in
the seriously dislocated national economy and discipline, but also because 'the
grave dangers of tomorrow, apparent to those who have the eyes to see them, have
been thus averted'.[^2/46] Justice Beg was soon duly rewarded and made Chief Justice
by Mrs Gandhi's regime, superseding Justice Khanna, the only judge with the
courage of conviction to give a dissenting opinion in this case.

The _Habeas Corpus_ case is generally considered the lowest point in the history
of the Indian Supreme Court, and it is the damage done to its reputation by
this judgment that the post-Emergency court is often said to be trying to undo
through PIL. But this still begs the question: Why did the post-Emergency court
choose to craft their political response through the innovation of PIL when,
strictly speaking, there were other means available? Soon after Mrs Gandhi
was re-elected in 1980, she reintroduced a preventive detention statute called
the National Security Act (NSA), which took the place of the now-repealed
MISA. It was challenged before the Supreme Court immediately. Some of the
judges who were part of the majority in '_Habeas Corpus_' (Justices Bhagwati and
Chandrachud) also heard this case[^2/47], giving them a neat opportunity to exorcise
the demons of the Emergency and depart from their ignominious judicial approval
of the clampdown on personal liberty. The Supreme Court, however, did no such
thing. It upheld NSA unanimously. The path not taken here is as interesting as the
path taken --- that of PIL. Even where the court did take on Mrs Gandhi, like in
the 'Minerva Mills' decision, which struck down Article 31C as unconstitutional,
the language of the court --- particularly Justice Bhagwati's partially concurring
judgment --- mirrored Mrs Gandhi's language in astonishing fashion: both declared
Directive Principles part of the '_basic structure_' of the Constitution.[^2/48] One of the
interesting corollaries is that, as Pratap Bhanu Mehta argues, 'all the Supreme
Court's celebrated 'activist' decisions stemmed from a concern for equality rather
than civil liberties. Indeed, civil liberties concerns have been palpably weak in
Indian courts.'[^2/49] Throughout the post-Emergency era, the concern has rarely been
negative liberty from the state; much more often, it is positive liberty through
the state. The court was henceforth more interested in expanding its role through
judicial populism than in performing its classical function of judicial review. The
legacy of MISA was not really undone; instead a new front was opened, that of
PIL. Indeed, the court's cavalier approach to basic civil liberties has continued
in the post-Emergency period, and it has consistently upheld the so-called anti-terror
statutes and other draconian laws throughout this period. In fact, I would
argue that the delegitimization of legal procedure that accompanied the rise of
PIL in India, as we shall see, has actually made it easier for courts to justify and
overlook departures from the basic principles of criminal procedure that mark
such statutes.

Dhavan, writing in 1987, called the emergent PIL turn optimistic in the face
of a widespread state of lawlessness.[^2/50] But in a sense, the legal constituencies for
PIL and for 'state lawlessness' largely diverged. The latter was the concern of civil
liberties lawyers who typically worked in lower courts, dealing with trial litigation
in criminal cases or appeals therefrom, as opposed to the high-profile Supreme
Court and High Court lawyers who wanted to influence policy at the highest
level through PIL. It is quite rare that these two subspecies of lawyers overlap and
the divergence has only increased over the years. Very rarely will one find that a
civil liberties lawyer has filed a PIL. In fact, in the sociology of the Indian legal
profession, there is a clear distinction between trial lawyers and appellate lawyers.
Trial lawyers do, of course, get involved in appeals in the higher courts, but they
are rarely optimistic enough to engage in policy making through litigation. On
the other hand, PILs are increasingly filed as an incitement for judges to enter
the legislative domain. Pious homilies (generally in the form of 'guidelines'[^2/51]) get
delivered in such PILs, allowing the appellate court to sound morally superior,
although these guidelines hardly ever travel to the adjudicative domain, where the
violations of these judicial legislations could actually have any real repercussions.
Increasingly, the court prefers to formulate such legislative guidelines rather than
evolve legal principles on the issue in a considered way. To illustrate this trend,
a useful example would be to compare two recent judgments on extra-judicial
killings by the police, known as 'encounters'. The legal question was on the need
to initiate a criminal investigation against the police by the mandatory filing
of a First Information Report (FIR) in such cases. In 2009, a five-judge bench
of the Andhra Pradesh High Court gave a detailed ruling on this issue with a
careful examination of the provisions relating to investigation in the Indian code
of criminal procedure.[^2/52] This case was argued by some of the leading criminal
lawyers of the country. The decision given was that an FIR had to be filed against
the police to start an investigation in all encounter cases. Soon after, an appeal
was filed against this judgment in the Supreme Court, which promptly stayed
the High Court Judgment. After more than six years, this appeal is still pending,
but the Supreme Court has not found the time to adjudicate on it. Meanwhile,
the Supreme Court heard another appeal on the same broad issue, but this time
it was asked to decide on guidelines relating to this question. The judgment laid
down guidelines in a cavalier manner without a careful understanding of the
existing practices on the issue and without considering the statutory framework
in any depth. The result of this judgment has arguably been counterproductive,
as it decreed that a FIR has to be lodged, but did not specify that it has to be
against the police, and not the dead victims as is currently the practice.[^2/53] This
trend of 'continual and clamorous legislative activity'[^2/54] through PIL is very much
part of the story of law as panacea that emerged in the early 1980s, with the
growing trend of social reform through law reform that has been the subject of
much recent critical reflection.[^2/55]

It is useful here to return to Dhavan's account of the rise of PIL. '\[A\] new
public interest or social action law movement has developed', he writes, 'led,
essentially, by middle-class judges, academics, newspapermen and social activists
who feel that law can be 'turned around' to provide solutions for the poor.'[^2/56]
Notice here that the talk is of a solution to the problems of the poor, not of
taking the law off their backs so it gives them less trouble. This is what makes
it optimistic, and part of the law reform trend of the post-Emergency period.
This new optimism was fundamentally different from E. P. Thompson's famous
argument that even with the existence of 'the black act' in eighteenth-century
England, the 'rule of law' understood as 'the imposing of effective inhibitions
upon power and the defense of the citizen from power's all-intrusive claims' was
'an unqualified human good'.[^2/57] Thompson retained a defensive idea of law. With
PIL, on the other hand, recourse to law is not a defensive strategy but a possible
solution to social problems. Here, the law is not the oppressive tool that can
be turned against itself but is the very source of social revolution. The romance
of the Indian state as being able to reform the unruly social gets significantly
strengthened through PIL. The eminent lawyer Shyam Divan argues that 'until
the 1970s, the role of the court was largely "negative" --- to confine governmental
action within constitutional bounds.'[^2/58] With PIL, as Dhavan suggests, the
concern becomes distributive justice.

>It \[the court\] can no longer fall back on a conservative concern for protecting
life, liberty, property and religious freedom. Rather, it needs to think about
those social welfare, social justice and civil and political rights which might
give its vast millions a real chance both to withstand the pressures of India's
unruly acquisitive capitalism and to fight for their individual and collective
entitlements as full citizens and not just beneficiaries of welfare.[^2/59]

## 'The People' in judicial discourse

In 1979, when PIL, as we know it now, had barely been born, Baxi reflected on the
Indian Supreme Court's new avatar in a lecture. He said,

>There are more references to the people in the constitutional decisions of the
Court since the Sixth General Elections \[of 1977\] than ever before in the
Court's history.[^2/60] He is here referring to the period between 1977 and 1979
--- already 'the people' appear more often in the court's language in these two
years than they had in its prior 27 years of existence. The post-Emergency
court, Baxi observed, was 'seeking legitimacy from the people', and 'in that
sense (loosely) there are elements of populism in what it is doing'.[^2/61]

Lloyd and Susanne Rudolph, writing in 1981, discussed the 1970s battle
of 'Judicial Review versus Parliamentary Sovereignty' as revolving around the
question of who spoke for the people:

>Judges of state high courts and of the Supreme Court claimed to speak from
the authority of the written constitution, which expressed the people's will
as well as the fundamental law of the land. Ruling Congress governments
claimed to speak with the authority of constitutional majorities in parliament,
based on electoral mandates that expressed the people's will.[^2/62]

We have seen so far why the Indian Supreme Court chose to imitate Indira
Gandhi's populism to survive her political onslaught. We shall now see how the
court actually went about developing its legal arsenal to accommodate 'the people'.

The ground for this transition to a 'people's court' was prepared in 1973, in the
landmark '_Kesavananda_' judgment itself. Justices Hegde and Grover, speaking for
the majority of the Supreme Court bench in this case, questioned the assumption
that the Parliament speaks for the people as a whole, but they still did not claim
any access to the people. According to the two judges:

>When a power to amend is given to the people, its contents can be construed
to be larger than when that power is given to a body constituted under that
constitution. Two-thirds of the members of the two Houses of Parliament need not
represent even the majority of the people in this country. Our electoral system is
such that even a minority of voters can elect more than two-thirds of the members
of either House of Parliament. Therefore, the contention on behalf of the Union and
the States that two-thirds of members in the two Houses of Parliament are always
authorized to speak on behalf of the entire people of this country is unacceptable.[^2/63]

A spoke had been put in the wheel of parliamentary legitimacy and, in particular,
its monopoly on speaking for the people. Soon after the Emergency, this issue reemerged
in _State of Rajasthan vs. Union of India_. In 1977, the newly elected Janata
Party government dissolved all the Congress-ruled states' assemblies, invoking
Emergency powers under Article 356. Called on to decide the constitutionality
of such a dissolution, the Supreme Court enthusiastically supported it and,
interestingly, based its decision on the sentiments of the people --- as expressed in the
recent parliamentary election results of 1977. J. Bhagwati was the most eloquent.
Interpreting the electoral mandate, he surmised: 'There is a wall of estrangement
which divides the Government from the people and there is resentment and
antipathy in the hearts of the people against the Government.' He argued that the
consent of the people was the basis of democracy, and 'when that is withdrawn so
entirely and unequivocally', there is 'no room for doubt about the intensity of public
feeling against the ruling party'. J. Bhagwati continued:

>On account of total and massive defeat of the ruling party in the Lok Sabha
elections, the Legislative Assembly of the State has ceased to reflect the
will of the people and there is complete alienation between the Legislative
Assembly and the people.

While the court had begun to claim rhetorical access to the people, it was still
a claim mediated by its interpretation of the election results. But, a pattern had
been set; a decision disastrous for the institutional viability of Indian federalism
was legitimized by the court with hyperbole for reasons of political pragmatism.

Soon after this, we see the birth of Public Interest Litigation (PIL). The
Supreme Court's first programmatic statement about this new phenomenon came
in 1981. In the _Judges' Transfer_ case that year, the rule of _locus standi_ ('standing' is
the American legal equivalent) was relaxed, opening up the doors of the Supreme
Court to 'public-spirited citizens' --- both those wishing to espouse the cause of the
poor and oppressed (who were referred to as having 'representative standing') and
those wishing to enforce performance of public duties (who were said to have 'citizen
standing').[^2/64] Representative standing in Indian PIL was characterized by American
legal scholar Clark Cunningham as enabling litigation similar to class-action suits,
except with a non-class member representing the larger group.[^2/65] A petitioner under
citizen standing, on the other hand, sues not as a representative of others but in his
own right --- as a member of the citizenry at large to whom a public duty is owed.

J. Bhagwati's judgment in the _Judges' Transfer_ case was a kind of manifesto for
PIL. Bhagwati took this opportunity to reflect on the question of standing as:

>of immense importance in a country like India where \[with\] access to justice
being restricted by social and economic constraints, it is necessary to democratize
judicial remedies, remove technical barriers against easy accessibility to justice and
promote public interest litigation so that the large masses of people belonging to
the deprived and exploited sections of humanity may be able to realize and enjoy
the socio-economic rights granted to them and \[so\] these rights may become
meaningful for them instead of remaining mere empty hopes.[^2/66]

J. Bhagwati makes a statement here that would be repeated ad nauseam in
later years:

>But it must not be forgotten that procedure is just a handmaiden of justice
and the cause of justice can never be allowed to be thwarted by any procedural
technicalities. _The Court would therefore unhesitatingly and without the slightest
qualms of conscience cast aside the technical rules of procedure in the exercise of its
dispensing power_ and treat the letter of the public-minded individual as a  _writ
petition_ and act upon it. Today, a vast revolution is taking place in the judicial
process; the theatre of the law is fast changing and the problems of the poor
are coming to the forefront. _The Court has to innovate new methods and devise
new strategies for the purpose of providing access to justice to large masses of people_
who are denied their basic human rights and to whom freedom and liberty
have no meaning.[^2/67]

We see here a tirade against technicalities and a plea for adapting the inherited
British legal system to Indian realities. The rhetoric of indigenization is mobilized
to make a case for legal informalism in the form of PIL.

Kaviraj has argued that 'the evasion of institutional controls' during Mrs
Gandhi's rule was 'accompanied by a rhetoric of radicalism --- a particularly
dangerous combination of a _bourgeois_ leader invoking socialist principles to evade
encumbrances of _bourgeois_ constitutionalism.'[^2/68] Bhagwati would adapt Mrs
Gandhi's strategy to the judiciary --- here was a judge invoking 'the poor' to evade
constitutionalism, the judge himself facilitating a discourse by which legality was
constructed as the enemy of justice. Kaviraj has discussed analogous political
dilemmas more generally:

>The politics of community assertion in India has created a potential conflict
between these two principles of participation and proceduralism. Political
parties representing large communities with a strong sense of grievance have
often regarded procedures of liberal government as unjustified obstacles in
their pursuit of justice. Procedures are sometimes threatened by the politics
of intense participation.[^2/69]

While the nationalist movement initially spoke in the participatory language,
the first two decades of post-independence politics saw a clear attempt to suppress
it and adopt the procedural path.[^2/70] We can see strong parallels to this trajectory in
the judiciary. The court had made a clear choice with PIL --- choosing participation
over procedure. And the language it deployed to justify that choice was that of
indigenization.

## The indigeneity of PIL

Later writers on PIL have emphasized this discourse of indigeneity and
decolonization to establish PIL's status as a 'distinctly Indian' legal phenomenon[^2/71],
arguing, for instance, that PIL 'has cut the umbilical cord between the Indian
legal system and its mentor systems in the "white" common law world'[^2/72] and that
it 'entails reconceptualization of the role of judicial process in at least the Third
World societies'.[^2/73] This culturalist manoeuver to justify the need for PIL as a
peculiarly Indian achievement would be part of its enduring appeal.

The need for a truly 'Indian' jurisprudence achieved through a gesture as
grand as PIL had not always existed. In 1968, the most well-known American
commentator on Indian law, Marc Galanter, was struck by the fact that for Indian
legal professionals, modern Indian law is 'notwithstanding its foreign roots and
origin ... unmistakably Indian in its outlook and operation'.[^2/74] Mrs Gandhi's
assault on the Indian judiciary in the early 1970s tried to undo such a consensus.
She would use the indisputable fact of the relative lack of access to Indian legal
institutions to delegitimize the higher judiciary. Soon after the Emergency was
declared, Mrs Gandhi derided the Indian legal system, saying, 'We have adopted
the Anglo--Saxon juridical system, which often equates liberty with property
\[inadequately providing\] for the needs of the poor and the weak.'[^2/75]

In 1973, the Expert Committee on Legal Aid, chaired by a recent appointee to
the Supreme Court, Justice Krishna Iyer, submitted a report commissioned by the
government that 'viewed itself as a radical critique of Indian legal arrangements'
and spoke glowingly of _nyaya panchayats_ as part of a larger scheme of legal aid
and access to the courts.[^2/76] The follow-up Emergency era 'Report on National
Juridicare: Equal Justice -- Social Justice' was headed by Justice P. N. Bhagwati. This
report argued that '_panchayats_ would remove many of the defects of the British
system of administration of justice, since they would be manned by people with
knowledge of local customs and habits.'[^2/77] Galanter would later reflect on how
these visions of paternalistic indigenous justice, published during the 1975--77
Emergency, provided the basis for future developments like PIL. As he recounted
in 2004, 'In the Krishna Iyer and Bhagwati reports, the imagery of indigenous
justice was combined with celebration of conciliation and local responsiveness
under the leadership of an educated outsider.'[^2/78]

In an essay written a few years after the Emergency, Baxi described the role
these two judges, later the chief architects of PIL, had played as 'legitimators of
the \[Emergency\] regime':

>During the 1975--76 \[E\]mergency, legal aid to the people was one of the
key points of the 20-point programme launched by Indira Gandhi, to which
Justices Krishna Iyer and Bhagwati, themselves deeply committed to the
spread of the legal aid movement, readily responded. They led a nationwide
movement for the promotion of legal services. They organized legal aid camps
in distant villages; they mobilized many a High Court justice to do _padayatras_
(long marches) through villages to solve people's grievances. They, through
'camps' and _lokadalats_ (people's courts), sought to provide deprofessionalized
justice. They also in their extracurial utterances called for a total restructuring
of the legal system, and in particular of the administration of justice. In a
sense, their movement constituted a juridical counterpart of the 1971 _Garibi
Hatao_ (eliminate poverty) campaign, as well as of the 20-Point Programme.[^2/79]

The 42nd Amendment to the constitution, which was introduced during the
Emergency, contained a new Directive Principle titled 'equal justice and free legal
aid'. It read:

>The State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice,
on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal
aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that
opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of
economic or other disabilities.

Legal aid was to be the means to mitigate the expense and the general
lack of access to courts --- by making legal aid itself into a directive principle.
However, while legal aid ordinarily ought to have provided access to legal
services in courts at a cost borne by the state, what instead transpired in postEmergency
India was that the legal process itself was selectively transformed
ostensibly to make it easier for people to access the court. Tribunals were created
in various arenas as replacements to regular courts. While legal aid was meant
to make access to lawyers less expensive or free, it was decided instead that the
judicial apparatus would be transformed to make it so accessible that people
could approach them directly. Dhavan saw in this trend a desire 'to design
alternative structures, processes and normative understanding to show a far
greater proximity to notions of law and justice in civil society.' The principal
means of solving this problem of judicial access was through institutional
changes: at the lowest level, by creating _lok adalats_, or 'people's courts'; at the
intermediate level, by creating tribunals with non-lawyers at the helm; and at
the highest level, by innovating the concept of PIL. Legal technicalities, the
colonial nature of the Indian legal system and complicated procedures were
seen as the principal problems plaguing the system. Law itself, or rather legal
procedure --- especially the standard adversarial nature of legal proceedings --- was
perceived as the enemy of access to justice.

Thus began, as Galanter and Krishnan have argued, the phenomenon of
'debased informalism' in Indian law.[^2/80] While legal aid was neglected and poorly
funded, these other institutional innovations were widely adopted. It was not as
if informal non-state institutions were given power. What happened instead was
that state institutions themselves were transformed and made to behave according
to inchoate ideas of what informal 'traditional' institutions were like. The state's
legal institutions were now set to mimic their fantasy of what they imagined an
informal institution would look like.

Anticipating and leading this trend, during the Emergency both Justices
Krishna Iyer and Bhagwati 'called for thoroughgoing judicial reforms, minimizing
reliance on foreign models of adjudication, including the system of _stare decisis_.
They advocated a return to "_swadeshi_" jurisprudence including justice by popular
tribunals.'[^2/81] Bhagwati spoke of the Indian judicial system as being ill-suited to 'a
country where the majority lived in villages and was ignorant of its legal right'.[^2/82]
Here, we see another symptom of what Kaviraj has diagnosed as the crisis of
institutions in India during that period:

>Legitimacy of institutional power was increasingly giving place to a legitimacy
of individuals; and perhaps still more significant, the new rhetoric of socialism,
indiscriminately used by nearly all political forces, signified something often
fatally misunderstood. Socialist rhetoric often gave a respectable cover for
the re-emergence of an essentially pre-capitalist alphabet of social action.
It looked upon impersonal rules and application of rationalistic norms with
derision, as forms of '_bourgeois_' fastidiousness.[^2/83]

Justice Bhagwati summed up his PIL agenda in clear populist terms in the
'_Judges' Transfer_' case:

>It is necessary for every judge to remember constantly and continually that
our Constitution is not a non-aligned national charter. It is a document
of social revolution which casts an obligation on every instrumentality
including the judiciary, which is a separate but equal branch of the state, to
transform the _status quo ante_. into a new human order in which justice, social,
economic and political will inform all institutions of national life and there
will be equality of status and opportunity for all. The judiciary has therefore
a socio-economic destination and a creative function. It has to use the words
of Granville Austin to become an arm of the socio-economic revolution and
perform an active role calculated to bring social justice within the reach of
the common man. It cannot remain content to act merely as an umpire but it
must be functionally involved in the goal of socio-economic justice.[^2/84]

He followed it up with a dig at:

>The British concept of justicing, which to quote Justice Krishna Iyer
(_Mainstream_, 22 November 1980), is still 'hugged by the heirs of our colonial
legal culture and shared by many on the Bench' is that 'the business of a Judge
is to hold his tongue until the last possible moment and to try to be as wise
as he is paid to look'.[^2/85]

To undo such perceived anachronisms, the Committee on Implementation
of Legal Aid Schemes (CILAS) was established in 1980 by Indira Gandhi, just
back in power, with Justice Bhagwati as chair to effectuate his earlier Emergency-era
report. On 8--9 May 1981, a seminar was organized by CILAS under his
leadership, with many of India's legally active social groups participating. From
the bench and otherwise, the PIL court under Justice Bhagwati 'extended to
journalists, activists, academics, and anyone else who may have been witness to
constitutional neglect and lawlessness' an invitation to participate in this new kind
of judicial process.[^2/86] Right from these early years, therefore, these occupational
groups emerged as PIL's principal constituency. The fact that the birth of PIL
in this post-Emergency period coincided with the rise of new social movements
and investigative journalism in India is not coincidental. Interestingly, PIL was
identified so closely with Justice Bhagwati that most of the early PILs in 1980--82
arose out of letters written by individuals to him in his twin capacities as a judge
of the Supreme Court and the chairperson of CILAS.[^2/87]

## Early controversies around PIL

In this early phase of PIL, a controversy broke out over Justice Bhagwati's actively
soliciting petitions, a fact that drew attention to the judge-led nature of PIL.
Arun Shourie, then editor of the _Indian Express_, gave an interview in 1983 where
he observed:

>A judge of the Supreme Court asked a lawyer to ask me to ask the reporter
to go to these areas, get affidavits from some of the victims who are still alive
and some of them who were dead, from their families. The affidavits were
\[_sic_\] compiled, sent and he entertained a _writ_. Eight months later, someone
came to me saying that the same judge had sent him to ask me to ask the
respondent to file such and such information in a letter through so and so.
A third time a civil rights activist asked that the same thing be done. He
said the judge had asked him. The point that the opponents of the case were
making was that the litigants were choosing a judge. As it turns out, some
judges were choosing their litigants.[^2/88]

From the beginning, the PIL petitioner was a crutch that judges could
rely on to further their own agenda, but as we shall see, even this crutch soon
became unnecessary.

A famous PIL that showcased many of the innovations of the PIL jurisdiction
was the 1984 case of _Bandhua Mukti Morcha vs. Union of India_, filed by an
organization dedicated to ending 'bonded labour'. As analyzed in a much-cited
article on PIL from the late 1980s:

>When the petition was first received, the court appointed two lawyers to
visit the quarries where the bonded labourers were said to be held. This
was followed by a 'socio-legal' investigation of the area undertaken by an
academic, funded principally by the state government in whose area the
offending quarry was sited. The defendants objected to the admission of this
evidence, arguing that it was based only on _ex parte_ statements which had not
been tested by cross-examination, nor were any such investigations within
any of the relevant Supreme Court rules.[^2/89]

Justice Bhagwati rejected this objection by reverting to his standard trope of
Indian difference. He argued that insisting on a rigid legal procedure 'in a country
like India beset by problems of "poverty, illiteracy, deprivation and exploitation"
would be to place fundamental rights beyond the reach of the common man.'
In a far-reaching precedent, he declared that in such PILs, it was not necessary
to be bound by the normal conception of an adversarial trial in which each
party produced witnesses who were then cross-examined by the other side. The
introduction of such evidence could not be resisted by assertions that it was of
no evidentiary value since it could not be subjected to direct cross-examination.
To accept such a conclusion would be to introduce the adversarial procedure in a
situation to which it was totally inapposite.[^2/90]

Justice Bhagwati's usual flourish can be usefully contrasted with another
concurring judgment by Justice Pathak in the same case, which clarified that any
such procedural flexibility would be limited by any contrary statutory provision as
well as by 'principles of natural justice'. But, it was Justice Bhagwati's judgment that
carried the day. One could either be charitable here and recall the old adage 'hard
cases make bad law', or bemoan this fateful departure from constitutionalism, 'as a
version of precommitment related to an ability not to take courses of action which
might offer immediate relief but are fraught with dangers of long-term calamity',
as Kaviraj calls it.[^2/91]

In 1979, Baxi was the first to use the framework of 'judicial populism' to
explain the then imminent rise of PIL, deploying Edward Shils' definition:

>Populism proclaims that the will of the people as such is supreme over every
standard, over the standards of traditional institutions, over the autonomy of
institutions and over the will of other strata. Populism identifies the will of
the people with justice and morality.

Interestingly, clear-eyed as Baxi was, he did not view this new trend as a
problem but saw it instead as strategically opportune. He wrote in the same book
that 'the politics of the Court represents the best hope for the millions of Indians
for a new constitutional dawn'.[^2/92] He even went so far as to argue that 'the interests
of the people require the Court to "lead" and the legislature to "follow"[^2/93] , citing as
explanation "the nagging political realities of India".'[^2/94] Many years later, in 1993,
Baxi would write about PIL as the court's response to the executive's demand for
a 'committed judiciary':

>Throughout the seventies, the executive made its wish public that the judges
and courts should be committed to the Constitution and the promise of
progress and justice within it. Now, led by the Supreme Court of India,
judges and courts have shown their 'commitment'; the executive did not have
this kind of 'commitment' in view at the same time, it cannot repudiate it
publicly.[^2/95]

In an interview in 2011,[^2/96] Justice Bhagwati proudly discusses his sole
authorship of PIL and the circumstances that led him to invent it. He talks of
visiting the poor states of Bihar, Orissa and UP as a judge, of seeing the 'stark naked
poverty' there, and of being moved because 'his' justice had not been reaching
them. In what is still the most widely cited article on PIL, written soon after its
birth, Baxi famously celebrated PIL by arguing that it took 'suffering seriously', as
a result of which 'the Court is being identified by justices as well as people as the
"last resort for the oppressed and the bewildered".'[^2/97] This mobilization of suffering
by the Supreme Court through PIL is evocative of what Hannah Arendt called,
in the context of revolutionary France, 'eloquent pity' as counterposed to 'mute
compassion'.[^2/98] While the latter 'has no notion of the general and no capacity for
generalization,' the former ends up 'depersonalizing the sufferers, lumping them
together into an aggregate the suffering masses, _et cetera_.' Talking of Robespierre,
Arendt says that even if he

>had been motivated by the passion of compassion, his compassion would
have become pity when he brought it out into the open where he could no
longer direct it towards specific suffering and focus it on particular persons.
What had perhaps been genuine passions turned into the boundlessness of
an emotion that seemed to respond only too well to the boundless suffering
of the multitude in their sheer overwhelming numbers. Measured against the
immense sufferings of the immense majority of the people, the impartiality
of justice and law, the application of the same rules to those who sleep in
palaces and those who sleep under the bridges of Paris was like a mockery.[^2/99]

In Uday Mehta's gloss on the uses of such pity in Indian constitutionalism,
following Arendt, he argues:

>Since pity maintains a distance from its object, it can conceive of the object
as embodying an abstraction, or representing a type, such as the poverty-stricken
or the disadvantaged castes or the people of India. And because it
is not limited by the injunction to share in the plight of those it perceives, it
can imagine a redress to their condition that corresponds to the generality
of its perspective.[^2/100]

The Indian Supreme Court soon put the political legitimacy it had accumulated
through PIL to dramatic use. After the gas leak disaster in Bhopal in 1984, a
complex tort litigation ensued.[^2/101] By 1987, while the civil suit was still extant in
a district court in Bhopal, an appeal was pending in the Indian Supreme Court
to decide whether the interim compensation of 2.5 billion rupees was legally
appropriate. This interim relief was meant to address the urgent needs of the victims
before the final compensation amount could be decided by the district court. But
instead of adjudicating this limited issue, the Indian Supreme Court in January 1988
presided over a secret final settlement between the Indian government, as the
sole representative of all the gas victims, and the defendant multinational company
Union Carbide, allowing the company to get away with the relatively minuscule
amount of 470 million dollars.[^2/102] Castigated widely for this apparently unethical
act, the court went on to give a series of post-facto rationalizations over the next four
years. Veena Das's analysis of this judicial discourse reveals how the Supreme Court
would persistently mobilize 'suffering' to perform an 'ornamental function' and
justify itself (150). Thanks to years of PIL, the court was very much at home in the
language of suffering and could deploy it masterfully, if cynically. The court legally
justified the expropriation of the grievance of the victims --- declaring them 'judicially
incompetent' --- by the government that had emerged as the surrogate victim (157).
The mobilization of 'suffering' and 'agony' of the victims 'allowed the judiciary
to create a verbal discourse which legitimized the position of the government as
guardian of the people and the judiciary as protector of the rule of law (159).' Das
lays out the justifications given by the court for its strangely hasty settlement:

>The first imperative to arrive at the meagre settlement was the 'suffering' of
the victims. The second imperative to do this with complete secrecy, and to
present the victims with a _fait accompli_, was the irresponsibility and inability
of the victims to understand the issues that affected their lives (160).

Das concludes, 'In the judicial discourse every reference to victims and their
suffering only served to reify "suffering" while dissolving the real victims in order
that they could be reconstituted into nothing more than verbal objects (164).'
In classic post-PIL language, the court went on to justify itself, 'Legal and
procedural technicalities should yield to the paramount considerations of justice
and humanity' (171). The constitutional provision that the court invoked to give
itself a legal fig leaf in this case was Article 142, the same Draft Article 118
that would literally allow the court to do 'complete justice', which Thakur Das
Bhargava had said in the Constituent Assembly enabled the court to be 'above
law'. This provision had never been used to violate statutory provisions, but Bhopal
opened the floodgates, and since then the court has routinely deployed its 'divine'
power.[^2/103]

## The Curious Case of the Disappearing Public Interest Petitioner

After having been around for more than a decade, PIL had apparently begun to
change.[^2/104] This change is usually explained in ideological terms as coterminous with
the larger changes in India's political economy since the 1990s, when economic
liberalization was initiated. While that may well be the case, the attempt here is
to understand why PIL could serve as such a powerful weapon in the changed
political economic context. I argue that this is precisely because of its (in)formal
characteristics. Our focus here is therefore on a key formal manoeuver signifying
a new phase of judicial populism: the PIL petitioner became an increasingly
redundant figure. At the time of the birth of PIL, the court had needed a public-spirited
petitioner to stand in for the public at
large. But over a period of time,
even this became unnecessary and the court could fold the public into itself.

Cunningham, one of the earliest American commentators on PIL, noted the
trajectory of this change from the cases of representative standing to those of
citizen standing. In early PIL cases:

>In each case, behind the public spirited petitioner the court could see the
faces of particular people in urgent need of justice. However, in more recent
years Indian public interest litigation has come to include cases involving
matters of general public policy in which the petitioner stands for the entire
citizenry of India rather than individual victims of injustice.[^2/105]

And in this latter role of a petitioner citizen, she was merely an informant
bringing an issue concerning the people at large to the court and was no longer the
representative of the victims. She could be superfluous once her minimal role was
performed. This was in accordance with the general trend in the populist trajectory
of the court, which Baxi usefully summarized thus: 'If in the seventies lawyers and
justices achieved a proper conception of judicial power as people's power, in the
eighties the SAL movement innovated a more direct, unmediated form of people--judiciary
partnership.'[^2/106]

The first sign of things to come, indicating the changing fortunes of the
public-spirited petitioner, was in 1988. Sheela Barse, a journalist, had filed a case
regarding the rights of children in prison. Later, Barse wanted to withdraw the
PIL, saying that the court had become dysfunctional and that she was frustrated
with the slow progress of the case as a result of repeated adjournments.

J. Venkatachaliah called this withdrawal application 'a walk-out of the court'.
He dismissed Barse's application for withdrawal after dwelling on her arguments
at length:

>\[Her\] ground is that the proceedings are brought as a 'voluntary action' and
that applicant is entitled to sustain her right to be the 'petitioner-in-person' in a
public interest litigation and that the proceedings cannot be proceeded with after
de-linking her from the proceedings. This again proceeds on certain fallacies as to
the rights of a person who brings a public interest litigation. Any reconnection of
any such vested right in the persons who initiate such proceedings is to introduce
a new and potentially harmful element in the judicial administration of this form
of public law remedy. That apart, what is implicit in the assertion of the applicant
is the appropriation to herself of the right and wisdom to determine the course the
proceedings are to or should take and its pattern. This cannot be recognized. The
petition cannot be permitted to be abandoned at this stage. Only a private litigant
can abandon his claims.

The court removed her as petitioner and appointed the Supreme Court Legal
Aid Committee as petitioner. The _Sheela Barse_ case marked the beginning of the
process that has since become a characteristic feature of PIL: the court claiming
ownership of a PIL case and deciding what direction it was to take.

From the mid-1990s, this process went one step further. The court now began
to wilfully displace the petitioner and appoint a _senior advocate_ as _amicus curiae_
to assist it. This happened most famously in the _Vineet Narain_ case (relating to
political corruption as indicated in the Jain Hawala Diaries). As Chief Justice
Verma observed in this case:

>Even though the matter was brought to the court by certain individuals
claiming to represent public interest, yet as the case progressed, in keeping
with the requirement of public interest, the procedure devised was to appoint
the petitioners' counsel as the _amicus curiae_ and to make such orders from
time to time as were consistent with public interest. Intervention in the
proceedings by everyone else was shut out but permission was granted to all,
who so desired, to render such assistance as they could, and to provide the
relevant material available with them to the _amicus curiae_ for being placed
before the court for its consideration.

The appointment of the _amicus curiae_ is recorded in one of the interim orders
passed in this case:

>Anil Diwan has been requested by us to appear as _Amicus Curiae_ in this
matter. ... It is open to anyone who so desires, to assist Shri Anil Diwan and
to make available to him whatever material he chooses to rely on in public
interest to enable Shri Diwan to effectively and properly discharge functions
as _Amicus Curiae_. Except for this mode of assistance to the learned _Amicus
Curiae_, we do not permit any person either to be impleaded as party or to
appear as an intervenor. In our opinion, this is necessary for expeditious
disposal of the matter and to avoid the focus on the crux of the matter
getting diffused in the present case by the appearance of many persons acting
independently in the garb of public interest.[^2/107]

This dispensation of the petitioner in PIL cases has since become a routine.
Public-spirited petitioners now often appear as impediments to justice rather than
its allies. The court seems to manage just fine without them. A leading commentator
on PIL, S. Muralidhar, now a judge of the Delhi High Court, has been one of the
few voices critical of this trend. He argues that it defeats the very purpose of the
PIL jurisdiction and renders petitioners redundant as mere informants. He writes,
'The petitioners are then entirely at the mercy of the _amicus curiae_ who as the
delegate of the court's screening power can decide who can or cannot petition
the court and what can and cannot be said by them.'[^2/108] In effect, these publicspirited
petitioners are deprived of their right to espouse the public cause because
of this procedural innovation. The PIL petitioner, who might often have greater
knowledge and understanding of the issue than the _amicus curiae_, is thus silenced
without his or her consent.

Once petitioners were made dispensable, the remit of PILs could be enlarged
and extended in unanticipated directions according to the whims of the court. While
a new form of PIL had been made possible by _Vineet Narain_, its full implications took
some time to manifest themselves. Let me provide here three revealing examples of
the unique imbroglios that this new avatar of PIL gave rise to.

The first of these is the so-called _Forest case_[^2/109], one of the most influential and
egregious instances of this new version of PIL, in which forest governance for all
of India has been taken over by the Supreme Court and the _amicus curiae_ Harish
Salve has been requested by the court to screen all applications for intervention.[^2/110]
Any person with any grievance has to first approach the _amicus curiae_ and the
special body appointed by the court called the Central Empowered Committee
(CEC), which can then place it before the court, at its discretion. The far-reaching
effects of such a judicial policy can be gauged from a controversy that arose in
2009. This was regarding the non-recusal of Justice Kapadia in the case before
 the Forest Bench relating to permission given to Vedanta Alumina Ltd. to mine
 bauxite in the Niyamgiri Hills of Odisha, the traditional home of the Dongria
 Kondh tribe. Justice Kapadia apparently held shares in Vedanta's sister company,
 Sterlite and announced it in court as per the 1999 resolution passed in the Chief
 Justices Conference, which required a judge to disclose any involvement with a
 company under litigation before him. But the resolution also said, assuming a
 normal adversarial proceeding, that if no objections were raised by the lawyers for
 either party, it would be presumed that the parties have no objection to the judge.

But in this new kind of PIL, as we know, the only parties heard are the state
and the _amicus curiae_. So, as advocate Prashant Bhushan explains:

> ... the only lawyers represented in the case were those of Vedanta Alumina
Ltd (the project proponent), Odisha Mining Corporation (the mining lease
holder), the Odisha government (the promoter of the project), the Centre's
Environment Ministry (which granted the approval to the refinery), and
the junior _Amicus Curiae_, Uday Lalit (since the senior _amicus_, Mr Harish
Salve, had a retainership from Vedanta). The only lawyer who could have
objected to Justice Kapadia's hearing the matter was Sanjay Parikh who
was representing the tribals in a connected _writ petition_. He was, however,
prevented from speaking by Justice Pasayat on the bench, on three occasions
when he tried to get up to speak. He was told in no uncertain terms that the
_amicus_ could take care of the interests of the tribals and that he would not
be separately heard.[^2/111]

We see thus the removal of representative voices from PIL proceedings, the
assumption being that these voices could be subsumed and represented by the
court and the state, thanks to this new kind of PIL.[^2/112]

Another example of the difficulties that arise because of this trend of the
Supreme Court appointing an _amicus curiae_ and making the petitioner irrelevant
is provided by the case relating to the miscarriage of justice in five criminal trials
relating to some of the most heinous incidents during the Gujarat pogrom of 2002.
The statutory National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the
Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) led by Teesta Setalvad were the petitioners in
this case. Here, too, the court chose to appoint Harish Salve as _amicus curiae_ and
has paid little attention since to the petitioners. In the court hearings of this case
that I attended in 2009, the bench would hear only the _amicus_ and the counsel for the Gujarat
government. To provide a sense of the power that the _amicus_
had vis-à-vis the petitioner, let me quote from Setalvad's interview with the news
magazine _Tehelka_ in 2011:

>Nearly six years after our criminal _writ petition_ praying for the transfer of
investigation in nine major riot cases to the CBI was filed, ... on 26 March 2008 ...
the Supreme Court appointed a SIT. Though it was headed by a
retired CBI director, it comprised ... Gujarat police officials. When the
matter of who would constitute the team came up, the CJP on behalf of the
victim survivors pleaded that only those officers from Gujarat who enjoyed
reputations of neutrality and impeccable integrity should be included. But
to our shock the _amicus_ accepted the names of officers given by the state of
Gujarat without even consulting us. We placed our objections to this unfair
procedure and suggested alternate names but nothing happened.[^2/113]

The petitioners were keen here that an independent investigation be
conducted only by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), but Salve did not
think it would be a good idea. The court finally appointed a Special Investigation
Team (SIT) to independently conduct the investigation in the five riot violence
cases. However, when the SIT's report was given to the court, it chose to keep
it confidential and give copies to the _amicus_ and Gujarat government alone. No
copies were given to any of the petitioners. The day after the report was submitted
in the Supreme Court, the _Times of India_ reported that 'the SIT led by the former
CBI Director R. K. Raghavan told the Supreme Court that the celebrated rights
activist cooked up macabre tales of wanton killings'.[^2/114] It was later revealed that
the _Times of India_ article was based on its interpretation of the SIT report that
had been leaked to the _Times_ correspondent, while the actual petitioners in the
case were not privy to the information. The resultant widespread media reportage
made it appear as if the report had indicted these NGOs rather than the Gujarat
government. But because of the systemically skewed nature of this PIL case, where
the _amicus_ and the state were the only parties with access to the actual report, the
state government's misinformation campaign could not be adequately contested.

The final logical culmination of this new kind of PIL is that the court entirely
does away with the requirement of a petition with the widespread use of _suo moto_
powers, or as it is called in India, 'court on its own motion'. Thus, a 1994 _Hindustan
Times_ article on pollution in Yamuna, titled 'And Quiet Flows the Maily Yamuna',
led the court to convert it, on its own motion, into a  _writ petition_ to clean up the
river Yamuna. The case is usually called 'And Quiet Flows the Maily Yamuna', or
sometimes 'AQFMY'. This particular case is still pending after two decades, and
the court has been supervising a 30 billion rupee project involving the institution
of interceptor drain sewers with the assistance of the _amicus curiae_ Ranjit Kumar.

But even more amazing things have happened in this case. While this _writ
petition_ was pending, the _amicus curiae_ filed I.A. No. 27 [^2/115] in 2002, referring to
the national address of Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, then President of India, on the
eve of Independence Day. It related to the need to interlink various rivers in the
country, to deal with the apparently paradoxical situation of floods in one part
of the country and droughts in other parts. On 16 September 2002, the court,
while considering the said I. A., directed that the application be treated as an
independent _writ petition_ and issued notice to the various state governments as
well as the attorney general for India and passed the following order:

>Based on the speech of the President on the Independence Day Eve
relating to the need of networking of the rivers because of the paradoxical
phenomenon of flood in one part of the country while some other parts face
drought at the same time, the present application is filed. It will be more
appropriate to treat it as independent Public Interest Litigation with the
cause title '_In re_: Networking of Rivers __v.__' Amended cause title be filed
within a week.[^2/116]

Thus, I.A. No. 27 in AQFMY \ \[_Writ Petition_ (Civil) No. 725 of 1994\] was
converted into _In re_: Networking of Rivers \ \[_Writ Petition_ (Civil) No. 512 of
2002\]. In the course of one _suo moto_ case, the court had taken up another. The first
involved the cleaning up of one of India's bigger rivers; the second, piggybacking
on the first, would be India's largest engineering project if it came through.
The latter culminated in the court's final judgment in 2012, which appointed a
committee to execute this project, estimated to cost 5,60,000 crore rupees in 2002,
i.e. a little under a hundred billion dollars.

The _reductio ad absurdum_ of the legal process had been reached, as presaged
by Justice Hidayatullah in 1984, when he predicted that PIL would result in the
'annihilation of all procedure'.[^2/117] Whether this new post-petitioner PIL could
even be called an adjudicative proceeding at all is a moot question. With no
procedural norms to control it and with even the minimal crutch of a petitioner
deemed unnecessary, what was unveiled was a new beast, of a kind perhaps
unknown in modern legal history. The PIL judges could now give free rein to their
ideological predilections; their awesome power had no limits except their own
sense of judgment.

shared the new judicial concern for popular legitimacy: 'The Court is not chosen
by the people and is not responsible to them in the sense in which the House of
the People is. However, it will win for itself a permanent place in the hearts of the
people and augment its moral authority if it can shift the focus of judicial review

economically disadvantaged position, unable to approach the court for relief, any
member of the public can maintain an application for an appropriate direction, order
or writ in the High Court under Article 226 and in case of breach of any fundamental
right of such person or determinate class of persons, in this court under Article 32
seeking judicial redress for the legal wrong or injury caused to such person or
determinate class of persons.' Further, in some cases, the court claimed that it 'will not
insist on a regular writ petition to be filed by the public spirited individual espousing
their cause and seeking relief for them, This Court will readily respond even to a letter
addressed by such individual acting _pro bono_ publico.'

cases, PILs were filed in the name of a class member even though the public-spirited
individual was the real petitioner (as in Hussainara Khatoon's case). In some cases, both

(two journalists and a civil liberties organization) were among the petitioners, as in
