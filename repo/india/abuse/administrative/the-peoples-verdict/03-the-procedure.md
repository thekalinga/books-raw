# THE PROCEDURE

We adopted a simple procedure. Wherever we had our sittings,
the victims came in large numbers and volunteered to give their
statements. Obviously, it was not possible to examine each and every
person ourselves. Therefore, we adopted the procedure of recording
depositions of a few persons from each area, who would give a
general account of how they were all attacked; the incident being
common to all of them. As regards the others, the social activists who
had accompanied us, would record the victims' statements and the
same would be tendered before us.

In addition to the above, we ourselves had asked several
questions to elicit correct information. It is true that the witnesses have
not been cross-examined. But our sittings were open to the public and
all those interested were welcome. We would have been happy if the
police had attended our sittings. But just because there has been no
challenge to the evidence before us, it cannot be said that the evidence
is not reliable. Most of the victims have suffered injuries and have lost
everything; their livelihood, their belongings and their place of living,
They have not been able to get justice, so far. In the case of some,
their earlier statements, in the form of complaints, FIRs and
Panchnamas, are all on record and they have tendered copies of those
documents. Therefore, prima facie, there is no reason why evidence
so received, cannot be accepted.

Moreover, the evidence came to be recorded in an atmosphere
where there was no fear or favour. Ours is a friendly tribunal, where
the victims could give vent to their feelings of the trauma they had
undergone. In this sense, as compared to government-appointed
enquiry commissions, a tribunal like ours has a better chance at
arriving at the truth. In fact, many victims who were nervous about
giving out the names of their assailants to the partisan police, had the
confidence to disclose them to us.

Many of the journalists and social activists who had visited the
scenes of the riots, had their contemporaneous reports which
supported their statements before us. Besides, the audio and video
tapes, vindicated the veracity of the version given by the victims.
