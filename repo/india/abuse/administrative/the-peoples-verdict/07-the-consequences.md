# THE CONSEQUENCES

As to the consequences of the riots, the first and foremost is of
course the loss of precious lives, damaged property, financial ruin of
lakhs of families and loss of jobs, periods in school, mental trauma and
psychological breakdowns. The communalists have however gained huge
funds could be collected by the _Hindutva_ forces in the name of
defending Hindus. Next, the services rendered by the Hindu stalwarts
would be utilised to garner votes in the elections to come. Thirdly,
there had been an ethnic cleansing of sorts in various areas by forcing
out the Muslims.

The police had an opportunity to
play fast and loose with alleged participants in the riots. Many people
were illegally detained and tortured whilst in police custody. Money
was often extracted from the "suspects". The Muslims became
particularly vulnerable after the bomb blasts of 12.3.1993.

We have no complete statistical data of the number of persons
dead, injured or dishoused. However a report prepared by the
Lokshahi Hakk Sanghatana and CPDR entitled "The Bombay Riots, the
Myths and Realities", refers to an extract contained in a note circulated
by the chief minister to the Members of Parliament. According to the
said note the total number of deaths in the riots came to 785, a figure
which we believe is grossly underestimated. In our opinion, the total
number of deaths could well be over a thousand. Many witnesses
have stated that some of the cases of deaths had not been reported or
recorded at the police station. So also, several injured persons who
have deposed before us, did not go to the police station to report due
to fear of the police or due to their preoccupation with survival after
the riots. Quite a large number are permanently handicapped. As to
the number of persons that fled, it could be anywhere between one to
two lakhs. Many have not been able to return and resettle in Bombay.
Over 50,000 persons have been rendered homeless.

As regards the loss of property, Tata Services puts the figure at
Rs. 4,000 crores (Times of India, 5.3.1993). In addition to this, the loss
to trade and business could be about Rs. 1,000 crores and in foreign
trade another Rs. 2,000 crores. The loss of gross value of goods and
services produced in the city could be another Rs. 1,250 crores. We
are referring to some of these figures only to indicate the magnitude of
the problem of relief and rehabilitation which is on a low priority at
the government level.

## Ghettoisation

The residents of Behrampada believe that the _basti_ was saved
because of ghettoisation, whereas in Pratiksha Nagar, the Muslims were
literally driven out because they were in the
minority. Several Muslims who once lived in
Hindu majority areas have expressed a
desire to find out safer places for abodes.
They apprehend efforts to block their return
to their erstwhile residences and places of
business. The goons who reduced them to
penury are still at large and the police and
the administration have, in concrete terms,
done little to inspire real confidence in the minds of those who would
like to return. This is bound to lead to ghettoisation or Beirutisation of
Bombay. The trend, if unchecked will deprive Bombay of the status it
today enjoys. It is known as the commercial and financial capital of
the country and rightly so. No other city in the country whether on
the coast or the interior has the locational advantages of Bombay. The
people collected in this city have contributed their different skills to
raise an erstwhile fishing village into a thriving metropolis. A major
reason for the growth of Bombay has been the open door policy
which has allowed people of different regions to contribute their mite
and produce what may be constituting near about 25% of the GDP of
India.

We know the fate of Beirut. It was the capital of Lebanon, a
tiny country by itself. But Beirut became magnified because of its
cosmopolitan culture and the sophistication and skill of its inhabitants
who made of their city a combination of Paris, London and New York.
The Israeli attacks on Beirut, the battles between the warlords of
Lebanon, the ungovernability of Palestinians who had taken refuge
in Lebanon and the fanaticism of Sunni and Shia militias all
combined to wreck a monument to human ingenuity and dedication.
A green line divides Beirut today and it is a shadow of what it once
was. There is talk of something like this happening to Bombay also.
It is said that small industries are moving out to cities like Jaipur,
Bikaner, Palanpur, Bangalore and Kandla. This may or may not be
true but the emptying of streets by 10:00 p.m. and the general
complaint of sluggishness in the market are portents of bad times to
come.

Hazel D'Lima has stated that though two months had passed
since the riots the Muslims feeling of resentment and anger
persisted. She also says that the Muslims are still apprehensive that
unless they keep their grievances to themselves, they will face the
wrath of the Hindus and be subjected to the treatment meted out to
to them during the December and January
riots. A policeman is supposed to have
told a victim in the Bhandup area, when
the victim was in the lock-up, that unless
the victim uttered the words "Jai Shree
Ram" he would be subjected to urinating
in the mouth. The victim can never forget
this.

## Saffronisation

The beneficiaries of the riots are the communalists and the
religious heads on either side. The slum dwellers did not know
Ayodhya. Now they know the grim reality. They are at the mercy
of these communal elements if they want to survive. What is
unfortunate is that during the riots and during the months preceding
them, there was no organised secular social movement to counter
these elements. Workers who were not divided along communal
lines in the past were seen taking part in _maha-artis_. That is how ,
during the riots, the trade unions belonging to secular fronts were
found playing a passive role. The only consolation is that at several
places people came forward to form peace committees to thwart
communal attacks. Soon after the riots, we could see several secular
fronts coming forward in organising relief measures and restoring
harmony and peace, indicating that there is still some resistance to
saffronisation of this cosmopolitan city and that there is hope, yet.

## Debumanisation and Physical and Mental Trauma

Dr.Murlidhar and Dr.Nagral have stated that in several cases the
rioters did not stop at stabbing but went on to burn and inflict
repeated injuries on the person of the victims. Witnesses have also
stated that there were several instances where a victim was stoned and
after he fell down, kerosene or petrol was sprinkled on him and he
was burnt alive while the crowd was clapping and dancing around the
body. In KEM Hospital, a victim waiting to be operated upon was
stabbed right outside the operation theatre. The evidence shows that
several persons were cut into pieces and in certain cases even heads
were severed from their bodies as in a war. After killing, bodies have
been thrown into nullahs, only to be recovered after several days. All
this shows the depths of dehumanisation and desensitisation that the
killers and the community to which they belong have descended to in
their frenzied moment of militarised communalism.

The majority of the Muslim victims came from amongst the
slum-dwellers; these people led a hand-tomouth
existence and rarely had the time to
ponder over political problems. Except for
the fact that they were born as Muslims,
had Muslim names, indulged in certain alive.
Muslim rituals like prayers and fasting, there
was nothing to distinguish them from their
kind amongst the Hindus, the Dalits or the
Christians. The victims could not
understand why they had been singled out for loot and torture when
the Babri Masjid was a mere name to them. It was news to them that
they had been appeased or formed part of an appeased community.
Their poverty, their illiteracy, their backwardness in every sense of the
word and the misery in which the riots had landed them was a strong
refutation of the charge of their being a pampered minority.

The violence inflicted against them, possibly by outsiders but
undoubtedly aided by their neighbours had traumatised the victims.
For the adults, it was difficult to believe that people who lived in their
neighbourhoods had betrayed them and thus prepared the path for
their ruination. Several victims had developed ailments like speech
disorders, stomach problems, nightmares, anxiety neuroses, fear
psychosis and depression.

Children of affected families could not forget the fear generated
in the faces and voices of the elders, or hearing cries indicative of the
arrival of the rioters. They had to leave their looted and burning
homes and spend time in relief camps. Where once these children
were confident and trustful, they now became confused and lost.
Several children had taken to weeping for no accountable reason. The
slightest sound or noise of an unusual nature would arouse in the
children the fear of a riot recurring. Several children have witnessed
persons being stabbed or burnt right in front of them. The mental
trauma which they have undergone will linger on for years to come
with consequential psychiatric disturbances. Those whose schooling
had been disrupted had lost immeasurably and quite a few had to
permanently give up their schooling as their parents were no longer in
a position to afford to send them to school after the losses they
suffered due to the riots. On the other side were children of the
majority; they had been fed on the belief that Muslims were criminals
and pampered ones at that. Such is the emotional havoc caused by
the riots in this city which will have its repurcussions for generations to
come.

## The Bomb Blasts

The bomb blasts of March 1993 were
a direct reaction to the two bouts of rioting
in December 1992 and January 1993; so say
some of the witnesses. The targets chosen
for the blasts show blind fury at work. The
message seems to be that deaths and losses
of innocents in the riots would be punished
by vigilantes who would seek out their own methods for revenge. But
this round of violence and counter violence can never end and the first
casualty will be the business and commerce of Bombay. The havoc
wrought by the riots and the bomb blasts will require years of labour
to undo the damage. The lives lost can never come back, the homes
burnt and demolished will take years to rebuild, properties lost in the
looting and arson have been lost forever; to restock the homes and
shops of victims will take decades. More important than recouping the
material losses, will be the restoration of that confidence and freedom
from fear which is an essential part of civilised existence everywhere.
How long this will take depends not only upon the business and
commercial interests, the workers and the administration but also by all
sections of the people. The message to be driven home to one and all
is that communalism is poison and that communalists are the
equivalent of moral lepers. This infamy has to go and the earlier it
does so, the better it will be for Bombay.
