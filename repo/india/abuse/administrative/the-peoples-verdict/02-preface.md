# PREFACE

The Chairman of the Indian People's Human Rights Tribunal,
Justice V.R.Krishna Iyer, requested us (Justice S.M.Daud and Justice
H.Suresh) to serve as members of the Tribunal, to probe the
December 1992 and January 1993 riots which rocked Bombay. A
copy of the said reference is annexed hereto and marked as
Annexure I.The Tribunal had its sittings in almost all the affected
areas, on different days, a schedule of which is annexed hereto and
marked as Annexure II.

The Tribunal collected in all about 2046 statements, both
individual and joint, from persons who were affected by the riots. The
Tribunal also recorded evidence of several persons in all the places
where the Tribunal had its sittings. Besides, we have received various
reports from journalists, social activists and various organisations. We
have also collected video tapes, audio tapes, as also newspaper
analyses and reports. The literature on the subject is immense and we
have benefited a great deal by poring over the same. Still, we realise
the likelihood of deficiencies in the report. Perhaps, it is not as
complete as it should be. All that we can plead in extenuation, is the
urgent need to complete the probe as also the report, lest delay push
the riots and its lessons to a forgotten niche of the history of recent
times.

We acknowledge our great debt to the activists who brought the
victims and the knowledgeable ones to us. Their assistance has
proved invaluable. The state government and its agencies, though
served notices and requested to render assistance, have stubbornly
refused to even acknowledge the communications addressed to them.
We could not have expected anything different, seeing that even their
own appointed Commissions receive step-motherly treatment.

We would be remiss if we did not dedicate this report to the
victims of the riots, as also those who brought them succour and
helped expose the guilty ones.
