## Shalimar Express

One afternoon in the spring of 1992, I saw a convoy of military
trucks drive on the dirt track connecting our school to
the village of Aishmuqam. I walked toward the row of willows
and poplars near the aluminum fence of the school to get a clearer
view. The trucks screeched to a halt at the gate of my school. The soldiers
were moving in. The complex was owned by the Geological Survey
of India, but they had shut the offices soon after the fighting started, and
our school had rented some of the buildings. In a few hours, the trucks
had been unloaded and the compound turned into a military camp.

Over the next few days, they built watchtowers and sandbag bunkers
along the school fence. Scores of machine-gun nozzles and sternlooking
soldiers stared from the rectangular firing slats of the bunkers,
draped with wire mesh aimed at deflecting potential grenades. Soon we
had new rules to follow. Parts of the school complex, including half of
the main school building, became off-bounds. We had to carry identity
cards on us and show them every time we entered or left the school.
A sign ordering visitors to prove their identity was put up near the
checkpoint on the school gate. Visitors wrote their names, addresses,
and other details on a register and would enter the school after a body
search by the soldiers.

The soldiers never bothered us. We went to our classes, played football
and cricket, and on our part of the campus, continued talking about
what everyone else was talking about in Kashmir: the war. We feigned
being utterly apolitical if a soldier spoke to us. The soldiers set about
their work of "area domination" --- patrolling the road passing by the
school, leaving early in the morning for crackdowns in neighboring villages.
In a few weeks, my schoolmates and I became used to the sight
of military trucks returning from raids and crackdowns with suspected
militants --- young men tied with ropes being taken into the part of the
school building occupied by the military. At night in our rooms, we
would hear the cries of the prisoners being tortured. Small crowds of
students would gather outside, speculating about the forms of torture
our uniformed neighbors were employing. We talked about helping the
prisoners escape but had neither the means nor the will.

The military camp and its operations were an invitation for a guerrilla
attack. We awaited the inevitable. The soldiers told our teachers to
restrict us to our dorms after sunset.

One evening I was sitting in my room after dinner talking to Shabnam,
now my roommate. The electricity had gone out, and I had lit a candle.
A sudden bang! Another. Rapid, continuous bursts. "Kalashnikov!"
I shouted. And then the louder, retaliatory bursts of light machine guns
positioned in the bunkers along the school boundary. "LMG!" I snuffed
the candle, and we squatted under our windowsill. We listened to the
varying gunfire. There was an element of adventure, thrill. But within a
few minutes the gunfire turned very intense, and the excitement melted
into fear. Shabnam whispered the Quran prayer most Muslims read in
the face of danger. I repeated the prayer known as _Aayat-ul-Kursi,_ or the
Verse of the Throne, after him: _Allah! There is no god but He --- the living, the
self-subsisting, the eternal. Neither slumber can seize Him nor sleep. His are all things,
in the heavens and on earth. His throne extends over the heavens and the earth. And He
feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. For He is Supreme._

Our eyes were drawn to the window. The row of green-roofed, whitewalled
cottages housing the girls, our wide cricket field, and the apricot
and poplar trees forming a sort of a border between us, the asbestossheet
garage for the school bus, the white cotton net hanging from the
poles of the volleyball court, and the mountains in the distance were
shining in a lovely white light. The rough music of gunfire played on. A
boom would sound and a sun would rise, exploding in a blinding flash of
light. I stood in a daze by the window and stared at the sky: A thousand
small suns seemed to have bloomed.

The attack on the school rattled my family; they arranged for me to
move out of the dorm and commute from home. Mother talked about
placing me in Wajahat's school in Anantnag, but that wasn't much safer.
And most schools remained closed almost all the time. One day it was a
protest against an arrest or a killing of an arrested person in an interrogation
center; another day it was a gun battle or a crackdown. The troops
continued setting up camps in school buildings; militants burned down
many others they feared might be converted into military camps. Going
to school was fraught with danger. Wajahat had a close call one day. He
had been playing Snakes and Ladders with a friend in the back row of
their mathematics class when they heard heavy gunfire. The shots were
being fired in the market close to their school. Their teacher decided to
carry on and finished his lecture ten minutes later. Some of the students
were scared and some were excited on hearing gunfire. After a two-hour
lull in the firing, they were allowed to leave the school, which had been
closed for the day.

The school gate was opened, and the students pushed each other to
get out only to find an Indian army tank looming in front of them. The
soldiers instructed the students to run and waved them away. Wajahat
and his friends ran through the empty market toward a bus stop a mile
down the road. Tense soldiers patrolled the area. Wajahat reached a
footwear showroom managed by a friend of our father's whom everyone
called Good Luck. He heard a strange mechanical sound and turned
around to find a tank moving slowly behind him. Alone on the road and
scared, he began walking faster, but the tank rode alongside him. The
barrel of its gun was rotating, pointing at him and then pointing away. "I
thought the soldiers would fire a shell at me. Then I saw the machine gun
mounted on the tank and thought they were more likely to shoot me
with a bullet," Wajahat told me. The tank stopped, and he stopped. The
tank commander shouted at him, "Run! Or do you want to die?" He ran.

Parents wanted to get their children out of Kashmir. The rich were
sending their sons and daughters to Europe and North America; the middle
and the lower middle class chose colleges and universities in Indian
cities and towns. Most students were going to medical and engineering
schools; physics, chemistry, and biochemistry were also popular.
In August 1993, when I had passed my tenth-grade exams, Grandfather
accompanied me to Aligarh Muslim University, three hours from Delhi.
I was supposed to study physics, mathematics, and chemistry for two
years at a school run by the university, then join the college there and
graduate in a social sciences subject that helped earn good marks on the
civil services exam. My brother would follow two years later. When I
left home with Grandfather, my family members, relatives, and neighbors
stood outside our house for the farewell. We walked toward a taxi
with a beige VIP suitcase. I didn't feel sad or troubled. I did not know
how long it would take before I would return home. Every one of my
departures ever since has been a continuation of that moment.

The state transport bus struggled on the narrow highway along the
mountain ridges that overlooks deep gorges and connects Kashmir to the
Indian plains. Halfway into the trip, the bus halted for lunch at a highway
market. It was full of eateries that were called hotels and had strange
names. Hindu Hotel. Sikh Hotel. Muslim Hotel. We ate at the Muslim
Hotel. After a day's journey, we arrived at the nearest railway station in
Jammu. I had never been on a train. An orange sun was setting over barren
plains as we entered the redbrick railway station. Coolies in khaki
shirts, trousers, and red overalls buzzed about us. The platform spilled
with people --- enthusiastic youths, heavily made-up middle-aged women,
their husbands carrying polythene bags and briefcases, relatives seeing
them off. Hawkers with tin flasks of lukewarm tea and coffee ran toward
every potential customer and shouted _Chai garam_! --- hot tea. A nasal voice
speaking in broken English blared out of a railway megaphone, saying that
it regretted the inconvenience caused to the passengers by a train delayed
for ten hours. Ten hours. Inconvenience regretted.

Our maroon train rolled in, and we got into our compartment.
Grandfather told me that the most expensive ones were air-conditioned
and only the rich could afford them; then the slightly less expensive
first-class compartments; then the sleeper class, which we could afford.
The sleeper class was an overcrowded oven. Each section of the compartment
had three berths facing one another and two others across the
aisle. We took our reserved seats, and a few minutes later, I began my
first train journey.

I was uneasy, awkward, and conscious of my ignorance of simple
things like closing a train window or unfolding a berth. The weather was
brutal: hot and humid. My face burned, and my sweat-drenched shirt
stuck to my back. Grandfather's lips were so dry that I could see a layer
of salt on them. The heat became a little more bearable as the Shalimar
Express left the station. "You can drink tea on the train and the cup will
not shake," a friend had told me once. I did, and he was right.

A few hours into the journey, as the Shalimar Express entered Punjab,
two soldiers entered our compartment. Like me, the soldiers had
made a twelve-hour journey through the high mountains to the railway
station in Jammu. Ahead of us was a fourteen-hour train ride to Delhi.
The soldiers smiled and dropped their bags in the aisle. "Will you please
make room for us?" one of them asked a middle-aged man reading a
newsmagazine. "We are going home after a year in Kashmir and don't
have any reservations." The man was unmoved. The soldier repeated his
request, and as I squirmed in my seat, another passenger pointed at the
dirty floor and said, "You may sit there." I was stunned. Grandfather and
I looked at each other. Unlike people in Kashmir, our north Indian fellow
passengers had no reason to be scared of the soldiers: They ordered
them around, and the soldiers obeyed.

After a while the conductor arrived. He wore a white shirt, a black
coat and trousers, and a steel badge near his coat pocket with his name
and the inscription: _TRAVELING TICKET EXAMINER_. "What are you doing
here?" he barked at the soldiers. "Sir, there is no room in other compartments.
Sir! Please accommodate us somewhere," they pleaded. He asked
the soldiers to leave the coach and began to walk away. They followed
him. A few minutes later, they returned and installed themselves on the
floor. "How much did he charge you?" someone asked. "Fifty rupees
each," a soldier said. My co-passengers laughed and chatted about corruption.
"This is India," declared the man with the news magazine.

We reached Delhi in the morning, and by late afternoon, we were
approaching the small town of Aligarh. I watched slumlike clusters of
houses, gray industrial areas, vast empty fields, more slums and villages
where women in saris dried piles of mud cakes in the sun by the railway
track. Two and a half hours later, we walked out of the redbrick railway
station at Aligarh. Outside the station, there were no taxis or local buses
but hundreds of rickshaws pedaled by emaciated men. Grandfather was
reluctant to be pulled by another human being, but it was too hot to
walk the two miles to the university. We felt guilty being pedaled by a
poor man pushing hard against the load of his two passengers and their
bags. "There is terrible poverty here," Grandfather said. He paid the
rickshaw puller twice the fee.

We met some Kashmiri students at the university who helped me
with admissions. The university was overcrowded, and there was no
room in the dorms. But my new Kashmiri friends took me to their hostel
and made some space for me. One of my friends and I saw Grandfather
off at the railway station the next day. I was sad to see him go but also
excited to be in a new place with new friends. I began it well: by walking
out of the railway station with a friend and going off to watch my first
Bollywood movie in a theater.

On my first day, I walked toward the school building with books
and expectations. Sir Syed Ahmad Khan had founded the university in
1920 to provide modern education to Muslims. It was once known as
the Oxford of the East. But it had fallen on bad times and was dying,
like most provincial universities in India. It was no real _aazadi_ from the
misery of Kashmir. The political context of the university made things
worse: It was one of the foremost institutions for Indian Muslims, and
their anxiety and frustration about their position within India was palpable.
I had heard about the sectarian violence and tensions in northern
India, but that had remained a distant abstraction.

In December 1992, about a year before I joined my school in Aligarh,
an extremist Hindu mob had demolished the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya,
a few hundred kilometers from Aligarh. The Hindu right, led by
the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), argued that the mosque had been built
after demolishing an ancient temple. They wanted to construct a Ram
temple on the site of the demolished mosque. The demolition triggered
religious violence throughout India, and thousands were killed. Hilal, a
Kashmiri friend at my new school, had witnessed the violence. Two days
after the demolition of the medieval mosque, Hilal and ten other Kashmiri
students boarded a train from Aligarh to Delhi, where they planned
to catch a bus for Kashmir. _Karsevaks_, the Hindu right activists who had
demolished the mosque in Ayodhya, were traveling on the same train.
They wore regulation saffron headbands and carried saffron-painted
crowbars, tridents, and daggers.

_Karsevaks_ asked the students their names and places of residence.
"Most students gave their real names and said they were from Kashmir,"
Hilal told me. Then he saw frenzied groups of _karsevaks_ calling them
Kashmiri Muslim terrorists and attacking them with crowbars and daggers.
Hilal heard screams and realized the _karsevaks_ were pushing the
injured students off the moving train. A group of _karsevaks_ approached
him and asked his name. His surname, Bhat, is common to both Muslims
and Hindus in Kashmir. "I am a Hindu. My name is Praveen Bhat. My
father's name is Badrinath Bhat," Hilal lied. He feared they might want
to check his identity card or, worse, ask him to drop his trousers so they
would see whether he had a foreskin. Muslims are circumcised; Hindus
are not. Rioters often did that. Fortunately, the group seemed to be in
a hurry and let him go. He wanted to jump off the train at the next stop
but saw a mob on the platform running after Rafiq Sofi, an undergraduate
chemistry student. Hilal hoped his friends in the other compartments
had survived.

The train reached Delhi two hours later. Hilal and another boy waited
outside the Delhi station for the others. They met some, but many were
missing. Later, Hilal learned that his friend and fellow ninth-grade student
Farhat Razak had been stabbed to death. His body was found on the
railways tracks by the police. Another student, Javed Andrabi, was missing
for a month. Reports of an unidentified body found on the tracks
near a town half an hour from Aligarh reached the university. People
who had collected and buried his body had saved his trousers. The tailor's
label on the dead boy's trousers gave the name of the Andrabi family
tailor and town in Kashmir. Andrabi's brother was able to confirm the
dead boy as his brother.

Despite their insecurity and despair in an India witnessing the rise
of Hindu nationalism, most of my Indian Muslim friends were Indian
nationalists. They disagreed with me and other Kashmiri students about
our ideas of an independent Kashmir. They were afraid that the secession
of a Muslim-majority Kashmir from India would make life worse for
India's Muslims. Whenever a cricket match was screened in the television
room of our hostel, my Indian Muslim friends cheered, sang, and
rooted for the Indian cricket team. Kashmiris cheered for Sri Lanka or
Pakistan, or whichever team played against India.

But the rhythms of student life and the confusions and longings of
early youth kept us busy. After two final years of high school, I joined
college in the autumn of 1995 to study political science, sociology, and
English literature. College was mostly uninspiring. No teacher ever
bothered to connect the textbooks to the social and political upheaval
outside the classroom.

I preferred the literature classes. The teacher who taught us Hemingway
spoke in a mixture of Hindi and English, which Hilal told me was
called Hinglish. Few students attended classes, and of those who did,
fewer were able to speak or write a proper sentence in English. Student-politicians
strutted around with henchmen carrying country-made
revolvers. Every other week there were shootings on the campus, and
gang members would beat up other gang members. When the student-politicians
did not scuffle with rivals, they nourished dreams of making
it in Indian politics.

I hung out mostly with other Kashmiri students. We shared stories of
our experiences of the war back home. A boy from Srinagar talked about
learning to play bridge and chess during days and nights of curfew. A boy
from a northern Kashmir town talked about hiding in a storeroom for
hours with his family after the Indian soldiers came under attack. Somebody
talked about the boredom of having to stay inside the house after
sunset, which reminded someone else of the orders from the Indian
troops that anyone stepping out of the house at night should carry a
lantern or a torch, which reminded others of incidents when people
were killed at night after the troops mistook them for militants. Someone
told a story about a madman who used to walk around his town at
night and was shot by a patrol. On phone calls home and visits during
the summer and winter holidays, we heard of and saw more tragedies.
One of those days, on a visit to a friend in the nearby town of Bijbehara,
I had stopped near a graveyard where scores of protesters killed after the
paramilitary had fired on a procession were buried. The age of the dead
on most tombstones was eighteen.

I heard echoes of Kashmir in the pages of Hemingway, Orwell, Dostoyevsky,
and Turgenev, among others. I returned to Hemingway and
began to reread _A Farewell to Arms_. He had written about a faraway war
and yet I saw only Kashmir in his words. Hemingway's narrator, Frederic
Henry, the American ambulance driver for the Italians, said of gunfire:
"I could not see the guns but they were evidently firing directly over
us." It reminded me of the day when I had to escape to a nearby village
with my family after the militants attacked Indian troops in our neighborhood.
Further ahead in the novel, when the British nurse Catherine
Barkley told Henry that her fiancé had been blown to bits and his unit
had sent her the thin leather-bound stick he'd carried, I thought of militant
groups in Kashmir sending copies of the Quran to families of slain
militants.

When I came across an old copy of George Orwell's _Homage to Catalonia_,
I developed an obsession with his merging of the personal and
the political, the small details and the big ideas, his sparse, powerful
prose. _Homage to Catalonia_ brought back many memories of Kashmir and
made me believe that writing similarly about my own war might be possible
someday. I saw the walls of Kashmiri towns when I read Orwell's
writings about Barcelona during the 1936 uprising against the Fascists:
"The revolutionary posters were everywhere, flaming from the walls in
clean reds and blues that made the few remaining advertisements look
like daubs of mud." I heard the songs from the loudspeaker of my local
mosque when he wrote: "Down the Ramblas, the wide central artery of
the town where crowds of people streamed constantly to and fro, the
loudspeakers were bellowing revolutionary songs all day and far into
the night."

When he wrote, "There was much in it that I did not understand, in
some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a
state of affairs worth fighting for," I found him giving voice to my attraction
to the Kashmiri rebellion as a teenager, which was rooted more in
emotional truths than in theories of politics and knowledge of history.

I saw similar windows of understanding opening up in the _Red Cavalry_
stories of Isaac Babel. And when I read about Babel's own disappearance
and murder, I thought again of the arrests and custodial murders
of thousands of young men in Kashmir. In John Steinbeck's chronicle of
displaced farmers, _The Grapes of Wrath_, I saw Indian military camps taking
over orchards and paddy fields around my village in Kashmir. A little
later, the essays of James Baldwin reminded me of the ghettos of Indian
Muslims and lower castes.

I wanted to write like that about Kashmir but kept the thought to
myself. I was not going to be the bureaucrat my family wanted me to
be. Aligarh didn't have much to offer me. I had seen reports of book
launches, film festivals, and theater workshops in Delhi papers. My
brother, Wajahat, was already studying German literature and philosophy
at a university in Delhi. I called Mother and told her about my
unwillingness to prepare for the civil services examination. Arguments
and discussions continued for several months. We arrived at a compromise.
I could train as a lawyer, prepare for the civil services, and write in
my spare time.

I I ended up at the law school at Delhi University. It was a way to be in
Delhi and explore possibilities for writing.
