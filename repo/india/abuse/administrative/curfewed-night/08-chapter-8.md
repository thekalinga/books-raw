## The Trial

The Indian government believed that a Pakistan-based jihadi
group, _Lashkar-e-Taiba_ (the Army of the Pure), which drew its
cadre mostly from the rural poor of Pakistan's Punjab province,
which claimed to fight to end Indian rule in Kashmir, had attacked
the Indian parliament. Hardliners inside and outside the Hindu right's
Bharatiya Janata Party, or the Indian People's Party (BJP), claimed that
December 13 was India's 9/11. They demanded that Indian soldiers cross
the _Line of Control_ and attack the terrorist camps in the part of Kashmir
held by Pakistan. Leading the hardliners was the Indian home minister,
L. K. Advani, who had engineered the rise to power of the BJP in the
1990s.

Within hours of the attack, the Delhi police claimed to have recovered
from the body of Mohammed --- an allegedly Pakistani terrorist
killed in the parliament complex --- a mobile phone, three SIM cards, and
some telephone numbers. Two days later, they arrested three Kashmiri
men and a pregnant housewife and charged them with conspiring in the
attack on the parliament. The police claimed that the telephone numbers
had led them to the Kashmiris. The first to be arrested on December
15 was a thirty-two-year-old Delhi University Arabic lecturer, Syed
Abdul Rahman Geelani. The police said they had picked him up outside
his rented house in North Delhi.

The news of his arrest shocked me. I had met Geelani one evening
in autumn 1999 at Delhi University. A mutual acquaintance from Kashmir
had introduced us. A short, handsome man, Geelani was warm and
bookish. He told me that he had left Kashmir before the insurgency. He
had studied in other parts of India before coming to the university in the
early 1990s. He seemed happy to see me at the university and lamented
the collapse of the educational system in Kashmir. "Delhi will teach you
a lot and open your horizons," he said. "Here, the bigger world opens
to you. Work hard." Geelani had talked a lot about his teaching job at a
Delhi University college. He spoke with the pride of a small-town boy
who had worked his way up to the faculty of a prestigious university. We
walked to the hostel cafeteria for tea. His easygoing manner contrasted
with the nervousness that I had seen in many other young Kashmiris in
Delhi. When we talked about Kashmir, he showed none of the raw passion
or emotion that most Kashmiris did. He seemed to have accepted
Delhi as his world. I saw Geelani occasionally after that, but we did not
progress beyond the usual pleasantries.

In Srinagar, the police arrested two other Kashmiri men: Mohammed
Afzal, who had joined a Kashmiri militant group in the early 1990s,
then laid down his arms and apparently started a business; and Shaukat
Guru, his businessman cousin. They lived in Delhi but had left for the
valley on the day of the attack. The police also arrested Afshan Guru,
Shaukat's wife. All three arrested men were from Baramulla, a border
district in North Kashmir; they lived in the same area in Delhi and knew
one another. They were booked under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism
Ordinance (POTO), introduced a month after the September 11
attacks. In March 2002 the ordinance became a law. Indian opposition
parties and civil rights groups such as Amnesty International opposed it,
but the global war against terror was taking its toll on civil liberties in
India.

The arrested men were interrogated. The police claimed that Afzal,
the main accused, had confessed to his involvement. Rajbir Singh, the
assistant commissioner in the anti-terrorism cell of the Delhi police,
had invited television crews to record Afzal's public confession, which
was then broadcast across India. A tall, sturdy man with rugged features,
Singh had risen from being a lowly subinspector to his present
prestigious position in just a few years. His role in six separate killings
of alleged terrorists and gangsters had provoked questioning by
various Indian newspapers and magazines. Singh was already under a
cloud when the home ministry, under Advani, appointed him to head
the investigation into the attack on the Indian parliament. It was under
Singh's direction that Geelani was arrested.

Soon after Geelani's arrest, I left Srinagar for Baramulla. I drove for
two hours past miles of leafless poplars and apple trees, past soldiers
huddled in small groups around fires of twigs, past gray hills rolling in the
distance. Baramulla began with the striking redbrick complex of a colonial
high school run by British missionaries facing an enormous Indian
military garrison. A little farther on, it was a noisy bazaar of hundreds
of similar shops selling groceries, clothes, stationery, carpets, cement 
--- almost anything. Signs for math tutors or computer-programming
classes competed for attention with models drinking Coke or balancing
precariously on new bikes. The town seemed to live up to its reputation
of relative wealth and high education.

Baramulla stretched along the two banks of the Jhelum River on its
westward journey to Pakistan and the Arabian Sea. I drove across a wide
wooden bridge spanning the river. Thousands of naked brick houses
spread out from the riverbank to the massive arc of mountains forming
the northern limits of the town.

"Where is Professor Geelani's house?" I asked a shopkeeper.

"Are you from the press?" he replied, quickly stepping out of his shop
and shaking my hand. "Geelani is being framed, sir! We know him. He
is no terrorist!" His voice grew louder with every word. "We know him
very well," an older man said. He placed his hand on my shoulder and
looked gravely into my eyes. "He has nothing to do with the parliament
attack." "That is what I was saying." The shopkeeper raised his voice
higher. A small crowd had circled me within seconds. "That boy is an
angel," the old man concluded. I extricated myself. A teenager jumped
into my car and directed the driver to the Geelani house.

We stopped outside an old house of limestone and red brick. A murmur
rose from the crowd in the courtyard, and scores of eyes stared
at me. A frail old man in an elegant sheepskin cap led me inside. "I am
Habibullah. Professor Geelani is my son-in-law," he said. A dozen visitors
reclined against pillows placed along the walls. Everyone rose to
shake our hands. "_Salam-u-alikum Haz! Salam-u-alikum Masterji!_" The same
greeting that people gave my grandfather --- the schoolmaster. Habibullah
had retired as a school headmaster some years earlier.

Somebody brought tea. Habibullah explained slowly, like a teacher.
"Geelani Sahib's father died when he was very young. Life hasn't been
easy for him. But he worked hard for years till he got to teach at Delhi
University." Habibullah insisted that I drink my tea before he continued.
I did. "He is a responsible man. I gave him my daughter in marriage.
They have a boy and a girl. He is a responsible father and a responsible
husband." The visitors drank tea in silence, nodding in agreement. "It is
impossible. He has nothing to do with the parliament attack." Despite
his grief and shock, Habibullah maintained a dignified air. "Hundreds of
people have been coming to the house to express support. They want
to protest on the highway against his arrest. But I have to stop them."
He feared that demonstrations, as they typically did in Kashmir, would
lead to anti-India sloganeering, which would anger the government and
damage the chances of his son-in-law's release. "We will fight for his
release in court."

I then sought out Geelani's younger brother, Bismillah, who lived in
Delhi with Geelani's wife and children. Bismillah told me that he had
visited his brother a week after his arrest; he was living in a cagelike
room at a Delhi police interrogation center. Geelani was limping and
had wounds on his ankles; nylon ropes had left blue marks on his wrists.
Bismillah had brought him some food, but the torture had left Geelani
without the appetite or energy to eat. The brothers met again a week
later, this time in jail, where Geelani was in solitary confinement and
denied access to books, paper, or the jail library. Criminals looked upon
him as a terrorist and an _anti-national_ and had assaulted him several
times. Around that time, university officials suspended Geelani from his
teaching job.

In May 2002 the police filed a charge sheet against him. At the same
time, his landlord evicted his wife and children, who had to find refuge
in a Muslim ghetto in another part of the city. It was not until July
that Geelani's trial began. It proceeded not under the usual Indian law
but under the controversial new Prevention of Terrorism Act. Amnesty
International questioned whether a fair trial was possible. The Indian
law ministry appointed Shiv Narayan Dhingra as a special judge. Dhingra
had specialized in cases of terrorism and had earned the nickname _The
Hanging Judge_.

I was assigned to report on the trial. Policemen with automatic rifles
guarded the courtroom; they checked my identity card and frisked me
before allowing me inside. I had expected a crowd of reporters but was
surprised to see very few there. Policemen, both uniformed and plainclothed,
occupied most of the chairs, along with the lawyers in black
gowns. Geelani stood in the dock with the other accused. I thought of
our first meeting at Delhi University in 1999. He now stood before me,
accused of conspiring in the attack on the Indian parliament that had
almost triggered a nuclear war between India and Pakistan. I couldn't
stop looking at his handcuffs and at the three armed policemen watching
him. Over the next few months, I kept going back to the trial. Each
time Geelani's brother, Bismillah, and father-in-law, Habibullah, sat
in the courtroom with gloomy faces. And each time Geelani stood in
the dock with the same serene expression. I often wondered why he
appeared so unfazed.

Perhaps he was given hope by the Indian intellectuals who believed
that he was innocent and had come together under the banner of the All
India Defense Committee for Syed Abdul Rahman Geelani. Many teachers
and journalists had written letters of protest to the Chief Justice. Initially,
there was no criminal lawyer ready to defend him in court. Finally,
Seema Gulati, a well-known, sought-after criminal lawyer, agreed. Her
high fees were paid by contributions from university teachers, lawyers,
and civil rights activists.

The prosecution presented the evidence. It said that Geelani had
received a call on his mobile phone on December 14, 2001, from Kashmir,
in which he had supported the previous day's attack on the parliament.
This two-and-a-half-minute telephone conversation in Kashmiri with
his younger brother was the main evidence against him. The police had
it translated by a semiliterate Kashmiri youth, Rashid Ali, who worked
as a fruit vendor in North Delhi. The incriminating evidence, according
to the police translation, was this:

>Caller (Faisal): "What is this you have
>done in Delhi?"
>
>Receiver (Geelani): "This was necessary."

The conversation, police said, revealed the role of the teacher in
the conspiracy to attack the parliament. Seema Gulati produced two
respected Kashmiris as defense witnesses: Sampath Prakash, a veteran
trade union leader from Srinagar; and Sanjay Kak, a well-known filmmaker.
The witnesses maintained that the call was an innocent conversation
between two brothers that had been mistranslated. Kak's
translation of the same conversation was markedly different.

>Caller:
>"What's happened?"
>
>Receiver: "What? In Delhi?"
>
>Caller: "What's happened?
>In Delhi?"
>
>Receiver (noise, laughter): "By God!"

Giving evidence
in court, Kak said, "The Kashmiri equivalent of 'What's happened?' is _Yeh
Kya Korua_. It is a broad term used in all kinds of circumstances, such as
when a child spills a glass of milk or when there is snowfall or a marital
dispute. Geelani's brother had called simply to get a syllabus and a prospectus."
Kak translated that portion of the call as:

>Receiver (Geelani):
>"Tell me what you want?"
>
>Caller (Faisal): "Syllabus and prospectus."

The
  boy was preparing for the medical school entrance examination and
  wanted a brochure of a school in Delhi.

During
the cross-examination, Ali --- the police translator --- admitted
that he could not understand English; he was also shaky in Hindi, the
language into which he had translated the call. That day I saw Bismillah
and Habibullah smile. Testimonies by independent witnesses seemed to
tilt the balance in favor of Geelani's innocence.

One day a fellow reporter, Shams Tahir Khan, who worked for _Aaj
Tak_, a popular Hindi-language Indian news channel, took the stand. He
was one of the television reporters invited by Singh --- the Delhi police
officer --- to record the confession of the main accused Mohammed Afzal
after his arrest. The full version of the video interview was played in
the courtroom. Afzal was seen saying that Geelani was a professor and
that he, Afzal, "never shared any of this \[terrorism-related\] information
with him." Khan told the court that Assistant Commissioner Singh had
requested the media not to relay that part of the interview. Geelani,
his relatives, and his lawyer seemed more relieved; their smiles were
broader.

Other days revealed other flaws in the case against Geelani. By
November the witnesses had testified, the accused had given their
statements, and the final arguments in the case had begun. The Delhi
high court had ordered that Geelani's handcuffs be taken off, though
armed policemen still filled the courtroom. Barring a few reporters, the
media continued to ignore the trial. The prosecution argued for Geelani's
conviction for conspiring in the attack on the Indian parliament.
The grounds were that he had supported the attack while talking on the
phone; he knew the other accused; his phone number was found on
their phones; and he had received calls from one of the accused on the
day of the attack. Geelani did not deny knowing the co-accused and
speaking to them on the phone.

On December 16, 2002, when the judge was to deliver the verdict,
Habibullah did not come to the court. Instead, led by Singh, personnel
from the Delhi police's anti-terrorism wing --- who had arrested Geelani
and conducted the investigation --- filled the courtroom. The policemen,
who were usually unshaven and shabbily clothed, were dressed in
expensive suits with matching neckties. They would look good in the
newspaper photographs tomorrow, I thought. The courtroom was for
once crowded with reporters. I stood close to the judge's table, hoping
to hear every word of the verdict. It was very humid. A reporter shouted
at an attendant to switch on the air conditioner. It did not work. A
reporter standing behind me placed his notebook on my back for support
to take notes.

Judge Dhingra walked in. There was a long silence in the courtroom.
Nobody moved while he pronounced the verdict. He held the accused
teacher, Geelani, guilty of "conspiracy to attack the parliament, wage
war against the government of India, murder and grievous hurt." The
two other men were also found guilty. Geelani remained silent. I kept
looking at him. He seemed to see me, but his eyes said nothing. Two
days after the verdict, Judge Dhingra sentenced Geelani to death, along
with the co-accused Kashmiris --- Mohammed Afzal and Shaukat Guru.

Geelani was stoic and sought the judge's permission to speak to the
journalists. Judge Dhingra granted it. "Without justice, there will be no
democracy. It is the Indian democracy that is under threat," Geelani
shouted.

Policemen whisked Geelani and the other convicted men toward
prison trucks. Television crews jostled for close-ups. Bismillah watched
him being taken away and burst into tears. In Baramulla, hundreds of
protesters burst out onto the streets as the news spread.

One of India's most respected lawyers and a former federal law minister,
Ram Jethmalani, agreed to defend Geelani in the higher courts
without payment, prompting activists of the Hindu extremist Shiv Sena
(the Army of Shivaji, named after a medieval Hindu chieftain who fought
the Mughal rulers of India) to burn the lawyer in effigy as a traitor and
threaten him with consequences if he honored his promise. Jethmalani
stood his ground. He filed an appeal against Geelani's conviction in the
Delhi high court. Its judges began their hearings in April 2003. Hearings
and arguments followed. If Judge Dhingra's order was upheld, Geelani
would be hanged.

In October the high court pronounced its verdict. Geelani was
acquitted of all charges. He was free. He is back at his college, teaching.
