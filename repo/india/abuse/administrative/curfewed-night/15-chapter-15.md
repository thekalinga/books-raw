## The Missing Shiva

The practice of Islam in Kashmir borrowed elements from the
Hindu and the Buddhist past; the Hindus in turn were influenced
by Muslim practices. In my childhood, nobody raised an
eyebrow if a Hindu woman went to a Muslim shrine to seek the blessings
of a saint. The religious divide was visible only on the days India
and Pakistan played cricket. Muslims supported the Pakistani cricket
team; Pandits were for India. Yet the tensions, which were partly class-based,
never simmered into sectarian violence. Nobody was surprised
if a Hindu and a Muslim were friends. My father's best friend was and
remains a Pandit; my mother had long friendships with Pandit women
who taught in the same school.

Things fell apart after the eruption of the armed conflict. The separatist
militants had no tolerance for dissent. Along with killing hundreds of
Muslim pro-India political activists and suspected informers for Indian
intelligence, they killed a few hundred Pandits on similar grounds or
without any reason at all. The murders sent a wave of fear through the
community, and more than a hundred thousand Pandits left Kashmir
after March 1990. The affluent moved to houses in Jammu, Delhi, and
various Indian cities. But a vast majority could find shelter only in the
squalor of refugee camps and rented rooms in Jammu and Delhi.

Despite the ensuing bitterness, both Muslims and Pandits tried to
maintain their personal relationships. My father stayed in touch with
his Pandit friends and visited them in Jammu and Delhi whenever he
was there. Mrs. Kaul, my landlady in Delhi, often talked about her memories
of Kashmir. She recounted tying threads at the shrine of Sheikh
Nooruddin or visiting the shrines close to her ancestral house in central
Srinagar. Living in various cities of India, the Pandits hoped to return
home someday. Even those who were too old to begin life anew pined
for the homes they had left behind. Most Pandit houses were abandoned
or burned during the conflict and the temple complexes taken over by
the Indian military.

In my childhood, I visited the local temples with my Hindu friends,
mostly the ancient Martand sun temple near my village. I remembered
a visit to the Martand temple, when my Pandit friend Vinod told me
authoritatively about the temple being built by the Pandavas, the five
heroes of _The Mahabharata_. The five brothers had defeated their hundred
villainous cousins, the Kaurvas, with help from Krishna. Vinod told me
that the massive boulders of the temple were lifted to their position
by the giant Pandava brother, Bhima. Our school principal corrected
us: "Lalitaditya, one of the greatest kings of Kashmir, built the temple."
Muktapida Lalitaditya had ruled Kashmir from the end of the seventh
century to the mid-eighth century and is believed to have conquered a
lot of India, Iran, and Central Asia.

_Would the Martand sun temple, too, be a garrison?_ I wondered. Or would
some teacher still be telling his students about its place in the history
of Kashmir? I left Srinagar for my ancestral village, spent a day with my
grandparents, then headed for Martand. I took a bus from the busy town
square in Mattan, three miles from my village and the site of my first
school, the Lyceum, for the Martand temple. The bus followed the same
winding road up a plateau that I had taken years ago on school excursions.
The barren mountains, the bad roads, the muddy lanes of the villages
surrounding Martand hadn't changed in twenty years. The bluish
limestone temple stood like a wrinkled patriarch. Most of the colonnaded
wall stretching from the entrance to form a square around the
temple had collapsed. Inside the temple chamber, wild grass and weeds
grew. The memory of my school excursion with Vinod was still vivid.
The temple complex had seemed colossal to our eyes then. It felt diminished
now.

I walked back and waited by the desolate roadside for a bus. I missed
Vinod. I had not seen him since the conflict erupted. I was twelve when
I left the Lyceum for a boarding school; his family had migrated to the
southern province of Jammu.

Vinod was a plump boy with cheeks so red that I thought he wore
makeup. After school, we would usually rush to bathe in a temple
complex spring nearby. We would try to scare each other by shouting
"Snake" from the bank of the spring. We also loved to explore a nearby
cluster of caves cut into a limestone cliff. He believed that if we kept
going in the dark tunnel, we would reach China. Scared by the darkness,
we never ventured beyond a few feet. I learned to ride a bicycle on his
red Atlas on the road leading to the caves.

There were no signs of the bus on the road outside Martand temple. I
walked the few kilometers to Mattan. Vinod used to live in the adjoining
village. From a roundabout, I saw people walking down the lane leading
to his village. I could not hold myself back and followed the road. A
mile ahead, a dirt track ran across paddy fields to a grove of walnut trees
near his house. Men and women worked in the fields, and children rode
down the dirt lane on bicycles. The Pandit houses stood apart in their
desolation. I remembered the way to his two-story house, and in a few
minutes, I was there. An old brass lock stared from the wooden door,
and cobwebs decorated the closed windows. Vinod's family seemed to
have left in a hurry; he did not even come to say good-bye or leave an
address.

The next morning I visited our old school, hoping to meet our lovable
principal, Kantroo. A freshly painted sign hanging on the school
read: _LYCEUM PUBLIC SCHOOL_. The building looked the same. There were
new faces in the same gray shorts and white shirts. I knocked on the
principal's door. A middle-aged man in a casual shirt and jeans opened
the door. I introduced myself and asked for Kantroo. He offered me a
seat and said, "I am the principal." He sat in my old teacher's chair. "Mr.
Kantroo migrated to Jammu in 2002." The new principal knew where in
Jammu my teacher lived but did not have his phone number. I left knowing
I had to visit my teacher and find Vinod.

Jammu, a small city with brutal summers, had become the refuge for
most Kashmiri Pandits. I was nervous at the prospect of seeing my
teacher and my childhood friend as refugees. Some years ago I had been
in Jammu as a reporter, visiting the migrant camps. On the outskirts of
the city, surrounded by desolate land full of wild bushes, I reached a
cluster of one-room brick huts stacked together in long claustrophobic
rows. "Nobody cares about us," a teenager told me. He did not speak like
a Kashmiri. And he hated Muslims. I could not muster the courage to tell
him I was one. I told him I was a Punjabi from Delhi. I walked around,
trying to locate the people from my part of Kashmir. A fiftysomething
man in white _kurta_ pajamas appeared out of a narrow lane. I asked him
if he knew anyone from Anantnag. He looked at me carefully.

"Are you
from there?"

"Yes," I replied.

"Where in Anantnag?"

"Seer," I said.

"You are from Seer! Whose son are you?"

I gave my father's and my grandfather's name. In my part of the world,
you are always your father's son and your grandfather's grandson. His
eyes lit up. He laughed, swore at me fondly, and hugged me. Before I
could ask him who he was, he grabbed my arm and told me to keep my
mouth shut and follow him. We walked through the dirty, cramped lanes
running between rows of camp houses. He stopped outside a shabby
hut where a frail woman was washing clothes. "Get up, Gowri!" he said.
"Hug him! He is your son!"

She didn't recognize me, and we reluctantly hugged. "She is your
father's sister," Avatar told me. I stood there completely perplexed. My
father never had a sister. I was stunned when the woman said, "Is he
Ammul's son?" Ammul was my father's childhood nickname, which
hardly anyone outside the family knew. She looked at me again, held
me in her arms, and cried. Her husband sat on the ground and broke
down. My eyes were wet. Gowri abandoned her half-washed clothes in
a bucket near the communal tap. We walked into their one-room hut. A
bed took up most of the space in the room. In a corner was a tiny kitchenette.
Gowri moved a few utensils and made room to squat before a
small gas stove and brew tea.

We talked for two hours about Kashmir and our lives there before
the armed conflict. They lived in a neighboring village near my uncle's
house, where my father spent his childhood and adolescence. In his
early twenties, he worked as a teacher in Pulwama. Gowri also had a job
in the village. Her parents worried about her traveling back and forth
alone every day. "They allowed me to join there only after they knew
your father would take me along," she said.

On the walls hung clothes and pictures of Shiva, Rama, Krishna, and
Saraswati. I was about to leave when a young girl walked in almost unnoticed.
She had Gowri's face and Avatar's black eyes minus the wrinkles
and the grief. We were introduced. I made small talk about her school.
She sat on the edge of the bed uneasily, her school bag on her lap. Sweat
rolled from her forehead like teardrops.

August is a time of miserable heat in Jammu. I had become oblivious
to the heat on meeting Gowri and Avatar. I felt my shirt sticking to my
back despite the whining ceiling fan. The girl turned to her mother with
a pleading glance. Gowri asked Avatar and me to take a walk outside. The
girl had to change. She was thirteen. There was no other room. There
were no prospects of a bigger house in sight for them. And the girl was
growing up. How long could she sleep on a mattress on the floor beside
the bed her parents occupied? What meaning would words like "drawing
room," "study," "bedroom," or "balcony" have for her? How would
she relate to stories of people living in houses? Maybe her parents would
try to explain. They once lived in a house that had rooms.

In the evening I called my father and told him about the meeting.
He was silent for a long time. I thought I heard him crying. As if talking
to himself, he said, "Those were great days, son. Her family was like my
own. I did all the chores when she and Avatar were getting married. I
have not seen her for years. Tell her I will."

Finally, one morning I boarded a jeep in Anantnag and, after eight
hours on a mountainous highway, reached Jammu.

The next morning I called a few acquaintances from my hotel room,
inquiring about my teacher. They could not help. The government lists
phone numbers, but they rarely work. I called; no response. Another
call; no response. On the fifth call, the recording said, "We are pleased
to receive your call. Your call is very important to us. Our operators will
soon assist you." "Soon" meant five long minutes before the phone disconnected.
I was used to it.

I paced around the room and called again. The phone beeped, and I
heard a man's voice, a real operator. "Can I have Chaman Lal Kantroo's
number? He lives in Amphalla." I heard typing. "Take down the number,"
he told me. I stared at the phone number on my pad, pulled myself
together, and punched in the number. His wife answered the phone. She
remembered me; I could talk to my teacher if I called after ten minutes. I
did, and he picked up the phone. His voice was hoarse, tired. He did not
seem well. "Can I come to see you, sir?" "Get here before ten," he said.
"I have an appointment with my doctor at ten-thirty." He coughed and
gave me directions. It was nine-thirty.

I rushed to the road and grabbed a rickshaw. The driver sped through
bazaars, crossed a few flyovers, shot up a slope, turned onto a lane, and
stopped. We were at the landmark, a jail, in fifteen minutes. I sought
directions for a local writer's white bungalow. A narrow, empty lane
took me there. A vegetable seller pointed out the house. From the writer's
house, I had to take the first lane on the left; my teacher lived in the
first house. It was a run-down yellow-painted brick house. The doorbell
did not work. I knocked. A girl opened the door. "I do not know any
Kantroos. There is a Kashmiri Pandit family living on the top floor. That
might be them." She disappeared behind a curtain on the ground floor.

A steep stair led to the rooftop. Behind a curtain of clothes hanging
on a nylon rope was a garret. "Come in, Basharat," Mr. Kantroo called
out. He sat on a bed by the lone window of the room. We shook hands.
and he asked me to sit with him on the bed, I looked at him; he had
aged. His cheeks had sunk deep, his hair was almost white, and his black
mustache was missing. His eyebrows were still bushy and black; his eyes
were still deep brown but seemed to have lost their verve. I saw in them
resignation and fatigue. He broke the silence to ask me about my life and
work, about the other students in my class.

I answered while running my gaze over a blue plastic bowl, a razor,
and a cup of shaving cream lying on a newspaper in front of him. Some
of my fellow students were doctors, some were biochemists, some were
lawyers, some were engineers, and some were dead. Paint was flaking
from the walls, and the fan overhead moved noisily. I wanted to ask him
what had forced him to leave Kashmir twelve years after the conflict
started. I remember the new school principal talking about a "problem"
he had. I could not ask.

His wife, who had helped him run the school, joined us. We talked
about Kashmir. I had forgotten my teacher was a poet, too. When I was
about to leave. I asked about his writing: "I am not writing much nowadays.
I did write when I was in Kashmir. A collection of poems was
published in 2002." His eyes sparkled again. "But the collection is not
with the booksellers. I could not accept their terms. Mostly friends and
acquaintances come and take a copy."

"But we need to read your poems." I protested. "You cannot hide
them from the world."

He smiled, indifferent to publishing advances. "Turn around and pick
a copy from the shelf." I held a lean hardbound monograph in my hands
The cover read: _Eternal Sin_. I left my poet-teacher.

Near the jail, I noticed an empty tea stall and found a seat in a corner.
I opened the book dedicated to the "non-beings of the world." I turned
a page: the tea-stall owner brought me a glass full of tea. I read the poem
"Innocuous Innocent." describing a dying man:

>A bloodstained label
>
>Stuck to his lapel
>
>Reads: In ...
>
>Does it mean "Indian, Informer, Intruder, Insurgent"?
>
>It bewilders to make it read "Innocuous Innocent."

I saw the dead: Prem Nath Bhat, my father's friend and a bright Pandit
lawyer of Anantnag, shot by militants; Abdul Sattar Ranjoor, a leftist
poet from Kulgam, slain before he could write a dissenting poem;
Zahoor Dalal, a shopkeeper on an evening walk, thrust into a police
van, shot, and dressed in the camouflage of an intruder/insurgent. Journalists
rushing back and forth in taxis, typing on their battered computer
terminals the words: _INNOCUOUS INNOCENT_.

Another poem was titled "Handcuffed Wishes." I remembered our
last conversation in Kantroo's office in Kashmir. "People talk about
nothing but death. Talk about life, talk about books." I had found my
answers in his verse. I left the tea stall and walked amid heavy traffic,
indifferent to the world, holding the book in a close grip.

Kantroo had told me Vinod's family lived in a place called Palora. I
called information again. I asked for his father and got the number. His
mother told me he worked in Delhi. Vinod had trained as an engineer
and worked for an air-conditioning company. His mother barely knew
the name; she did not have his number or office address. She told me he
was planning to join another company. I left my phone number with
her; she promised to pass it on to Vinod.

After all these years of going separate ways and failing to keep in
touch, I was impatient. I searched the company name on the Internet,
which gave me an address. I looked at the computer screen in disbelief.
It was a block away from my office in Delhi. We had worked a block away
from each other and never met. Maybe we had and did not recognize
our adult faces. I wondered how many times we had passed each other,
along with a thousand other office workers. I loved Delhi for the anonymity
it provided; I also hated it for that very quality. I rushed back to
the phone booth and called the engineering company in Vasant Vihar.
The receptionist's cordial voice said, "I am sorry, sir. He does not work
with us anymore. He has taken up another job."

I returned to Srinagar, having lost the trail. One afternoon I walked
into my usual cybercafé. I waited on a gaudy sofa for my turn. A remixed
version of the latest Bollywood hit blared from an invisible speaker. I
tried reading a few days' old newspaper lying on a table. A young man
with black hair parted sideways over his narrow forehead walked in.
He seemed vaguely familiar. We looked at each other in a moment of
knowing and not knowing.

"Vikas!"

"Basharat!"

"God! It is you!"

I had last seen him as a small boy standing next to Vinod in an old
school photograph. Vikas and I had competed for the attentions of a
classmate in a childhood romance that never was. Vikas, too, had
migrated with his family to Jammu in the early nineties. We had lost
touch. He was now a sales manager for a pharmaceutical company, in
Srinagar to make an assessment of their sales. He was staying in a hotel
on the Dal Lake. I said, "You have to come home, Vicky! To hell with the
hotel!"

"I would love to, but I am leaving in two hours. Have an afternoon
flight to catch, just dropped in to shoot an e-mail to my office."

We talked about our families. Neither of us mentioned anything
about the conflict; it seemed remote from a chance meeting of two
friends after fifteen years. He asked about our Muslim friends and classmates;
I asked about our Pandit friends. He had lost touch with most. We
shared a cigarette and laughed about things from our childhood.

An hour later, I walked past Polo View toward the Zero Bridge,
beyond which I was staying in a southern area of Srinagar. Strains of a
song playing on a radio escaped from a solitary bunker near the bridge.
A lonely-looking soldier stood behind a machine gun. The setting
sun shone in the green water of the Jhelum; its last rays reddened the
horizon. I thought of my grandmother telling me as a child, "When an
innocent man is killed, the sky turns red." An innocent man had died in
Kashmir almost every day after the winter of 1990.
