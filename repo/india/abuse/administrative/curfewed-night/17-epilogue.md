## Epilogue

The car drove slowly toward the Srinagar airport. I was leaving
again, carrying with me the furniture for a new life and a new
room I had yet to find. We drove out of the city, past bunkers,
soldiers, guns, loops of barbed wire, pedestriansw raising hands
and identity cards; honking cars and local buses; boys and girls in uniforms
outside schools; competing posters of politicians making promises;
shopkeepers yawning behind counters and unsold things; houses of
friends and strangers; and then the heavily barricaded airport complex
gate. After a few metal detectors and body searches, I walked into the
decrepit waiting hall. I felt as if an iron hand had taken me in its grip and
pulled me from my soil.

The journey was not over; it will never be. The sky has been red, the
days fear-filled, and the nights curfewed since 1990. In that season, I was
fourteen and enthralled by the heady slogans of freedom, by tales of dangerous
treks through the border snows, by the naive hope of a new world
about to be born. I left Kashmir, grew up, found and quit a job. I came
back. I heard and remembered stories of brutality, courage, love, hatred,
faith, loss, and even hope. Both Kashmir and I had changed. The heady,
rebellious Kashmir I left as a teenager was now a land of brutalized,
exhausted, and uncertain people. I was now in my late twenties, already
old. The conflict might leave the streets, but it will not leave the soul.

Mini-tractors carried the luggage to the plane on the tarmac. Workers
in blue overalls began loading the bags and briefcases. The certainty
of departure pierced me. I knew I would return, leave, return, leave, and
return again. The plane took off after a violent sprint on the runway.
Houses grew smaller, paddies turned into neat green squares, metaled
roads connecting villages shrank into black lines, and the coquettish
clouds took new shapes. I turned away from the window. The poet had
lied about paradise.

Delhi, too, hadn't changed much. The landlords still said, "You are like
our own son. Give us a call on Sunday." And friends said, "Stay with
us!" I began writing and rewriting in a rented room in a slumlike area
populated by students, writers, and friends. I worked at a newsmagazine
during the day and wrote and rewrote about Kashmir at night. Newspapers
in Srinagar continued printing some headlines in red. And people
were talking about the bus. India and Pakistan had agreed to open a bus
service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad. After fifty-eight years, a bus
would cross the _Line of Control_ and divided families would be allowed
to visit each other. "Historic" and "hope" became oft-used words.

In the first week of April 2005, I returned home to report. Manmohan
Singh and Pervez Musharaf shook hands on billboards in Srinagar.
Kashmiris debated the difference the _trans-LoC_ bus would make. Some
equated it with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Some were more restrained
and saw it as a step toward resolving the Kashmir dispute. Some militant
groups saw it as a distraction from the real resolution of the dispute and
threatened to attack the bus. Reporters looked for people who had families
on the other side of the _Line of Control_, for people who had crossed
the _Line of Control_, for people who had seen the _Line of Control_, for
people who had thought about the _Line of Control_.

I was talking to some people in a coffeehouse near Lal Chowk when
gunfire slashed the air. Militants opposing the bus had launched a suicide
attack at the nearby Tourist Reception Center, adjacent to a cricket
stadium where the bus service would be inaugurated the next day. Vans
carrying television crews rushed toward the Tourist Center like wailing
ambulances. Paramilitaries and police cordoned off the green-painted
building that housed many offices. A gun battle followed, and in a few
minutes, the wooden Tourist Center was burning.

I hid behind a police vehicle across the road from the burning building
with a group of reporters. Bursts of gunfire made us duck to the
ground, stay close together. A few minutes later, an elderly man in a
brown suit jumped out of a first-floor window of the building and ran
across the road. A reporter reached out and brought him to our group.
He was Mohammed Ashraf, a manager for an airline, and had been working
out of the Tourist Reception Center for years. He watched the dark
smoke, the hellish flames, and the pieces of burned office files rise above
the crumbling roof of his office. "I need to call my family," he said. "No!
I need to call Atta first," he added almost immediately. His colleague
Atta was trapped inside. An American correspondent gave him her
phone. Ashraf dialed and dialed again, but the networks were jammed.
He stayed with us for a long time, watching the building crumble and
scared hordes of pigeons circle it from a distance.

The next morning, on my way to the cricket stadium to watch the
inaugural ceremony, I passed the burned Tourist Reception Center. Piles
of charcoal, ash, and rubble rested on its stony plinth. Leftovers of its
charred columns were still smoldering. I walked ahead, past the stiff soldiers.
In the cricket stadium, a police band played a Kashmiri folk song
made famous by its Bollywood version. It was drizzling. Manmohan
Singh made a speech and thanked Pervez Musharraf for making the bus
service possible. Singh waved a blue flag, and the Srinagar--Muzaffarabad
bus drove out of the stadium amid applause from the modest crowd,
strengthened by the presence of a few hundred recruits from the local
police in civvies, whose regulation haircuts betrayed their true identity.

The bus drove toward the _Line of Control_, 140 kilometers north of
Srinagar. A caravan of journalists followed it. We drove past hundreds
of helmets and guns and climbed many mountains. We saw the Jhelum,
a hundred feet wide, mighty and green, roaring through the mountains
despite the two countries controlling its banks, announcing its
freedom. And then, after all these years, I saw it: the _Line of Control_. A
loopy razor-wire fence snaked through wild bushes and the greens of
the rather barren mountain with a few mud houses. This razor wire, this
mountain, was the _Line of Control_. Two girls playing outside a tiny mud
house on the other bank waved at us. We waved back.

Passengers were to cross the _LoC_ at Kaman Post, a military post
where Indian and Pakistani soldiers faced each other from the two banks
of a stream. The bridge over the stream at Kaman Post was destroyed in
1948 during the first India--Pakistan war. Now, with the peace process,
the burned Kaman Bridge had been rebuilt. Indians had wanted to paint
it in the colors of the Indian flag; Pakistanis had objected. They agreed
on white, the color of peace, and rechristened it the Peace Bridge. On
the Peace Bridge, too, control seemed to be the key word, despite the
India-Pakistan bonhomie. An Indian army officer told me that two thirds
of the Peace Bridge was Indian and the other third was Pakistani. This
two-thirds Indian and one-third Pakistani bridge was the _line of control_;
the shallow stream passing under it was the _line of control_. By evening
thirty-nine Kashmiris from opposing sides of the border dividing
Kashmir had walked across the bridge, the fifty-eight years of history of
Indian and Pakistan, and the fifty-eight years of the division of Kashmir
in 1947.

Sharif Hussein Bukhari was one of those men. In his early sixties, a
beak-nosed man with soft eyes, wearing a light blue _salwar kameez_, he
walked in a daze as he crossed the bridge from the Pakistani-controlled
part into the Indian-controlled part, where he was born. He was returning
home for the first time since 1950. Crossing the _LoC_ had haunted him
throughout the five decades he spent in Pakistan, as a student, a lawyer,
a Lahore high-court judge, and now a professor of law. His two sisters
and brother had stayed in his ancestral North Kashmir village when he
trekked with his father across the _LoC_ as a fifteen-year-old. For years
he neither received nor sent any letters home. There were no phone
calls, either. He communicated through his dreams. "I would dream of
my school, of the apricot and the apple trees in our courtyard. I would
dream of the house I was born in and of the journey back home," he said.
The crossing had been unattainable even in his dreams. "In my dreams I
would be arrested at the _LoC_ and turned back," he said.

That failure of the subconscious was the border. The _line of control_
did not run through 576 kilometers of militarized mountains. It ran
through our souls, our hearts, and our minds. It ran through everything
a Kashmiri, an Indian, and a Pakistani said, wrote, and did. It ran through
the fingers of editors writing newspaper and magazine editorials, it ran
through the eyes of reporters, it ran through the reels of Bollywood
coming to life in dark theaters, it ran through conversations in coffee
shops and on television screens showing cricket matches, it ran through
families and dinner talk, it ran through whispers of lovers. And it ran
through our grief, our anger, our tears, and our silence.

Hundreds of villagers had gathered at the Reception Center for the
visitors from Pakistani-administered Kashmir at Salamabad village,
half an hour from the Peace Bridge, as you drive back toward Srinagar.
Schoolchildren dressed in traditional costumes, who had waited
throughout the day for the bus to arrive, welcomed it by dancing to Bollywood
songs. A young man rushed toward Bukhari. Bukhari didn't recognize
the excited youth. "I am Showket, your sister's son," said the
young man. "I am sorry, son. I didn't even get to see a picture of yours
all these years," Bukhari said. Their moist eyes were the _line of control_.

The buses carrying the passengers from Muzaffarabad traveled under
a drizzly gray sky to Srinagar. It was a road that had been deserted after
dusk for a decade and a half. I watched thousands of women, men, and
children stand along the soldier-laden road, welcoming the ones who
had stepped across the line. There was no fear that evening. There were
only hands reaching out of the bus windows, waving in the air, as if each
wave would erase the lines of control.
