## Heroes

Winter was setting in. The last leaf had fallen from the mulberry
tree outside my window, and the clouds were a dull,
wintry gray. Srinagar seemed to have shrunk, turned more
introspective, like a middling man noticing yet another shock of gray
hair in the morning mirror. The desolation outside mirrored my desolation
inside. I spent my afternoons reading and tried to write in the evenings.
But I had no distance from the experiences I was trying to process
and shape into words. I sulked, turned irritable, and had pointless arguments
with friends. I called Shahid. We met in our favorite caf√© near the
city center. "It is common among people who come into contact with
trauma victims," Shahid said, and suggested I should try not to write for
a few weeks.

"That won't help. I have to finally get back to writing it down."

"Then remember that people like you and me are a privileged minority
in Kashmir. Our backgrounds have shielded us from a lot. We have
been able to get an education and build a career. We can get out of here
whenever we want to." He paused and said, "Didn't you leave?" Shahid
had never left Kashmir. He had studied at the medical college in Srinagar.
His remark felt like an allegation.

"I came back, Shahid. I did not forget anything when I was away. I
came back to write about Kashmir," I shouted.

"Then face it! Don't run away every time you hear stories that depress
you," he retorted. We smoked our cigarettes and drank our coffee without
any words. After a few minutes, he stamped out his cigarette and
said, "I am sorry. I know it is hard. I couldn't even get Hussein to speak
to me about his problems. I am the doctor here. But I was talking as a
friend."

We ordered more coffee, and Shahid continued to talk. "It happens to
everyone who had strong attachments to this place. When I was posted
in the emergency ward, they used to bring scores of injured every day.
At times we were able to save them. At times they died on the operating
table. I used to cry in my room after every such death. It affected my
work. I wanted to be transferred and talked to a senior doctor about it.
He told me that we must know that we can't save everyone, and yet we
must try to be better doctors." Shahid had faced his fear and continued
to work in the emergency ward. I had to confront my own ghosts.

I walked back to my parents' house, thinking once again about people
I had failed to write about, places I had postponed visiting because I
feared it would be painful. I thought of Mubeena Ghani, a woman from
a South Kashmir village an hour away from my ancestral home whom I
had heard about while I was in school. In May 1990, a few hours after her
marriage, she was raped by a group of Indian paramilitary soldiers.

Later, in college, I read the short stories of Saadat Hussein Manto,
the greatest chronicler of violence on the subcontinent. Manto wrote a
series of very powerful sketches about the sectarian violence that followed
the partition of British India into India and Pakistan. In one story,
"_Khol Do_" (Open Up), he talks about a father finding his daughter in
a hospital ward a few days after she's gone missing during the sectarian
violence. The doctor in the ward asks the father to open a window
for his daughter. When she hears the doctor's phrase _khol do_, the daughter
drops her pants. She had been repeatedly raped and associated the
phrase _khol do_ with the rapist's command to undress.

In the spring of 2002, I had traveled to Kashmir on a reporting trip
from Delhi. One day after I had filed my news reports, I went in search
of Mubeena. I found out that she and her husband, Rashid Malik, lived in
the village of Chawalgam, an hour away from my village. The next morning
I took a taxi to Chawalgam. In the village market, shops hung placards
advertising Coke and Parle biscuits. A shopkeeper directed me up a
narrow alley that ended with a bakery. The baker was kneading dough in
a wide wooden tub. "Where does Rashid Malik live?" I asked.

The baker stopped and said without taking his hands off the dough,
"Do you mean the one whose bride was raped? Are you from the press?"
He pointed to a hutlike house of unbaked bricks and wood. Rusted
barbed wire nailed to poles of willow branches formed its boundary.
Polythene sheets took the place of window glass, and haystacks placed
on rough timber lofts formed the roof. A brown cow was tied in the
courtyard corner, and a child played with twigs on the stairs. I stood
outside the house; I felt like a trespasser and wondered whether I should
leave them undisturbed. I was debating the thought when a haggard-looking
man appeared.

Shadows circled his sunken eyes, stubble with dashes of white covered
his sallow cheeks, and his shirt hung loose on his bony shoulders.
"I am Rashid. The shopkeepers told me a journalist was looking for me.
Please come home."

He led me to his house. The mud walls of the house were cracked
and the bare bricks exposed. A patchwork blanket covered the floor in
the drawing room, which didn't have any furniture. His son left to call
Mubeena from the fields where she was working. I talked to Rashid till
Mubeena came. Her pale skin seemed to hang lifelessly on her oval face;
the skin on her hands was cracked, and her brown eyes were reluctant
and apprehensive. She wore a battered _pheran_ and brought tea and biscuits
for me. Rashid was apologetic for not being able to offer me anything
better. Mubeena poured tea for me in a cracked porcelain cup, and
they told me their story.

On the evening of May 16, 1990, Rashid Malik got a haircut and
dressed in a white suit and an embroidered turban. The village girls sang
marriage songs. In their songs, the groom was a prince and his bride
a princess prettier than the moon. His family hired a photographer to
take pictures of the marriage ceremony. One of those pictures shows
Rashid leaving for his bride's house. His dark brown eyes gleam in his
ruddy face. His wide shoulders and muscular chest fill the jacket. His
teeth shine beneath his thick black mustache. Another picture shows
him sitting on the front seat of the bus hired to take him, his friends, and
relatives to Mubeena's house in Hiller village, five miles away. The bus
left at nine in the evening. Half an hour later, Rashid sat on a velvet-covered
seat in his bride's house. A mullah arrived, and the Muslim marriage
ritual, the _nikah_, was performed. Three times the mullah asked Rashid
if he was willing to marry Mubeena of his free will, and three times he
asked Mubeena if she was willing to marry Rashid of her free will. Both
agreed and became husband and wife. The families celebrated, and the
feast was served. An hour later, Rashid prepared to leave with his bride.
More songs were sung. Then they heard gunfire.

Rashid's in-laws believed it was the militants firing in the air. In those
days militants would order people not to sing marriage songs or have
lavish feasts in a time of sacrifice. Rashid and his relatives insisted on
leaving. The bride's family was worried and asked them to stay put. They
argued about the wisdom of traveling five miles at that time of night. The
groom's side prevailed, boarded the bus, and left with the bride. Rashid's
elder brother, who worked for the Indian Railway Police Force, sat next
to him, carefully holding a travel permission slip acquired from an army
colonel posted nearby. Those were the days of night curfews in Kashmir.
Every man moving around after dusk needed a curfew pass. The bus
moved slowly on the dirt track that led to the groom's village.

Two kilometers on, Rashid, who sat in the front seat next to the
driver, saw a Central Reserve Police Force vehicle. The bus stopped,
and his brother showed the CRPF men the permission slip. They let
the marriage party proceed. A few miles ahead, at a crossing in Hakoorah
village, Rashid and his companions saw soldiers from the Border
Security Force, who an hour ago had come across a patrol party of the
CRPF. The paramilitary groups had mistaken each other for militants and
exchanged fire. The bus stopped again. The BSF personnel ran toward
it. A BSF man shouted at the driver to switch off the headlights. Darkness
fell on the road, and a few miniature decorative bulbs lighted the
bus. Rashid, his companions, and his bride shivered in their seats. His
brother rose, permission slip in hand, and opened the door. He moved
toward a BSF officer to show him the piece of paper. The BSF men did
not even look at the slip. Rashid saw two of them grab his brother by
the neck and drag him to the roadside, where they began beating him.
Rashid wanted to protest or beg for mercy, but his feet failed him. He
saw the BSF men circle the bus; he looked over his shoulder at his bride.
She huddled in her seat with the bridesmaid; he wanted to rush to her.
But then there was gunfire.

The BSF men poured bullets into the bus. Rashid threw off his turban
and ducked under his seat like all the others. The next moment he
felt something grazing his shoulder, and a cry rose from the next seat.
The bullet grazing his shoulder had hit his cousin Sabzaar in the arm.
Another volley of bullets pierced the tin body of the bus and his cousin
Asadullah's chest, killing him. Rashid was yet to realize what had happened
to his cousin when he was hit in the back; doctors later found
five bullets. Three bullets hit Mubeena in her shoulder, back, and hips.
The BSF officer ordered the passengers off the bus; a round of mass beatings
followed. Rashid fell on the road and lost consciousness. Mubeena
stood along with her bridesmaid and others by the roadside, bleeding.
A group of soldiers dragged her and the bridesmaid to the mustard fields
beside the road. An unknown number of BSF men raped the two injured
women. "I could not even remember how many there were. I had lost
my senses," Mubeena said.

Another group of BSF personnel led by a senior officer reached the
place. They took the injured men and women to a hospital in Anantnag.
The next morning the state government officials reached the hospital
and took the statements of Rashid, Mubeena, and the other injured. The
district administration head awarded them state relief of three thousand
rupees each. They refused. Separatist leaders visited them in the hospital
and later in their village, where they addressed the villagers and urged
them to stand by the couple.

Rashid was shifted to a better hospital in Srinagar. The doctors gave
him a choice: Live with the five bullets in your body or risk a surgery
that can take your mobility. He decided against the surgery and returned
home, determined to begin his life anew. A hostile silence greeted
Rashid and Mubeena on their return. For Rashid's family and the villagers,
Mubeena was a bad omen: the cause of a misfortune that had taken
one life and injured ten. Her in-laws rejected her. Mubeena's parents and
some friends stood by the couple. Rashid could not work for a year; the
couple lived on help provided by Mubeena's parents. He wanted to sell
his share in the family property. His family denied him even that.

A year later, Mubeena gave birth to a son; the child died in a few
weeks. She was suicidal. Rashid begged her to live, to be stronger. Leaving
his trauma behind, he took up work as a carpenter when there was
work. On other days Rashid was a manual laborer, carrying bricks, plowing
fields, harvesting crops. Mubeena pitched in; she stitched, tailored,
and worked at the village farms, braving taunts thrown by her in-laws,
neighbors, and village folk. At the village tap, waiting in the queue for
water, she lowered her head. On the streets of the village, she moved like
smoke, trying to be invisible. The smallest altercation would become a
reminder of her trauma. "Aren't you the bride who was raped? Aren't
you the one who brought ill luck?" The village had nicknames for them.
"They call us 'Crossfire Bride' and 'Crossfire Groom,'" Mubeena told me.

An inquiry was ordered; some paramilitary soldiers were suspended.
New personnel took their place: soldiers who did not recognize Rashid
and Mubeena. But she still shivered at the sight of a uniform.

That night lingered like a ghost, refusing to be exorcised. Mubeena
poured tea for me and wiped her tears with her scarf. Rashid was silent.
I stared at a faded design of flowers on the patchwork blanket we sat on.
Their daughter came in and relieved us of that difficult silence. She wore
a white-and-blue uniform and carried a satchel. She rushed to Mubeena
and sat on her lap. The girl was a fourth-grader at a local school. She
showed me her notebooks. In her English notebook, she had written
about her aim in life: to be a doctor. Rashid and Mubeena looked at
her with pride. I looked out the window; a wind rustled the willows
behind the house and flapped the polythene sheet nailed to the bare
window panels. Rashid and Mubeena walked me to the door. Rashid
held his daughter's hand, and their son clung to Mubeena. They waved
and smiled.

Sometime after meeting them, I came across a poem by a Kashmiri
poet, Farooq Nazki:

>Mothers wash the bloodstained apparel of grooms
>
>On stream banks,
>
>Bridal wear burns to ash,
>
>Bridesmaids cry
>
>And the Jhelum flows.

But I failed to get myself to write about Mubeena and Rashid. I had
failed also to visit Kunan Poshpora, the village in the northern Kupwara
district where the Indian army raped more than twenty women in 1990.
Kunan Poshpora had become a symbol, a metaphor, a memory like Srebrenica.

In early December I arrived in Kupwara, three hours from Srinagar.
Kunan Poshpora was minutes away, and I planned to catch a bus to
finally visit it. Majestic mountains and miles of lush green paddy fields
surrounded Kupwara. Its beautiful surroundings heightened the squalor
of the town. The shared taxi I boarded in Srinagar stopped in a vast,
unpaved bus yard that marked the beginnings of the town. Two rows of
cramped and ugly blocks of shops formed the main market. Eateries displaying
potato chip packets and bottles of Pepsi stood next to mechanic
shops smelling of petrol. I saw an army check post and the barrel of a
machine gun poking out of it. A sign hanging on the check post read:
_TOWN COMMANDER KUPWARA_. The military presence around the town justified
the title.

Then I heard a boy in clothes blackened with grease shout, "Kunan
Poshpora." A green-and-yellow-painted bus revved its engine. An old
man with a scraggly beard, wearing a peasant's embroidered cap, tied
two long iron pipes used for water supply to the roof of the bus. Three
women sat on the seat behind the driver. A plump girl in a yellow dress
and green bangles jumped restlessly in the aisle, chewed gum, and blew
bubbles. A couple cuddled on a seat. The conductor shouted, "Kunan
Poshpora." The driver revved the engine again. The couple continued
their whispers. Two schoolboys in white shirts and black trousers
jumped onto the bus, and it began to leave. I watched it to go and thought
of Rashid, Mubeena, and their daughter who wanted to be a doctor.

I sat in, a run-down tea shop, smoking, thinking. But I couldn't be
alone for too long. Shabir, an effeminate young man who said he was a
poet, introduced himself and asked what I was doing in Kupwara. I told
him I found escape in journalism. "I thought so. I could tell from your
bag, your notebooks. Most journalists dress like you do," said Shabir. He
loved watching television news and had ideas for me. "I can take you
some places you might like to write about," he said. "The first news I can
give you is about a graveyard here. Most people buried there are the boys
who were killed in encounters with the army on the border."

The _Line of Control_ ran through many mountains towering over the
villages bordering Kupwara. Shabir told me that after every encounter,
the bodies of the youths trying to cross over to Pakistan for arms training
or returning from there were handed over by the Indian army to the
local police and then buried in the graveyard. "Because nobody knows
the names of the dead, the locals who manage the graveyard have marked
them with numbers."

"What was the latest number you saw there?" I asked him.

"I think it was two hundred something."

"I will go there soon," I lied. I thanked Shabir and left the caf√©. I
was tired and boarded a taxi headed for Srinagar. I wanted to be home. I
wanted to be in my room.
