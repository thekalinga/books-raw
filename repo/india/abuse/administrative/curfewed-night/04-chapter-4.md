## Bunkeristan

Over the next few months, there were various crackdowns in
my village and the neighboring villages. More Indian military
camps were being set up in Kashmir. Military vehicles,
armed soldiers, machine guns poking out of sandbag bunkers were
everywhere; death and fear became routine, like going to school or
playing cricket and football. At times we forgot about the war around us;
at times we could not.

In the summer of 1992, my aunt was pregnant, and Mother constantly
worried about a militant attack or a crackdown in our village. "What
will we do if something happens?" she often mumbled. One June afternoon,
my aunt's labor pains began. Her husband, Bashir (the uncle with
the mysterious English accent), Grandfather, and Mother talked about
moving her to the hospital in Anantnag. But there was a general strike,
or _hartal_, that day to protest something --- a very frequent occurrence
those days. The shops were closed, and there were no vehicles on the
roads. Neighborhood boys played cricket with a tennis ball on the road.
There was no way to get to the hospital but to persuade one of the two
taxi drivers in the village to drive my aunt there. Grandfather found
Dilawar Khan, one of the two drivers. Uncle Bashir, Mother, and Grandfather
were accompanying my aunt to the hospital. As they began to
leave, an acquaintance arrived on his scooter and asked them to wait.

Militants had attacked a military convoy near the hospital in Anantnag,
and an intense gun battle was being fought. My aunt was in great
pain. Mother tried to calm her. Uncle Bashir walked in and out of the
house nervously. Grandfather prayed.

After a while, we could not wait any longer. Mother and Uncle sat
with my aunt in the backseat of the taxi. Grandfather sat in the front
seat. Dilawar, the tall, bald driver, sat behind the wheel, solemn and purposeful.
He revved up the engine and turned to Grandfather. "Masterji,
she is my daughter, too. Even if they have brought out tanks, I will get
her to the hospital." The cricket players left their game and stood by the
car. Almost everyone in the neighborhood had assembled to see them
off. Children tried to get closer to the car windows and see her. Women
reached through to pat her head and hold her hand. Men made noises
about hurrying up and being brave and patient. The car drove away.
Scores of hands rose and a chorus of voices broke into prayer: _Miyon Khoday
Thaeyinav Salamat! Miyon Nabi Kariney Raecchih_! (May Allah keep you safe!
May Muhammad guard you!)

Three hours later, Dilawar pulled up outside our house. "It is a boy!"
he shouted.

I shook his hand. "Is my aunt all right?"

"Yes, yes, she is fine. I drove really fast. And at the check posts, I
called every soldier 'Major sahib' and told them the girl was about to
give birth. After all, even they are human beings. We got there on time."
I thanked him, and he smiled. "She is like my own daughter. It is a beautiful
boy!" We named the boy Murtaza --- the brave one.

One autumn day a few months later, I was with a few friends in the
small market near my house. A patrol walked in, and our hands went to
our pockets for our identity cards. A soldier stopping near you meant
trouble. It meant an identity check, a possible beating, or a visit to the
nearest army camp. Or he might simply order you to carry a bag of
supplies to his camp. Soldiers forcing civilians to work for them was
common.

The soldier who walked toward my friends and me only wanted to
purchase batteries for his radio. I directed him to the shop of Bashir Lala,
my mother's second cousin, a good-natured man somewhat famous in
the extended family for his cowardice; we often sought a laugh at his
expense.

One day Bashir was visiting relatives in Anantnag. The locals mostly
referred to Anantnag by its traditional name, Islamabad. The soldiers
would beat anyone who used Islamabad, as it was also the name of the
Pakistani capital. Bashir had been reminding himself to say Anantnag
and not Islamabad if a soldier asked where he was headed. His bus was
stopped at a check post outside the town, and a soldier demanded,
"Where are you going?"

Bashir forgot his rehearsed answer, "Islamabad." The soldier's baton
stung his left arm, and Bashir cried out, "Anantnag, sir! Anantnag, not
Islamabad."

It was rumored that Bashir took the next bus home and visited neither
Anantnag nor Islamabad for the next few months.

The soldier wanting batteries took the few steps to Bashir's shop. I
saw Bashir rise from his wooden seat and walk to the stairs leading to
the shop, sweating and shivering. He addressed the soldier. "Sir! What
have I done? Do not believe these idiots, they have no other work but
to tease me. I am their father's age, and still they scare me. I am only a
small shopkeeper." The soldier laughed and asked for batteries. Bashir
fumbled through the few wooden shelves of his shop, found nothing,
and apologized again. "You should keep batteries here," the soldier said.
Bashir said, "What brand, sir?"

The soldier moved on to another shop. Bashir watched the column
of soldiers till they disappeared. Only then did he dare to shout: "You
swine! You joke with me! You dogs!" He kept shouting at us. Then he hid
his head between his knees, covered it with his hands, and broke down.
"Why do you do this to me? I have a heart problem, and these guns terrify
me. Yes, I am a coward. I don't want to die. I have two daughters. I
have to marry them off before I die." He held his round, bald head and
cried. "You, too! And you are my sister's son," he said, looking directly
into my eyes.

I soon understood his fear better. One winter night my younger
brother Wajahat and I were watching _The Three Musketeers_. War or peace,
one couldn't let a chance to watch a movie slip by. Pakistan Television
screened clean versions of various Hollywood classics. The reception
on our television was bad, so Wajahat and I would spend hours adjusting
the antennae. I would carry the antennae attached to a wooden staff
from our roof to the lawn, to the cowshed, revolving it slowly. Wajahat
would run breathlessly between the drawing room and my position
to report the progress. Sometimes the TV would catch the images, but
the sound would be muffled with static; sometimes we could get clear
sound, and people would appear on the screen as if in a negative. Eventually,
we would come upon the right place for the antennae, and the
image and sound would synch up.

I lowered the volume to a bare minimum, lit a night lamp, and
lowered the curtains to avoid attracting any attention. Outside, the
curfewed night lay in silence like a man waiting in ambush. _The Three Musketeers_
fought, frolicked, and entertained us for a while. Then the rumble
of military trucks outside blurred the duels. We switched off the TV
and peeped through the curtains; the headlights of the trucks lit up the
empty road and the surrounding houses. After the convoy had passed,
there was silence, and a wistful moon reclined on clouds.

Morning came abruptly, with a loud announcement over the
mosque's public announcement system: "_Asalam-u-alikum_! This is an
urgent announcement. The army has cordoned off the village. Every man
and boy must assemble on the hospital lawns by six. It is a crackdown.
Every house will be searched. The women can stay at home." Gul Khan,
the farmer who lived in a hut of sun-baked bricks next to the mosque
and gave the call for prayer, repeated the announcement several times.
Few responded to his early-morning calls for prayer. But announcement
of the crackdown gave his voice a new power. Within minutes my family
had gathered in the kitchen. After a quick breakfast, Grandfather, Father,
my brother, and I stepped outside on the road. Small groups of men and
boys from our neighborhood were already standing by the closed storefronts.

Soon Mother and my aunts would be opening the doors of every
room and cupboard for the soldiers looking for militants, guns, or
ammunition. Kashmir was rife with stories of soldiers misbehaving with
women during crackdowns. But there was nothing we could do.

A small crowd of freshly washed faces began a reluctant journey
through the empty market toward the hospital compound. The light
mustard sun, half hidden behind the mountains, touched the tin roofs
of the houses. We walked in the misty light between rows of soldiers in
greenish metal helmets cradling assault rifles and machine guns, past the
forlorn shops. I reluctantly followed my father. Soldiers barked at us to
walk faster. We obeyed. Another group asked us to pull out our identity
cards and raise our hands. Within seconds, a long queue formed at the
hospital gate. Two parallel lines of raised hands, the right hand holding
firm to the identity card a few inches higher than the empty left hand.
There was no distinction between the farmhand and the judge, just one
man behind the other.

I entered the hospital compound, where several hundred men
were sitting on the cold, bare hospital ground. Father, Grandfather,
my brother, and I sat with a group of our neighbors. A military officer
ordered visiting relatives and guests to stand in a group away from the
residents of the village. They were ordered to walk in a queue past an
armored car. Each man was asked to stop near the window and show his
face to the masked _mukhbir_, a Kashmiri man who had become a collaborator
and identified militants and their supporters.

Some _mukhbirs_ were suspected militants who had been beaten into
submission. Some were volunteers who worked for money. Some had
joined the troops to seek revenge on militants for the killing of a family
member. Some time ago, militants had taken an alleged _mukhbir_ to the
canal running along the mountain towering over our village and shot
him. They had thrown the injured man into the canal and left him to die.
Fortunately, the injured man, who turned out to be an unemployed former
student of my grandfather from a neighboring village, survived. Two
bullets had hit him near his neck, but the canal's cold water coagulated
his blood and saved him.

Over the next few hours we were told to form queues and walk
past the _mukhbir_. If the informer raised his hand, the soldiers pounced
upon the suspect and took him away for interrogation. My turn came.
My heart galloped, but I tried not to look nervous. The _mukhbir_ waited
for a moment and asked me to move on. But Manzoor, my neighbor's
sixteen-year-old son, was taken away for interrogation. His father used
to run a hotel at a nearby tourist resort. After the fighting began and the
tourists stopped coming to Kashmir, they locked up the hotel. His father
opened a grocery shop after modifying a room on the ground floor of
their house. Manzoor went to school, but on the frequent days of _hartals_
against an arrest, arson, or custodial killing by the soldiers, he manned
the shop when the schools remained closed. He was a gregarious and
talkative teenager. Occasionally, the militants passing by would stop to
buy something or simply sit and talk. Manzoor loved the attention and
being able to talk to many commanders. The army seemed to have heard
that the militants stopped by his shop.

I returned to my place on the lawns and sat near Father and Grandfather,
who were consoling Manzoor's distraught father. Then two
soldiers came toward us. "Is someone called Basharat Peer here? He
is a ninth-class student." They had the name of my school. I stood
up. "Come with us," one said. "But ... I am a student," I tried protesting.
"We know. We just need you to identify somebody," the
soldier said curtly. They walked toward the doctor's-residence-turned-interrogation
center. I followed them, not turning back to see how my
father or grandfather were reacting. We entered the three-room building.
I had been there many times to see the doctor, who was a family
friend. I was told to sit in the storeroom, and the soldiers slammed the
door behind me.

The room was empty and had a single window facing the village
mountain. I stood near the window and stared at the door. It was a plain
wooden door, painted in the regulation bluish-green of hospital buildings.
I stared at the door and looked at my watch. I turned to the window
and looked at the mountain, at the pine trees standing in bright morning
light, at the rough track skirting up the slope to the canal, and at the lone
old hut in the clearing beside the canal. I looked at my watch again and
turned toward the door. It stood still, wooden. I sat down on the floor
and stared at the door. I was somewhat numb. The anticipation of interrogation
is worse than the interrogation.

Loud cries and shrieks from the rooms next door startled me. Over
and over I heard the words: _Khodayo Bachaav_ (Save me, God!) and _Nahin
Pata, sir_! (I don't know, sir!). They were torturing the men and the boys
who had been taken away after the _mukhbir_ had pointed them out. I
thought of Manzoor. How would his reedy body endure anything?
I thought of the boy from my school whom they wanted me to identify.
I muttered all the prayers I had ever known. The door stood still.
I stared at the dusty bare floor and waited. The shrieks continued, with
brief intervals of silence.

Around two hours later, the door opened violently. Two soldiers
stood there with their guns pointed at me. I stood up. I was stiff, scared,
and staring into their faces. But they did not hit me. One of them began
questioning me.

"What is your name?"

"Basharat, sir!"

"Full name?"

"Basharat Ahmad Peer, sir!"

"Father's name?"

"Ghulam Ahmad Peer, sir!"

"What does he do?"

"Government officer, sir!" Quickly adding for the effect, hoping it
might help, "Kashmir Administrative Services officer, sir!"

He didn't seem to hear me.

"Where in the village do you live?"

"Down the road, sir! Next to the pharmacy."

I continued looking at him and then briefly at the other soldier. But
their stern, impassive faces gave away nothing.

Suddenly: "Which group are you with? KLF or HM?"

"With nobody, sir! I am a student."

He paused and looked at me.

"Everyone says he is a student. "How
many of your friends are with them?"

"None of my friends, sir! They are all students." I took out my student
identity card from my shirt pocket and presented it.

He scanned it, turned it around, and returned it.

"Where are the
weapons?"

"I have no weapons, sir! I am a student."

"Come on, tell us. You know we have other ways of finding out."

"I know, sir! But I am only a student!" I pleaded.

"Think harder. I will come back in a few minutes," said the interrogator,
and left.

The other soldier stood there in silence. I tried to persuade him that
I was merely a student. "Talk to the officer when he returns," he said,
and maintained his frightening silence. After a while, the interrogator
returned and asked the same questions again. I had the same answer:
"I am a student."

"All right," he said, "I know you are a student." He seemed to soften a
bit. He asked me about a student from my school who was still enrolled
but didn't come to school much. He was Pervez, my best friend from
school, bad singer of Bollywood songs, center forward on the football
team, and a boy with pink cheeks and a blue tracksuit. I answered
quickly and gave Pervez's father's name, profession, and the name of
their village. I also mentioned that he had relatives in our village. Pervez
had been visiting his relatives and had been arrested in the crackdown.
They had wanted to cross-check his identity. The interrogator looked at
me for a moment and said, "All right! You can leave."

I thanked him and walked out of the storeroom. I could feel hundreds
of curious, sympathetic eyes on my face. I became very self-conscious,
took measured steps, and tried to smile. Father and Grandfather rose
and walked toward me. I hugged them. "Did they beat you, Commander
in Chief?" Father tried to joke. Grandfather's eyes were moist; he threw
an arm around my shoulders and said nothing. After a while Manzoor
appeared, limping. Later, when the crackdown was lifted, my friend
from school was released as well. Pervez came limping toward me. We
hugged. I asked him to come home: "I have to get home. Thanks! You
saved me today." I watched him go, his cinnamon-checked shirt disappearing
in the crowd.

I never saw him again. A few years later, I heard that he had joined the
JKLF and was killed in a gun battle.

The day passed in a flurry of visits to the houses of men and boys
who had been arrested. Manzoor had bruises all over his body from the
beatings. His father forbade him from manning the grocery shop. Back
home, my family talked about the traces of mustache and beard that
had begun to grow on my face. The soldiers were particularly suspicious
of anyone with any kind of facial hair. Some of the older men of the
village --- including Manzoor's father --- who used to dye their hair black
had stopped. Gray hair made you less of a suspect. "This bit of beard is
not good for you," Father said to me. "You must shave." Grandfather
smiled. Mother laughed. I felt very shy. Father brought his shaving kit.
"Come, I will teach you. It is easy." I had always watched Father shave.
I stood in front of the bathroom mirror; he stood near me. I rinsed my
face with water and put some of his Old Spice shaving cream on a brush.
"Move the brush slowly in circles on the skin," Father said. Soon my face
disappeared in white lather. The entire family was watching me. Father
gave me his razor. "Glide it slowly. Don't press hard or you will cut yourself." I shaved.
