## Price of Life

Mubeena and Rashid had lived through brutality and ostracism,
yet they had made a home and were bringing up their
1 children. Parveena had moved on from being an anonymous
housewife to a celebrated crusader for justice. Tortured, broken
men like Ansar had built new lives. Hussein had begun the process of
discussing his problems with Shahid, and I had finally been able to write
about people, places, and subjects I had run away from. In those tales
shadowed by death and loss, there were also feats of resilience and fortitude.
Despite everything, people survived. Yet how many could really
move on?

It was early February. Winter was refusing to wear out; the mountains
were still frozen ash. My shoulders no longer felt the weight of multiple
layers of sweaters and a thick wool _pheran_. The beige weed frames of the
_kangris_ we carried all winter, even to our beds, had turned a dark brown
from long hours of intimacy with our hands. The soles of my shoes had
taken the color of mud despite the daily violence of a shoe brush. And
morning breath still imitated my cigarettes. Father wore his black Jinnah
cap and brown overcoat to work; Mother was mostly home, her school
closed for a two-and-a-half-month-long winter break. She suggested
that we visit a cousin of my father who was back from his pilgrimage to
Mecca.

Most Kashmiri Muslims looked forward to the pilgrimage to Mecca
for years. People went to work, built houses, educated their children,
married them off, and when their worldly duties were taken care of,
they took their savings, walked to the government office that issued Hajj
forms, and bought a ticket for Mecca. Traveling to Mecca is the only traveling
most Kashmiri Muslims do. The pilgrimage is mandatory for every
Muslim when he or she can afford to make it. My uncle was done with
his worldly duties when he and his wife left for Mecca. Now they were
back, and their journey had accorded them a new status: Hajjis. Kashmiri
tradition required friends and relatives to visit newly returned Hajjis.
The conflict, however, had limited mobility, and extended families met
only on major social occasions like engagements, weddings, hospital
visits, or funerals. "Your father can't come, so you have to come with me
to Uncle Rahman's house," my mother said.

Father used to visit my uncle and his family regularly despite the
strong presence of Indian troops and militants around my uncle's village.
But he had stopped after the mine attack. My parents still lived with
fear.

Some time ago we had been in his car when the driver drove over
an empty tetra packet of a mango drink lying on the road. As children,
we used to jump on those empty packets to make them burst like crackers.
My father had ducked under the seat, his hand covering his head.
"Daddy, it is a Frooti case," I said slowly. He'd eased back in his seat and
was silent. "You know, after that mine blast ..."

I had seen my father's helplessness another day when we heard the
news of the death of his aunt. She lived in a village close to my uncle's,
and Father had not been able to visit her during the last phase of her illness.
"She was very kind to me when I was a child. She always took care
of me, more than any relative I had," Father told me. "But I couldn't
even visit her when she was dying."

Mother and I boarded a local bus to visit my uncle's village. I was
excited to meet many of my relatives whom I hadn't seen in years. The
bus ambled along the slope of our mountains and stopped a mile ahead
for an identity check at one of the two military camps bordering our
village. Two very young soldiers in flak jackets stood at the checkpoint,
daintily dangling their Kalashnikovs. They asked us to walk. We walked
a hundred meters and a soldier shouted, "Stop." We stopped. Nobody
was frisked. No bags were searched. We boarded the bus and moved
toward the village. I wondered at the absurdity of these instructions.
They served no purpose, even when I looked at things from a soldier's
perspective. It felt like a video game. The soldier moves his finger; buses
stop; people form queues, walk, stop, board, and leave. Another vehicle
reaches the checkpoint, and the game repeats itself.

The absurd exercise reminded me of "The New Disease," a short story
by Kashmiri writer Akhter Mohiuddin, who died in 2001. His son-in-law
was killed in a militant attack on a bank in a hospital complex where
he worked. His younger son, returning home from work, was killed in
retaliatory firing by the military after it came under militant attack. In
protest against the excesses, Akhter had returned the Padam Shri, one
of the highest civilian awards, which the Indian government had given
him for his services to literature. He wrote like Isaac Babel, had similar
intimacy with war, power, and fear, and had dedicated his last book to
"young men who were murdered at unknown places." Like Babel was.

In "The New Disease," a man waits for a long time, as if in a queue,
before entering his own house --- and then turns away and leaves in
another direction. His family takes him to a doctor. The doctor says,
"Ever since frisking has been introduced, a new disease has come up.
Some people need to be frisked every time they see a gate; others frisk
themselves." He prescribes a body search every time the man reaches
a gate. The family follows the prescription, and the man's condition
improves.

An elderly man in a blue suit sat on the bus seat in front of me. He
turned around and said, "What was the point of that? They just want to
assert their presence, tell us they rule this place." The bus moved toward
my uncle's village. There were no more check posts on the way, but we
were traveling on the road where my parents were almost killed. I could
see Mother turning stiff. We remained silent and kept looking out the
bus window. A few minutes later, the bus crossed the water pipe in the
road where the mine had been planted. Ordinary Kashmiri brick houses
flanked the road, and groups of villagers sat lazily outside their homes,
staring at the passengers. I saw those people, but Mother seemed to see
the man pressing the remote control of the mine. She pointed at a group
of villagers and said, "That was where they \[the militants\] sat with the
remote control." I bit my lip and shook my head. We made the rest of
our journey in silence.

Narrow lanes ran between mud-and-brick houses circled by leafless
walnut trees in the village of Panzmulla, where my uncle lived. On the
way to his house, we exchanged greetings with acquaintances and relatives
returning from the customary visit. My uncle, a tall, tanned man,
sat on a carpet surrounded by men and women listening to his stories
of Mecca. Young girls and boys served _kahwa_ in tin-plated samovars.
The visitors sipped the _kahwa_ and heard the tales of faith. Uncle ordinarily
would have been offended if my father hadn't visited him after
his return from the pilgrimage. Instead, the moment my mother and I
walked into his house, he hugged me and said, "How unfortunate are
these times that Ghulam Ahmad can't even come to see me today."

Groups of visitors arrived; Uncle rose from his seat to greet each one.
Every visitor was offered a glass of Aab-e-Zam Zam, the water from Mecca's
spring of Zam Zam, believed to have healing powers. They all asked
the same questions. Yes, the traffic moves on the right side of the road
there; yes, there are people of every color and country wearing the same
white cotton robes. Yes, the shops are very big and full of all kinds of
expensive things. Yes, you are mesmerized when you first see the Qaaba.
Uncle seemed to be getting tired of repeating himself. The _muezzin_'s call
for prayer rescued him, and he left for the mosque. Mother joined a
group of relatives and was soon engrossed in conversation. She was talking
spiritedly and laughing at the jokes. I watched her from a distance
and was glad to see her happy.

I obsessed about the attack on my parents in the months following
it. Lying sleepless at night, I would fantasize about avenging them.
Then I would return to the real world and think of my grandparents,
my aunts, my cousins who still lived in and near my village. I thought
of the shelves full of my father's books and my own aspirations of writing.
Most families accepted the killings of their kin with resignation and
struggled to continue with their lives. Under the Kashmir government
rules, a family member of any innocent person killed in the conflict
in Kashmir was given a low-level government job and the family was
paid a hundred thousand rupees as compensation. In the early years of
the conflict, most people refused to accept such compensation, deeming
it unethical. But life was harsher and more complex than ideas of
resistance. With time, people opened old files and began thinking of
making their lives a little easier, even if that had to be done by accepting
the official price of life. Maybe I would have applied for the monetary
compensation and the job. I had seen that happen in my own extended
family while I was still at college.

One afternoon while I sat in our kitchen and talked to my mother,
there was a knock on the door. Bashir, her cousin who lived in a village
an hour away, stood there, looking distraught and holding the door for
support. Between sobs, he said slowly, "They killed Gulzar. The army
killed him last night, blew him up with a mine." We stepped back in
shock. Gulzar was a cousin to both my mother and Bashir. Two of my
cousins, an aunt, and my grandparents rushed into the kitchen. Grandfather
held Bashir in his arms and stoically said the prayers Muslims say
when someone dies: _Ina Lilahi Wa Ina Ilahi Rajioon_ (Whatever comes from
God, returns to Him.) Grandfather's wrinkled face hardened with pain,
and tears filled his blue eyes. An image of Gulzar flashed in front of my
eyes: a frail boy of fifteen years standing in the courtyard of his house,
the beginnings of a mustache turning his upper lip a shade darker than
his pink face. His hair was short and spiky, and he held a cricket bat.

Half an hour later, my family left for his funeral in his village. I stayed
behind. Somebody had to remain at home, for it was unsafe to leave
your house unattended.

Gulzar's village had grown distant because it was located close to a
massive army camp, and the area was more volatile than our own. I could
not help thinking of the endless frisking and identification parades my
family would have to go through. I was thankful they had a car. Visiting
the place on a local bus was a nightmare. A mini-stampede would follow
after you crossed the check posts. People would run toward the bus in
a frenzy, pushing, elbowing to grab a seat on the overcrowded vehicle.
Bitter arguments followed as the earlier occupant of a particular seat
would try to regain it after the check post.

The next morning they returned, worn out and grieving. Gulzar had
been a twelfth-grade student at the local high school. The new academic
session had just begun, and the senior students were expected to rag the
newcomers. One day Gulzar and his friends ragged a newcomer to walk
up to a girl and propose to her. "Propose" is the word Kashmiri boys
use for asking someone out for a date. The newcomer, a shy boy, reluctantly
walked up to the girl and did what he had been told to do. The girl
retorted sarcastically and humiliated him.

The boy turned out to be the son of an army officer. The following
evening an army patrol surrounded Gulzar's house. They asked for him,
searched the house, and found nothing. Then they took him to the cowshed
used to store firewood, plows, shovels, and sickles. Ten minutes
later, his parents and brothers heard a blast. The cowshed fell apart. The
soldiers had detonated a mine that killed Gulzar. They claimed he was a
militant and had mistakenly blasted the mine after identifying it.

Gulzar's death changed our relationship with his family. My parents,
grandparents, aunts, and cousins visited them every other day. Mother
enrolled his younger sister in a school near our home, and she stayed
with our family till recently, when she graduated from the local women's
college.

After Gulzar's death, nobody talked about fighting in a court to punish
the soldiers who had killed him. Those things happen elsewhere,
in countries where the law is implemented; in Kashmir you try to save
the living from further trouble. The extended family talked about getting
compensation and finding his unemployed elder brother, Ayub, a
job. For months we could not get a certificate from the army attesting
that Gulzar was not a militant. We petitioned India's National Human
Rights Commission, and after some time, the No Objection Certificate
was received. The fact that our family had connections in the local government
expedited the process. Ayub got a job in the rural development
department and was married a year later. Daily life went on. Gulzar was
rarely mentioned at home in conversation. But he remained an invisible
presence.

The schools opened after the winter break. March mornings were filled
with the shouts of children marching past our house. The soldiers at our
neighborhood bunkers seemed to smile a little. The newspapers would
soon carry the standard annual story about snow melting on the _Line of
Control_ and the increase in militants trying to cross over. I stepped out
to buy coffee when the dreaded neighborhood barber standing outside
Bombay Hair Dresser shouted, "Your hair is all haywire." He took at least
two hours to give me a haircut, yet I was a regular because he had a lush
imagination and told stories in the long cigarette breaks during a haircutting
session. I couldn't forget a story he told me earlier in winter,
after militants detonated a land mine targeting Indian soldiers patrolling
our area. "The glass panes shattered, and it was very, very loud. I thought
I was dead. And then in a fleeting moment I saw the Angel of Death holding
a notebook. It had names of the dead in it. My name wasn't there!
And then I lit a cigarette. I knew I would be fine."

I shook my head and praised God and Prophet Muhammad. After a
while I asked him, "Was the death register in English or Urdu?"

"Urdu, of course! You know I can't read English."

Stories! There are no good stories in Kashmir. There are only difficult,
ambiguous, and unresolved stories. I often heard stories about
what happened to families whose kin died in the conflict and who did
not have the relative financial comfort and connections that made moving
on easier for people like Gulzar's family. I had heard many stories
about families seeking compensation for their dead children, visiting
government offices for months, and being entangled for years in red
tape. One of those stories was about Shameema, a woman in a village
not very far from my own. "You must meet her," said the friend who
told me about her.

Shameema lived in the village of Larkipora, around thirty kilometers
south of my village. Larkipora was a huddle of houses and serene fields,
its tragedies hidden from the casual visitor. I walked up a lane that led to
a gate of corrugated iron sheets nailed over rough timber lofts. Beyond
the gate, a thin, sharp-nosed woman in a faded orange _pheran_ sat on the
cobbled veranda of the house. She was bent over a wicker basket full of
_haakh_, a spinachlike local leafy vegetable. She kept the vegetable basket
aside and rose from her seat. She looked at me for a long time before
saying, "Sit here, son. I am Shameema."

I sat facing her. Her younger son, a thirteen-year-old, sat in the other
corner of the rectangular veranda next to a hookah. Shameema's sister-in-law
joined us. The women sat behind baskets full of vegetables. Shameema
held a long leaf of _haakh_, tore a portion, and said, "It was May
eleventh, 2001." I was struck how most people remembered the exact
dates of the most horrifying events in their lives. She continued, "I had
cooked tomatoes and rice and was waiting for Shafi for lunch."

Shafi, her seventeen-year-old son, was a tenth-grade student at the
government school at Qabamarg, a nearby village famous for a Sufi saint's
shrine. Her other son, Bilal, was in ninth grade and her husband, Majid,
worked as a farmer and sold cheap dried fruit at a bus stop in Anantnag.
On the morning of May 11, Shafi went for lessons in physics and chemistry
to two different teachers in neighboring villages despite his father
wanting help at the Anantnag stall. He returned around noon. "I asked
him to have lunch. He asked me to wait till he had brought firewood for
the nearby sawmill." Twenty minutes later, Shafi was back with a cart of
firewood. Shameema pointed at a patch of ground near the stairs where
a child stood eating a banana and said, "That was where he kept the firewood."
She sighed. "Then he left for the mosque for the Friday prayers."

"I met him near the roadside mosque," a male voice said. I had failed
to notice a young man in a brown shirt and loose jeans sitting on the
edge of the veranda. He turned out to be Shafi's friend Mushtaq. "We
were five of us, including his brother, when Shafi joined us. We did not
pray, we sat under a chinar tree by the road and talked." A gunfight had
started between the militants and the Indian army at Qabamarg. "We
talked about the encounter and thought the school could be burned.
Then we saw some army trucks come from far off in the distance." The
boys left and walked quickly to the lane leading toward their houses.
The army trucks stopped and the soldiers ran after the boys. Mushtaq
and another boy escaped; the four other boys were caught and taken
away. Villagers saw the soldiers throw the boys into the trucks and head
back toward Qabamarg.

Shameema's neighbors came running and told her the army had taken
Shafi and Bilal. In a matter of minutes, the mothers and sisters of the boys
gathered near her house. They began running toward Qabamarg along a
track that connected the two villages through mustard fields. Soldiers
circled the fields outside the village. They tried stopping the women,
who pushed and shouted back. Shameema raised her head and looked
at the distant sky and said, "God gave me courage that day. I fought with
every soldier who tried to stop me. Normally, you are scared of soldiers,
but I did not stop that day till I reached the house where the encounter
was going on." She saw soldiers and Ikhwanis (renegade militants working
for the Indian forces) all around. They were firing at a single-story
house. In the courtyard of the building next to it, she saw the arrested
boys. "I saw Bilal from a distance, but Shafi was missing." She paused.
Then she sighed and asked her younger son to bring her some water. He
ran inside and came out after a moment with a copper tumbler. Shameema
drank, put down the glass, and pushed the vegetable basket away
as if preparing for a battle. "I ran toward Bilal, grabbed him by an arm,
and began walking away with him." Bilal hugged her and said that the
soldiers had sent Shafi inside the militants' house with a mine in his
hands.

A soldier hit Shameema on the arm with the butt of his gun and
pulled Bilal toward him. She shouted at the soldier and grabbed Bilal's
hand. He said, "Let me go, Mother. They must have already killed Shafi;
let me die, too." The soldier pulled harder and began walking away with
Bilal. Shameema stood frozen, watching. The soldier thrust a mine in
Bilal's hands and pushed him toward the house. The gunfire was still
going on. "Something seized my heart as I saw Bilal's shivering hands
holding the mine. His legs were giving way, and he was falling to the
ground." Shameema took another gulp from the copper tumbler, wiped
sweat from her forehead, and said, "I lunged ahead and threw myself on
Bilal." She took the mine from her son's hands and held him in her arms.
Three soldiers and an officer circled them, asking her to leave her son.
She told the officer to leave her son and let her take the mine into the
house. "I held on to the mine and asked the officer to blow me up." He
remained silent; she shouted again. "Then he ordered the soldiers to let
us go. I held Bilal. As we walked away I saw them push an old man toward
the house with the mine in his hands."

That night they did not sleep. She held Bilal in her arms, and they
cried for Shafi. Her husband, who had stayed in Anantnag, reached home
in the morning. Neighbors told him that his son had been killed. Three
days after Shafi was buried, they held the final mourning ceremony. For
three days, as was the custom, no food was cooked in their house; their
neighbors cooked for them. On the fourth day, they cooked for their
neighbors and invited the village mullah to offer prayers for Shafi's salvation.
"We cooked the meal on the firewood Shafi had bought the last
time he came home," Shameema said, wiping her tears.

Her thirteen-year-old son was crying, too. She hugged and patted
and consoled him, saying I was there to help with Bilal's job. Then she lit
the hookah and gave it to him as if it were a glass of juice. He puffed violently
and stared at me. Shameema.told me he was psychologically disturbed.
He had been in the same school as Shafi and would run from his
classroom to cry outside the house where Shafi was killed. His condition
had worsened, and he refused to go to school. Then he began smoking.
"I took him to Aishmuqam, to the shrine of Zain Shah Sahib \[a revered
local Sufi saint\]. He has been better since I prayed there. But every time
Shafi is mentioned, he is agitated. Which mother would pass a hookah to
her son? But I have to; it calms him down."

After the mourning period, Shameema and her family began fighting
the wars of daily life. Bilal resumed school, Shameema did the household
chores, and Majid, her husband, took a bus every morning to sell sweets
in town. A month later, one of their educated neighbors told them about
compensation. Majid and Bilal made the required applications and ran
between the police station and the office of the district administrative
head, the deputy commissioner, where the case for compensation was
processed. Since June 2001 Bilal and Majid have become weekly presences
at the deputy commissioner's office. The clerks processing the
compassionate-appointments cases have the standard answer: "Come
next week. Your turn has not come yet." The next week they hear about
a nonexistent ban on such compensatory jobs. "Last month the clerk
told Majid our serial number is four hundred; this week he said it is six
hundred," Shameema told me. "Why don't you meet Majid? He will be
on the pavement at the Achabal bus stop in Anantnag near a fruit shop.
You can ask any shopkeeper there, and they will tell you where he is. He
knows more about the case."

I promised to meet him and began to take my leave. She walked with
me till we crossed the wood-and-tin gate opening onto the lane. She
stopped and stared at me with blank, teary eyes. "Throughout our conversation,
I have wanted to tell you something," she said. I hoped there
was not some other horror that had befallen her family. She held my
hands and said, "You don't know my son. But you look exactly like my
Shafi. If he was alive today you would pass off for twins." I did not know
how to respond and hugged her. I dragged my feet till I reached the main
road. On the other side of the road, I saw a tall chinar tree swaying in
the mild wind. Under its shade, Shafi had chatted with his friends for the
last time.

I saw a bus approaching and waved it down. I got on and rested my
head against the backseat and closed my eyes. Around an hour later,
we reached the Anantnag bus yard, where Majid sold sweets. Dust blew
around; buses and cars honked. Hawkers shouted the prices of their
wares; villagers carrying groceries in colored polythene bags ran around
looking for the buses leaving for their spacious, beautiful villages; and a
group of bored-looking paramilitary men in bulletproof jackets stood
on the pavement holding their assault rifles. A shopkeeper selling fruits
from a shop jutting onto a pavement knew Majid. "Where is his shop?" I
asked. He smiled and pointed to a tiny corner of the pavement between
his and the next shop. I saw a wicker basket full of _seemnih_, a pink sweet I
had loved as a child, raised on a pile of bricks. The gray-haired man with
sunken cheeks wearing a beige _pheran_ was almost invisible behind it. I
walked up to him and said, "Are you Majid?" He rose from his jute mat
and said, "How many grams, sir?"

I could not muster the courage to disturb his world again. I walked
toward the deputy commissioner's office to meet a man who once was
in charge of cases relating to compensation death. A short walk bought
me to the gates of the office complex in Lal Chowk, an unimaginative
imitation of the Srinagar city center. This was the heart of Anantnag
town --- a jumble of houses and shops, open sewers full of filth, noisy
hawkers, honking buses, and whistling policemen. It was somewhat like
the sad small towns of northern India. Past the check posts and metal
detectors, the office complex was a set of barracklike buildings with
windows painted in a dull blue used only on government buildings. It
was the local seat of power, the administrative unit inherited from the
colonial civil service. Groups of impatient supplicants, small-time lawyers,
village politicians, and elders hovered around for audiences and
favors, and the carnivorous foot soldiers of bureaucracy searching for
prey to bolster their meager official salaries spilled over the lawns. The
hurried, hectic sound of hustle and barter filled the place.

Inside, liveried peons shouted the names of supplicants who had been
granted an audience with various officers. I walked through a dark corridor
to meet the man who might know about Shameema's relief case.
I had known him for many years. Piles of tattered cardboard cover files
lay on his decrepit wooden table. Similar files covered with dust were
stacked away on shelves behind his chair. Four more people sat behind
similar tables covered with stacks of files, typing on antique Remington
typewriters. He smiled as he saw me looking at the typewriters and files.
He had seen me as a kid and was both amused and disappointed to see
me not as a bureaucrat, like my father, but as a writer interested in "random,
unimportant people."

"What happens is that first they have to get a first information report
lodged in a police station and get certificates from the police saying
that the person killed was not a militant. So they pay anything from
five thousand to ten thousand rupees to the policemen who would not
otherwise give the report. Then the cases come here to the relief section
in the D.C. office. We have to make the file move." He paused to smoke.
"The file does not move by itself from one table to another. Nor does the
typist type an order for free. The senior officers are to be convinced and
given their share, too. All this takes time and money. Out of the relief
money of one _lakh_, the applicant has to spend twenty-five to thirty thousand
rupees. Otherwise he will waste years visiting offices. And once he
pays that, we ensure that his name in the compensation job list goes up
and things move fast." He sounded like an automaton.
