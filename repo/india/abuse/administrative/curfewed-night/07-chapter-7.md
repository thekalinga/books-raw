## Situation

In the winter of 2001, I was in a meeting with my editors at the
Bombay headquarters of my news site. The air around the conference
table was charged. Reporters were tossing around ideas:
scoops, big interviews, detailed stories on complex subjects. Editors
argued back, agreeing, disagreeing. Performances were being evaluated,
decisions made about assignments. Economy. Elections. Environment.
Urban politics. And Kashmir!

I had worked as a police reporter and a court correspondent; occasionally,
I wrote about fashion, cinema, and television --- anything my
editors asked for. But after work, I obsessively read about armed conflicts
around the world. I was training myself for the one story I had to
tell. And then my editor said, "Basharat! You are going to Kashmir."

One early December afternoon, I was on a flight from Delhi to Srinagar.
I was finally going home as a reporter to tell the stories of Kashmir.
I had never flown home and continually stared out the window. Frozen
crusts of snow on mountain peaks brought the first intimation of home.
A silver-gray blanket of fog hid the arcs of steep mountains framing the
valley. The plane began to descend. Silhouettes of village houses and
leafless walnut trees appeared amid a sea of fog. On the chilly tarmac,
the fog formed rings of smoke.

When my car left the airport gate, it was as if I had emerged in the
midst of a siege. Scores of olive military trucks with machine guns on
their turrets lined the road. Solemn-faced soldiers in heavy overcoats
slinging assault rifles hung around the trucks and check posts. In summer
they would swagger on the roads in dandyish bandanas, but the bitter
chill of Kashmiri winter had subdued them a bit.

In Srinagar the streets were quieter; the naked rain-washed brick houses
seemed a little shrunken; men and women walked leisurely on the sidewalks
in loose wool _pherans_, their pale faces reddened by the cold.

I dropped my bags at the house my parents had rented in southern
Srinagar after the land mine blast. I ate a quick lunch with Mother, and
then prepared to step out. "Where are you going?" she asked. "I have to
find stories," I told her. "I am on deadline." She smiled. I walked onto
the street, almost quixotic, my notebook and pen ready to record, my
gaze at times a restless dart, at times clouded by despair.

A short ride in a rickshaw brought me to a small enclave in Lal
Chowk, where most newspapers had their offices. The Press Enclave, two
opposing rows of staid white and redbrick buildings, had been renamed
Mushtaq Ali Enclave. A little ahead of the marble plaque engraved with
that name, I passed the whitewashed house of the celebrated BBC
radio reporter Yusuf Jameel. One September afternoon in 1995, Jameel
had walked into his office with a younger journalist, Mushtaq Ali. An
unknown veiled woman had left a parcel for him. As Jameel began to
open the parcel, the phone rang in an adjoining room. He rushed to take
the call. Mushtaq opened the package. It exploded. Jameel was injured,
and Mushtaq died three days later. Everyone believed that the Indian
Army had sent the package to silence Jameel.

A little ahead of the house, I entered the modest redbrick office of
_The Kashmir Times_. Smoke billowed out of a charcoal heater, or _bukhari_,
in the tiny newsroom. Four men sat behind old wooden tables, typing
on ancient computers. Piles of press releases and notebooks cluttered
their desks. A file of old newspapers hung from a wooden stand, and a
seventies-style black telephone sat on the window. Masood, a veteran
reporter and friend, welcomed me. "The first Kashmir assignment!" he
shouted, and hugged me.

I sat on a wooden chair by the charcoal heater. I was excited and nervous
and wanted his advice. "It all depends on how you write, how you
choose your words," he said slowly. "Thirty-seven words is all you need
to know to be a reporter here." He laughed the weary laugh of a man
who had witnessed a lot. It was a grim list: _fear_, _arrest_, _prison_, _torture_,
_death_, _Indian security forces_, _separatists_, _guerrillas_/_militants_/_terrorists_,
_grenades_, _assault rifles_, _sandbag bunkers_, _army installations_, _hideouts_,
_crackdowns_, _search-and-destroy operations_, _frustration_, _tension_, _anxiety_,
_trauma_, _democracy_, _betrayal_, _self-determination_, _freedom_, _peace
talks_, _international community_, _mediation_, _breakdown_, _despair_, and
_rage_.

One of Masood's colleagues joked about a wire service reporter in
Srinagar who, it was rumored, had written the basic format for his news
stories years ago. He kept altering names and figures in his basic reports,
which read: "At least seven protesters were killed and fifteen injured,
three of them seriously, when paramilitary forces opened fire on demonstrators
at X village in south Kashmir." Or: "Five civilians were killed and
twenty injured when militants hurled a grenade at troops in the north
Kashmir town Baramulla. The grenade missed the target and exploded
on the street. The injured have been rushed to a local hospital." "Don't
follow that example," Masood said.

We drank tea and talked a little more about stories. Masood checked
his watch. It was quite late in the afternoon. "Who is doing the situation
today?" he asked nobody in particular. One of his younger colleagues
rose and checked a chart that read: _SITUATION_. "It is my turn," he said. A
reporter was on duty to check the day's death toll. The young reporter
dialed the police-control number. "I am from _The Kashmir Times_. Could
you please give me the situation for the day?" He scribbled the names of
the dead and the injured.

Outside, it was already getting dark. Shopkeepers were pulling down
shutters. Buses didn't linger, conductors hurriedly shouted the names
of destinations. Rickshaw drivers were alert, ready to leave with a passenger.
The twilight seemed pregnant with a fear that descended on the
city every evening. Few lights were switched on in my neighborhood
after dinner, fewer vehicles ventured out. Check posts, searchlights, and
curfew owned the night.

Mornings came late. The hills surrounding Srinagar remained hidden
in a thick fog, and every color faded and made way for a stark gray. The
air in tea shops in Lal Chowk was thick with cigarette smoke and talk of
politics. America, bin Laden, 9/11, Tora Bora, the war on terror. Everyone
had a theory. The world has changed. The world has not changed.
America will be interested in Kashmir. America will not be interested in
Kashmir. I interviewed people, wrote my stories, hung out with journalist
friends in tea shops and newspaper offices, and took care to get back
home by sunset. Nothing extraordinary happened during my two weeks
in Srinagar, but I met a man I can never forget: Maqbool Sheikh.

In his late forties, slightly plump, Maqbool was a paramedic at the
police hospital in Srinagar. He had straight black hair and a face that
could have belonged to any other middle-aged man on his way to work
in Srinagar. Yet he was the most intimate witness of the costs of armed
conflict. He was the only autopsy expert at the police hospital, where
most of the people killed in and around Srinagar were brought. Between
1990 and 2001, he had conducted autopsies on more than eleven thousand
bodies of civilians, militants, and soldiers. Maqbool worked for
under two hundred dollars a month and didn't have a telephone in
the house. Policemen knocked on his door every time the mortuary
received a body at night. "Every time I hear a knock, my heart seems
to stop beating," Maqbool told me. "I know someone has been killed.
Throughout the ride to the mortuary, I keep thinking who will it be: a
child, a woman or another young man."

He dreaded the encounter with every new body, hated cutting it
open to find out how the person had died, what weapon was used, and
what distance it was fired from. The law of the land requires such details
be recorded; judgments are pronounced on the dead, and those judgments
affect how their families live and are treated by the law. Which
side was the dead man on? Was he a guerrilla? A police informer?
A soldier? A bystander? Or just a man who had been arrested and
killed? Maqbool's scalpel sought answers in the wounds and ruptures
of bodies.

The knowledge that a major part of his job alleviated the pain and
shock of grieving families helped him go on. Blasts killed many and
tore the bodies into pieces. Families arrived at the mortuary looking for
their missing children. "I imagine the face of a father who is waiting to
receive the body of his young son. The least I can do is to stitch together
the scattered parts and hope that it lessens the shock," Maqbool told me.
My eyes wandered to his rough, calloused hands. He noticed that and
smiled sadly. "At times after mine blasts, I find myself standing in a heap
of torn limbs, and then it is a struggle to ensure that the fingers I stitch to
a hand are of the same person."

Some years back, after a grenade blast in a Srinagar suburb, five bodies
were brought to the police hospital in a truck. Maqbool was sifting
through them, when he saw an arm move. "I pulled him out. He was
young and he was alive." A little later, Maqbool found the boy's father
waiting to collect his son's body. "I told him that his son was alive." The
old man began whirling and shouting, "He is alive," and then he stopped
and sat on the hospital floor and cried and cried.

"Nothing is harder than the death of one's child," Maqbool said.

One afternoon he walked toward the autopsy table with his surgical
kit. He read verses of the Quran and sought forgiveness from the
dead for touching their bodies, which is forbidden in Islam. Reciting
the Quran gave him courage. Maqbool raised his scalpel, but he felt the
eyes of a five-year-old staring at him. "His eyes seemed alive. It felt as if
he could see me." Maqbool refused to do the postmortem. "It makes me
think of my children."

Maqbool has a daughter and two sons. One of his sons drove an auto
rickshaw, and the other had dropped out of high school. The dropout
son seemed to be getting angrier by the day about the brutal ways of the
Indian military. Maqbool feared he might join a guerrilla group. "I was
worried where his anger could lead him."

His was a fear most parents shared in Kashmir. The entire generation
that grew up in the nineties is far too intimate with violence. It
reminded me of a ten-year-old cousin who plays a game called _army-militant_. Cricket bats become wooden guns, and broken plastic balls
stuffed with cloth turn into hand grenades. My cousin and his friends
take combat positions. A child shouts "Fire!" and they pretend to be
guerrillas and soldiers shooting each other. When it snows and the guns
turn quiet, they still make snowmen, using charcoal pieces for eyes.

Maqbool took the angry son to the mortuary. "I thought maybe I
could persuade him to assist me, and I would also get to keep an eye
on him." His son couldn't bear standing through an autopsy. "He vomited
and did not eat for three days." The boy stayed away from trouble.
Twenty-five years earlier, when he'd gotten the job with Kashmir Medical
Services, Maqbool considered himself lucky. "Only yesterday after
work, I took some fruits for my daughter. She dropped the packet and
shrieked that my clothes stink of blood."

Writing about such violence-stained lives was painful, but the writing
partially liberated me. A few years earlier, a young army captain
posted near our village had harassed my grandfather because he was not
carrying an identity card. I was angry but couldn't do anything about it.
As a reporter, at least I could tell the stories. Yet the two weeks in Kashmir
had shredded my initial euphoria at being home. Listening to people
talk about death, fear, and humiliation was hard. It made me angry and
sad. It made me cry. I had to come back and spend more time in Kashmir.

Before returning to Delhi, I went to spend a night with Grandfather
in the village. Winters mean a heavy snowfall and a slower pace of
life. Even the militants and the soldiers took it easy; less blood was
spilled. We were leisurely drinking tea and talking, indifferent to the
television droning on, when the news anchor's voice turned shrill and
loud. "Terrorists have attacked the parliament!" I was startled by a chaotic
barrage of sounds and images on the screen: the sirens of police
cars, soldiers and policemen running, ducking, and firing at the terrorists
in military fatigues running inside the parliament building, smoke
rising from exploding tear-gas shells, the resounding echoes of their
gunfire, the body of a dead terrorist on the stairs of the parliament building,
and a little later, the shaken legislators being led out. I feared that a
war might erupt between India and Pakistan. "This winter the snow will
turn red." Grandfather sighed. I quickly said goodbye, rushed to Srinagar,
and called my editor. "Stay there. You will have a lot to report from
Kashmir," my editor said.

The details of the attack became clearer: In the morning legislators
had gathered in the domed central hall of the circular colonnaded
building of the Indian parliament, a majestic presence in the heart of
New Delhi. They were arguing about the involvement of the Indian
defense minister in an arms scandal. White Ambassador cars were lining
up on the concourse. At about eleven-thirty A.M., policemen at the
main parliament gate saw a white Ambassador approaching with five
men inside. It appeared to have the necessary entry pass on the windshield;
they stepped aside. The car accelerated as it moved past the red
sandstone wall of the parliament. The next moment it had collided
with one of the cars in the motorcade of the Indian vice president,
who was expected to emerge from the parliament at any moment.
As policemen ran toward the Ambassador, its doors opened, and five
men with guns started firing at the police. They scattered onto the
parliament's large grounds before anyone could retaliate. The speaker
abruptly adjourned proceedings in the debating chamber. Emergency
messages crackled across police radios: _Terrorists had attacked the parliament_.
More police and paramilitaries were urgently summoned. A
fierce battle was fought outside the building. Inside, around two hundred
trapped and terrified legislators listened for half an hour to gunfire
and grenades. By noon it was all over. The five armed men had been
killed. Eight policemen and a gardener were also dead.

In the days following the attack, hostility rose as India ordered half a
million soldiers to the India-Pakistan border. On television, analysts
talked about a nuclear war; newsmagazines calculated the extent of devastation
Indian and Pakistani nuclear bombs were capable of. Kashmir
was debating whether India or Pakistan would go to war. A lot of Kashmiris
I interviewed on the streets in Srinagar wanted a war. "It will be
better than dying slowly every day!"

Indian and Pakistani gunners were continuously firing mortar shells
at the villages along the border and the _Line of Control_. Yet I somehow
didn't believe they would go to war.

Like most journalists, I drove to the villages along the border. Families
of refugees lived in tents and school buildings in various towns near
the border. Many were in hospitals with legs and arms torn by shrapnel.

One early morning, a photojournalist and I drove to Banglar, a village
on the border. We drove on an empty road, passing deserted villages.
Thousands of Indian soldiers were already on the border, and hundreds
of their olive-green trucks were headed that way. The soldiers struck
battle-ready poses for the photographer.

Banglar was a few dozen bare huts and houses among fields of wheat,
mustard, and wild grass. The border was simply a barbed-wire fence,
abandoned fields full of land mines, wild grass, and bunkers. We met the
few men who had stayed behind to guard and feed their cattle. We took
pictures of destroyed houses. A policeman who had just arrived from his
posting in a faraway town to check on his destroyed house was telling
me how tired they were of the cross-border shelling every time relations
between India and Pakistan became embittered. "They should fight
a war now and settle it. We are tired of dying every day." As we spoke,
the shelling began again. I could hear the hiss of a mortar going over our
heads and falling a few hundred yards away. The policeman rushed the
photographer and me into a cowshed. We sat on cow dung for the next
hour, praying. Then the shelling stopped for a minute. We ran out of the
village.

***

Delhi had changed after the attack on the Indian parliament. The residents
of the city scanned every stranger's face. I was looking for a place
to stay. I met about a dozen people who had advertised in a local daily for
a tenant for a two-room flat. Mr. Sengupta, a lawyer, was happy to know
that I was comfortable with arranging the whitewashing and repairing
the broken electric switches. In his living room full of law journals and
imitations of Indian miniature paintings, we talked about the rent, my
work, and my income. He patted his dachshund pup as he spoke. "So,
your parents are posted in Kashmir?"

"They live there; we are Kashmiris. I studied here and work here."

"Oh! You are a Kashmiri. A Kashmiri Muslim." He asked me to call
him the next day. When I did, he said, "You are like our own son. But my
daughter called, and a friend of hers has to stay in Delhi. We will have to
house her. I cannot rent out the flat."

Over the next few months, I continued hearing similar responses
from landlords and real estate agents. The armies were still on the borders;
the war clouds were still hovering. I responded to a few dozen
advertisements, but I was still spending nights on my friends' couches.
The first words I spoke to the last real estate agent I met were: "I am
Muslim, and I am from Kashmir. Now, do you have a place to rent?"

Naresh Chandra, an elderly property agent with a slight build and a
slighter mustache, was sympathetic. "They do not understand. All the
five fingers are not the same. You are a Kashmiri, but you are not what
they think of you." He added, "Sikhs could not rent an apartment for
ten years after the 1984 riots." Another month passed. The generosity
of my friends was heartwarming, but the city was changing for me. In
newspaper advertisements, police warned against possible attacks by
Kashmiri militants. Security checks and barriers outside theaters, railway
stations, and markets added to the paranoia. I was scared to say
I was a Kashmiri. But it was impossible to hide, people could tell from
my long nose and pale complexion. I carried my press card with me
all the time. Even then I avoided busy markets and entertainment complexes.

Someone suggested an address in a Muslim ghetto at the other end
of the city. Muslims in Delhi lived mostly in the squalor of the old city
near the Red Fort or in the overcrowded, dingy Okhla area in the southern
corner of the city. It was hard for Muslims to rent or buy a place in
the mostly Hindu middle-class or upper-middle-class areas. HSBC and
Citibank, which had hundreds of branches in Indian cities, refused to
entertain requests for personal loans from the Old Delhi or Okhla areas;
Pizza Hut would not deliver a pizza there.

I was considering leaving Delhi when a broker called. "I have an old
lonely lady who wants a paying guest." It meant being in by ten at night,
sharing the bathroom with her, and having no guests. As we entered her
apartment, I saw a frail woman in her seventies talking in Kashmiri on
the phone. I smiled at the broker. The elderly woman was a Kashmir
Hindu who had moved to Delhi with her husband some forty years ago.
"Where are you from?" she asked in Hindi.

I answered in Kashmiri and told her that I was a journalist, that my
mother was a schoolteacher, that my father was a bureaucrat, that my
brother studied German at the university close to her house. "My husband
was a bureaucrat, like your father." She smiled and talked about
some of her relatives who were bureaucrats in the Kashmir government.
My parents happened to know them. "You are a journalist. You
write in English. That is very good." She offered me a seat in her drawing
room, where pictures of her husband and Kashmiri Hindu deities
hung from the walls. I paid the rent and the advance; there was no
contract to sign. "He is from a good family. He will be like my own
son," she said to the broker.

I fought my tears; after months of suspicion, I was being welcomed.
