## In the Courtyards of Faith

Shameema and Majid, who had lost a son, were wading through
the painfully slow bureaucratic procedures to find a job for their
other son, and they didn't have enough resources to pay for
treatment of their younger son with psychological disorders. All they
seemed to have was each other and faith. Hussein, who refused to marry
after he was tortured, prayed regularly to find the strength to deal with
his predicament. I had seen my own parents credit God for saving their
lives and increase their prayers after they survived the mine blast. Shahid
told me that even the doctors at the crowded psychiatric hospitals
recommended a reliance on faith. God and his saints seemed to have
become the psychiatrists with the largest practice in Kashmir; faith was
essentially a support system.

That was how it had always been. In my childhood and adolescence,
I had no self-consciousness about Islam --- it was just there, a part of
our life, like my village, my neighborhood, my family, and the books
on my father's shelves. Our neighborhood mosque was a place I visited
with most of my friends on Fridays and occasionally in the evening for
prayer. There was a sense of community, a joyous banter, and an ease
with which religion was practiced. We were all neighbors who went
to the same baker, the same doctor, and the same grocer. Our mosque
was a modest two-floor building a few hundred yards from my house,
on the bank of a small stream that went through the village. Children
would swim in the stream for hours; village women would wash clothes
and utensils on the bank, or _yaarehbal_ (literally, the place where friends
meet), and gossip. When the _muezzin_ gave the call for prayer, the women
would look for their head scarves and wear them till the prayer was over,
then return to their talk.

Handwoven grass mats softened by years of use covered the mosque
floor, and a few dim electric bulbs cast a pale light on the walls covered
by a fading green paint. An arch-shaped recess in the prayer hall marked
the space for the imam to lead the prayers, facing west toward Mecca.
Next to the prayer hall was the _hamaam_, a small room with a limestone
floor heated by burning a few logs of wood in the basement. Gul Khan,
the tiny baby-faced farmer who lived next to the mosque and gave the
call for prayer, often went door-to-door soliciting contributions for the
upkeep of the mosque. In the winter, men sat in the _hamaam_ and discussed
village affairs, religion, and politics. It was the warmest place in
the village.

The imam read the same sermon in Arabic every Friday. I knew where
the names of the prophets Muhammad, Eesa (Jesus), Moosa (Moses),
and Ibrahim (Abraham) appeared, though I never understood what the
sermon meant. We always walked back home from the mosque with
relatives and friends. After the Friday prayers, it was customary to prepare
a big samovar of tea and gather around it for hours. In those conversations,
we would often retell a joke about a Kashmiri villager who
went to Mecca for the Hajj. He stayed in a hotel, and the hotel manager
got irritated with him at some point and began shouting at him in Arabic.
The villager knew Arabic as the language of prayer and responded,
"Aameen."

I could put many faces to that hypothetical villager. A group of old
men would sit in the warm _hamaam_, half asleep. I often suppressed
laughter on seeing them jolt out of their reveries as Gul Khan shouted
the call for prayer. After the prayers, they would settle into a quasimusical
recital of _darood_, the praises of the Prophet and saints in Persian
and Kashmiri, rocking back and forth as they spoke the revered words.
My friends and I never really remembered the _darood_, but we would pray
along, sit cross-legged, rock our bodies, and call out "_Ya Allah_" in chorus,
after the old men. Everyone in the mosque smiled when Saifuddin,
my mother's grand-uncle, would stand in the mosque after Eid prayers
and say, "Oh God! Please bless those who fasted for you throughout the
month of Ramadan. Oh Merciful God! Please forgive and bless those,
too, who ignored your orders and did not fast in the month of the Ramadan."
We knew that Saifuddin never fasted and would slip behind a curtain
in his shop for lunch every afternoon during Ramadan.

In the late eighties, a college teacher leading a Salafist group became
active in my village, and they set up a separate mosque. Most of the
members of the group were lower middle class, with college degrees
and low-rung government jobs. They revolted against the way Islam had
been practiced over centuries in Kashmir --- a mixture of text and tradition.
None of them was a trained Islamic scholar, but they were enthusiastic
readers of various Urdu commentaries on the Quran and Hadith.
They wanted to shear the local traditions created in the long process
of conversion from a Hindu past to Islam. They even introduced differences
in appearance: They folded their trousers an inch above the
ankles, grew their beards long, and prayed at slightly different times
of the day. They saw themselves as social reformers, saving the peasants
from the mumbo-jumbo and exploitation of the priestly class --- the
_moulvis_ and the _pirs_ --- the Muslim Brahmans. A friend described it: "The
_moulvi_'s son's motorcycle does not run on petrol. It runs on the blood
of the villagers." Grandfather, who was always critical of the _moulvis_ and
_pirs_, left our neighborhood mosque and began praying at the new revivalist
mosque three houses from ours.

I went to the Salafist mosque for Friday prayers a few times, but I
found them dry and strict. I was not comfortable with their intense, selfconscious
piety and certainty about being on the right path. They were
dismissive and contemptuous of the not-so-faithful. They endlessly
debated correct Arabic pronunciation and the sin of mispronouncing
the verses of the Quran and Hadith. Another of their obsessions was
the right length of beard: three inches or four inches, one fistful or two
fistfuls. The village children called the leader of the revivalists _the Goat_.

Fortunately, Grandfather never let his affiliation with the revivalists
affect his friendships. He maintained his relations with both the Muslim
villagers who opposed the revivalists and his Hindu friends. His visits
to Somnath's grocery store continued, and so did his friendship with
Bhaskarnath, with whom he taught for many years. Unlike many parts of
India, where violence between Hindus and Muslims had killed hundreds
of people and pushed Indian Muslims into slumlike ghettoes, relations
between the Hindus and the Muslims in Kashmir had been peaceful.
There was a consciousness of religious identities and differences in
political opinion. Many Muslims and Hindus would keep separate cups
and plates in their homes for visitors of the other faith.

In our house, there were no separate cups or plates. We ate together.
I was about ten when I attended the Hindu marriage of Bhaskarnath's
younger brother. I wore black trousers and a black-and-white-checked
shirt and tamed my hair with mustard oil. Grandfather dressed in his
favorite tweed jacket, shaved carefully, and applied liberal doses of Old
Spice aftershave. We sat in a carpeted room full of guests. Lunch, a mixture
of vegetables and lamb dishes, was served on small steel plates. It
was different from the Muslim wedding feasts, where four people eat
together from a tin-plated copper plate; the vegetables are minimal, and
the lamb dishes are spicier and numerous. Somebody who sat next to
me asked, "So you eat at Hindu homes?" Somebody else took pictures
and later gave us copies. I have one of those in my album: Grandfather is
talking to Bhaskarnath; I am holding a morsel of food in my right hand
and staring at the camera.

After the rebellion against India, along with the stories from the
political history of Kashmir, militant groups used Islam for mobilization.
Images from Islamic history had been borrowed, and words like
"martyrdom" and "jihad" were thrown around. By 1993--94 the Islamist
militant groups had gained the upper hand in the separatist militancy,
and the Kashmiri nationalist groups like the pro-independence Jammu
and Kashmir Liberation Front had surrendered and adopted the politics
of nonviolent protest. Pakistan was key to that, being as resolutely
against the idea of an independent Kashmir as was India.

Pakistan turned toward its old-time supporter in Kashmir: the
Jamaat-e-Islami Jammu and Kashmir, a right-wing politico-religious
organization that had been a very small presence in Kashmir since
the early 1950s. Maulana Sayid Abu Ala Mawdudi, a journalist, founded
the Jamaat in Lahore in 1941; he hoped to establish an Islamic state by
reforming individuals, being morally upright, and adhering strictly to
Islamic convictions.

Jamaat reached Kashmir a decade later and tried to expand its influence
by running schools, holding regular cadre meetings, and extensively
distributing pamphlets and cheaply printed books written
Mawdudi. It remained close-knit, cadre-based, and grew in the selfrighteousness
and political ambition common to such groups. It contested
state elections in the late 1960s, hoping that its continuous
criticism of the National Conference's failure to get a plebiscite held in
Kashmir would convert into votes. But it never got more than three or
four seats out of seventy in the Kashmir assembly. Though most Kashmiri
Muslims were disillusioned with India and had sympathies for Pakistan,
they did not take very kindly to Jamaat. In 1979, when Pakistani dictator
Zia-ul-Haq hanged the socialist prime minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto --- who was liked by Kashmiri Muslims --- Jamaat supporters were
attacked by mobs in Kashmir and their houses burned. Grandfather saw
the angry villagers throwing copies of the Quran into a bonfire in the
road near our house. "I tried to stop them but they wouldn't listen and
said that it was a Jamaat-e-Islami Quran."

But in the early nineties, Jamaat reasserted itself after its militant wing,
_Hizbul Mujahideen_, was founded. Jamaat men became all-powerful because
of their influence in the militant group, which had immense support from
Pakistan and sought Kashmir's accession to the country. I remember a
Jamaat man from my village who ran a drugstore. He used to be a polite,
quiet man, but something changed around 1992. He did not walk; he swaggered.
You can tell a Jamaat member from his self-assured bearing, his eyes
blazing with certainty, his air of some hidden, conspiratorial knowledge,
and his short regulation beard. There is also the cultlike devotion to the
ideas of Mawdudi. People from all shades of the political spectrum had used
Islam in Kashmir for political gains, but nobody emphasized its place in
the Kashmiri polity as much as the Jamaat. In the early nineties, they had
regular meetings called _ijtimas_, where their workers would try to convince
young men to join _Hizbul Mujahideen_.

I remember sitting at a shop front outside my house one day. The
Jamaat chemist from my village was walking by. I said the customary
greeting, and he leaped to attention, addressing me in an elaborate, earnest
litany, asking about my family, my studies, talking about his hopes
that I would be engrossed in the study of _deen_, or religion. His tone
turned conspiratorial, as if he were sharing the best-kept secret with
me. He threw a brotherly arm around my shoulder and urged me to walk
a little away from the crowd near the shop front. He said, "We need
boys like you. You should come to our _ijtima_." But he never brought it up
again after I replied, "I will come with your son."

Many Kashmiris credit the 1990s rise of the brutal counter-insurgent
group Ikhwan-ul-Muslimoon (the Muslim Brotherhood) to the excesses
of Jamaat men and _Hizbul Mujahideen_. Commonly known as Ikhwanis,
these men were armed by the Indian government and given a free
hand --- immunity from prosecution for their crimes. The Ikhwanis knew
both the separatist militant groups and the Kashmiri society, and that
knowledge made them ruthlessly effective counter-insurgents. They
tortured and killed like modern-day Mongols. Ikhwan was armed and
funded by the Indian army and went on a rampage, killing, maiming,
and harassing anyone they thought to be sympathetic to the Jamaat or
the separatists.

I once met the son of Kuka Parrey, the ruthless founder of Ikhwan.
Parrey used to operate mostly in Baramulla; by the time I met his son,
separatist militants had already killed Parrey. His son told me that Parrey,
who used to be a small-time folksinger, had been a supporter of the
separatist movement and celebrated the young Kashmiris crossing the
_Line of Control_ for arms training by writing and singing a song: "_Shahzaad
Lukh Draayih Azad Kashmir!_" (The Princes Are Marching to Free Kashmir!).
Parrey's son told me that his father had collaborated with the Indian
army only after a Jamaat member insulted and slapped him. Parrey and
his counter-insurgent group were so despised by Kashmiris that when the
militants killed him, his family did not have the nerve to bury him in the
village graveyard. Leaving Parrey's fortresslike house, guarded by scores
of armed paramilitaries, I saw a grilled enclosure in a far corner of the
grassy lawn --- it was Parrey's grave. His son told me that the Jamaat man
who had led his father to become a counter-insurgent had changed sides
and worked now as an informer with a paramilitary force.

After the late nineties, Jamaat tried to distance itself from the militant
groups, partly because hundreds of its members were arrested and
killed by the Indian troops and many more during the campaign by Ikhwan
counter-insurgents. Jamaat continues to be a minority in Kashmir.
If it ever goes to the polls again in Kashmir, I suspect it won't find any
support beyond its traditional supporters or manage to gain more than
the three seats it won in the 1960s.

The majority of Kashmiri Muslims continue to follow an unorthodox
Islam. In fact, Kashmiri society has opened up in the last decade and a half.
Thousands of Kashmiri boys and girls left in the early nineties to study
in Indian cities and towns or universities in North America, Europe, and
Russia. I was one of them; my friends, too, were part of that wave. Most of
us returned to Kashmir as educated professionals, and our long journeys
did change us. While we were gone, another revolution was taking place
all over South Asia, including Kashmir: cable television. Throughout the
conflict, as the Kashmiris' mobility was reduced and they stayed indoors,
they watched thousands of hours of television --- mostly Bollywood movies,
song-and-dance shows, and news. The spread of the Internet and
cybercafés also opened up society.

There have been fringe efforts to impose a Saudi-style Islamic code in
Kashmir, although they invariably fail. In the mostly agrarian society of
Kashmir, men and women have worked together in fields and orchards,
and though women wore head scarves, the idea of veils never really
took off. Even in nonagricultural and urban settings like schools, offices,
and universities, only a small number of Kashmiri women chose to wear
veils. There were a few failed attempts at imposing veils on women,
especially by a puritanical Islamist women's group, Dukhtaran-e-Millat
(Daughters of the Muslim Community), headed by Asiya Andrabi, who is
not known for much else. I had not heard about her for over a decade.
Then one summer day in 2004 she resurfaced in the public sphere. I
had gone to my preferred cybercafé in Lal Chowk. The manager seemed
distraught and resigned; the doors of most wooden cubicles had been
pulled off the hinges. "Asiya Andrabi and her women were here," he
said.

She and her activists had begun harassing young couples catching a
few moments of intimacy in Internet cafés or sharing lunch in dimly
lit restaurants. In newspaper photographs, Andrabi looked like a female
Zorro, a veiled woman raising fists covered in white gloves. Much later,
I managed to meet her in her Srinagar house; she was barely four and
a half feet tall and covered from head to toe in her signature veil. She
told me she had become a born-again Muslim in 1986, a time when she
had been feeling depressed and thwarted because her family forbade her
from pursuing postgraduate studies in biochemistry in Pune. Frustrated
ambition is a dangerous thing.

She had begun her activism soon after college in 1987 by painting out
the actresses in Bollywood film posters that were put up every week
in Srinagar and elsewhere in the valley. She also agitated for separate
seats for women on crowded buses. Later, she joined an Arabic and
Islamic studies program at Kashmir University. She talked about her
well-educated and upper-middle-class family; indeed, I had been struck
by hundreds of books, including books by Noam Chomsky, Edward
Said, and a copy of the _Bhagavad Gita_, on the multiple bookshelves in
her drawing room. In the early nineties, Andrabi married a commander
of _Hizbul Mujahideen_ who had been in prison for years. She considered
it an honor to be married to a militant despite the accompanying
hardships, and named her son Mohammed bin Qasim, after the medieval
Arab general who conquered India. As we spoke that afternoon,
Andrabi lamented the spread of cable television and conceded that very
few Kashmiri women had followed her.

Puritanical interpretations of Islam continued to fail in Kashmir. On
a visit to my family home in the village, one of my cousins told me about
the eldest son of the teacher who had been the leader of the Salafist
group in our village since my childhood. The boy, in his teens, had studied
with my cousin. It was common knowledge that the man brought
up his children in an ultra-puritanical manner. They had obeyed for
years, but the boys had grown up and were rebelling. "He is a joke in the
school. He runs after girls, speeds his car, and we call him Rainbow,"
said my cousin. I was struck by the nickname and asked what it meant.
"He colors his hair in different colors every week. One day he has black
hair; another day it is red or green."

I remembered how, in my childhood, this boy's father and his group
campaigned against prayers at shrines, as they believed that making the
saint an intermediary between the creator and the creation was unIslamic.
They had been so fiercely opposed by the rest of the village that
they'd hidden in friends' houses lest a mob set upon them. What the
Salafi teacher and his cohorts didn't seem to understand was the social
and cultural significance of the shrine in Kashmiri life. It wasn't merely
a spiritual center but a club, a space for social gatherings, festivities, and
business.

The shrine closest to my house was in the village of Aishmuqam,
near my old boarding school. One early April afternoon I took a bus to
Aishmuqam. A family friend, Kallu, ran a textile shop in the small bazaar
near the bus yard. A road climbed from the bazaar through the village
spread out on clearings on the slope to the shrine cresting the hill.

Before I could begin my trek, I saw Kallu sitting on a wooden platform
in his shop in an elegant Nehru jacket and a Jinnah cap. "Where
have you been all this time?" he asked. His familiar high-pitched voice
was reassuring. His two front teeth were missing; his face had wrinkled.
I narrated the highlights of my absent years: college, university,
and journalism. "And what about marriage?" Everyone always asks you
that --- family, relatives, acquaintances. Razia, his daughter, and Altaf, his
son, were married and ran a school. His own business had been bad
since the fighting began. "But thank God everyone in the family is safe.
In these times every day is a gift." Two men sat beside me in the shop
on wooden chairs. They nodded in agreement. "There are no guarantees,"
one said.

"This morning the troops killed a boy from Pulwama; his body is lying
in the police station," Kallu said. "A policeman came to buy cloth for his
shroud. The army said he was a militant. But who knows?" He turned to
the shrine atop the hill and lifted his hands in prayer. "Oh! Saint Zainuddin!
Be our mediator with the Almighty! Ask Him to take pity on these
people! Ask Him to forgive our sins! You are among His dear ones!"

Wanting to lighten the atmosphere, I reminded him of an old story
that made him laugh. One of the names Muslims use for God is Noor
(the divine light). A white-bearded, pink-faced old mullah from the
Aish muqam mosque was also known as Noor. As a child, I once accompanied
my grandfather and Kallu to the grand mosque for Friday prayers.
My little bit of religious education had taught me that a mosque was the
house of God. Noor was delivering a sermon. I thought he must be God.
After the prayers, I saw Noor walking the same road; I was surprised and
asked Kallu, "Why is God walking the same road as us?"

"You were all of six then. Those were very happy days. Your grandfather
and I told the story to our friends, and poor Noor was embarrassed."
He smiled and said, "That 'God' of yours is dead."

_Allah-o-Akbar! Ashadu An La Ilaha Illalah_! (God is great! There is no God but
God!)

The words calling Muslims for afternoon prayers descended mistlike
from the shrine over the tin rooftops dotting the hill. The smell of
fresh bread in the wicker baskets of bakeries and sacks of spices on the
shop fronts surrounded me as I climbed the steep rocky stairway to the
shrine. Every spring people gathered here for an annual fair celebrating
the end of winter and the beginning of the sowing season. Hundreds of
men, women, and children would light torches (twigs of pine tied to
a willow staff) and stand humbly near the fortress-like perimeter and
in the cobbled courtyard of the shrine. The arched wooden gate of the
shrine inlaid with calligraphy, the latticed windows, and the pagoda-shaped
green roof supported by ornate pillars and crowned by a brass
spire would glow in the bright yellow of the torches.

Years later, devotees still packed the cobbled courtyard. I leaned for
a while over the low boundary wall, taking in the rushing Lidder stream,
the yellow miles of mustard flowers, the roofs and villages miniaturized
by distance and the dark brown arc of the Himalayas. Buddha thought
Kashmir was an ideal location for meditation. Every hillock had a shrine,
and every spring had a temple. It seemed easy to be a believer here. I
turned back toward the courtyard and watched a scraggy-bearded barber
sharpen his razor on a stone. A young couple and an older woman
holding a baby also watched him. The old woman helped the barber tie a
white cotton sheet around the baby's neck. A child's first haircut, according
to Kashmiri Muslim tradition, is performed at a shrine. The barber
massaged the light brown wisps with warm water from an aluminum
bowl. The baby cried, the old woman lulled him into silence, and the
young parents fidgeted. The barber shaved off the baby's hair. The father
gathered the wisps of hair in a handkerchief. The mother took a bowl
full of _tehr_ --- turmeric-colored spiced rice --- and distributed it among the
devotees, who blessed the child.

I followed the family inside the shrine. The keepers of the shrine, the
_babas_, sat on wooden platforms behind brass trays full of coins. The family
donated generously, placing a note or two for each _baba_, all of whom
blessed the child. The interior of the shrine was an ancient cave with
modern modifications. Women in bright floral prints prayed on one
side of a greenish marble platform, and more _babas_ sought donations on
the other. A strong stone pillar supported the cave roof. The _baba_ sitting
there shouted, "It is Mehboob-e-Alam's pillar. Those who lean against it
are relieved of their problems. Make a donation here and lean on the pillar,
young man. Your worries will go away."

I walked toward the end of the cave, where a low, narrow opening led
to a tiny chamber in which the saint used to pray. An elderly man came
out of the opening; two young girls followed him. They bent their backs
and walked backward. The devout do not turn their backs to the saint's
place. An earthen lamp was lit near the opening. Devotees dipped their
fingers into an oil-filled palm-shaped hole in the rock and rubbed their
foreheads. "It will heal your diseases and solve your problems," an old
turbaned _baba_ sang. I crawled into the saint's chamber. A green silk sheet
covered his grave. Eight devotees stood in two rows facing the tomb.
A _baba_ prayed for a while and moved from devotee to devotee with his
brass tray. "Leave big notes on the tray; the saint will take care of you."
I left a little dejected about the domination of commerce over solitude
and gravitas.

As I walked down the stairs to the bus stop, I heard someone calling
me. The short, wiry young man's face seemed familiar. "We were in the
same school. I am Mubashir." He ran a drugstore nearby. I sat on a rough
wooden bench facing the bare wooden desk where he sat on a plastic
chair. Second-rate antacid and cough syrup and paper bags of tablets for
sundry ailments sat on the rough timber shelves along the mud walls.
Floral paper covered the ceiling of wooden beams, and a dim bulb gave
the shop a jaundiced look. Mubashir left to fetch tea. I watched him
cross the street; he limped. When he returned, we talked about our lives
after school, and Mubashir told me that he never finished college.

Mubashir's father was sick in the winter of 1997. The local hospital
was closed. The nineteen-year-old ran to a chemist near Kallu's shop. He
was waiting for his turn when he saw an Ikhwani counter-insurgent walk
toward the shop. Mubashir felt uneasy as he watched the Ikhwani loiter.
"I wondered who was going to get into trouble." Separatist militants
hated the Ikhwanis, and there was bound to be a skirmish. Mubashir
wanted to get the medicine for his father and leave.

The queue moved slowly. The Ikhwani stood near Mubashir, looked
around, made small talk, and juggled a hand grenade like a cricket ball.
Mubashir shouted at the chemist to move faster. Nothing happened. He
waited. Then he heard an explosion, and everything went dark. Six hours
later, he regained his senses on a hospital bed in Srinagar. The grenade
had slipped from the renegade's hand, fallen on the metallic road, and
exploded. The renegade had died there. Scores of splinters had pierced
Mubashir's legs. For three months doctors operated on and nursed him.
He returned home in a wheelchair and left it after two years with a limp.
His treatment cost the family a fortune. His father retired from his lowrung
government job. Mubashir had to support the family. His degree did
not guarantee a job, and he knew no influential men. He dropped out of
college and set up his drugstore, which fetched a little money. Every day
he sat on the blue plastic chair behind the bare wooden desk, waiting
for patients to buy medicines and dreaming of what could have been
possible.

I left his shop and began my descent to the bus yard. He joined me,
dragging his legs from one cobbled step to another. I dissuaded him. He
paused, turned back, and said, "Basharat! It is hard to say, but can you
help me find a job? Help me out of this hell." It was difficult to answer
that question. Yet if I saw hope, it was in education. "I will talk to my
friends," I told him, "but you will have to complete your degree. Without
your degree, there is no hope."

He agreed. "I will call you once I finish my degree. With Zain Shah's
blessings, something might work out." His eyes had a faint glimmer of
hope. We parted. His words accompanied me home. I thought of his
hopelessness, his clinging to straws of faith.

People seemed to need faith, to need miracles. A week later, I was at
my Srinagar house, talking about it with a poet friend who made his
money by producing unwatchable programs for state television. He said,
"In these times, faith has become the support system for the rich, the
famous, and the unknown poor. People have no hopes from the government
or any other politicians. They turn to the shrines, to the Prophet,
and to God." He told me about one of the most distinguished poets of
Kashmir, Professor Rashid Nazki, who had immersed himself in faith
after a personal tragedy during the mid-nineties. "He left public life and
lives a retired life in his ancestral village in Bandipora," my friend said.

The small town of Bandipora is around a hundred kilometers from
Srinagar, in the North Kashmir district of Baramulla, close to the _Line of
Control_. One morning I took a shared taxi from Srinagar to Bandipora.
Half an hour outside Srinagar, the road to Bandipora runs along the Jhelum
for miles as the river goes north to cross over to Pakistan and then
the Arabian Sea. Canopies of willow branches shade the road till it rises
onto a plateau occupied by a military camp.

Gazing through the taxi window on my right, I was entranced by the
sight of a lake. "It is the Manasbal Lake," a fellow passenger told me.
On the clear blue water, two yellow _shikaras_ moved gracefully. The road
rose toward the hills in the distance. We rushed past apple and almond
orchards and glittering tin roofs. In a village, a hand-painted billboard
announced: _MUSKAAN BEAUTY PARLOUR, FECIAL, MASAJ AND HEAR-CUTTING_.

On the seat behind me was a family with two energetic children.
Their mother prodded them to behave properly. Excited by the breeze
blowing in through the lowered windows, the boys launched into a
nursery rhyme about the light and the cold breeze.

A check post announced Bandipora. An armored car was parked
nearby, and columns of soldiers stood along the road. The taxi stopped.
The boys in the backseat shouted, "Dishkiaon, Dishkiaon," in their shrill
voices. They used their curled hands as imaginary guns. They were imitating
the sound effects that accompany gunfire in most Hindi movies.
The central market in the town was crowded, though not dirty, like most
other small town markets in Kashmir. The Indian soldiers were the only
outsiders one could see. Until the 1930s, if you had walked around the
same market, every fourth person would have been from one or another
great medieval city of central Asia. The journey from Bandipora to the
cities of Central Asia, even by medieval modes of horse and mule, took a
few weeks. Kashmir's cultural interaction with the cities of Samarkand,
Bokhara, and Kashgar was rich and intense.

Rashid Nazki, the poet, lived in a single-story house with a cedar tree
outside. A boy led me in. The poet huddled under a shawl in a small
room. He had deep black eyes shining out of his sculpted, sunken face.
"You must be the one coming from Srinagar," he said, pushing a cushion
toward me. Offering a guest a cushion to lean against instead of a bare
wall is a local gesture of respect. He stretched out his legs and, leaning
back on a cushion, puffed at his cigarette with shivering, fragile fingers.
"I am an old man living away from the world. What brings you here?" My
friend had introduced me as a journalist, and the poet expected an interview
about his thoughts on the conflict in Kashmir.

He was both surprised and relieved that I had no such questions for
him. "These are difficult times, and journalists ask questions that one can
answer but cannot afford to," he said, a little irritated. "I just wanted to
meet you," I said. A boy in his early teens walked in and asked whether
he would have lunch. "You are joining me for lunch," the poet commanded.
He took a hundred-rupee note from his pocket and handed it
to the boy. "Get some lamb and tell your mother to fry it. The guest will
eat with me." He told me, "He is my grandson." He asked me to tell him
stories about my travels. I told stories; he commented and smoked and
commented and smoked. Food arrived: rice, lamb, and beans. The poet
piled my plate with pieces of lamb. "I would eat that for two days," I protested.
"You are a young man, and you need to eat," he insisted.

After lunch we talked about poetry. "What do you think of the poetry
written in Kashmiri after the conflict?" I asked. "A lot has been written.
The younger generation talks about the conflict directly. Some fine
poems have been written. In English, there is Agha Shahid Ali's work."

"Yes. I love his work," I agreed.

Professor Nazki was silent again. "He was a very fine boy. We were at
his house, and Shahid used to walk like a drunken man. His father is my
friend, and I told him once Shahid was not well. But he believed it was
just a poet's way of being. Soon after that, they detected his tumor. His
death was a great loss. Kashmir needs poets like him, but who can evade
death?" The old poet moved himself to a more erect posture. "Shahid
wrote political poetry, but he did not compromise on technique. Most
political poetry is like blank verse. The polemics remain, and the poetry
dies."

I asked about his own poetry. His poems were in a mystical vein and
had won various awards. I asked him whether there were any English
translations. "Yes, they have been translated into Urdu. Someone from
Delhi has translated my poems into English. The translator never sought
my permission; he did not even send me a copy." He had not written
much since 1990. "I lost half of my family in a grenade blast and stopped
writing after that." I dreaded this moment and bowed my head in silence.
The poet narrated his story in a calm voice.

One afternoon in 1990, when he was teaching at the University
of Kashmir, news came that a bomb had exploded near his house. He
rushed from the university to Bandipora. That morning a militant was
loitering on the lane beside the poet's house, planning to throw a grenade
at a column of soldiers passing by. Afraid of retaliation from the
soldiers, the poet's two sons went out to persuade the militant to throw
it away from the residential area. He was adamant; so were they. Their
mother joined them. Sometime during the argument, which might have
seen much swaying of arms and pointing of fingers to make a point in
Kashmiri fashion, the militant accidentally pressed the pin that sets off
the hand grenade. When the poet reached home, the grenade blast had
killed the militant, his sons, and his wife. "I was in a coma of sorts for
the next eight years. I did not write a single poem. Every time I picked
up a pen, my fingers trembled." He had no courts to turn to for his loss.
"I complained to Prophet Muhammad. I sent my prayers and plaints to
his court." He overcame his loss with his love for the Prophet. "I devoted
my time to translating a biography." He was alive again; his eyes sparkled
as he talked of his work. "You will feel the Prophet's breath when you
read the book. I have used the stream of consciousness." I remembered
one of his lines:

>I asked the dervish sitting on the pavement
>
>How far is the world from here?

Nooruddin Rishi is the patron saint of Kashmir. He was mentored by
Lalleshwari, a Brahmin woman who, after much suffering at the hands
of her in-laws, rebelled and became a mystic, preaching oneness of God
and arguing against the ancient Hindu caste system. As a child, Nooruddin
had been sent to a local mullah, but he refused to read beyond the
first Arabic alphabet, Alif (One). His teacher asked why; he answered,
"There is one God, and I need not know beyond Alif." In his youth, he
renounced the world and prayed in a cave for twelve years. Sometime
after his cave worship, Nooruddin met Mir Mohammed Hamdani, an Iranian
Sufi. Mohammed was the son of the great Sufi scholar Syed Mir Ali,
who arrived in Kashmir in the fourteenth century and attracted Kashmiris
to Islam, and is popularly known as Shah-e-Hamadan (the King
of Hamadan). Before his return and death in the central Asian town of
Khatlan, Shah Hamadan had willed his infant son, Mohammed, to travel
throughout the world in search of learning. After many journeys, the
young man arrived in Kashmir and resumed the missionary and scholarly
work of his father.

Mohammed Hamdani taught Nooruddin Rishi the intricacies of Islam
and the life of the Prophet Muhammad. The discussions of the two men
convinced Nooruddin to focus on social reform rather than renunciation.
He traveled throughout Kashmir, talking to people in their own
language. His interpretation of Islam was rooted in the local traditions
and culture; the masses understood him better than the Iranian and central
Asian Sufis who had brought Islam to Kashmir. He was critical of
the orthodox Muslim priests and the Brahmins for reducing religion to
empty rituals, turning it into a means of self-promotion, and fueling
hatred among the followers of Hinduism and Islam:

>Poring over books they become strangers to their own selves.
>
>Like donkeys whose backs are laden with books.
>
>
>The Mullah is happy with gifts and feasts,
>
>The old Pandit searches for a poung virgin wife.

Under his influence, the majority of Kashmiris became Muslims,
although the conversion to Islam had begun in the early fourteenth
century after Rinchana, a Tibetan prince, became the ruler of Kashmir.
To consolidate his position, Rinchana decided to convert to Hinduism.
But the Brahmin priests refused to convert him, unsure which
caste Rinchana would have. His Muslim friend and adviser Shah Mir told
him about Islam. Rinchana went to sleep in his palace on the banks of
the River Jhelum and woke up to hear the Muslim call for prayer. On
the riverbank facing the palace, a Persian Sufi, Bulbul Shah, was offering
morning prayers. Rinchana rode across the river to meet Bulbul Shah,
who answered his questions. Islam had no caste; men were equal. Conversion
was simply saying: "There is no god but God and Muhammad is
His messenger." Rinchana converted to Islam, patronized the saint, and
ruled generously for three years.

Shah Mir won the battle for succession after Rinchana's death.
Among the successors of Shah Mir, two men are remembered the most:
Sikander, a fanatic, and Zainulabideen, a liberal. Sikander banned music,
wine, and dancing, and is accused of destroying many Hindu temples
in Kashmir near the end of the fourteenth century. Kashmiris remember
the reign of the liberal king Zainulabideen, from 1420 to 1470, as
the golden age. People still refer to him as Bud Shah (the Great King).
He built colleges and offered generous grants to students and scholars
of logic and grammar. He invited master craftsmen and artisans from
central Asian cities, who taught Kashmiris the fine arts of papier-mâché
and carpet weaving. He ended the persecution of Hindus and revived
theater and music. Bud Shah was one of the pallbearers in the funeral
procession of Nooruddin Rishi, who was buried at the town of Chrar,
an hour's drive west of Srinagar, where he had spent the last years of his
life. A shrine built there in his memory became one of the holiest places
in Kashmir.

In May 1995 the Indian army besieged the township of Chrar. Militants
led by a Pakistani, Mast Gul, were hiding in Chrar, since snow had made
their mountainous hideouts uninhabitable. A battle raged in the town,
and soon it was on fire. Twenty-five hundred houses were burned; scores
of civilians were killed. The army took the battle to the shrine complex
where the militants were hiding. The fighting burned down the shrine:
six hundred years of history destroyed in a day. Kashmiris mourned and
marched toward the gutted shrine. Soldiers arrested them, firing on the
protesters. Mast Gul and his men broke the army cordon and escaped.
Kashmiris blamed the Indian army for destroying the shrine; the army
and the Indian government blamed the Pakistani militants, arguing that
they had destroyed the shrine to save themselves.

On a bright May afternoon I was on my way from Srinagar to the
shrine at Chrar. Half an hour later, the taxi left the city and the denser
villages beyond it. We drove through fields, climbed a plateau, and
passed some checkpoints. Nine years later, Chrar seemed like a newly
built town. The jeep stopped outside the new government-built shrine.
It was a white cement building. Its varnished wooden window frames
were shaped in clumsy arches in a halfhearted imitation of the originals.
The galvanized tin sheets mocked the memory of the old shingles. I
stood in the taxi stand, staring at the new shrine. An aged couple walked
out backward in reverence. They stopped near me, their lips moving in
loud prayer: "Oh Sultan of saints! Be kind to us, be kind to our children.
Save them from storms and fires, save them as you have saved them till
now." They had tears in their eyes.
