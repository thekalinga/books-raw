## Papa-2

Prague had protested and won; Berlin had protested and won;
Kashmiris too had believed that their protests would win Kashmir
its freedom. The early nineties were a naive, heady time.
But Kashmiri demonstrations faded out after the massacres. The conflict
might not have turned so fatal if India had allowed those peaceful demonstrations,
mostly throughout 1990 and 1991, and then every now and
then through 1993 and 1994, and even later but not on the same scale.
Maybe those demonstrations would have become the dominant force of
politics in Kashmir; Indians and Kashmiris could have talked, and thousands
of deaths might have been avoided.

But that did not happen. Instead, firing on protesters, arrests, disappearances,
custodial killings, kidnappings, assassinations, and torture
dominated Kashmir. In a prose poem, Agha Shahid Ali wrote:

One November afternoon, I crossed the Zero Bridge and continued past
the old _Radio Kashmir_ building on a rather quiet road. Old buses waited
outside the elite Burn Hall boys' school; supplicants with applications
hung around the gates of government ministers' heavily guarded mansions;
the leafless chinar branches hung over empty stands of the cricket
stadium. I crossed another road and found myself facing a colonial mansion
painted blue and white. A plaque on its gate read: _UNITED NATIONS
MILITARY OBSERVER GROUP FOR INDIA AND PAKISTAN_. The old mansion and
the UN mission both seemed hapless reminders of a lost time. The architecture
of the mansion was a dying style that blended the Kashmiri use
of woodwork with British sensibilities; the United Nations resolutions
on Kashmir, recommending a plebiscite, lived as hollow quotations
in books and journals. A short walk from the UN office, Gupkar Road
was a well-bunkered and -patroled neighborhood. Senior politicians,
bureaucrats, and intelligence operatives lived here in lovely houses
with high, ugly walls and stern guards. Gupkar was our Green Zone. The
road turned toward the Grand Palace, the palace of Hari Singh, the last
monarch of Kashmir. During the nineties, most people dreaded Gupkar
Road. It was the road to _Papa-2_.

_Papa-2_ was the most infamous torture center run by the Indian forces
in Kashmir. Originally, it was a large mansion built by Hari Singh, later
converted into a guesthouse and known as the Fairview Guest House.
Hundreds who were taken to _Papa-2_ did not return. Those who did
return were wrecks. The center was closed down in 1998. A top government
official renovated the _Papa-2_ building and turned it into his residence.
Before moving in, the Oxford-educated officer called priests of
all religions to pray there and exorcise the ghosts.

A friend got me permission to visit. I was supposed to be interested in
architecture. After an identity check, I walked past well-tended flower
beds leading up to the porch. Apple and apricot trees grew in a corner
of the lawn. The pine-clad ridge of the Zabarvan hill rose gently behind
the mansion with its white facade and a red roof. The politician was not
home. One of his men welcomed me into a wood-paneled reception
room with three phones, a fax machine, and a desktop computer. We
began our tour of the house. My guide, a local young man my age,
walked in silence through the rooms. I looked at the chairs, the tables,
the ceilings, and the whitewashed walls. Soft honey-hued curtains hung
on the windows of the politician's bedroom on the first floor. A brown
bedspread covered his bed; paperbacks and hardbacks on law and literature
filled the bookshelves. My guide removed the curtains from the
windows, and clear, bright light fell on the mementos and awards resting
on the shelves. A carpet with verses from the Quran woven into it hung
from one wall, and a painting by the famous Indian painter Raja Ravi
Verma adorned the other wall. My guide was silent. Finally, he spoke:
"This was _Papa-2_, brother! This was _Papa-2_."

An hour later, I was in Lal Chowk, talking to two friends about my visit.
I told them I had to meet people who had survived _Papa-2_. At the same
time I dreaded the idea. "Where can I find them?" I asked my friend. "Ask
anyone on the street," he told me. "Half of Kashmir has been there. Or
just walk up to Maisuma, and you will find ten guys on the street."

Later in the day, I walked past the soldiers and policemen toward the
J&K Liberation Front office in the nearby separatist neighborhood. A
group of young men stood outside the nondescript building. "_Papa-2_?"
I asked. A brief silence followed. They asked one another: "Were you
there?" "No. I was in Rajasthan." "No. I was at Kot Balwal." "No. I was at
Gogoland." "No. I was in Ranchi." Names formed a whole geography of
Indian prisons. "Sayeed was at _Papa-2_." "Irfan was there." "And Irshad was
at _Papa-2_." "Shafi was there, too." In under five minutes I had six names.
"Shafi will be home now," said Abid, one of the men. "Let us go." We
walked through narrow, musty lanes past old, modest houses whose roofs
seemed to lean into an embrace to keep the weak winter sun out. Old
men stared blank stares from shop fronts; younger men stood in twos and
threes, lazily shuffling a bit to make room for a cyclist or a rickshaw.

Abid stopped to greet a few men on the way. He asked them whether
they had been at _Papa-2_. Some talked about their friends who had been in
_Papa-2_; others talked about different jails and torture chambers. Finally,
Abid stopped near a rather decrepit two-story house. He knocked. A
woman's voice asked, "Who is it?"

"Abid here. Is Shafi around?"

"He is at the mosque," the voice shouted back. "Wait there; he shall
be back any moment."

A few minutes later, we saw a tall, frail, bespectacled man in his early
thirties limping toward us with the help of a wooden staff. He shouted
a happy greeting to Abid. They talked for a while, then Abid introduced
me and left: Shafi shook open the door and led me in. We climbed old
wooden stairs and entered a neat room with a layer of cheap green paint
on its mud walls. The floral designs on the floor rug were worn out. In
a corner a bedspread covered a stack of bedding; there were no closets.
Shafi pulled two pillows from the stack, adjusted them as cushions
against the wall, and asked me to sit. In another corner a short, plump,
dark woman sat near a kerosene stove. On the wooden shelves on the
wall facing her were a few cups, plates, and utensils. "She is my wife,
Shafi said. I greeted her; she muttered a welcome and pulled down a
curtain partitioning the makeshift kitchen from the drawing-room part
of the room. Shafi asked her for tea, adding, "Do not add sugar. He will
take as much he likes." His eyes seemed to disappear behind the thick
glasses. His cheeks were deeply hollowed, but his hair was still brown
and curly. Shafi lit a cigarette, bent toward me, and said, "I was at _Papa-2_
for seven months."

In 1990, like most other boys, Shafi, who was nineteen, had decided
to join a militant group. JKLF was the most influential and charismatic
group in his part of Srinagar, so he joined its student wing. His war with
India began: Attacking patrols of Indian soldiers, moving with guns
from one hideout to the next, and evading arrest in crackdowns became
his routine. "We thought Kashmir would be free in a year or two," he
recalled. Instead, he was arrested by a paramilitary patrol. After initial
interrogation at a camp in Srinagar, he was sent to the Kot Balwal
and Talab Tilloo jails in the Jammu province. Two years later, he was
released. Back home, he met his comrades-in-arms. "I began working
for the movement again."

One day in the autumn of 1992, he was spotted by a local boy collaborating
with the paramilitary Border Security Force. "I knew him. He
had become a BSF informer and pointed me out. I was not carrying any
weapons and was arrested."

Shafi's wife called from behind the yellow curtain. "The tea is ready,"
he said. He rose, brought a tray full of biscuits, two cups, and a flask. He
began pouring tea but fumbled with the cups, squinting. I volunteered to
help, and he let me. I kept his cup next to him, and he again touched it
slowly, as if assuring himself of its presence. "They kept me in the local
BSF camp for a week before shifting me to _Papa-2_." At the BSF camp,
he was interrogated, beaten with fists, feet, batons, guns. They wanted
information about his group; they wanted his weapons. He did not tell
me whether he gave the information and the weapons. It is hard to ask
that question if you are a Kashmiri.

Shafi was moved to _Papa-2_. "It was hell," he said, fumbling to find the
cigarette burning on the ashtray. He was thrown into a room crowded
with twenty men. The floor was bare. Smears of blood blemished the
whitewashed walls. Every man had a coarse black blanket for bedding.
The blankets were full of lice. "We called them lice blankets." He
laughed. A corner of the room was their toilet. The prisoners defecated
and urinated into polythene bags in that corner; they then threw the
bags into a dustbin. Every time a man had to go to the bathroom, two
others held a blanket like a curtain to give him some privacy. Others
stared at the floor. Shafi and his fellow prisoners slept laid out like rows
of corpses. Throughout the night, people woke up shouting, cursing the
lice, trying to sleep again, only to be woken up by the next man battling
the vermin. Some managed to sleep, though the lights were never
switched off. "During the interrogation, I was made to stare at very
bright bulbs. Even in our room the light burned my eyes. I craved darkness."
Darkness came. "I began losing my eyesight there. I can barely see
now, despite my glasses."

After his release from prison, doctors prescribed an operation
to restore his sight. "Why didn't you have the surgery?" I asked. Shafi
smiled. "I cannot afford the cost." He could not find work anywhere.
In the summer he sold secondhand garments on a wooden cart in Lal
Chowk; in the winter he followed his brother to Calcutta, hawking Kashmiri
shawls on commission. His family wanted him to get married and
begin a new life. They went around looking for a girl for him. Nobody
would marry Shafi, a man shattered by his militant days, prison, and
nonexistent job prospects. His brother knew a Muslim family in a Calcutta
slum. They had a squint-eyed girl whom nobody would marry. Her
family was happy to marry her off to Shafi. Now she was there behind
the curtain, asking whether we wanted more tea. "She is pregnant, and I
have to take her to Calcutta for the birth." He sounded tense.

Shafi lived off a thousand rupees that Yasin Malik, the JKLF chief, gave
him every month. "I did ask other leaders for help. I said that I am here
because I spent my youth for the movement, but I was disappointed."
Some separatist leaders asked him for proof of his being a militant, of
his jail days. "They live in big houses and drive big cars bought from the
money that came for the movement. But they are not willing to help
those who destroyed their lives for the cause." His face contorted with
anger; he took long, hard puffs from his cigarette. "I never went to them
after that. None of the leaders except Yasin Malik had to go through
what the boys \[arrested militants\] endured. They cannot even imagine
what being tortured is like."

He drank the last gulp of tea and lit another cigarette. I thought of
the separatist leaders giving statements to crowds of journalists in their
mansions; I thought of the security guards from Indian paramilitary and
the J&K police guarding them; I thought of their white Ambassador cars
making them look like mirror images of their ideological rivals in the
state. They spoke of the sacrifices of the people of Kashmir; they spoke
of the struggle for freedom. Shafi had believed in them and felt let down
by them. The contrast between his and their lives was stark. He held my
hand and said again, "They cannot even imagine what being tortured is
like."

He wanted me to know. "They made you sit on a chair, tied you with
ropes. One soldier held your neck, two others pulled your legs in different
directions, and three more rolled a heavy concrete roller over your
legs. They asked questions, and if you didn't answer, they burned you
with the cigarettes." He paused and then, as if suddenly remembering
something, said, "The worst part was the psychological torture. They
would make us say 'Jai Hind' \[Victory to India\] every morning and every
evening. They beat you if you refused. It was very hard, but everyone
said it except Master Ahsan Dar \[a top commander of _Hizbul Mujahideen_\]."

He stopped abruptly. "I cannot talk about it. It makes me crazy."
He said I should meet Ansar, another former militant who had been
in _Papa-2_, who would be willing to talk about torture. I was unsure
whether I should. Was I scared of facing it, of having to write about
it later? I spent the next few days arguing with myself before meeting
Ansar.

I met him at his brother's grocery shop near the grand mosque in
downtown Srinagar. We sat in a small, poorly lit room in his house
behind the roadside shop. Ansar was a robust, mustached man in a beige
_shalwar kameez_. He had joined a separatist organization called People's
League in the mid-eighties and become one of the earlier members
of its militant wing. One day he was visiting his parents when the BSF
raided his house and arrested him. "They had information that I was
here. Someone in my neighborhood was the informer." He talked about
various prisons he had been in.

"And _Papa-2_?" I asked.

"How can I forget it? Not even stray cows would eat the food they
threw at us there." He passed a plate of plum cake to me. "That place
destroyed most people who were there. You do not live a normal life
after that torture. It scars you forever." He lit a cigarette. "They beat
us up with guns, staffs, hands. But that was nothing." He talked as if he
were reading from a manual. "They took you out to the lawn outside the
building. You were asked to remove all your clothes, even your underwear.
They tied you to a long wooden ladder and placed it near a ditch
filled with kerosene oil and red chili powder. They raised the ladder like
a seesaw and pushed your head into the ditch. It could go on for an hour,
half an hour, depending on their mood."

"It was the beginning. At times they would not undress you but would
tie you to the ladder. You almost felt relieved until they tied your pants
near the ankles and put mice inside." He paused, poured more tea, and
said, "Or they burned your arms and legs with cigarette butts and kerosene
stoves used for welding. They burned your flesh till you spoke."
He rolled up his right sleeve and pushed it a little beyond the elbow. An
uneven dark brown patch of flesh sat in ugly contrast to his pale skin.
"They tied copper wire around your arms and gave high-voltage shocks.
Every hair on your body stood up. But the worst was when they inserted
the copper wire into my penis and gave electric shocks. They did it with
most boys. It destroyed many lives. Many could not marry after that."

After his release, Ansar was treated for urinary tract infections and
some other disorders he did not mention. "I was not ready to marry. But
my family supported me in a big way. I agreed to marry only after I was
treated for a year and a half. Thank God, now I have a daughter and run
my small business."

After leaving Ansar, I kept thinking about the attacks on the boys'
masculinity, which had left them vulnerable even after the prison sentence
was over. I tried to write about _Papa-2_ but failed. I stared at my
computer screen, typed and deleted a few words, and switched it off.

A forgotten memory returned. A few years ago I had met with a
teacher from my middle school. His family name was Khatana, and he
taught us Urdu poetry. I was passionate about Urdu poetry, attended
all his classes, and was his favorite student. But I left that school, left
Kashmir, and forgot all about him.. Meeting him after almost a decade,
I had asked him about his family, his work. He was teaching in a different
school and had not married. During a raid on his village, he had
been arrested and tortured. "The bastards destroyed me. I have had three
unsuccessful operations on my testicles. So no chance of a marriage,
really," he told me. Later I wondered why, at that moment, I failed to
understand the import of what he had told me. I wanted to meet him
again and called friends to ask about him. Nobody seemed to know
where he was.

A few days later, I called Shahid, a doctor friend at Srinagar's premier
medical institute, Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, and
talked to him about Ansar. "We have had hundreds of cases here. Those
electric shocks led to impotence in many, and many lost their kidneys,"
he said. Shahid, a short, jolly man, grew up in a South Kashmir village.
On weekends he drove up to his ancestral village and spent his Sundays
treating the villagers for a nominal fee. "I am going home on Sunday.
If you can come along, I will introduce you to someone with the same
problem."

On Sunday morning I set out with Shahid to his village to meet his
cousin Hussein, who, after being tortured in detention, thought he was
impotent and refused to marry. "The problem is that he is not ready to
meet a doctor. He does not even talk to me," Shahid told me as we drove
from Srinagar toward the South Kashmir town of Bijbehara. We turned
onto a dirt track near the town and for half an hour passed through clusters
of mud-and-brick houses, groves of walnut and willow trees, and
fields. Vapor rose from the frost-covered fields warmed by the bright
morning sun. "The sun is so rejuvenating," Shahid said in his physician's
manner.

A hand-painted Red Cross sign hanging from a roadside shack with
his name misspelled announced Shahid's clinic. It was barely nine in
the morning, and a crowd of patients was already waiting for him. Hussein,
his cousin, was there. Hussein had gentle eyes and a subdued manner.
We sat at an empty shop front in the sun. I offered him a cigarette,
which he reluctantly accepted.

Hussein seemed to have surrendered to his fate. I struggled to find
the right words. Sexuality was almost never discussed in our culture,
and impotence was even harder to talk about. I began telling him about
Shafi, Ansar, _Papa-2_, and the medical correction of torture-imposed disorders.
He listened in silence, for the most part expressionless. Finally,
he began to talk about his experience.

He was in the first year of college when the armed militancy began in 1990.
He was the eldest son of a teacher and had four siblings. One day
he left home with a group of thirteen other young men. After spending
three days in the North Kashmir town of Baramulla, they boarded a
truck and drove toward the town of Kupwara, near the _Line of Control_.
Halfway from Kupwara, the Border Security Force stopped them. Their
guide sat with the driver on the front seat; Hussein and his friends sat
on the bare floor in the back. They had agreed to pose as construction laborers, but they were arrested and taken to a nearby paramilitary
camp.

In the morning Hussein and his group were taken into tiny tin sheds
lit by bright electric lamps for interrogation. "I was asked to undress, be
naked. The first time I resisted, was beaten, undressed forcibly, and tied
to a chair. Then they tied copper wire to my arms and gave me electric
shocks. I could not even scream. They had stuffed my mouth with a ball
of cloth. I thought I would die. They would suddenly stop, take the cloth
out, and ask questions. I fainted a few times. They brought me back to
my senses and inserted a copper wire into my penis. Then they switched
on the electricity." Most of them broke after two days of torture. "You
cannot bear pain beyond a point. Everybody talks," Hussein said. "We
admitted we were going for arms training and were shifted to jails in
Srinagar after two weeks." He added as an afterthought, "Maybe I should
have admitted straightaway. Life could have been different."

I closed my eyes and then opened them and looked away, out at the
road and the patients awaiting their turn at Shahid's clinic. An old man
walked up to us and asked whether I was a doctor. "No, sir. I am only
the doctor's friend." The old man told me about his high blood pressure
because of the situation" and left.

Hussein and I walked down the road leading out of the village through
the fields. There was no traffic. Hussein walked slowly, lost in thought.
We sat on a parapet by the road. Hussein lit a cigarette and resumed his
story. "I can't tell you about the pain one feels when they gave the electric
shocks. I thought I would die. At times I think every shock lasted a
minute or two; at times it seemed an hour," he said.

After his interrogators threw him back in his cell, Hussein kept losing
consciousness. "At least during the blackouts, I felt no pain." He was
bleeding when he urinated, his penis had swollen, and pain crawled up it
like a leech. When he was moved to the detention center at Srinagar, an
infection had set in, and he saw pus and blood in his urine. There was no
medical aid for weeks. "Then a Sikh paramilitary officer asked me about
my condition. I told him what had happened. He was an angel; he got me
some medicine, cotton, and Dettol antiseptic lotion. That helped a lot."
It made me think of what Ansar and Shafi had told me about different
interrogators: "Some were sadists and some were decent men." Hussein
was silent again. I asked him whether he knew the Sikh officer's name
or had been able to maintain contact. "Unfortunately, I do not know his
name. I did not see him after a few weeks. I think he was transferred."

Hussein was released from jail after two years. A year afterward he
began running a small business dealing in carpets and shawls. One day
he decided to tell his family about his impotence. He had not spoken
about it to anyone. That night he did not sleep till he heard the morning
call to prayer. "I went to the mosque, prayed, and broke down while
asking God for help. Only He knew what I had been through." Walking
back home from the mosque, he felt stronger and decided to talk to
his brother-in-law, a schoolteacher. His brother-in-law advised him to
see a doctor. "For a year I went to various doctors at the Anantnag district
hospital; they wrote a long list of medicines, but they did not help
much." Shahid wanted to take him to the Medical Institute at Srinagar.
Hussein was not comfortable talking to Shahid. He refused to meet any
more doctors and spent his days running a small grocery and praying at
the village mosque.

His family gave up till another crisis arrived --- his younger brothers
were getting married. In Kashmiri tradition, a younger brother does
not get married before the elder. Hussein's father, brother-in-law, and
uncles tried to convince him again. The village was talking about it:
"Why isn't their elder son getting married when the younger ones are?
Is something wrong with him? They say something happened to him in
the jail." Hussein insisted his younger siblings go ahead with their lives.
They did. Hussein played with their kids. "It is hard at times. But I simply
do not think of a life with someone." Hussein's voice could not hide his
longing.

We walked back to the clinic. I turned to him and said, "Hussein,
you will be all right. Your condition is curable." I told Hussein about
Ansar's marriage and his three-year-old daughter; I told him about the
urological surgeries I had read about, about the drugs, about psychiatric
counseling, about him being a brave man, about faith, about Prophet
Muhammad saying that hopelessness is a crime. We reached the clinic
and entered Shahid's mud-walled, bare-floored clinic. We waited till the
patient he was examining left. I turned to Hussein and urged him to
talk to his doctor cousin. He looked into my eyes and smiled. "I will.
Thanks." We shook hands, and I walked out of the clinic.
