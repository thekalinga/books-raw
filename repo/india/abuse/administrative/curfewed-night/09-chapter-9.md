## I See You Again

I had begun to think seriously about returning to Kashmir, where
far grimmer things were happening. I had shared some stories with
a few friends in Delhi, but I could never say everything. I would
find myself stopping in the middle of a sentence, rendered inarticulate
by memory. The telling, even in the shade of intimacy, was painful. And
a sense of shame overcame me every time I walked into a bookstore.
People from almost every conflict zone had told their stories: Palestinians,
Israelis, Bosnians, Kurds, Tibetans, Lebanese, East Germans, Africans,
East Timorese, and many more. I felt the absence of the unwritten
books of the Kashmiri experience. The memories and stories of Kashmir
that I had carried with me could fade away. I had to find the words to
save them from the callous varnish of time. I had to write. And to write,
I had to return and revisit the people and places that had haunted me for
years.

Among the few literary responses to Kashmir, the poems of Kashmiri--American
poet Agha Shahid Ali were the foremost. I often turned to his
verses, which evoked the fear, the tension, the anger, and the hopelessness
of our experience. I had met Shahid only in his books --- _Country Without
a Post Office, Half-Inch Himalayas_, and _Rooms Are Never Finished_. I had seen
him smile from wooden frames in his elegant house in southern Srinagar
and watched his father, Agha Ashraf Ali, a retired professor, entertain
a constant flow of visitors curious to hear about his poet son. Shahid
had died of cancer in 2001 in Brooklyn. Newspapers in Kashmir printed
his poems every other day in the autumn of 2001, during his final days.
Prayers for him rose from all the mosques of Kashmir.

I caught glimpses of Shahid the man from an essay that his friend
the novelist Amitav Ghosh wrote in _The Nation_. One day Ghosh accompanied
Shahid and his siblings to a hospital for one of his many unsuccessful
surgeries. Shahid tried to walk on his own but fell and had to be
put in a wheelchair. Ghosh wrote, "When the hospital orderly returned
with the wheelchair Shahid gave him a beaming smile and asked where
he was from. Ecuador, the man said, and Shahid clapped his hands gleefully
together. 'Spanish!' he cried, at the top of his voice. 'I always
wanted to learn Spanish. Just to read Lorca.' At this the tired, slack-shouldered
orderly came suddenly to life. 'Lorca? Did you say Lorca?'
He quoted a few lines, to Shahid's great delight. 'Ah! "_La Cinque de la
Tarde_,"' Shahid cried, rolling the syllables gleefully around his tongue.

'How I love those words. "_La Cinque de la Tarde_"!'

To me, Shahid continued to speak from the black lettering:

>I write on that void:
>
>Kashmir, Kaschmir, Cashmere, Qashmir,
>
>Cashmir, Cashmire, Kashmere, Cachemire,
>
>Cushmeer, Cachmiere, Casmir

One summer afternoon one of my editors called me to discuss possible
story ideas. I found myself telling him I was going to resign. He
offered me a raise. But I was going home. I was going to Kashmir. My
editor wished me luck.

That night I did not set my alarm clock. I spent the next few weeks
buying books: books I badly wanted to read, books I had heard about,
and books I had never heard about. Discussions with friends and hard
goodbyes followed.

A quick look at my savings had ruled out the possibility of flying. A
few weeks later, I left with my bags to catch a bus to Kashmir. The setting
sun lit the sandstone domes and minarets of the Red Fort. Local
buses and cars screeched by; cargo-laden rickshaws pulled by sunburned,
sweat-drenched men negotiated their way. The rickshaw driver stopped
by a row of tin shacks with gaudy travel operator signs running parallel
to the ramparts of the fort. Touts pounced upon weary passengers. They
acted with such ferocity that I wondered whether they thought of their
potbellied bosses sitting behind the wooden desks of travel offices as
incarnations of Mughal emperors.

I ignored the touts, lit a cigarette, and took slow, deliberate puffs
while scanning the signs. "Are you a Kashmiri?" a wiry man with disheveled
curly hair and a beaklike nose asked. I smiled back. Both his nose
and his question were very Kashmiri. The question asked in Kashmiri
was a greeting, a question one Kashmiri asks another Kashmiri in any
situation, in any corner of the world, the moment he realizes his companion
is from Kashmir. I have answered and asked this question. It
comes with an informal smile and more questions aimed at placing you
in Kashmir.

Ramesh was a Hindu from the Budgam district in central Kashmir.
His family had migrated to Delhi in the early nineties. He lived in a slum
in South Delhi. I had been there as a reporter. Ramesh lived in a shabby
municipal building that lay abandoned for years before the Delhi government
settled the Kashmiri Pandit migrants there. Tattered curtains, tied
by nylon strings to the nails in the walls, served as partitions between
a do or so families of five to six each. Outside the building, women
had erected makeshift kitchens in the courtyard. The stench from the
community toilets could not be kept at bay. Ramesh complained about
the heat in Delhi. He missed his village in Kashmir; his eyes spoke of
the shade of willows, the cold streams, and the apple orchards where he
had grown up. "You are lucky, you are going home," he said. The touts
were lurking, eyeing potential customers. They seemed to remind him
of something; he was not at ease.

"Are you all right?" I asked.

"Yes. We got talking and I forgot about work."

"You work here?"

"Yes. I earn a commission for every passenger I take to the travel
agency," he said in a lowered voice. He had hoped to get me to buy a
ticket from his agency.

I looked at his somber face. "I want a ticket to Srinagar. Let us get it."

Ramesh got me the ticket for an air-cooled deluxe coach. The bus
would arrive in ten minutes and leave in half an hour. I sat on a wooden
bench outside the travel agency. We shook hands, and Ramesh left in
search of passengers. I watched his lean frame move slowly toward the
main road as he looked for potential passengers. He waved at incoming
rickshaws, accosted people with travel bags, and disappeared into the
crowd.

A battered white bus came in half an hour. The traffic outside had
lessened; a dark night covered Delhi, and streetlights rose like artificial
moons. We needed five more passengers before the bus could move. I
got out of the bus and strolled about. I was worried about how my family
would react to my decision to leave my job and my ideas of writing.
I went over various versions of my plans to travel in Kashmir, revisit
places and people, and write about them. I had my own fear to deal with
as well. Maybe I was making a mistake? Maybe I should have waited longer
and prepared myself better? The bus eventually took off. It would be
a long ride --- twenty-seven hours.

I woke up quite late in the morning. By midafternoon, the bus had
dragged itself on the serpentine highway running through the high
mountains. We were about to enter the valley of Kashmir when Indian
army trucks with nets thrown over their roofs began passing by regularly.
Soldiers in camouflage and bulletproof jackets and caps patrolled
the road, their rifles pointed aggressively at some unseen enemy. Waving
the barrel of his assault rifle, a soldier ordered us to stop. A passenger
jeered: "Welcome to Kashmir."

We were at the Banihal tunnel, which had been bored through the
mountain by Swiss engineers in 1953. Across the tunnel lies the valley of
Kashmir. Two soldiers boarded the bus and began checking our luggage;
we walked in a queue toward a sandbagged check post. One by one we
entered, our hands raised. The soldiers stared at our identity cards and
frisked us. There was a strange familiarity to this ritual. It was oppressive
and intimate at the same time. In some perverse way, it signaled reaching
home.

The bus entered the two-mile-long misty tunnel, barely lit by sodium
lamps. The groan of the engine and the song of the tires echoed against
the dark, rocky walls. Ten minutes seemed very long. Then the tunnel
opening appeared as a blinding semicircle of light.

I opened the window, rose on my toes, and popped my head out
the window: Kashmir! There she was: the bluest of the skies over the
browns, greens, and blues of the million-inch Himalayas. The bus
swerved around a bend, and she was a wide valley spreading out in a
gentle wave of paddy fields toward a majestic arc of mountains. The
breeze healed me of the Indian summer. I stretched my neck, and my
eyes wandered over the peaks, seeking the range I'd grown up with. I
saw the mountains that hid my village and the taller, bluer range near
my school. The metaled road fell like a black ribbon toward the valley;
tall, elegant poplars by the roadside and shorter, greener willows along
the wedges of the paddies stood in neat rows as the bus passed village
after village of small, tin-roofed brick and wood houses. The dying sun
glinted on the roof of a mosque, shopkeepers pulled down their shutters,
bus conductors shouted names of villages and called their residents
for the journey home, and children waved at the faces half glimpsed
through a bus window.

An hour and a half later, I was entering Srinagar. Modern Srinagar
began with the largest military camp in Kashmir: Badami Bagh, the garden
of almonds, on the highway connecting Srinagar to the southern
province of Jammu. It lay facing a shabby market of tea stalls, tailors, and
grocery shops and was surrounded by high concrete walls, rows of iron
barricades, sandbag bunkers, and alert soldiers in bulletproof jackets.
Along the highway stood a row of military vehicles; a little ahead, three
stray dogs and a bull fought over the right to sniff the rubbish and look
for leftovers. The dogs barked at the bull; the bull swayed his horns at
them.

The sun had set, the shops were closed, and soldiers patrolled the
roads. The closed iron shutters of the shops stared across Lal Chowk.
Flamboyant signs announcing the names of the stores had mellowed in
the night. A few rickshaws were parked on the corner of Lambert Lane,
branching off the main square. The faint sulfur rays of a streetlight fell
on the drivers huddled along the stairs of an astrologer's office. Farther
ahead, past an armored military vehicle, the empty avenue bordered by
chinar trees led to a watchtower whose clock had stopped working.

I boarded a rickshaw, a green-and-black golf cart --- like three-wheeler
that thrived in the space between the bus and the cab. The driver
switched on a bulb that washed us in a bright yellow light. You always
switched on that bulb to let the soldiers see you. The Armed Forces Special
Powers Act, a law introduced by the Indian government, gave all
Indian soldiers posted in Kashmir the power to shoot any person suspected
of being a threat. It also provided them immunity from prosecution
in a court of law. Passing by in a rickshaw without a bulb could raise
fatal suspicion in a patrol. We drove through empty roads and streets,
stopped at check posts, showed my identity card, and opened my bags.
The rickshaw drove on through streets without streetlights; faint glows
of candles and kerosene lamps lit the houses. Stray dogs barked and
whined as I entered my father's house.

Over the next few weeks, I introduced the idea of book writing to
my father. He had recently acquired an Internet connection; in the process
of teaching him to Web surf, I took him on a virtual tour of various
literary magazines and journals. "They make much more sense than the
newspapers," Father pronounced after a few weeks. But he was stunned
when I told him, "That is what I want to try. I want to write about our
life and society like this. In fact, I have quit my job to do just that." He
stared at the computer screen, displaying an interview with the great
Polish poet-reporter Ryszard Kapuściński in a literary magazine. Father
asked me to shut down the computer. "It is quite late now." He walked
slowly out of my room. He would have to explain to our nosy relatives
and his friends why his grown-up son did not go to an office or have a
regular job like most people his age.

I spent my first few days catching up with old friends. One of those
days we received an invitation for a wedding. As usual, the words on the
card read: _MARRIAGES ARE MADE IN HEAVEN; THEY ARE ONLY CELEBRATED ON
EARTH_. Ashraf, a neighbor's son in my village, was getting married. He'd
been a tall, skinny boy when we played cricket in the neighborhood
threshing field as children. Now he assisted a contractor who built parapets,
roads, and bridges. "He personally dropped the invitation here.
You have to go," Mother said.

It had been many years since I had stayed in our house in the village.
First my studies and later my work had kept me away. After the mine
blast, my parents had moved to Srinagar, and I usually stayed there during
my visits.

I caught the bus to Anantnag the next day. The road to my village
reminded me of the pictures of Kosovo. The government, in a bid to
widen the road and offer better facilities to the tourists visiting Pahalgam
--- the hill station a few hours ahead --- had demolished most houses
on both sides of the road. Multicolored marble tiles that had decorated
kitchens and bathroom walls stared at me through the hollows made
by strokes of the government bulldozers. My village seemed to have
changed a lot; new houses had come up on the fields outside the village.

The new house my grandfather had built was one of them. But our
mountains --- a gently rolling arc of pine a mile away and higher, sharp,
rocky cliffs in the distance --- were the same, the empty terraces of harvested
rice fields, the conical golden haystacks dotting them, and the
hum of the Lidder stream beyond brought back the sounds of my childhood.
I spent my first evening walking leisurely amid our fields and apple
orchards, watched them change shades as the sun moved farther west.
Here I had learned to speak, walk, read, write, run, swear, and play. Here
I had slept my best sleep.

I woke up late the next morning. In a replay of the scenes from my
childhood, Grandfather knocked on the door of my room. His tone had
changed from the scary shout to a mellow whisper. After a round of
noon chai, we set out for our old neighborhood. "Ashraf is now earning
a decent sum, so his family decided to get him married," Grandfather
said. We reached the narrow alley leading to his house. The old house of
mud bricks and a thatched roof was decorated with miniature lights in
green, yellow, and red plastic covers. A shimmering white tent stood in
the courtyard.

Ashraf sat on a chair amid a crowd of women and children. He looked
elegant in collared _kurta_ pajamas over which he wore a black vest. He
spotted me standing in a corner. He rose from his seat; we met with a
hug and a laugh. "So you are getting married today!" I said. He smiled
and said, "One has to marry sooner or later." He held my hand and took
me toward his seat. "I am very happy you came. It has been a long time."
I sat next to Ashraf on a chair someone brought in a hurry. The girls sang
at a high pitch. Boys with pimpled faces shaved with much care kept
finding excuses to stand around the groom and steal glances at the girls.
Busy-looking men in loose, collared _kurta_ pajamas shouted orders that
went mostly unheard. Ashraf had to get a haircut before leaving for the
bride's house. The local barber arrived with his kit. As the barber set to
work, I left to meet the elders.

Behind the house, a narrow alley had been converted into a make-shift
kitchen. Food was cooked in copper pots resting on a bonfire lit
between two brick rows. The elders had settled themselves in chairs to
supervise and chat. My old neighbors and relatives had been permanent
characters in my world once. There was Ashraf's father, Khazer, a short,
wiry man who always wore a skull cap to hide his bald head and would
give me a piece of _jaggery_ (candy) whenever I went to their house. There
was his uncle Amjad, who always looked about to die and used to ask
children to thump his back to relieve him of the backache; I often hit
him a bit too hard, running away before he could hit me with his equally
aged cane. Among the young men helping out was Nissar, a childhood
friend. A bald man sat on a _pategih_, a mat woven from hay, puffing a hookah.
It was Bashir, our neighborhood grocer, at whose expense I'd had
some insensitive laughs in the early days of the conflict.

I watched Bashir from a distance. I was happy to see him after many
years, happy to see he had survived. He almost jumped from his seat
when I greeted him. "God! You have grown up, really grown up!" He
hugged me and shook my hand repeatedly. We sat together, and he
told me about his daughter's marriage. "You did not come for Alia's
marriage." He sounded hurt. I explained, "I was in Delhi, tied up with
work." He asked about me, and I gave the standard answers. But something
worried me; his manner had changed. He used the formal language
and reverential manner we used for guests. I went on to meet Khazer,
Amjad, Nissar, and others. I had expected the old informality, but they,
too, treated me like a guest. Khazer told me to sit in a room reserved for
guests. When I volunteered to do some chores, Amjad stopped me. Nissar,
who had never left the village, carried plates and served the guests.
The chores that neighborhood youth helped with were not for me now.

I had been away in different places and lived a different life. But
every time I filled out a form asking for a permanent address, I wrote:
_Seer Hamdan, Anantnag, Kashmir_. Though bad with numbers, I never forgot
the postal code of my village: 192129. I could not forget the village post
office, with its smoke billowing out of the rusted tin pipe of a _bukhari_,
the dusty maroon billboard, and the khaki-clad postal clerks. And Ramji,
our postman, who I thought had been born old, with his uncombed salt-and-pepper
hair falling on his wrinkled face beneath which shoulders
drooped over a wiry frame. In the morning he repaired cooking stoves
near the butcher's shop, and in the afternoon he went around the village
on his bicycle, hanging his jute bag on his left shoulder, ringing the bell
and stopping wherever he had to deliver a letter. The village children
ran after him, shouting in a chorus, "Is there a letter for me, Ramji?"
until he was irritated and chased us away. The letters Ramji delivered had
no house numbers, no street names. They had your name, your father's
name, and the name of the village. Ramji knew everyone; the letters
reached their addressees. I do not get any mail at that address anymore.
But still, whenever I fill out a form, faces of that lost world beckon me.

Till the mid-eighties, nobody had a telephone; a couple of families
used to have a television. People often gathered at Gani Haji, the _tonga
wallah_'s house, to watch television. He had been to Mecca for Hajj, the
Islamic pilgrimage, and brought back a black-and-white television set.
Almost everybody with some weight assembled at Haji's house. The
television set used to be in a ground-floor room, and you could see it
through a window. Before our families got television sets in the latter
part of the eighties, my friend Aafaiz and I often climbed on each other's
shoulders to get the view through the window.

Radio told us the news, and newspapers were rare. Then the meaning
of news was different. It did not mean the daily body count that it
became after 1990. News was not about self-determination, sovereignty,
or terrorism; about summits, strategies, and geopolitics; about fundamentalism,
tolerance, and secularism. News was made in places nobody
from our village had been. News was not about us. I remember returning
home one day with a copy of the largest-selling English-language newspaper
in India, the _Times of India_, from Anantnag. Before I could get home,
a bunch of village elders who idled at a shop near our house called me
over. I had to show them the newspaper; they gaped at the printed words
and the newspaper pictures. Since it was an English paper, I was asked
to read it out loud and translate as well. Over a decade had passed since
that day in the mid-eighties. The elders had grown older; the children
were young men. Amjad and Uncle Khazer still gossiped at the same
shop with other men. Newspapers came regularly to our village. Every
rooftop flaunted a television antenna. There were three cable television
operators in the village, offering fifty television channels, including
BBC, CNN, and various Indian news channels, for ninety rupees a
month. People watched the news and read the newspapers. News was
about us, too, now. Aafaiz, my friend from the days when there was only
one television in the entire village, ran a cable network.

Night fell, and after dinner Ashraf was brought into the tent. It was
the night of henna tattoos: _maenziraat_. Women and girls circled him
and sang the traditional wedding songs. His mother applied henna to
his smallest finger; friends and relatives took pictures with the groom.
I decided against sleep; this was an occasion of Kashmiri songs sung
with fervor to the beats of a _tumbaknaer_, an earthen drumlike instrument
covered with goatskin on one end, which the women beat deftly. The
tent boomed with the voices of women and girls in shiny, embroidered
clothes, singing a Kashmiri classic:

>Hooreh Chayyih Wanwaan Nooreh Mahraazo
>
>Aakho Shahrekih Sheerazo Aakho Shahrekih Sheerazo
>
>(Hour is sing for the angel-faced groom,
>
>He is the jewel of the city)

An hour later, some teenagers brought two speakers and a CD player
into the tent. Most of them wore knockoffs of Calvin Klein, Lee, and
Levi's jeans and T-shirts. Two boys with gym-pumped bodies in acrylic
shirts saying _HERO_ and _SPORTY_ set up the system. Loud blasts of Hindi film
music drowned out the traditional songs. A few old women protested.
Girls blushed with happiness and formed a circle around the boys,
who danced to a Bollywood hit. Slowly, the women moved closer and
watched with awe the boys gyrating self-consciously to the Hindi songs.
The loud music, the mediocre lyrics, and the Bollywood dance moves
had overrun the traditional celebration.

In the morning Ashraf's father told me to sit with the men who were
to accompany Ashraf to the bride's house, where the _nikah_ --- the signing
of the wedding contract, with two witnesses on each side --- was to be
held, followed by _wazawaan_, the traditional Kashmiri cuisine of thirty-six
varieties of meat. It was meant only for close relatives and special
guests.

I wandered for a while through the lanes, catching glimpses of my
past everywhere until I found myself in the courtyard of a double-storied
tin-roofed house. There were no children on its lawn; there was
no cow with black spots on its white hide tied to a peg in a corner,
thoughtfully chewing the grass, nor did a blue bicycle lie next to the
cowshed. Its cemented boundary wall was new to my eyes. The woman
curiously eyeing me from the kitchen window was a stranger. "Who are
you looking for?" she asked. I did not know what to say. I was looking
for myself; the house she now owned was the house I was born in. It was
the home whose memories I carried with me. It was my eternal home in
thought, transferred by ownership deed.

Ashraf was preparing to leave for his bride's house. He wore a light
brown suit, brown leather shoes, and white headgear embroidered with
silver thread. Two marigold garlands and three garlands of ten-rupee
notes hung around his neck. The men and women who would accompany
him were all hanging around in the courtyard. There was the usual
talk about who would be next and how, after the fighting began, the
average marriage age in Kashmir had gone from the mid-twenties to the
early thirties. Ashraf was thirty-two, his bride thirty. Delays in education
and difficulties finding work kept pushing the wedding dates back,
much to the annoyance of impatient parents and grandparents. It had
become especially worrisome for girls' parents; most of the dead were
young men, and thousands more had injuries, depression, and nonexistent
careers.

Women and girls formed a circle, held hands, and sang. They moved
back and forth, tapped their feet, shook their heads, raised and lowered
their voices. It was an old custom practiced before the groom left for
the bride's house after sunset, returning after a late dinner. Kashmiris
discarded that centuries-old tradition after the evening of May 16, 1990,
when Indian paramilitaries fired upon a marriage party and raped the
bride.
