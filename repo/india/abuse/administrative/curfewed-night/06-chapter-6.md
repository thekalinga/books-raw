## A Close Call

On my first day in the city, I walked through Connaught
Place, an elegant circular arcade in the center of Delhi. I
was overwhelmed. The buildings seemed too big, the roads
too busy. It was a scorching June day; there was no breeze, no shade.
Diesel buses left clouds of smoke. But I had a sense of freedom, a feeling
that I could teach myself what I needed to learn. I spent most of
my first year at the law school reading literature and journalism. Delhi
had numerous libraries and a fabulous used-book bazaar on Sundays. In
mid-2000 I left law school and found my first job with a news website.
After my very first week, with some lessons from my editors, I was sent
out to cover Delhi. I tried, failed, tried again, and began learning to
survive as a reporter.

My reporting job required me to travel a lot throughout the city. I
was losing my patience with the crowded Delhi buses. After receiving
my first paycheck, I bought an old motorcycle from a colleague. "You
have to be quick. It is breaking news," my news editor would shout.
Delhi was all about running faster than everyone else. I often thought
of Ruskin Bond when I stopped my motorcycle at a traffic light. "In
Delhi you are either the first or you are lost," Bond wrote. I did not
want to be lost. As the traffic lights turned green I would release the
clutch, wind the accelerator to the maximum, and shoot ahead of the
crowd.

I lived in a garret on the roof of a South Delhi house, a mile away from
my office. After work, when I was not reading, I hung out with friends at
a university near my rented room. The university was and remains one
of the few politically tolerant spaces in New Delhi. The Delhi police had
over the years earned a reputation for fake encounters with Kashmiri
terrorists. I understood why I had been sent to the decaying provisional
Muslim university and not to a college in Delhi.

Slowly, I learned to like Delhi. I was also beginning to understand the
various Indias that existed, Indias that I liked and cared about, Indias that
were unlike the militaristic power I'd seen in Kashmir. India had opened
its economy in the early 1990s. Round-the-clock channels broadcast
news, and the number of magazines was growing. Young anchors and
reporters asked victims of tragedies questions like "So, how does it feel?"
in a faux American accent. The newly moneyed capital of India began to
pride itself on its special DJ nights and malls featuring Levi's showrooms
and Nokia outlets. Thousands of Toyotas ferried call-center executives
for night shifts at the suburban BPO offices, among them a flatmate of
mine, a boy from a small southern Indian town who had been told to jettison
his Indian name. He would tell me about his job and begin acting
out his calls: "Hi! This is Jack Smith calling from JCPenney!"

The old India and its power structures did not disappear. My neighborhood
was full of students from small towns and villages, living very austere
lives and preparing for the competition, or the "civils" --- the Indian
civil services examination. They dredged through tedious manuals and
textbooks for four, five, even six years, fortifying themselves with cheap
Old Monk rum and staring at the whitewashed ceilings of those claustrophobic
rooms and dreaming of sitting behind the chair of a district
magistrate, surrounded by armed guards, servants, drivers obsequiously
lapping to attention at every whim, a bungalow, a white ambassador car
with a siren and flashing red light, and in a few years holding the power
to administer an entire district --- often with hundreds of villages and
more than a million people. In the heart of Delhi, near Jantar Mantar
Street, I saw almost every day groups of India's powerless --- people sitting
on the footpaths with cloth banners or cardboard placards, seeking
official attention for their woes, for the injustices they lived with. India
was grotesque and fascinating.

Delhi was beginning to be a second home. Maybe a city feels like
home when you know there will be a person or two who will come to
the airport or the railway station to greet you, when you know there are
people you want to meet as you arrive. I might have forgotten Kashmir
--- it might have turned into a place I visited every two or three months
--- but I could not. Kashmir was the text and subtext of my professional,
personal, and social worlds in Delhi. Kashmir was the death count in the
newspapers: Almost every day I woke up to the news of a mine blast, a
gun battle and the rubble of a destroyed home, a protest against a custodial
killing in Kashmir. I hoped I would never have to read the names of
people I loved the most in those reports of deaths.

One day I almost ran out of luck. I was covering Delhi courts for the
news website I worked for. On May 14, 2001, the London-based Indian
business tycoons the Hinduja brothers were being tried in India for their
alleged involvement in the Bofors scam, a 1980s graft scandal involving
the purchase of arms for the Indian military. The hearings were held in
a North Delhi court complex --- Tis Hazari. It was a very hot day. I was
sweating the minute I stepped outdoors. The courtroom was pretty far,
and my editor had asked me to take an office cab instead of my rickety
motorcycle. The air-conditioning in the car made the prospect of
going to the court appealing. An hour later, the driver parked outside
the monstrous concrete court complex. I walked in to find the familiar
crowd of reporters whiling away time with cups of tea and the retelling
of court reporter jokes. The hearing began around one-thirty, after two
hours of waiting in the heat.

I found a place near the witness box where two of the Hinduja
brothers stood in their gray suits and square seventies-style spectacles,
sweating under the leisurely, noisy motions of an antique ceiling fan.
A reporter joked about equality under law, how the ill-paid reporters
and the billionaire Hindujas sweated under the same fan. As the case
proceeded, a vague sadness overcame me. I was restless, uninterested
in the trial. I tried taking notes and failed. I felt breathless and decided
to leave. Fifteen minutes later, I made my way through the crowd and
sneaked out of the courtroom.

My office was in a crowded shopping complex dominated by huge
Benetton, Reebok, and Adidas stores. A TGIF stood next to a new multiplex.
A small independent bookstore was almost hidden in this glitter of
billboards and the nonchalant noise of Delhi's rich kids. I walked past
the shop and took the stairs to my office on the top floor. "How was
the story, Basharat?" said Ramesh, my editor and mentor, the moment I
entered the office. I told him I'd had to walk out.

"Don't worry. It is the goddamn heat," he said. Ramesh fidgeted with
some files, then put a hand on my shoulder. He seemed disturbed, trying
hard to be composed. "There was a call for you from Mukhtar \[the Srinagar
reporter\]. Please call him back right away."

I dialed the number. Mukhtar picked up the phone on the second
ring. He made some small talk about my work. And then: "Basharat,
your parents were traveling back from a wedding at your uncle's village.
There was a mine blast on the road. Thank God they are safe. I just spoke
to them. Please call them."

_Parents. Mine blast. Safe._ I registered the words and held the receiver.
Ramesh stood in silence. _Parents. Mine blast. Safe._ It was as if someone had
punched my heart. I sat on the office floor and rested my head against a
stack of newspapers. I cried. My colleagues stood around me, silent, sad.
I gathered myself in a few minutes and called home. I spoke to my parents
for a long time. I was going home.

There were no flights till the next morning, and I had to take an overnight
bus. First I had to meet Wajahat. His university was a few minutes
from my office.

I walked toward my rust-colored Kawasaki motorcycle, parked in a
long line of scooters and motorcycles, and turned on the gas and the
ignition. I tried to kick-start it, and nothing happened. I kicked again,
and the machine whined. I tried harder, and the old engine groaned to
life briefly. I felt I would fall; my hands were shaking, and my legs felt
very weak, as if some giant syringe had sucked every ounce of blood
out of me. I struggled with putting the motorcycle back on the stand
and holding my helmet in my lap and sat on a cemented parking divider,
smoking, thinking how to tell Wajahat.

As I navigated the streets on my bike, images of my parents came to
my mind: leaving a hospital with an arm in a cast and getting a bottle of
Campa cola and a Five Star chocolate from Father; walking with him to
the Royal bookseller near his office and buying Batman comics; drinking
tea and talking poetry at home; receiving a seven-page letter from
him upon publishing my first story in a Delhi newspaper. And Mother:
staying awake throughout the nights I had fever; finding a packet of cigarettes
in my trousers when I was home from college and keeping my
secret; insisting that I wear proper clothes, making half-serious inquiries
about marriage after I began working.

I stopped at the open-air café near Wajahat's dorm. Small groups of
young people sat along the road and on blocks of concrete along the
slope of the café. Many more stood in a line waiting for tea and snacks
at the counter and at the tiny cigarette and betel nut shop next door.
Others hung about the public phone booth. I lived across the road from
the university and often met Wajahat and a few other friends there. He
was with a group of people closer to the café counter. I walked slowly
past groups of students immersed in loud, passionate discussions about
politics, casually laughing and flirting.

Wajahat and his friends sat in a circle; half-empty paper cups lay on
a block of stone in the middle, and smoke rose from a few cigarettes.
Wajahat held a cotton towel in his left hand. His long, wavy hair was
soaked with sweat. He always had a towel on hand to keep sweat from
dripping onto his contact lenses. He saw me from a distance and said
something; his friends laughed. They often made lighthearted comments
comparing my "pedestrian" reporting job to their critical readings
of Hegel and Kant in the air-conditioned library.

Wajahat grinned. "Mr. Reporter, what's up?"

"Oh! The usual grind!" I sat down and took a few moments to fortify
myself. "We have to call home." My voice was uneven, shaky.

His face stiffened, and he stood up. "What happened?" His eyes were
grave, apprehensive. His friends circled us.

"Everyone is fine. Mummy and Daddy were coming back from a wedding
at Salia. There was a mine blast on the road. They are safe at home
now, but it was very close." Wajahat sat down. I held him. "We should
call them now."

I put my arm around his shoulder and pushed him into the phone
booth from where one could make long-distance calls. A fan hanging
from a wall whirled in vain against the blistering May heat. Wajahat held
the door ajar, and I dialed home. The phone began to ring. I gave him the
receiver and stood behind him, my hand on his shoulder. He talked on
the phone as if in a daze. When he hung up, we embraced.

"We have to go home," he said.

"Yes. We have to," I replied.

Wajahat had an exam in a few days.

"I will go now," I said decisively. "And you will come after your
exam."

He was silent, thinking, tears welling up in his eyes. "I will come
with you," he said. "I will drop the exam."

"No! You can't. They are safe. You will come after the exam. Let's talk
to Mummy again. If she says yes, you can come."

"You know she won't let me."

"Let's call her."

Mother and father insisted that Wajahat take his exam. I took an
overnight bus to Jammu, a flight from there to Srinagar, and a cab home
from the airport. I remember nothing else.

The cab stopped outside the house. Many cars were parked along the
road; I stood there for a moment, looking at our house, at the mountains
in the distance, seeking assurance in the familiar. I walked in. Father was
surrounded by friends, relatives, and neighbors on the lawn. A samovar
and a few trays full of cups and plates of bread and cakes lay around.
Mother was standing next to him. I was tired with the relief of being able
to see them again, grateful that I didn't have to walk into a house without
them. I felt no anger --- that came much later, after weeks. I walked
toward them, and silence fell upon the group. Father smiled from a distance
and rose from his place; Mother remained where she was. I walked
up to her and hugged her.

I said nothing. What do you say when your parents nearly get killed?

Eventually, Mother asked about Wajahat's preparation for the examination.
Father asked about my journey. We shook hands. Then we
looked at each other and hugged. There was no need to say anything.

We drank some tea. "You must take a shower and change," Father
said.

"Later." I sat with them, drinking tea, saying nothing much.

"It was a miracle," Father said.

They were at a relative's wedding in Uncle Rahman's village, three
miles from our ancestral home. The ceremonies were over by one P.M.,
and after lunch, they left in the car with two of my cousins. The car
moved out of the village, and they traveled on a narrow dirt road running
past clusters of houses built on a plateau on their right.

"I saw these two young men sitting on the plateau across the stream.
They were looking at us," Father said. "Your mother pointed at one of
them. He had something like a calculator in his hand."

The car slowed down. "We were crossing a concrete water pipe running
through the road."

Then there was a loud explosion.

"It was like a strong blast of air lifting the car."

The force of the blast pushed the car off the road. Bricks and stones
torn from the road fell on the car roof.

For a few minutes they lay huddled, waiting for possible gunfire. The
calculator Father had seen was a detonator; the two young men across
the stream had planted the mine inside the water pipe. Luckily, they had
forgotten to block one end of the pipe. The force of the explosion had
veered off toward the unblocked end of the pipe, and the car tossed in
the other direction. They escaped with minor bruises. Physics had saved
my family.

"But why you?" I asked him. He had no answers. I heard him repeating
the same question on the phone. Militants had been killing pro-India
politicians, police, or anybody whom they perceived as working against
them. But civil servants like my father, whose job was to look after daily
administration, were rarely targeted.

Over the next few days, friends and relatives brought news and the
name of the man who had convinced the militants to kill my father.
He was a man with political ambition whom my family had known for
a long time. I shall call him Iago. A month before the attack, he had
met my father in his office. Father was the head of administration for
the district and had to decide various disputes between organizations
and individuals. One of Iago's rivals, also a man with political ambition,
had applied in my father's office for a certain permit. Iago wanted
the permission denied. Father told Iago that, legally, his rival had the
right to that permission. "But you can skirt around that if you want. It
is a little-known law," Iago told Father. Father disagreed, and Iago left,
sullen.

Iago was the characteristic ambitious operator from a conflict zone,
flirting with pro-India groups during the day, feeding, sheltering, donating
money to the separatist anti-India militant groups by night. One of
the commanders in the biggest militant group operating in the area,
_Hizbul Mujahideen_, was from Iago's village. While the militant was on
the run, Iago had supported his family. After his meeting with my father,
Iago sent word to the militant commander through one of his men:
"Peer is dangerous for you. He is working hard to ensure that village-level
elections go smoothly." Militant groups had called for a boycott of
all elections --- village, district, state --- which they saw as an exercise in
strengthening Indian rule in Kashmir.

Iago's men convinced them that if the militant boycott of the village
elections were to work well, they had to get my father out of the way. A
month later, the land mine went off. In the weeks following the attack,
hundreds of people visited our house, and the phone never stopped
ringing. Iago did not call. Much later, I bumped into him on the street.
He shook my hand, complained that I didn't visit his family, asked about
Father's well-being, and paid him many compliments. I kept up the pretense,
smiled back, and asked about his family.

Father was scared and even stopped making the twenty-minute journey
from his official house in Anantnag to our village. A few months
later, he left Anantnag for a new job in the relatively safe Srinagar.

I had somehow believed that my family would always be safe. I mentioned
this to my father. We had talked earlier about people dying but
never about death per se. "I, too, had this faith that we would be fine and
survive it all. Maybe people don't really believe that they can be killed
or come close to death," Father said.
