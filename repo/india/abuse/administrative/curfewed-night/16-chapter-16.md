## The Black Blanket

Two words had remained omnipresent in my journeys. Whether
it was at a feast or a funeral, a visit to a destroyed shrine or a
redeemed torture chamber, a story about a stranger or about
my own life, a poem or a painting, two words always made their presence
felt --- militants and soldiers. They had shadowed every life I wrote
about, including my own. Yet they remained ghostlike presences. My
friends in Delhi often asked me who they were, what they were like. I
asked myself the same question. I, too, had wanted to carry a gun, fight,
kill, and die. Some people I knew had crossed the line, carried a gun,
fought a battle, killed, and died. Some had survived.

I had recently visited the family of my cousin Tariq and met with
his younger brother, Shabnam. Twelve years after Tariq's death, I had
walked with Shabnam to the playground where we had last seen Tariq.
It was empty. The cheering crowds of August 1992 had melted away; the
militants were dead. Shabnam talked about his career, and there was a
girl. He wanted to marry her; their parents opposed the relationship.
Things had turned bitter after he dropped her off outside her college
on his bike. One of her relatives saw them and complained to their parents
about their waywardness. Now they met clandestinely at a friend's
place. He had spoken to his father about marrying her and wanted him
to take a proposal to her parents. His father had talked about family
honor, about marrying his children into respectable families, about the
girl's family being newly rich. Shabnam had asked friends and relatives
to convince his father, but the old man was rigid, unshakable.

Shabnam broke the unwritten rule with his father: He talked about
his dead brother. Families who had lost someone in the conflict rarely
talked about the dead. He confronted his father and said the most painful
words: "Tariq would not have turned to guns if you had allowed him
to marry the girl he liked." Now he regretted his words. His father had
wrapped himself in a brooding silence ever since. "What should I do?
I feel terrible for mentioning Tariq, and yet I cannot leave her. Should
I elope and marry in a civil court, or should I give up?" The wars of
nations and the wars of the heart mean pain, longing, and tears.

Before Tariq joined the militants, he was an ordinary student. I
remember him as being respectful to my father; whenever I visited their
house, he would be either working on his bicycle or playing cricket on
the nearby playground. I had heard about his hurried, nervous homecomings
but knew barely anything about his life as a militant. I couldn't
bring myself to talk to his brothers or his father about it. I thought of
various youngsters I had known during my adolescence who had joined
such groups. But I had to be careful. _The conflict is not over yet_, I reminded
myself.

Then I remembered Asif, a friend from school who had joined the
militants for a few years and returned to a civilian life. I had not seen
him since our school days in the early nineties. I leafed through my
album and found a photograph from our school days: I was fifteen and
standing with Asif in a garden in front of our boarding school. We lived
in the same hostel and played for the same volleyball team.

Asif was a dandy. I envied him the female attention and the accessories
such as Kamachi shoes. Kamachis were Russian sports shoes that the
militants made fashionable. To the teenagers of Kashmir's early nineties,
Che Guevara and Malcolm X were unheard of; militants walking
the ramp of war determined the fashion trends. Militants replaced the
stones in their rings with bullets, and boys replaced the stones in their
rings with bullets. A range of militaristic jewelry became fashionable.
The Sufi tradition of wearing an amulet was improvised upon: To the
string was added a Kalashnikov cartridge. Asif had his Kamachi shoes, his
bullet ring, and his cartridge amulet. He was cool.

I left Srinagar in early August for Anantnag, where I boarded a bus for
Asif's village farther south. I wasn't sure whether he would be there; I
didn't even have his phone number. The bus passed through scores of
Kashmiri villages and stopped an hour later at a military check post near
Asif's village. The frisking, the proof of identity, and the rude questions
that had seemed humiliating earlier were routine now, like brushing your
teeth. The soldiers let us pass; the bus moved on and stopped in the village
square. I walked through the bus yard to a grocery displaying a Coke billboard
with a life-size picture of Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai.

Two boys idling at the shop front volunteered to show me Asif's
house. We jostled along a labyrinth of lanes and reached the entrance of
a mansion with two wooden balconies. One of the boys rushed in and
returned with Asif's father, a lean, fifty-something, balding man wearing
a Nehru-style jacket popular with politicians.

"Is Asif around?" I asked.

"Who are you?" he asked, surveying me keenly.

I introduced myself. He warmed up and welcomed me into the house.
"I am sorry, I was not sure who it was," he said. "One has to be careful."
We sat in a carpeted drawing room. A picture of Mecca and a cheap print
of wild horses hung on a wall. Asif was visiting an uncle at the other end
of the village. There were no phones in the village. His father sent the
two boys to call him. "We got a phone booth for the whole village last
year," he said with a sigh, "but that does not work anymore."

"What happened?"

"The militants thought it could be used to inform the army about
their whereabouts, so they blasted the house where it was installed.
The house was damaged, and half the family was killed. Nobody even
thought about a phone after that." His village and the adjoining village
were known to have a strong military and militant presence; people
lived there obeying either the soldiers or the militants.

Asif's sister bought tea. She was at the university studying literature,
and Asif was getting a master's degree in history. I remembered his
father was a lawyer, and to keep up the conversation, I asked him about
his practice. "Well! I visit the court occasionally. My heart was never in
law. I make my money from my apple orchards." He paused and then
added wearily, "I always dreamed of politics. I wanted to contest elections,
be a politician. That remains my sole ambition."

"Have you joined any political party?"

"You think I want to die?" He laughed. He was in the ruling political
party, National Conference, until 1989. After the militancy began, he
published his resignation in local newspapers, like most other activists
of pro-India political parties. Militant groups were as intolerant of dissent
as the Indian state, and killed many activists. Public resignations
saved many lives. Asif's father gave up his political ambitions and stuck
to apple farming.

"Basharat," said an eager voice from the door. I turned around to find
a sturdy young man with short hair and big black eyes set in a chiseled
face. "Where have you been all these years?" Asif cried. We hugged. I
was always struck by the beauty of the friendships I had made during my
childhood. I would meet these boys after a decade and feel I had never
been away. His father left us alone to talk. Asif spoke slowly, carefully,
and seemed to forget his sentences halfway. He lived in the university
hostel in Srinagar, and visited his parents once a month. He attended
classes and read his textbooks. "There is not much to do after classes,"
he said. "I generally sit by the lake or stay in my room."

He drank his tea and looked at me as if debating whether to tell me
something. I was there to ask him about his militant life. But I couldn't
ask that question; it felt wrong to be even meeting an old friend because
I was keen to understand his militant experience.

After a while he began to talk about his life after school. He had
gone back to his village and joined a local college. Surrounded by barren
brown mountains, his village had become a militant stronghold. They
would parade in the open, slinging assault rifles from their shoulders,
hanging hand grenades from their belts. Indian troops stayed away most
of the time. There was no television, no telephones, not even a hospital
or proper municipal services. Militants stayed with the locals and ate at
their houses.

Asif got to know some militant commanders. He was impressed and
increasingly influenced by them. One day he left home and joined his
militant friends. At various hideouts, he learned to use an assault rifle,
throw a hand grenade, blast a land mine, and plan a guerrilla operation.
He roamed from one village to the other with his comrades-in-arms.
I tried hard to picture Asif in fatigues, carrying deadly weapons --- and
using them. He had been a militant for two years.

"What was it like?" I finally asked him.

"Scary," he replied. "My battalion treated me very well. We moved
around together and were generally quite happy being the way we were.
But it hurt me when we had to move from village to village, seeking
shelter and food. People welcomed us in their houses. But at times I felt
that people hosted and fed us because they were scared. I felt unwelcome,
almost like an armed beggar. I had grown up in luxury, and my
parents bought me everything I asked them for. And then I was a militant
sleeping in a house whose owner was scared that the army might
come there, who smiled at me and wished we would leave. I could not
sleep, and I missed my family."

Asif found it hard to talk about those days. I had an urge to ask
him if he had killed anyone. Instead, I asked him about his departure
from the militant group. "One day our commander told us that we had
to attack an army convoy," he told me. "I picked up my Kalashnikov.
We were about to leave, and I began shivering. I was too scared, and
death seemed so real. I left soon after that. My commanders were kind
enough to let me go."

We left his house, walked to the bus yard, and bought two Cokes
from the shop with the Aishwarya Rai poster. Asif loved Aishwarya and
watched all her films. I found her mechanical and told him so. That talk
lightened the atmosphere. We were boys again. Asif talked about graduating
from the local university and trying for a Ph.D. in Delhi or some
other Indian city. I voted for Delhi. "It is the best Indian city for a student.
You find good teachers and wonderful libraries. You must try Delhi
University and Jawaharlal Nehru University."

He agreed. "It must be fun being there."

"It can be great."

He had a mischievous smile on his face. "Tell me something?"

"What?" I was curious.

"Did you go to a discotheque in Delhi? Did you dance with the girls?"

I told him about my awkward attempts; we laughed.

We shook hands. I hopped onto a bus gliding out of the yard. Asif
turned onto the lane leading to his house. I watched him from the bus
window. I was happy for Asif, happy that he had survived and returned
home.

I reached Anantnag after sunset. The town was deserted, the shops
were closed, and groups of commuters huddled together in the bus yard.
I decided against heading for Srinagar and waited for a bus to my village.
After a few long minutes, a rickshaw stopped, and the driver yelled
the name of an area near my village. In half an hour, I was knocking at
the iron gate of my house. There was silence for the next few minutes.
Then my grandfather asked, "Who is it?" "It is Basharat, Baba!" The door
opened. I shook hands with Grandfather and two of my cousins standing
behind him like bodyguards.

After dinner I sat on a small balcony of the house overlooking the
road, beyond which paddy fields spread for miles to reach the arc of
mountains. A half-moon cast a faint white light on the village. In the
distance I heard the murmurs of the stream passing by. I sat on a chair,
plunked my feet on another, and stretched myself a bit. My thoughts
drifted to Asif and his militant days. He had talked about missing the
comforts of home as a militant. I understood. He couldn't have argued
with his fourteen-year-old cousin about changing the television channel
and resisted his grandmother's attempts to feed him food enough
for three people. Being a militant wasn't only about getting arms training
and fighting; it was also about being excluded from the simplest joys
of life.

Some of the militants became mythical figures, but they were dead.
And so were the men they had killed. People went home after the funerals
and the slogans and continued their lives till the next funeral and the
next round of slogans. I had witnessed that in the early nineties and saw
it again in the spring of 2004 on a visit to my old friend Hilal's house.

Hilal lived in a village south of Anantnag along the highway leading
from Srinagar to the Indian plains. We were in the same class at college,
had lived in the same dorm, and misspent our early youth together. We
had stayed in touch. He was a tall, lean youth with curly hair and restless
blue eyes. His usual dress was a T-shirt and jeans, and he almost always
walked hurriedly, carrying some novel or another in his hand. He had
worked as a journalist for some time after college but had given it up
after things turned a little nasty. Lately he had returned to study sociology
at the university in Srinagar. Now he looked like a slightly grown-up
version of himself from our college days, and he walked around with
a bag full of books. He was infamous for not returning the books he
borrowed.

The next morning I left to visit Hilal. At a bus stop in Anantnag, a
bunch of office workers waited along with me. For around half an hour,
there was no sign of a bus. We speculated about the reasons for the
delay and hoped it was not a general strike. Beside the highway, a row of
motels came to life, a regiment of soldiers patrolled, students walked to
a college nearby, and a policeman stood on a roundabout with no traffic
to redirect.

Then a truck screeched its brakes near the bus stop. Twenty or so
shabbily dressed men jumped out and stood near the roundabout. I
heard the battle cry _Allah-o-Akbar_ and turned around. The defiant posturing
against an unseen adversary seemed the beginning of a protest. The
men persisted in shouting. The workers at the motels, the shopkeepers,
the office goers, and the students eyed them in anticipation. The policeman
was nervous, and my comrades-in-waiting whispered: "Has someone
been arrested?"

A wiry youth carrying a bunch of sticks soaked them in petrol and lit
them with a match. He passed a burning stick to each of his fellow sloganeers.
They held the burning sticks like Olympic torches and moved in
a circle, chanting, "It is darkness everywhere." The policeman tried to
stop them; they continued. The soldiers returned, and the torchbearers
froze. The policeman talked to the soldiers, grabbed a baton, and joined
the determined soldiers in a baton charge. The protesters ran where
their feet took them. The burning sticks fell around the roundabout.
The policeman and the soldiers crushed the feeble fire with their heavy
leather boots. Bystanders watched; some smiled.

Later, I asked the policeman about the protesters. "They are from
some backward village and have no electricity," he told me. "So they
have come to disrupt traffic on the highway to force the government to
consider their demands."

I called Hilal; he told me the buses were off the roads because the
army had killed a militant commander in a nearby village. A strike had
been called to show solidarity. Hilal came to pick me up on his motorcycle.
We turned onto a dirt track meandering away from the highway
through fields. For miles there was no other vehicle on the road; the villages
seemed asleep. The dirt track entered Hilal's village, and we overtook
a row of trucks full of agitated men, women, and children. Hilal
told me the slain militant commander belonged to a village two miles
from his. The trucks were ferrying mourners to his funeral procession.
We parked the motorcycle and were watching the mourners when some
local boys walked up to Hilal and asked whether he wanted to go to the
funeral. "The trucks are going there. You can get on board."

We were unsure how safe this would be but decided to go for it, and
soon we were on the road. As we approached the village, we began to
see an unending stream of trucks and cars heading for the funeral. Men,
women, and children, old and young, were moving at a frenzied pace
toward the slain commander's home. We covered the four miles in half
an hour. We parked the motorcycle and followed a growing crowd. I
saw a wave of heads form the crests and troughs of hurrying humanity.
People stood on the mud walls bordering the lane, on the verandas of
houses, on the wooden rice barns, and on cowsheds. Some youngsters
watched the scene from tree branches. We heard pro-freedom slogans
in Urdu: _Hum Kya Chahte? Aazadi!_ (We want? Freedom!)

The commander's home was a bare house with maroon-painted brick
walls. His body was being taken to the graveyard. I jumped onto a mud
wall and saw a body covered with a green silk shawl lying on a cot: Arif
Khan, the South Kashmir commander for _Hizbul Mujahideen_. The cot
floated over heads; bodies jostled and hands stretched to carry it. The
wave moved like a flood, as if invigorated by the sight of the dead man. I
lost Hilal in the crowd. I looked at the faces around me. They were unlike
the hired protesters ferried in buses from villages by the political parties
to impress the television crews in Srinagar parks. Some cried, some held
back tears, and some burned with anger. Many brushed their hands over
the shroud and then rubbed their palms over their foreheads and chests.
It was a ritual Kashmiris followed at Sufi shrines, where people rubbed
their hands over the stairs leading to the saint's grave or the cloth covering
the saint's grave. The procession moved forward with more slogans:

>Arif, Tere Khoon Se Inquilab Aayega!
>
>(Arif, your blood will bring revolution!)
>
>Ae Zaalimo, Ae Jaabiro, Kashmir Hamara Chorr Do!
>
>(Oh tyrants! Oh tormentors! Quit our Kashmir!)
>
>Arif Se Poocho! Arif Kahta hai! Aazadi!
>
>(Ask Arif? And he will tell you: Freedom!)

The pallbearers passed by where I stood on the mud wall. I peered
hard to catch a glimpse of the slain militant. Khan had been in his early
thirties, a short, lean man whose baldness gave an elongated look to his
face. I saw his lifeless, half-open black eyes and an unwashed mark of
clotted blood on his forehead. I saw the gray shirt he was wearing when
he died. The procession moved on. A young man climbed onto the wall
holding a black leather shoe and shouted, "Whose shoe is it?" A boy
who had lost his shoes turned around to look and said it was not his.

I joined the funeral procession. A little ahead, I heard singing. It
sounded like a chorus of female voices singing traditional marriage
songs, and it was rising above the fervor of the men's slogans. The tune
reminded me of a song girls sang in my village on the eve of Eid. A group
of around fifty girls and women followed the procession. I waited for the
women and walked behind them. Some adjusted their head scarves, and
others let the scarves slip as they swept through the street and sang: "_Shaheedo
Mubarak! Shaheedo Mubarak_!" (Congratulations! Oh Martyr! You have
earned the martyrdom.)

Outside the graveyard, comrades of the slain commander were
affirming the longevity of their organization after his death. A group
of militants in their early twenties raised their Kalashnikovs and black
Chinese pistols in the air and saluted the dead man with intermittent
volleys piercing the azure sky. A mustached man with a pistol shouted a
Kashmiri militant version of "The king is dead; long live the king": "_Zinda
Hai HM_" (_Hizbul Mujahideen_ lives). Militants and the mourners shouted
back in chorus, "_Zinda Hai_" (He lives).

A group of men circled the grave dug out for Khan. Fresh, moist soil
piled around the pit. Pallbearers laid the cot near the grave. More people
had arrived; they wanted to see Khan's face before he was buried.
Mourners argued, and the burial was delayed. The wooden graveyard
gate creaked against the mass of people trying to push it open. Men and
women were pulling and pushing the fence.

I barely managed to jump over the fence and was pushing my way out
when a tiny, middle-aged woman caught me by the collar and shouted,
"Listen to me." Her face, shining with sweat, almost matched the shade
of her bright pink _pheran_. "He was born here, but he grew up, he fought,
and he died in my village. I have walked ten miles with a hundred people
to get here. Tell them they cannot bury him till we see his face." I told
her the burial was delayed. She hugged me and charged at the graveyard
fence, which was giving way.

I pushed my way out of the procession. I took off my jacket, washed
my face, and drank from a roadside tap. I rested for a while at a shop
front. It seemed like a day borrowed from the early nineties, when such
funerals were held almost everywhere, almost every day.

An old man standing by the shop front scanned me; I could see his
eyes registering my denim jacket, my corduroy trousers, my satchel, and
my notebook. "You are not from these parts?" he asked. I gave him the
name of my village. He could see I was not a mourner. "What brought
you here?" I said, "I am a journalist." The old man blurted the word with
disdain and shouted, "Where are the TV people? Go back and tell them
what happened here! Tell them this is what they should show live."

Hilal waited beyond the mile-long row of vehicles. He seemed
exhausted by the experience; I was. We left for his village. Reclining
on cushions in his room, boosted by a good cup of coffee, we slowly
recovered from the dizzying fervor of the funeral. Hilal saw the world
like a student of sociology. He talked about the class composition of the
funeral gathering: lower-middle classes and peasantry. Fascinated by the
role that myths and legends played in a society like Kashmir, he narrated
the myths he'd heard about Arif Khan at the funeral. "Some people said
he would change costumes and escape detection by the army. One day
he was a shepherd herding cattle on the highway; another day he was a
Gujar nomad, dressed in a waistcoat and turban, riding a horse past an
army patrol in a village."

The nature of the separatist militancy in Kashmir had changed. The
pro-independence JKLF had been dominated by the pro-Pakistan _Hizbul
Mujahideen_ by 1994; by the mid-nineties, the Pakistani pan-Islamist militants
from _Lashkar-e-Taiba_ and, later, _Jaish-e-Mohammed_ had become
a significant presence. The Pakistani Islamist militants mostly kept to
themselves and did not mingle with the population, like the Kashmiri
militants. _Lashkar_ and _Jaish_ believed in suicide bombings, which the
Kashmiri militants --- including the Islamist _Hizbul Mujahideen_ --- had
avoided. I had never met or interviewed a _Lashkar_ or _Jaish_ man except
on television or in newspaper pictures, which showed the dead men
being dragged by Indian soldiers after a suicide attack on a military
camp. Much of the reportage described them as either the poor or the
orphans of the Afghan war, raised in rnadrasas and then pushed into
Kashmir by their handlers in the Pakistani army and intelligence.

I had a sense of Kashmiri militants; I knew their context, could place
them somewhere on a social map. A lot of them had been killed, like my
cousin Tariq and my friend Pervez; a lot of them put down their arms
and returned to quiet civilian lives, like my school friend Asif; and a lot
of them had played all sides, trying to make what they could out of the
chaos and the confusion of the conflict, like Yusuf did.

I knew Yusuf from my childhood. He had many lives since then. In
1987 Yusuf was a constable in the local police. In his free time, he hovered
around _Heavan_, the only theater in Anantnag, getting a bunch of
tickets and selling them for a quick profit to the hordes thronging for
matinee shows. In 1991 Yusuf returned to Kashmir after four months in
a militant training camp in Pakistan. I saw him on the road outside my
house. He wore an expensive leather jacket over blue jeans and a white
shirt, with a shining silver pistol jutting out of his trousers. "Is masterji
home?" he said, asking about my grandfather, who had at some point
taught him, like thousands of others. Yusuf sat on a sofa in our drawing
room and, putting on an air of gravity, told Grandfather, "Masterji, you
are like a father to me. If anyone gives you any trouble, tell him you are
Azad Khan's \[Yusuf's new name\] teacher." He put the pistol on the table
and had some tea and biscuits. Grandfather made some small talk and
then reluctantly asked, "You were in the police and already knew how to
use guns. Then why did you go to Pakistan?"

Yusuf laughed. "Just to see Pakistan! And then it is like a certificate, a
degree, that you are a real militant! Otherwise people wouldn't take me
seriously."

In 1995 I saw Yusuf again, in Anantnag, outside a counter-insurgent
camp. He said that being a separatist militant was too dangerous. Death
seemed close, so he had changed sides, living under the protection and
patronage of the Indian army.

In 1996, after six years of direct rule from Delhi, India decided to
hold local elections in Kashmir. The election was a joke. Almost nobody
voted. The counter-insurgents contested; the few people who were
dragged by the soldiers to polling booths voted against them. Yusuf had
sensed the mood and left the counter-insurgents. Militants had issued
threats against electoral candidates. The Indian government promised
them official housing, bulletproof cars, and armed police constables
and paramilitary soldiers as bodyguards. Yusuf seized the moment and
joined a small-time political party that never won a seat. I was home
for the holidays from college. My father was posted in Anantnag as the
additional deputy commissioner, the second most senior administrator
of the district. Father stayed in his official residence, a housing complex
where only senior government officers and politicians lived. I saw Yusuf
leaning against a bulletproof jeep a few houses from my father's residence.
He seemed healthier and more prosperous.

In 2003, whatever happened in Kashmir, people like Yusuf --- and there
were a lot of them --- found ways of "doing well." I had flown from Delhi
to report on a massacre of Kashmiri Hindus in the village of Nadimarg.
The place was reeling with pain; the wails of survivors and the traces of
the massacre brought tears to every eye. All major Indian politicians,
including then deputy prime minister L. K. Advani and the Congress
party president, Sonia Gandhi, and her charismatic daughter, Priyanka,
were there. Sonia Gandhi was talking to a few survivors. Priyanka stood
beside her, stately and composed in a sari. Commandos guarding them
formed a circle around the mother and daughter. A tall man in a politician's
regulation white _kurta_ pajamas and Nehru jacket walked up to
Priyanka Gandhi. It was Yusuf. They spoke for a bit, the princess speaking
slowly; the sycophant, at his obsequious best, listening. Then Yusuf
turned around; his face was glowing with that brief moment of intimacy
with the most powerful daughter in Asia, a woman whose word could
take him far in politics.

In June 2004 I was walking in Srinagar city center. A fancy car stopped
next to me, and Yusuf called out my name. He stepped out of the car and
hugged me. "I hear you have become a big journalist. But you shall not
forget me! Write something about me, too." One day, I promised. I had
to rush somewhere and couldn't take him up on his offer for coffee.

In September 2004 I was home reading a local newspaper. The headline
read:

>MILITANTS' BROAD DAYLIGHT STRIKE IN ANANTNAG
>
>CONG LEADER, PSO GUNNED DOWN

On the morning of September 29, 2004, Yusuf, now the vice president
for the Congress Party in Anantnag, had stopped his SUV in an
Anantnag market. He asked his bodyguard to stay in the car and walked
toward a shop. A few militants came out of an alley and fired at him.
Yusuf and his bodyguard were rushed to a hospital. The doctors couldn't
help; they were dead.

Even Yusuf did not get out alive. I had come to believe he could play
his cards, that he would survive, that we would meet again.

The Pakistani militants operating in Kashmir were very different from
the Kashmiri separatist guerrillas who started the anti-India rebellion in
1990. I was curious about them and wanted to meet some. Friends suggested visiting Shopian, a small town in South Kashmir.

Bill Clinton called Kashmir the most dangerous place on earth.
Those who lived in Kashmir called Shopian the most dangerous place in
Kashmir. The town had a heavy presence of Indian troops and Pakistani
and Kashmiri militants fighting them. Some years back, at my university
in Delhi, I had met Ahmed, an engineering student from Shopian.
We became friends and spent many nights in my hostel room, smoking,
drinking coffee, and talking about literature --- Orwell and Steinbeck and
Ayn Rand, Ahmed's goddess.

He seemed to fancy himself Howard Roark, Rand's protagonist from
_The Fountainhead_. He repeated Rand's theme throughout the night. "Ego!
Basharat, Ego is the fountainhead of man's progress. A man should be
like Howard Roark, committed to excellence and undeterred by circumstances."
His deep brown eyes shone, and his voice quivered with
excitement every time he repeated the lines. His hands rose and fell like
hammers hitting imaginary nails as he spoke.

I did not have his address now; it seemed unlikely that I would find
such an ambitious guy in the drowsy but dangerous town. I called a
mutual friend in Srinagar who gave me his home number. He was not
sure whether Ahmed was there. A woman received the call and told me
he worked in a bank in town.

The road to Shopian ran like a black streak through cone-roofed
brick-and-wood houses. The usual Kashmiri landscape of fields, willows
and poplars, orchards and military camps separated the villages.
Beyond them were mountains, bald and forested. The driver of the taxi
I was sharing with five other people from Srinagar was a grim-looking
man who drove at a self-destructive speed. A folksinger whined on
the car stereo: "Oh magician! Which arrow have you pierced my heart
with?"

Two hours after leaving Srinagar, our jeep stopped in the dusty market
in Shopian. The market --- two opposing rows of garment shops, grocers,
booksellers, chemists, and tea stalls --- was the typical Kashmiri
small-town market. Jeeps and buses waited for passengers; villagers carrying
grocery and apple pesticides for their orchards hung around. Soldiers
with rifles slung over their shoulders patrolled the road. Drinking
tea in a kiosk at the taxi stand, I remembered a winter holiday spent here
with my parents in the mid-eighties, when my father worked here. I
thought of his copies of _Reader's Digest_, which I read eagerly; a blue lawn
tennis ball with which my brother and I used to play cricket; and the legend
narrated by my father and his friends: the romance of Prince Nagirai
and Princess Heemal, believed to have lived here in ancient times. Two
springs on the outskirts of the town were named after them. Nostalgia
drew me to look for them.

The driver was still waiting for passengers. I asked him about the
springs of Heemal and Nagirai. His grim face lit up. "I have spent many
hours by those springs. I will take you there." We headed back on the
road out of town. He stopped the car the moment we had left the clutter
of the town and entered a grove of willows. He walked off the road and
pointed to a chinar tree. "That is the spring of Nagirai." Under a young
chinar was a tiny loop-shaped spring covered by crimson leaves. A heap
of apple branches lay beside it.

The basin of a vast river, now dried to a trickle, spread beyond the
poplars behind the chinar. Beyond the dried-up river rose a hill. "The
spring of Heemal lies near that hill," Hasan, the driver, said. We drove
farther on the road leading out of the town. "Nagirai's spring is sacred.
We still see snakes come and go from it. Last year three soldiers killed a
snake at Nagirai's spring. Three days later, those soldiers were killed in a
mine blast." The ancient Hindu reverence toward the snake gods seemed
to live on despite the conversion of most Kashmiris to Islam.

A few miles ahead, the road turned into a dirt path going up the
hill. The hilltop housed a huge army camp. Hasan stopped the car half a
mile before the camp and said, "The passengers are supposed to walk."
I walked to the gates, where the soldiers frisked me and checked my
identity card.

"What business do you have here?" a soldier shouted.

"I want to visit the spring beyond your camp."

"Spring?" His tone was both sarcastic and skeptical.

I guessed he was from Punjab, famous for a similar legend. "The
spring here belongs to the memory of the Heer of Kashmir. Her story is
to Kashmir what Heer-Ranjha is to Punjab," I replied.

He drew his head back, weighed my words, and smiled. "I have been
here for a long time, but I never knew this. Go ahead! Visit your Heer!"

Beyond the last gate of the camp, Hasan had parked the car by a willow
grove. He pointed to another chinar tree down the slope. "That is
the spring of Heemal."

A rectangular concrete wall shaped the spring. A boy bent over the
wall and stirred the moss-covered water with a twig. He looked up and
stopped. I asked him about the spring. "It is Heemal's spring. The world
knows it; she was the princess of Kashmir in ancient times and loved
Nagirai, who was the prince," he said, trying to be authoritative. Then he
paused and asked, "Isn't that why you have come here?"

"Yes."

He smiled and stirred the moss-covered water with the twig. The legend
lived.

***

On the way back I walked to Ahmed's bank. A blue-and-white sign
announced the presence of the bank in the ground floor of a newly built
featureless square brick house on a lane bridging out of the market.
Howard Roark would not have approved of the architecture. A wooden
counter with cheap brown Formica sheets nailed to it stretched like a
border between the customers and the employees. Behind the counter,
five men sat on wooden chairs, heads bent over thick registers or
voucher slips. A short bearded man and a tall veiled woman argued with
a clerk. The clerk, a tall man with deep brown eyes and high cheekbones,
was waving his hands in the air. I watched him for a long moment.

"Basharat!" Ahmed jumped from his chair. "How the hell did you get
here? I cannot believe this!"

He took leave of his office, and we almost ran out onto the street,
laughing, backslapping. We headed for his home at the other end of the
town. It was a neat brick-and-stone house overlooking a lawn beyond
which spread an apple orchard. We sat in Ahmed's room, smoked cigarettes
over cups of tea, and exchanged stories. He had returned home
two years back for a vacation and found his parents leading a life of loneliness
and fear. An only child, he decided to stay. There was no job in the
town for a man of his qualifications, but a clerk's job in the local branch
of a bank came up six months later. For months he struggled with himself,
hoping to return to Delhi and his dreams. They faded. Ahmed fell
in love with a local girl who studied literature at the local college. "She
is like me. She, too, loved Ayn Rand and dreamed of individual achievement.
She too has taken up a job in a local school because of her family."

Ahmed opened a window. Its frame seemed to organize the view of
the garden, the apple orchard, and the hump of a hill rising in the distance.
We saw his wiry, aging mother and stooping father sitting on the
lawn. He looked at them engrossed in their conversation. "This is my
truth. Howard Roark was an illusion." His words came slowly, and he
closed the window again. We did not talk about the conflict. We were
trying to relive the old days. We talked about books and writers. I was
carrying a copy of _Homage to Catalonia_ and gave it to him. "You will find
Kashmir in its pages," I said.

The sound of brisk footsteps made us look out of the window. We
saw a group of young men with guns walking down the alley beside
the house. Ahmed told me they were Pakistani militants. "They must
be going to some hideout," he said. I asked if he had met one. He told
me that three of them had knocked on the door one night. He and his
parents had to serve them dinner after one of the militants pushed his
father in his chest with a gun. Ahmed hadn't gone beyond nervous small
talk, and after dinner the militants had left. "They were in their early
twenties and carried their guns, sleek satellite phones, and laptops."

I was about to ask Ahmed about the possibility of meeting one
of these men when he told me a story that was making the rounds of
Shopian. Pirated DVDs of a Bollywood movie starring actor Salman Khan
had reached the local video shop. Khan played a roguish small-town college
student, and the story of his self-destructive love, titled _Tere Naam_
(In Your Name), was one of the biggest hits of the year. Its soundtrack
was all the rage. Every other youngster was getting his hair done like
Khan; the hairdo became famous as the _Tere Naam_ style. In Shopian, a
nineteen-year-old Pakistani member of _Jaish-e-Mohammed_ bought a
copy of the video. A few days later, he ordered a local barber to shave his
beard and cut his hair in the _Tere Naam_ style. Over the next few weeks,
the new-look militant was seen outside the local women's college staring
wistfully at a girl he had fallen for. Ahmed told me, "He wants to
marry her and take her back to Pakistan. But her parents are against it. I
saw him a few times in the local market; he looks completely lovestruck,
and now the entire town calls him _Tere Naam_,"

Outside, the day was dying; the lawn, the orchards, and the hill were
turning into dark outlines of their former selves. As if suddenly remembering
something, Ahmed looked at the intruding darkness and got up.
He lit a candle, closed the window, and drew the curtains. He pulled
two black blankets from a cupboard, threw them over the curtains, and
switched on the light. "Why the blankets?" I asked. "To make it look
like a dark room from outside; we do that in every room after dusk," he
said. "We have no streetlights and switch on no lights at the entrance or
in the courtyard." Bright lights would provoke the soldiers to barge in
and check the house for militants, and attract the militants to choose
the house as shelter for the night. Hundreds of homes were destroyed
in those encounters between soldiers and militants; hundreds of people
were arrested, tortured, and jailed by the soldiers for housing militants.
People hoped not to hear a knock at the door in the evening. The
drone of a passing vehicle or the sound of footsteps outside a home was
enough to make a family shiver. How many deep breaths did we breathe
after sounds died into the night and nobody knocked?

I had experienced that fear only a few days before I traveled to
Ahmed's town. One evening Salaam, our cook, came rushing into the
room. He was a thin, balding guy obsessed with the radio. My father was
busy with his files in the next room. Salaam was sweating and breathing
heavily. He motioned for me to be silent. "Somebody has come into
the drawing room." A door opened from our kitchen into the drawing
room. Salaam tried opening that door and felt that someone was pushing
it back. In the past, if you were superstitious, you blamed it on ghosts,
while rational people looked for rational explanations. Today the first
thought that came to mind was of unidentified gunmen.

Salaam believed that the person who had entered our drawing room
could mean harm. We decided not to disturb my father and to deal with
it on our own. We tiptoed into the kitchen. Salaam locked the door
leading to the stairs from the ground floor to the first floor. We stood
staring at the door that hid the intruder. We pressed our ears to the
wood to listen for any signs of movement. We heard silence and stray
dogs barking on the road. We moved away from the door and decided
in whispers to find a weapon and go into the room. The weapon was
a problem, but we managed to find a kitchen knife. Being bigger and
older, I grabbed it; Salaain stood behind me, holding a kitchen fork
like a dagger. I tried to hide my shivering hand from Salaam, who was
trying equally hard to look brave. We were scared but ready to put up
a fight.

The moment to charge at an unseen enemy came. We kicked open
the door and rushed into the room. A kitchen knife and a fork rose at
a murderous angle. We looked around the room. The sofa was empty,
the chairs were empty, only the bookshelf was there. The intruder was
nowhere. A corner of the carpet had upturned near the door. It had gotten
stuck in the door and wedged it. We saw it at the same moment and
looked at each other. We threw our weapons on the floor and laughed.

The prospects were not humorous in Ahmed's town, which, like
many other places in Kashmir, lived with intense fear. I imagined his
aging parents huddled alone in their kitchen all those years when Ahmed
was away, and I understood why he had stayed. In that moment I came
to respect him more than ever; he had done better than Howard Roark.
I turned toward him with a respectful gaze as he silently puffed on his
cigarette and stared at the designs of the carpet where we sat. Lighting
another cigarette, he looked at me with the expression of an aged, tired
man. "It is killing me," Ahmed said.

The fighting had destroyed whatever work culture there was in Kashmir.
In his town, there were no libraries and no bookshops. People
wanted to be safe and nothing more. Ahmed spoke of the fear of seeing
his house in rubble after an encounter. Even if no militants or soldiers
barged in, he expected it. Ahmed's family, friends, and townsfolk talked
of nothing other than the conflict. "My parents worked all their life to
save enough to build this house. An hour-long battle can turn it to charcoal
and rubble." I asked, "Why don't you leave? You can go to any big
city and make a career. Why don't you return to Delhi?" I had no other
words. He wanted to leave but could not leave his parents. And even if he
left to seek a better career elsewhere, many Ahmeds would have to stay.

It was close to midnight. Ahmed removed the blankets and the curtains
from the windows. "It is safe now. There is no movement at this
time." The town was wrapped in darkness; the dark blue sky and the
silver stars were quiet.

I couldn't bring myself to ask Ahmed to risk himself by introducing
me to some Pakistani militants, but the visit to Shopian had heightened
my awareness of life in a heavily militarized society. On my way
back to Srinagar, I passed Indian military and paramilitary vehicles and
camps every few minutes. India has more than half a million soldiers
in Kashmir. Srinagar is a city of bunkers, and the armored cars and soldiers
patrolling roads or manning check posts had become a part of the
Kashmiri landscape, like the willows, poplars, and pines. I knew soldiers
were mostly the rural and urban poor of India, who stood outside the
military and paramilitary recruitment centers in long lines with great
hopes of getting the dangerous and absurdly low-paying job. I remembered
seeing reports of a growing shortage of officers in the army as the
Indian economy got better, but I never saw any reports of a shortage of
soldiers. The poor were numerous. But beyond the olive or khaki uniforms,
stiff faces, curt commands, and threatening guns, I knew nothing
about them as people. The only words we had spoken to each other
were the litanies of an identity check. Since I was a Kashmiri, it was also
unwise to attempt prolonged conversation with a soldier.

Now, with Indian Independence Day on August 15, a few days ahead,
the soldiers expected more militant attacks and were more aggressive,
and frisking and identity checks had increased. I stayed home in Srinagar
and thought about the soldiers I had come across. I thought of the two
who had interrogated me in the crackdown on our village.

I remembered another soldier I had a chance meeting with in June. I
remembered his face, his name, and his words. In May 2004 India had its
parliamentary elections; the results were declared in June. The Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) was thrown out of power, and the Congress Party came
to power, supported by a Communist coalition. The newspapers and
television channels screamed the results in shrill voices, and big headlines
and hundreds of editorials and opinion pieces analyzing the unexpected
change in regime followed.

I was at Lal Chowk to meet a journalist friend, Amir. He was relaxed;
the election results would fill the pages of his Delhi-based newspaper
for the rest of the week. There would be no space for the news from
Kashmir, and he was taking it easy. We had a coffee and talked about
whatever we were reading. He had a book I wanted to read, and we left
to fetch it. In his office, heaps of newspapers were stacked on dusty
tables, and cigarette butts filled an ashtray. Smoke hung in the air. Some
journalist friends dropped in and the conversation shifted to news. "It is
peaceful today; no news yet," one reporter said.

Suddenly, the door was thrown open. "May I come in?" We turned
toward the entrance. A soldier in a bulletproof jacket, slinging an AK-47
over his shoulder, marched in as Amir said, "Yes." A leaner, meeker subordinate
followed. "I came to check on you," the first soldier told Amir.
He had stopped Amir in the morning on the way to the office. Amir had
shown him his identity card. The soldier had talked about the need to
check suspicious-looking people and had asked Amir about a nick on his
face that came from a shaving razor. Amir had felt insulted and asked the
soldier to speak to his officers, who knew him as a journalist with a leading
Indian newspaper. The soldier had let him off.

Seeing the soldier walk into his office irritated Amir. "Didn't you see
my identity card in the morning?"

"I did. But we still have to check anyone who is suspicious-looking. I
am here to confirm whether your identity card was a real one."

"You should know how to spot a suspicious-looking person." Amir
raised his voice. "You should know the difference between a grocery
and a newspaper office."

It seemed to have no effect on the soldier. He walked around haughtily
and, turning to Amir, said, "You should know I can enter any place
anytime. It is my job." Amir pulled out his telephone directory, called a
senior officer from the soldier's force, and explained the situation. The
officer spoke to the soldier on the phone. He kept muttering, "Nothing,
sir," and then walked off. Amir told me the senior officer had apologized
for the soldier's conduct and had promised to send an officer to look
into the matter. Two more reporters from other news organizations
dropped in. The seniormost reporter advised Amir not to take words
like "esteem" and "dignity" seriously.

Coffee and conversation followed for the next half hour, and then
there was another knock on the door. An officer in combat dress walked
in, followed by around ten soldiers. The officer asked the soldiers to
leave; they stood at the gate. The officer walked briskly to the corner of
the room, where we sat. He was a tall, muscular man with small brown
eyes shining beneath the visor of his cap. Pointing a finger at each of us,
he asked in a single breath, "What is your name? What do you do? Journalist?
Which newspaper?" We gave our introductions; he gave none.
Someone offered him a chair. He sat and told us that he was there to
look into the matter. He seemed angry. "You guys can see my rank and
read my name on my uniform. I am an officer and not a civilian who
needs an introduction. And still, when I walked in here, you did not
show me the respect an officer deserves. Nobody stood up from his
chair. Nobody spoke with respect." We looked at one another. He stared
at us. An awkward silence fell. One of Amir's colleagues tried to pacify
him by offering tea and cigarettes. He refused, saying he did not drink
tea and did not smoke.

A series of explanations began. "We did not mean disrespect." "We
have great professional relations with your force and regard it highly."
"We did not have time to treat you with due respect, as you abruptly
asked for our introductions." Five journalists representing reputed
Delhi-based organizations were almost obsequiously trying to explain
themselves. I remained silent. The explanations and mild arguments
went on for half an hour. The officer mentioned that he belonged to
a counter-insurgent unit, which we knew specialized in encounters. It
seemed a veiled threat. The officer sank into the chair, spread his legs,
and tossed his cap on the table. His surname helped me place him as
being from Haryana. I asked if that was true. "How could you guess
that?" he asked. "I lived in Delhi and had many friends from your caste,"
I answered.

The grip of the ancient Hindu caste system on northern India was
evident in his first smile. He showed signs of relaxation and turned
toward me. I talked about my friends from my Delhi University days.
He had been at Delhi University, too. "I was in the law faculty, where
were you?" I asked. He had been in a college next to mine. I talked about
the university, about the college festivals, the hangouts, the rivalries,
the girls' hostel nearby, and almost everything that one misses about
university life. He seemed to have transformed into a Delhi University
alumnus and forgotten he was an Indian paramilitary officer posted in
Kashmir. His language changed as he spoke about the Jawahar bookstore,
where we bought cheap photocopies of texts and reference books;
of Kamala Nagar market, where students hung out after class; of Majnu
Ka Tila, where Tibetan refugees sold cheap knockoff clothing and beer.
"Give me a fag, man! And get me some tea," he said, smiling. We had tea
and smoked. He apologized; the roomful of journalists apologized back.
Peace was made. As he began to leave, he said, "I was a different man
before I joined the force and came to Kashmir."

I thought about his instant switch upon being reminded of his civilian
life. He didn't seem very different from my former militant friend
Asif, who wanted to know about discotheques and girls in Delhi. Yet
young men like them, on different sides of the military divide, had
killed and died after they chose to become militants and soldiers. Those
who had survived seemed to have cremated and buried the individuals
they had once been.

I hoped that someday they could cease being part of processes that
reduced individuals to suspects or military targets, shorn of all human
complexity --- processes that left them with bare nomenclatures such
as militants, soldiers, paramilitaries. I hoped that someday they could
return to their homes where they could sit on balconies or argue with
their cousins about changing the television channel. I hoped that someday
the war they were fighting and the reasons for its existence would
disappear like footsteps on winter snow.
