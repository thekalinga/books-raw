## City of No Joy

In old pictures, Srinagar is elegant latticed houses, mosques, and
temples admiring each other from the banks of the River Jhelum;
it is people strolling on the seven wooden bridges and wandering
into old bazaars selling spices, lovingly embroidered shawls and carpets,
and samovars with intricate engravings, or stepping with a prayer and an
expectation into a medieval shrine, flaunting verses of the Quran and
poems of mystics on windows and facades, and the gentle greens and
blues of papier-mâché interiors. But elegance is granted little space in
age of wars. Those wooden bridges have either collapsed or been torn
down. Their skeletons remain in the shadow of new arcs of concrete.

My parents live near the left bank of the Jhelum, a short walk from
the eighth bridge, built later and named the Zero Bridge. Lal Chowk, the
city center, is right across the river. I walked past the three neighborhood
bunkers, an ATM machine, a mosque, grocers, chemists, and stationery
shops before reaching the riverbank. Half-dried clothing hung
from nylon ropes tied to the masts of white and caramel houseboats
waiting for visitors. A few eagles flew over majestic chinar trees on the
other bank, circled over the Zero Bridge, and seemed to rise even higher
than the mountains drawing a border in the city's east. An old boatman
sat in a _shikara_, holding a rough willow branch he used as an oar, waiting
for passengers. He urged me to sit toward his end of the boat and leave
room for others. I walked with a sense of dread over the decaying planks
of timber through which water was seeping in. The boatman switched
on his radio and pushed the boat into the river with a thrust of the willow
branch against the bank. The passengers clutched the sides of the
boat. A song floated over the tense silence.

A few minutes later, we reached the other bank, paid one rupee each,
and after showing our identity cards to a group of soldiers patrolling the
riverbank, walked over to the city center. Lal Chowk is a busy avenue of
sixties-style buildings. Hawkers selling cheap knockoffs of name-brand
shoes and electronic gadgets spilled over the footpaths, and carpet
shops hung rugs and shawls and made competing claims of being great
works of Kashmiri craftsmanship. Small mobs pounced on newsstands
to buy newspapers, and bawdy Bollywood lyrics blared from various
shops selling pirated videos and CDs. Indian soldiers patrolled the road
and looked around like weathercocks. I was struck by a name painted on
an armored military truck parked by the roadside. I had seen such names
but never paid much attention. The Hindi letters, which few Kashmiris
can read, said: _MAHAKAAL_ --- literally, great death, and one of the names of
Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction.

I walked past Mahakaal to one of the more reliable Internet cafés
housed in an old commercial complex. Near the entrance, a crowd of
young and old men hovered around a mobile tea shop. Cement flaked
off the walls of the building, and dark stairs led to the café. I entered a
brightly lit room. Wooden cubicles hugged the garish walls. The young
manager and a girl wearing a thick coat of lipstick sat behind a wooden
counter. "Sexy Lady" played from an invisible speaker. The cabins had
two chairs each, and planks of teakwood revealed only feet: sneakers,
sandals; sneakers, sandals; sneakers, sandals. Young couples bought
an hour of privacy for thirty rupees. I had barely managed to send a
single e-mail when the connection snapped after half an hour. Nobody
complained. I thought of my first visit to the café in 2001, soon after it
opened. For security reasons, the government had ordered every user to
show an identity card and provide his address before using the Internet.
At least that had been done away with now.

Outside, the number of cars on the roads had increased. One could
barely drive through Lal Chowk without being caught in a traffic jam.
Everyone talked about the abundance of easy personal loans and the
huge amounts of money both India and Pakistan had pumped into Kashmir
to win loyalties --- the war economy. The only institution that had
thrived in Kashmir throughout the conflict was a bank. Walking around
in Srinagar, I would find myself facing a billboard announcing yet another
licensee for a stockbroker in Bombay or Delhi. A lot of money was being
invested in shares and stocks. On my return, I met Ayaar, an old friend
from college. A mechanical engineer by training and a fanatical detective
fiction fan, he had turned to stock brokerage after three years of
unemployment. We walked to his office in one of the many newly built
ugly malls in Srinagar. A billboard announced the office. We walked into
a damp half-lit room with bare walls; he checked three flickering monitors.
After the customary round of tea, he tried to persuade me to invest
in stocks.

After a few minutes, two young men walked in. "We want to invest in
shares," one said, "but have no idea how it works." My friend metamorphosed
into a stockbroker. He pulled up two chairs, sent his office boy
to fetch tea for the guests, grabbed a few brochures, and earnestly began
to explain the business to the clueless youth. Fifteen minutes later,
he was back at the flickering monitor with another round of explanations.
He pointed out the stocks rising and falling, identified blue-chip
stocks, and told stories about the man who had made a hundred thousand
rupees in five hours. "You keep your eyes open, look for the clues,
and this is where you will make money." Like a passionate evangelist,
Ayaar continued preaching to strengthen the faith of his converts. The
share bazaar seemed like detective fiction: The right clues led to the gold
mine. Stocks and shares were words from a language foreign to me: the
language of Wall Street, of Bombay, of corporate India. It was here along
with the armored cars, funerals, shutdowns/strikes, fear, and despair.
Srinagar built memorials for its disappeared young alongside shopping
malls with gaudy glass facades.

I slowly settled down in my parents' house, arranging my books and
placing my desk and computer by a window with a view of chinar and
mulberry trees. Parrots, sparrows, and eagles flew in and out of the trees
into a clear blue sky. It was autumn: the season of golden chinar leaves
falling on dried grass, on footpaths, on people passing by. I was happy to
be here and spend my afternoons talking to friends in coffee shops near
Lal Chowk.

Srinagar is also a greeting, an encounter with a confidant on every
street. It is not providing contexts and chronologies to my stories and
not explaining the details and the meanings. It is conveying more in a
single spoken phrase than in paragraphs and pages in my adopted languages.
It is talking endlessly about our shared past, not so much the
remote historical past but the recent past --- of the fairy-tale childhood of
the eighties and the horror of the nineties.

As a schoolboy in the mid-1980s, I had visited Pari Mahal --- the Palace
of the Fairies --- built in the seventeenth century by the liberal Mughal
prince Dara Shikhoh. Dara Shikhoh preferred scholarship to statecraft,
inviting many learned men to his palace to translate texts of Hindu philosophy,
religion, and literature into Persian and Arabic. My father told
me these stories over and over because he wanted me to see Pari Mahal
as a place of multiple religious traditions. But as a child, I was keener to
pose with my classmates for group pictures, play hide-and-seek on the
ramparts, or watch the palace --- strung, appropriately, with fairy lights
--- shimmer at night.

One September evening, after showing a visitor's permit and a security
check, I returned to Pari Mahal, cresting one of the peaks of the
Zabarvan Mountains in eastern Srinagar. Its massive walls of rough stone
decorated with arches led to domed chambers, a pattern repeated on
its gardened terraces. Below it, the luxurious greens of a forest and an
expansive golf course --- where politicians, bureaucrats, police, and military
officers guarded by scores of armed guards played and socialized on
imported American grass --- reached out to Dal Lake, the achingly beautiful
chameleon changing its shades as light played tricks on its unruffled
water. Tourists took photos of the sun rolling toward the quiet, graceful
mountains. Near the entrance, two chambers enclosed by granite arches
had been converted into barracks and a mess hall. A soldier was busy
cooking over a wood fire, and a few others played carom. Behind them
in the dome-shaped, dimly lit chamber, automatic rifles rested on cots.
A little farther into the palace, on a higher terrace, a sentry with an automatic
rifle stood in a sandbagged watchtower. Pari Mahal had become
the world's most beautiful paramilitary camp.

I began retracing my visits to the other monuments of Kashmir. I
thought of the library of Islamia College, the oldest college in Srinagar,
which was burned down in a battle along with many rare manuscripts,
including a 1,400-year-old Quran handwritten by Usman, the third
caliph of Islam. The 600-year-old shrine of Nooruddin Rishi, the patron
Sufi saint of Kashmir, was destroyed in a gun battle between Indian
troops and the militants. Hindu temples and Buddhist stupas, circular
domed Buddhist shrines, were dying of neglect and misuse, as much a
victim of the conflict as people.

The great Indian emperor Ashoka, whose empire covered most of
South Asia, founded Srinagari (the City of Wealth) around 250 B.C.
on the outskirts of what is modern Srinagar. After one bloody battle,
Ashoka renounced violence, became a Buddhist, and dedicated his life
to promoting the religion's teachings. It was from the Buddhist seminaries
of Kashmir that missionaries spread Buddhism to China and Japan. In
1905 a team of archaeologists led by Daya Ram Sahani, then chief archaeologist
of Kashmir, excavated remains of stupas and found Buddhist idols
and images of Hindu gods on the mountainside of Pandrethan. Most of
those artifacts are stored at the Sri Pratap Singh Museum, named after an
eighteenth-century ruler. The only museum in Srinagar is a short walk
from the Zero Bridge. Coils of barbed wire lay in front of the tiny gate
to the crumbling museum building; soldiers manned a bunker nearby.
In the dusty hall, the caretakers gossiped behind a wooden reception
counter. They stared at me, the lone visitor, as if I had walked into their
living room.

After the awkwardness melted away, I met Mohammed Iqbal, a
middle-aged local archaeologist who, despite the conflict, continued to
publish booklets about the ancient monuments of Kashmir. The main
hall was filled with sculptures from Pandrethan. Iqbal stopped near a glass
box containing two free-standing statues. One, a greenish-gray granite
idol, portrayed the Buddha after he had renounced the world. His face
was broken, but he meditated on. "Look at his half-closed Mongoloid
eyes and high eyebrows. That is the Gandharan style, which was highly
influenced by the Greek tradition," Iqbal said as he looked at the idol
with a smile. He then turned my attention to a black granite statue that
depicted the birth of the Buddha as Prince Siddhartha to Queen Maya.
Maya, wearing a jeweled crown, two necklaces, and an ornate armband,
sat under a tree clutching a branch with one hand and supported by her
similarly adorned sister on the other side. "It is not a mere statue, it
is a story," explained Iqbal. "Queen Maya, pregnant with Buddha, goes
into labor in a forest in Lumbini on the way to her father's house. In her
moment of agony, she clutches a branch of a tree and is supported by
her sister." The facial features of Maya and her sister are Mongoloid, like
those of Buddha. "The ornamentation was the influence of the Maurya
and Gupta sculpture of India; the facial features were determined by the
Gandharan School. The combination of these two styles was what made
the Kashmir school," Iqbal explained.

Farther into the museum, we came across a massive granite sculpture
of the Hindu god Shiva, excavated near Pandrethan. It dated to the third
century, after Kashmir had reverted to Hinduism. Although the religion
had changed, the Buddhist influence was very vivid --- the Shiva here looked
like Buddha, except with a third eye on the forehead. Many more statues
of Buddha, his disciples, and various Hindu gods and goddesses lined the
museum hall. Iqbal believed much could be found if the Pandrethan excavations
were resumed. But that wasn't likely to happen. "After the monarchy
ended and the maharajah acceded to India in 1947," he told me, "the
military established their headquarters in the Pandrethan area. After that,
because of security reasons, no excavations were allowed there. Things
became worse after the conflict, and I haven't been able to visit the Pandrethan
archaeological sites that fall under the military camp."

I left the museum to visit the site where some of these statues had
been excavated, a mile south of the military headquarters. I walked past
the military camp and its propaganda billboards with pictures of smiling,
self-conscious soldiers pouring water for old Kashmiri men or showing
affection to Kashmiri children. Beneath the pictures were the words:
_LOVE TRANSCENDS ALL BARRIERS_.

A little ahead, I found the village --- a small market with signs for
soft drinks and potato chips and a cluster of shabby brick-and-cement
houses stretching across the plain to the mountains beyond. There were
no sites to visit --- they still fell under military control --- but I was curious
whether the villagers knew anything about Ashoka's Srinagar. Two
old men vaguely remembered excavations decades ago, but they hadn't
heard of Ashoka or his city.

When I was a child, my father told me stories of the Fourth World
Buddhist Council, held in Kashmir in the second century under the rule
of the learned Gandharan Buddhist king Kanishka. Every now and then
someone claimed to have found the true location of the council, but
most believed it was held near the ancient Garden of Harwan on the
northeastern fringe of Srinagar. On a family excursion to the garden
--- lined with waterways and shaded by towering chinar trees --- my father
pointed to the hillock above and told me it was where the council was
believed to have gathered.

I went there a few days after visiting the Srinagar museum. A sign,
_BUDDHIST SITES_, guided me to a terraced area where, in 1905, archaeologists
found a stupa, a prayer hall, and living quarters. In the center of
the site were the remains of the stupa. I stared at its stone base and two
concentric squares of roughly polished stones covered with wild grass.
It was hard to imagine what it might have looked like. To the left were
four fallen stone walls covered with moss. "That was a _vihara_, where the
monks met," said Mohammed Khazer, an elderly caretaker who worked
for the Archaeological Survey of India, which maintained the site.
According to Chinese traveler Hieun Tsang, more than five thousand
monks had come together to debate and discuss the faith.

In the museum, I had seen the artifacts from Harwan. They had no
relation to the Buddhist council but were fine examples of Gandharan
artwork --- terra-cotta tiles of floral motifs, an Indo--Greek-looking man
running after a deer with a spear, a woman wearing delicate earrings
walking with a pitcher on her head, and a husband and wife in conversation
on a balcony. The ruins at Harwan hardly seemed a tourist attraction.
"Earlier, tourists from Japan and even America would come here,"
Khazer said, "but nobody came here after the fighting began." Despite
the conflict, which devastated Khazer's home village, he continued to
spend his days at the site. The task of guarding the monuments was left
to watchmen like Khazer after the Archaeological Survey of India moved
its office from Srinagar to the southern city of Jammu.

Next to the central ruins, Khazer showed me a recently built wall of
polished pebbles interspersed with rough rocks. "The _VIHARAS_ and the
stupas were all built like this around the first century. Now some of our
archaeologists are trying to create replicas using the same material," he
said. There was no other sign of restoration work. The night before, a
poet friend wrote to me in an e-mail: "Lovers leave debris like civilizations
do." I looked at the debris of the stupa and thought, _Civilizations leave
debris like lovers do_.

Back in Srinagar, I visited the Akhund Mullah mosque that the enlightened
Mughal prince Dara Shikhoh built for his teacher on the slope of
Hari Parbat hill in central Srinagar. I found parts of the complex taken
over by squatters. The blue limestone walls of the square edifice were
giving way. Its domed roof was falling apart. Some arched windows were
gone, replaced by ugly imitations. A Turkish bath next to the mosque
had been converted into a gymnasium by the neighborhood youth, and
posters of Arnold Schwarzenegger hung from its walls. I read the delicate
calligraphy of poetry and Quran verses written on the tiles of the
mosque's facade. Hordes of pigeons flew in and out of the holes in the
roof; a lonely brass lock hung from the door, which clung to its hinges
like a memory of a long-forgotten lover.

Srinagar is a medieval city dying of a modern war. It is empty streets,
locked shops, angry soldiers, and boys with stones. It is several thousand
military bunkers, four golf courses, and three half-decent bookshops. It
is wily politicians repeating their lies about war and peace to television
cameras and small crowds gathered by the promise of an elusive job or
a daily fee of a few hundred rupees. It is stopping on sidewalks and at
traffic lights when the convoys of rulers and their patrons in armored
cars secured by machine guns rumble on broken roads. It is staring back
or looking away, resigned. Srinagar is never winning and never being
defeated.

Srinagar newspapers regularly carry obituaries of dead rebels with
young somber faces along with the elegies for the smiling, aging men in
expensive suits who guard-the gates of privilege. Some print headlines
in red, announcing deaths. Some run a box on the front page, giving the
daily updated statistics. Srinagar is being in a coffee shop, in an office,
outside a college, crossing a bridge, and feeling, touching, breathing
history, politics, and war, in unmarked signs and landmarks. Srinagar is
seeing a bridge, a clearing, a nondescript building and knowing that men
fell here, that a boy was tortured there.

As a reporter, I had the chance to meet Merajuddin, a veteran Kashmiri
news photographer, who looked the part in his photographer's
jacket. Merajuddin always wore dark sunglasses after he lost his left eye
to a splinter from a hand grenade. I once asked him how he had dealt
with the violence he encountered as a photographer. He spoke like a
man who had seen it all. "I cried like a child when the protesters were
massacred at Gawkadal Bridge. Nothing I saw after that made me cry."
I remember sitting with my family in my village and hearing the news
of the Gawkadal massacre on the BBC World Service; most eyes were
moist. The next afternoon I walked with the young and old, men and
women, boys and girls of my village shouting slogans in a protest against
the massacre. I was too young to understand how brutal brutality could
be. But as I grew up and began to understand, the memory haunted me.

Gawkadal was a few hundred yards from Lal Chowk. One afternoon
as I was crossing Lal Chowk, a crowd of girls in bright white uniforms
emerged from the gates of the nearby women's college, causing
a stir amid the clusters of boys loitering around like awkward clones
of pop stars. It was the only moment when you saw so many Kashmiri
women, who always preferred bright pink, red, blue, and green, wearing
white. The boys in a rainbow of 'T-shirts and regulation denims seemed
awestruck. Seeing them reminded me of a recent cartoon in a local
newspaper that had depicted a boy holding a begging bowl outside the
women's college.

It was a scene that repeated itself every afternoon outside every
college and school in Kashmir. Though a largely patriarchal society,
Kashmir did put a premium on educating its girls, and they were doing
well, winning places in every competitive test --- be it the medical colleges,
the engineering colleges, the sought-after research degrees in
law, journalism, biochemistry, and computer sciences at Kashmir University
or elsewhere. On graduating, they were taking their deserved
places in the workforce --- as teachers, bank managers, doctors, professors,
lawyers, journalists, and architects. It was something I always took
for granted, growing up surrounded by Mother's five sisters, each of
whom got a master's degree in humanities and trained further in teaching
before joining various schools and colleges.

Barely a few hundred meters from this lovely chaos was the Maisuma
area --- a stronghold of the pro-independence Jammu and Kashmir Liberation
Front. Newspapers called it the Gaza Strip of Kashmir. Maisuma
was a crowded bazaar, and the smell from the cinnamon and cardamom
piled on shop fronts in jute sacks wafted across the street. The
other smell of Maisuma was that of burning tires and tear gas when the
shops were closed and people protested arrests and custodial killings.
The Gawkadal Bridge had fallen like the protesters of January 1990. The
skeleton remained, two dilapidated pillars standing in a canal full of
filth.

On the other side of the bridge was a bunker, and outside the bunker
stood two soldiers. A hawker sold bananas from a wooden cart nearby;
two men stood next to the cart eating hungrily. I asked them about the
massacre. One of them, a man in his mid-thirties whose paunch struggled
against his cheap blue sweatshirt, said, "I was in that demonstration."
He tossed a banana peel into the muddy canal and told me the
place was under curfew for three days; soldiers had cordoned off the
massacre site with barbed wire, and armored vehicles were positioned
on all lanes. Paramilitaries had offered the residents lentils and bread
during the curfew. "But we refused to take their food. Our mothers told
us to wear shoes and leave for Pakistan for \[arms\] training," he said. He
picked up another banana and said, "After the massacre, I carried fifteen
bodies to the mosque. Their eyes were open; I closed their eyes with
my own hands. I will take you to the mosque and show you where we
laid the bodies. I will show you the pictures of the bodies, and you can
meet the women whose men were killed. But I cannot talk like this.
You should bring a television camera, record my interview, and show
it on _Aaj Tak_ \[an Indian news channel\]." I stared at him and protested
that I did not have a television camera; he insisted. "Get a camera and
come before Monday; I have work on Monday. Ask anyone about Babloo
Painter, and they will bring you to me. I am world-famous here."

An hour later, over coffee, I narrated my encounter with the world-famous
Babloo Painter to some friends. A friend reminded me of an
engineer who had survived the massacre. "I think he was with the
waterworks department," he said. Phone calls to the local waterworks
department got me nowhere. I was keen to meet the engineer who had
survived Gawkadal.

A week later, I got a call from my friend. I was helping my ten-year-old
cousin browse the Internet. We had barely managed to open a few
pages with the painfully slow dial-up connection when the phone rang.
"Basharat, that engineer lives close to your house. His name is Farooq
Wani. Take down his number."

Farooq Wani was home when I called. "I live on Green Lane, Rajbagh.
Come over, we will have tea," he said. Green Lane was a mile away from
my house, an upper-middle-class road lined with a row of redbrick mansions
with conical Kashmiri roofs. A girl watered flowers outside the
engineer's house. She directed me toward the drawing room. A plump
fortysomething man with bluish eyes and light brown hair, wearing a
dark blue suit, opened the door. "I am Farooq." He smiled and shook my
hand. Walnut wood-carved chairs and tables rested on a carpet. Papier-mâché figures sat lightly on the shelves of the cupboards. Farooq and I
sat facing each other.

In January 1990 he was an assistant engineer in the state government
responsible for the management of the water supply to various parts
of Srinagar. He was on essential services duty on January 19 and left
home in the morning with his official curfew pass. Paramilitary Central
Reserve Police Force men stopped him a few times on his way to work; ;
he showed his curfew pass, and they let him go. After making water supply
arrangements, he walked toward Maisuma to visit an uncle. "We had
heard of the house-to-house searches and arrests there. I was worried
about my uncle's family and decided to visit them." Near Lal Chowk,
he saw a procession marching toward Maisuma. "I followed the procession.
We reached Gowkadal. Tense paramilitary men stood along the
way, pointing their guns toward the protesters."

Farooq paused, drank some water, and pushed a bell. A servant
brought tea, local bread, and _harisa_, a lamb delicacy cooked slowly in
copper pots with cardamom, cinnamon, and saffron till it becomes
pastelike. "My uncle lived on the other side of the bridge. I planned to
leave the procession on reaching his house. The protesters were angry,
shouting fiery slogans at the top of their voices," he said. Paramilitary
men stood on the bridge. Protesters shouted slogans for freedom. Amid
the sloganeering, Farooq heard a burst of gunfire. Bullets tore apart the
procession; people shouted, fell, and shouted again. He jumped onto a
footpath and lay flat on the ground. "Bullets whizzed past my ears. The
bridge was covered with bodies and blood. CRPF men continued firing.
I saw more people falling, closed my eyes, and pretended to be dead."

Farooq curled himself up in the chair, leaving his slippers on the carpet.
I was not eating anymore; Farooq had left his tea. Memory drowned
out the smell of _harisa_; the elegant carpets and ornate furniture faded
away. Farooq was not here in his drawing room talking to me. He was
on the bridge pretending to be dead. He heard wails and a gunshot every
few seconds. Paramilitary men walked around the bridge. He saw an officer
going from body to body, checking whether anyone was alive. "I lay
still and, from the corner of my eye, saw him firing more bullets every
time he found a sign of life in an injured man." Farooq waited for the
soldiers to leave. It was getting harder to pretend to be dead. Where he
lay, someone had dropped a _kangri_, the fire pot Kashmiris carry around
in winter. Embers of charcoal from the _kangri_ were scattered on the sidewalk.
His cheek was burning from their heat. Slowly, he turned his face
to avoid the burn. The murdering officer saw him. "This bastard is alive,"
Farooq heard him shout. The officer ran toward him, kicked him, and a
volley of bullets pierced his body. He lost consciousness.

A police truck came. The bodies were put in the truck; the police put
him in, too. The truck moved to the police control room, which was
to become the site where Kashmiris would go to collect bodies of their
kin in the days to come. Inside the truck, Farooq regained consciousness
and lay still. The truck stopped at the police hospital two miles
from Gawkadal. As the policemen at the hospital began taking out the
bodies, he cried out, "I am alive!" The policemen, all Kashmiris, hugged
him. They were carrying him away when a teenager whose clothes and
face were drenched in blood jumped out of the pile of bodies. The boy
ran his hands over his body and cried, "I got no bullets. I got no bullets.
I am alive." He stood still for a moment and then ran out of the building.
Farooq was hospitalized. His family heard he was alive a day later.
"They thought I was dead."

Months later, he recovered and resumed work as an engineer. "God
gave me a new life that day; I thank him and live every moment. I often
think of that boy running from the police hospital. Memories like that
disturb me. But I was not the only one; there are hundreds like me."

We had another round of _kahwa_ and continued talking about Kashmir
for a while. He wondered if the conflict would ever be resolved and if
there could be a just and lasting peace. It was a question most Kashmiris
talked about. None of us knew the answer. Then his phone rang: one of
his subordinates. Farooq gave him complicated technical directions. As
he spoke with intense focus, it was hard to imagine the same man had
survived one of the most appalling massacres in Kashmir. In a corner
was a golf bag; now he was a member of Srinagar's posh golf club.

***

My ten-year-old cousin, Iffat, was waiting for me at home to help
her with a school essay. "Who did you go to meet?" she asked me the
moment I walked in.

"A friend of mine," I said.

"What does he do?"

"He is an engineer."

"Why did you go to see him?"

Her questions could be endless, and I suggested that we should work
on her essay. Afterward, I sat alone in my room thinking about Farooq,
about Babloo Painter and Gawkadal. For me, the massacre of Gawkadal
is tied up with the memory of a series of other massacres. In the winter
of 1990 Srinagar was the city of massacres. Militants joined the Indian
forces in a display of brutality. Mushir-ul-Haq, the vice chancellor of
Kashmir University, was kidnapped and killed after the Indian government
refused to accept the militant demands for the release of hostages.
Prominent Kashmiri Pandits and Muslims seen as siding with India were
the next target. On May 21, 1990, militants from _Hizbul Mujahideen_, a
pro-Pakistan militant group, assassinated the head priest of Srinagar,
Maulvi Farooq, a controversial politician. A procession of mourners
began from his house in the northern part of Srinagar.

Near a hundred-year-old school in central Srinagar established by
Maulvi Farooq's father to educate Kashmir's Muslims, paramilitary
forces fired at the slain priest's funeral procession. Bullets pierced the
coffin; pallbearers and mourners fell. About a hundred men were slain.
Their blood-soaked shoes lay on the road after the bodies were carried
away. People forgot the head priest's assassination; anger rose against
India. His eighteen-year-old son, Omar Farooq, who was sworn in as
the head priest, appealed to world leaders to help Kashmir seek selfdetermination.
The images of the massacre found their way into poetry
and paintings.

Many of the mourners were buried in a new graveyard that had come
up near Eidgah, the traditional Eid prayer ground of Srinagar. For centuries
Kashmiris had buried the dead in neighborhood graveyards. Family
members gave the dead person a bath, clothed him/her in a white cotton
shroud, and took the body to the graveyard for funeral prayers. But
the men who had been killed by the Indian forces since the rebellion
were no ordinary dead. They were seen as martyrs for the cause of freedom.
They were not given a bath or white cotton shrouds. "Martyrs do
not need baths and shrouds." I had heard this saying often since the winter
of 1990. The men were buried mostly at the newly built graveyard on
the western edge of Srinagar, known to Kashmiris as _Martyrs' Graveyard_.
I had been there as a reporter after every newsworthy assassination or
on the anniversary of the day when the mourners and the head priest
were slain. But I had been there first in the mid-nineties with my friend
Shan, who lived nearby.

Bordering Shan's crowded neighborhood of old balconied multistory
timber-and-brick houses was a wide grassy playground where local boys
played cricket and horses and stray cows grazed. I revisited the place
with Shan. In a corner, the graveyard was a neatly walled square with
an arched entrance announcing: _KASHMIR MARTYRS' GRAVEYARD_. Inscribed
on the gate are the words: _LEST YOU FORGET WE HAVE GIVEN OUR TODAY FOR
TOMORROW OF YOURS_. In his adolescence, Shan sat at the nearby shop
fronts and watched bodies being brought to the graveyard and journalists
running around with notebooks and cameras.

We passed through the iron-grille graveyard gate and walked on the
cobbled footpaths running between the graves and the defiant reds and
violets of roses and irises. Hundreds lay buried in neat rows, each grave
marked with a rectangular white marble tombstone with a green border
engraved with the name of the dead and the exhortation: _ONLY GOD
REMAINS!_ Many of the names were familiar to me: Maulvi Farooq, the
head priest, and Ishfaq Majeed, the commander of JKLF, to whose name
was added the prefix "His Excellency." There was a grave for Maqbool
Bhat, the founder of JKLF, who was hanged and buried in Delhi's Tihar
jail in the early eighties. On his tombstone were the words: _THE GRAVE
WAITS FOR HIM_. And there were unknown men and women from all parts
of Kashmir. In one grave two children --- four and five years old --- were
buried together. Most graves named the killers: police, army, security
forces --- as if they, too --- were to be immortalized.

In a corner were a few empty graves. Hasan, the old keeper of the
graveyard, told us they had been dug in anticipation of the brisk death
toll in the early nineties. Hasan lived nearby and used to run a small
business. His sons took over after he developed a cardiac problem. Then
the fighting began; he visited the graveyard often to pray for the dead. "I
found peace sitting among the martyrs. Some years later, I volunteered
to look after their graves. Now this is my life." Hasan believed, like most
traditional Muslims, that martyrs live after their death and their graves
are scented gardens. "Once it rained hard, and some graves were damaged,"
he said. "Nothing remains in an ordinary grave after a month but
earth. But not with the martyrs; their bodies do not decompose. In a
grave I saw the hair of a martyr. It was as if he was sleeping. From every
grave I repaired, there rose a heavenly scent, the scent of the martyrs."
I must have had a skeptical look on my face, because he said, "Son, you
are too young to understand this, but I have experienced it."

The tale of Kashmiri rebellions, their brutal suppression by the rulers
and honoring the dead as _martyrs_, is an old one. In Srinagar people still
visit the graves of men who stood up to rulers and were killed for their
defiance centuries ago. There is another Martyrs' Graveyard, where the
men who were killed in 1931 by the forces of the Dogra ruler of Kashmir,
Hari Singh, are buried. Kashmir had various foreign rulers after losing
independence to the Mughal emperors of Delhi in the late sixteenth
century. In the mid-eighteenth century, the Mughals lost Kashmir to the
armies of the Afghan warrior Ahmad Shah Abdali. And in the early nine-teenth
century, the Sikhs led by Ranjit Singh defeated the Afghans and
took Kashmir. The Sikh rule was as oppressive as the Afghan rule. Sikh
governors closed down mosques and banned the Muslim call for prayer.
Heavy taxes were levied; peasants were forced into hard labor. But by
the 1840s the Sikh empire was crumbling.

The British declared war on the Sikhs in 1846. Many Sikh commanders
crossed over to the British. But the defection that was to have consequences
for Kashmir was that of Gulab Singh --- a Hindu chieftain of the
hill state of Jammu --- which is a neighbor of the valley of Kashmir. He had
worked his way up to be a general in Ranjit Singh's army. Gulab Singh
promised to help the British and stayed away from battle in 1846. The
Sikhs lost. Gulab Singh got his reward. The British sold Kashmir to him
for seventy-five _lakhs_ of rupees. To recover the price he'd paid the British,
Gulab Singh pounced on every penny he found and promoted _begaar_
(forced labor).

A few voices were heard against the sale of Kashmir and the plight of
its people under the rule of Gulab Singh and his descendants. Some years
ago in a library in Delhi, I came across a tiny book printed in London,
titled _Cashmeer Misgovernment_, by Robert Thorpe, but his book told me
nothing about his own life. On a visit home I found in my father's library
an edition of Thorpe's book, edited by a Srinagar-based historian. The
historian had added some details. The story began when R. Thorpe, a
lieutenant colonel in the British army, was traveling through Kashmir
in the early nineteenth century. While staying with a local landlord, he
met the man's daughter Amiran. Thorpe and Amiran fell in love, were
married, and left for England. Robert Thorpe was born to them in the
year 1833.

In his early youth, Thorpe left England to visit his mother's birthplace;
he found Kashmiris living like slaves under Gulab Singh's son
Pratap Singh. He gathered firsthand accounts of the ruthless taxation
and the death of forced laborers due to starvation, exertion, and cold,
and he published his accounts as _Cashmeer Misgovernment_. Thorpe described
the condition of men taken for forced labor: "None save those who have
seen such can fully realise those horrors. Patiently the Kashmiris toil
onwards through the drifting snow. Many encourage each other with
words of hope. They might reach the other side in safety. But strength
departs and the wind paralyses the sinews. Slowly the conviction fastens
upon them that they shall never quit those frightful solitudes, never see
again their homes or those who dwelt there waiting for their return,
far off in the sunny vale of Kashmir." Pratap Singh planned to silence
Thorpe. One winter morning in 1868, Thorpe was walking toward the
Shankaracharya hill in Srinagar. Singh's men attacked him with daggers.
The brave writer fell and died there. He was buried in a Christian cemetery
behind Lal Chowk.

Young boys and girls from two convent schools made a racket in the
street leading to the cemetery. Tibetans who sought refuge in Kashmir
in the 1960s sold shoes and clothes on the sidewalks. I saw the inscription
_CHRISTIAN CEMETERY_ on a small iron gate. Inside, three men sat on
the pavement. I asked them about Robert Thorpe's grave; they had never
heard of him. "The graves here are of local converts," a thickset man
said. Then he pointed at the far end of the cemetery. "You will see graves
of important British sahibs and memsahibs there." Weeds grew around
the limestone and marble stones on the graves; majestic chinar and pine
trees shaded the terraced cemetery. The thickset man joined me and
asked me to translate the epitaphs in English. Every time he realized a
grave was a hundred years old, he cried out loud, "Nothing lasts! We all
have to return to Him! He was and only He will be! We all have to return
to Him!" I could not find Thorpe anywhere.

I was reading an epitaph when the man shook me by my shoulder and
asked me for fifty rupees. "I will show you a very important grave. Many
people come to see that and take pictures." He ushered me toward an
old tomb; time had turned the limestone black. Weeds, wild grass, and
twigs covered the slab. "Do you know anything about him?" I asked the
man. He smiled an obsequious smile. "No! But he is a very important
man." I removed the twigs and the grass and scrubbed the mud off the
slab. The modest carving on the stone read:

>ROBERT THORPE

>AGED 30 YEARS

>22 NOVEMBER 1868

Srinagar is a city of bunkers. Of the world's cities, it has the greatest
military presence. But Srinagar is also a city of absences. It has lost its
nights to a decade and a half of curfews and de facto curfews. It has
lost its theaters: Regal, Shiraz, Neelam, Broadway --- magical names I had
longed for throughout my childhood. They were closed before I had
grown up enough to walk to a ticket counter and watch a bad Bollywood
movie.

Srinagar has also lost its multi-religious character with the migration
of the Kashmiri Pandits in the early nineties. I remembered my Pandit
landlady in Delhi; she always talked about visiting her old home in Srinagar.
I did not know where her house was, but I could visit the area
where she had lived: Habbakadal, central Srinagar. One afternoon I
walked into a coffee shop near the dilapidated Habbakadal Bridge, the
third bridge on the Jhelum River as it moves through Srinagar. A teenager
in an Adidas T-shirt manned the sales counter. His father owned the
shop. I asked him about places of interest in Habbakadal. "There is nothing
to see here. It is a ruin. Go down the road, and you will see some
burned houses." He shrugged.

I was about to leave when an elderly man came in. The boy swiftly
threw his cigarette away. "He is my father." He jumped off his chair. The
father sat behind the sales counter and watched people pass by. I asked
him about the area. "Turn left, and the second building from my shop is
an ancient Hindu temple," he said.

I left, walked up to the temple door, and stopped. The temple complex
now housed a paramilitary camp. Fortified bunkers along the wall
hid the temple from sight; I saw the tin roof of the temple and a brass
spire. A gray-painted iron sheet was attached to a sandbag bunker. On it,
bold black graffiti read: _INDIA IS GREAT!_ An Indian flag hung from a mast
tied to a bunker.

On the bridge, used only by pedestrians, a group of old men sat in
the pleasant afternoon sun. I sat near them looking at the old wooden
houses along the riverbank. On a _ghat_ --- or river bank --- women washed
clothes, and children ran up and down the stairs leading to the _ghat_. One
of the old men, Abdul Razaq, pointed to the crumbling old houses along
the riverbank and said, "Most of them are Pandit houses. Pandits left,
and now they are abandoned." His eyes wandered over their decaying
wooden windows and shingle roofs covered in neglect and dust. Mrs.
Kaul, my landlady, would have lived in one such house not very far from
where I stood. On the left bank, the brass-plate roof of an ancient temple
reflected the mild sun. "It is the Raghunath temple, one of the best
here," the old man told me.

I walked through a stone-paved street sneaking between rows of new
concrete buildings and old wood houses. The ground floors of the houses
had been converted into shops, and the shopkeepers sat lazily behind
their wooden counters. In a crumbling building with a burned top floor
and roof, a shop announced: _NEW GENERATION CHOICE --- LATEST BOLLYWOOD
AND HOLLYWOOD VCDS AND DVDS_. The street turned into a narrow alley. I
asked a ponytailed little girl where the Raghunath temple was. She ran
ahead, beckoning me to follow her, and stopped near a broken wall.

I climbed over the broken wall and jumped onto a garbage dump
inside the temple courtyard. Stray dogs camping inside the temple
barked at me. The brass plates of the roof had fallen apart and exposed
the baked bricks of the temple. Reeds and wild bushes had invaded the
courtyard and the stairs leading into the prayer room. After walking
through a triple-arched gallery, I entered the prayer room. It was filled
with cobwebs, pigeon droppings, and a gloomy silence. Naked bricks
stared at me; I walked over pieces of their plaster scattered on the floor.
The Hindu deity's idol had gone missing from the podium, like the Pandits.
A horde of pigeons flew into the prayer hall, fluttered around, and
flew out into the dusk over the River Jhelum and the city.

Two shabbily dressed young men stood in the courtyard. They
were startled to see me; they were smoking pot. Refugees from sanity
had found shelter in the abandoned temple. After introductions, they
warmed up and offered me a drag. I refused. "Okay. But tell me, why did
you come here?" one asked.

"I saw the temple roof from a distance and was curious to take a
look."

He took a drag from the joint and looked at the temple. "When I
was a child, it used to be crowded with people. The Pandits sang _bhajans_
all evening. Then they left. Now only _djinns_ live here." The setting sun
shone meekly in the darkening waters of the Jhelum. On the way back,
I passed through Lal Chowk and crossed the Jhelum again. The dark
roads and the gloomy river seemed to be mourning the lost gods and
worshippers.

I found myself thinking of Hari Parbat, a hill that towers over central
Srinagar and is associated with the legend of the creation of Kashmir. In
prehistoric times there was a vast lake known as Satisar, after the Hindu
god Shiva's wife, Parvati, also called Sati. In the lake lived a demon who
laid waste to the whole country around Satisar. Kashyapa the sage witnessed
this destruction and prayed to the Hindu trinity of Brahma,
Vishnu, and Shiva to rid the place of the demon. The demon escaped
underwater each time the gods attacked him. Then Vishnu assumed the
form of a boar and struck the mountains surrounding the lake. Where
he struck, a pass opened and water drained out. (The present northern
Kashmir town of Baramulla is believed to be the place where Vishnu
struck the mountains.) The demon escaped to lower ground near central
Srinagar; Parvati assumed the form of a mynah and dropped a pebble on
him. The pebble became a mountain and killed the demon. Kashmiris
believe that mountain is Hari Parbat.

A steep, narrow alley leads up to Hari Parbat from a market in central
Srinagar. Midway stands a famed Sufi shrine. Hari Parbat rises above the
shrine in its solid barrenness, crowned by the massive beige walls of a
fort built by a medieval Afghan ruler. One afternoon I climbed higher
toward the fort; a temple dedicated to Parvati stands there. Two old men
chatted beside the track I followed. I asked them about the gate of the
fort. "The gate is there. But where are you going?" one asked. "To the
fort. I want to see the temple," I replied. He looked at the other man,
and they sighed. "Don't you know? It is a camp." I looked at the fort
walls and saw the barrel of a gun pointing from an opening in the fort
wall. "There used to be a temple, a mosque, a pond, and a few apricot
trees there," he added. "Now it is all military."

Srinagar is also about being hidden from view, disappearing.
Absences and their reminders stand on every other street. Every now
and then I would be walking past a small park shaded by thick chinars
and notice a circle of women and men with white headbands and placards.
I would stop at times; other times I would walk past with an air
of resignation. Between four and eight thousand men have disappeared
after being arrested by the military, paramilitary, and police. Newspapers
routinely referred to the missing men as "disappeared persons"
and their waiting wives as the "half-widows." The government has
refused to set up an inquiry into the disappearances, saying the missing
citizens of Kashmir have joined militant groups and crossed into Pakistan
for arms training. Many Kashmiris believe the disappeared men
were killed in custody and cremated in mass graves. Wives of many
such men have given up hope and tried to move on. Others are obses
sively fighting for justice, hoping their loved ones will return. The men
and women in the park were the parents and wives of the missing men.
Dirty wars seem to have a way of bringing mothers to city squares.

Several years ago I happened to meet Noora, a seventy-year-old
woman, in her rundown house near Lal Chowk. Her shopkeeper son
had stepped out to join his cricket team at the Polo Ground. Her neighbors
saw a few Border Security Force jeeps stop outside their house, near
Ghanta Ghar, an old watchtower whose clock had stopped working. The
paramilitaries grabbed him, pushed him into the back of a jeep, and drove
away. He had been missing for eight years when I met her in her dimly lit
kitchen. "For a few years, my daughters and I went to every police station,
every military camp, every politician we could. Everybody had a
no for us. And then I had to marry off my two daughters. I couldn't keep
dragging them to camps and police stations with me. People talk." Her
wrinkled face showed little emotion; she seemed tired of repeating her
story and getting nowhere. "Many journalists came and interviewed me.
Even some _angrez_ came and promised they will write about my son. But
my son has not come back."

Neither has the son of Parveena Ahanger, a sixteen-year-old speechimpaired
boy, Javed, who was taken away from their house in 1990 during
a raid by the army. Parveena is a chubby housewife in her forties
who, along with a lawyer, Pervez Imroz, formed the Association of Parents
of Disappeared Persons to campaign and fight cases in the courts.
One day she is consoling and strategizing with relatives of other disappeared
youths, helping them with legal advice and charity schools for
children; another day she is at the Srinagar airport, catching a flight to
talk at a seminar; and yet another day she repeats her story elsewhere,
and her sad brown eyes hold back tears. Each time I have seen her, she
is with a new woman whose husband or son has gone missing. She is
a mother to them all, holding them, consoling them, scolding, egging
them on. Old bearded men talk to her with reverence, as if she is a saint.
Young rakish men sit on bare ground, their heads lowered, and listen to
her. Reporters stop to greet her and ask if there is something that needs
to be written about.

I remember sitting on that rug in her house, barely a year-old
reporter, taking notes, asking earnest questions, and naively believing
that telling her story well might bring her son back. The government had
offered her monetary compensation (around $2,500) if she accepted
that her son was killed in unknown circumstances in the conflict. "I
will not sell my son for any amount," she told me. The numbers of the
missing have come down since Parveena began her battle, but the disappearances
have not stopped. Every time the police and the military
announce that an unidentified body has been found, Parveena gets nervous
phone calls from the relatives of other missing men. "You never
know who it will be. One can hope as long as you have not seen the
body or the grave."

That pain and longing often remind Kashmiris of an old story of pain
and longing --- again inflicted by imperial Delhi. On the Srinagar--Jammu
highway, about six miles outside the city, a sign reads: _WORLD'S BEST SAFFRON
GROWS HERE_. Past the beds of violet saffron flowers, a dirt path leads
to the village of Chandhara, the village of Zoon, or Habba Khatoon, a
sixteenth-century poetess and singer. Despite her talents and refinement,
Zoon was married off to a peasant who insisted that she devote
herself to her household chores and working in the fields. Zoon sang her
songs as she tilled and planted.

The ruler of Kashmir at the time was Yusuf Shah Chak, a prince fond
of poetry and music. One day he was passing by the fields near Chandhara
when he saw Zoon singing. Yusuf Shah fell for her. Historians have competing
claims about their romance and marriage, but in Kashmiri folklore,
the peasant girl became Queen Habba Khatoon, spent joyous days
and nights with her husband in pleasure gardens, wrote poetry, refined
her singing, and composed classical music inspired by Yusuf Shah's court
full of musicians and singers.

However, they were caught in the whirligig of imperial politics.
Akbar, the Mughal emperor of Delhi, invaded Kashmir in December 1585.
Yusuf considered resistance futile, but his army fought and stopped
the Mughal march. Fearing an eventual defeat, Yusuf agreed to visit the
court of the Mughal emperor for peace talks, where he accepted Mughal
sovereignty. Kashmir lost its independence. Akbar imprisoned Yusuf and
a year later sent him to Bihar as a petty Mughal official; he died in anonymity
a few years later. Habba Khatoon roamed the villages of Kashmir,
singing songs of separation, yearning to be reunited with her beloved.
Yusuf died alone in faraway Bihar.

Despite his cowardice, Yusuf Shah's imprisonment and betrayal by
Akbar has become a metaphor for the relationship between Delhi and
Srinagar. In a literary history of Kashmir, I found a picture of Yusuf Shah's
grave in the village of Biswak in the Nalanda district of Bihar. Mohammed
Yusuf Taing, a Kashmiri writer and cultural critic, had been there
in the early 1980s with Kashmir's most respected leader and head of the
government, Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah. I met him in Srinagar in his
study lined with books. "A generation has passed since someone visited
his grave." His voice quivered with emotion. A week later, I called the
old writer and sought directions for the Bihar village where Yusuf Shah
was buried.

Some time after meeting Taing, I left Srinagar for Delhi and from
there boarded a night train for Patna. In the morning I took a taxi from
Patna and drove into the countryside. We passed tiny mud houses with
hay roofs scattered amid vast stretches of fields and obstinate bullock
carts unimpressed by cars; we overtook buses with commuters sitting
gaily on their roofs. I dozed off till the driver woke me up in a tiny market
in the small town of Islampur. A group of men in checked sarongs
and _kurtas_ drank _lassi_ on wooden benches outside a sweets shop. A young
man named Hari volunteered to accompany me. "The Kashmiri saint's
tomb is near Biswak, where I live," he explained. "It used to be a Muslim
village called Kashmiri Chak, but after Partition, the people migrated
to Pakistan." We followed a dirt track into sugarcane fields. A few miles
on, Hari asked the driver to stop. A banyan tree towered over a mound
of bricks, partly covered with vegetation. We were there. On a raised
piece of land with a fallen brick boundary was a tomb. It had no plaques,
no inscriptions, and no names. Wind rustled the sugarcane; an old man
passed by, wearily pedaling a bicycle. I sat there for a while, looking at
the featureless grave of Yusuf Shah Chak, after whom Kashmir was never
free.
