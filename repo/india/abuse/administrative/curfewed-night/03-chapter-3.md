## Very Long Miles

The fighting had changed the meaning of distance. I came home
almost every weekend from school. The black sliver of the
road made its way through an expanse of rice and mustard
fields, willow groves, grand Iranian maple or chinar trees alongside a
flamboyant stream, and the huddled houses of a few small villages. But
the six-mile ride on a local bus was dangerous. Military and paramilitary
trucks drove on the same road, carrying supplies between various camps
or going on raids in the villages. Guerrillas hiding in the fields by the
road would often fire at the military convoys or detonate mines planted
in the road. Soldiers would retaliate after such attacks, firing in all directions
and beating anyone they could lay their hands on.

One weekend on my way home, I was standing in the bus aisle near
the driver. Kashmiri buses are like noisy caf√©s; almost everyone knows
everyone else, and voices of varying pitches fill the vehicle. The driver
played a Bollywood song, its melancholy lyrics floating over the din.
A mile into the journey, a paramilitary convoy overtook our bus and
hovered just ahead of us. The voices in the bus lowered, and the driver
turned off the music. Soldiers had realized that driving close to a civilian
bus would keep guerrillas from attacking them. Anxiety filled the
bus. Our driver began praying feverishly: "God, I have three small children,
please don't make them orphans today. Please get us safely to our
homes today." We drove in silence, waiting. The minutes passed, and
the paramilitary convoy gathered speed. Our driver slowed, and the
distance between us grew. We were in a village called Siligam, midway
between my school and my house, when I heard a loud explosion. The
driver slammed on the brakes, and in the distance, we saw a paramilitary
truck skid off the road and land in the fields. I heard a barrage of
bullets --- the lighter sounds Kalashnikovs; the heavier, retaliatory bursts,
light machine guns. The driver swung the bus around and sped back as
fast as he could. Everyone crouched under the seats.

I sat on the floor, gripping a seat. The roar of the engine rose above
the sound of bullets being fired. I was thinking where a bullet might hit
me; I desperately hoped it would not be my face, my head, or my right
hand. I became intensely aware of my body. I felt the tension in my
spinal cord, the nakedness of my neck, the stiffening of my legs. Where
would a bullet hurt the most? I buried my head in my knees and closed
my eyes.

We were driving away from the battle. I began listing the guns that
could still hit us. We seemed out of the killing range of an AK-47 and a
carbine submachine gun, but a self-loading rifle, a light or heavy machine
gun, and a 51 mm mortar gun could easily hit us. A little while later,
the driver stopped the bus. I stood up in a quick, involuntary motion.
Two men hugged the driver. "You saved our life," another man said, and
shook his hand. An old man began to cry. A woman patted his back and
consoled him. I smiled at everyone. We got off the bus and drank from
a roadside stream. The driver and a few other men smoked cigarettes.

We had just gotten back on and begun to drive back to the bus yard
in the village of Aishmuqam, near my school, when a convoy of paramilitary
trucks hurtled toward us. The convoy stopped, and so did we.
Armed soldiers circled the bus, and an angry paramilitary officer ordered
us out. We stood in a queue on the road. I was close to the door and the
first one to get down. I was in my school uniform and carried a school
bag. The officer raised his gun like a baton. I waited to be hit by the
weapon. I could not remove my eyes from his. He lowered the gun and
pushed me with his other hand. I knew he was going to shoot me. But
then he grabbed my arm and shouted, "You are from the school near our
camp. I see you pass by every day. Now get out of here." He let the bus
and everyone on it go. As we arrived at the bus yard, a crowd gathered.

Two hours later, another bus arrived, and its driver told me, "You are
lucky that no soldier was killed by the land mine. The road is open now,
but they have begun a crackdown in the surrounding villages." Fifteen
minutes later, we passed the spot where the mine had gone off. I saw no
soldiers, no military trucks. There were only the willow trees lining the
road, the paddy fields, the tin roofs of a village beyond the fields, and
a large crater on the right corner of the road, carved out by the explosion.
We drove past a few villages where the shops had been closed and
the streets were empty except for patrolling paramilitary soldiers. Fortunately,
they let our bus pass.

A few weeks later, I was home again. That weekend we expected
Father to visit from his office in Srinagar, which was wracked with violence.
Each day on BBC World Service, we heard reports of scores of
deaths there. The solemn voice of Yusuf Jameel, the BBC's Srinagar correspondent,
rang through our radios each evening: "I am hearing the
sound of gunfire." The fatal sound of bullets would play on the radio
for a few seconds, and Jameel's stoic voice would follow: "Yet another
unidentified body has been found in the river Jhelum in Srinagar."

Late in the afternoon Mother sent me to buy lamb chops for the
dinner she was making for Father. I stepped out of the house and saw
Mother's grand-uncle, the white-haired Saifuddin, sitting by his grocery
counter and scanning the market. He didn't do much business but
knew everything that happened in the neighborhood, as he spent most
of his time watching who went where, and asking relentless questions.
He waved at me and asked, "Today is a Saturday! Is Peer Sahib coming
home?"

"Yes, he should be here soon," I replied.

"I only asked because I haven't seen Masterji \[my grandfather\] at the
butcher's shop yet. He usually buys meat by this time on a Saturday. I was
wondering if everything is fine. God knows this is a dangerous time."

I assured him that Grandfather was busy with some chore, and I was
buying the meat. I walked toward the butcher, and the few neighborhood
men hanging about the pharmacy and the tailor's shop called out,
"How was the interview?"

"Oh! The usual. He hadn't seen Grandfather buying meat yet," I said.

Everybody laughed. Abu, the butcher, was looking our way, smiling.
"This neighborhood won't be the same without Saifuddin. At least he
asks about everyone." He began cutting lamb chops for me, instructing
me along the way about the parts Grandfather would ask for. And then:
"Masterji must have gone to check the apple orchard. Or the fields."

"No, he is home, fixing some electrical stuff."

Then I noticed a group of young men with guns standing near the bus
stop. Tonga, the tall JKLF man from our village, was with them. Some
village boys had begun calling him Rambo, but the elders still called him
Tonga. A small crowd of villagers had gathered around Tonga and were
arguing about something. Abu and I looked at each other. "God knows
what Tonga is up to," he said, sighing. I rushed to find out. Tonga and his
cohorts were planning to attack a convoy of Indian troops supposed to
pass by our village. The villagers were trying to persuade them against
it. They were addressing Tonga by his real name. "Mohiuddin Sahib, you
are our son, you are from our own village. You have to stop this attack."
"Mohiuddin Sahib, you know what the soldiers do after an attack. Do
you want your own village burned?" "Have you forgotten we have young
daughters? Do you want soldiers to barge into our homes? Have the fear
of God, this is your own village!"

Tonga moved away from his sullen comrades to explain himself to
the villagers. "I know! I know! I swear by my mother, I can't do anything.
Every time my commanders plan an action here, I fight with them.
Don't I know? My old mother lives here; my three daughters live here."

Hasan the baker held Tonga's hands. "Please! Do something."

Abu joined in. "Mohiuddin dear, please. You can save the village.
Please."

Even the old Saifuddin left his perch and came up to him. "Mohiuddin
Sahib, you are my son. Rahet, your mother, is like my sister. Remember
that! And look at my white hair and white beard! Where will I run?"

Tonga held his hands. "You are like my father, and I am like your son.
But I can't stop it today. Please, close the shops and leave! Please, we
don't have much time."

The villagers gave up. The shopkeepers pulled their shutters. I ran
home. "Mummy, KLF people are outside. They are going to attack a convoy,"
I shouted. "Tonga is there, too, but he can't stop his commander.
We have to run." Everybody panicked. Mother folded the sleeves of her
_pheran_ and asked everyone to shut up. She was in schoolteacher mode,
and everyone listened to her. She hid the jewelry of her sisters that
was kept in our house. Grandfather got a bag of the family's academic
degrees, professional documents, cash, and passbooks. We were ready
to leave through the door opening onto the vegetable garden behind the
house. Then Mother said, "What about the books?" We looked at one
another.

Father had built his library over the years. Each book had his name
and a book number on the first page in either his scrawly handwriting
or in Mother's neater letters. I had spent long hours in his library.
There were the great Russian writers in thick People's Publishing House
hardbacks that were sold in the mobile bookshops run by the Communist
Party of India; there were the American and European novelists in
slim paperbacks; there were the great Urdu writers Premchand, Manto,
Ghalib, Iqbal, and Faiz. And there were histories, law books, commentaries
on religion and politics in South Asia. The most beautiful of my
father's books was _The Complete Works of William Shakespeare_ --- a thick edition,
leather-bound, with gold-tinted pages. His books were those of a
self-taught man, books that had shaped him, helped him build his life;
they made him stand out when he talked about worlds and ideas that
few men in our world could talk about. Touching their spines, running
my fingers along their fonts, feeling the smoothness of their paper, and
being mesmerized by their stories made me feel closer to Father and
that I shared his connection to a magical world.

But there was nothing to be done; we had to leave the books in
the house. We stepped into the backyard. Grandmother kept looking
toward the house. "Sahib must be here anytime," she repeated. The sun
was sinking in the sky, and we expected Father to arrive at any moment.
"God will keep him safe. There is nothing you can do by staring," Mother
shouted at her, and bolted the locks.

Our neighbors were standing on their lawns with a few bags. Yusuf
and his sons, Manzoor, Khalid, and Asif, were there. "Now what are we
staring at!" Grandfather roared, and we began walking away. Amin, the
chemist, was walking with his family; Abu, the butcher, was there with
his wife and sons. A little ahead, I saw Kaisar, the ribald tailor, helping
his father to safety. And Gul Khan, the old farmer who gave the call for
prayers, was carrying his tiny granddaughter on his shoulders. Soon our
walk turned into a run. I hoped that Father would hear about the attack
and stay away; I hoped that nobody would be killed in the attack and the
soldiers would not set our house on fire. I thought of some of my most
beloved things: books, the black-and-white television, the Sony radio,
the Polaroid camera.

Our village was emptying fast, almost everyone running toward
Numbul, the adjacent village. It lay across some paddy fields and the
Lidder, our local stream. The blue-green waters of the Lidder rushing
through the fields bubbled over the stones. The wild grass grew by the
stream, the willows swayed, and the paddies were ripening. The mountains
stood witness. In the open sky, crows and eagles wandered and
whirled. Indifferent. They continue with their own seasons.

We were half a kilometer from the Lidder when the first bullet was
fired. Yusuf tried running faster, Grandfather stopped, and Gul Khan lay
on his stomach in the fields, holding his granddaughter. I had an urge to
laugh when I saw that Yusuf was running with his left hand covering his
left cheek as if it could stop a bullet. Every few seconds, we heard the
crackle of bullets. Kalashnikovs used by the militants sounded different
from the machine guns and other rifles used by the soldiers. Yusuf's
son Manzoor tried to tell from the sounds who was shooting. "Now the
military is firing back. The militants seem to have stopped firing." His
normally calm father slapped him.

The guns were still booming when we reached Numbul. Every door
there was open to us. I do not know whose house we rushed into. We
were ushered into a room. People from our village were already there,
sitting silently along the wall, with half-empty cups of tea. As my family
followed Grandfather into the room, two young men stood up and
offered him and Grandmother their places; another took the cushion
he was leaning against and placed it against the wall for Grandfather.
"This is not a time for formality," Grandfather protested. Tea followed.
Nobody said much. We listened to the faint sound of gunfire.

After a while, Grandfather and a few other men stepped outside. I
followed. We stood looking toward our village; all I could see were distant
treetops, a few minarets, and the village mountain. Nobody said it,
but each of us was searching the horizon for flames and smoke. Gunpowder
doesn't take long to burn a village. But I saw no smoke, only a
slowly darkening sky.

imagined people stopping a local bus in a neighboring village, telling
the driver about the attack and turning it back. I imagined Father
holding his newspapers and office files, getting off the bus, and staying
with an acquaintance. But I could not ignore thoughts of the bus driving
toward our village or getting caught in cross fire. I fully understood for
the first time that he was making dangerous journeys week after week to
see us.

The guns fell silent some time later. We stayed in Numbul that night.
The next morning we headed back, anxious and edgy. Our walk home
was brisk, punctuated only by short greetings to acquaintances and
curious looks at village houses, searching for signs of the last evening's
battle. We came to a sudden stop when we reached our backyard. My
grandparents, Mother, my brother, my aunts, and I were transfixed for
a moment, staring at our untouched home, as if we had sighted a new
moon. I rushed into our courtyard. Father was standing on the veranda.
"I heard about it on the way and stayed in Islamabad at Mohammad
Amin's." He spoke casually.

I shook his hand. "Were you all right?"

Father smiled. "Yes! We were fine."

Grandfather repeated the details of our flight and our stay at Numbul.
I joined in and gave the account of seeing the militants on the road
and the conversations villagers had with Tonga. My younger brother
couldn't be silent either. "Daddy, Basharat was crying when we were
in Numbul." Father looked away, pretending not to hear him. "Let's go
inside!" he said.

We went around checking each room facing the road for signs of
damage. A few bullets were stuck in the ceiling in Father's room, and a
few more had pierced the walls in the drawing room and the guest room
facing the road. Grandfather pulled out the cartridges with pliers. We
looked at them for a few moments and then threw them away.

By late afternoon, Father was sitting in his usual corner in our drawing
room, a few books and a boiling samovar of tea by his side. My
brother and I sat facing him. Every now and then, a friend or a relative
would drop by, and tales of the previous night were recounted.
In between these tellings, Father would recite a verse or two of Urdu
poetry or a passage from Shakespeare and then turn to my brother and
me: "Whoever explains this verse will get five rupees."
