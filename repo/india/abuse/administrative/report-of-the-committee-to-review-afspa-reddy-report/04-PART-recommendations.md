/c The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (as amended by the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act, 2004) - A Cognate Legislation.

The ULP Act was enacted by the Parliament in 1967 to
confer powers upon the State authorities to deal with activities
directed against the integrity and sovereignty of India. The Act
defined 'unlawful activity' in clause (o) of Section 2. In short, it
meant any action taken by an individual or an association, in
whatever manner, "intended, or supports any claim, to bring
about, on any ground whatsoever", the cession of a part of the
territory of India or cession of a part of territory of India from the
Union or which disclaims, disrupts or is intended to disrupt the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of India _or_ which causes _or_ is
intended to cause disaffection against India. The expression
'unlawful organisation is defined in clause (p) to mean that any
association which has the objective of carrying on any unlawful
activity or any activity punishable under Section 153A or 153B of
the Indian Penal Code or which encourages or aids any person to
undertake such activity. The Act provided for declaring an
association as unlawful association whereupon certain
consequences provided in Sections 10 to 14 in Chapter III
followed. The declaration as an unlawful association shall,
however, be subject to scrutiny by a tribunal constituted under
Section 5 whose decision was binding upon the government. The
government was also empowered to prohibit the use of funds of
an unlawful association and also to notify places where such
activities take place.

2. In the year 2004, the Parliament repealed the Prevention of
   Terrorist Activities Act and simultaneously introduced certain
   provisions / chapters into ULP Act to curb terrorist activities. A
   schedule is also added containing a list of 'terrorist
   organisations', which expression is defined in clause (m) of
   Section 2. The expression 'terrorist act' is defined by clause (k).
   'Terrorist act' carries the meaning assigned to it in Section 15,
   which is introduced in the year 2004 by way of Chapter IV.
   Section 15, which defines a 'terrorist act', reads as follows:
   "15. _Terrorist act_ --- Whoever, with intent to threaten the
   unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or to strike terror
   in the people or any section of the people in India or in any
   foreign country, does any act by using bombs, dynamite or other
   explosive substances or inflammable substances or firearms or
   other lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other
   chemicals or by any other substances (whether biological or
   otherwise) of a hazardous nature, in such a manner as to cause,
   or likely to cause, death of, or injuries to any person or persons
   or loss of, or damage to, or destruction of, property or disruption
   of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community
   in India or in any foreign country or causes damage or
   destruction of any property or equipment used or intended to be
   used for the defence of India or in connection with any other
   purposes of the Government of India, any State Government or
   any of their agencies, or detains any person and threatens to kill
   or injure such person in order to compel the Government in India
   or the Government of a foreign country or any other person to do
   or abstain from doing any act, commits a terrorist act."

3. When analysed, the section yields the following ingredients:
   (i) whoever, with _intent_ to threaten the unity, integrity, security
   or sovereignty of India or to strike terror in the people or any
   section of the people in India _or_ in any foreign country, (ii) does
   any _act_ by using bombs and other explosives / inflammable
   substances, fire arms, etc., (iii) in such a manner as _to cause or
   likely to cause_ death or injuries to any person or persons or loss
   of or damage to or destruction of the property or disruption of
   any supplies or services essential to the life of the community of
   India or in any foreign country or causes damage or destruction
   of the property or equipment used or intended to be used for the
   defence of India or in connection with any other purposes of the
   Government of India, any State Government or any of their
   agencies or detains any person(s) and threatens to kill or injure
   such person in order to compel the Government of India or the
   Government of a foreign country or any other person to do or
   abstain from doing any act, (iv) commits a terrorist act. In short,
   the first portion deals with the intent, the second portion deals
   with the act and the third ingredient deals with the effect or likely
   effect. If all these three ingredients mentioned under (i) to (iii)
   are satisfied, it amounts to a 'terrorist act'. Section 16 provides
   punishment for terrorist act while Section 17 provides
   punishment for raising funds for the purpose of committing a
   terrorist act. A conspiracy towards the same objective is
   punishable under Section 18. Section 19 punishes those who
   voluntarily harbour or conceal or attempt to harbour or conceal
   any terrorist. Section 20 provides punishment for being a
   member of a terrorist gang or terrorist organisation. Section 21
   punishes any person holding proceeds of terrorism while Section
   22 provides punishment for threatening the witnesses. Section
   23 provides for enhanced penalties in certain situations
   mentioned therein.

4. Chapter V commencing with Section 24 provides for
   forfeiture of proceeds of terrorism. Section 25 specifies the
   powers of the investigating officer and designated authority and
   also provides for an appeal against an order of the designated
   authority. Section 26 empowers the Court also to forfeit the
   proceeds of terrorism in a matter that comes before it. Section
   27 prescribes the procedure to be followed before forfeiting the
   proceeds of terrorism while Section 28 provides an appeal
   against an order made under Section 26. Sections 29 to 34 are
   machinery provisions, which need not be detailed herein.

5. Chapter VI which has also been introduced by the 2004
   Amendment Act deals with terrorist associations. The Central
   Government is empowered, by an order published in he official
   gazette to add an organisation to the schedule or to remove an
   organisation therefrom and/or to amend the schedule in such
   other manner as it may think appropriate (535(1)). Sub-section
   (3) of Section 35 says that an organisation shall be deemed to be
   involved in terrorism if it commits or participates in acts of
   terrorism or prepares for terrorism or promotes or encourages
   terrorism or is otherwise involved in terrorism. Section 36
   provides for denotification of a terrorist organisation. This
   section provides for an application being made for removing an
   organisation from the schedule to the Act and the procedure to
   be followed thereon. Section 37 obligates the Central
   Government to constitute one or more review committees for the
   purposes of Section 36. Section 38 makes the membership of a
   terrorist organisation a punishable offence while Section 39
   punishes a person giving any kind of support to a terrorist
   organisation. Section 40 makes the raising of funds for terrorist
   organisation a punishable offence.

6. Chapter VII contains miscellaneous provisions. Section 41
   says that an organisation shall not be deemed to have ceased to
   exist by reason only of any formal act of dissolution or change of
   name but shall be deemed to continue so long as any actual
   combination for the purposes of such association continues
   between any members thereof. In other words, by mere change
   of name or by mere formal act of dissolution, a terrorist
   organisation does not cease to exist, so long as its members
   have the same objectives and purposes. Section 42 empowers
   the Central Government to delegate its powers under certain
   specific sections upon State Governments. Section 43 deals with
   the powers of investigating officers under the Act. Section 44
   deals with protection of witnesses. Section 45 says that no Court
   shall take cognizance of any offence under Chapters 4 and 6
   without the previous sanction of the Central Government or the
   State Government as the case may be. Section 46 makes the
   evidence collected through interception of communications
   admissible. Section 47 bars the jurisdiction of any civil court or
   other authority to question any proceedings taken or orders
   passed under the Act. Section 48 gives an overriding effect to
   the Act and the rules made thereunder over other enactments.

7. Section 49 is relevant and needs specific and a detailed
   mention. It provides protection of action taken under the Act in
   good faith. It reads as follows:

   >49. Protection of action taken in good faith --- No suit,
   >prosecution or other legal proceedings shall lie against ---
   > 
   >(a) the Central Government or a State Government or any
   >officer or authority of the Central Government or State
   >Government or District Magistrate or any officer authorized in
   >this behalf by the Government or the District Magistrate or any
   >other authority on whom powers have been conferred under this
   >Act, for anything which is _in good faith_ done or purported to be
   >done in pursuance of this Act or any rule or order made
   >thereunder; and
   > 
   >(b) any serving or retired member of the armed forces or para-
   >military forces in respect of any action taken or purported to be
   >taken by him in good faith, in the course of any operation
   >directed towards combating terrorism.

8. It is worthwhile to note that while no provision in the Act
   specifically refers to the deployment of any armed force or para
   military force for achieving any of the objectives of the Act,
   clause (b) of Section 49 expressly gives protection to any serving
   or retired member of the armed forces or para military forces in
   respect of any action taken or purported to be taken by him in
   good faith, "in the course of any operation directed towards
   combating terrorism". Now, it is a well-established presumption
   --- a presumption which is affirmed by innumerable decisions of
   the courts --- that the Parliament does not make any provision
   without a purpose. None of the provisions in an Act can be
   understood or construed as superfluous. If so, a question arises
   why did the Parliament introduce clause (b) of Section 49? Why
   did it think it necessary to provide a protection to "any serving or
   retired member of the armed forces or para military forces" in
   respect of any action taken in good faith "in the course of any
   operation" directed towards combating terrorism? In our
   considered opinion, this provision does contemplate, by
   necessary implication, use of armed forces/para military forces
   for combating terrorism and also contemplates the armed forces
   / para military forces conducting "operations" towards combating
   terrorism, This intent must be read in the context of the
   Schedule appended to the Act wherein there are specifically
   included quite a few organisations engaged in insurgency /
   militancy in the States of Assam, Manipur and Tripura. As a
   matter of fact, the Act makes it clear that the terrorist activity is
   not restricted to the activities of the organisations mentioned in
   the Schedule; it means any and every activity of the kind
   mentioned in Section 15 carried on by any person, organisation
   or gang. This section indicates that the Parliament did take note
   of the fact that in many cases it may be necessary to employ the
   armed forces or para military forces to combat terrorism and
   terrorist activities. Indeed, the Parliament must have taken note
   of the fact that armed forces and para-military forces were
   already engaged in such operations against the organisations
   listed in the Schedule and others engaging in similar activities. At
   the same time, it must be noted, the protection extended by
   Section 49 is not unconditional. Both the clauses in (a) and (b)
   qualify and restrict the protection only to acts done in good faith.
   The expression "good faith" is indeed used in the heading of the
   section, which circumstance also goes to emphasise the nature
   and extent of protection provided.

9. Section 50 is in the nature of saving clause, which says
   that nothing in this Act shall affect the jurisdiction exercisable by,
   or the procedure applicable to, any Court or other authority
   under any law relating to the navy, army or air force or other
   armed forces of the Union. Section 51 provides for impounding
   of passport and arm licence of persons proceeded under the Act.
   Section 52 confers the rule making power upon the Central
   Government. Section 53 provides for orders and rules made
   under the Act to be laid before both Houses of Parliament.

10. The schedule, which is referable to Section 2 (1) (m) and
    Section 35 of the Act, gives a list of "terrorist organizations". We
    may notice some of them, which are relevant for the purposes of
    this Committee. Serial Nos. 12 and 13 speak of United Liberation
    Front of Assam (ULFA) and National Democratic Front of
    Bodoland (NDFB), the organisations active in Assam. Serial
    Nos. 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 mention the organisations operating
    in Manipur. They are peoples Liberation Army (PLA), United
    National Liberation Front (UNLF), Peoples Revolutionary Party of
    Kangleipak (PREPAK), Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP),
    Kanglei Yaol Kanba Lup (KYKL) and Manipur Peoples Liberation
    Front (MPLF) respectively. Items 19 and 20 refer to All Tripura
    Tiger Force and National Liberation Front of Tripura respectively.
    All of them are designated as "terrorist organisations" within the
    meaning of Section 2(1)(m) and Section 35 of this Act. (For the
    present purposes it may not be necessary to mention the
    organisation mentioned under serial Nos.1 to 10 and 21 to 32.)

11. The specific language in which "terrorist act" is defined and
    the terrorist activity is sought to be fought and curbed by use of
    armed forces and para-military forces also, wherever necessary,
    coupled with the fact that several organisations in the States of
    Assam, Manipur and Tripura are expressly listed as "terrorist
    organizations", induces us to call the ULP Act a cognate
    enactment.
