/c Legal and Constitutional Aspects

/s CHAPTER-I

To meet the situation arising in certain parts of India on
account of the partition of the country in 1947, the Government
of India issued four Ordinances viz., the Bengal Disturbed Areas
(Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance, 1947 (Act 11 of
1947); the Assam Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed
Forces) Ordinance, 1947 (Act 14 of 1947); the East Punjab and
Delhi Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces)
Ordinance, 1947 (Act 17 of 1947); and the United Provinces
Disturbed Areas (Special Powers of Armed Forces) Ordinance,
1947 (Act 22 of 1947). These Ordinances were replaced by the
Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1948 being Act 3 of 1948. It
is not necessary for us to notice the provisions of this Act for the
reason that it was a temporary statute enacted for a period of
one year, though it continued till it was repealed by Act 36 of
1957.

2. The present Act was enacted by the Parliament in 1958 and
it was known initially as Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur)
Special Powers Act, 1958. The Act was preceded by an Ordinance
called Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers
Ordinance, 1958 promulgated by the President of India on 22-5-
1958. The Act applied to the entire State of Assam and the
Union Territory of Manipur. After the new States of Arunachal
Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland came into being,
the Act was appropriately adapted to apply to these States. The
Act has not been made applicable to any other State in the
country.

3. Some observations regarding the situation obtaining in the
   North-east may not be out of order before referring to the
   feedback received from each State.

4. The Committee feels that agitations such as those in
   Manipur and elsewhere are merely the symptoms of a malaise,
   which goes much deeper. The recurring phenomena of one
   agitation after another over various issues and the fact that
   public sentiments can be roused so easily and frequently to
   unleash unrest, confrontation and violence also points to deep-
   rooted causes which are often not addressed. Unless the core
   issues are tackled, any issue or non-issue may continue to trigger
   another upsurge or agitation.

5. The present ground realities need to be viewed in the
   context of the geo-political, socio-economic and ethnic factors as ...
   impasse.

6. As originally enacted, the power to declare an area to be a
   'disturbed area' was conferred only upon the State governments.
   By Act 7 of 1972, however, such a power was conferred
   concurrently upon the Central government. The reason for
   conferring such a power upon the Central government is stated in
   the 'Objects and Reasons' appended to the Bill. which reads thus:
   "The Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act,
   1958 empowers only the Governors of the States and the
   Administrators of the Union Territories to declare areas in the
   concerned State of Union Territory as 'disturbed'. Keeping in
   view the duty of the Union under Article 355 of the Constitution,
   inter alia, to protect every State against internal disturbance, it is
   considered desirable that the Central government should also
   have power to declare areas as 'disturbed', to enable its armed
   forces to exercise the special powers."

7. The Preamble to the Act, as amended, reads as follows:
   "An Act to enable certain special powers to be conferred upon
   members of the Armed Forces in disturbed areas in the State of
   Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram,
   Nagaland and Tripura."

Sub-section (2) of Section 1 the Act applies the Act to the
States mentioned in the preamble. Section 2 defines the
expressions 'Armed Forces' in clause (a) and 'disturbed areas' in
clause (b). They read as follows:

>(a) 'Armed Forces' means the military force and the air force
operating as land forces and includes any other armed force of
the Union so operating. (Thus the Armed Forces established and maintained by the Union also fall within this definition.)
(b) 'Disturbed area' means an area which is for the time being
declared by notification under Section 3 to be a disturbed area.

Clause (c) of Section 2 says that all other words and
expressions used in the Act but not defined, but defined in the Air
Force Act, 1950 or the Army Act, 1950 shall have the meanings
respectively assigned to them in those Acts.

8. Section 3 of the Act reads as follows:

>_Power to declare areas to be disturbed areas_. --- If, in relation
>to any State or Union Territory to which this Act extends, the
>Governor of that State or the Administrator of that Union
>Territory or the Central Government, in either case, is of the
>opinion that the whole or any part of such State or Union
>Territory, as the case may be, is in such a disturbed or dangerous
>condition that the use of armed forces in aid of the civil power is
>necessary, the Governor of that State or the Administrator of that
>Union Territory or the Central Government, as the case may be,
>may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare the whole or
>such part of such State or Union Territory to be a disturbed
>area.

9. Under this Section, if the Government of the State to which
   this Act applies _is of the opinion_, that whole or any part of such
   State is in such a disturbed or dangerous condition that the use
   of armed forces in aid of civil power is necessary, it may, by a
   notification published in the official gazette, declare the whole of
   the State or part of the State to be a 'disturbed area'. Such a
   power can also be exercised by the central government by virtue
   of the 1972 Amendment Act. This Section, however, does not
   specifically say either that the Governor may, after issuing a
   declaration, request the Union government to depute the armed
   forces nor does it say expressly that the central government
   may, on issuance of a notification under the Section, depute
   armed forces to the State to act in aid of the civil power.
   Probably, these steps were thought to be implicit in the situation.

10. Section 4 enumerates the special powers of the armed
    forces, which are deployed in a state or a part of the State to act
    in aid of civil power. The Section reads as follows:

    >_Special powers of the armed forces._ --- Any commissioned
    >officer, warrant officer, non-commissioned officer or any other
    >person of equivalent rank in the armed forces may, in a disturbed
    >area, ---
    >(a) if he is of opinion that it is necessary so to do for the
    >maintenance of public order, after giving such due warning as he
    >may consider necessary fire upon or otherwise use force, even to
    >the causing of death, against any person who is acting in
    >contravention of any law or order for the time being in force in
    >the disturbed area prohibiting the assembly of five or more
    >persons or the carrying of weapons or of things capable of being
    >used as weapons or of firearms, ammunition or explosive
    >substances;
    >(b) if he is of opinion that it is necessary so to do, destroy any
    >arms dump, prepared or fortified position or shelter from which
    >armed attacks are made or are likely to be made or are
    >attempted to be made, or any structure used as training camp for
    >armed volunteers or utilised as a hideout by armed gangs or
    >absconders wanted for any offence;
    >(C) arrest, without warrant, any person who has committed a
    >cognizable offence or against whom a reasonable suspicion exists
    >that he has committed or is about to commit a cognizable offence
    >and may use such force as may be necessary to effect the arrest;
    >(d) enter and search without warrant any premises to make
    >any such arrest as aforesaid or to recover any person believed to
    >be wrongfully restrained or confined or any property reasonably
    >suspected to be stolen property or any arms, ammunition or
    >explosive substances believed to be unlawfully kept in such
    >premises, and may for that purpose use such force as may be
    >necessary.

11. Under this Section, various powers are conferred upon any
    commissioned officer, warrant officer, non-commissioned officer
    or any other person of equivalent rank in the armed forces. Of 
    course, these powers are available only in an area notified as
    'disturbed area' under Section 3. The power conferred by clause
    (a), can be better appreciated, if its essential ingredients are
    separately set out:

    >(i) Where there is in force, in the disturbed area, a law or an
    >order prohibiting the assembly of five or more persons or the
    >carrying of weapons or of things capable of being used as
    >weapons or of fire arms, ammunition or explosive substances;
    >(ii) and a person is acting in contravention of any such law and
    >order,
    >(iii) any officer of the armed forces of the above named rank,
    >may, if he is of the opinion that it is necessary so to do for the
    >maintenance of public order, after giving such due warnings as
    >he may consider necessary, fire upon or otherwise use force even
    >to the causing of death of such person.

12. It is thus clear that according to clause (a) of Section 4, the
    power to fire upon the persons is not unregulated or absolute.
    Such a power comes into play only where the ingredients
    mentioned under (i) and (ii) are satisfied and furthermore where
    such officer of the armed forces is of the opinion that it is
    necessary to fire upon such person(s) or to otherwise use force
    against such person(s) for the purpose of maintaining public
    order. It goes without saying that the 'opinion' must be formed
    honestly and fairly.

13. Clause (b) is of course independent of clause (a). The
    requirement of a law or an order prohibiting the assembly of five
    or more persons referred to in clause (a) is not necessary for
    acting under clause (b). Under this clause, the officer of the
    armed forces is empowered to destroy any arms dump or other
    fortified position / shelter or any structure mentioned in the
    clause, if he is of the opinion that "it is necessary so to do".
    Though the clause expressly does not say, it necessarily means
    that such a course or action is necessary for effectively
    discharging their duties.

    Clause (c) confers upon an officer of the armed forces the
    power to arrest any person, without warrant, who has committed
    or who is reasonably suspected to have committed a cognizable
    offence. Such power of arrest can also be exercised to prevent a
    person who is 'about to commit a cognizable offence'. This power
    is comparable to the power conferred upon a police officer by
    clause (a) of Section 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. For
    effecting such arrest, the officer of the armed forces is also
    empowered to use such force as may be necessary. This power,
    however, is circumscribed by Section 5, which says that any
    person arrested and taken into custody under this Act shall be
    made over to the officer-in-charge of the nearest police station
    "with the least possible delay, together with a report of the
    circumstances occasioning the arrest". The words "with the
    least possible delay" in Section 5 appear to have raised a doubt
    in the minds of some persons that this may even exceed 24
    hours. We do not think there is any basis for such a doubt
    inasmuch as clause (2) of Article 22 of the Constitution of
    India does cast such a duty. Indeed, the said clause in the
    Constitution _confers a right upon the person arrested and
    detained in custody_ to be produced before the nearest Magistrate
    within a period of 24 hours of such arrest excluding the time
    necessary for journey from the place of arrest to the court of
    Magistrate and further declares that such person shall not be
    detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority
    of a Magistrate. The constitutional right so conferred upon the
    person arrested is available whether the arrest is made by an
    officer of the armed forces or by the police. It is, therefore, clear
    beyond doubt that a person arrested under clause (c) of Section
    has to be produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours excluding
    the time taken for journey from the place of arrest to the court of
    Magistrate. To put it more clearly, the person arrested under
    clause (c) of Section 4 has to be produced before a Magistrate
    within 24 hours of his arrest (excluding the time taken for
    journey) and it is within this period that the officer of the armed
    rces who made the arrest shall hand over the person to the
    police and the police shall produce the person before the
    Magistrate. In this connection, it would be appropriate to notice
    Article 33 of the Constitution of India, which, as amended in
    1984, reads as follows:

    >_Power of Parliament to modify the rights conferred by this part
    >in their application to Forces, etc_ ---
    >Parliament may, by law, determine to what extent any of the
    >rights conferred by this Part shall, in their application to, -
    >(a) _the members of the Armed forces_; or.
    >(b) _the members of the forces charged with the maintenance
    >of public order_; or
    >(c) persons employed in any bureau or other organisation
    >established by the State for purposes of intelligence or counter-
    >intelligence; or
    >(d) persons employed in, or in connection with, the
    >telecommunication system set up for the purpose of any Force,
    >bureau or organisation referred to in clauses (a) to (c); be
    >restricted or abrogated so as to ensure the proper discharge of
    >their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them.

14. Under this clause, the Parliament is empowered to make a
law determining "to what extent any of the right conferred by this
Part shall, in their application to (a) the members of the Armed
forces or (b) the members of the armed forces charged with the
maintenance of public order", be restricted or abrogated so as to
ensure the proper discharge of their duties. But it is not brought
to our notice that the Parliament has chosen to make any such
law modifying or qualifying the right conferred by clause (2) of
Article 22 upon the person arrested where he is arrested by the
members of the Armed forces or of the Forces charged with the
maintenance of public order. It is, therefore, clear that the right
conferred by clause (2) of Article 22 upon a person arrested to be
produced before the Magistrate within 24 hours (excluding the
time for journey) remains untrammeled and unaffected and has,
therefore, to be obeyed.

15. Clause (d) of Section 4 of the Act confers upon the officer
    of the Armed Forces (mentioned in the Section) the power to
    enter and search without warrant to make an arrest under clause
    (c) of Section 4 or to recover person wrongfully detained or to
    recover any property suspected to be stolen property or any
    arms, ammunition, etc., kept unlawfully. He is also empowered
    to use such force as is necessary for the said purpose.

16. Section 6 confers a protection upon the persons acting
    under the Act. No suit, prosecution or other legal proceeding can
    be instituted against such person "in respect of anything done or
    purported to be done in exercise of the powers conferred by this
    Act", except with the previous sanction of the central
    government.
