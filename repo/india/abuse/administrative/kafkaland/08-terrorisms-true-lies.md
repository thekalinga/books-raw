## Terrorismâ€™s True Lies

There is a fairly typical kind of story that appears in the media after every bomb blast. It is accompanied by a visual spread which graphically 'joins the dots' in the supposed Indian terror network, the Indian Mujahideen. At the centre of this graphic is Atif Amin, the youth slain in the 'encounter' at Batla House, and various arrows shoot out towards photos of 'Bhatkal brothers', mufti Abu Bashar, an elusive Abdul Subhan Qureshi 'Tauqeer' and many others. The cast changes marginally, and the plot moves between Kerala, Bhatkal in Karnataka, Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh, Ujjain and Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh with detours into Hyderabad, Maharashtra and Gujarat.

SIMI, IM, Lashkar, HuJI morph seamlessly into each other in this story of homegrown terror. Speaking at the launch of a book, titled unimaginatively, _Indian Mujahideen: The Enemy Within_ (2011), to an audience made up largely of the elite of the security and intelligence establishment, the then Home Minister Chidambaram stressed that we could no longer rest easy in the assumption that the source of terror was across the border --- we must wake up to the home grown variety that SIMI and IM represent. The author, described glowingly by Arun Jaitley, the other speaker at the book launch as a "foot-soldier", does a stunning regurgitation of chargesheets and confessions --- the latter not even admissible in court. This book was launched around the time two prominent magazines chose to do cover stories on the Indian Mujahideen[^47] (based again on chargesheets and confessions and little else), weeks after the blasts in Mumbai --- and barely a month after the investigative agencies were claiming successes in busting modules and making arrests. The month of June saw several arrests in Madhya Pradesh --- even a shootout in Ratlam in which ostensibly high-ranking IM operatives were arrested --- and the Gujarat police claimed the trophy of alleged IM man, Danish Reyaz.

Does the IM exist? If it does, what precisely is it? In all honesty, it's not a question that is easy to answer --- given that the only proofs of the existence of the organization have been the e-mails received after the 2008 blasts, and the State dossiers. The arrest of Yasin Bhatkal in August 2013 unleashed another round of fierce and frenzied reporting --- with his disclosures and confessions claiming the omnipresent IM hand everywhere, making headlines each day. What can be done --- and ought to be done by journalists who love the prefix 'investigative' --- is to subject the police and anti-terror agencies claims to some scrutiny, especially so after Malegaon and Mecca Masjid revelations. Such an exercise reveals another pattern altogether: this is the web spun by agencies of counterterrorism, whose threads connect between Kashmir and Delhi _Special Cell_, the Gujarat ATS and the Uttar Pradesh ATS, and various police departments in between.

Investigating agencies are predisposed towards 'picking up' suspects and accused far ahead of the arrest shown in FIRS, chargesheets and media conferences and leaks. The phrase 'picking up' reflects our unique ability to sanitize and blunt the jagged edges of investigative process to which illegal detention is crucial --- just as 'encounters' are a glamorous and Bollywoody euphemism for cold-blooded executions. This is now so routine that it's lost all novelty. Take the case of Qamar and Irshad Ali, kidnapped by the _Special Cell_ of the Delhi Police in December 2005 and then declared arrested while alighting from a Kashmir Roadways bus in February 2006, full two months after they were disappeared. It turned out in the end that Qamar and Irshad were not operatives of _Al Badar_, as the _Special Cell_ claimed, but IB informers who fell out of favour when they refused to carry out the directives of their bosses.

Or consider the case of Md. Sarwar, one of the key accused in the Jaipur blasts of 2008. A B.Tech from Integral University, Lucknow, Sarwar arrived in mid January 2009 to work in the Ujjain branch of a Hyderabad-based IT company. On the evening of 19 January 2009, four days after he had joined work, when he stepped out of the premises, he did not return. When he failed to return the next day, his office filed a missing persons complaint at the Neelganga police station, Ujjain, and were told that in all probability the police had taken him away. On 22 January, two days after a missing persons complaint had been filed in Ujjain, Sarwar's family received a call from Lucknow ATS that their son had been arrested from Lucknow in connection with Jaipur blasts.

Abu Bashar, a cleric from Beenapara, Azamgarh, charged with indoctrinating young IM recruits to wage jihad, was picked up in full public view from his home on 14 August 2008 by half a dozen men in plainclothes, following which his father rushed to the Sarai Meer police station, fearing abduction. He was rebuffed and no effort was made by the local police to trace the missing mufti. The local papers though were agog with this story and some quoted the Superintendent of Police, Azamgarh as saying that Bashar was a SIMI activist and had been arrested by the ATS. These stories appeared on the 15 August --- surprise then that the ATS announced on 16 August that they had arrested Abu Bashar from outside the Charbagh railway station in Lucknow earlier that day at dawn.

Truth didn't hurt anybody, believes the UP ATS, as did its predecessor, the Special Task Force (STF). On 12 December 2007, after serial blasts rocked courts in Faizabad, Barabanki and Lucknow on 23 November, the STF abducted Tariq, a traditional practitioner of medicine who was on his way to an international _ijtema_ (religious gathering) being organized by Tablighi Jamaat. Hakim Tariq was in charge of the health camp at the _ijtema_. While crossing the Mahmoodpur checkpost in Rani ki Sarai (Azamgarh), his bike was waylaid by a group of men aboard a white jeep. When others present on the spot opposed what they perceived to be a kidnapping, they were told that it was a family dispute and Tariq was only being returned home, which he had left after a tiff. Between 13 and 20 December, a missing persons complaint was filed, an application moved in the court of the chief judicial magistrate; the District Information Office was asked if it had any information about the whereabouts of Tariq; local residents organized protests and demonstrations demanding that Tariq be produced before the court. The news of Tariq's disappearance was widely covered in the local press.

On 16 December, Khalid Mujahid, a recently married teacher at a local girls' madrasa, was sent out to buy _neel_ (indigo). But when he reached the market, the savouries of Munnu Chaat Bhandar tempted him. As he stood there, in the middle of the market bustle, eating chaat, at about 6.15 pm, he was pushed into a vehicle at gunpoint. His uncle, Md. Zaheer Alam who was on his way from Rai Bareilly to Allahabad, when informed of the abduction of his nephew rang up the SHO at Madiayun police station, who claimed to be away from the police station. The uncle sent faxes to the District Magistrate of Jaunpur, Chief Minister, the Governer as well as the Home Secretary. On 21 December, a news item in the local newspapers appeared, which quoted Zaheer Falahi saying that he suspected his nephew had been killed in a fake encounter.

But this could as well have been happening on another planet, for this is how the FIR lodged in Barabanki Kotwali records the arrest of Tariq:

>Today, on 22.12.2007, secret information was received from an informer that a suspicious character with links to a terrorist organization, bearing deadly weapons and explosives, will be arriving at the Barabanki railway station at 6.30 am... around 6.15 am two persons got off from a rickshaw outside the station and began to wait for someone. The informer from a distance pointed towards one of these two men holding a bag. Suddenly these two picked up their bags and started walking quickly from the railway station towards the main road. We introduced ourselves and asked them to stop. They tried to open their bags. Knowing full well that their bags were laden with explosives, the members of the team [names] risked their lives in fulfilling the call of duty and finally caught them after some struggle.[^48]

Bravo.

However, confronted by mounting public pressure, the then Chief Minister Mayawati ordered a probe into the allegations surrounding the arrest of hakim Tariq and Khalid Mujahid. The inquiry panel headed by Judge RD Nimesh that began work in 2008 was given a time frame of six months. It took the Commission more than four years to conclude hearings and submit its findings. The delay was partly on account of the long disappearances of the public prosecutor, and partly because the ATS was reluctant to participate in the hearings. In 2011, in the course of the Commission's proceedings, Sajadur Rehman, one of the co-accused in the Lucknow blast case was discharged for absolute lack of evidence.

Having examined 92 affidavits, 47 submitted by the state and 25 by the defence, the Nimesh Commission affirmed the account of Qasmi and Mujahid that they had been abducted by the STF. It concluded that their involvement in any incident on the morning of 22 December was doubtful, and indeed directed that those officers and personnel who had framed, illegally detained and tortured the duo be identified and prosecuted.[^49]

Less than an year after the Commission submitted its report, Khalid Mujahid died of "sudden medical complications" while returning to Lucknow prison, having made his appearance in the court in Barabanki. Mujahid had no history of illnesses.

Don't be surprised by the fact that ten alleged operatives arrested in a midnight raid in Gulmohar colony in Khandwa on 13 June 2011 were actually _picked up_ (again that dreaded phrase) between 10 and 12 June by the police from their homes in Ganesh ganj and Indira Nagar, ostensibly for questioning. They were never returned home --- the police dismissed the families' pleas to return the boys, even feigned ignorance about their whereabouts. At least two families, that of Khaleel and Amjad, moved applications in court that their sons had been detained by the police without any charge and the police had failed to produce them before court within 24 hours as they are bound to.[^50] In response to these applications, the City Kotwali police submitted to the Chief Judicial Magistrate that though Khaleel had been called to the police station on 10 June, he had not been detained thereafter. The police also claimed that Amjad had not been found at all despite their investigations and therefore could not be questioned. These responses are dated 13 June.[^51] On 15 June however, news headlines announced that the local police had arrested 10 SIMI activists from Aquil Khilji's house in Gulmohar Colony. The police had busted a meeting on the night of 13 June when they were "reviewing their future activities" and "planning a terror strike".[^52] IG (ATS) Vipin Maheshwari told _Times of India_ that the police recovered "four pistols, 12 live cartridges, SIMI literature, two dozen CDs and phones."[^53] Only the most senseless and the foolhardiest would have convened a meeting days after being questioned by the police. The CJM before whom the accused were produced noted in his order granting the police remand that there were blue bruises on the body of Khaleel.[^54]

It is interesting how counterterror agencies are drawn towards bus and railway stations, almost as moths to light. Most arrests are shown as taking place in and around bus stations and railway stations. Irshad and Qamar were shown alighting from a Kashmir Roadways bus at Mukarba Chowk, North Delhi --- it turned out that the bus tickets placed as evidence before the court were of a day later than the purported date of arrest. In November 2009, Additional Sessions Judge Dharmesh Sharma noted that the _Special Cell_'s story of having nabbed Gulzar Ahmed Ganai and Md. Amin Hajam --- 'dreaded terrorists' of the LeT --- at Mahipalpur Chowk at 9.15 pm when they were de-boarding bus number DLIPB 0249 (route number 729) fell flat in view of the testimonies of the bus conductor and owner that the said bus did not ply at all in the evening of 10 December 2006, the supposed date of the arrest.

Bus stations and rail stations are significant to most plots of the investigative agencies as they are the sites where the accused are trying to pass on "arms and explosives" to someone leaving town or arriving from out of town. So even while according to the police story, invariably, their secret informer, _mukhbir_, tells them of a rendezvous terrorists have fixed to pass on arms, explosives and such like to their aides, the police shows little keenness in apprehending the aides whom the terrorist was supposedly standing in wait for; or indeed in tracing the explosives and cash seized from the accused. Delighted at having nabbed a 'kingpin' and recovered suitable caches of money, detonators etc. --- the investigators then get busy extolling their commitment to duty in press conferences. In some cases at least, courts have shown that money and arms were planted on the accused. The _Special Cell_ alleged in the FIR that a search of the accused Gulzar Ganai and Md. Hajam yielded 15 slabs of oil-based explosives, Rupees six lakh in cash and two non-electric detonators. The police diary, however, when perused by Judge Sharma revealed no such information about the recoveries. This, and the contradicting testimonies about the recoveries in the court by the members of the _Special Cell_, drove the judge to wonder if it was a "human mistake or something else. The moot point is: were the mistakes pointed out above bonafide or mistakes committed while attempting to cook up the entire story?"

Similarly, the CBI too, while investigating the Qamar and Irshad Ali case, noted that the _Special Cell_ remained unperturbed by the recoveries of explosives and cash, not deigning to track the arms trail. This suggested that these were no recoveries but plants. The question, then, is where are these recoveries procured from? Who is paying for the lakhs being shown as recovered, where does the trail of RDX and arms and ammunition lead to?

The Home Minister, speaking at the same programme alluded to above, complained that Indians' idea of counter terror ops, influenced by cinema, was of someone chopping off bomb wires with nervous, sweaty hands, just moments before the bomb is to explode. But it appears the Indian public aren't the only ones raised on a diet of Bollywood masala --- the security establishment, too, is a firm believer in the value of theatre. Why else would they transform illegal detentions and abductions into dramatic arrests and heroic encounters with terrorists? One understands that there can be false leads and even faulty investigations --- but to assert that a blast case has been solved, or a terror module busted on the basis of forced disclosures and custodial confessions is a lapse of another order.

So then how does one believe the _Special Cell_ which has been proven to plant evidence on innocents --- proven guilty not by civil rights groups, but by the CBI and courts --- implicating them in false cases as operatives of Al Badar, LeT or agents of ISI, when it now says that the young men, one of them practically a boy, killed in the Batla House encounter were key figures in the IM hierarchy.

Activists and legal rights workers often advise those vulnerable to such arrests and illegal detentions that in the event someone is taken away unlawfully without identification or papers, a missing persons complaint should be lodged at the earliest. That copies should be sent to as many State institutions as possible to record the period of illegal detention. Within a couple of hours of Abu Bashar being taken away, his younger brother sent an email to the Supreme Court describing frantically how some men posing as guests came to their Beenapra home and took away Bashar. He said that he feared that the visitors belonged to the UP STF. Bashar's brother may have hoped that this email would be converted into a _writ_ of _habeas corpus_ (application demanding the detained person is produced before court for determining the validity of detention). Instead, the supreme court of justice replied more than a month later through the Assistant Registrar of its PIL Cell that "no action can be taken on your petition as the subject matter of your Email does not cover [sic] under any of the guidelines prescribed to deal with PIL matters. You may, if so advised, approach the appropriate forum for the desired relief, as per law."[^55]

Bashar's father not only reported his missing son to the police station, but he also wrote to the whole range of offices available in our democracy, including the National Human Rights Commission. To the NHRC, he wrote not only of the unlawful taking away of his son, but also of the apathy of the local police and the abuse and violence by the ATS whilst it conducted a raid in his house. What did the NHRC do? Issue notice to the ATS? Seek a response from the Commissioner of Police? No, it simply redirected the complaint to the SSP, Azamgarh, asking the complaint to be disposed "at your end". End of matter.

And then there are inquiry commissions. Like the Nimesh Commission, which was tabled in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly only after the custodial death of Khalid Mujahid --- and after mass uproar over his death.[^56] As a rule, governments prefer not to table these reports, believing firmly in the credo that time heals all. This is precisely the fate of Advocate Ravi Chander Report[^adv-ravi-report] examining the allegations of torture and forced confessions in the Mecca Masjid blasts and the Bhaskar Rao Commission looking into the police firing on those protesting the blast in the mosque. In 2010, responding to a question raised on the floor of the Andhra Pradesh Assembly, the incumbent Chief Minister Kiran Reddy insisted that he would apologize in the Assembly if the inquiry reports corroborate the accusations of torture.[^57] Only he wouldn't table the reports so we know. There is another approach too - brazenly ignore all calls for impartial inquiry and hide behind an effete NHRC which submits its report on an encounter killing on the basis of police statements, which is what happened in the Batla House case.

If stories about 'home grown terror' are to be reported solely on the basis of confessions, disclosures, interrogation reports, and opinions of so-called security experts, then no doubt there will emerge the "picture of a shadowy, sinister outfit of brainwashed young men", about whom journalists can write simultaneously without a trace of irony that these youth are so socially integrated as to be indistinguishable from any other boys their age --- as well as driven by "alienation from the Indian society". There is no precise count of how many are arrested, under trial or convicted in terror related cases. But we can be certain that the assertion glibly bandied around that this new breed of terror suspects are doctors, engineers, 'techies', college educated and professionals, does not correspond to reality. In Hyderabad, auto mechanics and drivers were picked up; in Uttar Pradesh, a mufti among others, poor daily wagers and construction workers have been arrested in Madhya Pradesh.

Even the so-called IT stories are really stories of struggle and often the first generation breaking into higher education and professions. Sarwar, son of a Mathematics teacher, known to all as Master Saab of Chandpatti (Azamgarh), was sent for IIT coaching to Benaras but when he could not clear JEE in two attempts, he joined Integral University in Lucknow. "He always stood first", his mother recalls as she caresses the file that holds his degrees and testimonials. Sarwar wanted to pursue M.Tech but they lacked the resources to fund his studies. "We were ready to sell the farm land", his father says, "but Sarwar wouldn't let me". Instead, he decided to work and enroll in M.Tech as a private student. "We were so happy when he got the job. We thought our days would change now." Sarwar's mother lets out a loud wail: "if only I had known, I wouldn't have let him out of my sight. We would have eaten meagrely, but would not have sent him to earn in another city."[^58]

Piece together the story of Ranchi's Danish 'Reyaz' from the interrogation reports, which surfaced in major newspapers and you will see a cunning software engineer operating multiple emails, plotting and planning kidnappings for ransom and bank robberies to raise funds for a tattered IM organization.[^59]

Like many of his generation, IT had seduced Danish too. Completing his BA (Hons.) in Geography, Danish enrolled at the Indian Institute of Hardware technology, one of those many private colleges that sell dreams of social mobility to young men like Danish. Financial constraints forced him to drop out of the last year of his course, sending him instead to Mumbai, that waiting post en route to Middle East. He lodged with an Urdu bookshop owner --- also named Danish Reyaz --- in Meera Road, in the time that he looked for employment in the Gulf. Without his certificate from the IT institute, he remained singularly unsuccessful. And in the manner of many fickle minded, unlucky and unemployed young men, had to return to Ranchi now to complete his course. He completed it in 2007. For a while repairing computers in Ranchi, Danish left for Hyderabad in 2008, in the hope of a white collar job, comforted by the presence of other young men from Baryatu, Ranchi's Muslim neighbourhood, who now lived and worked in the city. When the crime branch came to his family home in November--December 2008 (his brother could not recall the exact dates), he was already in Hyderabad, and dismissed the visit as a case of mistaken identity --- perhaps a confusion of names. His landlord Danish Reyaz had been picked up briefly after the Mumbai train blasts by the ATS, but never charged.

Danish's name first surfaced publicly, along with that of his neighbour and friend Manzar Imam, in local newspapers in Ranchi on 15 December 2010. "Two among IM operatives hail from Baryatu" was the general tenor of headlines.[^60] The same day, his brother saw his photograph being flashed on a news channel. Visits by media and the local crime branch were followed by a few months of peace. In April 2011, a team of NIA men visited Baryatu. "They were South Indian men who first posed as personnel of the passport Office", recalled his brother who was home when the team arrived. They left the number of the DSP, NIA, in Hyderabad, asking for Danish to contact him.

The private correspondence between Danish (D) and his brother 'R' from those days reveals another man altogether: a young, unsure and vulnerable Danish --- hardly the crafty organizer of terror attacks that he was portrayed to be.[^61]

>D: Then he told his assistant to take me out for tea--coffee.

This conversation, above all tells us two things: first, the belief of the brothers that telling the truth would protect them.

In the end though their faith proved to be misplaced. Barely two weeks after Danish visited the NIA office in Hyderabad to offer himself for questioning, he was shown arrested from the Vadodara railway station by Gujarat ATS for involvement in Gujarat blasts of 2008.

And second, it tells us how these imaginings of terror accused being cosmopolitan IT prodigals are quite hollow. Here is a young man who worked months without an appointment letter, without a salary slip --- and without a salary --- now worrying how the free labour extracted by an exploitative market has obliterated his legal existence, leaving him with no proof about his activities in those months. "But at least he [the former employer] can give witness that he employed you," asks the elder brother tentatively. But they both know the answer to that. It's unlikely.

It is an irony --- surely an unintended one, that while these suspects are expected to recall their lives, as though in a flashback, with precise proof, no less, of every single day, the rest of the public which consumes the stories of their arrests is hoped to be in possession of very short memories.

In fact, that's what the Indian investigating agencies depend on. They live in the hope that their claims of busting terror modules will not be questioned --- that their methods will be condoned and when the confessions they manufacture through torture of suspects militate against evidence and common sense, all will be forgotten. And so the next cycle will begin --- on a clean slate, as if nothing happened. New suspects can always be rounded up --- abducted even --- and paraded sensationally as masterminds and operatives.

It falls on us then, to keep stoking the fire of memories --- not for breast-beating, but to ensure the end of impunity.
