## The Life and Death of Gulam Yazdani

There are two ways in which to recreate the short life of Gulam Yazdani, or Naveed as he was called at home. The first relies on IB dossiers, interrogation reports and news reports based on the first two. In this narrative, Yazdani appears as an engineering student who turned to a life of terrorism and met his well-deserved end at the hands of the police in 2006. A native of Nalgonda, Yazdani was said to have been among the 14 men from the state who were recruited to be trained by the Lashkar in Pakistan after the Gujarat riots. Alleged mastermind of the Dilsukhnagar Saibaba temple blast in 2002, Haren Pandya murder in 2003 and suicide attack on STF Headquarters in Hyderabad in 2005, the bombing of Delhi Patna Shramjeevi Express at Jaunpur in 2005, Yazdani quickly rose to head the Lashkar's South India operation and was among the most wanted men on the Andhra Pradesh police list. He had also allegedly hatched a plan to blow up a Ganesh temple near Secunderabad railway station.[^25]

And then there is a more complex plot. Leave for the moment, these secret documents and look at the court records. In late 1999, Manik Prabhu Medical Stores, owned by a RSS worker, witnessed a shootout, leaving the owner's brother, Devender, dead. An FIR was lodged in the Saidabad police station.[^26] The New Year brought the Task Force to Gulam Yazdani's house. He was taken away but not produced before a magistrate. Precisely a month after Yazdani had been disappeared, he was formally arrested by the Saidabad police.

The investigation was transferred to CID in the month of May. The new agency booked a completely different set of accused --- among them, Syed Maqbool, in the news following the Dilsukhnagar blasts of 2013, for revealing that the area was on the target of terrorists.[^27]

In the period when Yazdani was in the custody of Task Force, two more cases were slapped against him: in the first, which was also transferred to the CID, Yazdani was charged with conspiracy and waging war against the nation; in the second, lodged just a day before he was produced in court, the police showed recoveries of detonators and pistols, and booked him under Arms Act and Explosive Substances Act.[^28] Released on bail, Yazdani was ultimately discharged from the Devender murder case and acquitted in the other two cases.

It is not clear how Yazdani came to be called the architect of the Haren Pandya murder but in circles whose denizens go by the label of 'security experts', this has become an article of faith. Yazdani, in fact, is not named an accused in the Haren Pandya murder case.

In the years following the 2002 Gujarat pogrom, the cult of the _Hindu hriday samrat_ (Emperor of Hindu hearts) was being carefully crafted. The numerous conspiracies 'detected' against Narendra Modi were crucial in fashioning the principal Hindutva icon and cementing the loyalties of his followers.

This was the period when police and investigating agencies in Gujarat claimed to have foiled a series of potential assassination attempts on Narendra Modi by liquidating 'terrorists'.[^29] Registry of POTA cases also surged: all those booked under POTA were Muslims accused of either plotting to kill BJP leaders or conspiring to terrorize Hindus of Gujarat.[^30]

The most gargantuan of these was the _Gujarat ISI Conspiracy Case_, more popularly known as the _DCB 6 case_, registered in April 2003, a month after Haren Pandya was killed. It had a mammoth list of over 80 accused --- a list which kept swelling well after the chargesheets had been filed, and POTA had been repealed.[^31] Yazdani was at home when news of Hyderabad boys being herded to Gujarat in the _DCB 6 case_ started appearing. Similar conspiracy cases were filed in Andhra against all those implicated in the _DCB 6_. Two cases in Nalgonda district were registered against Yazdani where he was declared 'absconding accused'.[^32] One evening, Yazdani did not return home. About fifteen days later, his father, the old Gulam Mustafa, received a call from him. Yazdani said he had fled to escape being ensnared in yet another case. He refused to divulge his location for fear that he would be arrested.

"I never saw my brother after that", Gulam Rabbani tells me over phone, "We only saw his dead body."

We do not know what he did in those intervening years. How he lived, where he lived. We will never know perhaps. The intelligence reports say he rose to prominence in the Lashkar ranks, planning, for example, the suicide attack on STF headquarters in Hyderabad. Did he? A man with backpack walked into the deserted STF headquarters --- Dussehra eve keeping most STF personnel away from office --- and blew himself up. His severed head and torso were recovered from outside the office. How he was identified as Mohtasin Bilal, a Bangladeshi national, carrying out the HuJI-B's first such operation,[^33] is itself interesting. From the charred debris of this human bomb, investigators recovered a suicide note,[^34] and a rubber slipper with a tell-all price tag that read 'Taka 100'.[^35]

These clues, salvaged extraordinarily from the burnt body disclosed to the investigators his identity!

"Two and half month's later, on December 27, 2005," we learn, "three HuJI-B militants involved in the Hyderabad attack were arrested by the _Special Cell_ of the Delhi police."[^36] Less than two weeks later, Deputy NSA Vijay Nambiar and NSCS Additional Secretary SD Pradhan met US' Deputy Chief of Mission in Delhi, Robert Blake to "pledge to seek the NSA's approval for greater intelligence sharing on terrorism threats within India." The discussion fixated on terror threats in the South. Blake in his confidential cable dispatch that day wrote:

>Pradhan also noted that the terrorists themselves are different and more adaptable. For example, 'Arshad,' who was arrested on December 18 in connection with the October 12 suicide attack on the Hyderabad Police Special Task Force office, was a police informer who benefited from a police security escort.[^37]

Interrogation reports made their way into expert commentary and created mounting evidence of Yazdani's guilt:

>Previously in August 2005, police had arrested Mohammad Ibrahim, a resident of Hyderabad, who revealed details of his travels in Bangladesh in 2004, his meetings with Ghulam Yazdani, the person involved in the Hiren Pandya murder in Gujarat on March 23, 2003, and his encounters with several HuJI terrorists from India and Pakistan. Four months before his arrest, in April 2005, Ibrahim had been sent to Karachi on a Bangladeshi passport, from where he was taken to an ISI camp in Balochistan.[^38]

Mohammad Ibrahim had been arrested on charges of conspiracy and sedition.[^39] In November 2005, Yazdani's brother, then a first year student of MCA at Osmania University PG College at Saidabad, was arrested in the case, charged with financially supporting Mohammad Ibrahim in his terrorist activities. He learnt later that he had been declared an 'absconder' even as he was attending classes at his college. In 2009, the First Additional Metropolitan Magistrate acquitted both Ibrahim and Yazdani's brother of all charges, as the prosecution could bring forth no evidence to substantiate the charges.[^40] Meanwhile, however, Gulam Rabbani's arrest added to the legend of the "dreaded absconder" Yazdani.[^41]

Yazdani's father's impassioned plea to his son to return home in January 2006 at the office of the then ACP Rajiv Trivedi was widely reported in the press. In the following month, Gulam Mustafa received a call from Trivedi. He enquired about Yazdani's physical features and identification marks, and very specifically, if he spoke haltingly. When Mustafa confirmed this, he was advised to forget about Yazdani and focus on the other sons. Trivedi's words, says the family, appeared ominous to them even then. On the evening of 7 March, three bombs exploded in Varanasi. The next morning, news agencies flashed the encounter killing of Yazdani and another man at the hands of the _Special Cell_ of the Delhi Police. "Lashkar terrorists" had been gunned down in the early hours of the morning in Bawana, the last outpost of Delhi.[^42]

This is how a Delhi Police press release announcing gallantry awards for the architect of the encounter described the encounter:

>Information was received that 2 LeT militants namely Ghulam Yezdani and Kajol would be arriving at Alipur Narela Road, Holambi Kalan T Point on 8.3.06. Police team headed by ACP Sanjeev Kumar Yadav along with Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma reached Alipur Narela Road and took positions at the strategic points. When terrorists reached the spot, ACP Sanjeev Yadav and Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma disclosed the identity of the police team and asked the militants to surrender. Both the militants were later on identified as Ghulam Yazdani @ Naved ... Ahsan Ullah Hasan @ Kabab Mohd @ Shahbaz Mohd @ Sajid Mehmood @ Shumon @ Jamil @ Ahmed @ Kajol r/o Chorangi Mor, Jheelchuli, Faridpur, Bangladesh. The militants did not pay to the heed and started firing at the approaching police party. ACP Sanjeev Yadav without caring for their life, faced hail of bullets fired by terrorist Ahsan Ullah Hasan @ Kajol and gave chase to him. The militant was constantly and indiscriminately firing towards him. Unfazed and undeterred Sh. Sanjeev Kumar Yadav in self defence and in order to apprehend the militants returned fire and shot dead Kajol. Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma on the other hand was facing indiscriminate firing from other militant Yezdani who had taken position behind a wall in the field. Inspector Sharma crawled on the road without caring for bodily injuries and took position so that the militant could not take the benefit of boundary wall. During exchange of fire the militant was shot dead.
> 
>Recognizing gallant act, ACP Sanjeev Kumar Yadav has been conferred President Police Medal for Gallantry while Late Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma has been awarded 1^st^ Bar to President's Police Medal for Gallantry. (sic)[^43]

This sparse prose is the template for almost all encounter killings in Delhi. Only the names of the victims change.

The family says that the body bore marks of torture, there were deep holes as though he had been drilled into and the head was misshapen. In the absence of a post mortem report, and the reluctance of the Delhi Police to hand over Yazdani's body to the family, despite a High Court order directing them to do so, is there any reason to disbelieve them?[^44]

Let us return briefly to Syed Maqbool. A small news item, which has not rivaled the popularity of his interrogation report leaked by Delhi Police, quotes 'sources' to say that Maqbool had become a police informant after his acquittal in the Devender murder case, and that his arrest was a consequence of rivalry between Delhi Police and Maharshtra ATS.[^45] Recall also Pradhan's frank admission to the US Deputy Chief of Mission that the accused in the STF attack was a police informer. Did persistent implication in terror cases push Yazdani to seek refuge with groups he was accused of being associated with? Did the police force him to turn informer for them? Was Yazdani used cynically by agencies and then disposed off when it suited them? Was he already in the custody of one agency or another when the telephone call was made to his father? These are not answers likely to emerge from the dossiers of the IB, reproduced endlessly till they acquire the sanctity of truth.

In this opaque netherland of terrorism--counterterrorism, it is not just loyalties that change side, but entire sides which overturn and mirror each other in grotesque ways. The good guys battling the evil ones is a fantasy manufactured by think tanks and the experts industry. In the confidential dispatch that Blake sent home, he quoted Nambiar's assurance to him that the author of "Behind Bangalore: The Origins of the Long Jihad",[^46] had "obviously has been briefed, most likely by the Intelligence Bureau (IB)."
