_In re._: Defence of the accused

134. Since the case put forward by the prosecution against these accused has fallen flat and it has been established that the encounter so projected by the police was an absolutely fake and stage managed, the defence put forward by the accused that they are innocent and have been framed up falsely in this case gains credence. Even otherwise, it has been proved on record by DW1 Gulam Moinuddin Dar (one of the accused) that he has been engaged in anti militancy operations in J&K and has got more than 300 militants surrendered in Kashmir valley. The other accused Bashir Ahmed Shah was his friend and paid the price for the same. The third accused Saqib-ur-Rehman also used to give valuable inputs to J&K police about various anti social elements. The other accused were ordinary citizens and no criminal or terrorism related background has been proved in their case.

_In re._: Conclusion

135. Viewed from any angle, the encounter alleged to have been taken place on the night intervening between 01.7.05 and 02.7.05, did not take place at all and an absolutely fake encounter has been projected. The story of the encounter was carefully scripted in the office of Special Staff, Delhi Police, Dhaula Kuan, by its main author SI Ravinder Tyagi with the assistance of SI Nirakar, SI Charan Singh and SI Mahender Singh. All these four police officers have acted in advancement of their self interests in total disregard to the demands of their solemn duty. These four police officers whose duty was to protect and safeguard the citizens, have turned persecutors and tormentors.

136. The aim of the investigating agency is to collect evidence and not to create it. Its aim should be to discover the truth. It is not only unethical but also illegal for an investigating agency to resort to concoction, paddling, fabrication of evidence --- all serious offences under the law --- even to bring a known criminal to justice. Its relevance in India is much felt as there are no defence investigators as there are in various western countries. Hence the machinery of criminal law is often used here as a handy weapon to wreak vengeance on the enemy.

137. Fabrication of false encounter is not justified in any social set-up where the rule of law prevails even if the person, so apprehended, is really a terrorist or otherwise, harmful to the society. In India, a section of some over-zealous, overambitious and scrupulous police officers is seen, who seem to think that if a person is really harmful to the society, there is no problem in creating some evidence or supplying the missing link in the evidence to secure his conviction. If fabrication of false evidence were to be justified because of a laudable motive, the worst criminal on earth would justify the worst crime on the ground of good motive.

138. In the present case, the prosecution has failed to produce any evidence to show that the accused persons are in fact, terrorists having links with the ISI Agency of Pakistan. No investigation has been conducted in this regard by the Delhi Police. It has failed to trace out the source of the arms/ammunition allegedly recovered from and at the instance of the accused as also that of the fake currency notes. No investigation has been carried out in Gurgaon from where the accused allegedly came to Delhi alongwith arms/ammunition. The secret information received by SI Ravinder Tyagi has turned out to be absolutely concocted. So, where was the justification for the raid and encounter.

139. See the plight of these seven accused, out of whom five have been languishing in jail for about five and a half years now for no fault of theirs. They are totally innocent and have been framed in this case by the aforesaid four police officers in order to achieve their personal gains and/or to settle petty personal scores, be that at the behest of one Major Sharma, whose attempts to persuade accused Gulam Moinuddin Dar to work for him in getting the militants surrendered in Kashmir were spurned by him (Gulam Moinuddin Dar) or to earn undue honours or awards for themselves. In today's aspirational world of glitter, fine dining and mall culture, only money and material matters. The values such as service to the nation, integrity and honesty are becoming rare.

140. All the accused are liable to be acquitted and are hereby acquitted honourably. I cannot resist reading out a prayer to these accused which a Canadian Lady Judge read out to a prisoner, whom she had to free after spending 26 years in prison.

The prayer is :

>Dear friends,
>
>May the road rise to meet you,
>
>May the wind be always at your back,
>
>May the Sun shine warm on your face,
>
>May the rain fall softly upon you,
>
>May God hold you in the palm of his hand, now and forever.

141. I go again back to the stage managing of the fake encounter by the four police officials namely SI Ravinder Tyagi, SI Nirakar, SI Charan Singh and SI Mahender Singh, as it is difficult to take it out of mind. These four police officers have brought utter shame and disrepute to the whole Delhi Police Force. In my opinion, there cannot be any more serious or grave crime than a police officer framing an innocent citizen in a false criminal case. Such tendency in the police officers should not be viewed or dealt with lightly but needs to be curbed with a stern hand. It is because of such brazen acts of a few policemen that the general public is losing faith in the whole police system. Such black sheep, who are out to defame and bring into disrepute the whole police force, need to be identified from the whole flock and taken to task.

142. I, therefore, direct the Commissioner of Police, Delhi, to initiate appropriate inquiry against the four police officers SI Ravinder Tyagi, SI Nirakar, SI Charan Singh and SI Mahender Singh (who by now may have been promoted to the post Inspector) for the misuse and abuse of their powers as a police officer, as detailed herein-above. The inquiry shall be completed within three months from today, and report be submitted to this Court on the next date of hearing.

143. The SHO, Police Station Kapasahera is also directed to register FIR against the aforesaid four police officers U/s.167 IPC and forward the same to the Addl. Commissioner of Police (South/West) who shall conduct investigation which shall be completed within three months from today and a report be submitted to this Court on the next date of hearing. A copy of the FIR shall be sent to this Court within one month from today.

144.A copy of this judgment be sent to the concerned Magistrate dealing with the cases of police station Kapasahera with directions to treat the same as a complaint against SI Ravinder Tyagi, SI Nirakar, SI Charan Singh and SI Mahender Singh of Delhi Police for offences punishable U/s.166, 193 and 195 IPC and to proceed with the same as per law.

145. Before concluding, I would like to remind the whole Delhi Police force about the disconcerting note sounded by Abraham Lincolon:

> If you once forfeit the confidence of our fellow citizens, you can never regain their respect and esteem. It is true that you can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.
