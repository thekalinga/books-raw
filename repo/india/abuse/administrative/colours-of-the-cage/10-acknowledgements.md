# Acknowledgements

Any expression of gratitude would be incomplete without appreciating the
efforts of those who worked for my release.

To Dad, who never for a moment stopped believing in me till his end. To
my mom, sister, brother, their families, and Jenny --- who spared no
effort for my release despite the difficulties. Their support and
encouragement will always remain invaluable. And to Akshay, for giving
me the reason I needed to start sketching in prison.

Many thanks to P. A. Sebastian, Susan, Maharukh and members of the
_Committee for the Protection of Democratic Rights_; those '_Friends of
Arun_' and other well-wishers who campaigned for my release; Surendra
Gadling, Anil Kale, Pradeep Mandhyan and members of the _Indian
Association of People's Lawyers_ who defended me and continue to do so.

This book would not have been possible without the ever-willing help of
Naresh and Vernon. Naresh, for painlessly making me relive the
experience, extracting the most out of my pen and for tirelessly and
patiently helping me build the manuscript. Vernon's contribution or
rather participation has been indispensable. He took it up as his own.

Finally, a thanks to Jerry Pinto for all those pointers and comments,
and to David, Aienla, Simar, and others of the Aleph team who, in many
small and not so small ways, demonstrated a strong belief in the need to
publish my book.
