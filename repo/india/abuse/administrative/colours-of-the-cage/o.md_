Foreword
:::

::: noindent-0
I had long feared that Arun Ferreira was going to end up on the front
pages. It had been more than a decade since I'd seen him, but news of
his activities would filter down through his brother, when I bumped into
him on the street. Arun, he'd told me, had devoted himself to community
organizing in Vidarbha, the drought-prone region in eastern Maharashtra
notorious for the frequency with which its farmers took their own lives.
When, in the early years of the new century, the state intensified its
campaign to quell all dissent against the greed-driven model of economic
development it had chosen for India, it seemed only a matter of time
before apostates like Arun would become victims of its zeal.
:::

::: class-0
Still, this abstract dread for the safety for my college friend did
nothing to prepare me for the shock of actually seeing his photograph in
the newspapers one morning in May 2007---or at least seeing an image of
a squatting figure that the captions identified as Arun. Claiming that
he was a 'dreaded Naxalite', the photographs showed four men on their
haunches, seated at the feet of a triumphant posse of policemen in
Nagpur. The heads of the captives were concealed in hoods. Clearly, the
Maharashtra police had not found it necessary to pay attention to the
condemnation that swept the world upon the publication of the Abu Ghraib
photographs.
:::

::: class-0
Over the next few days, the police invited more photographers to record
the evidence of their conquests, now with their faces unshrouded. Images
appeared in the papers of Arun with his hair in disarray, his eyes
betraying the trauma of the ingenious forms of torture to which he had
been subjected. Additional details about his alleged crimes were also
leaked to the press. The police announced that he was the chief of
propaganda and communications of the Maoist party, a wily operative who
had an easy familiarity with sophisticated technology. They had come to
this conclusion because he had a pen drive in his pocket when they
arrested him.
:::

::: class-0
Most often, a story about the arrest of a small band of Naxalites would
have disappeared from the news cycle in a day or two. But this was
different. The reporters were astonished at the fact that Arun Ferreira
hailed from Bandra, the Mumbai neighbourhood that their articles
routinely and unimaginatively described as 'upmarket' or 'tony'. The
journalists seemed unable to understand how a man born to privilege had
decided to spend his life helping people less fortunate than he was.
This was something I knew a little about.
:::

::: class-0
Long before soaring property prices transformed it into a neon-lit hub
of chic restaurants and fashion stores, Bandra was a haven for
middle-class Roman Catholics, who had laboured over the decades to
create a network of schools and hospitals, orphanages and social
institutions that were an admirable testament to their deep sense of
Christian duty. But since the 1970s, this approach to charity had been
the source of debate. The discussions had been catalysed by the
publication in 1971 of Chilean philosopher Gustavo Gutiérrez's [A
Theology of Liberation].
:::

::: class-0
The term 'development', Gutiérrez wrote, did not 'well express the
profound aspirations' of people in underdeveloped countries 'to
construct a just and fraternal society, where persons can live with
dignity and be agents of their own destiny'. A more appropriate word, he
suggested, was 'liberation', and went on to suggest a theoretical
framework that united the quest for liberation with the Christian
yearning for salvation.
:::

::: class-0
As long-time residents of Bandra, Arun's family, like mine, were
familiar with these discussions. One of Arun's uncles was a priest with
strong views on the role the Church had in furthering the goal of social
justice. By the 1980s, in the wake of the Emergency, several young
Bombay Catholics who had come to an understanding of India's power
dynamics as members of an organization called All-India Catholic
University Federation had thrown in their lot with trade unions and
human rights organizations. Arun was heir to this tradition. Not
everyone chose to fight the battle outside the umbrella of the church.
Shortly after Arun was finally cleared of all criminal charges, one of
his neighbours on St Martin's Road, John Rodrigues, a man about the same
age as us, was appointed a bishop.
:::

::: class-0
When Arun dropped by to see me a few weeks after he'd obtained bail, 4
years and 8 months after being arrested, I thought he'd be
contemplative, perhaps even bitter, at having been wrongly confined for
so long. Instead, his wide smile and his infectious optimism filled the
room. He'd brought along sketches he'd made of prison life and wanted
advice on publishing them as a pamphlet. But as he began to narrate the
stories behind each drawing, I knew that his experience was too vast to
be confined to a mere booklet. I bullied him into expanding the scope of
his text. He'd hoped to see the fruits of his labour in two months. Two
years on, it's finally on the shelves.
:::

::: class-0
India has very few documents of life in its horrific jails, and few as
searing as this. If there's any silver lining to be found in Arun's
experience, it's that he emerged seemingly unscathed. As a resurgent
India throws its weight solidly behind a monochromatic vision of
economic development, Arun Ferreira reminds us that diversity of opinion
and debate are essential for any society to flourish. The worst thing we
can do to ourselves is to imprison our imaginations.

[Hi, I guess a letter from me was expected a long time ago. I have lots
of things to write but have yet to familiarize myself with the rules and
procedures out here. I received your postcards and money orders. With
the money orders you send, I can withdraw an equivalent amount in
'coupons'. These coupons, available in denominations of 1, 2, 5 and 10,
are the currency used here and I exchange them for essentials like
snacks and toiletries from the canteen. I suggest you don't make too
many trips to visit me. That]
[would be a waste of time and money.]
:::

::: chp4-0
[I am presently lodged in an enclosure which has two sections containing
several cells in each section. I and the persons who had been arrested
with me are the only inmates kept in one of the sections. Some cells
were emptied out, i.e. the inmates transferred to other places, so as to
ensure that only we are kept in this section. This enclosure is
infamously called the anda.]
:::

::: indent
The anda barracks are a cluster of windowless cells nestling against a
high oval perimeter wall, a maximum-security zone within the
high-security confines of the Nagpur Central Jail. to get to most cells
from the entrance of the anda, you have to pass through five heavy iron
gates, wending your way through a maze of corridors and pathways. There
are several distinct compounds within the anda, each with a few cells,
each cell carefully isolated from the others. Little light filters into
the cells. You can't see anything outside: no greenery, no sky. There is
a watchtower in the centre of the anda, and from the top, the yard must
actually resemble an enormous, air-tight concrete egg. But there's a
vital difference. The anda is impossible to break out of. Rather, it's
designed to make inmates crack.
:::

::: class-0
The anda is where the most unruly prisoners are confined, as punishment
for violating disciplinary rules. The other parts of the Nagpur jail
aren't quite so severe. Most prisoners are housed in barracks, with fans
and a TV set. In the barracks, the daytime hours can be quite relaxed,
even comfortable. But in the anda, the only ventilation you have is
provided by the gate of your cell and even that doesn't afford much
comfort because it opens into a covered corridor, not an open yard.
:::

::: class-0
But more than the brutal, claustrophobic architecture of the anda, it's
the absence of human contact that chokes you. In the
anda, you spend fifteen hours or more alone
in your cell. The only people you regularly see are the guards.
Occasionally, you get a glimpse of the other inmates in your section.
It's a situation designed to put the most robust individual under severe
strain. A few weeks in the anda can cause a breakdown. The horrors of
the anda are well known to prisoners in the Nagpur jail, and they would
rather face the severest of beatings than be banished to this yard.
:::

::: class-0
But I wasn't an ordinary prisoner. I was a 'dreaded Naxalite', a 'Maoist
leader': descriptions that appeared in the newspapers the morning after
my arrest on 8 May 2007. While most prisoners spend only a few weeks in
the anda or in its cousin, the phasi yard---home to prisoners sentenced
to death---these were the sections in which I would spend the entire 4
years and 8 months of my stay in the Nagpur jail.

It was a typical hot Nagpur summer afternoon when I was arrested at the
railway station. I was waiting to meet some social activists when around
fifteen men surrounded me. Some of them bundled me into a car which
drove away at high speed. I was kicked and punched by them all the
while. After five minutes, the car halted and I was carried to a room on
the first floor of a building, which my abductors later told me was the
Nagpur Police Gymkhana. From their conversations, it became evident that
I had been detained by the Anti-Naxal Cell of the Nagpur police. They
tied my hands with my belt and I was blindfolded, so that the officials
involved in this operation would remain unidentified.
:::

::: class-0
'Maar dalo saale ko. Encounter mein usse khatam karo,' they yelled,
threatening to kill me in an 'encounter', or extra-judicial
execution, a bluff police routinely use to
scare people they've detained.
:::

::: class-0
I could hear screams from the next room. Someone else was being beaten
too. The blows were interspersed with questions and promises. 'Sach sach
bolo to chhoda jayega' (If you tell the truth, you will be set free.)
The man wasn't even given a chance to answer before I heard his next
scream.
:::

::: class-0
Through the day, I was flogged with belts, kicked and slapped, as they
attempted to soften me up for the interrogations that were to follow.
They were especially angry because no one was answering the phone at my
home in Mumbai and they assumed I had given them a false address. As it
turned out, my family was away on vacation. But how could I explain this
to people who just wanted to beat the hell out of me?
:::

::: class-0
I was afraid they'd kill me. Thus far, there was nothing official about
my detention. They hadn't shown me a warrant, nor had I been taken to a
police station. I feared that the police could murder me and pretend
that I'd been killed in an encounter. I'd read about many situations in
which the police claimed to have had no option but to open fire when
suspects they were attempting to arrest had resisted. I knew that the
National Human Rights Commission had noted thirty-one cases of fake
encounter killings in Maharashtra alone in the previous five years. The
physical torture, though painful, was relatively tame compared to this
prospect.
:::

::: class-0
At midnight, eleven hours after I had been detained, I was taken to a
police station and informed that I had been arrested under the Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act, 2004, which is applied to people the state
brands as terrorists. I spent that night in a damp cell in the station
house. My bedding was a foul-smelling black blanket, so dirty that even
its dark colour could barely conceal the
grime. A hole in the ground served as a urinal. It could be identified
by the mass of paan stains around it and its acrid stench.
:::

::: class-0
I was finally served a meal: dal, rotis and abuse. It wasn't easy to eat
from a plastic bag with jaws sore from the blows I had received earlier
in the day. The only solution, I learnt, was to soften the rotis by
soaking them in the bag of dal. But after the horrors I had undergone,
these tribulations were relatively insignificant and allowed me a brief
moment to pull myself together. I managed to ignore the putrid bedding,
the humid air and the ache in my body and dozed off.
:::

::: class-0
Within a few hours, I was woken up for another round of questioning. The
officers appeared polite at first but quickly resorted to blows in an
attempt to encourage me to provide the answers they were looking for.
They wanted me to disclose the location of a cache of arms and
explosives or information about my supposed links with Maoists. To make
me more amenable to their demands, they stretched out my body
completely, using an updated version of the medieval torture technique
of drawing (though there was no quartering). My arms were tied to a
window grill high above the ground while two policemen stood on my
outstretched thighs to keep me pinned to the floor. This was calculated
to cause maximum pain without leaving visible injuries. Despite these
precautions, my ears started to bleed and my jaws began to swell.
:::

::: class-0
In the evening, I was forced to squat on the floor with a black hood
over my head as a posse of officers posed behind me for press
photographs. The next day, I would later learn, these images made the
front pages of newspapers around the country. The press was told that I
was the chief of communications and propaganda of the Maoist
Party.
:::

::: class-0
I was then produced before a magistrate. As all law students know, this
measure has been introduced into legal procedure to give detenues the
opportunity to complain about custodial torture---something I could
establish quite easily since my face was swollen, ears bleeding and
soles so sore that it was impossible to walk. But from the deliberations
in court, I gathered that the police had already accounted for the
injuries in the story they'd concocted about my arrest. In their
version, I had fought hard with the police to try to avoid capture. They
claimed they had had no option but to use force to subdue me. Strangely,
none of my captors seem to have been harmed during the scuffle.
:::

::: class-0
That wasn't the only surprise. In court, the police said that I'd been
arrested in the company of three others---Dhanendra Bhurule, a
journalist with a Marathi daily called [Deshonnati]; Naresh
Bansod, the Gondia district president of the Maharashtra Andhashraddha
Nirmulan Samiti (Maharashtra Superstition Eradication Committee); and
Ashok Reddy, a former trade union organizer from Andhra Pradesh. The
police claimed to have seized a pistol and cartridges from Ashok Reddy
and a pen drive containing seditious literature from me. They said we
had been meeting to hatch a plan to blow up the monument at the
Deekshabhoomi in Nagpur. This is the spot where the Dalit leader Dr
Bhimrao Ambedkar and more than 300,000 of his followers had converted to
Buddhism in October 1956, seeking to liberate themselves from Hinduism's
oppressive caste system. By manufacturing a plot to show that leftists
had been planning to attack the hallowed Ambedkar shrine, the police
were obviously trying to drive a wedge between Dalits and Naxalites.
:::

::: class-0
But mere allegations would not be sufficient. They needed to create
evidence to support their claims. The police told
the court that they needed us in custody for
twelve days to interrogate us. While Dhanendra Bhurule and I were kept
in the Sitabuldi police station in Nagpur, the other two were taken to
the Dhantoli police station. Dhantoli was the station in Nagpur where
the case had been formally registered. Twice or three times a day, a
constable would come to my cell to fill in the official records: 'Naam?
Baap ka naam? Pata? Dhanda?' (Name? Father's name? Address? Occupation?)
As he went through the routine with the man in the next cell, I realized
that it was occupied by Bhurule, the journalist from Gondia, who had
been accused in the same case as I was. We began to exchange a few words
at mealtime.
:::

::: class-0
'You want a roti? For me, one is sufficient.'
:::

::: class-0
'Theek hai. Aap mera chawal lijiye,' I offered, as people from Gondia
are more accustomed to rice, I thought.
:::

::: class-0
'My jaws are hurting,' he said with a moan.
:::

::: class-0
On the sly, we would often make sarcastic remarks about our captors,
inventing nicknames for them to amuse ourselves. From our conversations,
I realized that Dhanendra Bhurule was the man I had heard being beaten
up in the next room the day I had been detained. He was the man the
interrogators had promised to send home if he cooperated with them.
:::

::: class-0
In police custody, we soon settled into a routine. Every morning, we
would be transported to the Police Gymkhana for interrogation sessions
that lasted late into the night. The torture techniques varied in
intensity. I would be kept awake for almost 36 hours at a stretch or
made to stand for long periods with my arms raised by my side, parallel
to the ground. If I let them drop, a constable hit me with his lathi. At
times, a group of constables would descend and force me to sit on the
floor with my back against the wall. Both my legs would then be forced
wide apart and a cop would stand on my thighs
so that I couldn't bend them. My hands were pulled up and stretched,
using the window grille for leverage. All this resulted in immense
pressure on my torso and groin. Sometimes my interrogators would pinch
me or pull my hair or pierce the skin under my nails with pins.
:::

::: class-0
The varieties of physical pain inflicted produced different reactions.
The pain of the piercing, hair pulling and the like would be sharp and
intense, but the body tried to and even succeeded in quickly forgetting
it. Not so the forced positions and stretches. They produced a pain so
all-encompassing and lasting that the body, try as it may, couldn't just
get over it, and would fall into a slump. My mind however refused to
submit. I could feel my anger building. 'To hell with you, I'm going to
keep quiet,' I'd find myself saying. 'I'm not co-operating.' But then, I
began to realize that the men assigned to torture me were not very
motivated. They seemed to know that I did not have anything to tell
them. They were only carrying out the instructions of their seniors to
somehow get me to give my nod to the fantastic story they had concocted.
As I stayed silent, they would get frustrated and they would get even
more violent. Instead of me breaking down, it was my torturers who
cracked as they failed to meet the expectations of their superiors.
'He's getting frustrated and he's releasing his anger by hitting me,' I
would say to myself. 'I am the person who's winning and it won't be long
before he gives up and just walks out. I just have to resist till that
threshold point.'
:::

::: square-2
***
:::

::: noindent-0
Every forty-eight hours, we would be taken to the Government City Civil
Hospital for a check-up. In 1996, the Supreme Court had made this
procedure mandatory to ensure that prisoners 
were not tortured. But Police Sub-Inspector (PSI) Bhagel who accompanied
us to the hospital made sure that the doctors did not record any wounds
on paper. Bhagel would keep urging the doctors to ignore his
department's excesses because we were 'dreaded terrorists'. (I have used
pseudonyms for all government personnel mentioned in my account because
I want to draw attention not to individuals but to the brutality of the
system in which they work.)
:::

::: class-0
Back at the Gymkhana, they repeatedly attempted to force us to sign a
statement they had drafted confessing to our involvement with the
Maoists. Through most of the interrogation sessions, I would have to
squat on the ground with my hands handcuffed behind my back. After a few
hours, I'd slump forward because I was so tired. But even this new
position wouldn't bring any relief, so I'd try another posture. This
cycle of twisting and turning would continue for hours, until I'd
collapse on my back from exhaustion. For the first few days, I was not
allowed a bath. The scorching Vidarbha summer had caked my clothes with
the dry salt of my sweat. The dirt from squatting on the floor hadn't
done much for my personal hygiene. Finally, three days after I'd been
detained, I was allowed to bathe---probably because my body odour had
become unbearable for my interrogators. A couple of policemen were
assigned to watch me pour mugs of water over my body, lest I try to
escape in the nude. It didn't bother me. By then, I had become
accustomed to their omnipresent gaze. They even watched me when I was
urinating.
:::

::: class-0
The Dhantoli Station officer, Inspector Kanwar, was the official
complainant in the case. However, because so many senior officers had
descended to interrogate me, Inspector Kanwar had been reduced to being
a bystander in his own lair and running
errands for his superiors. Whenever a senior issued Kanwar a command in
front of his constables, his ego was visibly hurt. He would sulk in a
corner with a long face, waiting for the moment he could assume charge
again. At the end of the day, when everyone had left, he would enter the
room to talk to me. He'd come by in jeans, drunk, and slowly settle into
a chair as if savouring the pleasure of regaining his throne. Venting
the frustration of the insults he'd faced through the day, he would let
me know in front of his constables that he was the boss and that he too
knew all that was needed to be known about Maoism.
:::

::: class-0
'Maoism has failed in China, it will never work here. We have people's
rule!' He'd say this with a smirk when he pronounced the word 'rule'.
'Don't you bastards realize the might of the government? It will crush
you easily. Why do you Naxalites kill the police? Why don't you kill the
corrupt politicians?' I had once dared to reply. 'So, you want Naxalites
to kill politicians?' I immediately learnt that such attempts at
conversation would be injurious to my health.
:::

::: class-0
At first, when he began his rants, I assumed that yet another violent
interrogation session was to follow and would instinctively withdraw
into myself. But after a couple of days, I realized that this was
actually a form of therapy for his bruised ego. I gradually learnt to
play along so that he could regain his self-esteem. This was one of my
first experiences in understanding the role seniority and prestige play
in the functioning of the police. (A few years on, I read that Inspector
Kanwar had been suspended from duty. He had apparently beaten up some
people who had come to the police station to lodge a complaint. I wasn't
surprised. Someone as authoritarian as he would never stand for an
ordinary citizen voicing their grievances.)
:::

::: class-0
During the interrogations, the officers would be in mufti
or without their name tags. They didn't want
to risk being identified or have us complain to the court about them.
General complaints of torture are easily circumvented, but accusations
about specific officers could be a problem. This anonymity was a
violation of the Supreme Court's D.K. Basu Judgment of 1996 relating to
custodial deaths. Despite the absence of stripes and badges, watching
them talk to each other made it clear who was the boss within a few
minutes. The presence of a senior officer would force a subordinate to
stand up, straighten their back and address him as 'Sir'.
:::

::: class-0
In my early days of police custody, I began to understand what
interrogation, taaba (custody) and pee-cee-aar meant. In legal
terminology, Police Custodial Remand or PCR refers to a situation in
which the police have authority over the accused person, a condition
that is different from judicial custody, in which the accused person is
lodged in jail on behalf of the court, awaiting trial. But in police
usage, it is a verb form of the brutal interrogation to which detenues
are subjected: 'Uska pee-cee-aar kiya,' policemen would say, or 'Hum
tera pee-cee-aar kara denge.' During pee-cee-aar, when one is lodged in
a police lock-up, one's constitutionally guaranteed rights are always
under threat. The right to silence, for one, is guaranteed in the Indian
Constitution under Article 20(3). However, every time I---perhaps
naively---sought refuge in this fundamental right, it would only entail
more torture.
:::

::: class-0
Among my more sadistic interrogators was Abhishek Kapur, the Deputy
Commissioner of Police in charge of Crime for Nagpur. He was a strapping
young IPS officer, always striving for the favour of his seniors.
Terrorist bashing would definitely get him a few more credits. While
interrogating me, he would make it a point to make me squat on the
ground handcuffed, while he sat on a chair
in front of me. His ego would swell every time he looked down at me and
asserted that he was from Delhi's prestigious St. Stephen's College, a
statement intended to demonstrate that he was a class apart from the
other officers. But if I chose to remain silent to his questions, he
would kick my jaw with his boots. I came to realize that I had been
strategically placed so that he could use minimum effort to do so.
:::

::: class-0
From the chatter of the police constables, I learnt that in 2006
Abhishek Kapur had been in charge of the zone in Nagpur where the
agitation against the Khairlanji killings had started. Indora Basti is
the biggest Dalit settlement in Nagpur, famous for its militant
politics. When the news spread of how four members of the lower-caste
Bhotmange family had been paraded naked and then lynched by a mob of
upper-caste villagers in Khairlanji village in Bhandara district, Indora
was the first community to erupt in anger. Dalit youth gathered at
Indora Chowk, burning tyres. The police responded with a lathi charge
and arrested some activists. Lower-level police staff believed that the
incompetent handling of these protests had caused the agitation to
spread through Nagpur and then across Maharashtra. Senior officers, on
the other hand, blamed Maoists for organizing the agitation. I was
trapped by their spurious theory. Abhishek Kapur had a compelling reason
to claim that he'd arrested four Maoists in the city within a year of
the agitation.
:::

::: class-0
But it wasn't only officers of the Nagpur police who were interrogating
me. I gathered that I was being questioned, among others, by officers
from the Anti-Naxal Cell, the Anti-Terrorism Squad, the Intelligence
Bureau and even the Special Intelligence Bureau of Andhra Pradesh. They
would come in batches of two to three. Their seniors would stay in the
background, designating the work of
interrogation to their juniors. The 'good cop-bad cop' routine was one
of their regular tricks. They also tried another tactic: they'd tell me
that the people they'd arrested along with me had confessed to their
involvement with the Maoists, so it was pointless for me to attempt to
resist. When this proved unproductive, they'd revert to their routine of
hammering me and stretching out my limbs.
:::

::: class-0
This went on for ten days. When all their tactics failed, the police got
the court to allow them to subject Ashok Reddy and me to the
scientifically dubious practice of narco-analysis, lie detectors and
brain-mapping tests. They hoped to use the results of these tests to
conjure up evidence for their allegations.
:::

::: class-0
We did not consent to these tests. So PSI Bhagel repeatedly used threats
and sleight of hand to try to make me sign a paper stating that 'as I
was telling the truth, I consent to such tests'. A letter of consent is
now ethically and medically mandatory, but could, in 2007, be waived by
an order of the court.
:::

::: class-0
Even before detenues can undergo narco-analysis, they are put through a
series of medical tests, ostensibly to ascertain whether they are fit
enough to withstand these procedures. In reality, the tests determine
the prisoner's levels of resistance and help the authorities calculate
how much of the drug, sodium pentothal, can be administered without the
subject collapsing. These preliminary tests were conducted on us in the
city's civil hospital. Preparations got underway to transport us to the
State Forensic Science Lab in Mumbai.
:::

::: class-0
But before that, we were produced before the magistrate. As Section 167
of the Code of Criminal Procedure permits the magistrate to authorize
the detention of the accused in police custody for a term not exceeding
fifteen days in the whole, the police could not obtain additional
custody in the same case. (After 2008, an
amendment in the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act has increased the
term to thirty days.) So the police registered new cases: I was charged
with being a member of an unlawful assembly, committing an unlawful act,
conspiring to do a terrorist act and being a member of an organization
that had committed a terrorist act. All these related to their
accusation that we had assembled at Deekshabhoomi to hatch a criminal
conspiracy as members of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), which
has been banned since 2009.
:::

::: class-0
The CPI (Maoist) represents the most radical strand within the
90-year-old Indian Communist movement. The Communist Party of India had
been founded in 1925, inspired by the success of the Russian Bolshevik
Revolution. During British rule, the CPI had organized millions of
industrial workers and, not surprisingly, faced considerable repression.
Hundreds of CPI members were arrested and many of them were charged in
conspiracy cases. However after the British rule, the party took to the
parliamentary path and even formed a state level government in Kerala in
1957. Differences within the party on relations with China and other
matters led to a split. This resulted in the formation of the Communist
Party of India (Marxist) in 1964. The new party also continued to engage
in parliamentary politics. However, radicals believed that this
engagement in parliamentary politics constituted an unacceptable
collaboration with an oppressive state and an abandonment of the
revolutionary struggle. After a peasant uprising in the Naxalbari
village of West Bengal in 1967, these groups coalesced. The CPI
(Maoist), formed in 2004, is a further ideological and organizational
consolidation of this revolutionary tendency. Because of the site of the
conflict to which they trace their origins, Indian Maoists are also
referred to as Naxalbadis or Naxalites.
:::

::: class-0
More than forty years after the Naxalbari revolt, the Naxalite movement
has emerged as a formidable socio-political, armed force in mobilising
the most oppressed Indians who have been left untouched by development.
The Maoists seek to overthrow the state and replace it with a more
democratic one. As a result, the government banned the CPI (Maoist) as a
terrorist organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act
and has sought to criminalize any sympathy for the movement.

In my case, merely suggesting that I held radical beliefs was sufficient
cause for the state to invoke criminal charges. If convicted, I would be
imprisoned for life. That day, after the court hearing, we were
transferred to judicial custody.

On 20 May 2007, I stooped to enter the low, narrow door of Nagpur
Central Prison, which would be my home for the next fifty-four months.
It had been twelve days since I'd been arrested. In keeping with
procedure, first-time prisoners are presented before the gate officer.
Tradition, and perhaps training, demands that even the most
mild-mannered gate officer be at his aggressive best while dealing with
new entrants, who, in jail slang, are called naya aamad. It's one of
many Urdu words commonly used in prison, remnants of the British era.
Like all other isolated communities, the prison is frozen in time. I
realized that it is the gate officer's job to give the newcomer a crash
course in meekness and mindless subservience. The lathi at his side
serves as a teaching aid.
:::

::: class-0
The gate officer is programmed to verbally abuse the new prisoner at the
slightest sign that he is straying from total submission. Standing too
close to the gate officer's desk or too far,
too straight or too bent, hands behind or hands in front all qualify as
unacceptable behaviour.
:::

::: class-0
The officer is supposed to enquire whether the new prisoner has suffered
injuries due to torture in police custody and, if so, record his
statement. In my case, I had a bleeding ear, swollen jaws and sore feet.
(In reality, the officer threatens anyone trying to make a complaint. By
custom, all injuries are recorded as having existed before the prisoner
was arrested.) A strip search followed, standard protocol for new
entrants to the prison. I was stripped to my underwear and ordered to
squat in a line with the other new entrants, awaiting my turn with the
man in charge of the searches, who was known as the jhadati-amaldar.
Every crevice of our bodies was examined and our every belonging
scrutinized before being thrown on the dirty roadway for us to pick up.
Grave hazards like packets of biscuits and beedis were pocketed by the
staff.
:::

::: class-0
If the prisoner's wait at the gate coincides with the entry or exit of
one of the senior jail officials, he is privileged to witness a ceremony
of colonial vintage. Senior jailers and superintendents cannot be
expected to bend low to enter through the small door, so the main gate
is swung open to allow the sahibs to walk through, heads held high. When
the dignitaries are sighted at a distance, the gate guard issues a yelp
of caution: 'ALL HUP!' All staff spring to attention and all lower
life-forms are swept into corners out of sight, or forced to squat on
their haunches.
:::

::: class-0
Most naya aamads are then taken to the 'after barrack', where they spend
a night or two before being assigned to a permanent barrack, or 'fixed
barrack'. This waiting period allows the jail staff, convict warders,
in-house extortionist gangs and other sharks to assess what monetary and
other benefits they can extract from their latest prey. Middle-class
entrants and more affluent detenues are easy
targets. They are softened up with stories of the horrors of prison life
and not-so-veiled threats. Younger men are targeted for free labour and
for use as sex objects. Contacts are made and deals are struck to ensure
better treatment when the new prisoners are moved to the fixed barracks.
:::

::: class-0
Next is the mulaiza or check-in process. A convict warder or jailer
lectures new prisoners about the value of prison discipline. The
identifying marks of each new inmate are noted and he is weighed,
measured and examined by a doctor and psychologist before being
presented before a phalanx of prison divinities, led by the
superintendent. A Body Ticket is presented to each prisoner, listing his
prisoner number and the offences registered against him. These offences
form the basis of how he will be classified and, to some extent, how he
will be treated in jail. Convicts (kaidis) and undertrials (havalathis,
commonly pronounced as hauladi) are counted separately. I was now
hauladi number 3479 of 2007.
:::

::: class-0
Even though the law states an accused person is innocent until proven
guilty, such niceties lack meaning behind prison walls. The allegations
of the police are sufficient evidence for the jail authorities to punish
even those awaiting trial. Alleged rapists are routinely targeted by
officers at the time of entry itself. One particularly macho type would
force rape accused to crawl in the afternoon sun from the gate to the
barracks---an exercise that would quickly produce thick blisters on the
arms and knees. In the barracks they would be set upon enthusiastically
by other prisoners with the encouragement of the staff. The most
righteous ones leading the attacks were often themselves rape accused or
convicts. Such were some of the ironies of the prison 'justice'
system.
:::

::: class-0
Those implicated in murder cases are compelled to wear the convict
prisoner uniform and are consigned to special 'murder barracks'. People
accused of terrorism are invariably sent to places such as the anda
barrack and many jail superintendents personally preside over their
beatings as a sign of their patriotism.
:::

::: class-0
Before the mulaiza, procedure requires the new entrant to be bathed.
However, shortages of soap and water often prevent the diligent
observance of these rules. Instead, most naya aamads are rushed through
the rough-and-ready hands of the nai kamaan (literally, the Barber
Command), one of the work groups to which prisoners could be assigned
later. Some colonial-era jail bureaucrat with a fiendish yearning for
military discipline or a wicked sense of humour probably established the
tradition of calling each work-team a kamaan (or command).
:::

::: class-0
The naya aamad's next stop is the Badi Gol, the area in Nagpur jail that
houses prisoners awaiting trial. That, theoretically, is where I should
have been headed. But in my case, the procedures were cut short. The
police report was sufficient for exceptions to be made to the elaborate
procedures. I was hurriedly put into the anda barrack, given a thick
white cotton prison uniform and after a quick meal of besan and chewy
rotis at 4 p.m. was on my way to Mumbai by train, along with Ashok
Reddy, to undergo narco-analysis.
:::

::: square-2

:::

::: noindent-0
Just before boarding the train, Ashok and I were given new sets of
clothes, our first change in twelve days. We later learnt that our
lawyers had asked a friendly police officer to help. I was also given an
old pair of rubber slippers. The cops had misplaced my sandals
immediately after my arrest and during the days in custody or travelling
to court, the gymkhana or the hospital, I 
had been walking barefoot. The baking Nagpur summer heat had made the
tar roads sizzle, so I'd have to run from the station to the van.
:::

::: class-0
About a dozen brawny policemen wielding Kalashnikovs were designated to
accompany us on our journey. To be doubly sure that nothing went wrong,
we were kept handcuffed to our berths throughout the 15-hour journey to
Mumbai.
:::

::: class-0
Thus far, I had not been allowed to speak with Ashok, even though he had
been implicated along with me. We would occasionally glance
sympathetically at each other whenever we were seated together in the
courtroom or at the civil hospital during our mandatory examinations.
This silence was also enforced on the train journey to Mumbai, probably
to prevent us from exchanging ideas on how to tackle our interrogators.
The first time I had a chance to talk to Ashok was when we reached Azad
Maidan police station, near Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. We
were to spend a night here before being taken for our interrogation. The
Nagpur police, led by Kanwar, had managed to secure a separate cell for
the two of us. This had involved fierce arguments with the Mumbai cops
and drawing on the influence of his seniors. However, seeing us
conversing in the lock-up, they soon realized their blunder and we were
shifted out within an hour. We were then kept in a police staff room of
the Azad Maidan police station under Kanwar's direct supervision. They
feared our conversations would affect the results of the narco-analysis
tests that were to be conducted the next day.
:::

::: class-0
The day after we arrived, we were shifted to the Arthur Road Prison in
Jacob Circle. Learning that I had been brought to Mumbai, my mother,
brother and sister attempted to visit me in the prison. They were denied
permission, so they stood outside the gate
for hours, hoping to catch a glimpse of me in transit. It was not to be.
But our time in Arthur Road wasn't without its benefits. Many inmates
there gave us a briefing on the procedures of narco-analysis and
generously gave us pointers on how to muddy the results, though none of
their strategies were of any use because they didn't seem to be logical.
Nonetheless, this was an example of the respect with which ordinary
prisoners normally treat detenues accused of terrorism, considering the
political and selfless nature of their alleged crimes.
:::

::: class-0
On 22 May, I was transported to an operation theatre at the J.J.
Hospital, a government institution with backup facilities for surgery.
This was essential because sodium pentothal, the drug used in
narco-analysis, can cause the heart to slow down---fatally. The
psychologist asked me to sign some papers, which I did only after noting
my protest and the compulsion of the court order on every page.
:::

::: class-0
The drug was administered like a drip, at a controlled pace, so that I
would remain in a trance for an extended time. Although the police were
not permitted to enter the room, the forensic experts used the drug with
police-like efficiency, with total disregard for medical ethics or my
health. The police had prepared a list of questions for the psychologist
to ask. As the so-called truth serum dripped into my body, the
psychologist launched into her warm-up questions. The conversation was
video recorded and, years later, I watched myself on the table: 'What is
your name?', 'How old are you?' and 'What's your birthday?', 'Where do
you stay?'
:::

::: class-0
Soon the drug was taking over. I grew drowsy and my speech started
getting slurry. 'I'm feeling sleepy,' I'd often reply, so the questions
asked started getting more serious: 'Do you 
know of the CPI (Maoist)?'
:::

::: class-0
'Yes.'
:::

::: class-0
'Where do they keep their arms?'
:::

::: class-0
'Don't know.'
:::

::: class-0
'Have you used some kind of arms, at least for self-protection?'
:::

'No.'

'Are you aware of any doctors or hospitals that provide services to the

'No... I don't know much about Nagpur.'
:::

::: class-0
So, you have any idea of their Mumbai safe houses?'
:::

::: class-0
'No.'
:::

::: class-0
The questioning went on for a little less than an hour. As my tongue got
increasingly heavier, my speech incoherent and no tangible results were
forthcoming, the psychologist began getting desperate. From questions
regarding my alleged association with Maoists, she moved to my beliefs.
:::

::: class-0
'In all these struggles you have undertaken, what is the most extreme
step you have taken?'
:::

::: class-0

'But if the need arose would you do so?'

'Have you utilized violence?'
:::

::: class-0
'No...(slur)'
:::

::: class-0
'Absolutely not?'
:::

::: class-0
'No...'
:::

::: class-0
There it was. They finally got the proof they needed. By my own
confession, my intentions were criminal and violent. The narco was
successful and she concluded: 'Arun, you can sleep now.'
:::

::: class-0
After I woke, I remembered some of the questions I'd been asked. It was
like recollecting a dream: I didn't remember all the details, but I
hadn't forgotten the highlights.
:::

::: class-0
A day later, I was taken to the Forensic Science Laboratory at Kalina
for a polygraph test---popularly known as a lie-detector test---which
recorded several physiological parameters such as blood pressure, pulse
and respiration, while I was made to answer a series of questions. These
physiological indices were measured by sensors placed on my fingertips,
palms and strapped to my chest. The technology works on the assumption
that deceptive answers produce heightened physiological responses. But
the questions they asked were ridiculous. 'Do you know Javed, Sachin and
Jyoti?' Answering in the affirmative would mean that I knew someone
named Javed, Sachin or Jyoti who was a Maoist.
:::

::: class-0
The brain mapping tests were similar. I was taken to a soundproof room
similar to a recording studio. Thirty-two electrodes were attached to my
scalp and I was made to listen to a series of statements on headphones,
many regarding my involvement in the alleged offences. The electrodes
would record my responses to these propositions, map the electrical
changes in my brain and allegedly determine whether I had
any 'experiential knowledge' of the event to
calculate the truthfulness of my claims. When I was finally given the
report after several months, I learnt that this purportedly scientific
test inferred that I had repeatedly lied, even about my name and being
married:
:::

::: class-0
[Probe:]My name is Arun Ferreira---Nil experiential
knowledge.
:::

::: class-0
[Probe:]I am married---Nil experiential knowledge.
:::

::: class-0
These tests were conducted on me at a time that courts dared not doubt
their scientific validity. It was only three years later, in May 2010,
that a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the Chief
Justice held that the use of narco-analysis, brain-mapping and polygraph
tests without the consent of the subject was unconstitutional and a
violation of the right to privacy.
:::

::: class-0
After almost a week in my hometown, I was brought back to the Nagpur
prison by road. The police, meanwhile, prepared themselves to charge me
with more cases so that they could continue to hold me in custody and
pee-cee-aar for some more time.
:::

:::

::: noindent-0
From 28 May to 14 June 2007, I was slapped with five more cases relating
to Naxalite violence in Gondia, a district about 150 kilometres from
Nagpur. Gondia and especially Gadchiroli, the other district lying at
the extreme end of Maharashtra, are areas of intense Maoist activity. In
almost all of Gadchiroli and parts of Gondia, armed Naxal squads have
fought the police and paramilitary forces with support from the local
tribals and peasants. This is in keeping with the Maoist strategy to
establish revolutionary centres in rural areas in the hope of eventually
growing to seize power throughout the
country. It is no coincidence that these districts are also among the
poorest areas in Maharashtra. In 2011, Gadchiroli had the lowest ranking
on the state's Human Development Index.
:::

::: class-0
The five new cases allowed the police to get me back into their custody
for another twenty-three days, till 19 June. I was shifted to Amgaon, a
police station in the interiors of Gondia, where I was subjected to more
sleep deprivation, harassment and interrogation. This time though, I was
fortunate to get away relatively lightly. But my co-accused were not so
lucky. The police, under the direct supervision of the sub-divisional
police officer, a man named Korate, injected petrol into the rectums of
two of them. A couple of staff lifted their legs while an inspector
infiltrated the 20 ml of petrol into their bodies. The vapours of
gasoline burned the intestine linings, which resulted in agonizing days
of anal bleeding, blood clots and continuous belching. I wonder how
Korate knew that exactly 20 ml of petrol would cause such enormous pain
yet not kill. Such knowledge could only have been acquired by some sort
of training. Ashok Reddy did manage to complain to the court about this.
However the state-appointed doctor, obviously a friend of Korate's,
diagnosed Ashok's condition as piles and exonerated the officer and his
accomplices.
:::

::: class-0
I was, for reasons best known to them, protected from such treatment.
The police would come by to interrogate me every couple of
days---whenever they got a list of questions from a superior. When I
didn't reply to their first question, they never got further down the
list, and that's where the torture would start.
:::

::: class-0
'Arre, Bajirao ko bulao,' the inspector would call.
:::

::: class-0
A narrow belt attached to a wooden handle would be
brought in by a constable---an implement
that policemen across Maharashtra fondly call 'Bajirao'. It takes its
name from Peshwa Baji Rao, a lieutenant of Shahu Maharaj, a ruler who is
credited with greatly expanding the Maratha Empire. Maharashtra's police
personnel, largely dominated by the Maratha caste, find this instrument
similarly trustworthy. The Bajirao belt was deployed carefully, only on
the palms or soles of the feet. When whipped, the cluster of nerves at
the heel pad causes enormous pain but displays no external injuries, so
I wouldn't have any proof if I tried to complain to a magistrate.
However, doctors know that such foot whipping can cause permanent nerve
damage. It reduces the elasticity of the heel pad causing agonizing
aches, especially on cold nights, for years afterwards. Such torture,
though not so visible to the naked eye, leads to irreversible harm to
the body.
:::

::: class-0
Once in a while, often due to the inexperience or over enthusiasm of the
torturer, this permanent damage extends to death. No wonder Maharashtra
still retains its privileged position of having the highest number of
custodial deaths in India. It recorded 22 in 2011, way ahead of Gujarat,
which came next with 7 deaths. Invariably, the government's National
Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) attributes these deaths to natural causes or
to suicide. People like Korate and his seniors are never held
responsible.

After 23 days and nights in the Gondia lock-up, we were brought back to
Nagpur jail. For the first time in the month-and-a-half since my arrest,
my family was allowed to meet me. My father and brother in Mumbai had
contacted my lawyer, who had arranged for them to meet me at the court.
I heard about their side of hell. They told
me about their shock at seeing my name and photograph in the papers, and
of reading the police descriptions of the violence in which I had
allegedly been involved. At first, my brother and sister had desperately
tried to hide the news from my ageing parents, but weren't able to do so
for very long. They told me that soon after hearing of my arrest, my
wife, a lecturer in a Mumbai college, had fallen off a motorcycle and
bruised her face badly. I heard how the police had searched our home,
seizing books and dismantling our computer. They also seized my wife's
sociology books and my 2-year-old son's CDs of nursery rhymes as
'incriminating' evidence. On the sly, the police had pocketed digital
watches and pens.
:::

::: class-0
Most of the time that day at court went in getting my father and brother
to believe that I hadn't committed the blasts, murders and other violent
crimes of which I'd been accused and which they'd read about in the
media. The reports had parroted the police line, with little regard for
the truth. For instance, the [Mumbai Mirror]had reported on
11 May: '...Nagpur police which carried out a search at Ferreira's
residence on Wednesday ...maintains that he is a high-ranking leader of
the banned organization Communist Party of India (Maoist) and that in
his capacity as chief of propaganda for the ultra-left outfit, he was
responsible for spreading violence.'
:::

::: class-0
The little time I had with my family in court was insufficient to
clarify all their doubts. The next 4 years and 8 months would also prove
insufficient.
:::

::: class-0
My brother told me that a group of college friends and well-wishers in
Mumbai had got together to campaign for my release. Well-attended
meetings were being organized, which used my case to prove that
narco-analysis was just another form of
torture. But their efforts were crushed when the Nagpur city Police
Commissioner threatened to arrest my friends if they attempted to meet
me in jail. My family had approached many government bodies such as the
State Minorities Commission, State Home Department and high-ranking
police officers. However, other than empty promises to look into the
matter, they had nothing to offer.
:::

::: class-0
Soon, my life acquired a predictable pattern. The police would implicate
me in new cases, obtain custody to interrogate me, inflict terrible
torture on me, fail to extract a confession, return me to jail, only to
involve me in yet another case. After two months, I had six cases
registered against me. It was only when the police finally filed charge
sheets, laying out evidence for why I should be prosecuted, that I had a
new routine. It involved making weekly or sometimes daily trips to court
to wait for the cases to be heard. The initial shock dissipated and I
started getting accustomed to the luxury of contemplating the myriad
rhythms of prison life.

dissenters \[Sridhar Srinivasan and Vernon Gonsalves, both in their

Letters to my family were not only a medium for communication but also a
pretext for mutual consolation. On the arrival of my messages, my wife
would come to Bandra almost immediately to meet with Mom and Dad. My
elder brother and sister who lived nearby would drop by too and my
letter would invariably result in a family discussion. The children
playing in the adjoining room were oblivious to the problems the family
was facing.
:::

::: class-0
Bandra, a former suburb of Mumbai, but now part of the expanding city,
was the place of my birth and where I grew up. As a schoolboy, my
worldview was limited by the boundaries of this suburb, a righteous
Christian upbringing and the impractical, lofty aspirations of a typical
middle-class family. I had my first brush with social activism as a
student at Mumbai's St. Xavier's College in the early 1990s. I'd
organized camps in villages and welfare projects for the
underprivileged. Through such camps I became exposed to the harsh
realities of India and the limitations of charity. I clearly recollect
an encounter at a camp in Talasari in Thane district in 1991 where we
spent our days enthusiastically building a road for the villagers. In
the evenings, we would chat with the residents or have cultural
performances for their entertainment and education. When I visited a
house in the Dalit pada (hamlet), one resident asked me why we were
holding the camp. I proudly told him it was to build a road so that they
could reach the market more easily. He told me that the location of the
road we were constructing would allow only
the sarpanch and other members of upper-caste families to get to the
market. The majority of the villagers, especially the poor and the
Dalits, would still use the old kuccha road. I was unintentionally
deepening an already existing social division.
:::

::: class-0
Indian society, I realized that day, was fractured by class and caste
and riddled with innumerable contradictions. Power vested in the
economic and social elite, and the benefits of development flowed
disproportionately to them. Unless these structures were changed,
charity would be meaningless.
:::

::: class-0
The communal riots of 1992-1993 that followed the destruction of the
Babri Masjid in Ayodhya really shook me up. The riots had caused
thousands of Muslims to be displaced in their own city. I was in my
final year of college, soon to become a Maths graduate. A group of us
from St. Xavier's decided to work with a housing rights organization
that was running relief camps for Muslims. The callousness of the state,
which allowed the Shiv Sena to conduct this pogrom unimpeded, could not
have been on better display. The Shiv Sena and other Hindu
fundamentalist mobs acquired voter lists so that they could
systematically target Muslims, while the police threatened to fire on
any sign of resistance from the victims. Thousands of Muslim houses were
burnt and the residents were shifted to relief camps and community
centres. In such a surcharged atmosphere, to speak of fighting the
oppressors would be seen as an act of communal violence. The least we
could do was to collect clothes and funds to help the victims put their
lives back together.
:::

::: class-0
Kartik Pannalal, a former student of my college, was a friend during
these times. He had left his family's diamond business to work to build
a just society. He regularly visited St. Xavier's to
organize the college canteen workers who
were agitating for their rights, including the right to unionize. He
helped them stage several strikes and we tried to get the students to
support them. I'd spent long days in college involving myself in the
lives of the workers, having heated discussions with student union
leaders and then in the evening, chatting with the workers and
discussing working-class issues over endless cups of chai.
:::

::: class-0
Through Kartik, I came to realize that there were many more like
us---organizations and movements across the country and around the world
that were working with the same ideals. I joined one such revolutionary
student organization, the Vidyarthi Pragati Sanghatana (VPS), which had
units in several colleges. It had student committees in Mumbai, Nagpur,
Nashik and Chandrapur and also a state-level committee. The VPS was a
member of a national organization called the All India Revolutionary
Students' Federation. The activities of the VPS centred on the struggle
for a democratic, scientific and egalitarian educational system. But
education, like all other aspects of society, could not be transformed
in isolation. Hence, we would strive to build and support other
struggles aiming at the radical transformation of class and caste
society.
:::

::: class-0
Even though the Western world was tom-tomming its so-called victory over
Marxism as the Soviet Union disintegrated, I was getting attracted to
the ideology. Stories of the French Revolution as well as the Russian
and Chinese revolutions impressed on me the true potential of the
oppressed to effect social change. Society needed qualitative leaps or
revolutions to bring about change and the present world order wasn't the
end of history. Unfortunately, my co-traveller on these intellectual
journeys, Kartik, died in a road accident in Delhi in June 1997. He was
on his way back from a fact-finding enquiry into
military excesses in the Kashmir valley. He
was only 29. Society had lost a committed civil-liberties activist and
I, a great friend.
:::

::: class-0
While in the VPS, I had the opportunity to meet with youth from diverse
backgrounds, especially from the working class and lower castes. Many of
them inspired me with their talent and zeal to change society. The more
oppressed they were, the greater their commitment. We organized many
struggles against fee-hikes and against a proposed University Bill that
would do away with elections to student unions and select
representatives based on academic merit. But the Bill was enacted in
1994, and landed a major blow to student politics in Mumbai. Student
unions became student councils and were deprived of any autonomy.
:::

::: class-0
The VPS also managed to highlight the corruption of Dr S. D. Karnik, the
pro vice-chancellor of the Bombay University, and successfully organized
students to demand his ouster in 1995. We organized annual
'go-to-the-villages' campaigns across western India to help the
dispossessed assert their rights. In the Nashik campaign, we
supplemented the efforts of tribals who were organizing against the
atrocities of the Forest Department. In Dabhol, we took part in the
struggle of villagers who were resisting the Enron power project. In
Umergaon, Gujarat, it was the fisherfolk who were protesting their
imminent displacement by a gigantic, upcoming port.
:::

::: class-0
Looking at all these struggles up close made me aware of the true
potential of peoples' movements as agencies of change. Real change meant
questioning the unequal relations of power and organizing the people to
claim their rights themselves. These struggles showed me how the state
was the principal tool of oppression. The state institutionalized
oppression. The violence it perpetrated crushed any challenge. As a
result, many sincere peoples' movements such
as the Naxalite and secessionist movements in Kashmir and the Northeast
had to evolve militantly in order to survive. In such a situation, I
could not condemn the militancy of these groups. It had a historical and
political context.
:::

::: class-0
After college, I continued for a couple of years in the student movement
and later, I joined the Naujawan Bharat Sabha, a youth organization that
got its name from a body founded in 1926 by the revolutionary freedom
fighter Shaheed Bhagat Singh. In the late 1990s, the Naujawan Bharat
Sabha was involved in the struggles of Mumbai slum dwellers protesting
the demolitions of their homes. At that time, the city was witnessing a
series of slum demolitions as a result of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme
announced by the newly elected Shiv Sena government. It allowed
developers to build luxury towers on slum land. The timing of this
scheme coincided with a spike in property prices, so construction
companies were eager to get to work as soon as possible. Slum dwellers
took to the streets. We helped mobilize them and organized agitations
along with many other groups. I stayed in these bastis for weeks.
Organizing struggles, I realized, was not only compelling but also
absorbing.

This was also the time when globalization began showing its ugly face
and people all over the world began to take to the streets. The Seattle
movement in 1999 and the militant Genoa mobilizations in 2001 against
the World Trade Organization and G-8 summits inspired us. Many of us in
the city and in Maharashtra were keen on building similar, broad
anti-capitalist peoples' movements. To do this, organizations and
activists across the state had to be contacted and consulted. I involved
myself in this task.
:::

::: class-0
After the World Trade Center attack in New York in 2001,
however, there was a change in the way
peoples' movements came to be perceived. The so-called 'War Against
Terror' made security a key aspect of state policy. In India, special
laws were promulgated to squash inconvenient truths. Organizations were
banned, opinions were criminalized and social movements were branded as
terrorist. Those who supported the right to self-determination of
Kashmiris or of the peoples of the Northeast were termed anti-national.
Muslims who battled against Hindutva were termed jihadis. Those of us
Marxists who worked to organize tribals or the oppressed were easily
labelled as left-wing extremists. The VPS, Naujawan Bharat Sabha and
other organizations I had worked with were systematically targeted. Just
as it had in colonial times, the Naujawan Bharat Sabha again faced a
ban.

In 2005, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared that Maoists were
'India's greatest internal security threat'. Some were 'encountered' or
'disappeared', while others were arrested. In places like Chhattisgarh,
Jharkhand or Vidarbha in Maharashtra, left-leaning political
organizations were branded as Maoist and dealt with accordingly. In the
months before my detention, many Dalit activists in Nagpur had been
arrested on the charges of radicalizing the Ambedkarite movement by
infusing it with the politics of Naxalism. Some of them had previously
been associated with the Nagpur unit of the VPS. All this meant that I
wasn't entirely unprepared to be arrested.
:::

::: class-0
Still, even though I'd contemplated this hypothetical situation, I
wasn't completely prepared to become a target of these excesses
myself---to be arrested, tortured, implicated in false cases with
fabricated evidence and to be locked away in prison for several years.

My letters from prison had to pass through various layers of officialdom
before they finally reached the post box. The guards would first make an
entry in their register before sending the letter to the jailer in
charge of the barrack. An inquisitive guard would always comment on its
contents, especially if the letter was in English, I suspect to prove
his own command over the language. The mention of an inmate in my letter
could very well be the next topic of gossip or the cause of the next
argument, so I had to be careful. The jailer would then censor the
letter. Material that criticized the administration was obviously
discouraged. We would be summoned and lectured on how such writing would
incite prison disrespect and indiscipline. Disparaging remarks about the
jailer could not even be contemplated. In our high-profile case,
photocopies of our letters were filed away, to be shown periodically to
the Anti-Naxal Department of the police. Once, the jailer insisted I
remove criticism of the prime minister from a letter. 'Rule 12 of the
Prison Manual states that "political matters are not to be discharged at
interviews" and in letters,' he asserted. Hence, comments in letters had
to be framed with some deliberation. I had
to stick to the facts as far as possible. But how could I hide my
emotions? That is what my family wanted to hear. Initially, I used
cryptic terminology, but as the years passed by and I grew familiar with
the system, I began to disregard the snooping eyes.
:::

::: class-0
The two-star jailer of the anda was Nagdev Pawar. His seniority in the
department should have given him the post of a three-star, or senior
jailer, but he had once been suspended because he'd been accused of
beating an inmate to death. This, I found out, was a regular practice in
the prison department. Almost all officers had been accused of misdeeds
at some point in their careers. Corruption and negligence in duty were
the most common charges. Allegations such as torture and beatings would
rarely result in an officer being suspended unless this had led to the
death of a prisoner. Even if he was suspended, it barely seemed to
matter. The case would continue for years and, after being acquitted,
the officer would be reinstated with full back-pay. Moreover, because of
a shortage of jail staff, the administration would often summon staff
back to duty even during their period of suspension.
:::

::: class-0
Nagdev Pawar's de facto seniority in the Nagpur prison gave him
additional responsibilities and also immunity. He'd visit the anda only
before the superintendent's weekly round. Strolling in, with his pants
pulled up almost to his chest, he would casually enquire if we had any
requests or complaints. He had a very strange way of dealing with our
grievances. Whenever we complained of the poor food or the fact that the
same vegetables were served at every meal for days on end, he'd reply
that he had to cope with the same situation in his sarkari quarters. His
experience from all his years of dealing with inmates had obviously
taught him that since he couldn't solve our
problems, he'd be better off claiming to share them. Either this was
true, or he was actually skimming off our prison rations.
:::

::: class-0
As the four of us co-accused (or numberkaari, in jail terminology) were
all socially aware, we were quick to respond and react to the
absurdities and injustices that were commonplace in the prison system.
This is what we all had done earlier and it united us behind bars. One
of our first struggles with Nagdev Pawar and the prison administration
was to obtain a copy of the Prison Manual, which determined every detail
of how life should be conducted in jail. At first, the administration
ignored our plea and later claimed that they didn't actually possess a
copy. This was ridiculous, the Prison Manual was their rule book after
all. Like the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure, rules for prison
administration were first codified by the British in the latter part of
the nineteenth century. The Prisons Act of 1894, adopted to keep unruly
natives under control, remains the guiding protocol for prison
administration long after 1947. After the Constitution came into effect
in 1950, the administration of prisons became the responsibility of
state governments. In the years that followed, the Maharashtra
government enacted numerous new prison rules. These, along with the
Indian Prisons Act, are collectively known as the Maharashtra Prison
Manual. British jail officials were known to have denied prisoners any
access to the Prison Manual. Nagdev Pawar and Co. seemed to want to
continue this colonial legacy by denying us a copy of the rule book.

Life in the anda makes one crave for news of the outside. There was one
particular spot in the anda where we could view a few
leaves of the trees beyond the wall.
Instinctively, that became the spot where the four of us numberkaari
gathered to chat before bandi---just before sunset---when all the
barracks were locked for the night. In the absence of an alternative,
frequently narrated stories became a source of great amusement. We would
try to start a conversation with Chandu of the danda kamaan who came to
clean the toilets, or members of the jhadu kamaan who came to fill water
in our peepas---the 15-litre tin cans in our cells---when the regular
supply failed. The jhadu kamaan, if offered a beedi, would chat till
they were exhausted. To encourage these precious snatches of
conversation, we began purchasing smokes from the prison canteen.
:::

::: class-0
Lean and middle-aged Chandu would, every morning after the opening of
bandi, waddle in with a garbage pail in one hand and a broom in the
other to empty the jhootan, the leftovers. He would bring life into the
anda every morning with his rustic chatter, filling us with news of
barrack life the night before. On his evening trips, just before bandi,
he would be much more relaxed and had longer to chat, as his danda
kamaan team were the last to be locked up after they'd cleaned the
prison-yard toilets. Chandu was from a village in Nagpur district and
had been convicted for a murder he had committed on behalf of a friend.
Though the friend was acquitted, Chandu was jailed for life. He was the
first to educate us about various jail procedures and how to get around
the most cumbersome of these. Through him, we were able to communicate
with the handful of other prisoners accused of being Naxalites and who
were also clients of my lawyer.
:::

::: class-0
Javed Gulam Hussein, a fellow inmate of the anda, had another method of
breaking the monotony. He was a Pakistani in his late forties convicted
in a bomb blast case in Mumbai in 1998. The
police had claimed that he was part of the group that set off five bombs
on the railway tracks that year. Although no lives were lost in the
explosions, the trial court sentenced him to 'double life', with no
pardon whatsoever---two life sentences that were to run consecutively.
He could stay in for more than 70 years. Initially, Javed's dark, sunken
eyes, Pathan physique and long beard terrified me. But I would later
learn that this Rawalpindi native was harmless and homesick most of the
time. He would regularly express the deepest of his emotions in
beautiful Urdu shayiri.
:::

::: class-0
Javed had come to tour Mumbai in his youth and was arrested from a lodge
in 1998 just after the blasts. With no contact with his family, his
cravings for the outside world were chronic. Almost every other day, he
would complain that he had developed an allergic rash and needed to be
immediately taken to the prison hospital for treatment. Often, these
complaints flared up into arguments with the guards. However, if he was
allowed the trip to the prison hospital, he would be back a different
man. He'd be calmer. Meeting the doctor or getting medication was
irrelevant. Making human contact was what mattered.
:::

::: class-0
It didn't take long for the prison food to become monotonous. Though the
dietary allocations had last been amended by the government in 2005, the
timings laid down in the Prison Manual for serving the meals remained
the same. British-era rules called for all activity to commence only
after sunrise and end before sunset. The jail menu and its schedule were
quite precise.
:::

::: lrmargin
[7 am:]80 ml morning tea.

day of the week, with 100 ml milk.

The food distribution was done by the energetic taapa kamaan, one of the
many prisoner-teams that play a vital role in keeping the jail
functioning. The taapa kamaan were busy from the 'opening of bandi', as
wake-up time was known, at around 6.45 a.m., until bandi, around 5 p.m.,
running around with large food containers---the taapas from which they
take their name. Two thousand stomachs demanding their timely due could
be a tense proposition and the taapa workers were a harried lot. They
had to ensure that every Manual-prescribed item reached each barrack in
sufficient quantities to supply the stipulated amount to every prisoner
who was present at the morning counting.
:::

::: class-0
Between each meal, the containers had to be cleaned out and readied for
the next meal, so the taapa worker knew no rest. Their work was heavy
and the smallest mistake or delay could invite curses or worse from the
bhais of the barracks. Their only fringe benefit was that they were
assured their full entitlement of food, a privilege often denied to
those lower down the chain.
:::

::: class-0
The prison kitchen or bhisi worked in two shifts. Modern kitchen
equipment could have made these tasks easier, but the availability of
cheap and often unpaid labour favoured economies hostile to
capital-intensive processes. The only somewhat-modern device was the
machine for kneading atta for chapattis. Vegetables were cut by women
prisoners. The bhisi kamaan carted
provisions from the godown to the kitchen, made the tea, prepared
breakfast, rolled and cooked the chapattis, rice, dal and vegetables,
and later washed the huge vessels.
:::

::: class-0
Within this unit, the post of taapa commander could be quite a lucrative
assignment. The commander was normally a convict warder, a long-serving
prisoner who was given the duty of an overseer. He was paid Rs 35 per
day, but could earn a healthy side income by trading the resources under
his command. By manipulating distribution, he could generate a surplus
to be placed on the open market. The bhais who paid him off got more,
and better, food. But the taapa commander's privileges paled in
comparison with the deals the jail officials struck with the contractors
who supplied raw materials to the kitchen. Many middle-level jail
employees were able to take enough prison supplies home to feed their
families.
:::

::: class-0
These leaks in the supply lines resulted in the depletion of food we
prisoners were served. In order to ensure that portions met the
stipulations of the Prison Manual, even the most inedible bits of
vegetable made their way into our thalis---this could even include the
rope suppliers use to tie the vegetables together.
:::

::: class-0
As a result, we were forced to improvize our way around tasteless meals.
One way out was to re-cook the food by spicing it up with pickles and
chilli-garlic powder purchased from the prison canteen. This process was
called handi, after the cooking pots we fashioned out of aluminium
plates. We would fabricate a fireplace with bricks or by chiselling and
reshaping other aluminium vessels. Strips of newspaper and sun-dried
chapattis were used for fuel, but sometimes bits of plastic, dry twigs,
old clothes, pilfered prison bedding and even copies of legal documents
found their way into the hearth.
:::

::: class-0
Handi was also the term for the group of prisoners who took their meals
together. They pooled the provisions they bought from the canteen and
foraged from elsewhere. In the barracks, all the members of a handi
group (who were called handi-waale) sleep in one place. For people like
me, locked individually in different cells, eating dinner together was
not possible. Still, we ensured that the food cooked in one cell was
passed on to the others. This was managed through a device called the
gaadi. The dishes would be placed on a piece of cloth that was dragged
along the ground by using a string thrown from one cell to the next,
rather like a sleigh.
:::

::: class-0
Work was another way to relieve the monotony of prison. Convicts serving
terms of rigorous imprisonment were paid for the work they performed at
three different rates, depending on the tasks they had been allotted.
But given the meagre wages, everyone was always looking to see what they
could skim off the top or the bottom. For instance, the nai kaaman
usually dished out military haircuts and bloody shaves. But for friends
and paying customers, they could be persuaded to offer varied
hairstyles, trimmed beards and shaped side-burns. Such embellishments
salved, if not salvaged, egos bruised and battered by the realities of
an existence behind bars. Another source of income for those in this
kaaman was the sale of shaving blades. Only a few jails allowed blades
to be sold in the canteens, because these could be used as weapons. This
created an enormous demand for razors from prisoners wary of HIV.
:::

::: class-0
The factory kamaans produced products in the prison workshop that were
sold beyond the jail gates. They toiled on power-looms, handlooms, doing
tailoring, iron-work, woodwork and even farm work. The jhaadu kaaman was
the team with the task of sweeping and cleaning all the common
areas such as the grounds and godowns. While
the regular team was quite small, their workforce swelled each morning
with the forced induction of the naya aamads. Since this new lot could
easily be pushed to do free labour of any sort, they were normally put
under the jhaadu kaaman, to cut grass, clean, and carry loads. The
regular jhaadu kaaman sweepers donned the officious air of supervisors.
Choice abuses, dark threats and an occasional cuff on the ears ensured
that most of the naya aamads toiled in earnest.
:::

::: class-0
These procedures did not apply to regulars who had made previous trips
to jail. They were more involved in re-establishing old contacts,
impressing new ones, and arranging for creature comforts for their
latest stint inside. These were the kaala topis, a term that arose from
the black caps that habitual offenders were once forced to wear. The
black cap has been dispensed with but the term is still applied to the
canny souls who thrive on their knowledge of the intricacies of jail
life. An important aspect of this involved knowing your place in the
jail pecking order determined by how long you'd been inside, the number
of trips you'd made there, the severity of your crime and, above all,
proximity to the bhai.
:::

::: class-0
Each barrack had its bhai to whom all lesser mortals claimed (or aspired
to) proximity. Those who managed to get close to the bhai could hope for
some alleviation of discomfort in the form of a cleaner or full set of
bistar (bedding). Though the Prison Manual prescribed that the bistar
allocated to each prisoner should include a dhurrie, a bedsheet, two
cotton-wool blankets in winter and a pillow with pillow-case, the naya
aamad could consider himself lucky if he managed to get a single
tattered, filthy blanket or dhurrie. And even if he did obtain a
dhurrie, this did not ensure that the dhurrie-possessor would find the 2
ft x 6 ft floor space needed to lay it out
on---because the barracks, designed for seventy-five prisoners, were
occupied by more than 200. This was another thing that a bhai could fix.
:::

::: class-0
Since the prime space---against the walls---had already been taken up by
earlier occupants, the only space for newcomers lay in the passageway,
between the sleepers. As long as others were awake and eating, this
passageway was crowded with the activity of those moving to and from the
TV, toilet, washing-place and garbage can. It was only late at night,
when this traffic died down, that the thoroughfare could be cleaned up
and the beech-bistar waale finally wriggle into their wretched spaces.
In such circumstances, finding sleep was like chasing a mirage. You
almost reached it but were never quite there.
:::

::: class-0
That is not to say that the side-bistars who managed sufficient floor
space under the fan or near the window, due to seniority or services in
cash or kind, were well off. Harsh lights shining through the night
ensured that sleep could never be soothing and relaxed. There were also
the regular yells of the night sentries. Despite the barracks being
locked at night, security demanded that convict-watchmen patrol the
length of the barrack. The jail staff on the outside came by ever so
often to check on the sentry and the prisoners, taking care to note the
presence of special inmates such as Naxalites and lal topis, literally
'red hats', people who had attempted to escape and were identified by
the red arm-bands sewed on their prison uniforms. After reassuring
themselves that all was well, they would yell out a list of the numbers:
'Tre-chalees kaidi, ek-sau-pachattar hauladi, athaara Naxalwadi, char
lal topi, total do-sou-chalees. Sab khairiyat hain.' This ritual was
designed to ensure that the watchmen were not asleep, but provided a
steady stream of interruptions to all but the heaviest
sleepers.
:::

::: class-0
But even the deepest sleepers sometimes had to surrender to the other
sounds of the prison night. With each inmate living through his own
private nightmare, moans, groans and sobs from adjoining sleepers were
frequent. The awakened neighbour usually slapped the offender into
silence. But not all troubled souls were so easily subdued. There were
those who pierced the night with shrill screams and shrieks and were
usually beaten up before they quietened. The screamer, who actually
needed psychiatric help, didn't even get sympathy. As the whole barrack
was roused, the more vicious types joined the watchmen in beating and
kicking him. Many believed it to be the only possible therapy to
exorcise the devil which had taken possession of the troubled man. In a
while, he was silenced and relative calm descended once more. But sleep
was elusive as each prisoner strained silently to hide from his own
demons. As seconds and minutes dragged on, there was no clock to tell
the time. Another hour forfeited, never to be returned.

By the end of June 2007, the results of the Mumbai narco-analysis tests
had come in. They failed to provide any support for the case the police
were trying to build so the authorities got the Gondia Court to order
another round of tests on Ashok Reddy and me. They obtained this order
without informing us, thus denying us the opportunity to oppose it. This
time, we were headed to the Forensic Science Laboratory in Bengaluru.
The Gondia police decided to transport us there in September by plane.
Our arrests had obviously resulted in budgets being increased.
:::

::: class-0
Ashok Reddy and I were transported on consecutive days. The Gondia
police had already informed the authorities at
the Nagpur and Bengaluru airports of the
dangerous nature of the cargo they were escorting. Indigo, the airline
by which we were travelling, had been instructed to keep the last five
rows of seats vacant. Karote of the Gondia police accompanied me. He was
seated right beside me, in the last row. Flying rules did not allow him
to carry his pistol. When I was in his custody at Gondia, he'd never
miss an opportunity to brandish his firearm, so this made him feel
uncomfortable. The other passengers on the flight were initially
confused and angry about being barred from using the toilets at the
rear. One of the air-hostesses was allotted the job of hiding from them
the real reasons for this inconvenience, and apologizing for it. Their
arguments kept me entertained through the 90-minute journey. At
Bengaluru airport we were received by a team of armed security
personnel, the passengers realized I was a VIP or a dangerous criminal.
My shabby clothes pointed more towards the latter.
:::

::: class-0
In Bengaluru, the tests were conducted by the notorious S. Malini, who
in February 2009 would be dismissed from duty when it was discovered
that she'd submitted false papers when applying for the job. Malini was
well regarded by police officers across India because she always managed
to get them the results they wanted. She had apparently solved the
Malegaon blasts case of 2006, the Mecca Masjid blasts case and also the
Samjhauta Express train case. All these would later be proved to have
been falsely investigated, with the blame put on innocent Muslims.
:::

::: class-0
During narco-analysis, she slapped and abused me, pinched my ears with
pliers and administered electric shocks to my co-accused to keep us from
slipping into unconsciousness. Her method of conducting these tests was
even more barbaric than the procedures followed by the Bombay
laboratory.
:::

::: class-0
A report about one of the Bengaluru tests eventually made
its way to the press and I later read the
headline: 'Maoist Arun claims that the Shiv Sena supremo funded him.'
Malini had asked which organizations I worked with as a student
activist. I had mentioned the student wings of various political
parties. It is evident that she was not aware of the Maharashtrian
Nativist Party and considered its student wing a Maoist front. I imagine
that the Shiv Sena and its leader, Bal Thackeray, were as surprised as I
was by these findings.
:::

::: class-0
I was brought back to Nagpur by train. Within a few days, Korate had
Ashok Reddy and me charged in another case relating to an incident of
arson in Gondia. The two activists arrested in Mumbai a little after I
was taken in, Sridhar Srinivasan and Vernon Gonsalves, had been
arraigned in this case and Korate was generous enough to include us in
it too. We were all accused of setting fire to a rail engine in the
forests of Gondia.

By the end of 2007, six months after I'd been arrested, I had been
charged in seven cases: one in Nagpur and the other six in Gondia. The
Gondia cases dealt with Naxal attacks that I was charged with being part
of a conspiracy to plan, or being part of the group that executed
them---or in some cases, both. Two cases related to incidents of firing
between the Naxals and the police, one was the blowing up of a police
vehicle, which caused the death and injury of a few police staff,
another was of the burning of a railway engine at a crossing, and two
were connected to the murder and beating up of civilians. In all the
Gondia cases, Ashok Reddy and I had local villagers as co-accused. In
two of them, we had the Mumbai arrestees, Sridhar Srinivasan and Vernon
Gonsalves, as co-accused. All the cases had a maximum punishment of life
imprisonment. The police had filed charge sheets in these cases and now
it was left to the courts and the 'procedure established by law' for me
to be tried.
:::

::: class-0
Article 21 of the Indian Constitution holds that 'no person shall be
deprived of his life or personal liberty except according
to procedure established by law'. However
this legal procedure---or 'due process' as it is also known---can be
easily abused and takes several years to play out.
:::

::: class-0
After being arrested, suspects are to be produced before a magistrate
within 24 hours. The magistrate then takes cognisance of the offence and
formalizes the detention. In my case, as in the experience of many
others, the police circumvented the 24-hour limitation by claiming to
have arrested me later than they actually did. In court, the police
invariably argue that the investigation of the case requires them to
hold the suspect in custody, even if this isn't always necessary. In
many cases, especially when the accused has no access to legal
assistance, magistrates allow the police the maximum period of custody
allowed by the law---15 days. In practice, the police are able to keep
the accused person in custody for even longer by arresting them in
multiple cases. That's how they were able to hold me in custody for
almost a month.
:::

::: class-0
After being arrested and being held in police custody, the accused
person is then remanded to prison as the trial proceeds---hence the term
undertrial. This judicial remand cannot exceed a fortnight, so the law
requires judges to extend custody every time it lapses. As a result, we
spent much of our time being taken to court to be produced before a
magistrate who would grant this extension and sign a warrant stating the
date of our next court appearance. Due to the number of cases in which I
was accused, I had court dates around twice a week. The Gondia Court was
an 8-hour drive, to and fro. We'd be driven to court, the magistrate
would sign our warrants and we'd be transported back to prison.
:::

::: class-0
During this period, the police, now legally called the prosecution,
should have been investigating my role in the
offences. In each case they filed a charge
sheet---a bulky document containing the charges levelled against
us---along with the statements of witnesses they intended to rely on.
Much of the evidence was fabricated. Then came the process of framing
charges, where we, the accused, would have to accept or deny the
prosecution's charges. By denying them, the matter would be set for
trial and witnesses would be summoned for examination. After the
witnesses were examined by the prosecution and cross-examined by our
lawyers, final arguments would be made by each side and then the judge
would deliver his verdict.
:::

::: class-0
Although the law holds that all these procedures should be conducted
speedily, the huge backlog of cases in the courts meant that it would be
two years before charges were even framed against us. Producing the
witnesses in court caused more delays because the responsibility of
serving the summons lies with the prosecution, which had no reason to be
hasty about this. Through this protracted process, the judges could, if
they chose, allow the accused people to be released on bail. But I was
denied this luxury in every case in which I was implicated.

checking them and has decided to give me only two at a time. I am trying
to convince him to give me all. Such pleas will probably take
time.]

In this closed world, my only window to the outside was provided by
books and magazines. However, Maharashtra prisons do not have any funds
to buy printed material---not even for official government publications.
The prison library is completely dependent on donations from individuals
or voluntary organizations. The selections are completely arbitrary,
consisting mainly of religious books. At first, most of the magazines I
tried to subscribe to by post never reached my cell, especially the ones
that were colourfully illustrated. The jailer would decide which books
were fit to be read by us. We were once denied a James Bond novel
because its cover was deemed obscene. Every now and then, they'd block a
magazine because it contained the word 'Maoist' or 'revolution'. I was
even denied an annotated copy of the Indian Constitution because it was
too bulky.
:::

::: class-0
The employee in charge of all literary, cultural, recreational and
educational activity in prison was called Guruji. He was also the
custodian of the books in the single cupboard that was somewhat
grandiosely described as the library. At first, we had no direct access
to the books and would have to request Guruji to open it. A parcha, or
chit, would have to be written, duly signed by the jailer in charge of
our yard and a guard would then pass it on. After a couple of days,
Guruji would then come by, wearing his glasses, and long-sleeved cuffed
shirt with its tails spilling out of his trousers. Wiping the
perspiration from his bald head, he'd make
it a point to articulate his disgust at having been disturbed and tell
us how extremely busy he'd been. He suggested that we should have been
content to read whatever he chose to send us, instead of picking out our
own books.
:::

::: class-0
The total absence of funds limited his abilities to provide many
facilities. Guruji would lay out a carom board donated by someone, but
not the powder essential for using it. When my family sent me forty
books, he saw it as an opportunity to expand his collection. He was also
careful about who he lent the books to. Another concession grudgingly
allowed by the jail administration was the mulakaat or meeting with
family and friends. This was permitted once a month for convicted
prisoners and weekly for undertrials like me. Families that managed to
save enough money to make the long journey from their village to the
jail were expected to first register their names at the mulakaat booth
near the jail gate. They would have to wait for three or four hours,
braving the sun or rain, as the jail administration would check whether
or not they were a security risk or whether they had exhausted their
quota of mulakaats. If the limit had been reached, the exchange of a few
rupees could fix the problem. After an exhausting wait, the
visitors---mostly women and children---would be led in batches into a
room with heavily meshed windows, each with a prisoner waiting behind
them. On the other side, the prisoners had been warned that they should
not exceed the time sanctioned to them. Undertrials got twenty minutes
per week, convicts thirty per month. There was always a certain
desperation on both sides of the mesh, as prisoners and their families
tried to make sure that no important news was missed in the short time
at hand.
:::

::: class-0
The first visitors I had in prison were my parents. It had been almost
seven months since my arrest. They had left Mumbai
for Nagpur the previous day and reached the
prison at 6 a.m. However, mulakaat timings started only three hours
later. At around noon, the jailer allowed their application, after
verifying their identities. Still, I was able to meet them only at 2
p.m. because there was no spare guard in the anda to escort me the 100
metres to the meeting room. At the mulakaat, my parents could only see
my silhouette behind the wire mesh. I too could barely make out the
colour of the clothes they were wearing. They could recognize me only by
my voice. The wire mesh ensured that only voices could be exchanged. No
reassuring hugs.

'Were you beaten badly?' my mother asked. Dad sat silently beside her,
avoiding direct eye contact. If I were to answer truthfully, it would
only cause them more pain.
:::

::: class-0
'No. It's all part of the struggle,' I said, trying to change the flow
of the conversation. But even through the mesh, I knew that they'd seen
the emotions my smile was attempting to hide. My mom easily understood
the language of struggle. As youngsters, we'd debate the virtue of
fighting for the rights of the oppressed with her brother, a Catholic
priest who was a staunch believer in liberation theology, which
interprets the teachings of Jesus Christ to aid the battle against
unjust economic, political and social conditions. He had a huge
influence on our family.
:::

::: class-0
'How is the food here?' they persisted. 'Is it sufficient? Do they force
you to do work?' This was an easier way to introduce them to the
operations of the prison.
:::

::: class-0
Although my wife wanted to visit me, we had decided that she should
delay her trip because the police had threatened to arrest her too. It
would be another six months before she would meet me. My father was keen
to travel from Mumbai to attend every fortnightly court date. I opposed
it. Willing he was, but I felt that his advancing age wouldn't allow it.
We finally settled on twice every three
months. We'd plan to meet when I was being produced in court. However,
the guards escorting me would occasionally refuse to grant us this
luxury. Through my years in jail, my son Akshay never got to see me. We
decided against telling him that I was in prison. If he had come, he'd
have to see a silhouette with fettered hands for a father. We felt that
this would be too much for a 2-year-old child to understand.
:::

::: class-0
My family would try to fill me in about the happenings at home, the talk
concerning my incarceration and Akshay's antics as he was growing up. I
would amuse them with anecdotes about prison life---the routine prison
characters and happenings that are absolute absurdities for an outsider.
But as the number of cases in which I was being charged kept increasing,
developments in each trial became more confusing and discussing them
with my aged parents became difficult. Ultimately, the mulakaats shrank
to the ritual of me giving them a list of things I required, and they
promising to bring them and also write regularly.
:::

::: class-0
Only five hours each day are allotted for mulakaats, so if a large
number of families show up, each gets a shorter visit. Sometimes, just
five minutes into meeting with my family, the jail official at the
mulakaat desk would start hammering his gavel to signal that time was
up. The convict watchman on mulakaat duty would then start banging each
window with his stick. To make oneself heard across the dense meshing
and above the din of various conversations in mulakaat rooms, it was
necessary to yell. As the gavel and stick swung into action, the decibel
levels would rise to a crescendo. A wailing child who had been longing
for a touch from his father would barely have managed a glimpse of him.
A weeping spouse yearning to pour out her heart would barely have got
past the initial greetings. A protesting prisoner would not have managed
to run through his long list of errands and
messages to pass on. All had to be torn away from the windows as the
next batch of prisoners rushed in to take their place.
:::

::: class-0
Even lawyers had to be consulted this way. Only prisoners with political
or economic clout, and therefore the most dangerous ones, could avoid
the meshing and meet their families leisurely, face-to-face in the
superintendent's office. The worst affected were perhaps the children,
who had to learn to reconcile themselves to a parent penned in a place
like the chimpanzee's cage in the zoo. Like so much else in jail life,
even the primal joy of meeting a loved one is demeaning and
dehumanizing.

I was taken from the prison and arrested in another case, this time in
Chandrapur. The weird thing is that this offence was registered on
6.01.2008 i.e. while I have been in prison. But absurd as it may sound,
this is how our system works. During this custody I had no such problems
as I experienced the previous time, hence no need to worry. It only
makes my stay in jail a bit longer. At a time when Mummy expected that
this would be my last year in prison, I doubt that it will be so,
knowing the pace at which things work.
:::

::: noindent-0
In January 2008, the Chandrapur police had arrested nine members of a
students' organization called the Deshbhakti Yuva Manch, for allegedly
aiding Maoists. An additional twenty-odd people were detained for
interrogation and many more were questioned. The arrested students were
booked under the regular mix of charges including sedition, the Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act and the Arms
Act. These mass arrests created an atmosphere of fear among
student-activists and many were forced into hiding. Chandrapur---a
district adjoining Gadchiroli---with many coal mines, cement industries
and a paper mill, has a history of militant struggles by workers. The
Deshbhakti Yuva Manch had built on this tradition and mobilized
thousands of students through song, street theatre and a popular Marathi
magazine called [College Katta].
:::

::: class-0
Of late, they had conducted creative campaigns using street plays and
poster exhibitions at college gates about the agricultural crisis,
farmers' suicides, Bhagat Singh's birth centenary, and more. One set of
events in 2005, to celebrate the centenary of Einstein's Theory of
Relativity, had proved especially popular with both students and
teachers. The events highlighted both Einstein's contributions in cosmic
physics as well as his political views. The state seemed to have been
threatened by the fact that students had started discussing social and
political issues rather than cricket and Bollywood. Despite their
efforts, however, the Chandrapur police were unable to establish that
the group had any Maoist connection. They needed a certified Maoist as
an accused and hence I was implicated. Meanwhile the Anti-Naxal
Department headquartered at Nagpur had dispatched petrol-maniac Korate
from Gondia to assist the local investigators. He was once again part of
the team interrogating me and was probably becoming an expert in how to
deal with me.

The court just gives another two week date and finally I come back,

you guys. But let me tell you it was never intended by me and I would
have tried my best to avoid it. It so happens that some paths must be
taken however burdensome they may be if one believes in a cause. The
experience of the past nine months in prison only proves this point. For
someone like me, coming from a privileged family, the treatment I was
forced to go through is an 'exception', but for the poor this is the

fictional story on the dons of Mumbai. One finds a lot of similar
characters here in prison and especially in anda barrack.]

Salim Sheikh was like a character out of one of the novels I was
reading. His association with the Dawood gang in Mumbai had earned him a
10-year conviction under the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act.
Salim and Sheikh Rizwan Sheikh Rashid, a god-fearing Muslim boy from
Dhule, who was convicted for being a member of the Students Islamic
Movement of India (SIMI), were two inmates of the anda who had enough
English novels to satisfy my thirst. Rizwan's organization had been
banned by the government after the World Trade Center attacks. I
considered Rizwan a political prisoner, like myself. He was arrested in
2001 along with his father and other youth from his area. While his
father died in prison, Rizwan got a 10-year sentence and by now had
grown a scraggly goatee. Since I shared a
hometown with Salim and a political status with Rizwan, we would often
meet to review our latest reading. Both of them had a large stock of
novels and I was curious about their origin. It turned out that they'd
been sent to Nagpur prison by a charity called Prisoners Abroad for a
British inmate named Allan Waters.
:::

::: class-0
I first met Allan Waters when he came to the anda barrack every day to
clean the wounds my co-accused Dhanendra Bhurule had received from the
petrol injected into his rectum. Allan, 63, worked in the prison
hospital as part of the requirements of the sentence of 6 years rigorous
imprisonment he was serving. He and another British man, Duncan Grant,
were former British Navy officers, convicted in March 2006 for sexually
abusing minor boys in Anchorage, a shelter they had run in Mumbai. The
trial had been known in the press as the Anchorage Paedophile case.
During his initial months in the prison he earned a daily dose of verbal
abuse, a practice that is quite common for inmates accused of such acts.
But over the years, this tall Brit's dedicated work in the prison
hospital had earned him some respect. Allan would not hesitate to clean
and treat the most ghastly wounds, which even prison doctors would often
shy away from. He also had a good sense of humour to ward off all sexual
taunts directed towards him and would entertain inmates with
conversations in broken Hindi.
:::

::: class-0
Whenever he visited the anda, in his green hospital apron and medical
kit, he would make it a point to also bring an interesting novel or
magazine. We soon got to chatting in English. I had, by now, got
accustomed to befriending inmates accused of moral turpitude. It
happened often. Allan would educate me about the workings of the prison
hospital and corruption in general. Before his conviction, for almost a
year, he had been lodged at the Arthur Road
Prison in Mumbai, which for many prison staff was the best place to make
an extra buck. The abundance of underworld dons in Arthur Road ensured a
constant flow of money for the jailers if suitable services could be
rendered.
:::

::: class-0
Allan's stock of novels and magazines from Prisoners Abroad, which was
attentive to the needs of British prisoners in foreign prisons, were
sufficient to keep the few of us English-language readers occupied. When
it came to literature, we couldn't afford to be choosy. Initially, in
the absence of books, I'd read two to three newspapers thoroughly every
day. Some people in the anda would even read the same newspaper twice or
three times every day. The Op-Ed pages were my favourite, substituting
for the debate and discussion I craved. Within a few months in prison,
as books started coming regularly from Allan and my home, I would spend
many hours every day reading. We, the community of English readers in
prison, would always find ways to receive books and send them to each
other, despite being in isolation. When we could get our hands on them,
crime novels were a hit. Lee Child and John Grisham novels would stand
in for the courtroom drama we longed for. Friends and well-wishers would
send me more serious economic and political journals or books. So
fiction and non-fiction would alternate.
:::

::: class-0
Guruji was responsible for arranging for newspapers for all inmates. The
Prison Manual stipulated that 'a copy of the daily newspaper in English
or in one of the regional languages be provided free of charge for every
20 prisoners or less'. However, the miserly Guruji conveniently ignored
such rules and convinced prisoners to purchase their own papers. Every
day by 7 a.m., around 100 newspapers would be dumped by the local dealer
at the gate, censored by Guruji or the gate jailer and then distributed
by a convict to the inmates who had purchased
them. If the dealer did not sell a certain
newspaper, Guruji would claim that the title was not in the government's
sanctioned list of papers. We had repeatedly tried to receive, even
purchase, Urdu newspapers but Guruji stonewalled these efforts.
:::

::: class-0
Prison nurtures odd newspaper reading habits. We'd scan the newspapers
for any information that could bring us closer to freedom. Hence reports
about court judgements were of great interest. Favourable ones could be
used in our petitions before the courts or at least incite discussion
among us regarding the finer issues of the law. Similarly, news about
which judicial bench was hearing bail petitions in the High Court was
also vital in predicting the outcome of our cases.
:::

::: class-0
News in prison, like all other things coming from the outside world, is
never received in totality. The censorship of Guruji and the gate jailer
was a totally subjective process. When Pakistani fidayeen attacked
several targets in Mumbai in November 2008, officials at the Arthur Road
Prison had decided to keep inmates in the dark and didn't provide
newspapers the next day. But the patterns in this seeming arbitrariness
soon became clear. Any news of corruption or violence by prison
officials would be excised. On some occasions, we received the newspaper
in shreds. That was especially the case when we were on hunger strike.
Prison inmates, however, had their own methods of getting past this
censorship. Those going to court would find out news of what had
embarrassed the administration and spread the word through the barracks.
:::

::: class-0
But not all news of the prison department was censored. Occasionally,
media people were taken on guided tours and we were allowed to see their
photographs and reports about prize-distribution functions of rangoli,
art competitions, raksha bandhan melas organized for the families of
prisoners to tie rakhis, or examinations on
Gandhian thought. But there were days when one could not do any more
reading. The mind would revolt and wander beyond one's control. There
was no escape but to let those times pass. The best I could do on such
occasions would be to observe the ants in the cell for hours on end and
envy their cohesive social organization. Then another cycle of voracious
reading would soon begin.

[and needs to be challenged. Something I learnt young. Due to the

called the phasi yard as it is located near the gallows and is the final
place a death convict is kept until he is hanged. But don't worry; I
have not been sentenced to death. At least, not yet (just joking). In my

around eight such convicts are lodged. The gates are closed and we

We were not allowed to write letters or receive mulakaats while on the
hunger strike. The Prison Manual prohibited this. Hence my family was
kept in utmost anxiety during our protest, which I referred to later in
my letters as 'the episode'.
:::

::: class-0
The strike, which started on 7 April 2008, was by political
prisoners---those whose acts had been animated by political causes, or
who had been arrested because the authorities believed that they held
certain ideologies. In this particular case, it had to do with
undertrials accused in Naxal offences. The strike was a response to two
political prisoners being rearrested immediately after being released
from Nagpur prison. One of them was Kusma Mallesh, a mill worker from
Surat who had been arrested in 2004 for various Naxal-related offences.
Three years later, he was acquitted in all the cases. As he walked out
of the prison gate in September 2007, the police arrested him yet again
under a 'preventive detention' clause and forced him to spend another 6
months in jail. He was set free on 30 March 2008---only to be detained
again under the same clause, but this time in another district. The
other political prisoner who suffered the same fate in the same week was
Muttakka Naitam, a tribal woman from
Gadchiroli.
:::

::: class-0
After hearing this news, I chanced to meet another group of
Naxal-accused prisoners on their way to court: Lata Gowda from the
women's barrack, and Shyamlal Salame, Sampath Madavi and Fagulal Tekam
from the phasi yard. I knew them because we all shared the same lawyer
and had been communicating in prison through letters. They were also
agitated about these rearrests. We decided to protest with a hunger
strike. Like the poor of our country, we had limited choice regarding
the form of our protest. During the brief time we were able to confer
with each other, we managed to discuss our demands, how we'd stay in
communication through the strike, how and who'd contact the other
political prisoners, and how information would reach the outside world.
The last factor plays a vital role in determining the outcome of any
struggle in prison. If news of prison resistance fails to get attention
beyond the jail walls, it can be easily crushed by isolating and tiring
out the inmates. All communications between ourselves or with the
outside world would only be possible by relying on sympathetic inmates
to courier notes and verbal messages. We needed a couple of days to make
preparations and so settled on 7 April as the day we would commence the
strike, four days after our meeting. Back at the anda, my co-accused
Ashok Reddy, Naresh Bansode, Dhanendra Bhurule and I quickly worked out
the other details before bandi. On 6 April, letters were clandestinely
sent to the local press and our lawyers seeking their support.
:::

::: class-0
On the morning of 7 April, we refused tea and breakfast and submitted
our demand letters to the state Home Ministry through the prison
administration. In this coordinated move, all thirteen of us Naxal
accused prisoners from four different and isolated barracks went on an
indefinite hunger strike. Our demands were: investigate the recent
rearrests, end our isolation in prison; and
stop labelling and arresting social activists as Naxalites. We also said
that undertrials should not to be forced to wear uniforms. Unlike the
rules in other states, the Maharashtra Prison Manual lays down that
undertrials accused of murder are to wear uniforms. This was in total
violation of the general principle that all undertrials are to be
assumed innocent until proven guilty. The United Nations Standard
Minimum Rules for the treatment of prisoners also holds that an untried
prisoner be allowed 'to wear his own clothing if it is clean and
suitable'. We assumed that since our demands were reasonable, the
ministry would most certainly agree with most of them and the strike
would not have to extend beyond a week at the most.
:::

::: class-0
For the first two days, Jailer Nagdev Pawar did not accept our letters
but we refused to withdraw them. They were kept in suspended animation,
as the anda barrack amaldar hung them on the barrack entry gate.
However, as the news of our protest appeared in the local dailies and
made its way to the State Legislative Council, panic struck the prison
administration. Four days after our strike had begun, on 11 April, the
administration accepted our letter of demands, forwarded it to the home
department and within an hour hastily gave us their written replies
stating their inability, as per the prison rules, to concede our
demands. The ball was now in the court of the state home department.
Questions were raised in the Legislative Council and the Home Minister
was forced to order an inquiry.
:::

::: class-0
However, as the strike continued, the prison administration slid into
passivity. Content with having passed the buck up the ladder, they
merely recorded the deterioration in our physical condition. Allan
Waters was sent daily from the prison hospital to measure the decrease
in our body weight and other parameters. The administration was
confident about controlling us using 
colonial-era strategies they knew so well. As early as 1933, F. A.
Baker, Inspector General of Prisons in Punjab, had delineated three
systematic stages through which the contagion of hunger strikes was to
be treated. The first stage was to immediately separate the striker from
other prisoners. This would prevent the strike spreading and break the
prisoner's morale. The prisoner was then, in his isolated existence, to
regularly and persistently be tempted with food, and his water supply
replaced by milk. The final stage was to force feed the prisoner, using
a nasal tube to pump down a mixture of milk, augmented by beaten eggs,
mutton broth, glucose and sometimes brandy. Nowadays, this is easily
done by administering glucose intravenously.
:::

::: class-0
Going without food wasn't as difficult as I imagined. One has to fight
the urge to eat only for the first couple of days. After that, the mind
and body start getting accustomed to the absence of food and the initial
fierce pangs of hunger die down. However, memories of taste would still
haunt me. Prison staff would often, especially after bandi when we are
alone in our cells, attempt to convince us to eat on the sly: 'Your
friends in the phasi yard are eating. Do you want some chivda?' Or they
would say: 'Should I get you a biscuit packet to munch on in the night?
No one will know' or 'The canteen is selling mutton today. I could ask
Salim to send you a few pieces.' Within the first two weeks, my weight
started dropping as my body started eating itself. A state of perpetual
tiredness started setting in. Even daily activities such as brushing my
teeth became burdensome and the easiest thing to do was to lie down,
stare at the ceiling and hope that the administration would have a
change of heart.
:::

::: class-0
The Prison Deputy Inspector General and City Police Commissioner visited
us to observe our condition and try to 
convince us of the futility of the strike, but no one came to talk about
our demands. On the other hand, as an act of solidarity, political
prisoners in the Mumbai and Amravati prisons joined our strike too.
:::

::: class-0
About twenty days into the strike, four prisoners were admitted to the
hospital because their health had become precarious. Shyamlal, the
youngest of us, was already on a drip. We had also received letters from
civil liberties organizations across the country expressing their
solidarity, promising to intercede on our behalf with the authorities
and appealing to us to withdraw the strike considering our health.
Ultimately on the twenty-seventh day, faced with an adamant and
insensitive government, we were compelled to unilaterally stop our
protest. By then, I had lost about 11 kilograms.
:::

::: class-0
None of our demands were fulfilled, and we were fobbed off with promises
of 'we'll look into the matter'. Instead, the Additional Director
General of Police who was conducting an enquiry into the viability of
our demands, advised jail officials to scatter us in the prison. He was
also the chief of the Anti-Naxal Department, and was mainly responsible
for the policies we were complaining about. Given this support from
their superiors in the home department, the prison administration
responded swiftly. All of us were dispersed into separate barracks.
Ashok Reddy and Dhanendra Bhurule, the journalist, were kept in the anda
while the anti-superstition activist, Naresh Bansod was transferred to
the gunahkhaana, the punishment yard with solitary cells. I was
transferred to phasi yard where the prisoners on death row were kept.
:::

::: class-0
The phasi yard consists of around thirty cells divided into two
sections, separated from each other by a guard room and iron gates. The
cells in each section are ranged around a small
bit of open space. The cubicle with the
gallows adjoins the yard, within metres of the nearest cell. I was
transferred to the section of the phasi yard in which were lodged some
other Naxal-accused prisoners who had participated in the strike, such
as Fagulal Tekam, Sampath Madavi and Ganpath Kudmethe, the husband of
the rearrested tribal woman, Muttakka Naitam. An additional criminal
case was registered against us---of attempting to commit suicide. This
was the ninth case foisted on me.

Muslims are represented in prison in greater proportion than in the

Muslim festivals in prison are important events. During the Ramzan fast,
entire barracks are emptied out to accommodate Muslims. Food is served
in these barracks at timings suitable for their roza, and prison
authorities sell fruit and dates during this month. For those in
cellular confinement like the anda barrack, such community gatherings
are not allowed. However the cries of the azaan and the sharing of

worked as gardener in the compound surrounding the phasi yard. He was

'Not for us. Hum voting kar nahin sakte lekin chunav ladh sakte,' he
answered. (We couldn't vote but we could stand for elections.) He
explained how Section 62(5) of the Representation of the People Act,
1951 disqualifies any imprisoned person, whether awaiting trial or
convicted, from voting. However, Section 8 and Section 11A of the same

Debates and discussions with Asghar would continue for days. He often

By June 2008, the number of us in the yard branded as terrorists started
increasing. We got three more Muslim boys, Sajid Ansari, Muzzamil Sheikh
and Majid Shafi, who had been arrested in 2006 and were accused of
planting bombs in a Mumbai train that year. They had been thrashed by
the prison authorities in Mumbai and arrived with multiple fractures and
bruises. Sajid and Majid were young fathers who had only enjoyed a few
months of parenthood before they were arrested. Muzzamil was still
unmarried. The three were deeply religious
and adherents of Ahl al-Hadeeth, believers in the strict interpretation
of the Koran. Sajid and Muzzamil were residents of Mumbai and had
earlier been members of SIMI. We had intense discussions on politics and
Islam. They despised the Indian state's treatment of Muslims and would
never fail to express their views passionately. I had hoped to learn
Urdu from Sajid, who was an excellent calligrapher and now regret having
failed. Majid, on the other hand, was a romantic. He'd often speak about
his family, his baby girl and the football he missed in Kolkata. From
our discussions it became evident that Sajid, Muzzamil and most of their
numberkaari were arrested merely because of their previous allegiance to
SIMI. Majid, on the other hand, was implicated in the concocted police
story because he lived close to the Bangladesh border. All of them faced
the Herculean task of defending themselves from being convicted of a
crime that had left 209 dead and over 700 injured. The well-oiled
gallows haunted them daily.

Before September 2009, all the death penalty convicts---including the
brother of 'Tiger' Memon, Yakub---convicted in the 1993 Mumbai blasts
case had been housed in the other section of the phasi yard. We often
exchanged pleasantries and, on festival days, when the jailer allowed us
to greet each other, we would talk. However, in the last week of
September, after the Bhandara Sessions Court finally reached its verdict
in the Khairlanji killings, six of the upper-caste men accused of
murdering four members of the Bhotmange family were sentenced to death
and brought into our section of the phasi yard. The other two, sentenced
to life imprisonment, were kept in the general barracks. I was
uncomfortable about sharing space with men responsible for this caste
atrocity. But then, in daily exchanges, I had to learn to temporarily
ignore their brutalities. These are the
compulsions of prolonged incarceration with those most detested by
society.
:::

::: class-0
The youngest of the Khairlanji convicts played volleyball and carom with
us, while the older men would chat in a corner of the yard, reliving
their days under the village banyan tree. In conversations with them, I
realized their prejudices blinded them to the enormity of their crime.
'Surekha Bhotmange was to blame. She disturbed the peace of the
village,' was their usual defence. They considered her death the logical
outcome of the dishonour she had brought to the village. 'She dared to
lodge a complaint against us,' they'd assert. 'She was too outspoken and
bold, unlike other Dalits.'
:::

::: class-0
'But, did it warrant such treatment and death?'
:::

::: class-0
'It was not planned,' they replied. 'The entire village was angry and
the hut suddenly caught flames.'
:::

::: class-0
'Would this same sort of "justice" be given to a woman of another
caste?' I persisted. Silence followed.
:::

::: class-0
In other circumstances, such caste violence may have gone unnoticed or
at the most would have resulted in the perpetrators being acquitted.
Maharashtra has a dismal 3 per cent conviction rate in cases filed under
the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.
This time, agitations by the Dalit community throughout the country
compelled the authorities to make an example of the accused. In its
verdict, the court had concluded that the incident wasn't an act of
caste atrocity even while handing down the death sentences to the
accused. The failure to prove a case of caste atrocity satisfied the
dominant castes, while the death penalty pacified the anger of Dalits. A
little later, the High Court commuted this sentence to that of life
imprisonment.
:::

::: class-0
Though the phasi yard was home to many people accused
of brutal crimes, the severity of their
offences was never a hurdle in confronting the administration to demand
medical facilities or better food. On 13 September 2009, all death-row
prisoners observed a one-day hunger strike against the death penalty, as
part of an all-India campaign to abolish it. No sooner had I told
everyone about this than they agreed to participate. In all my
experience of organizing agitations on social issues, organizing death
penalty convicts was one of the easiest. They had nothing to lose, only
a life to win.

[I went through your letter. Thanks for believing in me, it really
helps. I know I could ask for a copy of the charge sheets in English,
but it would just delay things further. I have begun reading the charge
sheets of my cases and have already gone through seven of them. The
experience however has been quite educative. All the statements of the
police witnesses have been written after my arrest and backdated to show
otherwise. For staff of their own department, this is extremely easy to
do. It is apparent that they have got lower-level staff to fabricate all
the statements of these police personnel. The typos and errors made are
the same in all despite being on supposedly differing dates. Such would
have not been possible if the statements were actually really written on
different dates. I thought we could assist the lawyers in preparing
points. However, the problem is that the courts don't seem to start
proceedings. Now once again it's Diwali time---a time for vacations. Out

[I have 'requested' the prison superintendent during his weekly round
about my interest in doing a Post-Graduation Diploma in Human Rights via

The need to force the prisoner to abase himself is built into the
administration's DNA.
:::

::: class-0
Even the facilities that belong to the prisoner by right have to be
pleaded for. For instance, every prisoner needs to routinely communicate
with his magistrate or Trial Court judge. But the mere act of sending
these officials a letter is an elaborate procedure. These and numerous
other requirements are bracketed into the category of 'requests' that
require the sanction of the Prison Superintendent.
:::

::: class-0
This dignitary makes a weekly or biweekly ceremonial tour of the
barracks, accompanied by his subordinates, to hear and sanction
requests. This tour, which is called the Round, has all the trappings of
a guard of honour. A subedar, havaldar and sipahi march ahead of the
Superintendent, while other officers slouch along in the rear. The
prisoners are expected to line up with a suitably supplicant mien. Those
who have a request must step forward barefoot---as required by the
Prison Manual---to plead their case. The prisoner is all earnestness and
apprehension. The Superintendent's body language speaks of
self-importance, indifference and even irritation. Depending on his
whims, the prayer is granted or rejected.
:::

::: class-0
Over his time in jail, the prisoner collects experiences like these that
ensure that he knows that his place in the hierarchy
is right at the bottom---if he's considered
human at all. His subhuman status is underlined when the jail is
expecting an important visitor, perhaps the Deputy Inspector General or
Inspector General (Prisons) or a home department bureaucrat or a judge
or a politician. At the slightest whiff of such a round, jail
officialdom goes into overdrive. All prisoners are pushed into their
barracks and cells and are forced to set up an unnatural display of
discipline. Clothes and other belongings are to be piled neatly along
with folded bistar and vessels in a preordained pattern. The prisoners
are required to squat alongside this display and await the arrival of
the VIP.
:::

::: class-0
Meanwhile, officers frantically pace the passages outside seeking to
remove the traces of any element known to irritate the visitor's stated
aversions. If he's allergic to books, all reading material must go to
the godown. If he's known to object to string as a potential aid to
suicide or escape, all clotheslines must be dismantled. Nine times out
of ten, the visit does not actually materialize. After painstaking
preparations, the visitor may cancel his appointment or turn back after
a round of snacks in the Superintendent's office. Despite this,
prisoners have to suspend all normal work or entertainment for hours on
end, and remain in perpetual anticipation. Meal distribution is also put
on hold and the hungry prisoners can only hope the 'visit' comes to an
end soon.
:::

::: class-0
On the rare occasions that such a round takes place, the visitor and his
entourage stroll past the locked barracks and cells while the
Superintendent plays the role of guide: 'These are the gallows, this is
phasi yard, that is the murder barrack, these are MCOCA prisoners, those
are Naxals, that is the bachcha barrack,' (housing young offenders who
need to be kept away from adult prisoners, lest the latter's criminal
habits contaminate impressionable minds). If
the guest is not a high-ranking prison official they usually look around
in wide-eyed wonder and peer cautiously through the bars. Occasionally
one of them will catch your eye and smile or giggle nervously, perhaps
expecting you to bark or growl.

In 2008, I decided to do a post-graduate programme in Human Rights from
the Indian Institute of Human Rights, Delhi, by correspondence. My wife
had urged me to keep studying. 'Shahid Azmi, the civil rights lawyer
from Mumbai completed his law degree when imprisoned under terrorist
charges,' she said, 'so why not you?' She contacted the institution in
Delhi, got me registered and paid my fees. The syllabus was interesting:
I'd be learning about the development of concepts of human rights from
the Magna Carta onwards, how they were influenced by the American and
French revolutions, culminating in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights by the United Nations in 1948. Reading this in a place with
abundant violations convinced me that a mere statement of human rights
was inadequate. It had to be accompanied by a struggle for these rights
to be implemented. In addition, human rights violations could not be
viewed without considering social and state oppression. Such an
atrocity-based analysis, devoid of social context, would erroneously
equate the rights of the oppressors with those of the oppressed. No
doubt, the state officials had their rights, but I'd rather choose to
defend those of the citizen.
:::

::: class-0
Though prisoners had the right to do correspondence courses, receiving
my course books caused more drama than I'd foreseen. Whenever a parcel
arrived by post, the inmate would be required to go to the prison gate
and open the package before the gate jailer. On this occasion, when the
jailer saw that I had received forty books
relating to human rights, he insisted that the Superintendent certify
that they were essential for my coursework. A similar situation had
occurred when I received a copy of the Constitution of India from my
family during a mulakaat. The Deputy Superintendent refused to give it
to me because it was too bulky. It would occupy too much space in an
overcrowded prison, he said. Only after a written complaint to his
superiors did I manage to get the book, a whole week later. Like all
other fundamental rights, the right to pursue academics in prison
appeared to be a right only in theory.
:::

::: class-0
The stash of textbooks in my cell became a source of comment. Some
inmates wondered whether these books contained legal arguments that
would help earn their freedom. To many, my studies were similar to the
fasting and prayers that others took up to focus their minds and to pass
the time.
:::

::: class-0
While reading the books, though, I noticed how well-founded human rights
norms were being diluted. Principles that had been born out of struggle
and revolution were being systematically undermined. The no-tolerance
posture on torture and state-sponsored assassinations had been turned on
its head since 9/11. In the name of countering terrorism, torture
techniques used by the CIA, like water-boarding (which resulted in
asphyxiation), or political assassinations were being officially
patronized. Now, even confessions under duress are being used to
implicate the accused. The special anti-terror laws like the Terrorist
and Disruptive Activities Act and the Prevention of Terrorism Act
permitted such draconian measures. Though these laws have since been
repealed, the drastic provisions they contained have been retained in
laws enacted by individual states, such as the rampantly used
Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999. To use a confession
extracted under duress to incriminate the
accused goes against international standards established in the
Universal Declaration, as also in the Constitution of India. Like the
Prevention of Terrorism Act, which preceded it, the Unlawful Activities
(Prevention) Act, amended in 2004 to make it even more repressive, also
proscribes political organizations and parties. The problem of banning
organizations is that it forces proscribed ideologies to go underground
and criminalizes any sympathy for them.
:::

::: class-0
However, this has been happening to all forms of peoples' struggles in
India---be it the anti-nuclear protestors who were arrested for sedition
(one study in 2012 reported that protesters against the nuclear power
plant in Koodankulam, Tamil Nadu had 107 FIRs filed against them,
implicating 55,795 persons, of whom 6,800 were charged with sedition
and/or waging war against the state) or the teenage stone-pelters of
Kashmir who were detained under the J&K Public Safety Act (these
detentions were documented by Amnesty International and other
organizations). Peasants are routinely arrested for opposing a mega-dam,
Special Economic Zone or a mining project that has displaced them from
their land, livelihood and environment. If a movement chooses to oppose
the development model of the state, it soon faces an implicit or
explicit ban, a curtailment of its activities and widespread arrests of
its sympathisers. Such crude law-and-order fixes don't solve social and
political discontent, but merely criminalizes them. Maoism in India is
no exception. It is a practice that is incompatible with the fundamental
right to freedom of speech, expression and ideology.

Today being Christmas, there was a prayer service for the Christians in
prison. It was conducted by a priest and was held at the prison hall. I
took this opportunity to go out of our yard and interact with inmates of
other barracks. Such chances come only on religious festivals. Post
26/11, the reading of the daily newspapers has become extremely boring.
All articles in newspapers and magazines have the same security-centric
angle of viewing things. I can imagine what Mumbai must have become,
probably a fortress. A similar kind of picture has developed in Nagpur
as it is the venue of the state winter assembly sessions.

At the end of every year, the prisoners are counted up again and all
undertrials are given new numbers. The inventory is updated. My hauladi
number moved up to 85. Numbers are pushed up when other undertrials are

By now, I had spent 18 months in prison and was much better aware of its
rhythms. Practices that would seem bizarre in the outside world became
routine behind the walls. For instance, the trapping and hunting of
squirrels, birds, bandicoots and other types of small game was a serious
occupation because the Maharashtra government had imposed a near-total
ban on non-vegetarian food in prison. Even locusts and other insects
that occasionally swarmed the prison were collected, to be sun-dried,
roasted and relished. Cloth traps sometimes managed to snare a bird.
Others were brought down with makeshift catapults. Traps in drain-pipes
and other passages could be made to yield bandicoots. But the more
popular method for both squirrels and rats was hunting by hand and
stick. If one was sighted, the cry went up and the hunters gathered to
corner their prey.
:::

::: class-0
A well-fed bandicoot---which tastes a lot like pork---was a sizeable
feast for a meat-starved group. It was quickly skinned and cooked in a
corner, away from the prying eyes of jail staff and their informants.
The spot behind the latrines was considered safe. This was done on the
watch of the latrine-cleaning danda kamaan, who are usually low-castes
or tribals. They were omnivorous and enthusiastic participants in both
the chase and the feast. As the band sat around for the treat, the
conversation would drift back to better times. One person would talk of
wild boars, another remembered rabbits. The high walls and iron bars
would fade away. Things weren't as bad as they seemed.

Vasai (Mumbai) Sessions Court. He reminds me of one of the characters of
The White Tiger, with all his flirtations with crime and extreme poverty
in his village. His antics are presently the centre of all amusement and
entertainment. Soon they may become the cause of irritation and

The phasi yard had its own codes. For instance, no one ever
talked about a fellow prisoner's offence
casually. If by chance the topic came up, it generated a visible show of
emotion. The convict would almost immediately slip into a silent,
contemplative mood, which made everyone uncomfortable, or he would go
into a rant about why he had been compelled to commit the crime. If the
offence was sexual in nature, he would aggressively declare that he had
been falsely accused.
:::

::: class-0
Another characteristic of this yard was that everyone was short-tempered
and edgy. Small scraps could immediately flare up into physical fights
and blood-letting. Continuous residence in the yard, seeing the same old
faces day after day, for years on end, kept the convict in a perennial
state of irritation and depression. Most of all, the uncertainty was
impossible to deal with. Life in the shadow of the gallows left no scope
for hope, that essential ingredient that kept other prisoners going. In
December 2012, India had 477 convicts on death row.

It was very common for the police to rearrest a person for another
offence even while he was in prison. This was slightly different from
rearresting people at the gate upon release. It made no headlines but
the practice was rampant. Some prisoners accused of being Naxalites were
implicated in over fifty cases. Prisoners with cases going into double
figures were quite common. I've heard of a woman prisoner in the
Balaghat district prison of Madhya Pradesh who had more than a hundred
cases against her. Keeping track of these cases was an enormously
complicated task and following each of their proceedings without
competent lawyers was impossible for the majority of the tribal inmates.

Among these political prisoners were Ganpath Kudmethe and his wife,
Muttakka Naitam, each of whom were charged in over forty cases. After 5
years in jail, Ganpath realized that he had been arrested and tried
twice for the same case. Many political prisoners soon realized that
spending several years in prison for one case was not very different
from spending the same time for forty or more cases. In fact, the latter
situation seemed to be safer because it reduced the possibility of being
rearrested after release. Fear of rearrest has caused some prisoners to
make applications to the concerned police stations to know which
offences they intended to arrest them for in future. Numerous
applications under RTI were written to
various district police departments, followed up with appeals and then
applications to the court to get those cases started.

I woke up in the morning with chronic dysentery. With the monsoons
having arrived and the obvious state of cleanliness here, this is at
present the most popular ailment in prison. As usual I was prescribed
heavy antibiotics. My exams in prison went great. Although, with the
sweltering heat, it was extremely difficult to write two papers a day, I
somehow managed. The heat in no way discourages the inmates of our yard
from playing volleyball. It releases the pent-up frustration, I guess.
It also helps build up team spirit in the entire yard. For the death row
convicts who never get a chance to leave the yard, a couple of games of
volleyball are therapeutic. Now some guys out here want to learn
English. I keep trying to dissuade them in learning a language so alien
to them, but all my attempts are futile. I now teach a few of them
English and Maths. Out here in jail, the fact that one knows the
language and is willing to cooperate are the only two qualifications an
English teacher requires, given the abundance of students and time.
:::

Passing time in the phasi yard was a major problem. If there was no
volleyball, a few would gather to play a game of Ludo or carom. Another
would hover around the radio, lost in the world of [Hello
Farmaish], a popular All India Radio show that played
listeners' requests. Others would gather near the yard gate to chat with
the guards. Some would busy themselves with 
sweeping and mopping their cells, washing thalis, clothes or bedding,
more often than was required. By evening, we would maniacally strut up
and down the yard. But this was only possible when the cells were
opened, which was for about eight hours each day. The rest of the time,
we were by ourselves. While a few would join in the vocals of the radio,
others would engage in elaborate handi procedures. Suddenly, someone
would break out into shayiri with everyone applauding him. The phasi
yard mehfil would come to life.

One Khairlanji case convict kept himself busy killing mosquitoes every
night. The walls of his cell would bear the marks of the previous

underwear together to make a ball for the next day's play. Inmates like
myself hoped to devour whatever reading material we could lay our hands
on.

In phasi yard too, many sought therapeutic trips to the prison hospital
to escape the prison monotony. The prison hospital was a great
institution, with the Doctor In Charge (DIC) as its presiding deity. The
Prison Manual provides the DIC with absolute powers in his field of
operation. Whatever the intention of the lawmakers, this has resulted in
the rise of a breed of DICs who seem determined to prove the cliché that
absolute power corrupts absolutely. The sundry permissions, sanctions
and recommendations in the DIC's kitty were all available for a price.
Special diets, admission to the prison hospital and referrals to
hospitals outside the jail were the more remunerative commodities on
offer.
:::

::: class-0
As usual, it was the bhais who cornered the scarce resources. Others who
managed some attention were the ones with the greatest nuisance
value---loud abuse could often extract 
something from a DIC chary of exposure. However, those most in need of
medical care had to battle it out. But even such a battle wouldn't
ensure reasonable treatment.
:::

::: class-0
By January 2010, I won one such battle. It was waged for almost
two-and-a-half years and ended with a crown on my left lower molar. This
tooth was being treated before my arrest in May 2007, but the prison
doctors told me that the only treatment possible was an extraction. It
was only after much pleading, requesting, petitioning and quarrelling
with the authorities that I finally managed to be sent to the City
Dental Hospital to get it permanently filled and fitted with a crown.
:::

::: class-0
However, during the rains, with dysentery and conjunctivitis making the
rounds in prison, I needed to be lucky to stay healthy. For medication,
I'd have to first pester the jailer to permit me to go to the prison
hospital and a guard would escort me there. This would eventually happen
by 11 a.m., after almost three hours of constant reminders. At the
hospital, crowds would have already gathered to swarm the OPD for their
hospital card or to meet a friend. (The hospital is a convenient place
for chatting with inmates from other barracks and passing on messages.)
An hour's wait with a scuffle or two to reach the junior doctor's desk
was only to be expected. As the doctor would usually be late in
arriving, I'd wait in the hospital barrack and watch television. Others
would amuse themselves with the antics of the mentally challenged
inmates lodged in the hospital barrack. I couldn't help but wonder what
purpose was served by imprisoning them.
:::

::: class-0
When the doctor arrived, a crowd would gather around him. When I finally
managed to get to him to recite my woes I would barely receive a glance.
No doctor's touch, no stethoscope or other medical instrument in sight;
the physician would silently scribble out a
prescription. Treatment was usually determined by the drugs available in
the hospital---symptomatic relief and placebos at best, unsuitable and
even harmful at worst. I would be escorted back in time for dopahar ka
bandi. However, the antibiotic pills I was prescribed would invariably
be insufficient. The physician wouldn't give us the whole dose lest we
prisoners misuse it to end our lives. But there was no guarantee that I
would be brought to the hospital the next day. More often than not, my
treatment would remain incomplete, and at the most would nurture germ
strains resistant to all but the strongest drugs. The prison medical
system has perhaps made its own ample contribution to India's creation
of superbugs.
:::

::: class-0
The extension worker of this system of medical care was the nursing
orderly. He was one of the jail 'babas' assigned the task of dispensing
the available tablets. Besides doling out what the doctor prescribed, he
was also supposed to visit the barracks at night to provide medical
attention to those in need. This orderly, not having that much pecuniary
interest in the services he provided, was often more caring and
effective than the doctor at the desk. However, he was limited by the
shallow, often distorted, knowledge at his disposal. He often misread,
or misunderstood, the character of the drugs he was doling out. Though
well meaning, his care carried covert hazards.
:::

::: class-0
But often, medical hazards at night went beyond the abilities of the
nursing orderly. If a prisoner got sick at night, the jailer, being the
only officer, was quick to shift the responsibility to someone else.
Hence, he would order the patient to be shifted to the jail hospital
immediately, where the DIC would then become the person in charge. If
things became too difficult for the DIC, he would order the patient to
be shifted to the government hospital in the
city.
:::

::: class-0
This system of passing the parcel often resulted in delayed treatment,
as each official hoped that the next person on duty would get down to
treating the patient. This occasionally caused the death of the patient
in jail. When this happened, a huge cover-up operation would then take
place. Intravenous glucose would be injected into the corpse and it
would be transported to the city hospital. The official record would
show that the patient had left the prison alive, but had died during the
journey, before being admitted to the city hospital. In 2010, the NCRB
recorded 102 deaths of inmates in Maharashtra prisons, the
second-highest figure in the country. Not a single death was attributed
to 'negligence or excesses by prison personnel'.

case. In this case, the judge was initially ready to release us on bail.
We strongly opposed it, personally arguing before her that we had
already completed a major part of the maximum possible sentence under
these charges. For us, being released on bail would not translate to
getting released from prison due to our remaining cases. I even managed
to address the court for almost half an hour arguing how a hunger strike
against atrocities should not be interpreted as an attempt to suicide.
After hearing me she said that she would commence the trial on the next
date. What happened on the next date was most shocking. Rather than
start proceedings in the trial, she instead decided to discharge us.
Discharging means that the judge did not see any basis for even
conducting a trial and therefore relieved us of this case. Discharge is
like an acquittal without a trial. The undisclosed factor behind this
discharge seems to be the local police headache of producing all of us
Naxal undertrials to court for each day of the trial. Arranging such
elaborate bandobast for such a trivial matter seemed the larger concern.

Don't worry, things are bound to change. For me, one of my biggest
consolations in jail is comparing myself with the plight of the lesser
privileged. Here in prison this perspective is omnipresent. Wherever one
looks there is always a sorry case. So whether I like it or not, the

Each year, my wife had to remind me of Akshay's age. He, on the other
hand, had to be assured by her that I would be coming home for his next
birthday. At that age, children live for the moment and though he wasn't
totally convinced, Akshay's mind would soon wander off to something more
interesting. But the question of his dada's arrival would come up again
and again, sometimes even in the middle of the night. My wife found it
difficult. Mundane tasks like entering my occupation in his school diary
or attending school meetings posed huge dilemmas and my wife sought
solutions in her letters to me. She wrote of the challenges she faced at
work and at home due to my incarceration and due to doubts about my
innocence. She confided that she often questioned the direction in which
her life was moving. I had no answers for her.

::: class-0
Initially she had frantically sought information from my lawyers about
how long they thought I'd be in prison. But it soon became clear that
such queries were futile. Every time an alleged Maoist was arrested
somewhere in Maharashtra, my name would
appear in the newspapers and things at home would tense up. My family
would assume that these new arrests would result in the police filing
even more cases against me and that I'd end up spending even more time
in prison. But every crisis has its saviours. My brother, sister and the
parents of Akshay's friends would strive to see that he did not feel my
absence. They would be around whenever he needed a father or my wife
needed a friend.

[Last week two more persons were sentenced to death by the Nagpur Court.
It seems to be the most fashionable thing to do. Now since all the
30-odd cells of the phasi yard have been filled I was made to vacate my
cell there. I am presently given a cell in the separate yard of Badi
Gol, otherwise known as gunahkhaana. Badi Gol would resemble a huge
spider from space and I would be in one of its legs. It is the southern
octagon meant for undertrial]
[prisoners, as different from the Chhoti Gol---the northern octagon for
convicts. Hence please note the change of my address.]

[In this yard, my two other co-accused, Dhanendra and Naresh, are kept
in adjoining cells. And the other Naxal accused, Sampath and Fagulal,
the tribal boys whom I used to teach English and Maths are also kept
here. Hence lots of familiar faces and 'family'. Guess October may be
the month for the Nagpur Court judgement. I too have been getting
anxious and jittery about the case as it comes to a close.]
:::

::: cont-0
Life in my new lodgings was an improvement on the previous two prison
locations. Although I was still locked up in a cell alone and
technically isolated from the other prisoners, I managed to meet them,
as I began to understand the intricacies of prison life. For instance, I
learnt how to negotiate the mad morning rush at the tanki or haus, as
the bathing tank was known. Four hundred prospective bathers from two
barracks laying claim to a 60 by 3 foot trough meant a hurried bath even
at the best of times. In summer, when the water being pumped out of the
well was likely to run dry, the pace was frantic. Jail lore tells of the
guy who was not fast enough and had to rinse off the soap by catching
the drops falling off his neighbour's body. The ones who hadn't learnt
to brush teeth, take a bath and rinse out their underwear in ten minutes
flat were destined to scrape the bottom of the haus. If you wanted to
wash your clothes, you had to forego your bath. Even in the monsoon and
winter months, the water was pumped into the trough only at fixed
intervals and anyone who did not plan his water usage precisely was
likely to be left high and dry.
:::

::: class-0
Negotiating the morning crowds at the tanki and the long lines at the
toilets required not only speed but some presence of
mind. This was particularly important in the
yards and barracks with a large number of undertrials who had to get
ready to attend court. In less than two hours, between the opening of
the barracks at 6.45 a.m. and court call at 8.30 a.m., they had not only
to use the toilet and have a bath, but also catch the queues to collect
and then consume their tea at 7 a.m., breakfast at 7.30 a.m. and their
lunch between 8 a.m. and 8.30 a.m.
:::

::: class-0
It wasn't easy for my body to adjust to the absurdity of having lunch
just a half hour after breakfast. The early lunches, like so much else
in prison, were the result of sheer callousness. Undertrials often spend
the hours between 8.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. on their way to court, in
court, and being driven back, but the jail authorities did not see fit
to provide us a packed lunch that could be eaten in the afternoon. But
since the Prison Manual, which governs all activities in prison, laid
down exactly what a prisoner must consume, the authorities fulfilled
their obligations by distributing lunch to undertrials at 8 a.m. But
when you are one among many hundreds running after scarce resources, you
normally ended up giving up something---either the toilet or bath,
breakfast or lunch.

[I have just arrived from the Nagpur Court. Once again no witness has
turned up. I seriously doubt whether the police served the summons to
the two witnesses. I do hope we are produced before the Gondia judge
this time. For the past one year we have been going to court, but have
never been produced before the judge. His complaint is that we do not
reach court on time i.e.][in the
session before lunch, which is impossible since the police escort party
turns up late. As a result the trials have been delayed. We have sent
off applications to the Nagpur city police chief to rectify this.
However there has been no change in the situation. I am applying for
discharge in two cases in Gondia, as there is absolutely no evidence
against me. The prosecution has only relied on the alleged confessional
statement of my co-accused Ashok. If discharge is granted, it will save
me the process of going through the entire trial.]
:::

::: noindent-0
Another exercise calculated to remind us of our worthlessness was the
recurrent jail jhadati, or searches. Without notice, a band of jail
constables and officers would swoop down on a barrack and search the
inmates' belongings. One night, I was woken up to the sound of cell gate
latches clanging open.
:::

::: class-0
'Jhadati aaya,' whispered Ganpath Kudmethe, the inmate in the cell
adjoining mine. I, in turn, had to pass the news down the line in case
someone wanted to hide something. The crevices of the wall or the spot
under the earthen water gada were the usual places to be checked. One by
one, each barrack and each cell was searched. After the door of the
adjoining cell was locked, my door was opened. I was made to stand
outside as five or seven guards barged in, supervised by a jailer.
Within seconds, everything was upturned and inspected. With his dirty
boots, the jail staff stomped all over the cell and the bistar I had
carefully cleaned. The feeling of powerlessness and disquiet while
watching my meagre belongings being overturned and flung to the ground
is not easily described.
:::

::: class-0
'Why do you keep so many books and papers?' I had expected this, but
before I answered another one followed. 'Collect his extra clothes.
Don't you know civil clothes aren't 
allowed?' Containers, twine, curd, extra cloth and plastic glasses got
chucked out along with my clothes. The presence of twenty to thirty
prison staff around me suggested that any thought of even verbal
resistance was foolish.
:::

::: class-0
These searches were supposedly aimed at unearthing banned items. But the
definition of banned was ever-changing and depended on the whims of the
superintendent, or senior jailer, or even the sipahi conducting the
search. Thus an item of food, stationery, clothing or bedding permitted
by one officer could become contraband under another dispensation. Legal
books would be confiscated because they were suddenly not allowed. After
I heard that the police had used the diary maintained by another inmate
as evidence in court, I decided to destroy the notes I'd been keeping
about my prison experiences, which is why I have had to rely on letters
I sent to my family to reconstruct my years in jail.
:::

::: class-0
Of course, prisoners with charas, ganja, mobile phones and other items
that were actually contraband had nothing to fear. The bhais would be
warned about the raids in advance by the staff. They had good reason to
offer these tip-offs. After all, it was the staff that smuggled in these
illegal items and had a vested interest in ensuring that nothing got
discovered. In jail lingo, they were referred to as 'taxis'. A taxi
would arrange to pick up money from family or a friend in return for a
standard fee of 40 per cent. Other contraband items were priced
differently. Even a mobile phone battery could be charged for a fee.
Occasionally, when a tiff broke out between the bhai and the guard, one
could assume it was a deal gone sour. However neither party would take
the matter higher up for fear that the supervisors would have to be
included in the cut. In the unlikely event of contraband being
discovered during a search, it would be a 
minion of the bhai, or even some innocent, who would have to take the
rap.
:::

::: class-0
Corporal punishment, though banned, is alive and kicking in Indian
jails. Possession of contraband, fighting with other inmates,
disobedience, questioning an officer or merely looking him in the eye
could merit lathi blows, kicks and cuffs. Gira dena---to fell to the
ground---was the term used for the type of treatment many officers meted
out. The victim was forced to the floor while a bunch of jail employees
pounced on him with sticks, kicks and abuse. A more sophisticated
version was naal bandhi wherein the prisoner's legs were thrust between
bars and lathi blows inflicted on the soles. The more vicious and
energetic lathi-wielders aimed to break a few batons and bones. Often,
they succeeded.
:::

::: class-0
The DIC then swung into action---to cover up injuries rather than
provide care. He certified that the injuries were minor and did not
merit treatment at an outside hospital. Painkillers were administered
and the patient transferred away from his barracks into some form of
isolation. If he were an undertrial, it would be risky to allow him to
go to court as that could mean a complaint there against jail officials.
The helpful DIC would be at hand to certify that the undertrial was
unfit and could not attend court. This state of affairs would continue
until the wounds healed or were at least not visible. Such concealment,
however, was not to the taste of all the officers. Many of them spoke
nostalgically of the good old days before the spread of awareness about
human rights and prisoner rights.
:::

::: class-0
Taksande, our Badi Gol jailer, was one such officer. He would impart to
us his views on prison reform. 'Convicts should not be allowed
facilities such as mulakaats, furlough or parole,' he'd say. 'It softens
their punishment.'
:::

::: class-0
'But is it possible?' I'd ask.
:::

::: class-0
'The courts are to blame,' he would reply. 'In the late 1970s and early
1980s, the Supreme Court held that even prisoners have human rights. And
now we have these numerous Human Rights Commissions ever-willing to
raise their voice.'
:::

::: class-0
'None of them work, so why worry?'
:::

::: class-0
'Yes. But the problem is that discipline levels drop. No prisoner
listens to us anymore,' he would answer rapping his lathi on the table.
:::

::: class-0
When it came to sports, Taksande was an enthusiast. He was an excellent
volleyball player and would occasionally join us for a game. But in the
evenings, after bandi, he conducted his own brand of physical activity.
Any undertrial who had caused a problem in the day was singled out and
thrashed by him and the guards. It was common for two to three wooden
lathis to break during each session. During his reign, the assaults had
become such a frequent practice that inmates began to refer to them as
shyam ka bhajan.
:::

::: class-0
In October 2009, Mukesh Chankapure, a bootlegger in his late twenties,
was brought to prison. The city's municipal elections were to be held
soon and the police dutifully imprisoned such elements to prevent
political parties from doling out hooch to potential supporters. It
turned out that Mukesh was addicted to his own products and, shortly
after being locked up, started getting withdrawal symptoms. He screamed
through the night, disturbing the other inmates. The bhais of the
barrack had already beaten him twice during the night with the silent
consent of the guard. In the morning, with the opening of bandi, it was
Taksande's turn. He eagerly performed his bhajan, which consisted of
pulling Mukesh violently around by his hand and landing repeated hard
kicks with his heavy boots all over his 
body. Mukesh was then shifted to the prison hospital. He died there
early the next morning. His relatives and other members of the Dalit
community successfully forced an enquiry by refusing to accept his body.
The pressure of forthcoming elections had made it possible. However, the
executive magistrate and State Human Rights Commission probing the death
were content with the prison's version of 'negligence by the convict
in-charge of the hospital barrack'.
:::

::: class-0
Despite this, fractures from such bhajans had to be explained and not
all judges were cooperative in overlooking them. Even the
superintendent's authority to hand out punishments had to pass elaborate
procedures, such as getting a doctor to examine the victim, recording
the reason for punishment, sending a report to the courts and getting it
sanctioned. Even after all such procedures, punishments like fettering
and whipping, though authorized by the Prisons Act, were not appreciated
by the courts. Neither is Section 53 of the Prison Manual, which retains
provisions for 'whipping to be inflicted with a light rattan, not less
than half an inch in diameter on the buttocks' of the prisoner as a form
of punishment.
:::

::: class-0
In such circumstances, the best way for the jail administration to
legitimately wield the lathi was during an alarm. An alarm was supposed
to be sounded when there was a grave threat to jail security, such as
when prisoners attacked each other or the staff. But most alarms were
planned by jail officers to be used as cover to attack and punish
recalcitrant inmates. Sajid, Muzzamil and Majid from the phasi yard had
faced such treatment in the Mumbai prison before being transferred to
Nagpur.
:::

::: class-0
During an alarm, all the jail officers and lower staff, as well as the
convict warders and watchmen were supposed to rapidly bring the
situation under control. If there was violence, they
were permitted to use minimum force. This
was the fig-leaf to justify both wholescale as well as targeted attacks
by the staff. At the first sound of the bells, whistles and sirens that
announced the alarm, the staff ran wild, swinging their lathis at
everyone in sight. Terrorized prisoners ran here and there, trying to
escape the lathis and reach their barracks. Anyone outside was beaten
mercilessly, driven in and the barracks locked. A count was taken to
make sure all were in. As the din and mayhem subsided, the jail
officials would start the process of targeted attacks. Those who had
previously made complaints or defied the administration were removed one
by one from the locked barracks and given a dose of naal bandhi. While
some were transferred to other jails, others were moved to solitary
punishment cells. These cells were situated in the gunahkhaana that is a
feature of every jail, or to the anda barracks, like the one to which I
was permanently assigned.
:::

::: class-0
Violence by the authorities in the jails of Maharashtra, like in the
rest of the country, is not an isolated event. They are conscious acts
perpetrated daily to subdue the prisoner and establish authority.
Violence, submission to authority, and discipline are viewed by the
prison staff as essential to effective prison management.
:::

::: class-0
On one occasion, in 2010, an inmate was mercilessly beaten in front of
everyone in the Badi Gol. The manner in which he was beaten made it
clear that he was being made an example of. His crime was that he had
jumped over the inner wall of the yard in pursuit of a cricket ball. All
the barracks were shut and inmates peered through the barrack gates as
the superintendent and other jail officers meted out their justice. The
DIC stood by in case things got bloody. Half a dozen lathis were broken,
naal bandhi was done but the benefits in terms of discipline were
abundant. Taksande didn't tolerate even a
defiant silence from an inmate. Prison guards would often praise
Taksande for the way he got his barracks locked on time or how he was
able to discipline the unruly.
:::

::: class-0
But suppression and subjugation were not the preserve of the
authorities. Bhais and some convict warders exercised their powers over
other prisoners with almost as much force. Sometimes acting on behalf of
the administration, at other times of their own accord, they also handed
out punishments of beatings and banishments. Inmates inconvenient to a
particular bhai or warder were not allowed to remain in barracks they
controlled. Bhais extracted a variety of services from a wide circle. It
was not uncommon to enter a barrack and see bhais and convict warders
being massaged by groups of young prisoners. The washing of clothes,
re-cooking of food, massages and even sexual services were paid for with
tobacco, beedis or a goli of charas. One of the warders was particularly
notorious. He had first been convicted of a murder done for a ruling
party, and while out on parole had followed it up with killing his wife,
whom he doubted of being unfaithful. His political connections and long
years in jail made him a prison bhai feared by most and he always
managed to get a steady supply of young boys to cater to his needs and
to share his bistar at night. A big build and stentorian voice aided the
image and when he moved in the yards most ordinary prisoners steered
clear. He was one of those the jail administration relied upon the most
to maintain 'discipline' in the jail.

First and foremost, I must request you that you desist from writing
stories of the meat dishes you cook. It adds to my misery (just joking)
and brings back fond memories. In this yard too, we have somehow managed
to play volleyball. There was no volleyball court, but we cleared up
some area of grass and have begun our evening games. Inmates from other
barracks too join us and hence we are able to play nearly six to a side.
However due to sudden rains the ground has become marshy. We have
requested the superintendent to provide us sand. But I doubt whether it
will ever arrive. Our 'request' (plea) for a new volleyball itself took
almost four months to be answered.

::: noindent-0
The condition of sports, recreation and entertainment in prisons is
apparent from the state's expenditure on welfare activities of inmates.
According to the NCRB, Maharashtra had absolutely no expenditure on
welfare activities from 1995 to 2011, except for the year 2010, where a
meagre Rs 20,000 was spent. For a state that is among those with the
highest number of prisons in the country, such a situation is unnerving.
With no expenditure, the administration relies on donations of
benefactors and non-governmental organizations. Games such as carom and
volleyball are sparingly provided by the prison authorities; however,
initiatives for sports or tournaments are generally discouraged on the
grounds of security and discipline. In the Badi Gol, we had just one
carom board and one volleyball for almost a thousand inmates. Chess
pieces had to be privately purchased and playing cards were confiscated
during jhadatis. The administration argues they are used for gambling.
Similarly, organizing cultural programmes and expenditure on TV sets,
radio or video facilities are minimal and depend on the
superintendent's relations with donors.
:::

::: class-0
However, inmates would use their ingenuity to cobble a ball together
from rags, or smuggle one in on court dates to enjoy a good game of
cricket with a wooden bat broken off from a ceiling plank. And when
there was a match broadcast on television, cricket fever would bite the
whole prison, including staff and officers. Every inmate would be in his
barrack, glued to the set. The yards would be empty which seldom
happened during the day. In the gunahkhaana, the live commentary would
be blasted on the radio. I too was compelled to participate in this
craze, since the radio was placed in front of my cell.

In November 2009, Sridhar Srinivasan and Vernon Gonsalves were
transferred from Mumbai's Arthur Road Prison to our yard in Nagpur. They
had been arrested in Mumbai by the Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) in August
2007. Like me, they had been booked under the Unlawful Activities
(Prevention) Act and Arms Act. However, in their case, the ATS was more
generous in planting evidence and claimed to have seized a huge cache of
explosives and arms from them. They were transferred to Nagpur on the
orders of the Gondia Court. As they were implicated as my co-accused in
two cases in Gondia relating to serious charges of arson and murder, our
lawyer had applied for them to be transferred to Nagpur so that our
cases could be speeded up. They too were residents of Mumbai and
well-known activists. We had been communicating by post. Now, being in
the same yard gave us the opportunity to catch up and exchange
experiences.
:::

::: class-0
Apart from our common experience of arrest, torture and cumbersome
litigation, both Srinivasan and Gonsalves, with almost four decades of
political experience, had a lot to share. They had become activists in
their college days, during the
post-Emergency mass struggles in the 1970s and later also became
involved in working-class movements. The state could no longer tolerate
their dreams of a classless and oppression-free society and had put them
in prison. I enjoyed debating contemporary events with both and they,
with their warm approach and Marxist acumen, were ever obliging.
:::

::: class-0
Other inmates would easily fail to differentiate between them as they
were both tall, had grey hair, glasses, often wore similar styles of
clothes on court dates and were always willing to offer legal help.
Inmates began referring to both of them as Vakil Uncle. Sridhar and
Vernon had been implicated in more than twenty Naxal-related cases in
Gondia, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur. Prolonged incarceration, repeated
trips to the court, a poor prison diet and lack of proper medical
supplements were gradually affecting their health. Nevertheless, they
never gave up their daily exercise, selfless service to others and
eagerly participated in every prison struggle, including hunger strikes.
Despite the government's attempts to quell their spirit , both vakil
uncles remained a source of courage and inspiration for many.

My acquittal on 17 December 2009 in the Nagpur case, for which I'd first
been arrested, was great news for my family and friends. That case was
the foundation of the government's charges against me. The books, pen
drives and 'seditious' literature allegedly seized from me could have
easily been misinterpreted by the judiciary to convict me. The result of
this case would have a bearing on my other cases. This acquittal
signalled the beginning of the end. Hope was resurrected and time-frames
of possible release calculated. But most of all, the verdict helped in
rebuilding trust with my family that had been strained since I'd been
arrested in May 2007. I could sense a change in the mood both at home

Immediately after my acquittal in the Nagpur case, I applied for bail in
the Chandrapur one. My bail application was not heard for almost a month
due to the examination of witnesses, and when it was ultimately heard
the prosecution opposed it. It was rejected in the Trial Court. I
appealed in the High Court, but in July 2010 it was rejected there too.
Seven months of unsuccessful litigation
since December 2009, just for one bail application. In the Gondia cases,
developments unfolded excruciatingly slowly. In July 2009, I had managed
to get an acquittal in one of the six cases there. However proceedings
in the other cases had come to a standstill because my co-accused,
Sridhar and Vernon, had been in Mumbai.

Later, with them getting transferred to Nagpur, things once again
started picking up. In the Gondia cases, as most of the crimes dealt
with attacks on the police, the witnesses were by and large from their
staff. The court would have to repeatedly summon them as they regularly
missed dates for testifying, delaying the entire trial as a result. It
was only when the judge started getting serious that the examination of
witnesses started. Then, by August 2010, I got another two acquittals in
Gondia.

In 2010, the government was planning to introduce a Prevention of
Torture Bill in Parliament. I had read it earlier and thought of
critiquing it as part of my project work for the Human Rights course.
But fear that such a bill would be legislated compelled me to quicken my
study. The government had a sense of urgency too. Although it had signed
the United Nations Convention Against Torture, 1997, it had failed to
ratify it. It also failed to amend the prevailing laws, as obligated by
the Convention. However, the proposed legislation was nothing but an
eyewash. It diluted the definition of torture in terms of meaning, scope
and the punishment for it. It implicitly condoned torture in
terrorist-related cases by claiming that it would not apply when the
victims of torture were covered by special laws such as the Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act. Someone like me would not be able to invoke
it. This proposed legislation needed a larger debate, especially by
civil rights groups, before it was passed.

In prison, help from the outside is a luxury. It's difficult even to
obtain dedicated legal aid from lawyers. Though prison rules allowed our
lawyers to visit us, without any restriction on the number of visits per
week, we still had to follow the mulakaat practice of talking to them
from behind a wire-mesh. This was a major
obstacle when we needed to read legal documents. Another problem was
that we had no way of communicating with our lawyer if something came up
urgently. We could not inform them about a sudden call for police
custody in a newly applied case or of incidents of violence in prison,
though it is a constitutionally guaranteed right to be allowed access to
legal counsel. Other states allow prisoners to make phone calls in
emergencies, but the Maharashtra government was still procrastinating on
it. At such desperate times, other undertrials were always willing to
help. They would, on their way to court, courier a note to our lawyer,
or if necessary give him a call for an urgent mulakaat.

On one of those evenings in solitude, when I could not do anymore
reading or writing, I casually sketched a scene of Ganesh, the nai
kamaan at work in our yard. The following morning, Sridhar, Shyamlal,
Vernon and other political prisoners of the yard were thrilled to see my
work. They urged me to do some more and suggested that a series of such
illustrations would give a true picture of prison life to those outside.
I too got excited with this project, which we referred to as 'Colours of
the Cage'. I started taking it up as my daily evening engagement. With
each new illustration, I got more suggestions and was further enthused.
This passion continued for a few months and I sketched over forty such
illustrations. However, keeping the illustrations safe in prison was
always a challenge. A sudden search by the staff would surely result in
them being confiscated. The administration would not appreciate
unsolicited prison images of their violations being brought to public
attention.

At home, my illustrations had an unexpected effect on my mother. She got
depressed on seeing the life I was experiencing, which till then I had

[I recently read a book titled 'Superfreakonomics'. I am sure you have
already heard about it. It's a sequel to the earlier 'Freakonomics'. I
liked it a lot. At the moment there is lots of talk of the transfers of
the prison officers and staff. The Inspector General has issued a list.
Hence a lot of our present jailers and guards may get transferred.
Everybody is doing their own estimations of the possibilities in the
Nagpur prison. Some are even trying to alter their transfers by
influence or money. We may get a new superintendent in this process.
Next will be the transfers of IPS officers in the state. Such transfers
had never caught my attention before entering prison. However now being
constantly at the receiving end of these guys' policies one starts
noticing the change in an individual's influence and thus starts
estimating the probable policy changes.]
:::

::: cont-0
Prior information of officers' transfers was crucial to predicting our
treatment in prison and was often the subject of discussion. Due to
archaic prison rules, the subjective whims of prison officials ruled our
lives, as I have shown throughout the course of this narrative. The
power of these officials permeated every aspect of our lives. For
instance, only the jailer of the yard could permit an inmate to write
more than the single letter per month stipulated in the Manual. These
discretionary powers made daily life in
prison extremely arbitrary. While one jailer would allow a visit to the
library, another would ask for the Superintendent's permission to be
obtained. While one would allow books and magazines to arrive by post,
the other would not. The same went for the Superintendent of the prison.
While one Superintendent encouraged me to pursue academics, his
replacement created numerous obstacles. Hence, a reasonable officer on
duty was an essential condition for a relatively peaceful incarceration.
Transfers of officers would always upset this status quo and force one
to get attuned to the desires and tastes of the new man.
:::

::: class-0
The new jailer assigned to our yard in place of Taksande was a young man
who was very soon nicknamed Dabangg. Like the Bollywood character he was
named after, this officer regularly trotted around the yard with his
sleeves rolled up, swinging his baton. This became even more pronounced
if a female jail employee or inmate was in sight. Dabangg would, at the
slightest opportunity to prop up his macho image, immediately move into
action and pounce fiercely on the nearest hapless victim. This would
also be with an eye on making a quick buck from those concerned. A
mobile phone unearthed, contraband seized, an urgent message to be
passed on or cash to be received meant that Dabangg would collect
protection money from all those concerned.
:::

::: class-0
If someone needed to be taught a lesson in discipline, Dabangg would not
hesitate to unleash his belt. His style of quick action and apparent
justice through such dealings made him popular with many inmates,
especially the ones who could pay. Each jailer has his own set of
cronies, inmates who would do the deals for extracting money from the
victim. When a particular jailer ruled, his cronies had a free hand.
Officers' transfers realigned and disturbed these relations too.

[The news of matchfixing has once again cropped up with the Scotland
Yard cops arresting Pakistani cricketers. Even in the run-up to the
Commonwealth Games many players have begun failing the dope tests.
Competition in sport, in this world dominated by money and power, is
bound to lead to such episodes. This is only the tip of the iceberg. One
of the dons in prison puts it interestingly: 'Everyone does corruption,
but it is only the ones who get caught who are called
corrupt.']
:::

::: cont-0
For the common inmate, corruption lubricated the inefficient and
oppressive prison system. Essentials such as tea leaves for chai after
bandi or oil for handi had to be obtained by corrupt means. To obtain
cash in jail, your well-wisher outside would have to pay the go-between
twice or thrice its face value. Even a cigarette could be purchased
through a guard and sold in prison at multiples of its original price.
Mobile phones, narcotics and other serious contraband require a more
expensive and complicated transaction. The 'carrier', an inmate or
guard, would have to be paid, the guards or staff at the gates where the
carrier brought it in would have to be managed, and finally an officer
would have to be given a monthly sum so that the phone could be used.
:::

::: class-0
Prison guards took money to perform errands, the jailer would make his
pile by providing facilities like bedding space,
medical treatment or a jhadati-free stay.
The higher-ups also had their own methods of feathering their nests,
like doctoring invoices or by sanctioning the transfers of prison
guards. With absolutely no transparency or protest from the affected
consumers, prison corruption was much more rampant and severe than in
the outside world. In some instances, the whole hierarchy was involved,
with everyone receiving their share. But if by chance the news of a scam
became public, everyone had to fend for themselves. Corruption was one
of the most common reasons for prison officials or staff being
suspended, even though the actual number of incidents of corruption
being exposed was extremely small. The responsibility was easily fixed
on the lowest ranking prison guard or an inmate.
:::

::: class-0
The prison administration had an absurd way of dealing with corruption.
Whenever corruption was unearthed, the service in question was
dismantled or curtailed. Inmates, the beneficiaries of the service,
would suffer for the corruption of the officials. This was the case with
the canteen services and the factory department. In 2009, the Inspector
General issued orders to put an end to the almost half-a-century-old
practice of selling cooked food by the prison canteen. Weekly
non-vegetarian delights sold by the canteen were abruptly stopped.
Although Prison Manual rules were cited, the underlying reasoning given
was the pilferage of ingredients by staff. Similarly, the factory
departments such as carpentry, weaving, tailoring, bakery and
shoe-making, meant for training convicts in vocational skills, were
gradually dismantled over the years. Even minimal purchases of raw
materials could not be done without the sanction of high-ranking prison
officials, as it was held that the lower-level staff were corrupt. This
resulted in delayed purchases, idle machines and no training offered to
convicts. No service was provided and
corruption was assumed to have been eliminated. Why not then dismantle
the entire prison system? It is horribly riddled with corruption too.

[The question of the police rearresting me after acquittal is definitely
a fear that I too face. This is the horrible apprehension that every

measures so as to reduce its probability. This year rains have been
continuous. One of the guys in our yard has got conjunctivitis. Hope I
don't get it. In the separate (cellular yard) we are relatively lucky.
In overcrowded general barracks on the other hand, the situation is
horrible.]
:::

::: cont-0
The problem of overcrowding affects a prisoner's entire life, since it
overloads water resources, latrines, sanitation and ventilation. The
Prison Manual defines the minimum space allotted to a prisoner in a
barrack as '3.71 sq. metres and 15.83 cu. metres'. However in practice,
it is normal for three inmates to sleep in the space meant for one. With
such overcrowding as well as a noticeable lack of hygiene, contagious
diseases have a free run in the barrack. Often, at the tanki, with
everyone stripped to their underwear, one
could easily observe all inmates of the same barrack having developed
scabies or the same body rash.
:::

::: class-0
In October 2010, due to overcrowding in the Chandrapur prison, around
sixty Naxal accused undertrial prisoners from there were transferred to
Nagpur. All of them were tribals from the interiors of Gadchiroli. With
their arrival, I became rather busy. Work expanded to fill the time
available. Suddenly, there were always unlettered adivasis from
Gadchiroli who required help in sending applications to court, studying
their charge sheets or making points for their defence. As most of them
were too poor to pay for their own lawyers, they had to depend on the
legal aid officers provided by the government. Among such indigent
tribals was a young lady, seven months pregnant, who soon after arrival,
had been admitted to hospital due to weakness. She later gave birth to a
healthy boy in the prison hospital, whom the women inmates appropriately
named Azad. Though he had committed no crime, Azad became a prisoner
too, and would remain one until his mother was freed.

impossible to answer the exam in a hall in the city with a dozen armed

Examinations are usually conducted by the administration in the prison
hall, otherwise used for cultural activities. Examinations for inmates
are routinely conducted for graduation courses in the arts from an open
university. As part of my course, I had to prepare a couple of reports
and a thesis. My restricted mobility left me with no option other than
choosing issues that were related to prison life. I prepared my field
report on 'The State of Human Rights in Maharashtra Prisons', discussing
the violation of prisoners' rights in matters like accommodation,
bedding, clothing, diet, communication with
advocates, family and friends, newspapers, library, sports, recreation,
entertainment, production before courts, medical facilities, discipline
and so on. My case study report was on the practice of rearrest, titled
'Where arrests follow acquittals', while my master's thesis was on
'Political Prisoners in India'.

Concluding my thesis, my recommendations included: 'The recognition of
political prisoners; treatment of all prisoners in accordance with
internationally recognized principles, standards and conventions;
arrested combatants of armed resistance movements to be recognized,
declared as prisoners of war and be treated in accordance with the
Geneva Convention; withdrawal of the colonial-era Indian Prisons Act;
repeal of special and extraordinary laws such as the Armed Forces
Special Powers Act, National Security Act, Unlawful Activities

Nagpur, almost all the 800-odd lifers (convicts undergoing life
imprisonment) went on hunger strike demanding liberal rules for
premature release. We too supported them. Hence there has been a long
line of dignitaries visiting the prison. First the Additional Director
General of Prisons visited the jail. He is the senior-most officer
in-charge of the prisons throughout the state (below the Home Ministry).
After him, the state Home Minister arrived yesterday. As expected the
entire jail administration were on their toes. He was supposed to tour
all the barracks but ultimately made it a point only to visit the
barrack which lodged a corporator of his political party. All this
happened of course by chance! And now a day after their visits the
entire prison has gone into a virtual sleep mode. The sigh of relief,

Maharashtra has more prisons than any other Indian state, followed by
Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The Additional Director General of
Prisons at Yerawada, Pune, is responsible for them. The prison
administration is divided into three geographical regions: Western
Region, Central Region and Eastern Region. The Nagpur Central Prison
comes within the Eastern Region and is the office of its regional head,
the Deputy Inspector General. The DIG,
Eastern Region, is responsible for the transfers of prison guards within
this zone, an exercise that usually takes place once in seven years.
Guards and even jailers often mention the price they must pay if they
want to be transferred to prisons of their choice or if they want to be
moved before their term is finished. The Nagpur prison is proud of its
ISO 9001: 2000 certification. Apparently the first yardstick for
measuring the bureaucrat's ISO quality is adherence to the colonial
Prison Manual.
:::

::: class-0
The prison department along with the police is governed by the state
Home Ministry. In 2006, the government set up an enquiry commission for
Maharashtra State Jail Administration and Jail Manual Reform headed by
Justice S. P. Kurdurkar. It even sought suggestions from us inmates,
which we sent. Some prison officers were keen that criticisms of the
higher-ups, which figured in most of our points should go to the
commission. They themselves could not imagine raising such things as it
would be looked on as an act of insubordination. However, after the
26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai, the state Home Ministry reconsidered its
priorities, and prison reform was clearly not among them. Among the
structural problems to reform is the fact that the police and prison
administrations are both controlled by the Home Ministry, which
naturally treats the prison department as an instrument of law and order
instead of reform. The government did not sanction a further extension
of the commission and it wound up without presenting a report.
:::

::: class-0
India's prison policies are security-centric, rather than correctional.
The state's priority is to tighten restrictions rather than to upgrade
facilities for prisoners. While a broken yard wall would be repaired
overnight, it would take three to four months to fix a damaged water
pump---and then only if prompted by a
couple of hunger strikes. Similarly, laws are passed to make sentences
harsher and longer rather than protecting prisoner's rights, and funds
are allocated for building more secure prisons, rather than improving
the quality of existing ones.
:::

::: class-0
Another hurdle in prison reform is that the higher echelons of the
administration are staffed by officers from the Indian Police Service,
who do short-term stints in the corrections department. However, they
retain their law and order mindset in their new roles. Their approach is
mainly to imprison troublemakers rather than seeking to rehabilitate
them.

with him on the way back too. He was so scared and petrified to get us
back to prison, that he did not stop even for a urinal break on the way
back, despite repeated pleas from the rest of his staff. He was terribly
frightened that our van would be attacked and we would be abducted by
'Naxalites'. One gets to meet all sorts of characters in this
experience.

::: noindent-0
Trips to court were events to which every undertrial looked forward.
They helped break the monotony of jail life and offered the opportunity
to meet one's family and friends. Most important, they let you find out
how far your trial had progressed. The few moments an undertrial managed
to get with his wife or child would charge him up for another fortnight
until the next court date. On the way back from the Nagpur Court, the
police van would be packed but that would not undermine the mood. Each
undertrial would share the snacks he had received from his family. Naxal
undertrials like us were prohibited from receiving food from the family.
The escorting police team would be made to sign an undertaking to ensure
that we were not given anything to eat in court. However, on our journey
back fellow inmates in the vehicle always provided us a bite.
:::

::: class-0
But like everything in jail, it took a struggle to squeeze out such
pleasures. The Nagpur police continued the practice of handcuffing and
fettering undertrials to the court and back, despite Supreme Court
directives to the contrary. It took arming ourselves with a copy of
these judgments and some fiery arguments to
ensure that we would not be handcuffed. Similarly, in the court
premises, there would always be some officers who would object if we
tried to speak to our family or lawyers. Some officers would even
prevent our families from attending the court, a clear violation of the
law. In the initial years, trips to the Gondia and Chandrapur courts
would become extremely disappointing and tiring as my family could not
come there and my case wasn't making any progress. The only saving grace
was the opportunity to chat with the prisoners from other barracks
through the journey as it helped break our isolation.

In January 2011, Dalit writer and cultural activist Sudhir Dhavale was
arrested by the Gondia police after he addressed a literary convention
at Wardha. Sudhir, a 42-year-old resident of Mumbai, was one of the
founding members of the Republican Panthers, an organization fighting
for caste eradication in the tradition of the Dalit Panther movement. He
was charged by the Gondia cops under the provisions of the Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act and for waging war against the state. After
his time in police custody, Sudhir was brought to our prison and
classified as a Naxal undertrial.
:::

::: class-0
I had known Dhavale since my college days. He had always been a vibrant
and committed political activist sensitive to the issues of caste
oppression. He saw the emancipation of Dalits in the revolutionary
transformation of society. From a reading of his charge sheet, I
observed that the charges against Sudhir were essentially regarding his
authoring and possession of books related to the Maoist movement. As
evidence, the police claimed to have seized from his residence a 'Free
Dr. Binayak Sen' pamphlet, a charge sheet of one of my cases and books
authored by him in Marathi. Although Sudhir published and sold these
books legally in Mumbai and the rest of the state, the police booked him
in a case in Gondia, more than 1,000 km away. Sudhir's arrest did not go
without protest. Many socialists, Ambedkarites, communists, trade
unionists, cultural activists, writers and intellectuals of Maharashtra,
all united to demand his immediate release.
:::

::: class-0
However the state was getting increasingly thick-skinned. Political
activists like Sudhir, Ashok, Sridhar and Vernon were a threat. They
exposed the government's anti-poor policies and incited rebellion among
the masses. This, the state claimed, was hurting the conducive climate
needed to spur investment and the growth of
the elite. The armed Maoist movement had to be crushed, regardless of
tribal casualties, as its presence prevented the occupation and
exploitation of forestland rich in mineral deposits. In the Surjagarh
area of Gadchiroli, for instance, steel companies had obtained blocks
for extracting huge deposits of iron ore, but Maoist resistance had
prevented the mining from beginning. These were conditions that prompted
the government to launch Operation Green Hunt, a military offensive
against the Naxalites. As a consequence, in the preceding four years,
the number of Naxal undertrials in Vidarbha, including tribals of Gondia
and Gadchiroli, had quadrupled to almost 120.
:::

::: class-0
As I realized in Nagpur, the majority of the inmates, whether they were
alleged Naxalites or not, didn't fit any recognizable definition of
criminal. They had landed in jail either because they had been falsely
implicated by the police or because of an action committed in a fit of
anger, often during a family feud. Not being professionals, they had
been convicted due to poor legal advice.
:::

::: class-0
They faced the task of coming to terms with a life they simply hadn't
imagined. After the initial shock of conviction, they had to stoically
reconcile themselves to living out the long years in jail---which in the

is to ensure that fact does not pierce illusion and despair is not
allowed to overcome hope. Once prisoners achieve this, it isn't really
that difficult to keep going.

As an undertrial, you tell yourself that the trial's going well, that
since all witnesses have failed, you are bound to be acquitted. If you
have been convicted, you pin your hopes on the verdict being reversed by
the higher courts. In this, the endemic delays of the Indian judicial
system are a real blessing. Hope remains alive till your case reaches
the Supreme Court, by which time you have reached what you feel should
be the end of your sentence anyway. After that, there are remissions and
pardons to look forward to.
:::

::: class-0
You enter that bewildered yet hope-filled period of waiting for your
likhaan to be finalised. Likhaan is the colloquial term for the review
file prepared by the Jail Judicial Department for every long-sentence
convict. The likhaan file reports on the prisoner's conduct in jail and
contains calculations of the set-offs for which he is eligible. It also
contains the recommendations of the jail, police and administrative
authorities. This document is sent to the state government for reviewing
prisoners' sentences and to obtain premature release. A prisoner usually
gets seven days of pardon for every month of his sentence served in
jail. Prisoners with life sentences, for instance, are eligible for such
mafi and it would be set-off from the prisoner's sentence. The lifer
could be prematurely released after 14, 16, 18 or more years in jail.
But this pardon is dependent upon his conduct in prison and the nature
of his offence. Political prisoners in Maharashta are those who are
least likely to be pardoned, regardless of their conduct, and often have
to spend between 30 and 60 years in prison.
:::

::: class-0
However, as the government's rules for premature release are so
complicated, it is rare for any prisoner to be able to estimate what
kind of likhaan he will finally get. It takes years for the bureaucrats
at the state headquarters in Mumbai to decide. It is only then that you
have some idea of when you can expect to be finally released. This
starts your ulti ginthi---the countdown, as you tick off the days
remaining for you to go home. Throughout all this, as you battle to
maintain your balance. The abiding symbol of hope and despair is the Lal
Gate, the red exit gate. It makes an appearance in rhetoric, in small
talk, in jokes and in your dreams. It is the barrier that holds you in
and the portal that will lead you out. The secret is to ignore the
barricade and only see the door. That helps maintain some semblance of
sanity.
:::

::: class-0
But for some, the long years of prison life pass without the slightest
contact or communication with the outside world. Poverty prevents them
from even finding anyone with enough money to put for the surety the
state demands for sending a prisoner on furlough or parole. Besides,
many families can't afford the expense of travelling to jail for the
monthly mulakaat. Illiteracy or the breakdown of family relations could
mean that there won't even be a letter. As the lonely years stretch on,
the line separating these prisoners from insanity steadily blurs.
:::

Sixty-five-year-old Kithulal was among the victims of such
circumstances. His lean, muscular body and hardened palms spoke of a
life of toil as a farm labourer, while his long grey hair and feminine
gait reflected the community of dancers he came from. He had been
convicted for the murder of a small boy who died by accidentally
consuming the pesticide Kithulal used for his crops. Kithulal could not
afford a proper defence, and now he was denied contact with his family,
who lived about 300 km away in another
state. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. He would cheat time to
give himself hope. He would manage to convince himself that he'd almost
done his time and that the benevolent government would be soon
announcing a special remission that would see him out of jail. The three
or four months before each Republic Day and Independence Day were
periods of carefully cultivated hope because he believed that the
government would announce an extraordinary reprieve and he would be
walking out of the Lal Gate on the great day. As the day came and went,
despair would choke his normal loquacity.
:::

::: class-0
He'd then resort to other devices. He would get absorbed in a flurry of
apparently irrational activity, as if sweat expended in sufficient
quantities could wash away the pain. The normal opiate of fasts and
other religious rituals would take on larger dimensions. In a short
time, he'd be pinning his hopes on his next release date.
:::

::: class-0
In a place dominated by a few professional felons, Kithulal would put on
a show of villainy. At the slightest provocation, he would let loose a
loud string of abuse. This amused the professionals. Like kids attacking
the a village madman, they'd pelt him with pebbles or insult him,
enjoying his reaction. Watching his ranting, I couldn't help but wonder
about the sanity of a society that sees fit to incarcerate people like
Kithulal for 15 years or more.

Lata from the bai (women's) barrack and Sampath, Shyamlal and Fagulal
from my yard, all of whom had been arrested in Naxal cases, were
released in March 2011. They had spent over 6 years in prison. After
being released in an initial batch of cases, they had been rearrested in
2009. The court had granted them bail but they were unable to take
advantage of the order because they were too poor to raise the money. So
they were left with no other option but to be put on trial, which
ultimately took more than two years. They too were clients of my lawyer
and I had known them since I was imprisoned. All the three boys learnt
to read and write in prison. I had been teaching Sampath and Fagulal
English and Maths since 2008 and Asghar of the phasi yard had taught
Shyamlal. Due to their long incarceration and
cheerful behaviour, they were also popular
with the prisoners and jail staff. The day after they had walked free,
we read in the newspapers that they had been rearrested. Luckily, this
turned out to be false. Their release was an extremely emotional time
for all of us in the yard. It was a sorrowful yet joyous separation.

In April 2011, the Supreme Court granted bail to Binayak Sen, a
paediatrician and human rights activist. He was arrested in Raipur in
2007, a week after my arrest, and similarly charged under UAPA and
sedition for allegedly abetting Maoists. An international campaign had
called for his release, but Binayak was convicted and sentenced to life.
Subsequently, the Supreme Court had granted him bail pending his appeal
against conviction. For us, political prisoners it was proof that the
charges levelled against us were false.
:::

::: class-0
The Supreme Court made noteworthy observations while granting Binayak
bail: 'If Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography is found in somebody's place,
is he a Gandhian? No case of sedition is made out on the basis of
materials in possession unless you show that he was actively helping or
harbouring Maoists.'
:::

::: class-0
We assumed that such a remark would pave the way for bail for hundreds
of other political prisoners incarcerated on similar charges.
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court did not mention these observations in
its written order and hence it could not become a legal precedent.
However, the 'Free Binayak Sen Campaign' brought back the issue of
political prisoners into the mainstream media and gave a boost to the
civil liberties movement in India.

[After the last court date did not materialize, I finally picked up a
500+ page novel 'Depths' written by Henning Mankell. The novel is based
on a Swedish Navy officer who mapped ocean depths just prior to the
First World War. This fictitious character, being mentally sick, pursued
adulterous relationships and in the process failed to fathom his own
emptiness, finally committing suicide. This author is Swedish. He was,
5-6 months ago, part of a flotilla bound for the Gaza Strip which was
later captured by the Israeli authorities. Henning Mankell and other
European intelligentsia had undertaken this voyage as support for their
struggle of the Palestinian people. Mentioning the Palestinian struggle,
you may have heard the good news. The radical Hamas has entered into a
unity process with the moderate Fatah faction. It's not yet clear how
and why such a unity emerged especially after the various Arab revolts,
but nevertheless it is great news and has already frightened the
American-backed Israeli ruling classes.]
:::

::: cont-0
I regularly discussed the Palestinian question with Abbas Mohammed Ali
Shahadi, a convict-warder. He was in charge of the danda kamaan and
would regularly enter the phasi yard during the cleaning of the toilets
for a game of carom or volleyball or to catch BBC Arabia on our yard
radio. Abbas, a patriotic Palestinian, had
been arrested in 1998 in a case involving an attack on an Italian pilot
at the Mumbai airport. The Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a breakaway
Palestinian faction, had initially planned to target an American. But
the teenager Abbas ended up shooting at an Italian instead. The Italian
survived the attack and Abbas was arrested carrying a machine gun,
around 75 live rounds and two grenades. Stories of his experience in
jail had all of us enthralled. During the initial years, his hands and
feet had been kept shackled throughout the day and it was several years
before he was let out of solitary confinement.
:::

::: class-0
Abbas was convicted to a life sentence and after 21 years with
remissions, was due to be released in 2009. As his date came nearer, he
became ever more restless. His future was uncertain because it wasn't
clear that his homeland would accept him. If the Indian government could
not deport him, he would be kept in a police lock-up. Fearing this, he
regularly made me draft applications to his consulate, the Human Rights
Commission and the courts. He even contemplated carrying a copy of
Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography on the date of his release to impress
upon the police his change of heart. After being released in October
2009, Abbas finally managed only a few months in a lock-up before being
united with his sister and ageing father in Jordan. Such stories always
brought hope to even the most disheartened in the prison.

Experiencing the dry and scorching Vidarbha summers in prison was a
topic that often dominated my letters. Temperatures could go up to 49
˚C, as they did in the summer of 2009. Even the electric fans installed
four years after I'd been imprisoned merely swirled hot air around us.
The switches for both the lights and the fans were placed outside the
cell so before bandi, we had to decide whether to use the fan and if so,
at what speed. In the cell, the floor got really hot and any attempt to
lie on it caused great perspiration. At dawn, ants would climb over me
to feed on the salt that had caked my torso and the bedding. I'd wake up
every day at about 4 a.m. to their tickle. In the evening
we'd have to sprinkle water on the floor to
cool the floor. The water situation in the prison was aggravated in the
summer. In some barracks the inmates would have to fill drums with water
and carry them to their barracks on the first floor. This would take two
or three hours every day. Attending to basic needs consumed most of our
time in prison.
:::

::: class-0
The monsoons and winters brought other challenges. With the onset of the
rains, our ceilings would start dripping and the walls and floors
sweating due to water seepage. Each day, with the discovery of every new
drip, we'd have to secure a new place for our bedding, books and
clothing within the limited confines of the cell. In winter,
temperatures would often drop to 6 ºC at night, making the cold
unbearable. A freezing draft would enter the cell. I had only a single
blanket to cover myself with and another to lie on. The only option was
to wear multiple layers of clothing. Blankets were in short supply. We
once tried to tie old blankets on the cell bars to stop the draft, but
the superintendent ordered them to be pulled down. I wonder whether the
officials would be able to survive in the conditions they imposed on us.
More likely, this was just a way of reminding us inmates who was the
boss.

America's Islamophobic policy was a topic Salaam, a senior convict,
enjoyed discussing with us when he'd come daily to our yard for a bath.
His wisdom was built from years of reading literature while working as a
typesetter in a printing press in Chandrapur. Salaam was convicted to
life imprisonment for a murder he never spoke about and details of which
I could never bring myself to ask him. Now, as a warder, convict
overseer, he was in charge of distributing the letters and money orders
we'd receive by post. The mail would be delivered at the prison gate by
the afternoon and it was 60-year-old Salaam's job to collect it, inform
the prisoner concerned, acquire his signature
and present him before the jailer for the
letter to be censored.
:::

::: class-0
In the case of money orders Salaam had to acquire the prisoner's
signature before depositing the receipt back with the gate jailer, who
would then enter the amount in the prisoner's account. This job meant
knowing every prisoner and their barrack and Salaam was extremely
efficient at it. While others would have to shout the name of the
concerned inmate, Salaam would do this with the least effort, like a
true dakiya. Suddenly he'd be near you, wherever you were in prison,
peering over his reading glasses to inform you about your letter. Before
bandi, we'd often eagerly look out for him, because to sight Salaam
meant a letter had arrived. He was finally released in 2011, after

The rains have picked up here too. We experienced continuous showers for
the past 4-5 days. The water levels in the prison wells have risen and
hence the water problem has been solved, until the next summer of
course. The Mumbai bomb blasts were horrible as you rightly said---too
many innocents killed. Gujaratis were especially targeted. However in
prison I have had the opportunity of interacting with some guys who
believe such blasts to be correct. They cite the events of the 2002
Gujarat riots, where innocents of the Muslim community were targeted,
raped and killed. They incorrectly blame the majority Gujarati community
for such crimes against humanity. By doing so, they fail to see the role
of the rulers who engineered these riots as part of their policies of
divide and rule. They thus fall into the very trap created by the real
perpetrators. Though their anger and want for revenge is reasonable and
justified, their methods are misplaced. The State too has horribly
failed in protecting their lives. While the major players of the Gujarat
riots roam scot-free, the most devoted of the Muslim youth are arrested
and made to rot in jail.

In July 2011, three young eunuchs Sonia, Sapna and Saloni, accused of a
murder were brought into our yard. The prison authorities could not send
them to the women's barrack nor keep them
in a general barrack lest their presence provoked sexual attacks on
them. The anda barrack, phasi yard or similar cellular confinements like
ours were the only option. These cells are out of bounds for the other
prisoners, but we soon had a steady stream of visitors from the other
barracks---they had devised some excuse or the other to enter and catch
a glimpse of the new entrants. As my cell was before theirs, many would
stare or make a pass at me assuming from my clean-shaven face that I was
one of the eunuchs they were searching for. Angered by this, I even
contemplated growing a moustache. Suddenly our yard which was earlier
inhabited mainly by us political prisoners became the centre of
attraction for all inmates. For us too it was a learning experience---we
soon made friends and, as the three got talking, we gained first-hand
knowledge of the severe stress and strain that society imposes on the
LGBTQ community. Such strain increased manifold in jail. They had landed
here after a quarrel that began when they were soliciting alms in a
train turned horribly wrong and one passenger was killed. Denied bail,
they had to spend 18 months in prison as undertrials, before they were
acquitted and walked free.

Somehow my last Chandrapur trial proved to be a test for my nerves. It
was the case where I had been implicated with the youth of the
Deshbhakti Yuva Manch. A case designed to resemble those grand
conspiracy cases of the British Raj and proving to be equally messy. I
would grow anxious as this last court date neared. In October 2010, I
had court dates on every alternate day. I expected my acquittal and
release by December 2010. An unexpected bonus was that my co-accused,
local students from Chandrapur, would manage to treat me to delicacies
unavailable in prison. One day it would be homemade mutton masala, on
another it would be sweet-pumpkin pakodas 
or egg masala. A series of such consecutive dates invariably gave me a
stomach upset. Eating the same insipid food in prison had made my
intestines sensitive to rich and spicy food. Not that I cared.

Then suddenly for the next two to three months, the pace slowed down.
The judge went on vacation and witnesses were not turning up. In March
2011, the Nagpur police stopped escorting us to court. Was it better
that we were not compelled to undergo the 8-hour long journey in the
scorching sun when nothing was happening in court? Police personnel
informed us that our court dates had ceased because the government had
not sanctioned a diesel allowance for the escort vehicles. The official
story, though, was that guards were not available due to security
concerns.
:::

::: class-0
When we began to be taken to court again in May 2011, another delay
arose. After the trial had proceeded for nearly four years, the judge
decided to add another recently arrested person who was wanted in the
case to our trial, thus making way for his trial to be heard with ours.
This would mean that although witness examination in our trial had
concluded, it would have to start afresh. My lawyers and I fiercely
resisted this move. I took the opportunity to speak in court and explain
to the judge how this was a method regularly used by the prosecution in
nearly all my cases. The police would show a list of nearly
sixty-seventy accused, delay their arrest and when arrested, propose
that they be added to the trial. Each addition of an accused person to
the trial delays the trial. The cops would deliberately use this
strategy to incarcerate us indefinitely.
:::

::: class-0
The judge was soon convinced. Then in July 2011, we stopped being taken
to court once again. Police bandobast had been increased in the city due
to communal unrest and both police
personnel and the vans for our transportation to the court were
diverted. The case was stalled again. It wasn't until 18 August that the
judge finally recorded our statements. The arguments of the prosecution
and the defence soon followed. This roller coaster case would have
concluded in August but then the judge went on vacation. I was confident
about being acquitted. It was the delays that made me anxious.

There is a 'prison-release routine' or rather tradition that every
inmate follows religiously as his day of release approaches. I would
anxiously wait to hear my name called out by the convict warder assigned
this duty. As soon as the barracks opened, I'd wait for him to appear.
All morning ablutions and meals had to be planned so that I wouldn't
miss his call. When I saw him, I'd try to read his lips, in case he was
too far away for me to hear his yell. Once
my name was called, another process would begin---meeting inmates and
exchanging hugs with all who had been friends and 'family' all through
my period of incarceration. As I started to gather my belongings,
another set of inmates would crowd the doorway---the type who wanted to
lay their hands on my belongings. There is a prison superstition around
this routine: it holds that all clothes worn in prison should be left
behind or else bad luck will follow. One was expected to walk out in a
new set of clothes. Still, though habitual offenders followed this
practice rigorously, it could not guarantee that they would not return a
few months later. Thereafter, I would be given a meal and sent off to
the judiciary department of the prison for release.

mind was probably preparing itself for life on the outside. I started
making plans for the future. On 24 September 2011, the Chandrapur court
finally dismissed the last of the nine cases against me. Immediately
after the order, I managed to phone my wife using a friendly police
officer's mobile. She appeared shocked to hear my voice on the phone

brother and advocates, who had come to receive me, were pushed out of

anxieties by informing them or my advocates about my whereabouts. They
refused, despite having mobile phones on which they were receiving
repeated instructions from their seniors. After about three hours, I was
taken to a police station in Gadchiroli district.
:::

::: class-0
The police rearrested me in two more cases related to Naxalite attacks
in 2007 and I came to know my abductors were policemen of the C-60, the
elite commando force involved in anti-Naxal operations in the Gondia and
Gadchiroli districts. I was once again produced before a magistrate, who
granted the police custody despite my complaining about my abduction and
rearrest. After five days in Wadsa Desaiganj, Gadchiroli, I was sent
back to the Nagpur prison. My old companions in the gunahkhaana had come
out to the Badi Gol gate to receive me. Each of them hugged me and
helped me settle back into my old cell,
filling me in on the details of reports of my rearrest that had appeared
in the newspapers. I was crushed at the thought of having to run through
the same cycle of torture, bail applications and waiting endlessly for
trial dates.

[Hi, the tiger ultimately bared its fangs, I guess!! Or rather the true
face of Indian democracy. All through the journey after I was rearrested
from the prison gates I kept wondering about what you two would be going
through. Though I was mentally expecting this, I nevertheless kept
hoping against it. Hoping that I would be able to join you. Guess such
dreams and plans will get postponed. But however hard they may try it
will definitely happen one day. I came back into prison on the
3][rd][at around 4.30 p.m. I received tremendous
support and sympathy from everyone---inmates and lower-level staff
included. All have offered some suggestions, help and instilled hope. In
fact, throughout this entire episode it is the state which has
discredited itself and sacrificed long term interests for short term
ones. It has reduced people's confidence in the judicial
system.]
:::

::: chp4-1
[All inmates chipped in to make sure that my life was restored the same
as prior to my 27][th][September rearrest. I have
been given the same cell, beddings, buckets, etc. These essentials I
have been gradually accumulating throughout the past 4 ½ years (defended
and safeguarded from numerous prison jhadatis) and it would have been a
pain to start from scratch again. This was one of my major fears which
was easily solved by the love and affection of other inmates---like a
family you could say. I also heard that 125]
[inmates observed a day of hunger
strike in protest of my rearrest.]
:::

::: chp4-0
[And finally, an attempt to answer the most important question that
would have crossed your minds---how much more time to go? One thing is
sure that it wouldn't be as long as the earlier period of 4½ years. So
don't be too disheartened. The lower time limit is based on many
factors, but such would be best discussed in person rather than writing
via this censored medium. I am sure this opportunity will soon
come.]
:::

::: cont-0
My rearrest was not an exceptional act, particularly in relation to
Naxal cases in Gadchiroli district. The desire to show results and win
awards and increased funds was leading police officers in Gadchiroli
district to increase the number of persons shown to be arrested as
Naxals by detaining released prisoners at the jail gates. Many
prisoners, particularly poor tribal villagers who lacked adequate legal
defence, were abducted from jails at the time of their release with the
connivance of prison officials. In the records, the abducted people were
shown to have been arrested anew in some remote corner of the district.
:::

::: class-0
In prison, I met three tribal men from Gadchiroli named Baburao Narote,
Kejuram Pudo and Vilas Kallo who were rearrested at the jail gate every
two or three months---each time they were released. After their first
arrest from their village in Dhanora, Gadchiroli they were released on
bail in October 2011. On release, they were abducted by cops in civilian
clothing outside the Chandrapur prison but on the way to Dhanora, the
police van transporting them had a serious accident. Three other tribal
men from their village who were also rearrested were critically injured
with spinal injuries and were hospitalized for over a month. Baburam,
Kejuram and Vilas were put back in prison, this time in Nagpur, with
bruises and fractures. Within two months
they were again granted bail. But on release, they were arrested for a
third time, in December. By then, their families had run out of money to
pay for bail so the men had no choice but to reconcile themselves to a
prolonged stay in prison until the completion of their trials.
:::

::: class-0
Despite my disappointment, my rearrest had a silver lining. It brought
this obnoxious practice of the Gadchiroli police to national attention.
Newspaper headlines said, 'Is Maharashtra becoming a police state?',
'When the State Turns Abductor', and 'SC guidelines violated in arrest
of Ferreira outside Central Jail.' It brought the issue of my
incarceration back into focus. Family, friends, media persons and civil
rights activists who had campaigned for my release suddenly started
receiving overwhelming support. Civil society groups and individuals who
had earlier refused to give their overt support started coming forward.
I even became an issue for political rivals to compete on. City level
leaders of both the ruling and opposition parties made representations
to the Home Minister and Director General of Police demanding my
immediate release. By arresting me again, the credibility of the state
had taken a beating.
:::

::: class-0
This round of police custody in Gadchiroli was completely different from
my earlier experience in 2007. The police were not at all interested in
interrogating me or keeping me in custody. They merely wanted to show on
the record that I, the 'dreaded terrorist' was 'severely interrogated'
to prejudice the judiciary in ensuring that my incarceration be
formalized by due legal procedure. In fact most of my time in the
lock-up during this stretch was spent in reading a John Sandford novel.
:::

::: class-0
In October 2011, the prison administration suddenly transferred many
Naxal undertrial prisoners to Amravati, ostensibly because our numbers
were increasing. I feared that I too would
be transferred. Transfers from one jail to another are so arbitrary and
abrupt that they are a major cause of anxiety. Suddenly, you would get a
message from the judicial department of the prison that your transfer
had been decided and the police escort had arrived to take you. You were
then expected to pack up without any discussion and leave. Such
transfers were usually used by the administration to crush potential
dissent. In this particular case of Naxal undertrials being transferred
to Amravati prison, the ones who were the most vocal in raising issues
with the authorities and who had relatives in the women's barrack were
targeted. It became obvious to us that the recent hunger strike by men
and women inmates was a cause of concern for the administration. We had
collectively protested the brutal assault of Angela Sontakkay, a woman
Naxal-accused, by the prison staff.
:::

::: class-0
An analysis of the trend of these transfers brings to the fore another
hidden motive of the government. Earlier in October 2010, around sixty
Naxal-accused Gadchiroli tribals were transferred from Chandrapur to
Nagpur, a distance of more than 180 km from their villages. Then, in
October 2011, they were transferred from Nagpur to Amravati, 330 km from
their villages. In 2012, a few were transferred to Akola, more than 430
km from their homes. The government was hell-bent on severing all their
ties with their community, so as to cripple their legal defence. It
won't be long before we see tribals of Gadchiroli lodged in the prisons
of Mumbai.
:::

::: class-0
When re-admitted in prison I was assigned hauladi number 162. Due to the
increase in the number of undertrials arrested in Naxal offences, the
administration had begun classifying and numbering us separately. I was
the 162nd Naxal undertrial to be admitted in the Nagpur prison in 2011.
This number had grown from just thirteen in
2008. Throughout my years of incarceration, it was this community of
political prisoners that became my de facto family. A desire for social
change and a common approach for struggle kept us united in prison
despite being lodged in different barracks.
:::

::: class-0
In the rest of the country, too, we political prisoners now formed a
significant proportion of the non-criminals in jails. As people across
the country increasingly confronted the ruling classes and their state,
our numbers were rising. While all of us shared some conviction in a
cause dreaded by those in power, many of us had been implicated in acts
in which we had played no role, or acts that had been criminalized by
the provisions of special laws. Muslim students who protested communal
atrocities, tribals who fed a Naxalite squad, activists and Maoist
sympathisers could all be labelled terrorists and anti-nationals under a
variety of special laws.
:::

::: class-0
Such political prisoners entered the jail with a stamp imposed by the
police that the prison authorities immediately acted upon. Their first
step was a quarantine policy that was followed more stringently than any
Prison Manual provision for communicable diseases. Segregation was the
rule and the greater the estimated ideological infection the prisoner
could cause, the harsher the segregation. The anda barrack, gunahkhaana
cells and even phasi yard came in handy to cut us off from ordinary
prisoners. We Naxalite prisoners were listed separately in the daily
counting and forced to wear green sleeve bands to mark us out. In July
2007, the Inspector General of Prisons issued circulars on how to
contain Naxalites and restrict their influence not only on prisoners but
also on the prison staff and officers.
:::

::: class-0
In all this, he was only faithfully adhering to the 'septic tank
principle' proposed by Reginald Craddock,
Lt. Governor of Burma, in his correspondence with the Indian home
department in 1918. He prescribed separate barracks, separate yards and
even separate prisons for freedom fighters to 'keep the poisonous gas
within the tank and ensure the safe custody of those emitting it'.
Despite the Supreme Court ruling against the quarantining of such
political prisoners, prisons across the country routinely adhere to this
practice. The new 'Model Prison Manual' of the central government even
calls for the setting up of separate and isolated 'high-security'
prisons to lodge such inmates.
:::

::: class-0
But try as they may, no jail administration can hold back the fragrance
of the septic tank from reaching the barracks. As I've said earlier,
every day, much of our time went into teaching those interested in
learning English and Maths, drafting legal applications or translating
English case papers into Marathi or Hindi. This earned us credibility so
when we organized agitations, such as the one in October 2009 to protest
the death of Mukesh Chankapure, the bootlegger who was beaten to death
in prison, the prisoners immediately heeded our call to boycott the
day's meal. The authorities knew that political prisoners had the
potential to unite everyone in a just cause. A sizeable section of the
general barracks had also joined our campaign in February 2010 to
support statehood for Vidarbha.
:::

::: class-0
The Naxalite and Muslim political prisoners joined hands on 13 September
to commemorate the martyrdom of Jatin Das, who died on the 63rd day of a
hunger strike, along with Bhagat Singh in the Lahore prison, during the
freedom movement. In jails across India, this day is observed as an
occasion to demand recognition as political prisoners and call for their
unconditional release.
:::

::: class-0
But, as I have tried to show in the book, the life of a
political prisoner is a lonely one---the
loneliness accentuated by memories of a more productive existence
outside. Political prisoner yards are oases of silence, in contrast with
the otherwise crowded and noisy surroundings. The scrape of a chess
piece or click of a carom striker are often the only sounds. Many choose
to immerse themselves in day-long reading and desultory writing. But
these too are perhaps forms of escape from reality, quite comparable
with the delusions of the 65-year-old long-haired Kithulal.

In case you have not heard the good news, I have been ordered to be
released on bail in one of the two cases. After the formalities of
producing sureties are completed, I shall be released in that case.
However there is no immediate need to rush this procedure, since the
other case is still pending. It should end by this month or latest by
the next. Hence I am not trying for bail in it. The news of bail is
really refreshing. Suddenly life in prison merely seems to be a bad

Interesting to read how the British courts work and the conditions of

others' charge sheets, I am going through another novel by Henning

In November 2011, my dedicated team of lawyers in Mumbai,
Nagpur and Gadchiroli finally got me a bail
order. My lawyers were not only efficient and capable but were also
committed to getting me through the colossal tangle of cases, which at
times seemed impossible and hopeless. As civil rights advocates, they
viewed the incarceration of political prisoners as reflecting the
undemocratic state of affairs in the country. They were always ready to
defend our rights and would, whenever the need arose, rush to the High
Court or the Gondia, Chandrapur or Gadchiroli courts despite repeated
threats and annoying surveillance from the police. Shahid Azmi, one such
civil rights activist and lawyer, was shot dead in February 2010 at his
office in Mumbai at the young age of 32. The deeper links of his supari
killers were never investigated. Shahid had been a relentless defender
of political prisoners, especially of Muslims arrested in terrorist
crimes and was part of my legal defence team in Mumbai.
:::

::: class-0
During prison struggles or hunger strikes, these lawyers would
immediately respond to our call and provide all possible support. In
emergencies, they would also arrange to provide stationery, legal
literature, clothes or even just visit my family to console them.
Indeed, over time I began to regard my lawyers as family.

[The judge was on vacation and hence we have got another date after
almost a month. Therefore release plans may be further delayed. Hope
this delay gives the lawyers adequate time in preparing my petition to
be filed before the High Court regarding my abduction and subsequent
rearrest. It may be necessary for you to be in touch with the Mumbai and
Nagpur lawyers, as an affidavit may have to be prepared stating on oath
that you were present at the spot of my abduction. I heard that the
local government officials have been harassing you for a bribe for the
preparation of the solvency papers for my surety by stretching a process
which can be done in a few minutes to almost two weeks. Once they sense
there is urgency and anxiety they tend to be more greedy. Sarkari
vultures never miss out on such opportunities. Hence be patient, we have
time until the other case is completed.]

Beyond the Lal Gate
:::

::: noindent-0
On 3 January 2012, my advocates filed a petition on my behalf before the
Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court seeking remedies for the violation
of my fundamental right to life and personal liberty. It sought
compensation, action against the police officers responsible for this
outrage and an enquiry into the practice of abduction and rearrest of
undertrials like me by the Gadchiroli police. I had been acquitted in
ten of the eleven cases I had been arraigned in and was granted bail in
the last one of Gadchiroli. This last case related to an incident of
firing between Naxals and police personnel
in the forests of northern Gadchiroli.
:::

::: class-0
The next day, 4 January 2012, I was to be released. My parents had come
a day earlier to submit the bail papers in the Gadchiroli court and
would remain to receive me after the court ordered my release. But,
stepping out of the Lal Gate once again made me extremely nervous. From
the morning, I had been looking for signs of another possible rearrest.
This time, I packed my toothbrush, some toiletries, a set of extra
clothes and some stationery. I would need them if I was rearrested and
sent to another prison. Chandu, the danda kamaan of the anda whom I met
on my way to the judicial department, assured me that this wouldn't
happen. He received this information when he had gone to clean the
toilets in the staff quarters. Even friendly guards and employees
informed me that there was no police activity outside the gate.
Nevertheless, I doubted my release would be trouble-free. Fortunately,
the vociferous public outcry and the skills of my lawyers worked in my
favour. After 4 years and 8 months, I walked out of the Lal Gate, a free
man.
:::

::: class-0
As I stepped out, I was greeted by my mom, dad, advocates and
journalists.
:::

::: class-0
'It's over,' I said, hugging my parents. I had no comments for the eager
media, wary that anything I said would be used against me. That's what
happened in November 2010 when Tusharkanti Bhattacharya, a political
prisoner from Andhra Pradesh, was rearrested after a few months based on
an interview he had given to the media when he was released.
:::

::: class-0
We returned to Mumbai the same day. Throughout the journey, my mother
was extremely nervous every time we passed a cop. My sister too had
instructed her not to let go of me until I got back home safely. My
Nagpur advocate repeatedly rang me to check
whether all was well.
:::

::: class-0
The next day, at home, I began receiving calls from friends and
well-wishers. Mom became my temporary personal secretary. I had to write
a letter to Vernon and other friends at the Nagpur prison as I had
promised. Mistakenly, I wrote my own address as Nagpur. I mentioned
getting home safely and how I was enjoying a simple but divinely tasty
home-cooked meal. Later, I met my wife and Akshay, who was now turning
seven. He had just come home after giving his school tests.

For a moment, he failed to recognize me. 'That's Dada,' my wife helped
him.

'So how's my Ben-ten hero?' I said to break the ice. From prison, I
would occasionally draw him a cartoon and send it to him in my wife's
letters. He had pasted these on the door of his cupboard. The cartoons
did the trick. He was soon talking to me, sitting on my lap and telling
me about his favourite cartoon character.
:::

'How did your maths paper go?'

'Hmm, okay, but I got one sum wrong,' he answered, gradually getting

abruptly asked, 'When will you be going again?'

Over the next few days, my family told me about events in Mumbai related
to my arrest: the flood of allegations appearing in the media; the
unexpected police searches and visits; the hostility they experienced
from persons earlier considered well-wishers; and the new friendships
built on true sympathy. But rather than these events, what they were
more interested in talking about were the trials and tribulations they
had been put through, the emotional
distress they had to deal with. During these past years, my parents had
aged considerably. My incarceration had had a large role to play in
this. My brother and sister had selflessly put in their best efforts to
help me, sacrificing family commitments and putting their jobs at risk.
My wife too, had kept her life and career in a state of suspension,
juggling multiple responsibilities in my absence.

I was relatively fortunate. After his release, Naresh Bansod had to deal
with the collapse of his marriage. His boy stayed with him, while his
daughter lived with his former wife. Dhanendra Bhurule and his wife
somehow managed to get back their earlier jobs and repay pending loans.
To the best of my knowledge, Ashok Reddy is still incarcerated in a
prison in Andhra Pradesh.
:::

::: class-0
For the longest time, I found it difficult to deal with my life as a
free man. Persistent phone calls from the media left me in a daze. In
prison, the only person I would meet was my lawyer and we would always
jot down in advance what was to be discussed with him. Technology, too,
was a big challenge. In the world of apps, mobiles and other gizmos, I
felt challenged. All this made me realize how totally unsuccessful
prisons are in preparing a person for society. Being in jail for 4 years
and 8 months temporarily incapacitated me. I wonder how those who are
released after 18 to 20 years cope with life on the outside.
:::

::: class-0
Habits learnt in prison die hard. I often get that urge to preserve a
used pen refill so I could repair a pair of broken sandals or a plastic
container for our handi gaadi. Solitude, too, is something I miss from
time to time. The occasional hustle or noise at home or at get-togethers
soon makes me irritable. I also get nostalgic for some aspects of the
simple prison life, such as the camaraderie I shared with other
political prisoners and the depth of
friendship and solidarity we were able to develop. The abundance of time
we had at our disposal allowed us to understand each other almost in
totality.

Life after prison is weighed down by two emotions. One is fear---the
fear of further action by the State. The fear that the State will
somehow get me back in the prison, as has become prevalent with those
political and human rights activists who have chosen to dissent. The
fear that Big Brother is watching every step I take, watching who I meet
and watching which peoples' struggle I choose to support. My involvement
in any such movement will then become an excuse for branding it Maoist
and justify repression.
:::

::: class-0
The second is the emotion of confusion---of how to build life back
again, how to build those relations that were tested and strained during
the years of incarceration. Confusion of how to live life and yet follow
the ideals I believe in. To sacrifice the latter in the interest of the
former is much easier. However, I guess all these dilemmas are part of
the freedom every other citizen experiences in this so-called democracy.
This freedom is definitely better than a caged existence. This freedom
however needs to be worked on. Yes, it needs to be worked upon.
