# Early Years

Appropriately enough, tendulkar begins the first volume
with a twenty-five page account of our history --- from 'Plassey to
Amritsar'. He presents great events and personalities --- the
revolt of 1857 which 'brought forth among others the inspiring
figure of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi who died fighting on the
battlefield'; the famines which enveloped India under British
rule, beginning with the Bengal famine of 1770; the great Ram
Mohun Roy, who insisted on visiting a French ship as a mark
of homage from his motherland to France which had raised
aloft the banner of revolution for liberty, equality, fraternity;
scholar-politicians like Pherozshah Mehta, Dadabhai Naoroji,
Ranade, Tilak and a host of others; the inspiring scene at the
Amsterdam session of the _International Socialist Congress_ in
1904 at which the Grand Old Man of Indian nationalism, Dadabhai
Naoroji, represented the people of India and 'the delegates
leapt to their feet and stood uncovered before him in solemn
silence to mark their respect for India's representative'; the call
of _swaraj_ from the platform of the _Indian National Congress_;
the appearance of the new radical school of politics led by the
well-known trio : Lal, Bal, Pal (Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar
Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal); the historic trial and the barbaric
sentence on Tilak against which there was nationwide protest,
including a protest strike by the textile workers of Bombay, probably
the first political strike of workers in India, hailed immediately
by Lenin; the new upsurge of anti-imperialism which
emerged in the period of, and immediately after, the first world
war, etc.

It was in such an epoch, an epoch in which the Indian
people were slowly getting unified in and through the antiimperialist
struggle, that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was
born as the last son of Karamchand Gandhi. Uttamchand, the
grandfather, as well as Karamchand, the father of Mohandas,
had been prime ministers in several Kathiawad States.

> In this service, they had acquired a reputation for loyalty, ability
and character, rare qualities in State officials. ... The Gandhi clan
played an important part in the political life of Porbandar (I,
pp. 27--8).

The impact of the epoch seems to have been felt by young
Mohandas. We are told that the argument in favour of meat-eating
which most appealed to him was, 'Behold the mighty
Englishman! He rules the Indian small; because, being a meat-eater,
he is five cubits tall!' --- the popular doggerel among
schoolboys in those days. 'If the country took to meat-eating',
thought Mohandas, 'the English can be overcome'. This, of
course, was a brief interlude in the otherwise vegetarian life
which the Mahatma led for nearly 80 years.

We are also told that, from very early boyhood, Mohandas
used to argue with his mother that untouchability was not
sanctioned by religion. Mohandas had also to face ostracism
from his caste for going abroad for his studies. 'This boy', said
a general meeting of the caste, 'shall be treated as an outcaste
from today. Whoever helps him, or goes to see him off at the
dock, shall be punishable with a fine of one rupee and four
annas'.

One of the letters of introduction which young Mohandas
carried to England was addressed to Dadabhai Naoroji.

> Dadabhai was in London at the time. In 1890 he started _India_,
a journal for the discussion of Indian affairs, which influenced the
young Indian students in England. ... (He) used to address meetings
at the Indian Association. Gandhi once mustered courage at
one of these meetings to present to Dadabhai the note of introduction.
Dadabhai said, 'You can come and have my advice whenever
you like' (I, p. 37).

In London Mohandas Gandhi, the budding lawyer, tried
to interest himself in various progressive movements. Though
he was not an atheist, he got interested in atheism through
Charles Bradlaugh, then its chief British advocate. Along with
several British celebrities, Gandhiji attended the funeral of
Bradlaugh. '"For atheists like Bradlaugh, truth held the same
place as God for others," was the opinion of Gandhi'.

It is interesting to note that, during the London dockers'
strike in 1889, Gandhiji in the company of an Indian friend went
to Cardinal Manning to congratulate him for helping the strikers.

However, it is characteristic of the future Mahatma that
the movement which interested him most while in London was
--- _vegetarianism_!

>In one of his wanderings in the town in search of vegetarian
dishes, Gandhi came across a queer restaurant which not only served
vegetarian diet but propagated it through literature. He bought
here Salt's _Plea for Vegetarianism_ which created in him an interest
in dietetics. He came in contact with those who were regarded as
pillars of vegetarianism. ... He joined the _London Vegetarian
Society_ and soon found himself on its executive committee. He
helped to design its badge. Full of zeal, he started a vegetarian club
in his locality, Bayswater. He became its secretary. ... He contributed
nine articles on Hindu customs and diet to the magazine,
_Vegetarian_ (I, pp. 35--6).

All this in an epoch and in a country which the author of
_Mahatma_ describes as follows:

> New ideas were preached and practised as never before or after
in the history of England. The Independent Labour Party was
formed in 1887. The Fabian Society under the leadership of Sydney
Webb and Bernard Shaw was popularising socialism and scientific
thought. The first volume of _Das Kapital_ by Karl Marx had just
appeared in England in 1887 and was accepted as the Bible of the
working class. Marx's colleague, Friedrich Engels, who was living
in England, brought out the second volume in German in 1885 and
was now working on the third volume of _Das Kapital_. In 1889,
_Fabian Essays_ was published by Bernard Shaw. Darwin's epochmaking
_Descent of Man_ which had been published in 1871 was
being discussed. Kropotkin's _Mutual Aid_ was appearing in the
_Nineteenth Century_ and Kropotkin himself was propagating his ideas
in England. Ruskin and William Morris created new interest in the
art world (I, p. 38).

The man who preferred the movement for vegetarianism
to all these radical, intellectual and practical-political movements
would have appeared to many at the time as crankish. Future
developments, however, showed that there was nothing crankish
about it. His veneration for the Grand Old Man of India
(Dadabhai Naoroji); his sincere respect for, but differences with,
the British atheist and friend of India, Charles Bradlaugh; his
interest in the strike of London dockers; his identification with
the vegetarian movement --- all these were part of a philosophy
of action which was to be decisive in the history of India for
the next half century.

This was, as a matter of fact, revealed in the next few years,
years in which the young barrister, Mohandas Gandhi, practised
both his law and his philosophy of life in relation to the practical
living conditions of Indians in South Africa. Tendulkar takes
us, in more than 130 pages, through the years 1893 to 1914, in
the course of which Gandhiji perfected his technique of _satyagraha_,
to be tried subsequently on a nationwide scale in India
in 1921, 1930, 1932 and 1942. In the later movements, Gandhiji
did, of course, further develop and perfect the technique of
_satyagraha_. But, in this very first experiment are to be seen the
main outline of the philosophy and practice of what has now
come to be known as _Gandhism_. It will, therefore, be useful for
us here to note the distinguishing features of the movement in
South Africa as it developed in the course of two decades.

_Firstly_, the South African Indian movement was, as were
the movements of other sections abroad, _an all-class movement_,
--- the issue being one which affected Indians of all classes and
creeds --- the issue of equal rights for Indians with Europeans,
For instance, when Gandhiji drew up the petition requesting the
South African assembly to postpone further discussion of the
Bill disfranchising Indians,

> Young people who never before had done any public work were
drawn into the work. For the first time, a good number of Christian
youths were brought together. The volunteers with knowledge of
English and several others sat up the whole night to make copies of
the petition. Merchant volunteers went out in their own carriages
to obtain signatures (I, p. 49).

Not only was this the case in South Africa, it was so in India
as well. When Gandhiji came to India for a short while in 1896,
he popularised the cause of Indians in South Africa and received
good response from the newspapers and politicians in India.
Even Anglo-Indian papers like the _Pioneer_ and _The Times of
India_ commented favourably on the pamphlet which Gandhiji
wrote on the subject.

As the South African movement developed, Gandhiji began
to receive financial help from the richest sections of Indian
society. Among the donors for the _satyagraha_ fund in South
Africa were to be found such names as the founder of the House
of Tatas, Ratanji Jamshedji Tata, who gave Rs. 25,000; the Aga
Khan, who collected Rs. 3,000 at the 1909 session of the _All-India
Muslim League_; J. B. Petit, who remitted Â£ 400 and the Nizam
of Hyderabad who donated Rs. 2,500.

_Secondly_, though the movement was thus one which secured
the blessings of the richest sections of Indian society, it _drew
its real strength from the militancy and self-sacrificing spirit of
the poor toiling sections of Indians in South Africa_. This was
natural because, while disabilities like disfranchisement affected
all classes of Indians, it was the poor indentured labourers who
had to face the worst forms of oppression and exploitation. The
first experience which Gandhiji had of the life of indentured
labourers is described as follows by the author:

> A Tamil man in tattered clothes, head-gear in hand, with two
front teeth broken and his mouth bleeding stood before the young
barrister. Gandhi was shocked to see this spectacle and persuaded
him to put his turban on and behave like an equal. It was a new
experience to the poor slave. Balasundaram, as this poor visitor was
called, was serving his indenture under a well-known European
resident of Durban. His master beat the helpless worker till he bled.
Gandhi sent for a doctor to secure certificate and took the injured
man to a magistrate. It was not Gandhi's desire to get the eniployer
punished but he wanted Balasundaram to be released from him.
Like the slave, the indentured labourer was the property of his
master. Gandhi succeeded in transferring him to someone else.
Balasundaram's case reached the ears of every indentured labourer
as far as Madras, and Gandhi came to be regarded as their friend
(I. p. 52).

Once aroused and drawn into action, the poor indentured
labourers displayed such marvels of heroism which the working
class alone is capable of showing. In a chapter entitled 'The
Epic March', the author describes how six thousand coal-mine
workers of Newcastle (South Africa) went on a strike which
became an inseparable part of the struggle. In the course of
this struggle, they showed heroism and capacity for organisation.

> The strike was in full swing and the stream of labourers still
continued by rail and road. Two women with grim courage reached
Charlestown though their little ones died on the way. One of the
children died due to exposure on the march and the other fell down
from the arms of its mother while she was crossing the stream and
was drowned. But the brave mothers refused to be dejected and
one of them said: 'We must not pine for the dead who will not come
back to us for all our pining. It is the living for whom we must
work' (I, p. 170).

Gandhiji was greatly moved by this spirit of struggle and
self-sacrifice shown by the common people and it left an indelible
impression on his mind. We find, for example, the following
remarks in his reply to the address of welcome which he and his
wife received in Madras in 1915:

> If one-tenth of the language that has been used in this address
is deserved by us, what language do you propose to use for those
who lost their lives, and, therefore, finished their work, on behalf
of your suffering countrymen in South Africa? What language do
you propose to use for Nagappan Narayanaswamy, lads of seventeen
or eighteen years, who braved in simple faith all the trials, all the
sufferings, and all the indignities for the sake of the honour of the
motherland? What language do you propose to use with reference
to Valliamma, a sweet girl of sixteen years, who was discharged
from Martizburg prison, skin and bone, suffering from fever to which
she succumbed after about a month's time? You have said that I
inspired those great men and women, but I cannot accept that proposition.
It was they, the simple-minded folk, who worked away
in faith, never expecting the slightest reward, who inspired me to
the proper level, and who compelled me by their great sacrifice, by
their great faith, by their great trust in the great God to do the
work that I was able to do. It is my misfortune that I and my wife
have been obliged to work in the limelight and you have magnified
out of all proportions this little work we have been able to do. They
deserve the crown which you would seek to impose upon us. These
young men deserve all the adjectives that you have so affectionately,
but blindly, lavished upon us (I, pp. 200--1).

_Thirdly_, though the struggle was one in which _the working
people played the most heroic and, therefore, the most decisive
role, it was not they but Gandhiji who decided the course which
the movement should take_. From the beginning to the end of
the struggle in South Africa, as in the case of subsequent struggles
which the Mahatma led, we discover a familiar and common
characteristic: the great mass of the people show marvels of
heroism and sacrifice, but a few leaders at the top plan and
direct the movement along the path which they think best. As
a matter of fact, we can perceive, in general outline, all the
elements of the technique of organisation and struggle which
Gandhiji adopted in later years.

The starting and conducting of a paper, _The Indian Opinion_,
the forerunner of _Young India_ and _Harijan_; the organisation of
the Phoenix Settlement in 1904 and of the Tolstoy Farm in
1910, the forerunners of the Sabarmati and Wardha ashrams;
the minutely worked out rules of conduct for the inmates of the
settlements and of the observance of self-imposed 'discipline',
as the essential pre-condition for starting and conducting struggles;
the scrupulously worded correspondence with the authorities
before and during struggles; correspondence and negotiations
even from inside jail; the settlements arrived at with the
authorities without the knowledge or consent of the mass of the
people who participated in the struggle; the personal guidance
given by Gandhiji himself, even on the minutest details of the
struggle, followed by the appointment of his successor when he
is arrested --- all these features of the manner of preparing,
conducting and calling off struggles appeared for the first time
in South Africa.

One remarkable thing in this connection is the extremely
reactionary _social outlook_ which guided Gandhiji throughout
his activities. It is here that we find the real significance of his
membership of the Vegetarian Association while in England.
For, just as he integrated his vegetarianism, his sense of solidarity
with the striking dockers of London and total indifference,
if not contempt for, the radical thinking of those days; similarly,
in South Africa, he integrated the militant struggles of the common
people with an obscurantist ideology. What is worse, at
the very time when he was leading these militant struggles,
we find him taking these very obscurantist ideas to the common
people. Thus he stands in marked contrast to Marx, Engels
and Lenin --- the last, by the way, a contemporary of his.
While Gandhiji, the young barrister, was writing articles for the
_Vegetarian_, Lenin, also a young lawyer, was translating Marx,
Sydney Webb, etc., and himself writing _The Development of
Capitalism_ in Russia. Lenin combined the militant mass movement
of the working class with the most advanced ideology;
Gandhiji combined it with the most reactionary and obscurantist
of ideologies that was current in the contemporary world.

See, for example, how he formulates his outlook on the
modern world in his _Hind Swaraj_ or _Indian Home Rule_ in 1909.
As Tendulkar himself sums up, _Hind Swaraj_ is a severe condemnation
of 'modern civilization'. It is divided into twenty
chapters, dealing with _swaraj_, civilization, lawyers, doctors,
machinery, education, passive resistance and other matters. Gandhiji
himself summarised the contents of the book in a letter
to a friend which Tendulkar quotes in full. The following
extracts from it will show Gandhiji's world outlook:

>... It is not the British people who are ruling India but it is
modern civilization, through its railways, telegraph, telephone, and
almost every invention which has been claimed to be a triumph of
civilization. Bombay, Calcutta, and the other chief cities of India
are the real plague-spots. If British rule were replaced tomorrow
by Indian rule based on modern methods, India would be no better
off, except that she would be able to retain some of the money that
is drained away to England; but then India would only become a
second or fifth nation of Europe or America. ... Medical science
is the concentrated essence of black magic. Quackery is infinitely
preferable to what passes for high medical skill as such. Hospitals
are the instruments that the Devil has been using for his own purpose,
in order to keep his hold on his kingdom. They perpetuate
vice, misery and degradation and real slavery. ... If there were no
hospitals for venereal diseases, or even for consumptives; we should
have less consumption, and less sexual vice amongst us. India's
salvation consists in unlearning what she has learnt during the
past fifty years or so. The railways, telegraphs, hospitals, lawyers,
doctors and such like have all to go (I, p. 130).

Not only did Gandhiji preach these ideas, but he tried to
practise them in organising his followers in the Phoenix Settlement,
in the Tolstoy Farm and at all times of struggle. He tried
to bring up boys and girls, who were taken as inmates of the
Settlement and the Farm, on the lines of what was subsequently
perfected in the well-known Vows and Truth --- _ahimsa_, celibacy,
non-stealing, non-possession and control of the palate. Having
the utmost contempt for the ideological and intellectual moulding
of the young generation, he tried to substitute uncritical
faith for independent thinking.

In all this, however, there is something which appeals to
the idealism, selflessness and spirit of sacrifice of the boys and
girls who flocked to his banner. Concealing the obscurantist
content of his _social outlook_ was the idealist willingness to
undergo suffering in struggle against evil. All the contempt that
Gandhiji had for modern civilization, the contempt which he
tried to inculcate in his disciples, had taken the form of opposition
to imperialist exploitation of the Indian and other oppressed
peoples. The following description of _petty-bourgeois_
socialism given by the founders of historical materialism in their
well-known work, _Manifesto of the Communist Party_, may be
said to be true to a certain extent of Gandhiji's _Hind Swaraj_:

>This school of socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions
in the conditions of modern production. It laid bare the
hypocritical apologies of economists. It proved, incontrovertibly,
the disastrous effects of machinery and division of labour; the concentration
of capital and land in a few hands; over-production and
crises; it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the _petty bourgeois_ and
peasant, the misery of the proletariat, the anarchy in production,
the crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial
war of extermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral
bonds, of the old family relations, of the old nationalities (K. Marx
and F. Engels, _Selected Works_, Vol. I, p. 57).

_Gandhiji's critique of modern civilization, however, had
nothing to do with the anti-imperialism of the oppressed peoples_.
It is remarkable how, at the very time when he was thundering
against 'modern civilization', he was acting as a loyal subject of
the British Empire, which was at that time one of the biggest
centres of that civilization. As he himself subsequently put it
in his well-known letter 'To Every Englishman in India':

>I put my life in peril four times for the cause of the empire
--- at the time of the Boer War when I was in charge of the ambulance
corps, whose work was mentioned in General Buller's despatches,
at the time of the Zulu revolt in Natal when I was in charge of a
similar corps, at the time of the commencement of the late war
when I raised an ambulance corps and as a result of the strenuous
training had a severe attack of pleurisy, and, lastly in fulfilment of
my promise to Lord Chelmsford at the War Conference in Delhi, I
threw myself in such an active recruiting campaign in Kheda district,
involving long and trying marches, that I had an attack of
dysentery which proved almost fatal. I did all these in the belief
that acts such as mine must gain for my country an equal status in
the empire (II, pp. 30--1).

All this at a time when a new spirit was emerging in the
country --- the spirit of revolt against imperialism. Characteristic
of Gandhiji and his philosophy of _non-violence_ is that, while on
the one hand, he was serving the Empire by recruiting young
men as cannon-fodder for imperialism's wars, he was one of the
few, even in England, to denounce Madanlal Dhingra, who attempted
to assassinate Sir Curzon Wylie. At the police court,
Dhingra claimed that it was his right as a patriot to do this deed:

> I believe that a nation held down by foreign bayonets is n a
perpetual state of war, since often battle is rendered impossible to a
disarmed race. ... Poor in wealth and intellect, a son like myself
has nothing else to offer to the mother but his own blood, and so I
have sacrificed the same on her altar. The lesson required in India
at present is to learn how to die, and the only way to teach it is by
dying ourselves. Therefore, I die, and glory in my martyrdom
(I, p. 125).

This statement of Dhingra drew from the mouth of the arch-imperialist
Winston Churchill, then under-secretary for the colonies,
the remark, 'the finest ever made in the name of patriotism'.
But Gandhiji had something else to say on that. 'Those
who believe that India has gained by Dhingra's act and other
similar acts in India make a serious mistake. Dhingra was a
patriot, but his love was blind. He gave his body in a wrong
way, its result can only be mischievous'.

Here, therefore, we see a man who rouses large masses of
the common people in action against imperialist exploitation and
oppression; who stands at the head of those hundreds of men
and women who leave their impress on history by the heroism
and self-sacrificing spirit shown in the course of struggle; who,
therefore, secures the allegiance and confidence of thousands of
people throughout India; who, however, tries his best to convince
his followers that the way to end exploitation is not militant
struggle against it, but serving its war and oppression; who
denounces the patriotic acts of revolutionaries like Dhingra in
the name of _non-violence_ but has no qualms of conscience in
sending scores of people to their death as imperialism's cannonfodder;
who, above all, in the name of opposing imperialist exploitation,
denounces all that is modern, scientific and progressive
in human civilization.
