# Meaning Of _Gandhism_

The life what is the significance of and teaching of
Mahatma Gandhi? Is the story of his life 'the story of his experiments
with truth' as he himself put it in the 1920's when he
started writing his autobiography?

How are we to explain the evolution of Mohandas Gandhi
into the 'Father of the Nation'; the devoted sergeant during the
first world war into the leader of the 'Do or Die' movement of
1942, with its inspiring slogan of 'British Rulers, _Quit India_'; the
scion of a family of loyal servants of the feudal rulers of Porbunder
State into a fighter for democracy in the Indian States;
the religious-minded youth who was not attracted by any of the
radical movements, but landed himself in the Society of Vegetarians
in London, into the most outstanding leader of the anti-imperialist
and democratic movement in our country?

Such are the questions which naturally come to our minds
as we close the story of the eventful life briefly outlined in the
preceding pages. These are not abstract questions, but questions
which have their bearing on the practical tasks which every
democrat in our country has to fulfil today. For, though the
Mahatma is no more in our midst, his life-long teachings are
guiding the activities of several groups and individuals inside
the democratic movement.

The _Bhoodan movement_, for example, is undoubtedly based
on Gandhiji's teachings; it is a movement with whose theories
and practice one may disagree, but which one can never ignore.
The two aspects of the _Bhoodan movement_ --- its revolt against
the existing system of landed property, as well as its insistence
that the mal-distribution of landed property should be rectified
in a 'non-violent' way --- are both the application of Gandhiji's
teachings to the most important social problem of our country,
the problem of land distribution.

Let us not forget either that it is because of the inspiration
drawn from Gandhiji's teachings that several of the present-day
Gandhians (including Vinobaji himself) have, in some way or
other, associated themselves with the peace movement.

On the other hand, let us not forget that it is in the name
of Gandhiji's teachings against what is called 'mob violence'
that the present-day leaders of the government, both at the Centre
and in the States, attack the growing mass movement of the
working class and peasantry.

It is a measure of the enormous significance of the role
played by Gandhiji in the history of our national movement that
every trend and faction inside the _Congress_, and almost every
political party barring the _Communist Party_, uses the name of
Gandhiji and his teachings for justifying and defending its policies.
Serious attempts to assess the role and significance of Gandhiji
and his teachings should, therefore, be considered of enormous
practical importance for the further development of the
democratic movement.

This is not an easy task. Like several other historical personages,
Gandhiji had a highly complex personality; his teachings,
too, are incapable of over-simplified assessments on the
lines of his being 'the inspirer of the national movement who
roused the masses to anti-imperialist action', 'the counter-revolutionary
who did all he could to prevent the development of our
national movement on revolutionary lines', etc.

His life was so rich in events, his speeches and writings so
prolific and touched such varied fields of human activity, his
actions at various stages so dramatic, that it will be easy enough
for any student of his life and teachings to prove his or her own
pet theory about Gandhiji and _Gandhism_. What he or she has
to do is only to string together a series of selected incidents from
his life and selected pronouncements from his speeches and
writings. It is, however, far more difficult to select those that
are really significant from the point of view of history, see the
interconnection between the various aspects of his life and
teachings, and then to arrive at an integrated understanding of
the man and his mission.

Unfortunately for us, the efforts which have so far been
made belong to the two categories --- either over-simplified and
one-sided tributes, or equally over-simplified and one-sided
criticisms. Every effort should, therefore, be made to avoid both
these pitfalls. It is as a contribution to such efforts that the
conclusions which appear to the present writer to flow from his
life are given below.

The _first_ point to be noted is that Gandhiji was an idealist
--- idealist not only in the sense that the world-outlook which guided
him was opposed to philosophical materialism, but also in the
sense that he kept before him certain ideals to which he clung
till the end of his life. Moral values like truth, _non-violence_,
renunciation of the pleasures of life, etc.; political ideals such as
freedom, democracy, peace, etc.; social objectives such as abolition
of caste distinctions, emancipation of women, unity of all
religious groups and communities, etc. --- these were indivisible
parts of his life and teachings. It is this adherence to certain
ideals that made him plunge into the South African _satyagraha_
movement in the early part of his public life; it was this again
that enabled him to work out his _non-cooperation_ and other
campaigns for the freedom of the nation; it was this that made
him the champion of innumerable democratic causes and ultimately
made him a martyr in the noble cause of national unity.

_Secondly_, his idealism played a big role in rousing the
hitherto slumbering millions of the rural poor. The semi-religious
language which he used in speaking to them, the simple
un-ostentatious life which he led, and the passion with which he
fought for their demands --- all these drew the millions of the
rural poor towards him. They looked upon him as their saviour,
as a new incarnation of God, out to deliver them from the miserable
plight in which they are placed.

We may well consider his views on several social, economic
and cutlural questions as 'reactionary' (many of them undoubtedly
are reactionary). It would, however, be a profound mistake
to miss the fact that it was these freactionary' views of his
that enabled him to form a bridge between the mass of peasantry
and the sophisticated representatives and leaders of the
modern national-democratic movement. It may appear self-contradictory
if one were to say that Gandhiji with his 'reactionary'
_social outlook_ was instrumental in bringing about a profoundly
revolutionary phenomenon --- the drawing of the mass
of the rural poor into the arena of the modern national-democratic
movement. This self-contradiction, however, is a manifestation
of the contradiction in the real political life of our nation,
arising out of the fact that the national-democratic movement
was led by the _bourgeoisie_, linked with feudalism.

_Thirdly_, it should be pointed out that, though he played a
vital role in drawing the mass of the rural poor into the national
movement, it would be wrong to ascribe to him personally the
tremendous awakening which they showed in the years after the
first world war. For, this awakening was the result of historic
developments that were taking place in India as well as throughout
the world. The slow and steady deterioration in the economic
conditions of the Indian peasantry which reached alarming
proportions during and immediately after the first world war;
the growth of a radical wing inside the Indian national movement,
which in certain areas touched sections of the peasantry
as well; the impact of such international developments as the
Turkish, Chinese and, above all, Russian revolutions on the
minds of the Asian people as a whole --- these were some of the
basic causes which had started acting on the consciousness of
the Indian peasantry. They would have acted --- probably not
in the same way --- even if Gandhiji had not come on the scene.

Stating this is not to deny Gandhiji's role as an individual
in giving a specific character to the awakening of the Indian
peasantry, to the fact that the new upsurge came to be linked
with the political movement for freedom and democracy. To
deny Gandhiji's contribution to the drawing of the rural poor
and to the consequent strengthening of the national-democratic
movement would be as one-sided as to ascribe to him all the
credit for the people's awakening itself.

_Fourthly_, while Gandhiji thus deserves praise for his role in
overcoming the major weaknesses of the national-democratic
movement --- making the movement really national and all-class
by bringing in the large masses of the hitherto unorganised rural
poor --- it should not be forgotten that he had always been and
continued till his death to be afraid of the rural poor acting as
an independent force. While he was all for mobilising them in
the struggle for freedom and democracy, he was keen that they
should act under the leadership of his own class, the _bourgeoisie_.

Ever since the days of _Chauri-Chaura_, he had taken special
care to devise all manner of measures to see that at every stage in
the struggle for freedom and democracy, the rural poor kept
themselves within the limits which were considered safe for the
_bourgeoisie_. Anybody who fails to recognise this reality will be
unable to explain why he was so insistent on _non-violence_ being
observed by the people in their struggle against imperialism and
their agents, while he had no qualms of conscience in acting as
the recruiting sergeant for imperialism during the first world war.

_Fifthly_, not only in relation to the rural poor, but also in
relation to the working class and other sections of the working
people, his was an approach which, in actual practice, helped the
_bourgeoisie_. His theory of _trusteeship_, his insistence on certain
moral values as the guiding lines for any political activity, the
skilful way in which he combined his own extra-parliamentary
activities (_constructive programme_ and _satyagraha_) with the
parliamentary activities of his lieutenants, the characteristically
Gandhian way of combining negotiations with the enemy even
while carrying on mass _direct action_ against himn --- all these
proved in actual practice to be of enormous help to the _bourgeoisie_
in (a) rousing the masses in action against imperialism
and in (b) preventing them from resorting to revolutionary mass
action. This ability of his to rouse the masses and yet to check
them, to launch anti-imperialist _direct action_ and yet to go on
negotiating with the imperialist rulers made him the undisputed
leader of the _bourgeoisie_. He was a leader in whom all factions
and groups inside the class had confidence and who, therefore,
could unify and activise it.

_Finally_, Gandhiji's role in history as the foremost leader of
the _bourgeoisie_ should not be taken to mean that he was always,
and on every issue, at one with the _bourgeoisie_. On the other
hand, it is characteristic of him, and the class of which he was
the friend, philosopher and guide, that, on several occasions and
on several issues, his was a minority voice, if not a lone voice:
On all such occasions, he and they agreed among themselves that
they would temporarily go along different paths. This is a phenomenon
which manifested itself again and again --- first in the
post-_non-cooperation_ years (division of labour between _Swarajists_
and _no-changers_ ); then in the years after the 1932--33 _civil
disobedience_ movement; several times during the second world
war and, finally, in the months preceding and following the
attainment of independence.

Particularly was this true of the last days of his life when
his idealism came into conflict with the 'iron practicalism' of the
'steel-minded' Sardar Patel, with the modernism of the radical
intellectual Pandit Nehru, and several others who had been his
colleagues and lieutenants for several years. It was this growing
gulf between him and his colleagues that made his life tragic
in the post-independence months, even before that life came to
a tragic end.

It is when we examine this growing gulf between him and
his colleagues in the last days of his life that we come to a really
objective all-sided assessment of Gandhiji, the man and his mission.
For, this growing gulf was the manifestation of the reality
that Gandhiji's insistence on certain moral values had once been
helpful to the _bourgeoisie_, but became, in the last days of his
life, a hindrance.

In the days in which it had to fight on two fronts --- fight imperialism
and, to this end, bring the mass of our urban and rural
poor into action; at the same time, fight the trend towards revolutionary
action which was growing among the masses --- the
_bourgeoisie_ found it quite useful to resort to the technique of
_non-violent resistance_ evolved by Gandhiji. However, once the
struggle against imperialism was crowned with success, in the
sense that the _bourgeoisie_ and its class allies got state power, it
was no more necessary to fight a two-front battle. Whatever
further struggles have to be waged against imperialism can be
waged at the state level, for which it was not necessary to draw
the masses of our people into action.

Furthermore, the very fact that the _bourgeoisie_ got state
power in its hands and had to use it in its own class interests,
brought it and its state machinery into ever more conflicts with
the mass of our people. Another result of their coming to power
was that the individual representatives of the _bourgeoisie_ who
came to power (ministers, MPs, and MLAs, etc.) began to enrich
themselves and their friends, relatives, hangers-on, etc., at
the cost of the state as well as of the people; to this end, they
resorted to any and every corrupt methods provided they yielded
results.

It was this change in the position of the _bourgeoisie_ as a
class and its individual representatives that brought it into conflict
with Gandhiji, the man who still clung to the ideals which
he had been preaching in the days of anti-imperialist struggle.
The moral values which he had preached in the days of antiimperialist
struggle now became a hindrance to the politicians
who came to power. Gandhiji, on the other hand, remained true
to them and could not reconcile himself to the sudden change
which occurred in his former colleagues and lieutenants. Particularly
was this so on the question of Hindu-Muslim unity and
on the corruption in the ranks of the _Congress_ (both of which
have already been described in the preceding chapter).

We may conclude by saying that Gandhiji became the
Father of the Nation, precisely because the idealism to
which he adhered in the years of anti-imperialist struggle became
a practically useful political weapon in the hands of the
_bourgeoisie_; furthermore, that he became more or less isolated
from the _bourgeoisie_ in the latter days of his life, because his
idealism did in the post-independence years become a hindrance
to the self-interest of the _bourgeoisie_.
