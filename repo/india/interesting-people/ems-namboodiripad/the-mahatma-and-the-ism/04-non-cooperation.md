# _Non-Cooperation_

It was such a man who entered the scene of India's national
politics towards the end of the first world war --- a man who was
undoubtedly respected by such venerable national leaders as
Gokhale, but considered rather 'crankish' in various ways.
Tendulkar tells us, for example, that Gokhale and his colleagues
in the _Servants of India Society_ had great respect and love for
him, yet he was not accepted as a member of the Society because,
in Gokhale's own words, 'they are hesitating to take any
risk, lest their high regard for you should be jeopardised'. He
also narrates how Gokhale was amused, if not shocked, when
Gandhiji told him about his decision of making a tour of India,
travelling third class, in order that he may acquaint himself with
the wretched condition of the lower class passengers.

Yet, a few years after he came to India and settled down,
he became the undisputed leader of the biggest national-political
movement which our country had witnessed. There were probably
very few who were at one with him in his social and philosophical
outlook; most of his elders and equals in the political
movement had ideas very different from his on everything in
relation to personal life as well as politics. Yet, hardly had he
entered the scene of national politics than they became spellbound
by his personality and came under his political and even
personal influence and submitted themselves to his advice and
guidance. Men and women, towering far above him in intellectual
capacity, virtually pledged themselves to service under his
guidance, and even subordinated their judgments to his.

This is, on the face of it, an amazing phenomenon. But
perhaps, it is not so amazing after all. For, all that was out
of the ordinary, religious and spiritualistic in Gandhiji's _social
outlook_, all that was unique in the tactics which he pursued in
order to realise his political aims and objectives, had one peculiar
quality --- they were all perfectly suited to the requirements
of a class that was daily growing in Indian society and was increasingly
asserting itself in the country's national-political life.

It will be useful, in this connection, to remind ourselves
that, as early as in the first half of the 19th century, symptoms
of the rise of a new class had appeared in Indian society. The
growth of a movement for progressive social reforms --- reforms
in the field of marriage, women's rights, inheritance, etc. --- as
well as a movement for the development of a new culture --- represented
by Raja Ram Mohun Roy and his prototypes in the
various provinces of India --- showed that the middle class of
the pre-British days was slowly acquiring the characteristic
features of a modern _bourgeoisie_. Fostered as it was by the new
rulers --- the British --- this class was so loyal to the British regime
that it wanted a replica of English civilization to be built in
India and, to that extent, came into conflict with the British,
who looked upon _bourgeois_ political democracy as an article
strictly for internal consumption and not for export. It was this
dual character of the rising _bourgeoisie_ that was reflected in the
'moderate politics' of the pioneers of the _Indian National
Congress_.

Gradually, however, the class represented by them outgrew
the limits set by their 'moderate politics'. The steady growth of
the _bourgeois_ _intelligentsia_, the slow but sure growth in the
economic power of the commercial and industrial _bourgeoisie_,
the experience which both of them gathered during the several
decades of their attempt to modernise India, and above all, the
new stirrings of the democratic movement in such oriental countries
as Japan and China as well as the Russian revolution of
1905, led to the emergence of what was then known as 'extremist
politics'. As opposed to the old school of leaders like Gokhale,
Naoroji and others, emerged a new school represented by Tilak
and others. As opposed to the time-honoured practice of passing
resolutions, leading deputations and such other methods of
'loyalist' agitation, a new form of popular agitation began to
emerge. This new form became so powerful in rallying the
people against the British regime as to throw the rulers into
utter panic.

It was this new form of popular agitation that endeared the
new generation of leaders like the well-known trio of Lala Lajpat
Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal among the people
and made Tilak the first hero of the modern 'national movement
when he was convicted to six years of imprisonment. It was
this that roused the entire country on the issue of the partition of
Bengal and gave rise to the movement of swadeshi --- the first
nationwide movement for the economic emancipation of the
country. It was, again, under the impact of these new stirrings
that what has incorrectly been called the 'terrorist' movement
of Bengal, Punjab, UP, etc., came into existence, led by such
revolutionary groups as the Anusilan and Yugantar in Bengal,
and the Gaddar in the Punjab.

The conflict between the old school and the new came to a
head at the _Surat congress_ of 1906. It resulted in an open split
between the two groups, one of which (the 'extremists') was
virtually thrown out of the _Congress_.

The main cause that gave rise to this split, however, did not
remain for long. For, the first world war which shook the entire
colonial world and gave rise to the development of national
liberation struggles in several countries of Asia could not long
keep even the 'moderates' where they were at the time of the
_Surat congress_. The slogan of self-determination of all peoples
which was raised by the statesmen of the _Allied Powers_, as well
as the anti-imperialist sentiments that swept the colonial and
dependent peoples throughout the world during the world war,
gave even to the most 'loyal', most 'moderate' politicians of our
_bourgeoisie_, the confidence that they could strengthen themselves
politically if only they adopted the technique which the
'extremists' had adopted a decade ago.

This change in the situation paved the way for a rapprochement
between the two schools which was solemnised at the
famous _Lucknow congress_ (1916), held within a decade of the
Surat split. This rapprochement between the 'moderates' and
'extremists', together with a simultaneous agreement between
the _Indian National Congress_ and the _Muslim League_ (the well-known
Lucknow pact providing certain guarantees for the Muslims
in the new political set-up, envisaged by the _Congress_)
gave a powerful fillip to the countrywide movement that was
slowly developing for '_Home Rule_'. The formation of two _Home
Rule_ Leagues, one under the leadership of Mrs Beasant and the
other led by Tilak, transformed the two agreements of Lucknow
into a powerful nationwide mass movement for radical changes
in the administrative system of the country.

It was when the entire _bourgeoisie_ was thus entering the
arena of national political struggle, when the united _bourgeoisie_
was trying to rally the entire nation around the simple slogan
of _Home Rule_, that Gandhiji returned to India with the experience
of the unique movement which he had organised and led
in South Africa. That was a movement which, like everything
else associated with Gandhiji, had evoked both admiration as
well as ridicule.

Whether belonging to the 'moderate' or 'extremist' school,
whether owing loyalty to the _Congress_ or to the League, whether
organised under this or that _Home Rule_ League, all politicians
of the _bourgeoisie_ admired the manner in which Gandhiji had
rallied the indentured Indian labour of South Africa and forced
its rulers make partial concessions of their demands. They,
however, did not take kindly, either to the philosophical outlook
which guided him in his activities, or to the various forms of
action and struggle which he resorted to.

All schools of the _bourgeois_-democratic political movement
in the country based themselves on the political movement of
the modern _bourgeoisie_, whose philosophical outlook guided
them in their activities. For them, politics of either the 'moderate'
or the 'extremist' variety were the application of similar
politics (Tory or Liberal) of modern capitalist countries, particularly
of Britain. Here, however, was a man who based himself
not on the philosophy, economics, sociology and political
science of the modern _bourgeoisie_, but on Hinduism with a
perceptible influence of Christianity. He appeared to them as
the very negation of the basic principle of secular politics.

Yet, in the matter of two or three years, they came to
accept him as the leader of the most powerful mass movement
for the attainment of that very objective for which they had
brought about a rapprochement between the 'moderates' and
the 'extremists', and between the _Congress_ and the _Muslim
League_. This will appear to be surprising if we fail to properly
appraise the main ingredients of what has come to be known
as the 'Gandhian technique', how this technique was applied to
the national-political situation of the post-first world war period,
and how it served the cause around which the entire _bourgeoisie_
came to be united at Lucknow in 1916.

The one point of departure between Gandhiji on the one
hand, and all other politicians of those days on the other, was
that, unlike the latter, _Gandhiji associated himself with the
masses of the people, their lives, problems, sentiments and aspirations_.
Politics for him was not a matter of high level debate
among erudite politicians; it was a matter of selfless service in
defence of people's interests and identifying oneself with
everything that is of the people. This characteristic feature of
_Gandhism_ in action was already visible in the South African
struggle in which, as we have noticed, Gandhiji drew inspiration
and sustenance from the simple and devoted action of the
common people.

It was this passion for close association with the common
people, this desire to familiarise himself with the living conditions
and problems of the people, that enabled Gandhiji slowly
to evolve a technique of political work which was as different
from the technique of the 'extremist' school as that of the
'moderate'. The manner in which this technique was used for
the first time in India is stated by Tendulkar:

>In the middle of January, Gandhi went to Rajkot and Porbundar
>to meet his relatives. He always travelled third, dressed like a poor
>passenger. He discarded his cumbrous cloak and white scarf and
>wore a shirt, a dhoti, and put on a cheap Kashmiri cap.
>
>At Wadhwan, an intermediate station, Motilal, a noted public
>worker and a tailor by profession, met Gandhi, and acquainted him
>with the hardships the railway passengers had to undergo, as a result
>of the notorious Viramgam customs.
>
>'Are you prepared to go to jail?' Gandhi asked abruptly. 'We
>will certainly go to jail, provided you lead us', replied Motilal
>(I, p. 196).

Gandhiji immediately took up the question of the Viramgam
customs and began correspondence with the Bombay Government.
Though this correspondence yielded no result, the question
was settled some time later, when he had occasion to meet the
Viceroy: the Viramgam customs cordon was ultimately removed.

This was soon followed up by another case in which, too,
the same technique was used --- the case of the indigo planters
of Champaran in Bihar. Champaran was a mass movement of
a far higher order than Viramgam. For, the Champaran issue
was not settled without a struggle. It was, in fact, the first mass
struggle which Gandhiji led in India.

The Champaran struggle is of great importance, firstly,
because it was directed against the European planters; secondly,
because, it rallied, under the banner of struggle for people's
demands, some of the finest young intellectuals of the time
--- those who subsequently became close associates and loyal disciples
of Gandhiji, such as Rajendra Prasad, Mazrul Haq, J. B.
Kripalani, etc.; thirdly, because, despite stiff opposition by the
European planters and their protectors in the bureaucracy,
Gandhiji and his comrades were able to bring the struggle to a
successful conclusion. This, therefore, may be said to be the
first dress-rehearsal of a type of national struggle which Gandhiji
was subsequently to lead on more than one occasion. _Here
was a movement in which a band of selfless individuals from the
middle and upper classes identified themselves with and roused
the common people against the powers-that-be in order to secure
some well-defined demands_.

Equally important, though in an altogether different respect,
was the manner in which Gandhiji intervened in the Ahmedabad
textile workers' strike of February-March, 1918. This was
the first occasion on which Gandhiji used his technique in the
conflict between workers and capitalists. The way in which he
led this struggle and gradually evolved what is commonly known
as 'Gandhian trade unionism' is of great importance in the evolution
of our national movement, in the evolution of _bourgeois_
leadership over the working-class movement.

> To lead the strike successfully, _Gandhi evolved a new method
>and laid down these conditions: never to resort to violence; never
>to molest blacklegs; never to depend on alms_; and to remain firm,
>no matter how long the strike continued, and to earn bread, during
>the strike by any other honest labour ... they (the strikers) attended
>the meetings in their thousands, and _he reminded them of
>their pledge and of the duty to maintain peace and self-respect. The
>workers daily paraded the streets of Ahmedabad in peaceful processions,
carrying their banner bearing the inscription 'Ek Tek', 'keep
>the pledge._
>
>The situation began to grow critical. _Gandhi would not allow
>the weavers to degrade themselves by seeking maintenance out of
>charity_. But to provide work for thousands of people was not easy.
>For the first two weeks the workers showed courage and self-restraint
>and daily held big meetings. _But at last they began to show
>signs of flagging. Gandhi was afraid of an outbreak of rowdyisin on
>their part, thus losing their cause_. The attendance at the daily
>meetings also began to dwindle, and despondency and despair were
>writ large on the faces of those who did attend.
>
>During the strike Gandhi consulted the mill-owners from time
>to time and entreated them to do justice by the labourers. 'We have
>our pledge too', they said. 'Our relations with the labourers are
>those of parents and children. How can we brook the interference
>of a third party? Where is the room for arbitration?'
>
>'Twenty days', in Gandhi's words, 'passed by; _hunger and the
>millowners' emissaries were producing their effect and Satan was
>whispering to the men that there was no such thing as God on earth
>who would help them and that vows were dodges resorted to by
>weaklings_'. The burden of the weavers' grumble was: '_It is all right
>for Gandhi Saheb to tell us to fight unto death. But we have to
>starve._'
>
>_On the morning of March 12, it was at a workers' meeting, while
>Gandhi was still groping, an idea occurred to him. 'Let us both
>starve', he said, 'in trying to keep your vows'. Spontaneously these
>words came to his lips: 'Unless the strikers rally and continue the
>strike till a settlement is reached or till they leave the mills altogether,
I will not touch any food'._
>
>The strikers were not prepared for these words. They said:
>'Not you, but we shall fast. It would be monstrous if you were to
>fast. Please forgive us for our lapse, we will now remain faithful
>to our pledge to the end' (I, p. 269--70. Emphasis added).

This was, of course, not the first time that Gandhiji resorted
to a fast. This, however, was the first time that he resorted to
it in order to check the militancy of the fighting people. It has
added significance in that he was using it, not in relation to a
movement in which all classes were participants, but in a
working-class struggle. His success in this experiment was an
invaluable lesson for the class of which he was the representative,
the _bourgeoisie_. It showed them that here was a technique
of struggle which could at once rally the masses and keep them
away from militant actions.

Viramgam, Champaran and Ahmedabad, however, were
but dress-rehearsals for something still bigger. For, everyone
of them was concerned with one or more partial demands of
particular sections of the people. There was, on the other hand,
the basic demand of the entire people, around which 'moderates'
as well as 'extremists', the _Congress_ as well as the _Muslim
League_, had united at Lucknow --- the demand for _Home Rule_.
It was necessary for Gandhiji to use his technique to secure this
national demand as well.

He did this by developing a movement among the people
of the Kheda district of Gujarat around the slogan of '20 recruits
from every village'. Those were days, it should be recalled,
when the British were in dire need of thousands of Indian
recruits for the successful execution of the war. The Viceroy
had convened a war conference in Delhi to which Gandhiji,
among others, had been invited. Gandhiji spoke in support of
the resolution on recruiting, the only condition being that he
should be permitted to speak in Hindusthani, a condition to
which the Viceroy readily agreed.

The manner in which Gandhiji conducted himself on this
question of recruitment was typical of the clever politician of
the _bourgeoisie_ that he was, a politician who, though speaking in
terms of such moral values as '_non-violence_', had no qualms of
conscience in recruiting young Indians as cannon-fodder for imperialism's
war in return for _Home Rule_. See, for example, how
he defended the recruitment campaign as part of the campaign
for _swaraj_:

> The easiest and straightest way to win _swaraj_ is to participate
in the defence of the Empire. If the Empire perishes, with it will
perish our cherished aspirations. Some say that, if we do not win
our rights just now, we would be cheated afterwards. The power
acquired in defending the Empire will be the power that can secure
those rights (I, p. 280).

The hopes entertained by Gandhiji and other politicians,
however, were not fulfilled. Far from granting the demand for
_Home Rule_, the British launched new attacks on the national
movement. The _Montagu-Chelmsford_ proposals for constitutional
reform negated all that the national movement had stood
for and demanded. Even the most 'moderate' of politicians
were dissatisfied with them. Added to them were the _Rowlatt
Bills_ arming the government with power to crush all resistance
to foreign rule. Public opinion, therefore, was gathering force
against the _Montagu-Chelmsford_ proposals and against the
_Rowlatt Bills_.

It was to meet this situation that Gandhiji had to use his
technique of mass political action within the framework of _non-violence_.
He knew that, though his ideas were being increasingly
accepted by broader sections of the people, he would have
to meet serious opposition from several respected leaders of the
_Congress_. He, therefore, organised his forces apart from, and
independently of, the _Congress_.

As soon as the notorious _Rowlatt Bills_ were published in
the Gazette, Gandhiji organised a conference at his _Satyagraha_
Ashram at which a _satyagraha_ pledge was drafted and signed
by Vallabhbhai Patel, Sarojini Naidu, B. G. Horniman, Umar
Sobani, Shankerlal Banker and Anasuya Behn. The signatories
'solemnly affirmed' that '... in the event of these Bills becoming
law and until they are withdrawn we shall refuse civilly to
obey these laws and such other laws as a committee to be hereafter
appointed, may think fit. ..'. They further affirmed that
'in this struggle we will faithfully follow truth and refrain from
violence to life, person or property'.

Gandhiji also started a _Satyagraha_ Sabha in Bombay which
began collecting signatures to the _satyagraha_ pledge; as many
as 1,200 persons enlisted in the Sabha within a fortnight. A
statement issued by the Sabha on March 1919, said: 'The committee
contemplated by the _satyagraha_ pledge has advised that
for the time being laws regarding prohibitory literature and
registration of newspapers may be civilly disobeyed'. The committee
selected a list of prohibited literature for dissemination
which included _Hind Swaraj_, _Sarvodaya_ and _Story of a
Satyagrahi_.

In pursuance of the programme of resistance to the _Rowlatt
Bills_, Gandhiji proposed a general _hartal_.

> _Satyagraha_ is a process of _self-purification_, and ours is a sacred
fight and it seems to me to be in the fitness of things that it should
be commenced with an act of _self-purification_. Let all the people
of India, therefore, suspend their business on that day and observe
the day as one for fasting and prayer. The Mussalmans may not fast
for more than one day; so the duration of the fast should be twentyfour
hours. It is very difficult to say whether all the provinces
would respond to this appeal of ours or not, but I feel fairly sure of
Bombay, Madras, Bihar and Sind. I think we should have every
reason to feel satisfied even if all these places observe _hartal_ fittingly
(I, p. 297).

The _hartal_ was fixed for 6 April 1919. It became the beginning
of a nationwide movement against the _Rowlatt Bills_, a
movement which spread from one end of the country to the
other. It was at Amritsar that it reached the greatest heights
of popular enthusiasm and bureaucratic brutality. It was there
that, under the brutal regime of the notorious Sir Michael
O'Dwyer, assisted by General Dyer, the 6th April demonstration
was followed by a series of incidents which culminated in the
notorious massacre of Jallianwala Bagh.

The development of the _Khilafat_ agitation[^4/1] brought new
strength to Gandhiji and his programme of _non-cooperation_.
For, this added to the ranks of the champions of _non-cooperation_
almost the entire world of Muslim divines who looked upon the
_Khilafat_ question as a question of religion and politics combined.
Gandhiji at once shrewdly added this to his list of grievances
against the British.

In his statement dated 10 March 1920, he said:

> The _Khilafat_ has now become a question of questions. ... Now
a word as to what may be done if the demands are not granted. The
barbarous method is warfare --- open or secret. This must be ruled
out, if only because it is impracticable. If I could but persuade
everyone that it is always bad, we should gain all lawful ends much
quicker. The power that an individual or a nation forswearing
violence can generate is a power that is irresistible (I, p. 345).

Gandhiji, however, knew that it was not so much a faith in
_non-violence_ but an anxiety to develop a mighty mass revolt
that motivated the Muslim divines. He, therefore, did not insist
on their adopting his principle of _non-violence_.

> But Muslims have special Koranic obligations in which Hindus
may or may not join. They, therefore, reserve to themselves the
right, in the event of the failure of _non-cooperation_ cum nonviolence,
in order to enforce justice, to resort to all such methods as
may be enjoined by the Islamic scriptures (I, p. 346).

It was a combination of all these circumstances --- his own
independent organisation of a band of _satyagrahis_ around himself;
his successful agitation on the living political issues which
were uppermost in the minds of the people, such as the _Rowlatt
Bills_ and the Punjab wrongs; his alliance with the Muslim
divines on the issue of _Khilafat_ --- that enabled Gandhiji to give,
on his own on 1 August 1920, the signal for the _non-cooperation_
campaign. To the objection raised by leaders like Pandit Malaviya
that Gandhiji should have awaited the _Congress_ decision,
his reply was as follows:

>My loyalty to the _Congress_ requires me to carry out its policy
>when it is not contrary to my conscience. If I am in a minority, I
>may not pursue my policy in the name of the _Congress_. The decision
of the _Congress_ on any given question, therefore, does not mean
>that it prevents a Congressman from any action to the contrary, but
>if he acts he does so at his own risk and with the knowledge that the
>_Congress_ is not with him.
>
>Every Congressman, every public body, has the right, it is sometimes
>their duty to express their own opinion, act upon it even and
>thus anticipate the verdict of the _Congress_. Indeed it is the best
>way of serving the nation (II, p. 3).

Gandhiji, together with Maulana Shaukat Ali and others,
toured extensively and roused the people on the issues of the
_Rowlatt Bills_, the Punjab tragedy and _Khilafat_. This had its
effect on the special session of the _Congress_ held in Calcutta
from 4--9 September 1920. The _Congress_, on Gandhiji's initiative,
adopted its resolution on progressive non-violent _non-cooperation_.
Its operative part states:

>This _Congress_ is further of opinion that there is no course left
>open for the people of India but to approve of and adopt the policy
>of progressive non-violent _non-cooperation_, until the said wrongs are
>righted and _swaraj_ is established.
>
>And inasmuch as a beginning should be made by the classes
>who have hitherto moulded and represented public opinion; and
>inasmuch as government consolidates its powers through titles and
>honours bestowed on the people, through schools controlled by it,
>through its law courts and its legislative councils, and inasmuch as
>it is desirable, in the present state of the movement, to take the
>minimum risk and to call for the least sacrifice compatible with
>the attainment of the desired object, this _Congress_ earnestly advises:
>
>(a) Surrender of titles and honorary offices and resignation of
>nominated posts in local bodies;
>(b) Refusal to attend government levees, durbars and other
>official and semi-official functions held by government officials, or
>in their honour;
>(c) Gradual withdrawal of children from schools and colleges
>in the various provinces;
>(d) Gradual boycott of British courts by lawyers and litigants
>and establishments of private arbitration courts by them for the
>settlement of private disputes;
>(e) Refusal on the part of the military, clerical and labouring
>classes to offer themselves as recruits for service in Mesapotamia;
>(f) Withdrawal by the candidates from election to the reformed
>councils and refusal on the part of the voters to vote for any candidate
>who may, despite the _Congress_ advice, offer himself for election;
>(g) Boycott of foreign goods (II, p. 12--3).

A study of the resolution will show the essential class political
character of the programme which Gandhiji was initiating.
It was candidly stated that _non-cooperation_ was a campaign, in
which a beginning should be made by 'the classes who have
hitherto moulded and represented public opinion', i.e., the
_bourgeoisie_ and the _petty bourgeoisie_. Furthermore, the items
included in the programme are such that, while they may well
irritate and harass the bureaucracy, while they may even create
a lot embarrassment and inconvenience to them, do not, even to
the slightest extent, shake the essential basis of imperialist rule.
It will be noticed that the resolution does not suggest such forms
of militant mass action as the industrial workers' general strike
or peasants' struggles like non-payment of rent and seizure of
land --- forms of struggle which touch upon the profits of Indian
capitalists and landlords as much as the economic and political
basis of the foreign rulers. Even the 'refusal on the part of the
military, clerical and labouring classes to offer themselves as
recruits' is confined to "service in Mesopotamia." It is thus clear
that non-violent _non-cooperation_ was conceived not as a form
of action which would strike at the roots of the imperialist state
structure, but as one which would only put so much pressure
on the rulers as would force them to come to terms with the
_Congress_'.

It would be useful, in this connection, to recall what Gandhiji
said on 18 April 1919, on the question of industrial workers'
united strike as a form of political action.

>In the course of the _satyagraha_ struggle in South Africa, several
thousands of indentured Indians had struck work. _This was a
_satyagraha_ strike_, and, therefore, entirely peaceful and voluntary.
Whilst the strike was going on, the strike of European miners, railway
employees, etc., was declared. _Overtures were made to me to
make common cause with the European strikers. As a satyagrahi,
I did not require a moment's consideration to decline to do so. I went
further, and for fear of our strike being classed with the strike of
Europeans in which methods of violence and use of arms found a
prominent place, ours was suspended, and _satyagraha_ from that
moment came to be recognised by the Europeans of South Africa
as an honourable and honest movement_, in the words of General
Smuts, 'a constitutional movement'. _I can do no less at the present
critical moment_. I would be untrue to _satyagraha_ if I allowed it
by any action of mine to be used as an occasion for feeding violence. ... (I, p. 317. Emphasis added).

This much-talked-of abhorrence of violence, however, is
nothing but the _bourgeoisie_'s natural fear that, once the working
class enters the field of political action with its own weapon
of struggle --- the weapon of political general strike --- the movement
will go beyond the limits set by it. That is why Gandhiji,
who had no hesitation to call for 'twenty recruits from every
village' to be offered as cannon-fodder in imperialism's bloody
wars, shuddered at the few incidents of violence which broke
out when the common people, the workers and peasants, entered
the field of action as an organised political force.

That again is why he consistently refused to include in his
programme, such demands of the middle peasants, poor peasants
and the landless poor, as cancellation of usurious debts,
drastic reduction of rent, and distribution of landlords' lands
among the peasants, etc. The furthest he was prepared to go,
and did go, was what was incorporated in the resolution of the
Nagpur session of the _Congress_ in December 1921:

> ... This _Congress_, while reaffirming the resolution on nonviolent
_non-cooperation_, declares that the entire or any part of the
non-violent _non-cooperation_ scheme, with the renunciation of voluntary
association with the government at one end, and the refusal
to pay taxes at the other, should be put in force at a time to be
determined by either the _Indian National Congress_ or the _All-India Congress Committee (AICC)_ (II, pp. 35--6).

Refusal to pay taxes to the government was thus the utmost
limit to which Gandhiji was prepared to go --- the limit to which
the rich peasants and even landlords were prepared to go with
him.

Those, however, were days in which the common people
refused to be thus restricted in their activities. The very fact
that a call for revolt had come --- non-violent though its character
was to be --- made the peasants, the artisans, the workers, etc.,
rise spontaneously against oppression. The strikes of the industrial
and plantation workers and the acute discontent
which began to manifest itself among the peasants, led to several
incidents which Gandhiji had hoped to prevent. Tendulkar
describes them as follows:

> Many of the new recruits who worked for the _Congress_ programme
lived in a kind of intoxication. The feeling of fear, oppression
and frustration completely disappeared. Even in the remote
villages, the people talked of the _Congress_ and _swaraj_, and what had
happened in the Punjab and the _Khilafat_. The word _Khilafat_ bore
a very strange meaning in most of the rural areas. People thought
it came from _khilaf_-an Urdu word meaning 'against', and so they
took it to mean 'opposed to government. There was a strange
mixture of nationalism, religion and mysticism (II, p. 46).

Gandhiji's reaction was characteristic of the man and the
movement which he was to lead for nearly three decades. Far
from being inspired by the tremendous response of the masses
to his call for _non-cooperation_ with the 'Satanic government',
he was alarmed at the lack of what he called 'that non-violent
and truthful atmosphere which alone can justify _mass civil disobedience_'.

He was alarmed at first during the _Rowlatt Act_ agitation
when 'I retraced my steps, called it a Himalayan miscalculation,
humbled myself before God and man, and stopped not merely
_mass civil disobedience_ but even my own, which I knew was
intended to be civil and non-violent'.

It was, however, not till the _Chauri Chaura_ incident of 1922[^4/2],
(which he called his 'bitterest humiliation') that he came to
realise that the _mass civil disobedience_ which he had visualised,
and for which he was preparing, could often go completely
beyond his control. He then decided to suspend the _civil disobedience_
movement.

_Chauri Chaura_ was not an isolated incident. It had been
preceded by the _Malabar rebellion_[^4/3], commonly known as the
Moplah rebellion, in which Gandhiji's call for _non-cooperation_
with the British had been integrated with the anti-landlord
demands of the peasantry and which, therefore, drew into its
fold tens of thousands of the oppressed peasantry of Malabar.
In several other parts of the country too, hundreds of youths
and elderly men responded to Gandhiji's call to boycott schools,
colleges and courts and to become wholetime messengers of the
spirit of _non-cooperation_. They went among the peasantry and
started voicing their demands for rent reduction, relief from
exorbitant taxation, etc. As a matter of fact, the very movement
which, according to Gandhiji, should be begun by 'the classes
who have hitherto moulded and represented public opinion',
was going beyond the limits set by those classes and becoming
a real national movement.

Further, once they were drawn into the movement, this
new class, the peasantry, threw up its own forms of struggle and
its own forms of organisation. This was clearly visible in the
Malabar rebellion in which, such typically peasant forms of
revolutionary action were resorted to as the burning of landlords'
records, the destruction of registry offices, attacks on government
offices, disarming of the police, setting up of people's
courts, and distribution of foodgrains and other things in the
landlords' mansions.

_Chauri Chaura_ also showed that, once the peasantry comes
face to face with the organs of state power, it, inevitably, is led
to forms of action outside the definition of _non-violence_ laid
down by Gandhiji.

Hence Gandhiji's confession: 'Madras (Malabar) did give
the warning, but I heeded it not. But God spoke clearly through
'_Chauri Chaura_'. He had no doubt that the police in _Chauri
Chaura_ 'had given much provocation'. It was this provocation
of the police that made 'the mob' set fire to the _thana_ and kill
policemen. But Gandhiji was not prepared to condone this
'mob violence', even if it were the result of police provocation.
It was clear to him that, once the peasants were aroused and
brought into action, such clashes between them and the organs
of British rule were certain to repeat themselves. This was so
terrible a prospect for him to even contemplate that he decided
that the very continuation of the movement would mean 'the
denial of our oath and sin against God'. Hence the decision to
suspend _civil disobedience_.


[^4/1]: Khilafat movement or the Caliphate movement, also known as the Indian Muslim movement (1919–24) to restore the caliph of the Ottoman Caliphate, who was considered the leader of the Muslims, as an effective political authority.

    In 1920 an alliance was made between Khilafat leaders and the _Indian National Congress_, the largest political party in India and of the nationalist movement.
    
    Although holding talks with the colonial government and continuing their activities, the Khilafat movement weakened as Muslims were divided between working for the _Congress_, the Khilafat cause and the _Muslim League_.
    
    The movement collapsed by late 1922 when Turkey gained a more favourable diplomatic position and moved towards Nationalism. By 1924 Turkey simply abolished the role of caliph.

[^4/2]: The _Chauri Chaura_ incident took place on 4 February 1922 at _Chauri Chaura_ in the Gorakhpur district of the United Provinces (modern-day Uttar Pradesh) in British India, when a large group of protesters participating in the _non-cooperation_ movement, were fired upon by the police. In retaliation the demonstrators attacked and set fire to a police station, killing all of its occupants. The incident led to the death of three civilians and 22 policemen. Mahatma Gandhi, who was strictly against violence, halted the _non-cooperation_ movement on the national level on 12 February 1922, as a direct result of this incident. In spite of Gandhi's decision, 19 arrested demonstrators were sentenced to death and 14 to imprisonment for life by the British colonial authorities.

[^4/3]: Malabar rebellion of 1921 started as a resistance against the British colonial rule in Malabar region of Kerala. The popular uprising was also against the prevailing feudal system controlled by elite Hindus. The British had appointed high caste Hindus in positions of authority to get their support, this led to the protest turning against the Hindus.

    There were a series of clashes between the Mappila peasantry and their landlords, supported by the colonial government, throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.
    
    Colonial troops were sent to the area and martial law imposed. For six months from August 1921, an estimated 10,000 people lost their lives, although official figures put the numbers at 2337 rebels killed, 1652 injured and 45,404 imprisoned. Unofficial estimates put the number imprisoned at almost 50,000 of whom 20,000 were deported, mainly to the penal colony in the Andaman Islands, while around 10,000 went missing.
