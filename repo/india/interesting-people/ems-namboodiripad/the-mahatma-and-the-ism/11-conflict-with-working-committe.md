# Conflict with _Working Committee_

The outbreak of the war very naturally raised the question
whether Gandhiji's attitude towards war had undergone change
between the years of the first and second world wars. For, it
will be recalled, being a votary of _non-violence_ had not prevented
him, in the period of the first world war, from acting as a recruiting
sergeant for British imperialism. Would he do the same
thing in the second world war as well ? This question was
actually put to him by a wellknown Congressman to which he
answered on 25 September 1939:

>My own personal reaction towards this war is one of greater
horror than ever before. I was not so disconsolate before, as I am
today. : But the greater horror would prevent me today from becoming
the self-appointed recruiting sergeant that I had become
during the last war. And yet, strange as it may appear, my sympathies
are wholly with the allies. Willy-nilly, this war is resolving
into one of such democracy, as the West has evolved, and totalitarianism, as is typified in Herr Hitler (V, p. 207).

It would thus appear. as if Gandhiji's attitude towards
Britain had not changed, as he would certainly like Britain to
win, but he would not help the British through arms, because
he had become more non-violent than in the days of the first
world war. This, however, is a picture which would be far from
the truth.

_Firstly_, Gandhiji's role as Britain's recruiting sergeant during
the first world war was by no means a personal act, but an
inseparable part of the policy then adopted by the entire Indian
_bourgeoisie_. Barring a handful of revolutionaries like those of
the _Ghadr Party_[^11/1] in America, and the so-called 'terrorists' of
Bengal and some other provinces, the entire leadership of the
national movement adopted the policy of helping Britain in the
war but demanding of her that she should concede the national
demand for _responsible government_.

_Secondly_, Gandhiji himself was frank enough to admit that
his own activities as recruiting agent were by no means divorced
from the political objective of winning _swaraj_. We have quoted
in an earlier chapter how Gandhiji had expressed the view that
'the easiest and straightest way to win _swaraj_ is to participate in
the defence of the empire. If the empire perishes, with it perish
our cherished aspirations. Some say that if we do not secure
rights just now we would be cheated afterwards. This power.
acquired in defending the empire will be the power that can
secure those rights'. He also added, 'if we are not prepared to
make this sacrifice for the empire and _swaraj_, it is no wonder if
we are regarded as unworthy of it'.

_Thirdly_, the two decades that elapsed between the first
and second world war had seen such a tremendous strengthening
of the Indian _bourgeoisie_ that it secured provincial
autonomy. The _Congress_ itself was able to form its ministries
in seven provinces. This strengthening of its position did by no
means satisfy the _bourgeoisie_; the _Congress_ therefore tried to
further extend its power through mass pressure on the one hand
and negotiations on the other. This was the strategy which the
_Congress_ worked out under Gandhiji's leadership in the latter
half of the 'thirties.

Naturally, therefore, the _Congress_ attitude towards war was
also governed by this strategy: while it was not prepared to
give unconditional support to the British in their war efforts as
it did during the first world war, the _Congress_ leadership made
it perfectly clear that they were prepared to give all possible
forms of support to the British, provided their own demand for
power at the centre was promised at least after the war.

This, however, was the position not only of the _Congress_
but of the other parties and organisations under _bourgeois_ or
landlord leadership, such as the _Muslim League_, the Hindu
Mahasabha, the Liberals, etc. These latter organisations had,
of course, their own grievances and demands against the _Congress_;
they were not prepared to support the _Congress_ as against
the British; but none of them was prepared to give that unconditional
support to the British which their predecessors had done
during the first world war.

It was this changed position of the _bourgeoisie_ as a whole,
and of the _Congress_ in particular, that was reflected in Gandhiji's
own change of attitude. For, behind the so-called 'greater horror'
towards war, which he developed since the first world war, lies
the fact that the class which he represented has now become
stronger than before, is now in a position to put pressure on the
British by withholding support in the difficult days of war.

If we are to accept Sri Tendulkar's story of the evolution
of Gandhiji's own and the _Congress Working Committee_'s
attitude towards war, there was a fundamental conflict between
the two in the first few months of the second world war. While
Gandhiji was for giving whatever support that the British needed
without any conditions, the _Working Committee_ was prepared
to give support only under certain conditions; on the other hand,
while the _Working Committee_ was prepared to carry on such
activities as recruitment of soldiers, etc., in support of the British,
provided the latter satisfied the conditions laid down by the
_Congress_, Gandhiji was prepared to give only 'moral' and 'non-violent'
support.

The basis of this difference between Gandhiji and the _Working
Committee_ was ostensibly their different attitudes to the
principle of _non-violence_. While the _working committee_ was
prepared to apply the principle of _non-violence_ only in the struggle
against the British government, while it was not prepared to
bind itself to the adoption of only non-violent means in dealing
with communal riots or goondaism or in resisting foreign invaders,
Gandhiji was insistent that all the problems of internal
order and resistance to external attack should also be solved on
the principles of _ahimsa_.

This difference in approach between Gandhiji and the
_Working Committee_ led to a furious controversy and internal
crisis in the _Congress_ in the first few months of the war. Gandhiji
and his biographer would therefore have us believe that the
closest followers and lieutenants of Gandhiji including Sardar
Patel, Rajagopalachari, etc., were coming into conflict with him
because they were not prepared to go as far as Gandhiji in the
acceptance and application of the moral principle of non-violence.

An examination of how this conflict developed would, however,
show that, behind this conflict on an ostensibly moral
question, lay the mundane question of what tactics should be
adopted in dealing with the British. It will also be seen that
there was a tacit division of labour between Gandhiji on the one
hand and the majority of the _Congress Working Committee_ on
the other. Consider, for example, the circumstances in which
the conflict originally broke out, resolved temporarily, then again
broke out in a more acute form and was once again resolved.

The conflict broke out in a mild form at the very first meeting
of the _Working Committee_ held after the outbreak of the
war. This was the occasion on which, according to Gandhiji,
'I was sorry to find myself alone in thinking that whatever support
was to be given to the British should be given unconditionally'
(V. p. 204). The circumstances in which the _Working
Committee_ refused to accept Gandhiji's advice were that war
had just broken out and that it was by no means clear how each
side in the war and each country on the side of the non-fascist
powers would react. The _Working Committee_, therefore, did
not want to bind itself to a course of action which would weaken
its position in any possible negotiations with the British. Such
a weakening of its position would undoubtedly be the result
both of offering unconditional support as well as of giving support
--- either conditional or unconditional --- on a purely non-violent
basis.

Subsequent developments, however, made it clear that the
British were far from being ready for negotiations and settlement
with the _Congress_ on the basis laid down by the _Congress_.
The pronouncements of the British Secretary of State --- Lord
Zetland, and the Indian Viceroy --- Lord Linlithgow, made it clear
that the demand of the _Congress_ for a clear declaration of British
policy as to whether democracy and self-determination would
apply to India was being countered by the British imperialists
with the claims made by the _Muslim League_, the _Scheduled
Castes Federation_, the Liberals, the princes, etc. These pronouncements,
said Gandhiji, had 'the old familiar flavour'; they
were relying on what he called the 'four pillars of British Indian
empire --- the European interests, the army, the princes and the
communal divisons' (V. p. 202). It was also becoming clear that
the use made by the British imperialists of the last of the 'four
pillars', the communal divisions, was becoming extremely uncomfortable
for the _Congress_: the _Muslim League_ particularly
was getting increasingly strengthened and was creating serious
obstacles in the path of the _Congress_ along with certain other
minorities.

All this convinced the _Congress Working Committee_ that
the British would not concede its demand unless greater pressure
was brought to bear on them. The Committee, therefore, first
called upon the _Congress_ ministers in the provinces to resign;
this was to be followed by other steps which were to prepare
the country for 'all eventualities'. In these circumstances, Gandhiji's
stand on _non-violence_, his appeal to the British and other
allied peoples not to meet Nazi militarism with counter-militarism,
but to resist the Nazis with non-violent means, came in
handy for the _Working Committee_. For, it served the purpose
of whipping up the anti-war sentiment of the people which was
already rising at a very fast rate and thus creating conditions in
which the British rulers would realise that it was by no means
easy for them to continue their war efforts.

In this period, therefore, not only was there no conflict between
Gandhiji and the _Working Committee_ but the _Working
Committee_ itself asked the people in general and _Congressmen_
in particular, to follow Gandhiji's instructions in order to prepare
themselves for the struggle. For the first time after the 1934
Bombay session, Gandhiji addressed a session of the _Congress_
at Ramgarh. The main resolution adopted at the session declared
that, in view of the policy adopted by the British government,
the _Congress_ and those under its influence could not help in the
prosecution of the war with men, money or material.

Gandhiji in his speech explained at length his own ideas of
how the struggle against war was to be organised and conducted.
Immediately following the Ramgarh session, Gandhiji gave the
slogan 'Every _Congress Committee_, A _Satyagraha Committee_'.
He gave detailed instructions as to how the _Congress committees_
and individual _Congressmen_ should function as _satyagrahis_.

Soon, however, the international situation changed. Britain
and her allies suffered a series of reverses at the hands of the
Nazis in May-June 1940: the whole of Western Europe fell under
the Nazi jackboots and there was great concern at the fate of
Britain itself. There was a change of government in Britain,
Churchill replacing Chamberlain. Questions began to be asked
in India whether these developments would lead to any change
in British policy towards India: Gandhiji himself said: 'While the
hourly butchery is going on in the West and peaceful homes are
being destroyed. ... I will leave no stone unturned to bring
about a peaceful and honourable settlement of the present deadlock'
(V, p. 349).

It was inevitable in these circumstances that the conflict
between Gandhiji and the _Working Committee_ should break out
in a more acute form than in the first few days after the outbreak
of the war. The majority of the _Working Committee_ felt that
here was a situation in which the very immensity of the danger
to Britain's own national security may force British statesmen to
seek a settlement with the _Congress_ in India. If that happened,
then it would obviously be inconvenient for the _Congress_ to be
saddled with the leadership of a man who declared that whatever
support is to be given to the British should be given on a
purely non-violent basis.

After prolonged discussions in which Gandhiji participated,
the _Working Committee_ announced on 21 June that they were
not able to extend the creed of _non-violence_ to national defence.
They therefore decided to absolve Gandhiji of his responsibility
of leading the country towards a non-violent struggle. The Committee
declared in its resolution: 'Mahatma Gandhi desires the
_Congress_ to be true to the creed of _non-violence_ and to declare
its unwillingness that India should maintain armed forces to
defend her freedom against external aggression or internal disorder',
while they themselves 'are unable to go to the full length
with Gandhiji'; but they recognise that he should be 'free to
pursue his great ideal in his own way and therefore absolve him
from the responsibility for the programme and activity which
the _Congress_ has to pursue' (V, p. 355).

This was soon followed by a meeting of the AICC at Poona
at which President Azad said:

>The _Congress_ is a political organisation, pledged to win the political
independence of the country. It is not an institution for organising
world peace. Honestly, we cannot go as far as Mahatma
Gandhi wants us to go. We admit that it is a weakness on our part,
but it is a weakness which we share with the entire humanity. We
have to solve every difficulty that presents itself to us, and we have
also to recognise the hard fact of Mahatma Gandhi's separation from
the _Congress_. We must bear it bravely (V, p. 384).

This was the session of the AICC which made the well-known
'_Poona Offer_' --- the offer that the _Congress_ was prepared
to participate in a national government in order to defend the
country against external aggression, provided, of course, the
British government declared its readiness to recognise the freedom
of India after the war.

This, however, did not meet with the expected response
from the side of the British. The '_Poona Offer_' of the _Congress_
in July was countered by the '_August Offer_' of the British in
which the Viceroy said that the new constitution should be
framed by Indians themselves but under two conditions: firstly,
the British obligations must be fulfilled and secondly, the minority
opinions must not be overrun. It was clear that the British
were still continuing the old policy of relying on their 'four pillars'
of rule. It is therefore not surprising if the _Congress_ felt, in
Tendulkar's words, 'badly let down'. It had openly disagreed
with Gandhiji, he continues, 'it expressed its inability to extend
the principle of _non-violence_ to the national defence of India
and had set forth the conditions which would enable it to throw
its full weight into the war effort'.

This open rejection of the _Congress_ offer by the British
government once again led to the resolution of the conflict between
Gandhiji and the _Working Committee_. The Committee
called an emergency meeting of the AICC at which President
Azad said :

>These events made us decide to again request Mahatma Gandhi
to assume the active leadership of the _Congress_. I am glad to inform
you that he has agreed to do this, as now there is no difference whatsoever
between him and the _Working Committee_. (V. p. 396).

The resolution drafted by Gandhiji was then adopted by the
AICC which declared:

>This committee firmly believes in the policy and practice of
_non-violence_ not only in the struggle for _swaraj_ but also, in so
far as this may be possible of application, in free India (V. p. 397).

It was this resolution of the AICC that led to the anti-war
individual _satyagraha_ launched in 1940--41. This _satyagraha_
launched first by Acharya Vinoba Bhave, then by other individual
_satyagrahis_ selected by Gandhiji himself, and then by several
_satyagrahis_ again selected by Gandhiji, continued for several
months. This form of _satyagraha_ did not, nor was it meant
to, do anything more than registering the protest of the nation
against its being drawn into the war efforts of Britain. Gandhiji
made it clear in several of his speeches and statements that the
struggle that was launched was not the struggle for independence,
'that for the time being, we should be satisfied with complete
freedom of speech and pen'. He also stated categorically
that he did not expect the struggle to be ended in victory: 'We
are resisting an authority that is itself struggling to fight for life
against a stubborn foe. ... Our struggle must be coterminous
at least with the Europeans'.

It is, however, significant that a few months later, in December
1941, the Gandhi-_Working Committee_ conflict did break
out once again: Gandhiji asked for being relieved of the responsibility
laid upon him by the _Bombay resolution_ (September 1940)[^11/2]
and the _Working Committee_ agreed to do so. The circumstances
under which this happened are described by Tendulkar
as follows:

>1) In mid-June, the international situation suddenly changed
>when Germany invaded Russia. In July, the expansion of the Viceroy's
>_Executive Council_ and the formation of a _National Defence
>Council_ were announced.
>
>2) By the late autumn of 1941, it had become obvious that something
>must be done quickly to improve political situation and enlist
>the full cooperation of the people in the war. Germany was advancing
>steadily into Russia and a German drive through the Near-East
>was expected. Japan had consolidated her position in Indo-China,
>and was preparing for a final plunge in the war. The mobilisation
>of India's vast resources and manpower had become an
>urgent military necessity.
>
>On the eve of the Pearl Harbour debacle, the British government
>made a conciliatory gesture (VI. pp. 14--17). (This conciliatory gesture
>was the release of the _civil disobedience_ prisoners including
>Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. --- E.M.S.N.)
>
>3) On December 23, 1941, the _Working Committee_ met at Bardoli
>to review the situation as it had developed since its last meeting held
>fourteen months ago. Japan having plunged in the war, the committee
>had to take a realistic view of the menacing situation (VI.
>p. 41).

This 'realistic view of the menacing situation' led Gandhiji
to write a letter to the _Working Committee_ in which he expressed
his surprise at the difference between his interpretation of the
_Bombay resolution_ and that of others. He went on to say:

>On re-reading the Bombay resolution I found that the differing
members were right and that I had read into it a meaning which its
letter could not bear. The discovery of the error makes it impossible
for me to lead the _Congress_ in the struggle for resistance to the war
effort on the grounds in which _non-violence_ was not indispensable.
... You will, therefore, please relieve me of the responsibility laid
upon me by the _Bombay resolution_. (VI. p. 42).

The _Working Committee_, of course, readily accepted his
suggestion and thus once again cleared the path for any negotiations
which the government may want to initiate.

>4) Events were moving with lightning speed. The allies suffered
>reverses both in Asia and Europe. ... The debacle of the British
>forces in Burma was actually felt in China. In February 1942,
>Marshal and Madame Chiang Kai-shek visited Delhi and boldly
>addressed an outspoken appeal to Britain and India. The Marshal
>appealed to the rulers to grant political power to the Indians (VI.
>p. 73).

5) All these developments forced the British to initiate
negotiations.

>When Rangoon fell on March 7, 1942, it seemed as if the tide of
Japanese conquest would soon be sweeping into Bengal and Madras.
On March 11, Churchill announced that the War Cabinet had agreed
on a plan for India and that Sir Stafford Cripps had consented to go
to India to ascertain whether this plan would secure a 'reasonable
and practical' measure of acceptance and 'thus promote the concentration
of all Indian thought and energies' on defence against Japan.
(VI. p. 87).


[^11/1]: _Ghadar Party/Movement_ was an association of expatriate Indians formed in 1913 to overthrow British rule in India. Mostly composed of Punjabi Indians who lived in West Coast of the United States & Canada.

    Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, some Ghadar party members returned to Punjab to incite armed revolution for Indian Independence. _Ghadarites_ smuggled arms into India and incited Indian troops to mutiny against the British. This uprising, known as _Ghadar Mutiny_, was unsuccessful, and 42 mutineers were executed..

[^11/2]: In a meeting at Bombay in September 1940, the Congress Working Committee passed the “Bombay Resolution” withdrawing the Poona Offer.

    Congress turned to Gandhi for help. Gandhi then organized the _individual non-violence_ movement, whereby individuals selected by him made anti-war speeches & were promptly jailed by the Government. Shortly before Christmas, 1941, these prisoners were released by Government of India.
    
    On December 30, 1941, the _Congress Working Committee_, in the _Bardoli resolution_ signified its willingness to cooperate in the prosecution of the war, provided the British Government makes some concessions in return. Early in January 1942, the All-India Congress Committee ratified the Bardoli resolution.
    
    Gandhi endorsed the Bardoli resolution but at the same time asked to be relieved of Congress leadership. For quite some time prior to the adoption of the resolution there had been considerable dissatisfaction within the party regarding satyagraha (the individual nonviolence movement). Many party members considered the movement unrealistic and ineffective, and opposition to it was growing. Furthermore, Gandhi found that he was receiving only half-hearted cooperation from some of those he had selected to participate in the movement. Apparently, he realized that he could not prevent the adoption of the resolution but felt that his non-violent principles would not permit him to participate in a policy of cooperation with the war effort. He therefore renounced his active leadership in the party but, in endorsing it, Gandhi retains a nominal leadership and was able to nominate Nehru as his “legal heir”.
