# Salt _Satyagraha_ phase

The nation was indeed entering upon a new era. A new
upsurge of mass struggle was unfolding itself. Thousands of
young men and women who had felt frustrated at the suspension
of the 1922 _civil disobedience_ movement came forward to
offer themselves as disciplined soldiers in the cause of independence.
The call given by the _working committee_ to observe
26 January 1930, as the 'Independence Day' evoked glorious
mass demonstrations. The inspiring document issued by the
_working committee_ headed by Jawaharlal Nehru (_the Independence
Pledge_) was not only a powerful indictment of the
misdeeds and atrocities of the alien rulers, but a stirring call to
the patriotic youth of the country to go forward till the last
vestiges of foreign rule were eliminated. Towns and villages
vied with each other in celebrating the historic day. In the
cities led by Calcutta and Bombay scores of thousands met and
took the great resolve and in the countryside thousands of villagers
assembled at numerous village meetings (III, p. 12).

The decision to break the salt laws and the march to Dandi
which Gandhiji undertook were looked upon by the people as
the beginning of a big mass movement for securing _complete
independence_. And when the campaign for mass defiance of
the salt laws started, first at Dandi by Gandhiji himself and later
by other leaders in several places all over the country, men,
women and children flocked to witness the defiance of the
British-made law. Undaunted by arrests, lathi charges and
firings, people flocked to the banner of the _Congress_ and participated
in the movement.

The mood of the people can be gauged from the following
description:

>There was firing in Calcutta, Madras, Karachi and lathi charges
>all over India. Processions and meetings were banned. People retaliated
>by intensive picketing of foreign cloth shops and liquor
>booths. ...
>
>On 18 April police armouries at Chittagong were raided. The
>revolutionary upsurge reached its highest point in Peshawar where
>huge mass demonstrations were held on 23 April. The next day,
>Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, leader of the newly-formed Khudai
>Khidmatgar --- Servants of God --- or the Red Shirts, was arrested.
>Thousands of people surrounded the place of his detention and there
>was a mammoth demonstration in Peshawar. Armoured cars were
>sent to cow down angry demonstrators; one armoured car was burnt,
>its occupants escaping; thereupon wholesale firing on the crowds
>was followed by hundreds of deaths and casualties. Two platoons
>of the Second Battalion of the 18th Royal Garhwali Rifles, Hindu
>troops in the midst of a Muslim crowd, refused to fire, broke ranks,
>and a number of them handed over their arms (III, p. 44).

Following Gandhiji's arrest the storm burst.

>Gandhiji's arrest led to _hartals_ and strikes all over India. Some
>fifty thousand textile workers downed tools in Bombay. Railway
>workers too joined the demonstration. There was a mammoth procession
>impressive enough to induce the police to retire from the
>scene. The cloth merchants decided on a six-day _hartal_. In Poona,
>where Gandhiji was interned, resignations from honorary offices and
>from services were announced at frequent intervals.
>
>The revolutionary zeal was at its zenith. In Sholapur, the
>people held possession of the town for a week, replacing the police
>and establishing their own rule, until the martial law was proclaimed.
>There was trouble in Mymensingh, Calcutta, Karachi, Lucknow,
>Multan, Delhi, Rawalpindi, Mardan and Peshawar. Troops, aeroplanes,
>tanks, guns and ammunition were brought on the scene and
>freely used in the North-West Frontier Frovince. In June, 500 tons
>of bombs were dropped over the Pathans but ir spirit remained
>uncrushed. The number of Red Shirts increased from a couple of
>hundreds to 80,000. Repression in the Punjab gave birth to the
>Ahrar Party, a spirited Muslim organisation (III, p. 49).

However, while the people were thus magnificently responding
to the call of the _Congress_ its leadership headed by
Gandhiji was doing its best to divert their enthusiasm and militancy
to channels which were safe for the _bourgeoisie_. This
they did in several ways.

_Firstly_, though they were forced to accept the immediate
objective of _complete independence_, in actual practice, they
gave it up before the ink was dry on _the Independence Pledge_.
In his comments on the Viceroy's announcement, Gandhiji said
that he was prepared to 'put off _civil disobedience_ if Britain
would grant the substance, if not the outward form, of self-government'.
He demanded eleven things: total prohibition;
restoration of the exchange rate to ls. 4d.; 50 percent reduction
of land revenue; reduction of military expenditure by at least
50 percent to begin with; reduction of civil services salaries by
half; a protective tariff against foreign cloth; enactment of a
coastal reservation bill; discharge of all political prisoners, not
condemned for murder or attempted murder; abolition or control
of the C.I.D.; and issue of licences for fire-arms for self-defence,
subject to popular control.

Enumerating these eleven points, Gandhiji said: 'Let the
Viceroy satisfy us with regard to these very simple but vital
needs of India. He will then hear no talk of _civil disobedience_'.

_Secondly_, despite the talk of _mass civil disobedience_, they
tried to restrict the scope of _direct action_ to a limited number of
_satyagrahis_. Gandhiji said addressing the students of _Gujarat
Vidyapith_:

>We rely not on numerical strength, but on the strength of
character, and the _civil disobedience_ resolution was moved more
because I had faith in a few men sacrificing themselves for the cause
than in the number of men coming forward in response to the call
(III, p. 2).

_Thirdly_, precisely in order to restrict the scope of the movement,
they refrained from incorporating the demands of the
millions of workers, peasants and other sections of the toiling
people in the charter of demands which, according to Gandhiji,
was 'the substance of independence'. The above noted eleven
points, for example, do not include anything which the workers
or peasants demand from their employers, landlords and usurers.
The only demand which is of direct interest to the peasants is
the 50 percent reduction in land revenue. Such questions as
rent reduction, moratorium on debts, stoppage of evictions, adequate
wages and salaries for the workers and employees, etc.,
were not considered.

It is true that a year later at the _Karachi Congress_ the _Congress_
leaders accepted many of the demands of the toiling people
in the well-known resolution on fundamental rights. Acceptance
of such demands as living wage for industrial workers,
limited hours of work, healthy conditions of work, protection
against the economic consequences of old age, sickness and
unemployment, substantial reduction in agricultural rent or
revenues paid by the peasantry and in case of uneconomic
holdings exemption from rent for such period as may be necessary,
were incorporated in the _Congress_ programme. It should,
however, be noted that, in his speech moving the resolution,
Gandhiji said:

>_This resolution is meant for those who are not legislators, who
are not interested in the intricate questions of constitution, and who
will not take an active part in the administration of the country. It
is meant to indicate to the poor inarticulate Indians the broad
features Swaraj or Ram Raj_. Before my march to Dandi, I had
included some of these features in my eleven points. These have
been made more comprehensive. They are now presented to you in
a separate resolution. They were advisedly omitted from the main
resolution because that would have made the mandate for the delegation
burdensome (III, pp. 112--13. emphasis added).

In other words, the Karachi programme was formulated
with a two-fold purpose: firstly, to enable the _Congress_ leadership
to rouse the toiling people and delude them with the idea
that the _Congress_ was fighting for these demands of theirs;
secondly, to use the strength of popular support thus acquired
to secure from the British government the demands incorporated
in the eleven points.

Above all, the adoption of the immediate objective of _complete
independence_, or the decision to launch _mass civil disobedience_,
did not make the slightest change in the technique
which Gandhiji had evolved ever since the days of the South
African _satyagraha_ --- the technique of negotiations with the imperialists backed by controlled mass action. In words as well as
in action, he made it repeatedly clear that his primary objective
was to have a settlement with the British government. He stated
in his well-known letter to the Viceroy before launching the _civil
disobedience_ movement:

>Conversion of a nation that has consciously or unconsciously
>preyed upon another, far more numerous, far more ancient, and no
>less cultured than itself, is worth any amount of risk.
>
>I have deliberately used the word conversion. For, my ambition
>is no less than to convert the British people through _non-violence_,
>and thus make them see the wrong they have done to India (III,
>p. 22).

It was these three features of the _mass civil disobedience_
movement, launched by the _Congress_ under Gandhiji's leadership
in 1930, that was sought to be cleverly used by the British
government through its two viceroys --- Lord Irwin and Lord
Willingdon. The tactics adopted by the British imperialists in
1930--32 may be briefly summed up thus:

To begin with, they adopted what is commonly known as
the 'dual policy', the policy of repression against the people and
negotiations with the leaders. It was this dual policy that enabled
them to make the _Congress_ leadership agree to call off
the _civil disobedience_ movement in 1931, and to send their
representative to the second _Round Table Conference_.

Having made the _Congress_ agree to withdraw. the _civil disobedience_
movement and to participate in the _Round Table
Conference_, they adopted the policy of repression in India, combined
with such manoeuvres among the _non-Congress_ delegates
at the _Round Table Conference_ as would isolate the _Congress_
representative. This enabled the British government to make
out to the world that there was a very complicated problem of
constitutional reform in India which the Indian leaders were not
able to solve and that, therefore, the British government itself
had to give its solution --- what was called _the communal award_.

Having thus isolated the _Congress_ at the _Round Table Conference_
and having 'exposed' the incapacity of the _Congress_ to
solve 'intricate' questions of constitutional reforms, the imperialist
rulers launched a direct and ferocious attack on the _Congress_.
By the time Gandhiji came back from the _Round Table
Conference_, provinces like UP and North-West Frontier Province
had already come under _ordinance rule_[^7/1] and several top leader's
of the _Congress_, including Jawaharlal Nehru, had already been
clapped into jail. All the attempts that Gandhiji made to negotiate
with the Viceroy and to settle the issues of conflict proved
abortive. When Gandhiji and the _Congress working committee_
did, therefore, decide to end the state of truce arrived at in
March 1931 and to resume _civil disobedience_, the whole country
was made the victim of an unheard-of state of repression.

These tactics of the imperialists were quite naturally sought
to be combated by the leadership of the _Congress_. The way this
was done is an unmistakable indication of how the philosophy
and technique of _Gandhism_ worked in actual practice.

_In the stage of preparation for and launching of civil disobedience_
in the form of defiance of the salt laws, they tried to
rouse the anti-imperialist consciousness in people but also tried
to temper it with the insistence on _non-violence_, including the
philosophy of 'converting' the British imperialists. The well-known
Independence Pledge asserted that 'the British government
has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and
spiritually. ... We held it to be a crime against man and God to
submit any longer to a rule that has caused this four-fold disaster
to our country. It added, 'We recognise however that the most
effective way of gaining our freedom is not through violence'.

It was in keeping with this that the very eleven points were
drafted: they were directed against British exploitation and
would, therefore, rally all sections of the people including the
_bourgeoisie_, but they were not directed against the Indian exploiters
and would, therefore, not lead to any outbreak of what
is known as 'mob violence'.

When this stage was over and _a new stage of negotiations
with the British government_ opened, they used all the avenues
of negotiation in order to bring about such a settlement as would
strengthen the economic and political position of the _bourgeoisie_
vis-a-vis the British government. The terms on the basis of
which Gandhiji and the two Nehrus said they were prepared to
call off the _civil disobedience_ movement were that (a) India's
right to secede at will from the British empire should be recognised
in so many words; (b) a completely national government
responsible to the Indian people should have control
and should realise all the eleven points raised in Gandhiji's letter
to the Viceroy; and (c) India should have the right to refer to
an independent tribunal British claims, concessions and the like,
including the so-called public debt of India.

However, when it was found that a settlement on such
terms was impossible, they agreed to accept a truce which
strengthened the political and organisational position of the
_Congress_ in the country. The very fact that the mighty British
government negotiated with the _Congress_ and came to a written
agreement with its representative; that such a settlement included
provisions which partially conceded the demands of the
_Congress_ (like the permission to manufacture salt in certain
areas ); that the overwhelming majority of political prisoners
were released --- these were sufficient to strengthen the _Congress_
and enable it to carry on its struggle for independence.

They therefore tried zealously to safeguard the gains
secured by them through the truce and told the people that they
had accepted the terms of truce only because it would enable
them to still further strengthen the struggle for independence.
Since, however, this was a position which the bureaucrats did
not like, there were interminable conflicts between the _Congress_
and the bureaucrats on such issues as release of political prisoners,
enforcement of state laws, collection of land revenue, etc.

On every one of these issues, the _Congress_ leadership tried
its utmost to secure the redressal of grievances and always held
out the threat that they would not send their representative to
the second _Round Table Conference_ if the truce terms were not
strictly implemented by the government. It was because some
concessions were made from the side of the government that
they ultimately allowed Gandhiji to go and attend the _Round
Table Conference_.

Both at the second _Round Table Conference_ as well as later,
they sought to combat the communal disruption organised by
the British by a policy of concessions to the Muslims and certain
other minorities. It was, however, found that the disruption at
the second _Round Table Conference_ had laid the basis for the
British government to start a frontal attack on the _Congress_.
This naturally provoked it to resume _direct action_. But no
sooner had the second _civil disobedience_ movement started than
the most farsighted of them, Gandhiji, started evolving new
tactics.

It was on 4 January 1932 that Gandhiji was arrested. By
11 March, however, he had come to the conclusion that there
was something more important for him than the effective conduct
of the _civil disobedience_ movement for securing _complete
independence_. In a letter to the secretary of state dated 11
March, he wrote :

>You will perhaps recollect that at the end of my speech at the
_Round Table Conference_ when the minorities' claim was presented,
I had said that I should resist with my life the grant of separate
electorate to the depressed classes. This was not said in the heat
of the moment or by way of rhetoric. It was meant to be a serious
statement (III, p. 195).

_The communal award_ given by the British prime minister,
he said, (according to which separate electorates were to be
given to the depressed classes) would therefore force him to
undertake a fast unto death.

That letter was the beginning of a process of the _Congress_
slowly disengaging itself from the _mass civil disobedience_ movement
and adopting a new programme of _parliamentary struggle_
on the one hand, and _constructive programme_ on the other. On
the rejection of his demand by the British government and the
final acceptance and giving _the communal award_ Gandhiji
undertook a fast unto death.

This fast led to a conference of _Congress_ and _non-Congress_
leaders, including leaders of the depressed classes, which came
to an agreement enabling an amendment to be passed to _the
communal award_ in relation to the depressed classes.

As one of the provisions of the agreement was a countrywide
mass campaign for the eradication of untouchability and
for the amelioration of the condition of the depressed classes,
Gandhiji was allowed to carry on _Harijan_ work from inside jail.
This diverted the energy of a large number of _Congressmen_ outside
jail from the job of organising the _civil disobedience_ movement
into that of organising _Harijan_ welfare work.

As Gandhiji said that he was not entirely satisfied with the
progress of _Harijan_ work, he undertook a 21-days' fast in May.
1933 as a measure of _self-purification_. This led to his release
from jail, an event which he used to advise the then actingpresident
of the _Congress_ to suspend _civil disobedience_.

Since, however, these gestures of Gandhiji and the actingpresident
of the _Congress_ did not have the desired effect of making
the government relax its policy of repression, Gandhiji
advised the resumption of _civil disobedience_, but not on a mass
scale. He put restrictions on the manner in which it was to be
conducted. He himself offered individual _civil disobedience_
and the whole country was put on the rails of individual, as
opposed to mass, _civil disobedience_.

Again, Gandhiji undertook a fast in jail since the government
refused this time to give him facilities to carry on _Harijan_
work from inside jail. He had once more to be released, since;
at one stage, his physical condition became really serious. On
release, he said that he was going to work exclusively for the
_Harijan_ cause and keep away completely from political work.

The last few months of 1933 and the beginning of 1934 were
used by Gandhiji for an intensive tour of the country for the
ostensible purpose of collecting funds for _Harijan_ work. However,
this was utilised by him and the other leaders of the _Congress_
who were outside jail to have informal consultations on the
future of _civil disobedience_. Some of the _Congress_ leaders had
already met among themselves and were thinking of organising
a _Swaraj Party_. They naturally sought Gandhiji's advice. The
result of these confabulations was that on 7 April 1934 Gandhiji
issued a statement in which he said:

>... I must advise all _Congressmen_ to suspend civil resistance for
_swaraj_, as distinguished from the specific grievances. They should
leave it to me alone. It should be resumed by others in my lifetime,
only under my direction, unless one arises claiming to know
the science better than I do and inspires confidence. I express this
opinion as the author and initiator of _satyagraha_. Henceforth, therefore,
those who have been impelled to civil resistance for _swaraj_
under my advice directly given or indirectly inferred, will please
desist from civil resistance (III, p. 319).

This statement of Gandhiji was followed by a statement
from the government which assured the _Congress_ that there
would be 'no obstacle to a meeting of the AICC or, if _Congress_
leaders so prefer, of the _Indian National Congress_ for the purpose
of ratifying the statement of policy recently made by Mr.
Gandhi and calling off _civil disobedience_'.

The stage was thus set for the May meeting of the AICC
which ratified Gandhiji's statement withdrawing _civil disobedience_
and decided to participate in the forthcoming elections to
the central legislature.
