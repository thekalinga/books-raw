# Retirement

The very narration of these events will inevitably raise the
question: why did Gandhiji act in this manner? Why is it that,
at the very time when the country was witnessing a big mass
action directed against the national enemy, the supreme leader
of that action preferred to pay attention to a relatively minor
issue (the issue of the untouchables' position in the social and
state structure) and make it the basis for a social reform, rather
than a political mass movement? Why is it that he took the
first available opportunity to advise the suspension of _mass civil
disobedience_?

These are questions for which no answer can be found if
one is to base oneself on Gandhiji's pronouncements on _satyagraha_.
The only contingency in which his theory of _satyagraha_
visualised the withdrawal of mass action for a just cause was
when that action had taken, or was in danger of taking 'violent'
forms. It was this danger that Gandhiji had stressed, as the
reason for the suspension of the movement in 1922. Such a
contingency did not exist in 1932. Despite the highly provocative
and brutal actions perpetrated by foreign rulers, the _satyagrahis_
remained as peaceful and non-violent as Gandhiji had
asked them to be.

The thousands of young men and women _satyagrahis_ had
scrupulously observed all of Gandhiji's instructions. Thus it
came as a blow to them when they learned of Gandhiji's decision
to go on a fast on the question of separate electorates for the untouchables;
still more severe was the shock when they subsequently
learned that he had decided to devote his whole time
and energy to the cause of _Harijan_ uplift. They felt betrayed
and angry when they saw the foremost leader of the antiimperialist
_political_ action devoting himself, and asking his followers
to devote themselves, to this relatively minor _social issue_.

Why did Gandhiji decide on this apparently reckless change
in tactics and thereby invite the acute dissatisfaction of thousands
of his followers? Is it because he was 'more concerned
with social reform than political struggles', as is asserted by
some people? The answer is 'No'. Gandhiji was, above all, the
astute political leader of a class --- the _bourgeoisie_, in whose class
interests he always acted. His September 1932 fast and the
sÃ¼bsequent activity on the ostensibly _social_ issue of _Harijan_ uplift
was part and parcel of his carefully worked out _tactics_ with
a view to meeting a concrete _political situation_.

Let us recall, in this connection, how the 1932 struggle came
to be launched. The second _Round Table Conference_, at which
Gandhiji represented the _Congress_, ended in a break between
the _Congress_ and the British government. There was no other
way open for a self-respecting national organisation like the
_Congress_, under these circumstances, than to launch mass action.
The government for its part was determined on a showdown
with the _Congress_ and took adequate steps to see that the story
of 1930--31 (_Congress_-government negotiations ) was not repeated.
In other words, the 1932 struggle was something which had
been forced on Gandhiji and his colleagues of the _working
committee_.

Gandhiji was of opinion that, if this situation was allowed
to continue, then the government would be able to have its way;
frame a constitution on the lines on which it wanted. This constitution
would be utilised by the _non-Congress_ parties, including
the communal ones, to weaken the _Congress_, who in their
turn, would be utilised by the British to deny the national
demand. He wanted to prevent this contingency and, therefore,
to seek all possible ways of opening negotiations with the British,
and, naturally, of withdrawing the _civil disobedience_ movement.

It was to this end that he chose an issue which was at once
of a social as well as of a political character --- separate or joint
electorate for the untouchables. While this gave him an opportunity
to appear before the people and do something for social
reform, it also gave an opening for negotiations with the government
on one aspect of constitutional reform. The government,
however, took him at his word, took his interest in the uplift of
the untouchables as a matter of pure social reform and refused
to open negotiations on the political question. Gandhiji, for his
part, used even this little opportunity to strengthen his contact
with his colleagues and the people in general.

Subsequent events, however, proved that his interest in the
cause of _Harijan_ welfare was not merely social. At the first
opportunity after coming out of jail (in May 1933) he used his
authority over the _Congress_ president to withdraw _mass civil
disobedience_. But, even this opening for negotiations on the
political issue was turned down by the British who wanted
nothing but total surrender from the _Congress_. He had, therefore,
to preserve his own, as well as the organisation's selfrespect
by launching _civil disobedience_, though not on a mass
scale. Once again, however, he took the first opportunity to give
a hint to the government by announcing his decision to keep
silent on political issues for a year.

His interest in the _Harijan_ cause and the activities flowing
therefrom should be considered as nothing but an effort on his
part, to disengage the _Congress_ from the situation in which it
had been placed following its break with the government. It
was an effort to find points of contact with the British, pursue
the negotiations on constitutional reforms started and temporarily
broken at the second _Round Table Conference_, and to reorganise
the _Congress_ with a view to enabling it to meet this
new situation.

That is precisely why, unlike in 1922 when even such 'moderate'
right-wing leaders as Motilal Nehru protested against
Gandhiji's action in suspending _civil disobedience_, the 1934
advice of Gandhiji on the withdrawal of the movement was
heartily endorsed by the entire right-wing leadership of the
_Congress_. Furthermore, unlike the 1920's when the _Congress_
leadership was split into the _Swarajists_ and the _no-changers_, the
1930's saw an almost complete unanimity in the leadership on
the question of parliamentary work. Gandhiji himself stated in
1934 that 'parliamentary mentality has come to stay'. The entire
right-wing leadership of the _Congress_ was one in its view that
the constitution that was then being drafted was the biggest
political issue and that any negative attitude towards it would
be dangerous. Hence, it was not a _Swaraj Party_ outside the
_Congress_ as in the 1920's, but the _All-India Congress Committee (AICC)_
itself that appointed a parliamentary board of its own, which
was to guide _Congress_ activities with regard to the elections.

While there was thus an almost complete unanimity in the
leadership of the _Congress_ regarding the tactics that should be
pursued, the _Congress_ as an organisation was by no means united.
A process of intense discussion had started in the ranks of
the _Congress_. The tactics pursued by Gandhiji ever since his
September 1932 fast was being very seriously challenged. So
were the activities of certain right-wing leaders who had taken
the initiative for the formation of the _Swaraj Party_, subjected to
sharp criticism. Never before was discontent against the policies
of the _Congress_ leadership so widespread and so acute as in
1933--34. The extent to which this had gone may be gauged
from a letter which Jawaharlal Nehru wrote to Gandhiji in 1934.
He wrote:

>And so the flag of Indian freedom was entrusted with all pomp
>and circumstance to those who had actually hauled it down at the
>height of our national struggle at the bidding of the enemy; to those
>who had proclaimed from the house-tops that they had given up
>politics --- for politics were unsafe then --- but who emerged with a
>jump to the front ranks when politics became safe.
>
>And what of the ideals they set forth before them, speaking as
>they did on behalf of the _Congress_ and the nation? A pitiful hotch-potch,
>avoiding real issues, toning down, as far as they dared, even
>the political objective of the _Congress_, expressing a tender solicitude
>for every vested interest, bowing down to many a declared enemy
>of freedom, but showing great truculence and courage in facing the
>advanced and fighting elements in the _Congress_ ranks (III, p. 381).

As for the 1934 decision on the withdrawal of the movement
and on the adoption of the _parliamentary programme_, the news
of it came to Nehru 'with such a stab of pain, I felt the chords of
allegience that had bound me to him for many years had snapped'.
Tendulkar adds, 'This was the reaction of many _Congressmen_'.

The opposition of rank and file _Congressmen_, however, did
not take the form of opposition to the _parliamentary programme_
as such. Like the leadership, they too realised the importance of
using parliamentary institutions as weapons in the struggle for
freedom. They had no more fascination for the programme of
boycott of legislatures than the leaders. But the question was:
what are the parliamentary institutions to be used for? Are they
to be used as avenues for reopening negotiations with the British,
or are they to be used as the means of further strengthening the
anti-imperialist mass movement? Again, is the utilisation of parliamentary
institutions to become the main, if not the sole, means
of strengthenng the anti-imperialist movement, or is it to be subordinated
to the mobilisation of the people, particularly of the
workers, peasants and the middle classes, in uncompromising
struggle against imperialism and its agents? These were the questions
which were agitating tens of thousands of ordinary _Congressmen_.

These developments inside the _Congress_ organisation, together
with such major developments in the national and international
fields as the unprecedented crisis of the capitalist system
(1929--33 world economic crisis), the successful implementation
of the First Five Year Plan in the Soviet Union, the rise of
Nazism in Germany and similar forces in several capitalist
countries, the heroic defence of the cause of communism by the
communists in the Meerut Conspiracy Case[^8/1], etc., attracted
thousands of revolutionary youth towards the communist ideology.

It was this that facilitated the slow but sure strengthening
of the various communist groups in the country and their joining
together to form the first All-India centre of the _Communist
Party of India (CPI)_ towards the end of 1933. A few months after
the formation of the All-India centre, the Government of India
came down with its heavy hand and declared the Party illegal.
This action did hamper the expansion and strengthening of the
CPI, although it could not prevent the thousands of young anti-imperialists',
disillusioned with Gandhian leadership, from
thinking on the more radical lines of socialism. The _Congressmen_
who thought on these lines got together and decided to
form the _Congress Socialist Party_ at a conference held in May 1934.

It was the realisation that the new socialist trend growing
inside the _Congress_ had a powerful spokesman in Jawaharlal
Nehru that led Gandhiji towards the adoption of a new programme
--- a programme that was in the beginning shocking to
the mass of _Congressmen_ but which later on proved to be of
enormous help to those _Congressmen_ who wanted to fight the
new radical trends in the _Congress_.

In September 1934, Gandhiji wrote to Sardar Patel :

>Then there is the growing group of socialists. Jawaharlal is
their undisputed leader. I know pretty well what he wants and
stands for. ... The socialist group represents his views more or less,
though probably their mode of execution is not exactly his. That
group is bound to grow in influence and importance. ... I have
fundamental differences with them on the programme published
in their authorised pamphlets. But I would not, by reason of the
moral pressure I may be able to exert, suppress the spread of the
ideas propounded in their literature. My remaining in the _Congress_
would amount to the exercise of such pressure (III, pp. 387--8).

Gandhiji's alternative was to retire from the _Congress_.
Explaining this proposal, he issued a long statement on 17 September
1934 in the course of which he outlined the main points
of difference between him and what he termed the '_intelligentsia_'.
He reaffirmed his faith in _non-violence_ as a creed,
and not as a policy, as in the case of the mass of _Congressmen_.
He reiterated his faith in the spinning wheel and _khadi_. He
expressed his differences with what he called the 'parliamentary
party', though, as in the case of the socialists, he would not
exert his moral pressure against their growth. Hence the feeling
that he required 'complete detachment and absolute freedom
of action' in order to pursue the 'experiment in _satyagraha_' to
which his whole life was dedicated.

The proposed retirement of Gandhiji from the _Congress_
naturally raised intense discussion. The one topic which was
uppermost in the minds of the delegates who assembled at
Bombay in October for the All-India session was Gandhiji's
retirement. Repeated appeals were made to him to reconsider
his decision but he remained adamant. The session passed a
resolution reiterating its 'confidence in the leadership of
Mahatma Gandhi'. It stated, further on, that the _Congress_:

>is emphatically of opinion that he should reconsider his decision to
retire from the _Congress_. But inasmuch as efforts to persuade him
in that behalf have failed, this _Congress_, while reluctantly accepting
his decision, places on record its deep sense of gratitude for the
unique services rendered by him to the nation and notes, with satisfaction,
his assurance that his advice and his guidance will be
available to the _Congress_ whenever necessary (III, p. 372).

His retirement from the _Congress_ was stated to be for the
double purpose of allowing him to devote his entire time and
energy for the _constructive programme_, and to enable the parliamentarians,
the socialists and other groups inside the _Congress_
to carry on their activities without the danger of his moral
pressure being exerted on them. He therefore made it a point
to give no public statements or speeches on any controversial
political subject. The columns of the _Harijan_, in which he
continuously wrote; the innumerable speeches which he delivered
during his countrywide tours; the press interviews that he
frequently gave and the bulk of his correspondence were all
related to such subjects as _khadi_, village industries, untouchability,
cleanliness, cow protection, birth control, and any number
of other subjects which bore no relation to current political issues.

In reality, however, he exerted his influence in the political
life of the _Congress_, since he was available at all times for
'consultation' by _Congressmen_. The leading members of the
_working committee_ rushed to him for advice on all important
political questions. His retirement from the _Congress_, therefore,
was by no means retirement from political activity. This he
made clear in the course of discussions which he had with his
devoted colleagues and followers. For example, at a meeting of
the _Gandhi Seva Sangh_ held in February 1936, he said :

>I see that there is a tendency to believe that these programmes
(constructive and political) are mutually exclusive or antagonistic.
Much of our misunderstanding arises out of this belief. The worker
in the constructive field looks down upon the political programme
and vice versa. But really there is no such opposition. I had thought
that it was clear by now to every worker that there was no absolute
division between the so-called political and the so-called _constructive
programmes_. In our method of work there are no water-tight compartments
(IV, p. 66).

In all his speeches and writings, he emphasised the point
that the _Harijan_, village industries and other parts of the _constructive
programme_ were integral parts of his programme of
non-violent struggle for the establishment of a free India. That
being so, there was no question of his retiring from politics.

While thus tendering advice to, and striving to mould the
policies of the _Congress_ leadership, Gandhiji also tried to advise
and influence the leaders of the rising _Congress Socialist Party_.

In a letter which he wrote to Acharya Narendra Deva, he
advised the socialists to consult Jawaharlal Nehru.

>I feel sure that if he was in our midst \[Nehru was at that time
in jail\], he would have hastened slowly. I suggest your presenting
the country with "practical" socialism in keeping with Indian conditions,
instead of _scientific socialism_ as your programme has been
called. I am glad that the programme you have given me is but
draft, though prepared by an influential committee appointed for
the purpose. It would be wise, if when you settle your programme
finally, you will associate with you men who have socialist leanings
and have experience of actual conditions (III, Photostat, p. 344. emphasis added).

This advice to the _Congress_ socialists to consider Jawaharlal
Nehru as their leader and act under his guidance was no
accident, nor was it merely an expression of his personal regard
for Nehru. It was part and parcel of a definite policy which
Gandhiji was pursuing. It will be useful, in this connection, to
recall that, at the time when he had recommended the election
of Jawaharlal Nehru for the presidentship of the _Lahore Congress_,
he had told the militant youth of the country that Nehru's
election should be considered as a tribute to their services. He
had compared them with steam 'which becomes a mighty
power only when it allows itself to be imprisoned in a strong
little reservoir and produces tremendous motion', adding, 'even
so should the youth of the country of their free will allow
their inexhaustible energy to be imprisoned, controlled and set
free in strictly measured and required quantities'. In other
words, he looked upon Nehru as the instrument through which
the _Congress_ leadership could direct the patriotism and self-sacrificing
spirit of the youth of the country into 'proper channels'.
This had worked in 1930--32, Gandhiji reasoned --- it may
work in the new period as well.

His strategy, therefore, was to strengthen the forces of the
right inside the _Congress_ on the one hand and to allow the
leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru on the other, while he himself
remained in the background offering advice and influencing the
policies of both the right and the left. This, in essence, was the
meaning of his retirement from active _Congress_ leadership.


[^8/1]: Meerut Conspiracy Case was a case initiated in British India in 1929 & decided in 1933. Indian (British subjects) & British nationals conspired to deprive King Emperor of the sovereignty of British India at the behest of Communist International. Several trade unionists, including three Englishmen, were arrested for organizing an Indian railway strike. The British government convicted 27 leftist trade union leaders under a lawsuit. Many covictions were overturned on Appeal.
