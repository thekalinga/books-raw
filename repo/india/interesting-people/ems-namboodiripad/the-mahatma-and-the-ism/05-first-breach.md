# First Breach

A large number of gandhiji's lieutenants and colleagues did
not see why he should be so perturbed at certain incidents that
had taken place in the course of the _non-cooperation_ movement.
Their reaction to Gandhiji's decision to suspend the movement
is described by Tendulkar :

> The sudden stoppage of the movement came as a shock. The
Bardoli decision created consternation among the _Congress_ leaders,
most of whom were in prison and left the rank and file angry.
Gandhi was attacked from all sides. Motilal Nehru, Lajpat Rai and
others sent from prison angry letters to Gandhi protesting against
his position. Why should, asked Motilal Nehru, a town at the foot
of the Himalayas be penalised, if a village at Cape Comorin failed
to observe _non-violence_? Isolate _Chauri Chaura_ and Gorakhpur, go
on with _civil disobedience_, individual and mass (II, p. 117).

This was the first breach in the unity that Gandhiji had been
able to forge in the ranks of the _Congress_ since the days of the
anti-Rowlatt Bill and _Khilafat_ agitation. Non-violent _non-cooperation_
was the programme through which he had been able
to rally the 'moderates' as well as the 'extremists' : his insistence
on _non-violence_ satisfied the 'moderates', while his call for antiimperialist
mass action roused the 'extremists'. However, the
horror with which Gandhiji looked upon the militant actions of
the masses, the haste in which he decided to suspend _civil disobedience_,
brought to the forefront all those basic questions
around which the _Congress_ ranks had earlier been divided.

What was to be the path of struggle for the realisation of
the national demand? Was it to be peaceful negotiations with
the British, or militant struggle against them? Was it to be a
path of rallying the mass of our people in determined actions
against the regime or a path of reliance on the constitutional
machinery to secure more and more reforms? These questions
which had once divided the 'moderates' from the 'extremists' once
again came to the forefront, but in another form.

Motilal Nehru, Lajpat Rai and others who protested against
Gandhiji's action in suspending the _civil disobedience_ movement
were by no means militant anti-imperialists. Some of them
(like Motilal Nehru) had actually been in the camp of the
'moderates' even in the earlier period. They had come to accept
the leadership of Gandhiji because they realised that his method
of rallying the masses against British imperialism would put a
good deal of pressure on imperialism. They hoped that this
pressure would force imperialism to negotiate with the _Congress_
and that, by skilful utilisation of mass actions unleashed under
Gandhiji's leadership, they could secure more and more constitutional
reforms. They were, therefore, not worried over some
'mob violence' here or there; these would undoubtedly take
place for which the _Congress_ would and should abjure all responsibility.
They did not share. Gandhiji's pessimism that this
would take the movement beyond the limits considered safe by
their own class. Hence their anger when they heard of
Gandhiji's decision.

But now that the suspension of the _civil disobedience_ had
become an accomplished fact, they raised the inevitable quesition:
what next? They had no patience with those who argued
that the masses would slowly imbibe the ideas of _non-violence_,
thus making it possible for the _Congress_ to make adequate preparations
for the launching of that type of non-violent struggle
which was visualised by Gandhiji. Looking upon Gandhiji's
technique of non-violent _non-cooperation_ from the purely practical
point of view of successfully forcing the British to negotiate
with the _Congress_, they came to the conclusion that, if
the suspension of the _civil disobedience_ movement was to be
endorsed, then the _Congress_ should look for new tactics.

It was in this search for new tactics that they came to the
conclusion that the newly-formed legislative councils should
be used, rather than boycotted. They argued that, while boycott
of legislatures was correct so long as it was inseparable part of
the programme of non-violent _non-cooperation_ leading to countrywide
_civil disobedience_, it had no meaning at a time when
_civil disobedience_ was not thought of. Not only did they openly
express these views, but they went to the extent of forming a
new party pledged to carry out this programme --- the Swaraj
Party. This was, of course, confined to a minority of _Congressmen_:
the Gaya session of the _Congress_ held in 1922 rejected
the programme of _council entry_ by 1740 votes against 890.

This was an indication of the dominant militant mood of
the mass of _Congressmen_. However, though a minority, the
_Swarajists_ were enormously influential inside the _Congress_;
firstly, because they were headed by some of the most wellknown
top leaders of the _Congress_; and secondly, because the
opponents of _council entry_ had no alternate programme of action.

The struggle between the _Swarajists_ and the "_no-changers_"
had started and developed while Gandhiji was in jail. (Ironically
enough, a few days after the suspension of the _civil disobedience_
movement, Gandhiji was arrested and put in jail.)
By the time of his release, therefore, the _Congress_ had already
been divided into two camps --- it was almost on the point of
being split into two organisations. Gandhiji, therefore, applied
himself to the problem of healing the breach and uniting the two
wings of the _Congress_. He sensed the atmosphere and found
that _council entry_ had become a settled fact. He knew that a
question on which such sharp difference existed in the leadership
of the _Congress_ could not be settled by a majority vote. He
posed the question thus :

> The question is, what is to be done regarding the _council entry_
as a settled fact? Are the non-cooperators to keep up their hostility
against the _Swarajist_ methods, or are they to remain neutral and
even help wherever it is possible or consistent with their principles?
... If the work of the _Swarajists_ prospers and the country benefits,
such an ocular demonstration cannot but convince honest sceptics
like me of our error, and I know the _Swarajists_ to be patriotic
enough to retrace their steps when experience has disillusioned
them. I would, therefore, be no party to putting any obstacles in
their way or to carrying on any propaganda against the _Swarajists'_
entry into the legislatures, though I cannot actively help them in a
project in which I do not believe (II, p. 172).

This was the way in which Gandhiji gave his blessings 'to
the _Swarajists_. It was certainly not in conformity with the
desires of his 'no-changer' lieutenants, such as Rajagopalachari,
Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad, etc. He had to, therefore,
patiently argue with them that the superiority of their 'no-change'
tactics was to be proved not by continuous opposition
to the _Swarajist_ programme, but by continuous and systematic
work outside the legislature. After all, he told them, the _Swarajist_'s
preoccupation with council work was not going to yield
much success in the struggle. for freedom; success could be
achieved only through hard work among the masses, work
towards preparing the country for the struggle that was undoubtedly
ahead. He advised them to concentrate on organising
the people, the only basis on which the national cause could
advance.

It was through such skilful yet persuasive arguments that
Gandhiji was able, in the end, to persuade the _Congress_, not
only to recognise the _Swarajist Party_ as an integral part of the
_Congress_, but to make it the centre of its political activity. At
the same time, he made it obligatory for the _Swarajists_ to engage
themselves in such activities as the promotion of _khadi_, eradication
of untouchability, propagation of Hindi, etc.

> And I have come to the conclusion that it is in the interest
of the country to give the _Swaraj Party_ the fullest possible chance
of working out its own programme without let or hindrance from
_no-changers_. The latter are not bound to participate in its activity
if they do not like it. They are free and bound, as the _Swarajists_
are bound, to pursue the _constructive programme_ only. They are
free also to retain their individual _non-cooperation_. But suspension
by the _Congress_ means that non-cooperators can derive no
support or strength from the _Congress_. They must derive all their
strength from within. And that is their test and trial (II, p. 22).

The next few years, therefore, were years in which Gandhiji
and his no-changer followers concentrated on the advancement
of the _constructive programme_. It was in pursuance of this
programme that Gandhiji organised the _All-India Khadi Board_.
It was to popularise this programme that he toured extensively
throughout the country. Wherever he went, he popularised the
programme of _khadi_ (homespun cotton cloth of India), argued against the untouchability, and
championed the programme of a _lingua franca_, etc.

The manner in which he went about from place to place,
popularising the cause of the _constructive programme_, has
several features which enabled him to mobilise the masses, but
prevent them from taking militant anti-imperialist political
action.

The most notable feature among these is that rarely did
Gandhiji refer to political questions. Take his speeches of
1921--22 where he often referred to the Punjab atrocities, the
_Rowlatt Bills_ and the _Khilafat_ movement --- all directed against
the British government. Contrast them to his speeches of 1924--28,
when almost all the speeches were concerned with social
and spiritual questions. He was rousing the people, not against
the political and economic system under which they were living,
but against certain social evils and for certain spiritual
values.

_Secondly_, though he did not rouse the people against imperialism,
landlordism and other forms of oppression and
exploitation, he spoke of the miseries of the people, the inequality
that existed in the country, the necessity of redressing
the grievances of the people. There was not one section of the
people whose problems he did not study, whose miserable conditions
he did not bring out, for whose comfort and solace he
did not plead with his audience. It was this that enabled him
to attract the various sections of the poor and downtrodden
masses.

Look, for example, how he talked with the _devadasis_.
'Supposing', he asked them, 'I took you away and gave you
sufficient food, clothing, education and clean surroundings,
would you leave this life of shame and come with me?' The
reply was 'Yes'. He referred to it in his speech, and poured out
his heart:

>As I was talking to them and understanding the hidden meaning
of the thing, my whole soul rose in rebellion against the custom
of taking minor girls for immoral purposes. Calling them _devadasis_,
we insult God Himself in the name of religion. ... (II, p. 371).

Look again how he replies to the taxpayers of Bangalore
who wanted to hear him on municipal problems:

>I am glad that you have introduced here compulsory primary
education. I congratulate you on your spacious roads, your splendid
lighting and your beautiful parks. But while I can infer from your
address that the middle and the upper classes must be happy here,
I wonder if you have a poor class at all, and if you have, what you
are doing to keep them clean and healthy. Have you shared in their
hardships and their sorrows? Have you ever thought of the conditions
in which the sweepers and the scavengers live? Have you ensured
a cheap milk supply for the infants, the aged and the infirm
of the poorer classes? Are you sure that the foodstuffs that your
provision dealers sell are clean and unadulterated?. ... I can ask you
many more questions. If you have a satisfactory reply to each of
them, I can congratulate you. But if you have none, then I beseech
you to give them your most earnest consideration (II, pp. 363--64).

_Thirdly_, though speaking in the name of, and in a language
understandable to, the masses of the toiling people, Gandhiji
was firmly opposed to anything that would rally the masses
against the existing social system. His reply to Saklatwala[^5/1], who
visited India in 1927 and had a long interview with him, is
characteristic. He concedes that 'Comrade Saklatwala is dreadfully
in earnest. His sincerity is transparent. His passion for
the poor is unquestioned'. But, says Gandhiji, 'Comrade Saklatwala
disdains to study facts', 'ignores India and Indian
conditions'.

And what are these facts' and 'conditions' which Comrade
Saklatwala ignored?

>I do not regard capital to be the enemy of labour. I hold their
coordination to be perfectly possible. The organisation of labour
that I undertook in South Africa, Champaran or Ahmedabad was in
no spirit of hostility to the capitalists. The resistance in each case,
and to the extent it was thought necessary, was wholly successful.
My ideal is equal distribution, but so far as I can see, it is not to be
realised. I, therefore, work for equitable distribution. This I seek
to attain through _khaddar_. And since its attainment must sterilise
British exploitation at its centre, it is calculated to purify the British
connection. Hence, in this sense, _khaddar_ leads to _swaraj_ (II,
p. 340).

In other words, the _khadi_ programme was a programme of
organising labour-capital coordination and the 'purification' of
the British connection.

_Fourthly_, the _constructive programme_ was a programme of
action --- action in the sense that everybody who swore by it had
to _do_ something. It was one of the greatnesses of Gandhiji that
he mastered the art of giving some job to everybody who went
to him. You may be a worker or a peasant or a professional;
whatever you may be, Gandhiji had something which kept you
busy. And in thus keeping you busy, he gave you the exhilarating
idea that you were serving the great cause of the spiritual,
economic and political regeneration of your country. It was this
that he accomplished through his message of _charkha_[^5/2], the
message of other cottage industries, the message of Hindi, the
message of the uplift of the untouchables, the message of social
reform in general.

Gandhiji roused you to activity on all these issues and created
in you the sense of doing all these things as the necessary
preparation for the struggle for _swaraj_. Behind all the separate
items of the _constructive programme_ was the message of resistance
to imperialism. It was through this that Gandhiji could
create hundreds of determined cadres for the national movement
under his leadership, who were fired with the spirit of service
and sacrifice, but were the least 'tainted' with the 'sin' of that
revolutionary fervour which may endanger the very existence
of the class which Gandhiji represented.

_Fifthly_, the most remarkable feature of Gandhiji's activities
in those years was the skilful way in which he integrated the
ostensibly non-political _constructive programme_ with the avoiedly
political activities of the _Swarajists_. While allowing the
_Swarajists_ to have the satisfaction that it is they who were carrying
on 'real' political work, i.e., the work of exposing and fighting
the government with all the available means and weapons of
struggle; while equally allowing the _constructive workers_ to have
the satisfaction that it is they who were preparing the country
for the inevitable future struggle against imperialism; Gandhiji
was able to hold the reins of both the _Swarajist_ and constructive
wings of the _Congress_ and thus unify the leadership and ranks
of the _Congress_ under him.

Blessing the _Swarajists_, he laid down the line which they
should pursue inside the legislatures --- the line of 'endeavour
ing to give strength to the _constructive programme_ of the _Congress_'.
He asked them not to follow

>a general policy of obstruction ... but to move resolutions requiring
the central and provincial governments, as the case may be, first,
to make all their cloth purchases in hand-woven and hand-spun
_khaddar_; secondly, to impose a prohibitive duty on foreign cloth; ...
If the government refuses to enforce such a resolution when carried
in the legislature, I should notify them to dissolve them and take
the vote of the electors on the specific points. If the government
would not dissolve, I should resign my seat and prepare the country
for _civil disobedience_ (II, pp. 172--73).

While claiming that he himself was a _constructive worker_
rather than a _Swarajist_, he took keen interest in all the activities
of the _Swarajists_. He gave his blessings to the well-known
tactics adopted by the _Swarajists_ and their allies in the central
legislature --- the moving of the famous resolution on national
demand and the pursuing of the tactics of obstruction and _walkout_
when it was not accepted. He gave the enormous weight
and authority of his name in favour of whatever efforts were
made by the _Swarajists_ to open negotiations with the British
rulers, but kept himself in the background till these negotiations
reached a stage in which he felt that there was a certain amount
of possibility of success.

It is remarkable, in this connection, how he expressed himself
on the negotiations between _Deshbandhu Das_, the _Swarajist_
leader, and Lord Birkenhead, the secretary of state for India.
In the course of a speech in Calcutta on 1 May 1925 he said that,
instead of entering into diplomatic relations with 'matchless
diplomats' from England he preferred to concentrate on the _constructive
programme_ for developing the power of India from
within. However, a few days later, on 20th June, he himself
made a public appeal to Englishmen to respond to the offer
made by the _Deshbandhu_:

>The Faridpur speech, had a great purpose behind it. It was a
generous response to the Anglo-Indian friends who were anxious
for the great patriot to make his position clear and make the first
approach. He made it. The cruel hand of death has removed the
author of the gesture from our midst. But I would like to assure
Englishmen who may be still doubtful about the sincerity of _Deshbandhu_'s
motive that throughout my stay in Darjeeling, the one
thing that struck me most was his utter sincerity about that utterance.
Cannot this gloroius death be utilised to heal the wounds and
forget distrust? (II, p. 255).

In short, the technique that he slowly evolved in the postnon-cooperation
days was one of allowing the _Swarajists_ to take
advantage of every opportunity to put forward the demand for
_swaraj_ and to open negotiations with the British government,
while, at the same time, utilising the energies of tens of thousands
of selfless _constructive workers_ to build up a network of
organisations and thus preparing the country for another round
of non-violent struggle, if the negotiations were to end in failure.

Not only was this eminently suited to the political requirements
of the _bourgeoisie_, but it was a policy which could be
successfully carried out by Gandhiji, who combined in himself
the direct leadership of the _constructive programme_ and the
indirect leadership of the _Swarajists_ in the matter of negotiations.
It was his ability to meet these requirements of the _bourgeoisie_
that made him the undisputed leader not only of the
_constructive workers_, but also of the _Swarajists_; not only of _Congressmen_,
but also of liberals and other _bourgeois_ parties and
groups.
