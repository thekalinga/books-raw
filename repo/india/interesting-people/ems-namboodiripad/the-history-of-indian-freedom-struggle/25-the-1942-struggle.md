# THE 1942 STRUGGLE

## THE _CRIPPS MISSION_

The fact that the Soviet Union and Britain were fighting
together on one side in the war did not bring out any change
in the British attitude towards India. As ever before, the
British rulers were adamant in their stand of not conceding
India's demand.

In this context, Prime Minister Churchill's speech in
the British parliament in September 1941 needs special mention
here. Earlier, the United States and Britain had jointly
published a document, called the _Atlantic Charter_. It envisaged
freedom for all peoples of the world to choose their own
mode of governance and for those who had lost sovereignty
to restore it. But Churchill stated that the _Atlantic Charter_
would not apply to India. What emboldened him to take
such a stand was his belief that there were serious differences
of opinion among the different groups within the Congress
as well as between the Congress and other political organizations
in India. And this belief was not altogether baseless.
For instance, it was well known that there were differences
between the Congress and the colleagues of Subhas Bose and
between these two on the one hand and the Communist and
Socialist parties on the other. Further, there were differences
within the _Communist Party_ on the change that the nature
of the war had undergone and within the Congress on the
evaluation of the development that took place following the
_individual satyagraha_ movement. Added to these were the
differences that existed between the Congress and the
_Muslim League_ and between them on the one hand and the
liberal leaders on the other. The British government decided
to cleverly utilize these differences.

The differences of opinion that existed among the Congress
leaders need special mention. As we have seen earlier,
twice after the outbreak of the war the Congress had taken
certain steps which were at variance with those taken by
Gandhi. What created this gulf between Gandhi and the
Congress leaders was the differences in the outlook of
Gandhi who was holding fast the "means of unadulterated
_non-violence_" and those of the "practical politicians" like
Nehru, Rajagopalachari, Patel and others in the Congress.

The Congress decided to launch _individual satyagraha_
and to assign its leadership to Gandhi only because Britain
refused to concede the demands raised by it even after a
majority of the leaders adopted an attitude of willingness to
cooperate with the British in their war efforts despite Gandhi's
opposition.

The first year of _individual satyagraha_ was coming to a
close. Rajagopalachari and some other leaders demand a
review of the year's experience. Although about 2,000
_satyagrahis_ were arrested, the movement did not yield any
significant result. Moreover, opportunities were coming forth
for fresh negotiations with the British rulers in the new situation
created by the entry of the Soviet Union in the war.
Accordingly, on the initiative of Rajagopalachari, the
_Congress Working Committee_ 'adopted' a resolution during the
Christmas of 1941 expressing readiness to cooperate with the
British in its war efforts.

Certain helpful moves came from the British also. Thus,
many top ranking Congress leaders including Nehru were
released from prison. The situation of war once again changed
basically with the Japanese attack on the United States
Pearl Harbour in December 1941.

Although the United States had taken an attitude
openly in favour of Britain and France, it was not a participant
in the war till December 1941. With the American entry
in the war, the war now became one with the governments
of the US, Britain and the Soviet Union along with the
liberation movements of the German occupied countries in
Europe on the one side fighting against the German and
Italian fascism and the Japanese militarism.

The surrender of France to Hitler, Japan's occupation of
Indo-China 4s a gift from France and the occupation of
other Asian countries following the declaration of war in
December 1941 would have made it easy for Japan to enter
India. It was the interest of the United States also to create
a political situation that would prevent such an eventuality.
It occurred to the American rulers that the Churchill government's
attitude towards India might turn out to be dangerous
to the Allies, including America. They made this known to
the rulers of Britain. They impressed upon the British that
it was in the interest of the Allies to liberate those Asian
countries which had fallen to Japan and also to prevent
India from falling to it. By this, they were, in fact, trying
to, replace the crumbling _Dutch-French-English_ imperialism
by their own imperialist domination in a new form.

But whatever their intention, the US move helped the
_bourgeois_ Congress leadership. America's generous political
support, the publicity received through the American newspapers,
the powerful anti-imperialist stand taken by the Soviet
Union, and the sympathies of the neighbouring countries, like
China were all considered as valuable assets by the Congress
leaders.

It was in this situation that the Chinese President
Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang visited India. China
was then fighting Japan. Because of their political weakness,
they could not exert much pressure either on Britain or on
the Indian government. But their visit with an open expression
of sympathy to India's national demand gave a boost
to the Congress policy of bargain.

This could not but leave an impact on the British rulers.
They were disturbed and anxious over the fate of India
following the Japanese occupation of Singapore. This also
reinforced the pressure being exerted by President Roosevelt
on the British Prime Minister Churchill. All in all, Britain
was forced to take some action to change the Indian public
opinion. It was in this background that the British government
sent to India Sir stafford Cripps, a member of the Wartime
Cabinet and a sympathizer to the Indian national movement.
The announcement in this regard created the impression
that the British authorities were trying to renounce their
hardline attitude towards India and to satisfy the Congress
and other political parties in India. Such was the publicity
the _Cripps mission_ received in the Indian and foreign press.

Even before Cripps set off to India, a draft declaration
had been prepared by the British government on India's
future constitutional set-up and on the changes that were to
be introduced in the existing system during the wartime.
This draft document was kept a secret until Cripps reached
India and held talks with the leaders of the different political
parties. On behalf of the British government, Cripps
claimed that he was trying to bring a settlement between
the government and the representatives of the Indian people.

The declaration had been prepared in such a way as to
make it appear progressive as compared to all the earlier
declarations made by the government. It had been stated
that the government would take steps to create "a nww
Indian Union which will have the full status of a Dominion."
The objective was stated to be to enable India to achieve the
"earliest possible realisation of _self-government_". The
declaration specifically stated that in order to realize the
objective, a constitution-making body would be set up
"immediately upon the cessation of hostilities".

Considering the policy declarations that the Congress
had hitherto been making, this draft declaration should
have been acceptable to it. But there were two important
conditions included in the draft declaration. One of the conditions
was that if one or more provinces were not prepared
to join the Indian Union, such province or provinces would
be free to frame a separate constitution and would have the
same status as the Indian Union. The rulers of the _Princely
States_ also would have the same right. The second condition
was concerned with the minorities. The new constitution
of the Indian Union and other provinces and states staying
out of it would guarantee the assurances given earlier by the
government to the Muslims, Christians, _Parsis_, Europeans,
Anglo-Indian and other communities.

All these were relating to the constitution. Equally
important were the problem of what was going to be done
immediately. The British government desired and urged
the effective participation of the different sections (parties
and organizations) representing the interests of the Indian
people in the functions of the governments of their own
country, the British Commonwealth and the United Nations.
Cripps claimed that what was being visualized was an Indian
national government with _Dominion Status_ at least nominally.

The _Cripps mission_ was a big gain to the _Muslim
League_, for most of the demands raised by the leaders of
the _League_ with regard to Pakistan had been accepted. Not
only that all the guarantees given to the religious minorities
had been honoured, the Muslim majority provinces were now
given the freedom to stay away from the Indian Union and
to form a separate nation by themselves. Furthermore, if
the _League_ would have a share in the Central government
which was going to be formed in accordance with the Cripps
proposals, it could strengthen itself utilizing the new position
in the government.

As for the Congress, the proposals seemed attractive in
the beginning, but as discussions progressed it realized
the underlying dangers. The provision contained in the proposal
giving the right to the provinces and the _Princely States_
to stay way form the Indian Union disturbed them. But
Rajagopalachari, Nehru, Patel and certain others were ready
to accept the Cripps proposal even ignoring Gandhi's opposition
to it. (This was exactly what happened after the termination
of the war.) What was really unacceptable to them was the
proposal relating to the change to be introduced immediately
in the Central government. Had the authorities been prepared
to constitute immediately a national government at the
Centre with the status of Dominion along with the provision
giving the right to the provinces to stay away from the Indian
Union, the Cripps proposal would have been accepted _in toto_
by all the Congress leaders except Gandhi.

The talks that took place at the different levels --- between
tha Congress leaders and Cripps, among Cripps, the Viceroy
and the Commander-in-Chief, among President Roosevelt's
personal representative and the Indian and British leaders
 --- revealed, what exactly were the differences between the British
government and the Congress. The latter insisted on its
demand that the Viceroy's Executive Council should right
now start functioning as the national government with
the status of a Dominion. But the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief
would not budge an inch insofar as sharing
their authority with others. Although Cripps and the US
representative tried their best to make them accept the position,
the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, who had the
support of Churchill, were adamant.

Thus failed the efforts to enlist the support of the Indian
people to the war against the fascist forces with the cooperation
of India's popular leaders. Cripps returned to England
empty-handed.

## '_QUIT INDIA_'

Even while Cripps' talks with Indian leaders were on,
the situation in India's eastern borders was causing alarm
to the _Allied Powers_ and to the people. The Japanese forces
were steadily advancing along the India-Burma road, conquering
on their way the British possessions of Singapore,
Burma,Malaya and the Andaman islands. There were Japanese
naval attacks in the Bay of Bengal. The eastern port cities
of Vishakhapatnam and Kakinada came under Japanese
bombardment. The government themselves had ordered
destruction of certain establishments in Madras fearing
Japan's invasion. In brief, there was an increasing probability
of India coming under the attack of Japan, like other Asian
countries.

The Congress maintained that in order to be able to
meet this threat a mere declaration about India's future was
not enough and demanded transfer of power, in whatever
form, including that of the defence department to the
representatives of the Indian people. The British rulers, on
the other hand, held adamantly that they would not part
with the control of such crucial departments, as defence
and home. Consequently, the Delhi talks broke off which,
in turn, caused great resentment and anger among the people.
There was practically no one in India who was not infuriated
by the stand taken by the British rulers, who were leading
an army which were fleeing on the face of the Japanese
attacks, that they would not hand over the country to her
own people, no matter even if they had to surrender it to
Japan.

It may be recalled that it was also the time when one
of the topmost national leaders, Subhas Bose, who had left
India, had been raising the _Indian National Army_ (_INA_) with
Indians in the territories held by Japan to liberate India with
the assistance of Japan. The contempt towards the British
army which were facing defeat after defeat together with
the impression created in India that the _INA_ led by Subhas
Bose were planning to launch an offensive against the British
rule in India aroused national sentiments among the people.
It seemed to them that the opportunity was at hand to liberate
themselves from the British rule.

These sentiments were, in fact, contrary to the policies
the Congress and other _anti-imperialist_ organizations had
been pursuing. They had been ceaselessly speaking to the
Indian people for about a decade against the fascist forces
of Italy and Germany and Japanese militarism. They had
been maintaining all along that an advance of the fascist
and the militarist forces would not set free the dependent
countries; it would lead only independent countries to lose
their freedom. They never entertained the illusion that India
could be liberated with the assistance of Japan. On the
contrary, they knew that a victory of Japan meant changing
from one master to another. That was why they demanded
that the British should transfer power to the Indian people
and resist Japan with their support.

But the experience of the leaders who expressed
readiness to lead the Indian people to fight Japan even at
the cost of the creed of Gandhian _non-violence_ posed the
question before all the political parties, excepting Bose and
his colleagues: What is to be done next? Different Congress
leaders answered this question differently.

Gandhi had left Delhi right in midst of the discussion
with Cripps. The proposals put forward by Cripps did not
at all seem to him attractive. Referring to Britain's defeat
in Malaya and Burma and their indifference in enlisting the
support of the people which was an essential condition for
avoiding the repetition of the defeat in India, Gandhi described
the Cripps proposal as a "postdated cheque on a
crashing bank". He regarded it an urgent task to take a
strong action against the British rulers who were adamantly
refusing to hand over India to her people. Accordingly,
Gandhi drafted a resolution and sent it to the _Working
Committee_ which was to be met towards the end of April.
He expressed the opinion that though the victory of the
_Axis Powers_ in the war appeared certain, Japan would leave
India alone. In case an invasion took place, he expected
"the people to offer complete _non-violent_ _non-cooperation_
to the invading forces and not to render any assistance to
them."

Many members of the _Working Committee_, including
Nehru and Azad, were not in agreement with Gandhi's ideas.
They considered the idea of ejecting the British with the
assistance of Japan absurd and thought it's possible to get the
adamant attitude of the British relaxed with the assistance
of the world leaders like President Roosevelt. Since an _anti-fascist_
front including China, the Soviet Union and the
United States which were sympathetic to India had now been
formed. Later, a resolution to this effect was adopted by the
_AICC_ replacing the draft resolution submitted by Gandhi.

However, this hope was soon shattered. It became clear
that neither Roosevelt nor other world leaders could intervene
in the Indian affairs. Nor did they come forward to exert
pressure on the British, since they were convinced that a
transfer of the defence department to the Indians in the
midst of the war would adversely affect the efficient conduct
of the war. Hence, most leaders including Nehru and Azad
had to fall in line with Gandhi. How agonizing this change
was had been stated by Azad:

>I reached Wardha on 5 July and Gandhiji spoke to me
>for the first time about the '_Quit India_' Movement. I could
>not easily adjust my mind to this new idea ... I felt that
>we must refrain from any word or action which could
>offer encouragement to the Japanese. It seemed to me that
>the only thing we could do was to wait upon the course
>of events and watch how the war situation developed.
>Gandhiji did not agree. He insisted ... that the British must
>leave India. If the British agreed, we could then tell the
>Japanese that they should not advance any further. If in
>spite of this they advanced, it would be an attack on India
>and not on the British. If such a situation developed we
>must oppose Japan with all our might.
>
>I have already said that I had been in favour of organized
>opposition to the British at the outbreak of the war.
>Gandhiji had not then agreed with me. Now that he had
>changed, I found myself in a peculiar position. I could
>not believe that with enemy on the Indian frontier, the
>British would tolerate an organized movement of resistance.
>Gandhiji seemed to have a strange belief that they would.
>He held that the British would allow him to develop his
>movement in his own way. When I pressed him to tell us
>what exactly would be the programme of resistance, he
>had no clear idea. The only thing he mentioned during
>our discussions was that unlike previous occasions, this
>time the people would not court imprisonment voluntarily.
>They should resist arrest and submit to the government
>only if physically forced to do so. ...
>
>Gandhiji held that the British would regard his move for
>an organized mass movement as a warning' and not take
>any precipitate action. He would therefore have time to
>work out the details of the movement and develop its
>tempo according to his plans. I was convinced that this
>would not be the case. ...
>
>Gandhiji's idea seemed to be that since the war was on
>the Indian frontier, the British would come to terms with
>the Congress as soon as the movement was launched. Even
>if this did not take place, he believed that 'the British
>would hesitate to take any drastic steps with the Japanese
>knocking at India's doors. He thought that this would
>give the Congress the time and opportunity to organize an
>effective movement. My own reading was 'completely
>different. ...
>
>Our discussions started on 5 July and continued for several
>days... We began to discuss in greater detail the various
>elements of the proposed movement. Gandhiji made it
>clear that like other movements, this would also be on the
>basis of _non-violence_. All methods short of violence
>would however be permissible. During the discussions,
>Jawaharlal said that what Gandhiji had in view was in
>fact an open rebellion, even if the rebellion was _non-violent_.
>Gandhiji liked the phrase and spoke of an open
>_non-violent revolution_ several times.[^25/1]

This rather long passage is quoted here to show the
depth of the crisis of thinking that Congress was caught in
before the '_Quit India_' resolution was adopted. The strategy
of Nehru and Azad of bringing pressure on Britain with the
assistance of the US and China had failed. If, in place of
it, Gandhi's strategy was to be adopted, it would create an
atmosphere for the successful advance of the hated fascist
_Axis forces_. On one side, the adamant attitude of the British
and on the other, the popular urge to force the British to
_Quit India_ even with the assistance of the fascist _Axis forces_,
Bose and his colleagues in between the two trying to
enter India along with the Japanese army --- how to face all
these simultaneously? Finally, Nehru and Azad, surrendered
to Gandhi.

There was another prominent Congress leader, Rajagopalachari,
who, as indicated earlier, had deviated the
Gandhian path more than once and trodden his own. Once
again he came out with his own views and proposed that the
Congress should be courageous enough to concede the _Muslim
League_'s demand (for Pakistan) and revive the Congress ministries
in the provinces. Rajagopalachari got two resolutions
incorporating his proposals adopted by the Congress Legislature
Party of _Madras Presidency_. He also presented one of
these resolutions before the _AICC_, which was, however,
rejected with a large majority of votes. Not only that; the
_AICC_ adopted a counter-resolution declaring that:

>any proposal
to disintegrate India by giving liberty to any component
state or territorial unit to secede from Indian Union or
Federation, will be highly detrimental to the best interests
of the people of the different States and Provinces and the
country as a whole and the Congress, therefore, cannot
agree to any such proposal.

As soon as the result of the voting on the resolution
was made known, Rajagopalachari announced that he would
campaign for his views in his province (Madras). He resigned
from the primary membership of the Congress as well
as his membership in the _Madras Legislative Assembly_,
following the directive of the _Parliamentary Party_. (He had
already resigned from the _Working Committee_ earlier.)

Rajagopalachari's actions failed to create any impact
either in his province or in the Congress. Although he was
occupying a high position in the Congress, he was swimming
against the current of popular sentiments. The masses were
angry over the series of defeats being inflicted on Britain
and other _Allied Powers_ in Europe and over Britain's obstinacy
in holding on to power in India even in the humiliating
conditions created by these defeats. Bose and Gandhi were
giving shape to this popular anger in two distinct forms.
Although Nehru and Azad did not agree with their policies,
they had to take account of the popular sentiments and adopt
the '_Quit India_' resolution. They were constrained to
launch a mass struggle which might, perhaps, lead to the
victory of Japan and other fascist forces in the war --- a step
hard to digest for them from the very beginning.

The passage quoted from Azad makes it obvious that
however forcefully and determinedly Gandhi was talking
about the '_Quit India_' struggle, he was, in fact, gropping in
the darkness. For instance, he did not know where to stop
the struggle which he was going to launch. Although he was
talking enthusiastically about a mass struggle, he had made
no arrangement to carry it out in an organized way. He was
operating with a child-like confidence that enough time and
facilities would be available and that the rulers would not go
in heavily to suppress the struggle. It is doubtful if the world
has ever witnessed a mass revolution which has been led so
unplanned a way. This is the basic character of the "_Quit
India_" struggle which has been subsequently eulogized so
highly. A mass struggle of such a magnitude that has never
taken place in Gandhi's entire political life in a political background
deviod of a programme of struggle and of an organization
to carry it out --- this was '_Quit India_'.

This may sound strange. But there is nothing strange in
it, for the present struggle, like all the earlier ones, to be
launched by Gandhi was not designed to overthrow the British
rule relying on the revolutionary potentials of the people, but
to create a political atmosphere necessary for reaching a
compromise with the rulers. Gandhi had made it clear to
Nehru and Azad that he was contemplating to launch '_Quit
India_' struggle on the calculation that the rulers would be
compelled to seek a compromise not long after the launching
of the struggle.

## THE '_AUGUST REVOLUTION_'

On 14th July 1942 the _Congress Working Committee_ met
at Wardha and adopted a resolution which subsequently became
well known as the '_Quit India Resolution_'. The _Working
Committee_ also decided to convene a meeting of the _AICC_
at Bombay on 7th and 8th August to take a final decision on
the resolution.

Nehru and Azad had abandoned their stand and come
round to Gandhi's way of thinking even before the _Working
Committee_ met. This, however, does not mean that their
doubts about the desirability and consequences of the struggle
had been removed. Rather, they came round because there
was no alternative left before them on the face of the adamant
attitude of the British rulers and also the helplessness of the
world leaders. So, they simply cast aside all the doubts and
joined hands with Gandhi.

Interestingly, it was Nehru himself who presented the
_Quit India Resolution_ at the _AICC_ meeting. Again, it was
he who answered the Communists who introduced amendements
to the resolution. Gandhi was thus able to rally all
sections in the _AICC_ behind himself and get the resolution
passed almost unanimously (excepting opposition from
Communists).

The _AICC_ adopted the _Quit India Resolution_ on 8th
August and before dawn of the next day, all Congress leaders
who were present in Bombay was arrested and put behind
the bars. Simultaneously, _Congressmen_ at the different levels
were arrested similarly all over the country. It became evident
that the government had a well-designed plan to suppress the
_Quit India Struggle_ launched by the Congress without a plan.

There were indications to show which way the government
was moving. Immediately after the _Working Committee_
meeting, Gandhi made an attempt to open negotiation which
was 'part and parcel of his method of struggle'. He sent one
of his close disciples, Miss Slade alias Mira Ben to the Viceroy
to explain to him the resolution of the _Working Committee_
and the form of struggle envisaged therein. But the Viceroy
refused her permission to meet him making clear that "the
government would not tolerate any rebellion during the war,
whether it was _violent_ or _non-violent_", and that it was not prepared
to "meet or discuss with any representative of an organisation
which spoke in such terms".

Besides, on 17th July (three days after the meeting of
the _Working Committee_), Gandhi had obtained a copy of
the circular sent by the Secretary of the Publicity Department
of the Government of India to the provincial governments, to
which Gandhi had referred in his speech at the Bombay
_AICC_ meeting. Thus, the Congress had received the warning
that the government was getting ready to face the
struggle it was going to launch. Since the Publicity Department
had issued such a circular, it could well be imagined that other
departments also must have made similar arrangements to
face the situation. But as against it, there was absolutely no
preparedness on the part of the Congress. Gandhi never
bothered, either to save at least a section of the leadership
from mass arrests or to create an underground organization
functioning continuously in the background of such mass
arrests as any party in the world would do while organizing
mass revolts against the government. What is more, he even
made it clear in his speech before the Bombay _AICC_ that
he was opposed to any such venture and maintained that
since the struggle he was visualising was an "open mass
revolt", there was no room for underground activities and
so on, and those who indulged in secret activities would land
themselves in danger and so forth.

It may be argued that there was nothing, strange in it
since Gandhi was always opposed to secret activities. He had
always maintained that secret activities were negations of the
_satyagraha programme_ he had formulated. But as different
from the struggles conducted under his leadership earlier,
he now left the participants free without placing any restriction
on them. He was not bothered about "violent
tendencies" of which he was afraid in each struggle he undertook
to lead since 1921. Now his central slogan was "_do or
die_". Gandhi gave the direction that in case he and other
Congress leaders were arrested, _Congressmen_ at the different
levels and the people should take their own initiative to carry
on the struggle in whichever way they considered right.

This idea was, in fact contained in the _AICC_ resolution
which stated:

>A time may come when it may not be possible
to issue instructions of for instructions to reach our people
and when no Congress committee can function. When this
happens, every man, and, woman who is participating in this
movement must function for himself, or herself within the
four corners of the general instructions issued. Every, Indian
who desires freedom and strives for it must be his own guide
urging him on along the hard road where there is no resting
place, and which leads ultimately to the independence and
deliverance of India.[^25/2]

[^25/2]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _op. cit_, Vol II p. 346.

Gandhi had laid down the condition earlier that every
one who participated in the struggle should engage oneself in
the implementation of his _constructive programme_ of spinning
and weaving _Khadi_. He also used to avoid struggle
whenever there was a semblance of "violent tendency" and
called the struggle when there was a minor incident of
violence. None of these principles had been adhered to now.
He gave unconditional and unlimited freedom to everyone to
engage oneself in anti-government activities in whichever
way one considered appropriate. That was why Nehru told
that what had come form Gandhi now was a call for an "open
rebellion", a statement which Gandhi himself approved.

Nevertheless, the _Quit India Struggle_ contained most of
the features of the Gandhian method of struggle. As in the
case of the earlier struggles, in the present one also the
large-scale mobilization of the people was designed to solve
the problem through negotiations (bargaining) with the
authorities. That was why immediately after the meeting of
the _Working Committee_ which adopted the '_Quit India_'
resolution, Gandhi sent Mira Bed to get in touch with the
Viceroy. What is more, both the resolution of the _Working
Committee_ adopted on 14th July and the '_Quit India_' resolution
in August had left the door open for negotiations.

As we have seen, on many an occasion after the outbreak
of the war, Gandhi had differed from the majority of
the _Working Committee_ on the question of whether the Congress
should participate in Britain's war efforts --- actions
which are quite at variance with the Gandhian principle of
_non-violence_. On this issue also Gandhi had gone back from
his earlier position. For example, the _Working Committee_
resolution made it clear that the Congress was "agreeable to
the stationing of the armed forces of the Allies in India,
should they so desire, in order to ward off and resist Japanese
or other aggression, and to protect and help China" and that
the interim national government would have no objection in
participating in such activities, because the Congress was as
much interested as Britain and the _Allied Powers_ in driving
out the Japanese aggressors and rescuing China. It must be
specifically noted that reference to this was made by way of
explaining the background of launching the _Quit India Struggle_
in the resolution drafted with the approval of Gandhi.

The _Quit India Resolution_ was an appeal to the radical
sections in Britain as also to the _Allied Powers_ of the US,
Soviet Union and China. The line of argument was that the
Congress was launching upon the struggle reluctantly since
the British was not prepared to give up its adamant attitude
towards granting India its rights which would prepare the
ground for the Congress to mobilize the whole people of
India in the war in which these foreign friends were interested.
Clearly, this was an approach designed to prepare the
ground for negotiations.

The Congress approach was such that it was likely to
appear justifiable to any impartial observer in relation to the
relationship between the British rulers and their allies and
also between the Congress and other political parties and
organizations. Gandhi and Azad emphatically stated that the
Congress was not demanding the British to leave for the
sake of the Congress but for the whole country and that if
the British were making use of the claims made by the _Muslim
League_ as a trump, they would not mind even if power
was transferred to it. The resolution stated that what was
aimed at was "a provisional government formed by the
cooperation of the principal parties and groups in the country"
and the preparation of "a constitution for the governance
of India acceptable to all sections of the people".
Thus, the present struggle was also looked upon as a means
to win the demands through bargain.

But as distinct from the earlier struggles, what was
contemplated now was a massive struggle by releasing the
people to do what they liked. "Leave India in God's hands",
Gandhi told the British authorities, "in modern parlance, to
anarchy ...". The Congress leaders realized that nothing short
of a massive, unrestrained struggle which Gandhi did not
hesitate to call an "open rebellion", would create conditions
for effectively bargaining with the British.

The Congress leaders were aware of the fact that it
was dangerous to launch a struggle at a time when the war
had reached a critical juncture. And this was specifically
mentioned in the _AICC_ resolution. But they gave the call
for a struggle facing any possible eventuality that might
arise in the circumstances in which Britain had been facing
one defeat after another in the war. According to their calculation,
the popular support they might gain through such a
struggle would help them to bargain with the authorities at
least in the future. They felt that if they surrendered before
the adamant attitude of the rulers, they would lose whatever
popular support they had been able to gain through the struggles
for several decades.

The British rulers too, had realized their own weakness.
They knew that they would not be able to remain in India
for long even if they succeeded in suppressing the Congress
far the time being. A noting made by the then King of
England, George VI, in his dairy in July 1942 throws light on
this. Quoting Churchill's statement that his colleagues and
all parties in the British Parliament were ready to hand over
India to the Indians after the war, he wrote that things
appeared, as if Cripps, the newspapers and the American
public opinion together had impressed upon these parties
that the continuance of their rule in India was wrong. Thus,
neither the British rulers nor the Congress leaders had any
doubt that the British would have to leave India handing
over power to the Indians not long after the war. The former
maintained that their rule should continue without any
significant change during the war in order to prosecute the
war effectively, while the Congress held that in order to realize
the same objectives Indians themselves should wield power
in India. This was the difference between they two sides.
Each side began to operate on its own stand-point.

The _AICC_ session terminated at night on 8th August 1942 after adopting the _Quit India Resolution_. The slogans
like "_Freedom or Death_", and "_Do or Die_" reverberated
throughout the country. On the same night the government
struck hard at the Congress which crumbled as never before.
This was what the _Congressmen_ and Socialists praised as the
"_August revolution_". Was it really a revolution? Let us
examine.

There were protest demonstrations following the mass
arrests that took place throughout the country and there were
police _lathi-charges_ and firings at the demonstrators. In many
places where such actions took place, the people went into
counter-actions against the police and the military. These
were what was known as the "_August revolution_". _Congressmen_
and Socialists are in the habit of proclaiming proudly
that they were the organizers and participants of that "revolution".
They used to denounce the Communists for having
refused to participate in it and for opposing it.

But what actually took place during August and September 1942 was not a revolution as they are claiming; it was
only a demonstration of protest against the repression let
loose by the government. Neither Gandhi nor other Congress
leaders had ever tried to give an organized form to the _anti-imperialist_
feelings spontaneously displayed by the people.
On the other hand, the government had a pre-determined
plan to suppress the struggle within a matter of days.

Thus, the government was able to sweep at one stroke
and throw into prison the leaders who were repeating the
words "revolution" and "open rebellion" without doing
anything necessary to organize that "revolution". The
advocates of "_August revolution_" are, in fact, characterizing
this attack of the rulers on the Congress and the national
movement as revolutionary attack of the Indian people against
the British rulers!

## STAGES AND ORGANIZERS OF "_QUIT INDIA_'

The movement variously called the '_Quit India Struggle_'
and the '_August revolution_' began with the mass arrests
that took place before the dawn of 9th August. As we have
seen in the preceding section, neither Gandhi nor other
Congress leaders had any idea as to how to organize and
lead the struggle. In the words of Nehru:

>Neither in public
nor in private at the meetings of the _Congress Working
Committee_ did he (Gandhi) hint at the nature of action he
had in mind, except a one-day general strike. So neither
he nor the _Congress Working Committee_ issued any kind of
directions --- public or private --- except that people should be
prepared for all developments and should in any event
adhere to the policy of peaceful and _non-violent_ action.[^25/3]

[^25/3]: Quoted in R C. Majumdar, _History and Culture of the Indian People_,
Vol II, Bombay, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1969, p. 656.

But as distinct from earlier struggles in which severe restrictions
were imposed on the participants, the general instruction
given in the _AICC_ resolution and repeated by Gandhi in
his speeches and statements was that "every Indian who
desires freedom and strives for it must be his own guide" in
the fight against the British rule. People were given a free
hand in deciding the mode of the struggle and in forming
the fighting organizations. Gandhi and other leaders never
know and nor did they want to know how the people would
act and against whom they would turn in carrying out the
task set before them; they merely declared that what they
intended was an "open rebellion" that might follow the
release of the fighting spirit of the people.

It was in the background in which this idea had run
deep into the people that the mass arrests took place before
the dawn of 9th August in a manner that enraged the people.
And they expressed their protest against this action by holding
huge demonstrations.

It must be noted that the demonstrations held on 9th and
10th August were relatively peaceful. But when these
peaceful protest actions by the people were brutally attacked
by the government, the people came out to sabotage the
railway lines and the post and telegraph services in order to
prevent the movement of the police and military forces which
were being used to attack the people.

Viewed from the tradition of the Gandhian struggle,
this had created the situation which was sufficient for the
withdrawal of the struggle. However, neither Gandhi nor the
other leaders of the Congress deprecated these acts of violence.
On the contrary, they attributed the violence on the part
of the people to the use of force committed by the authorities
on peaceful and _non-violent_ demonstrators. From the prison
Gandhi had sent a letter to the Viceroy to this effect.

The government charged that the forms of struggle
adopted at the second stage, as distinct from those of the
days immediately following the mass arrests, were the result
of a planned programme, for which they put the blame on
Gandhi and other leaders. In support of this, the rulers
pointed out that the nature of the sabotage that took place
several places simultaneously was the same. They also pointed
out that these acts of sabotage were such that they could be
executed only by those who had the necessary expertise in
using specialized equipments.

But there was no evidence whatever to suggest that
Gandhi or any other member of the _Congress Working Committee_
had ever given any instruction for carrying out
sabotage. On the contrary, there was enough evidence to
show that they gave the call for this "mass rebellion" without
giving any clear instruction on the conduct of the struggle and
without creating an organization for that purpose. This, however,
does not mean that the Congress leaders were free from
the responsibilities for the forms of the struggle employed following
the incidents that took place on 9th August, including
the acts of sabotage. For they had openly given the general
direction to the people to express their discontent and anguish
towards the British rule by adopting any means which each one
of them considered appropriate. What happened throughout
the country after the mass arrests was that they carried out
this direction in its literal sense. The people considered it
their duty to paralyze the oppressive rule which unleashed
cruel repression on the peaceful protest demonstrations in
the initial stage of the struggle.

Among the people who were thus agitated, there were
also experts in technical matters. They dedicated their
expertise to the '_Quit India Struggle_' and trained others in
such acts as removing railway tracks, damaging bridges,
destroying government office buildings, post and telegraph
services, and so on. Thus, acts of sabotage of different kinds
and forms took place extensively as part of the expression
of their protest without any specific direction from above.

A certain development took place in the meantime which
gave these unorganized activities an organized character.
There were some leaders at the provincial level and below
who had escaped arrest on 9th August. They and certain
others like Jayaprakash Narayan who had escaped from
prison formed a secret organization of the Congress and
started sending circulars to the _Provincial Congress Committees_
as "_AICC_ directives". Similar secret organizations
came into being in many provinces. Illegal printing presses
and publications, short time radio broadcasting stations,
etc., also began to function. Collecting fire arms, teaching
and learning bomb-making, conducting sabotage making
use of explosives and such other activities started in an organized
manner. With all this, the "_Quit India Struggle_" acquired
an organized character with an underground leadership
centralized at least at the provincial and local levels.

As a result of these activities, the government machinery
became completely paralyzed at least in some areas and secret
mass movements which can rightly be called "parallel governments"
emerged. Such parallel governments were formed
and started functioning in Ballia in UP, Bhagalpur and
other places in Bihar, Midnapore in Bengal and Satara in
Maharashtra. Although these movements were Shattered
before long in the face of attacks by the authorities, they
constituted an important development that took place as part
of the "_Quit India_" struggle in the different parts of the
country.

Both the British rulers and the liberal politicians blamed
the top leadership of the Congress and Gandhi for this
situation. That this charge was unfounded is clear from the
unplanned character of the struggle visualized by the
Congress. For, the Congress leadership had never sent out
any directive with regard to the struggle. Besides, it would
be clear to anyone that if the Congress had really intended
to carry out such programmes as sabotage and setting up
parallel governments, they could have organized them in
much more wider a scale than what had happened in the
weeks following 9th August. The fact that these were confined
to a few places and lasted for a short duration makes
it evident that the organizers of these activities enjoyed much
less organized popular support than the central Congress
leadership.

However, it is significant to note that neither Gandhi
nor other Congress leaders came forward to deplore the
sabotage, parallel governments and other activities organized
in the name of the '_Quit India_' struggle. On the contrary,
they characterized the organizers of the struggle who adopted
the means which were contrary to the Gandhian _non-violence_
as patriots who carried out the call given by them.
Furthermore, they sought to justify the _Quit India Struggle_
which, in effect was violent, and to own it entirely to themselves
on the pretext that it was the British rulers who forced the
struggles to adopt the means unacceptable to them.

It still remains a riddle as to what Gandhi and other
Congress leaders would have done, had they not been arrested
en masse before the dawn of 9th August. Suppose that the
Congress leaders and the people in a certain place adopted
means of struggles deviating from the Gandhian creed of
_non-violence_ which was reiterated in the _Quit India Resolution_.
Would Gandhi have disowned such means of struggle?
If the answer is in the positive, would it not be a repudiation
of the _Quit India Resolution_ and the statements he had
made earlier? If the answer is in the negative, would it not
give room for the interpretation that he led a mass struggle
throwing overboard his own method of _non-violence_ for the
first time in his long life?

Fortunately for Gandhi and other Congress leaders,
there was no occasion for these questions to be raised. They
became free from the responsibility of deciding the form of
the struggle which they themselves called for. They could easily
maintain that the incidents of violence developed because
they were behind the bars. At the same time, since there
were leaders outside the jail who had the capacity as well as
the willingness to carry out the struggle in an organized
way, the programme of struggle which caused extreme difficulties
to the government were carried out under their leadership.
This provided opportunity to Gandhi and other
Congress leaders both to shrug off the responsibility for the
consequences of the actions organized by this group of leaders
and to own to themselves the gain of the "_August
revolution_ at the same time. As we shall see in the later
chapters, they did utilize this opportunity effectively during
the years 1945--46.

Prominent among those who organized the underground
activities and gave the _Quit India Struggle_ an organized character
after the first stage of the struggle were Jayaprakash
Narayan, Dr. Rammanohar Lohia and Mrs. Aruna Asaf Ali.
Although they functioned on behalf of the Congress, they
were Socialists. They declared that they stood for a people's
armed revolt, rather than adhering to the principle of _non-violence_
contained in the _Quit India Resolution_. They sharply
criticized the Congress leaders for giving a call for a countrywide
popular revolt without chalking out a programme of
struggle or creating an organization for that purpose. These
leaders who created the impression that they were effectively
carrying out the struggle through underground organizations,
were in a sense organizing the rank and file of the Congress
against the leadership.

This enhanced the popularity of the Socialists. People
felt that although Gandhi and the Congress leaders had
called for the struggle, it was the Socialists who were carrying
out the struggle in practice. Jayaprakash, Lohia and Mrs.
Asaf Ali came to be revered by the people.

However, this impression did not last long. The people
know that although it was the Socialists who created the
necessary organization for the struggle and gave leadership
to the struggle, the actual call for the struggle came from
Gandhi and other leaders of the Congress and that the former
only helped to carry out the call given by the latter. Their level
of consciousness was such that they thought that it was perhaps
a minor error on the part of the Congress leadership,
which, of course, could be corrected and that the leaders of the
struggle, at any rate, were the top Congress leaders including
Gandhi. In other words, the feeling they had towards Jayaprakash,
Lohia, Aruna and other leaders were secondary to
their reverence to Gandhi and other Congress leaders.
