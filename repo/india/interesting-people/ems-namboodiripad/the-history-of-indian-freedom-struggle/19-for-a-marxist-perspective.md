# FOR A MARXIST PERSPECTIVE

## EVALUATION OF _INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS_

The _Indian National Congress_ as an organization had a
not insignificant place in the emergent _anti-imperialist_ front
comprising the left-wing _Congressmen_ and the revolutionary
organizations including the _Communist Party_. But in evaluating
the exact place of the Congress, two distinct approaches
surfaced in the _anti-imperialist_ front. The _Communist Party_
was the most important organization which represented one
of these approaches, while the other approach was represented
by the _Congress Socialist Party_.

Each of these thinkings had its own part to play in
determining the direction of the _anti-imperialist_ movement
which had developed in strength both before and during the
Second World War. Even inside the _Communist Party_,
there were reflections of these two mutually conflicting
trends of opinion, and it was, in fact, the clash between these
two trends within the _Communist Party_ which led to the
split in the Party about three decades later.

It may be noted that in the early years of the _Communist
International_, there were similarly two approaches on the
question of building the working class revolutionary movement
in the colonial countries, including India. MN Roy
argued that since _Capitalism_ was developing in the colonial
countries and since the classes representing _Capitalism_ were
striving to further develop by bringing a rapprochement with
colonialism, the task of the Communists in the colonial
countries was to fight against the indigenous _bourgeoisie_.
Opposing Roy's arguments, Lenin asserted in the colonial
commission of the _Second Congress of the International_
that although _Capitalism_ was developing in the colonial
countries and the task of Communists in these countries
was to organize the working class on a revolutionary basis,
colonialism was a burden which had to be borne by all
sections of the people including the _bourgeoisie_. Therefore,
the working class as an independent political force
should organize the majority of the people, especially the
peasants, on a revolutionary basis and, at the same time,
make maximum use of the _anti-imperialist_ mentality being
expressed by the _bourgeoisie_.

The peasantry has a vital role to play in bringing this
Leninist tactics into practice. Looking from the class point
of view, the peasantry is a part of the _bourgeoisie_, although
they are subject to oppression and exploitation by _indigenous
feudalism_ and foreign imperialist domination. As the slogan
"_Land to the Tiller_" indicates, they desire to abolish the
feudal property rights on land (instrument of production) and
to establish the property rights of the peasantry. This desire
draws them to the struggle against _feudalism_ and imperialism.
Although this struggle is not for Socialism, alliance
with peasantry would help the working class to earn a powerful
ally in its fights against its class enemy. Therefore,
Communists in the colonial countries should take upon to
themselves the task of organizing the rural poor yearning to
own piece of land, under the leadership of the working class.

If the Communists were able to accomplish this task,
the working class would be able to rise as a class capable of
strengthening the _anti-imperialist_ movement making use of
the contradiction between the colonialists and the indigenous
_bourgeoisie_ and, at the same time, of exposing effectively and
opposing the wavering and treacheries of the _bourgeoisie_ in
the _anti-imperialist_ struggle. In other words, the working
class, standing independent of and working against the
_bourgeoisie_ must rise to the leadership of the poor including
the peasantry and join hands with the _bourgeoisie_ in the
fight against imperialist domination.

From the very outset, the Communists had been working
in accordance with these tactics. As part of this, they
had succeeded to a great extent in exposing the _bourgeois_
leaders, including Gandhi, and others holding social democratic
views.

However, the Communists committed certain grave errors
in the process of putting into practice this tactics which was
formulated by the _Communist International_ under the personal
leadership of Lenin. The organ of the International,
_Inprecor_, wrote in its issue of 3rd March 1935 that _Indian Communists_
committed a number of errors on the question of
participation in the _anti-imperialist_ struggle and that they
took a number of wrong actions. The article pointed out
that these were particularly manifest during the struggle of 1930 when new sections of the people were entering in it with
_petty bourgeois_ notions, with a tendency to blindly trusting
the _bourgeoisie_. In this situation, Communists should not
confine only to giving a call for an _anti-imperialist_ and _anti-feudal_
revolution. Rather, they should enter among the
masses waging the struggle and try to draw them to their
side. They should bring into practice the revolutionary tactics
of united front giving importance to the needs of the
_anti-imperialist_ struggle and to its concrete slogans. As a
result of the failure in this task, the struggle against national
_moderatism_ remained separated from the struggle against
imperialism and for the realization of the immediate demands
of the peasantry. Thus, the activities Communists should
have conducted among the workers who were coming under
the influence of national _moderatism_ were obstructed and
remained weakened. It also weakened the work they should
have undertaken inside the trade unions organized by the
'moderate' leadership. The inability to link the task of standing
in the forefront of the people engaged actively in the _anti-imperialist_
struggle with the struggle against national _moderatism_
facilitated the growth of sectarian views and tendencies
which were yet to be defeated.

What has been stated above relates to the views and
tendencies which had gained strength not only in the
_Communist Party of India_, but in the world Communist
movement as well. The _Seventh Congress of the Communist
International_ gave a powerful call for a struggle against these
views and tendencies. Georgi Dimitrov stated in his historic
report to the Seventh Congress of the International:

>Sectarianism finds expression _particularly_ in overestimating
the revolutionizing of the masses, in overestimating the
speed at which they are abandoning the positions of _reformism_,
in attempts to leap over difficult stages and overcomplicated
tasks of the movement. Methods of leading
the masses have in practice been frequently replaced by
the methods of leading a narrow party group. The power
of the traditional contacts between the masses and their
organizations and leaders has been underestimated, and
when the masses did not break off these contacts immediately,
the attitudes taken towards them was just as harsh
as that adopted towards their reactionary leaders. Tactics
and slogans have tended to become stereotyped for all
countries, and the special features of the specific conditions
in each individual country have been left out of account.
The necessity of stubborn struggle in the very midst of
the masses themselves to win their confidence has tended
to be ignored. ...

Although the _Salt Satyagraha_ and other struggles that
followed it were devised under the leadership of the _bourgeoisie_
with a feudal-medieval outlook, millions of people came
forward to participate in these struggles and challenge the
imperialist domination. The Communists in those days were
engaged themselves in merely exposing the policies and programmes
of the _bourgeois_ leaders including Gandhi without
participating in these struggles and sharing their bitter experience.
The result was that the _bourgeois_ leadership and the
people were getting closer to each other. The same _Inprecor_
article referred to above pointed out that unless strong actions
were taken to wipe out this sectarian disease, Communists
would not be able to strengthen their influence on the
people and to lead the workers, peasants and the urban poor
who were turning rapidly towards revolutionary attitude to
the path of the revolutionary organizations of a higher
form.

Rectifying this error, the Communists were formulating
in 1935 the policy of effectively participating in the _anti-imperialist_
struggles led by the Congress. However, with the
emergence of the _Congress Socialist Party_, a non-sectarian,
apparently anti-sectarian trend of thought developed in the
_anti-imperialist_ camp. The opinion that the Communists had
started rectifying the errors they had been committing hitherto
had begun to emerge in the leadership of the _Congress
Socialists_. To an extent, this created an atmosphere for
Communists and _Congress Socialists_ to work together. But,
in the midst of these joint activities also surfaced differences
in approach between them.

We have noted that it was the Communists who had
consistently and uncompromisingly opposed the policies of
the _bourgeois_ national leadership including Gandhi and exposed
their class character. The emergence of the _Congress
Socialist Party_ was an open recognition of the correctness of
these criticisms and exposures. Among the _Congressmen_
who effectively opposed the Gandhian leadership in the 1934
Bombay session of the Congress and in the _AICC_ meeting
that preceded it, the _Congress Socialist_ played a highly significant
role. In these meetings, Jayaprakash Narayan and
other _Congress Socialists_ strongly protested against both the
_bourgeois_ parliamentarianism and Gandhism. That was why
the Congress leadership looked upon the emergence of the
_Congress Socialist Party_ with suspicion and animosity.

As pointed out in the document of the _Communist
International_, a considerable section of the people who entered
the movement through the struggles of 1930s came with
_petty-bourgeois_ ideas and confidence in the _bourgeois_ leadership.
This was true of the _Congress Socialists_ also. In the
voice of protest they raised against _bourgeois_ parliamentarianism
and Gandhism also contained a tendency of compromise
with _bourgeois_ parliamentarianism and Gandhism as well as
confidence in the _bourgeois_ leadership. This was evident in
the records of the proceedings of the Bombay Conference
(October 1934) of the _Congress Socialist Party_ as well as in
the very condition set up by the Party that every _Congress
Socialist_ must be a Congressman.

The main document adopted by the Conference declared
that the aim of the _Congress Socialist Party_ was to get the
_Indian National Congress_ adopt Socialism as its objective and
to transform it into a Socialist organization. Basic to the declaration
of this objective was the hope that the Congress could
be converted into an organization fighting for Socialism, just
as the Congress had adopted the objective of _Full Independence_
in 1925 after changing the leadership earlier from Tilak
to Gandhi. Thus, they thought that with the strength of the
"_class struggle_" through trade unions, peasant unions and
other mass organizations, the Congress could be used as the
platform for the struggle for national independence. It was
a part of this strategy that the constitution of the Party
made membership in the Congress a condition for eligibility
of membership in the _Congress Socialist Party_.

It can be seen that this is totally devoid of any concept
of _class struggle_. For them _class struggle_ is an economic
struggle conducted through trade unions and other mass
organizations. Behind this lay hidden the thinking that class
relations have no relevance in the struggle for independence.
The _Congress Socialists_ refused to perceive the fact that the
_bourgeoisie_ and the working class were in conflict with each
other even in the _freedom struggle_, that the _bourgeois_ political
leadership exerted influence not only on the peasantry and
other sections of _petty bourgeois_ elements, but also on the
rear section of the working class and that the task of the
Communists and Socialists was to rally the masses in the _anti-imperialist_
revolutionary camp through struggles against the
influence of the _bourgeoisie_. They expected that the _Indian
National Congress_, the instrument of struggle of the _bourgeoisie_
and which emerged out the development of the _bourgeoisie_,
would turn itself into an instrument for Socialism.

The Communist could not but oppose these views.
Exposing the approach of the _Congress Socialists_ of transforming
the Congress into a Socialist organization, the Communists
said that the Congress was the political party of the
_bourgeoisie_, and it would be a self-deception and a betrayal
of the people to attempt to make it accept Socialism. They
further pointed out that the task of Communists and Socialists
was to effectively oppose the vacillations and deceptiveness
of the Congress by organizing the ranks as well as the _anti-imperialist_
elements in its leadership.

In other words, both the policy being pursued by the
Communists since 1930 of merely exposing orally the
_bourgeoisie_ without joining the struggles led by the _bourgeoisie_
and the policy of the _Congress Socialists_ working with
the illusion of turning the Congress into a Socialist organization
without perceiving the class character of that
organization had to be rectified. The concept of _anti-imperialist_
front was, in fact, a result of the process of this
rectification and the Lucknow session of the Congress held
in April 1936 was the culmination of this process.

## BACKGROUND OF THE LUCKNOW SESSION

Like the Lahore session held in 1929, the Lucknow
session of the Congress was a turning point in the history of
Indian Freedom movement. While the Lahore session adopted
the objective of _Full Independence_ under the pressure
of leftists inside and outside the Congress, the Lucknow
session adopted a clear _anti-imperialist_ programme to achieve
that objective. Significantly, Jawaharlal Nehru who was the
president of the Congress at the time of the Lahore session,
presided over the Lucknow session. Again, as in the case of
his Lahore presidential speech which gave expression to the
feelings of the supporters of _Full Independence_, the presidential
speech of Nehru at the Lucknow session gave expression
to the feelings of the _anti-imperialist_ revolutionaries,
including the Communists and _Congress Socialists_.

We have noted earlier that, although Nehru was elected
president of the Congress for the Lahore session and the
period following it, his leftist followers found no place in
the _Working Committee_. But as compared with the Lahore
session, the influence of the leftists was demonstrated more
strongly in the Lucknow session and this was reflected in the
composition of the _Working Committee_. Thus, out of 15
members elected to the Committee, only 10 belonged to the
right-wing. Of the remaining five, three were prominent
_Congress Socialists_, _viz._, Jayaprakash Narayan, Acharya
Narendra Dev and Achyut Patwardhan. In addition, Subhas
Bose who was in prison was also elected to the _Working
Committee_. These four and Jawaharlal Nehru had one way or
the other held leftist outlook. Thus, for the first time the voice
of the leftists began to be heard right inside the leadership
of the Congress.

Efforts have been made consciously by some to attribute
these political changes to Nehru's personality and to his
personal leadership. If one studies only his speeches and
articles, it is natural that one may get this impression. No
one can deny the personal contributions he has made for
the emergence and growth of the _anti-imperialist_ front. However,
it would be absurd to maintain that it was because of
his contribution alone that the front had emerged. The truth
is that even in his absence, the front had begun to emerge,
and that it had considerably helped for the development of
Nehru's personality.

We have made reference in some details tu the reorganization
of the _Communist Party_, the emergence of the
_Congress Socialist Party_ and their mutual criticisms with
regard to their policies and approaches to different political
issues. Here we shall mention specifically certain significant
changes that had come about in the policies of these parties
in 1935 as a result of these developments.

As we have noted in the previous section, the _Communist
Party_ had been in effect taking the sectarian attitude of
opposing the entire Congress without making a discrimination
between the _bourgeois_ leadership of the Congress and its
ranks. The _Communist Party_ decided to put an end to
this and to become the activists of the Congress in order to
draw the ranks of the Congress as well as the common people
behind it into the _anti-imperialist_ front.

Almost in the same period, the _Congress Socialist Party_
also made changes in its basic outlook and policies. The
Party gave up the objective of transforming the Congress into
Socialist organization and adopted the outlook of converting
it into an _anti-imperialist_ organization. The process of this
change in outlook started in the beginning of 1935 (about six
months after its first all-India conference) and ended with
its _Meerut conference_ in the beginning of 1936.

Even before the _Meerut conference_ of the _Congress Socialist
Party_, the relationship between the Socialists and
Communists had become one of cooperation which was
extended from the work of organizing the left inside the
Congress against its right-wing leadership to areas of workers,
peasants and students organizations. The political
rethinking that took place in the _Communist Party_ before and
after the _Seventh Congress of the Communist International_
helped this process. As a result of all this, the second all-India
conference of the _Congress Socialist Party_ adopted a
new "thesis" setting certain urgent tasks before the Party,
such as unification of all the _anti-imperialist_ forces, joining
hands with other leftist forces which stood in the forefront
of this work and strengthening the organization of workers,
peasants and other sections of the people. These programmes
represented the attempt being made to rectify the errors
contained in the programmes formulated in the Party's first
conference. In addition, the thesis also contained an outlook
based on Marxism-Leninism in place of the vague idea of
Socialism contained in the earlier programme.

However, many Socialist leaders like Jayaprakash Narayan
were inwardly in disagreement with the general perspective
and approach contained in the _Meerut Thesis_. This disagreement,
in fact, led later to intra-party struggles among
the _Congress Socialists_ on the one hand and to fierce conflicts
between the Party and the _Communist Party_. Nevertheless,
the _Meerut Thesis_ was a clear indication to the fact that the
_Congress Socialist_ leadership did recognize at least to an
extent the changes that were taking place in the international
and national politics. Besides, these developments prepared
the ground for cooperation between the _Congress Socialist
Party_ and the _Communist Party_ at least for the time being.
Immediately before and after the _Meerut conference_, the
General Secretary of the _Congress Socialist Party_, Jayaprakash
Narayan and the _Communist Party_ General Secretary,
PC Joshi, held talks with each other and arrived at an
understanding on the question of "transforming the Congress
into a national united front".

It must be noted that while these developments were
taking place, Nehru was either in prison or he was in Europe
in connection with the medical treatment of his ailing wife
Kamala Nehru, preventing him from taking part in active
politics. However, these developments did affect certain
changes in him. We have already referred earlier to the articles
he had written during the short period he was oụt of the
prison in 1933. Nehru said:

>I do believe that fundamentally
the choice before the world today is between some form
of Communism and some form of Fascism ... one has to
choose between the two, and I choose the Communist
ideal.[^19/1]

[^19/1]: Quoted in R. C. Majumdar (ed), _The History and Culture Indian People_,
Vol II, Bombay, _Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan_, 1969, p. 558.

Nehru expressed the same opinion in his presidential
address in the Lucknow session of the Congress. Earlier, he
formed his opinion on the basis of information collected
through newspapers and journals. But his stay in Europe in 1935 provided him opportunities to study these problems
rather closely. There he also got an opportunity to meet and
discuss with Ben Bradley who had spent some years in the
Indian prison in connection with the _Meerut Conspiracy Case_
and with another British Communist R Palme Dutt. S Gopal,
the biographer of Nehru, stated:

>He (Nehru) agreed that the Congress was, on the whole,
moving towards the right, but was himself willing to work
in close collaboration with Communists. He was not well-read
in Marxism but was persuaded of its vitality and
emotionally inclines toward it. He also had a deep admiration
for the achievements of the Soviet Union. Russia
was the land of future. ... Civil liberties to Jawaharlal
was of absolute value, and the Communists had to reckon
with this.[^19/2]

[^19/2]: Sarvepalli Gopal, _Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography_, Vol I, Bombay, Oxford
University Press, 1976, p. 202.

In other words, Nehru desired the kind of economic and
social transformations that the Soviet Union was undergoing
to take place in India and other countries in the world 'without
the use of force'. He did not accept _class struggle_, the
basic principle of Marxism-Leninism, its logical conclusions
of dictatorship of the _proletariat_, etc.

Here one can perceive both the agreement and disagreement
between a top ranking Congress leader like Nehru
and the Communists. As compared to 1929, Nehru came
closer to the Communists. The rise of fascism and the role
played by Communists in the fight against it brought him
to take this position. At the same time, he believed that the
Congress led by Gandhi was the only organization capable
of carrying forward successfully the struggle for India's
national independence. Nehru assured Bradley and Dutt that
he was prepared to cooperate with the _Communist Party_,
provided the Communists realized this fact and worked
accordingly.

Following these talks, an article entitled _The anti-Imperialist People's Front in India_ under the joint authorship
of Dutt and Bradely appeared in _Labour Monthly_ in
March 1936. In the article they stated that although the
Congress was the main mass organization of the different
sections of people striving for national liberation, it had not
yet risen as the united front of the Indian people. The article
pointed out that if it had to rise to that position, the constitution,
programme and the leadership of the Congress had to
change. The article further suggested that the organizations
of the workers and peasants and other mass organizations
must either be brought into a fighting front associated with
the Congress, or they must be affiliated to the Congress. At
the local, district, provincial and all-India levels, these organizations
must be given collective membership and a united
fighting organization formed immediately with their participation.

Further, the article also suggested an organizational form
in which the ranks would be able to take better initiative in
place of the centralized organization with the domination of
the _Working Committee_. That is, there must be democratic
centralization, instead of a leadership of the individual.

In sum, the Congress as a whole must be reformed
making its function more democratic with better position from
the labouring masses. The _Dutt-Bradley_ article also contained
suggestions with regard to the Gandhian _non-violence_
and the approach the Congress must take towards the _constitutional
reforms_ enacted by the British government.

These were the suggestions acceptable not only to the
Communists but also to other leftists. Nehru had indicated
in his _Autobiography_ that the contents of this article were
acceptable to him. In any case, he had included the objectives
and slogans contained in the _Dutt-Bradley_ article in his presidential
address at the Lucknow session.

But many of these suggestions turned out to be the target
of attack from the right-wing leadership of the Congress and
certain others were accepted by them. The spokesmen of
the left-wing forcefully argued for those suggestions which
were rejected by the right-wing, for which they had the
backing of a considerable section of the delegates. However,
those suggestions which were opposed by the right-wing were
rejected by the session.

There was a significant difference between the situation
now and that prevailed in the Bombay session held a year
and a half ago. There was not one leftist leader in the
Congress with Nehru's stature in the Bombay session, whereas
now the voices of the left were heard right through the presidential
address.

One of the reasons for this situation was, of course, the
personal contribution made by Nehru. But it would have
been impossible for Nehru to take such a clear stand, nor
would have been the right-wing leadership compelled to listen
to him, had there not been the kind of changes in the international
and national politics we have described above.

## NEHRU'S MARXISM AND INDIAN _BOURGEOISIE_

As we have seen in the preceding section, many thought
that Jawaharlal Nehru had been showing leanings towards
Communism in the early 1930s. In particular, basing on the
articles Nehru had written in this period and on his speeches
and press interviews, Bipan Chandra stated that the years 1933--36 constituted the period in which he was in "his most
'Marxist' phase".[^19/3]

[^19/3]: Bipan Chandra, Jawaharlal Nehru and the Capitalist class, 1936,
_Economic and Political Weekly_, Special Number, 1975, pp. 1307--1374.

Bipan Chandra tried to establish that rather than talking
vaguely about Socialism, Nehru expressed faith in _class
struggle_, the corner stone of Marxism, and emphasized that
it was a fact of life and not the creation of some agitators and
philosophers. Bipan Chandra also pointed out that Nehru
accepted the Marxist theory of state as well as the necessity
of revolutionary struggle against this oppressive instrument
of the exploiting classes. This was also the period, according
to him, in which Nehru's estrangement with the _bourgeois_
ideologies and policies including Gandhism, reached its peak,
as evidenced by his presidential address at the Lucknow session
of the Congress.

We have noted that Gandhi and other right-wing Congress
leaders had been endeavouring to negotiate and arrive
at a compromise with the Viceroy following the failure of
the 1932 struggle. Bipan Chandra has pointed out that in parallel
to and as part of these attempts, the Indian industrialist
GD Birla had conducted negotiations with the rulers with
the blessings of Gandhi. Birla directly and Gandhi indirectly
through Birla had assured the British that Congress, regardless
of objections, was prepared to bring into force the
_constitutional reforms_ in India. But Nehru and the left-wing
_Congressmen_ led by him were opposed to this, Bipan
Chandra pointed out.

The main political problem which came up before the
Lucknow session was the attitude of Congress towards the
_constitutional reforms_. Although the Congress was opposed
to the reforms, it did not formulate a programme of _boycott_
of the legislature as it did in the case of the 1919 reforms.
The futility of the _boycott_ programme and the subsequent
formation of the _Swaraj Party_ earlier had taught the
_Congressmen_ including Gandhi a lesson.

Even the left-wing _Congressmen_ who expressed emotional
opposition to the adoption of the parliamentary programme
by the leadership in 1934 did not demand _boycott_ of elections
that were going to be held in accordance with the provisions
of the new constitution. Instead, they suggested adopting a
policy of obstructionist tactics inside the legislature and
organizing agitations outside it.

The question arose if the Congress would go in for
forming ministries in the provinces in the event it obtained
majority in the legislatures after the elections. The right-wing
_Congressmen_ argued that the formation of ministries
was the logical extension of participation in the elections.
They thought that accepting office would further strengthen
the Congress, which would enable them to bargain with the
authorities in a better way. However, this policy was forcefully
opposed by the left-wing. They feared that if the
Congress accepted office, it would lose the character of a
fighting organization it had acquired. They also feared that
instead of fighting against the British imperialism, the
Congress ministers, as part of the British administrative
machinery, would be compelled to take actions against the
people. This opinion was in fact expressed by Nehru in his
Lucknow presidential address. Nehru stated:

>Behind it (acceptance of office) lies, somewhat hidden,
the question of independence and whether we seek revolutionary
changes in India or are working for part reforms
under the aegis of British imperialism. ... To accept office
and ministry, under the conditions of the Act, is to negative
our rejection of it, and to stand self-condemned.
National honour and self-respect cannot accept this position,
for it would inevitably mean our cooperation, in
some measure with the repressive apparatus of imperialism,
and we would become partners in this repression and in
the exploitation of our people.[^19/4]

[^19/4]: A. M. Zaidi and S. G. Zaidi (eds), _The Encyclopaedia of Indian National
Congress_, Vol. II, New Delhi, Chand Co., pp. 100--101.

There was a related organizational problem. Nehru
supported in his presidential address the leftist proposal to
democratize the Congress by giving collective affiliation to
the workers' and peasants' and other mass organizations and
by assigning active roles to the Congress units at the lowest
level and to the ordinary _Congressmen_. The opposition to
the acceptance of office and the proposals for democratization
of the Congress constituted a political and organizational
challenge to the right-wing leadership. Bipan Chandra points
out that Nehru's merit in the period 1933--36 consisted in
that he acted as the spokesman of Communists, Socialists
and other leftist _Congressmen_ in raising this challenge.

According to Bipan Chandra, it was not an expression
of the contradiction between _bourgeois_ ideology and Socialism,
but a conflict between two approaches in regard to the
_freedom struggle_. He says:

> ...he (Nehru) challenged the
basic nationalist political strategy followed by the Congress
leadership since the 1880s --- _i.e_, the strategy of advancing
towards political power and independence by stages arrived
at through a series of compromises to be forced on the colonial
power through the application of ever-increasing political
pressure. ... I have described this strategy as that of _Pressure ---Compromise---Pressure_. ...[^19/5]

[^19/5]: Bipan Chandra, _op. cit_, p. 1309.

Bipan Chandra's analysis was as follows:

>In the concrete
Indian political situation of 1934--36, the dominant
congress leadership and the leadership of the Indian capitalist
class felt that the _stage of pressure_ or _active struggle_ was
over and the _stage of compromise_, _co-operation_, and '_goodwill_'
had to be ushered in. They had been quietly working
towards a political compromise, in fact, since the end of 1933, for the _civil disobedience movement_ had definitely
petered out by that time. ... Gandhi and dominant right-wing
leadership of the Congress strained all their nerves to prevent
the Congress form adopting a policy of office-rejection. ...
This was very clearly brought out by the encouragement
that Gandhi gave to GD Birla to bring about a spirit of
mutual trust and 'personal touch' between the rulers and the
Congress leadership in general and Gandhi in particular".[^19/6]

[^19/6]: _Ibid_.

Bipan Chandra tries to make it appear that the approach
of the spokesman of the leftists, Nehru, was a counter
to this tactics of the _bourgeoisie_. The opposition to the
acceptance of office, according to Bipan Chandra, was in fact
an opposition to the tactics of compromise. The indication
here is that Nehru and his associates were trying to adopt
a tactics of "_Pressure---Victory_" (_i.e_, uncompromising struggles
till the victory is achieved) in place of the '_Pressure---Compromise---Pressure_'
tactics adopted by Gandhi and other
right-wing Congress leaders.

The facts we have presented so far would show that
this analysis is basically erroneous. The constantly developing
_bourgeoisie_ had been striving to exert more and more
pressure on imperialism and to acquire more and more powers
making use of this pressure. The adoption of the "extremist"
programme under the leadership of Tilak and later of
the "non-violent _non-cooperation_ programme" under Gandhi's
leadership by the Congress originally started as a 'moderate'
organization were developments that revealed this truth. As
indicated in the preceding chapters, it was as part of implementing
this same programme that the Congress proceeded
along the line of the formation of the _Swaraj Party_, the
initiative taken by the left-wing _Congressmen_ for the adoption
of _Purna Swaraj_ and the consequent Lahore session, the _civil
disobedience movement_ that followed and so on.

It was as part of the same strategy that Nehru's name was
proposed by Gandhi himself as the president of the Lahore
session. And he was again made the president at the Lucknow
session by Gandhi and the right-wing leadership. As we are
going to see in the following pages, the same right-wing
leadership extended the presidentship of Nehru for another
year and appointed another leader of the left-wing, Subhas
Bose to succeed Nehru. It must be mentioned specifically
that it was not on account of the pressure from the left-wing
that the right-wing leadership appointed leftists consecutively
for three years; it was on its own free will. Why did the
leadership make such a choice? In order to find an answer
to this question, we would have to establish that the very
basis of Bipan Chandra's analyses was wrong.

_First_, it is not consistent with facts to maintain that the
right-wing Congress leadership gave up the strategy of
"_Pressure---Compromise---Pressure_" and adopted exclusively the
approach of compromise. It is true that both Gandhi and
Birla were moving with an intention of reaching a final compromise.
But the _bourgeois_ leadership knew that this was
not easy to bring about. They were convinced that a final
compromise would be possible only through increasing the
pressure.

_Second_, it is equally wrong to state that the strategy
adopted by Nehru was one of "_Pressure---Victory_" in place of
the strategy of "_Pressure---Compromise---Pressure_". Although
Nehru had often pursued policies which were for the time
being opposed to that of the right-wing leadership, his
fundamental political outlook (even during 1933--36) was that
of the Congress. While opposing the opinions of Gandhi
and other right-wing Congress leaders on various political
issues in words, he had always submitted himself in action
to the Congress discipline. This was the main factor which
motivated the right-wing Congress leaders to nominate Nehru
to the presidentship of the Congress now at the Lucknow
session as it was in the case of the Lahore session. Bipan
Chandra himself has cited certain statements made by Gandhi
and Birla which would lend support to this. Let us also
note in passing that even during the 1933--36 period in which,
according to Bipan Chandra, Nehru had accepted the Marxist
theory of _class struggle_, he looked at the Congress under the
_bourgeois_ leadership as the only platform for the struggle
against imperialism.

_Third_, it is advantageous for the pressure tactics of the _bourgeoisie_
to install the leftist Nehru whom they were confident
of "taming" as the president of the Congress and thereby to
create the impression that leftist outlook was growing in the
organization. In order for the acceptance of office and the
subsequent efforts to become effective, there must have a
leadership capable of inspiring and unleashing the left
forces in the country. The person best suited for that purpose
was Jawaharlal Nehru. The _bourgeois_ leadership was
in need of a president with leaning towards Marxism and
outwardly opposed to right-wing ideologies including Gandhism.
In the absence of such a leftist backing, it would have
been impossible for them even to make an attempt for compromise
with the rulers.

In his article, Bipan Chandra cites an incident which
clearly reveals this fact. A group of Bombay capitalists who
were angered at the Lucknow presidential address of Nehru
issued a statement sharply condemning him and also criticizing
the Congress leadership which made him the president
of the Congress. Another prominent capitalist of Bombay,
Purushottamdas Thakurdas, who did not quite agree with
this approach exchanged a number of letters with GD Birla
on this subject.

The Birla-Thakurdas correspondence revealed what
that section of the Indian capitalists who are described as
"the more far-sighted" had in mind. It revealed their confidence
that no matter what game Nehru played with words,
there was no ground for them to get frightened, became
Gandhi and other right-wing leaders of the Congress would
be able to contain him. The exchange of correspondence
also revealed that Gandhi and other right-wing Congress
leaders had assured these leading capitalists that the final
decision of the Congress with regard to the acceptance of
office would go in favour of it regardless of the opposition
of Nehru and other left-wing leaders towards it.

In any case, subsequent events have demonstrated the
materialization of the optimism displayed by Gandhi,
Birla and Thakurdas that the _bourgeoisie_ would be able to
"tame" Nehru who had been making leftist speeches, and the
falsity of the analysis of Bipan Chandra made on the basis.
of Nehru's speeches and articles that in the years 1933--36
Nehru had reached "his most 'Marxist' phase". Nehru
was a tool of the _bourgeois_ tactics of "_Pressure---Compromise---Pressure_".
It was a period in which the Indian _bourgeoisie_
was in need of a leader verbally favouring Marxism and
opposing Gandhism in order for their pressure tactics to
succeed.

## THE LUCKNOW SESSION: AN EVALUATION

Two principal issues raised by the Congress President
Nehru and other leftist _Congressmen_ at the Lucknow session,
namely, opposition to the acceptance of office, and actions
for democratizing Congress organization including collective
affiliation to trade unions and other mass organizations
--- were not accepted by the Congress.

The issue of acceptance of office was deferred by the
session. A resolution adopted by the Congress to this effect
stated:

>The question of acceptance or non-acceptance of
office by Congress members elected to the legislatures under
the constitution, having been agitated in the country, the Congress,
in view of the uncertainties of the situation as it may
develop, considers it advisable to commit itself to any
decision at this stage on the question and leaves it to be
decided _at the proper time_ by the _AICC_ after consulting the
_Provincial Congress Committees (PCC)_.[^19/7]

[^19/7]: Zaidi and Zaidi (eds), _op. cit_, p. 33. (Italics added).

In deferring a decision on this matter, the Congress was,
in effect, rejecting the arguments of the leftists. The issue
of acceptance or non-acceptance of office was a fundamental
problem relating to the approach towards the British rulers.
What lay behind the debate on the acceptance of office was
the question whether the Congress would adopt the method of
compromise with the British rulers on the basis of the reforms
that were being introduced step by step or it would organize
the people on a revolutionary basis and establish a free
democratic state by the people themselves after victoriously
destroying the foundations of the British rule. If it accepted
the latter, for which Nehru and other leftist leaders were
arguing in the Lucknow session, then the question of taking
a decision "at the proper time" as stated in the resolution
did not arise. Deferring the decision meant that Congress
might take a decision in favour of acceptance of office some
time in future (that is, when the situation became favourable).

The Congress, on the other hand, outrightly rejected
the issue of democratization of the Congress by giving collective
affiliation to trade unions and other mass organizations.
The leadership was not prepared to consider this issue. It
maintained that the Congress was not against the trade
unions and other mass organizations growing in strength
and that it was even prepared to take an attitude favourable
to their growth. But it insisted that these organizations
should be made to accept the leadership of the Congress.
For this purpose the Congress would form a workers sub-commtttee
to give "guidance and leadership" to those _Congressmen_
working in trade unions.

This was not merely an organizational problem; behind
it lay the differences of opinion between the left-wing and
right-wing on the question of building the _anti-imperialist_
front. By the _anti-imperialist_ front the leftists meant
creating a great mass upsurge against the imperialist forces
by rallying the masses jointly by the Congress, _Congress
Socialist_ and Communist parties, the trade unions and other
mass organizations. On the other hand, the right-wing interpreted
the front as the Socialist and Communist parties and
the mass organizations like the trade unions strengthening the
Congress by accepting its political leadership, thereby regarding
the Congress as the _anti-imperialist_ front. Rejecting
the proposal put forward by the leftists meant acceptance
of the latter interpretation by the Congress.

In sum, although the leftists made a good performance
with many major and minor speeches, including the presidential
address, all the proposals put forward by them were rejected
at the Lucknow session. Some historians have tried to
characterize this as a defeat for the leftists. Bipan Chandra,
for instance, says:

>From now on, the chief role of the
masses was to listen to his speeches. In ideology, not Marxism
but a mild form of Fabianism become the norm, though once
in a while there came flashes of his old Marxism.[^19/8]

[^19/8]: Bipan Chandra, _op. cit_, p. 1321.

Whether this was true or false of Nehru is not relevant
now. But what is relevant is the question of how did the leftists
in general react to these developments. Did they feel that they
were defeated? Did they consider, as Nehru is reported to have
felt, that it was futile to fight against the right-wing leadership
and bence need not continue ?

The leftists, except a few like Nehru, did not have any
illusion that they would succeed in getting all their proposals
accepted by the Congress, that too, in a single conference.

The Communists who regarded that the Congress was
the political party of Indian _bourgeoisie_ viewed the fight
between the left and right sections in the Congress as an
important form of _class struggle_. They never had the illusion
which Nehru and the _Congress Socialists_ had with regard to
the political character of the Congress. They knew that the
_anti-imperialist_ front would emerge only out of the clashes
between the compromising policy of the _bourgeois_ politicians
dominating the Congress and the uncompromising attitude of
the masses rallied behind them. Even the _Congress Socialists_
were working with the understanding that the struggle
against the right-wing leadership inside the Congress would
be an intense one.

A majority of left-wing _Congressmen_ who belonged
to neither of these groups, on the other hand, examined the
whole developments form the point of view of whether or
not the Lucknow session gave a new impetus to the struggle
they had started and not whether or not the struggle
they put up on the platform of the session turned out to
be effective for the time being. And looked from this
angle, they had sufficient reason to remain contented. Whatever
the decisions of the Congress session, the proceedings
of the session turned out to be useful in taking the issue
they had raised jointly with Communists and Socialists to
the delegates and the common people. They were able to
bring about a change in the thinking of a considerable
section of the people who had not yet taken part in the activities
of the Communist and Socialist parties or in the left
movements. The Lucknow session also helped them to
extend to a large section of the people the revolutionary
perspective with regard to the _constitutional reforms_ and
the practical problems relating to them which had hitherto
been confined to narrow groups. In other words, in the
Lucknow session they were able to organize to a great extent
the leftist forces for the coming struggles between the left
and the right.

In order to make use of these favourable situations effectively,
certain other activities were also organized outside
the conference, which brought far-reaching effects. The
"_anti-imperialist_ rally" held during the interval in the
conference venue deserves particular mention. The rally
which was organized on the initiative of Communists and
Socialists attracted a large section of the delegates. The
organizers of the rally tried to examine the problems of Indian
_freedom struggle_ in the background of international developments,
the danger of war that rose in the wake of the rise of
fascism and the role of British imperialism in it. Discussions
were held which inspired the ordinary _Congressmen_ to wage
a more effective struggle against the right-wing leadership
with a clear idea of how to conduct the mass struggles against
the _Government of India Act_ which was fabricated by the
imperialist rulers and of the weakness of the Congress in conducting
such struggles. This helped to lay a strong ideological
and political foundation to the _anti-imperialist_ front that the
Communists, Socialists and other leftists were striving to build.

The _Communist Party_ also distributed a leaflet in the
venue of the conference explaining its stand on various
issues. It may be noted that since the party had been banned
since 1934, this could not be done openly and legally. Despite
this, many Socialist activists and Congress volunteers helped
the Communists in distributing the leaflet extensively in the
delegate camps and in the conference _Pantal_. A number of
leaders in the _Reception Committee_ and _AICC_ also extended
cooperation to the Communists in the distribution of the
leaflets. The successful _anti-imperialist_ rally and the distribution
of the Communist leaflet were indications to the fact
that not only certain top Congress leaders like Nehru but a
considerable section of the ordinary _Congressmen_ and
delegates had started getting attracted to the ideologies of
Communism and Socialism. The ordinary _Congressmen_
who had been fed up with Gandhism, parliamentarianism and
the waverings and pusillanimity displayed by Nehru who had
been indulging in leftist rhetorics were yearning for a new
programme and were eagerly looking upon the Communist and
Socialist parties which had been giving leadership for taking
the national movement in a new direction. Opportunities
were opening up for a fruitful exchange of views among
ordinary _Congressmen_ and the representatives of the Communist
and Socialist parties as well as for practical cooperation
among them.

The emergence of _All-India Kisan Sabha_ was another
important event that took place in the venue of the Lucknow
session. The grounds for this had, in fact, been cleared
earlier. Peasant agitations had been going on for quite
some time in the different provinces in different forms according
to the specific characteristics of each province. In many
of these agitations the leadership was with the Congress. Consequently,
they did not assume the form of a regular peasant
organization. These were, in fact, attempts to bring the
peasant under the Congress.

It was in the early 1930s that peasant organizations
began to emerge at local and provincial levels. Even at this
stage the leadership of a major section was with the Congress.
With the expansion of the activities of the Communist and
Socialist parties, the activists of the leftist parties began to
take part in the activities among the peasants. For example, it
was the left _Congressmen_ who were also the Congress-Socialists
who laid the foundation for the peasant movement in
the Malabar region. With this, workers functioning in the
peasant movements began to feel the need of a central organization
for the peasant movement like the _AITUC_ for the
trade unions. Accordingly, a preparatory conference of the
workers in the peasant movements was held in January 1936
at Meerut while the _Congress Socialist Party_ was holding its
Second _All-India Conference_ there. The Meerut Conference
formed an organizing committee with NG Ranga and
Jayaprakash Narayan as joint conveners to organize an _All-India
Kisan Conference_. The Lucknow conference was a
result of the activities of this committee.

The Lucknow conference was attended by Swami Sahajanand
Saraswati and Indulal Yagnik who later became
prominent leaders of Indian peasant movement, and
NG Ranga, a leftist leader who later turned to the _rightist_
camp. The name of the organization formed in that conference
was _All-India Kisan Congress (AIKC)_, also called the _All-India
Kisan Sangh_ by some, which was further changed to _All-India
Kisan Sabha_. The Lucknow conference is regarded as the
founding conference of the Sabha.

It may be noted that the _All-India Kisan Sabha_ was
formed 16 years after the formation of _All-Indian Trade
Union Congress_. The peasants had hitherto been depending
on the Congress not only for the solution of political problems
including that of national freedom but also for getting their
immediate demands conceded. (This was also the position
with workers till the formation of the _AITUC_.) But the growth
of the left parties, the emergence of the _anti-imperialist_
front and the influence it was able to gain even within the
Congress exerted considerable influence among the peasants.
They began to work with the perspective of forming an
independent class organization of their own and fighting against
British imperialism by joining hands with all other mass
organizations and political parties including the Congress. The
_All-India Kisan Conference_ held in Lucknow provided leadership
for these activities.

The main resolution adopted by the conference set the
objective of the _Kisan Congress_ as complete liberation of
peasants from economic exploitation and achievement of
economic and political power to peasants, workers and other
exploited sections of the people. The resolution stated that
the task of the _Kisan Congress_ was to organize peasants to
fight for their immediate political and economic demands and
to obtain liberation from exploitation. The resolution called
upon the peasants to actively participate in the struggles for
_complete independence_ for India so as to enable the producing
masses to obtain ultimate economic and political power.

The conference adopted two more resolutions which
were of considerable importance. One of them demanded
_abolition of landlordism_ which had been existing in different
forms such as _Zamindari_, _Taluqdari_, _Malguzari_, _Estemardari_,
_Khot_, _Jenmi_, _Inamdari_, etc., and conferring landownership
on the cultivating peasants. The other resolution demanded
radical change in the land tax system in the _Ryotwari_ regions
and the introduction of a graduated system of tax, exempting
peasants with income less than Rs 500 from payment of
land tax.

These resolutions constituted an outline of the policies of
the _Kisan Sabha_. The conference elected a _Central Kisan
Committee_ with Swami Sahajanand as president and NG
Ranga as secretary and also an AIKC with larger membership.

Yet another event that took place in the venue of the
Congress session was the formation of _All-India Progressive
Writers' Association_ for which the inspiration came from the
organization of _anti-fascist_ writers led by Maxim Gorki and
other progressive writers in Europe. Formed on the initiative
of the Communists, it had the blessings of Rabindranath
Tagore, Sarojini Naidu, Munshi Premchand and other top-ranking
writers in the country. The Lucknow conference of
Indian writers which was presided over by Premchand was
an indication to suggest that the messages of the _anti-imperialist
front_ and the _anti-fascist international front_ had started
making impacts on the _intelligentsia_ in India.

All in all, although the Lucknow session of the Congress
rejected the resolutions introduced by the left-wing, the
event that took place inside and outside the conference
_Pantal_ demonstrated that the ideas propagated by them had
started spreading far and wide. It had also become obvious
that Communists and Socialists were leading these movements.
