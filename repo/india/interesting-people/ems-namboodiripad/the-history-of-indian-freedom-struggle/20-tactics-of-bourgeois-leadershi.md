# TACTICS OF _BOURGEOIS_ LEADERSHIP

## AFTER THE LUCKNOW SESSION

Although there was a similarity between the Lahore and
Lucknow sessions of the Congress in that the right-wing
leadership decided to install a known leftist as president for
both these sessions, the political backgrounds of these decisions
were different. The Lahore session was held at a time
when even the right-wing leadership had taken a position
in which it was impossible to avoid country-wide mass agitation
against the British rulers. In order for them to make this
agitation country-wide, they had to secure the whole-hearted
cooperation of the leftists. Therefore, not only did they install
Nehru as the president of the session, they also took over the
slogan of _Full Independence_ raised by leftists represented by
him. Thus, both the president of the Lahore session and the
decisions taken in that session helped create the impression
that politically the Congress was moving towards the left.

The background of the Lucknow session was completely
different. It had become certain that the immediate objective
of the right-wing Congress leadership was to arrive at a
compromise with the British rulers and not a struggle against
them. For that purpose, they had to have inspiring policy
declarations and a suitable president. However, the leadership
could not afford to accept the suggestion of the president
and the left-wing to reject office, for they would achieve
their objective of compromise with the rulers only by making
use of favourable situations emerging out of office acceptance.
Besides, the proposals put forward by the left-wing (collective
affiliation to mass organizations, etc.) for democratizing
the Congress organization were regarded extremely dangerous
by the right-wing leadership. Consequently, they could not
but defeat right in the Conference the proposals put forward
by the left-wing president. Thus, the right-wing leadership
adopted the policy of rejecting all the proposals put forward
by Nehru, while keeping him in the presidentship. The state
of affairs that prevailed within the Congress leadership as a
consequence of these developments has been described by
Pattabhi Sitaramayya as follows:

>The President was out of tune with the majority of the
_Working Committee_. The three new friends (_Congress
Socialists_) taken into it would, with him make a good _four_
or more than a fourth of the Committee but generally
speaking the deliberations and decisions were not conditioned
or conducted by majorities and minorities. Jawaharlal
had offered his resignation at the very outset, but he was
persuaded to remain and continue. Continue he did but
qualms of conscience which created uneasy feelings in his
presidential address which was not meant to be a mere
thesis but a programme of action. On the other, there
was Gandhi with his following of ten members in the
_Working Committee_ thinking and acting as a solid block.[^20/1]

[^20/1]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _The History of Indian National Congress_, Vol II,
Bombay, Padma Publications, 1947, p. 13.

What motivated Nehru to remain a prisoner of the
majority in the _Working Committee_ while occupying the
presidentship of the Congress? What motivated the right-wing
Congress leaders to keep him in the presidentship in such
a condition? According to his biographer, Sarvepally Gopal:

>By now Jawaharlal was as indispensable to the Congress
as the party was to him. He commanded, even before his
election tours gave him a wide popular appeal, the support
of large sections of radical youth who, but for him, would
have left the Congress for left-wing parties. Even the
_Congress Socialist Party_ might have broken away from the
parent body. ... He was, too, the only Indian politician who
had an international audience, and it was he who secured
for the party recognition on the world stage. Had
Jawaharlal, therefore, insisted in the summer of 1936 on
resigning the presidency, it is difficult to believe that
Gandhi and his followers would have been shortsighted
enough to let him do so.[^20/2]

[^20/2]: S. Gopal, _op. cit_ p. 214.

Why did then Nehru submit himself to this situation?
His biographer adds:

>The psychological hankering to follow Gandhi and the
ingrained loyalty to the party were only part of the
explanation. Jawaharlal Nehru knew that there was no
working-class leadership or even an alternative elite leadership
available; and as long as this was the case, it would
ed disastrous to weaken the Congress. And, as ever, his
colleagues took advantage of this.[^20/3]

[^20/3]: _Ibid_.

Our discussions in the preceding chapter show that this
analysis is incorrect. An alternate leadership in which the
working class had active roles had been emerging and getting
strong day by day. The Lucknow session had shown that
the influence of this emergent alternate leadership was by
no means small. The truth was that other than making
policy statements like the Lucknow presidential speech
Nehru was not prepared to put up an uncompromising fight
against the views of the right-wing in accordance with the
contents of his declarations.

As S Gopal has pointed out, Nehru's views were full
of contradictions and his political outlook weak. His
seemingly Marxist philosophical outlook and his leanings
towards the political slogans of the _anti-imperialist_ front
that included Communists and Socialists were found reflected
throughout in his speeches and writings. However, his actions
were limited within the ambit of discipline of the Congress
led by the _bourgeoisie_.

As we are going to see in the following pages, whenever
the contradiction between the left-wing and the right-wing
became acute, Nehru either gave up his own position and
surrendered to the right-wing leadership, or remained neutral.
Never did he stand firm with the left-wing to effectively
challenge the right-wing. However, a few weeks after the
Lucknow session Nehru came in clash with the right-wing
leadership of the Congress. Although the proposals he had
put forward in his presidential address had been rejected by
the Congress, he continued to make speeches and write
articles which resembled in content his presidential address.

Not only the capitalists of Bombay as we have noted
earlier, but many right-wing Congress leaders like Vallabhbhai
Patel, Rajendra Prasad and Rajagopalachari severely
criticized him for the opinions he expressed. Following,
Nehru offered his resignation, an action which was disapproved
by Gandhi why advised him to submit to the majority
of the _Working Committee_ and work without creating problems.
The right-wing leadership in the Congress and the
'moderates' outside it stood witness to Nehru's acceptance
of Gandhi's advice and to the disappearance from his speeches
and writings of the "triumphant freshness" which had been
found expressed in them earlier.

This process of change in Nehru reached the zenith as
preparations began for contesting the elections scheduled to
be held in early 1937. We shall return to it in the following
chapters. Before that we shall refer to certain activities of
Nehru to which the right-wing leadership had no objection.

By 1936 the world political atmosphere was becoming
dark. Abyssinia became the victim of aggression of fascists in
Italy. In Spain, rebellion broke out under the leadership of
Franco against the elected government. Added to these were
the inhuman regime of Hitler who had already come to power
in Germany and Japan's war of aggression against China,
which together gave rise to peoples' ire against imperialist
powers which were rendering assistance to the fascist forces
around the world.

This had its reflection in India also. The _Congress
Working Committee_ decided to observe 9th May as
"Abyssinia Day". The _Working Committee_ also deputed
VK Krishna Menon to represent the Congress in the
_World Peace Conference_ which was scheduled to be held in
Brussels in September 1936, and in the _World Peace Congress_
which were organized jointly by the Socialists, Communists
and certain sections of _bourgeois_ political parties in Europe.
And it was a part of these activities that Nehru visited Spain
and sent aids to the spanish democrats.

Nehru considered that this was the symbol of the leftist
views he was representing. The right-wing leadership thought
this would help, like many other things, to create popular
pressure which was needed to achieve the objective of
compromise with the British rulers, because any move against
fascism would also turn against the British rulers. The
message sent by Nehru to the _World Peace Congress_ stated:

>... I should like to emphasize that peace in colonial
countries can only be established with the removal of
imperialist domination for imperialism is itself a negation
of peace. Therefore, for us in India, as well as for other
countries, situated like us, the first step must be political
freedom, to be followed, I hope, by social freedom.
Thus, we shall be able to build up our country, in common
with the rest of the world, an enduring foundation for peace
and freedom and human progress.[^20/4]

[^20/4]: _Collected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru_, Vol 7, New Delhi, Orient Longman, 1975, p. 577.

In order to rouse world public opinion and fight for civil
liberties in India, a _Civil Liberties Union_ was formed on
Nehru's initiative. The Union endeavoured to collect information
on the violation of civil liberties in foreign countries
and also to provide similar information on the violation of
civil liberties in India to foreigners. According to the official
historian of the Congress, Pattabhi Sitaramayya:

>In India ... where no rights exist for the people, when the
so-called constitution itself is undemocratic and is a standing
negation of civil rights and popular liberties, a Union such
as the one contemplated would be more or less an imitation,
unless, it super-arrogated itself the whole range of stupendous
task undertaken and carried on with success by _Indian National
Congress_ for over half a century. For the _Civil Liberties
Union_ that is contemplated should in any case of India
strive to _establish_ civil liberties in the first place, not merely
_preserve_ them as in the case of France, America and England.
But one justification we can sense instantly and instinctively.
The Union that was being established in 1936 might form the
nucleus of that larger union which must necessarily function
even after India shall have established a full democratic constitution.[^20/5]

[^20/5]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _op. cit_, p. 21.

We have referred earlier to Nehru's opinion on the
Communist approach to civil liberties. Nehru considered
civil liberties as a set of values which had to be unconditionally
preserved always and everywhere and declared that he
was opposed to violation of civil liberties to introduce
revolutionary change in the economic and social life as in
the Soviet Union. Therefore, the _Civil Liberties Union_
formed under the leadership of Nehru was meant to serve
the dual purpose of opposing the repressive actions of the
British rulers in India and laying the foundation of future
Indian democracy.

Thus, the right-wing Congress leaders left Nehru free
to work in the areas of fascist aggression and preparation
for war at the international level and against the violation
of civil liberties at the national level with which they had no
quarrel, while preserving their domination over the Congress
organization.

## PREPARATIONS FOR ELECTIONS

For those who retain in memory the fact that it was on
the slogan of _boycott_ of legislatures and other institutions
that Gandhi brought the masses to the battleground, it may
appear surprising to see the Congress making preparations
for elections without ruling out the probability of accepting
office after winning the elections. But no one who examines
objectively the growth of the _bourgeoisie_ which controlled
the Congress politically and organizationally would find anything
surprising in it.

The _bourgeois_ political leadership came to the fore with
a programme of agitations and struggles first under Tilak's
leadership and later under Gandhi's when it was felt necessary
to mobilize the people discarding the style of work of the
earlier generation of 'moderates'. And it was the same leadership
which gained self-confidence through the struggles for
over a decade came to the conclusion that it was possible to
negotiate and reach compromise with the rulers without giving
up the programme of rallying the masses behind itself.

While this was the position with the right-wing leadership,
the leftists did not favour the approach of boycotting
elections either. They understood that elections and battles
in the legislature had an important place in organizing the
people against imperialism and its Indian agents. As Lenin
pointed out in the midst of a controversy in the world
Communist movement on the same issue, the argument
against parliamentary activities was an "_infantile disorder_"
that had affected the revolutionary movement. The world
revolutionary working class movement rejected both the right
opportunist view of the possibility of bringing revolution by
contesting elections and using parliamentary majority and
the left opportunism of keeping aloof from _class struggles_
on the scene of parliamentary activities. The _Communist
Party_ which had been organized on the basis of this ideological
position, and the _Congress Socialist Party_ viewed the
electoral activities as an important means to strengthen the
_anti-imperialist_ struggle. However, the Communists, _Congress
Socialists_ and other leftists differed from the right-wing
leadership, including Gandhi, on the question of why and
how to participate in the elections. The leftists were opposed
to the right-wing approach of entering the legislatures and
forming ministries wherever there was a majority strictly in
conformity with the provisions of the constitution and using
the authority and power thus acquired to bargain with the
imperialist rulers. They, on the other hand, tried to create
a revolutionary mass movement by combining the majority
in the legislatures with people's force outside the legislatures.
They adopted the approach of "_wrecking the constitution_"
with popular force and framing a constitution for India by
a _constituent assembly_ which would be constituted by the
people in the process of this struggle.

On that basis and as an integral part of the process of
"_wrecking the constitution_", the Communist and Socialist
parties were pondering independently and collectively how
best the election propaganda could be used, what were the
policies and programmes needed for building the _anti-imperialist_
front and now to propagate the programmes of these
parties independently while propagating the common programmes
of the _front_ and so on. The right-wing Congress
leadership, the leftist Congress president and his Socialist
colleagues in the _Working Committee_ also paid attention to
these problems.

As a result of the discussions that took place at
different levels, the _Communist Party_, the _Congress Socialist
Party_ and other leftist parties adopted their respective programmes
which, however, failed to create any impact on the
masses. The election manifesto of the Congress, on the other
hand, attracted the people. The election propaganda conducted
by the Congress leaders in general and Nehru in
particular based on the manifesto, despite the constraints
placed by the right-wing leadership, helped the spread of
the _anti-imperialist_ views represented by Nehru among the
people.

The nature and character of the Congress leadership
was, in fact, reflected in its election manifesto. For instance,
although the right-wing leaders had already decided to form
ministries wherever the Congress won a majority in the
elections, the manifesto remained silent on the subject. On
the other hand, it contained an inspiring call for _anti-imperialist_
struggles.

The Congress election manifesto was written by Nehru
as it was the case with many other documents which had
become beneficial to the right-wing in the Congress. Therefore,
it would sound to the people under the influence of the leftists
that it embodied their hopes and aspirations. Moreover,
Nehru conducted the election propaganda in such a way as
to strengthen this impression. But the question of forming
ministries was left open in the manifesto.

The manifesto began with a description of the deepening
economic crisis and the problems of increasing unemployment
and poverty. It reiterated that the only condition for
the solution of these problems is the attainment of independence.
It emphasized the fact that the struggle for independence
had ended up in the suppression of civil liberties. The
manifesto specifically stated that the Congress had rejected
the constitution prepared in these backgrounds and that the
activities inside the legislature was one of the facets of the
struggle to get it rescinded.

What was the nature of activities contemplated in the
legislature? Were they intended to "_wreck the constitution_".
as proposed by the left-wing or to prepare the ground for a
compromise with the British rulers? These questions were not
answered in the manifesto. The contents of the manifesto
were so vague that they could be interpreted in either way,
At the same time, it repeated the contents of the resolution
on civil rights adopted by the Karachi session of the Congress.
Besides, an appendix containing certain proposals for
the solution of the agrarian problems raised following the
emergence of the _Kisan Sabha_ was added to the manifesto.

In short, the Congress election manifesto contained an
approach which, while providing facilities to the leftists to
conduct propaganda in accordance with their own views,
was helpful to the right-wing to take an "appropriate decision"
after the elections with the support of the people attracted
by the leftist countenance of the manifesto.

Based on the manifesto, Jawaharlal Nehru conducted
a country-wide propaganda campaign in the capacity of
President of the Congress. The campaign was organized
on the model of the country-wide tours conducted by Gandhi
in 1921--22 and in the subsequent years. But unlike Gandhi,
Nehru endeavoured to spread the message of the left-oriented
_anti-imperialist_ front throughout the country. In the
tour Nehru proved that he was as good a crowd collector as
Gandhi was.

The election campaign tours also showed that in popularity
Nehru was next only to Gandhi. However, more important
was the change that had come about in the nature of
the Congress and the _anti-imperialist_ movement. The idea of
uncompromising struggles against imperialism as demanded
by Communists, Socialists and other leftists, the organizations
of workers, peasants and other working masses as an integral
part of these struggles. The Communist and Socialist ideologies
that helped and strengthened those who were working
in these organizations, and above all, the close link between
the Indian _freedom struggle_ and the revolutionary movements
all over the world --- all these were brought closer to
the masses by Nehru through his election campaign.

In the background, however, certain other developments
were taking place. The right-wing leadership which assigned
Nehru the work of writing an election manifesto capable of
inspiring millions of left minded youth and the working
masses as well as the task of conducting a country-wide
election campaign basing on the manifesto was striving to
win the elections by all means by reaching an electoral understanding
with the 'moderate' sections outside the Congress.

This was the approach which Nehru had sharply criticized
earlier. He accused the majority of Congress leaders
of moving in the direction of aligning with anyone and adopting
any method with the sole objective of winning the
elections. However, Nehru himself played later in the hands
of the right-wing in creating situations for gaining majority
and forming ministries at least in the non-Muslim majority
provinces. For instance, his biographer points out that:

>Within a few days he (Nehru) began negotiations with
Pandit Malaviya, whose outlook in politics was frankly
communal, for an electoral alliance with his _Nationalist
Party_.[^20/6]

[^20/6]: S. Gopal, _Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography_, Vol I, New Delhi, Orient Longman, 1976, pp. 208--209.

However compromising Nehru might have been with
the right-wing leaders at the high level, ordinary _Congressmen_,
_Congress Socialists_, Communists and other leftists were
striving at strengthening the left-oriented _anti-imperialist_ front
which found expression in the Lucknow session and in the
subsequent election campaign. The _Kisan Sabha_ had been
gaining strength day by day. In accordance with the decision
of the Lucknow Conference, Ist September was observed
as _All-India Kisan Day_ and a charter of demands was adopted
incorporating the immediate demands of the peasantry.
Many _Kisan jathas_ were led from different parts of Maharashtra
to Faizpur where the Congress was holding its fiftieth
session, demanding correction in the programme of the Congress
in the light of the charter of demands. Partly on account
of this, the Faizpur session adopted an agrarian programme
to be added to the election manifesto as an appendix.

Besides, working in trade unions and the _Kisan Sabha_,
efforts were also made by the leftists to organize a student
movement. It may be noted that the _All-India Students
Federation (AISF)_ was founded in the intervening period between
the Lucknow and Faizpur sessions of the Congress. It was
also in the same period that _people's struggles_ started to
emerge in the _Princely States_ against autocratic rule and for
_responsible governments_.

The Students Federation was founded on the initiative
taken by the leftist parties. Therefore, in the outlook as
well as in the policies and programmes of that organization
could be found the general _anti-imperialist_ views and also
the influence of Socialist and Communist ideologies. The situation
in the people's movements in the _Princely States_ was,
however, different. Along with Communists and Socialists,
Congress sympathizers and _bourgeois_ nationalists were also
taking part in these movements. However, like the mass
movements and organizations led by the leftists, this turned
out to be a challenge to the right-wing leaders including
Gandhi.

As we have seen earlier, because of the policy of "non-interference
in the internal affairs of the _Princely States_"
pursued by Gandhi and other right-wing Congress leaders,
the Congress had never come forward to actively support the
democratic struggles of the people in these states. The
leftists in the Congress were too weak to get this policy
reversed. However, in response to the developments that
began with the _Round Table Conferences_ and the reforms
proposals that emerged in the Conferences, a section of non-leftist
_bourgeois_ nationalists emerged in the _Princely States_.
Agitations for _responsible government_ were organized under
their leadership compelling even the _rightist_ _Congressmen_
to take part in them. These agitations gave rise to political
organizations of the subject people in the various _Princely
States_.

The leftists made significant contributions to the growth
of these new movements. The influence of the leftists in
Travancore, Cochin, Hyderabad and several other states
was undeniable. The political experience of many non-left
democrats in the course of the movements turned them to
the left. Even a large section of _bourgeois_ democrats who
thus turned to the left had to clash with the right-wing Congress
leadership at least on questions relating to the movements
in the _Princely States_.

Thus, it can be seen that while the right-wing Congress
leadership was engaged in the selection of candidates and
in other activities for winning the elections, the leftists
were utilizing the election campaign politically and organizationally
to further strengthen the _anti-imperialist_ mass
movement.

## THE FAIZPUR SESSION

In less than a year after the Lucknow session the next
session of the Congress was held in December 1936 in Faizpur,
an obscure village in Maharashtra.

Holding a Congress session in a rural area was contrary
to the tradition of the Congress since 1885 when it started
holding annual sessions regularly. The sessions held during
the past 16 years during which the Congress led directly by
Gandhi was considered an organization identified with the
peasant masses were no exception. For the first time the
Congress was now holding its session in a backward village
with entirely rural amenities.

The Faizpur session was noteworthy in another respect
also. For the first time, again, a person, particularly one
who was known to hold differences with the majority in the
leadership, was presiding over the session for a second time
in succession. Jawaharlal Nehru who had declared himself
in the previous Lucknow presidential address to be holding
views that were different from those of Gandhi and other
right-wing leaders presided over the Faizpur session.

In a sense this was an indication to the growing influence
of the left forces in the Congress. But the election of
Nehru to the presidentship was not the result of a leftist
victory over the right-wing; rather, the election took place
in a manner which showed that the differences between the
two wings in the organization were becoming sharper. As
with the earlier Lahore and Lucknow sessions, Nehru's name
was proposed for the presidentship for the Faizpur session by
Gandhi and other right-wing leaders. As soon as the decision
of the leadership was announced, Nehru issued a statement
saying:

>I shall welcome the election of any of my colleagues
and co-operate with him in another capacity in the great
enterprise we have undertaken. Should, however, the choice
of my countrymen fall on me, I dare not say 'no' to it.
I shall submit to their pleasure. But before they so decide
they must realise fully what I stand for, what thoughts move
me, what the springs of actions are for me in speech and
writing. I have given enough indication of this and from
this I wanted to be judged.[^20/7]

[^20/7]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _op. cit_, pp. 31--32.

Vallabhbhai Patel was nominated to the presidentship
as the representative of the right-wing. Withdrawing from
the contest Patel said in a statement:

>My withdrawal should not be taken to mean that I endorse
all the views Jawaharlalji stands for. Indeed, _Congressmen_
know that on some vital matters my views are in conflict
with those held by Jawaharlalji.[^20/8]

[^20/8]: _Ibid_, p. 32.

The statement added:

>The question of 'holding office' is not a live issue today.
But I can visualise an occasion when acceptance of office
may be desirable to achieve the common purpose. There
may then be a sharp division of opinion between Jawaharlalji
and myself or rather among _Congressmen_. We
know Jawaharlalji to be too loyal to the Congress to disregard
the decision of the majority, assuming that the
latter lays down a policy repugnant to him. ... The Congress
President has no dictatorial powers. He is the chairman
of our well-built organization. He regulates the proceedings
and carries out the decisions of the Congress as they
may be arrived from time to time. The Congress does
not part with its ample powers by electing any individual
no matter who he is.[^20/9]

[^20/9]: _Ibid_, p. 32.

That is, Patel's statement withdrawing his own candidature
was a clear indication to the fact that the right-wing
leadership had already gained enough confidence of "taming"
Nehru. As we have shown earlier, Nehru acted after the
Luck now session in a manner helpful to this. Rajagopalachari
in a letter to Gandhi stated that he was "charmed" by this
change in Nehru. Patel also spoke highly of Nehru in a
letter to Gandhi. He stated:

>We found not the slightest
difficulty in cooperating with him and adjusting ourselves
to his views on certain points. I have an impression that
he is also satisfied.

Quoting these two letters, Nehru's
biographer states:

>Whether, as claimed, Jawaharlal was equally satisfied is
doubtful. But he made no public grievance of the clipping
of his wings. If he realized that, though he was president,
he was being steadily forced to continue the retreat which
had begun at Lucknow, he did not disclose it even to his
closest friends and threw all his energies into the winning
of the elections.[^20/10]

[^20/10]: S. Gopal, _op. cit_ p. 215.

In any case, in Nehru's rejoinder to Patel's statement
he had assured that he would strive to loyally implement
the Congress decisions whatever his own opinion on them.
He agreed that his re-nomination to the Congress presidentship
was not a recognition to his ideologies, but that it was
a general recognition to his actions as president of the Congress
for the past eight months. He reiterated that irrespective
of whether he was elected to the presidentship or not,
he would loyally abide by the decisions of the Congress.

In short, the strategy of the right-wing to "tame" him
to the presidency had been successful. As desired by Gandhi
and other right-wing Congress leaders as well as by Birla
and other capitalists, they had got a Congress president now
who would be ready to loyally implement even a decision to
accept office that the Congress might take in the future. On the
other side, his presidency would attract the left-minded youth
and the labouring masses to the Congress. What we find
in the statement of Patel is the self-confidence arising out of
this calculation. In other words, what was indicated at the
Faizpur session was not merely the surge of the left forces
as thought of by many, but also the skillful tactics of the
right-wing leadership of maximally utilizing the advancing
left forces to serve its own class interests.

It must be noted that all these developments took place
at a time when the left movement in general and the Socialist-Communist
forces in particular were able to make significant
advances. Explaining the background of the Faizpur session,
the official historian of the Congress, Pattabhi Sitaramayya,
has dealt at length with the new constitution adopted by
the Soviet Union a month before the Faizpur session:

>It was on the 25th November 1936 just a month prior to
the Faizpur session of the Congress that in the great Kremlin
Palace 2040 delegates gathered to discuss and adopt
the New Constitution of the USSR. It was the embodiment
of, even as it was the testimony to, the economic
and political, the cultural and social progress achieved,
particularly during the previous twelve years. In one bound,
what was purely an agricultural State in the world was
transformed into one of the most advanced powers of the
world where industries flourished commensurately with
agriculture, organized according to modern technique. The
New Constitution introduced a new era and a new organisation
of the State.[^20/11]

[^20/11]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _op. cit_, p. 29.

Sitaramayya added that it was no wonder that at Faizpur
the atmosphere was surcharged with Socialist slogans, emphasizing
the rights of workers and peasants on the one hand
and declaiming against the forces of imperialism and fascism
on the other. As an evidence to this he cites the resolution
introduced by the _Congress Socialist Party_ at the _Subjects
Committee_ which stated that:

>the Congress declares the
solidarity of Indian people with the enslaved peoples of the
world, whether the colonial or the so-called 'Sovereign' States
and with the people of USSR.

Apart from introducing this resolution, the Socialists,
Communists and other left-wing sections also used the
conference venue for free political activities. The organization
of the _Kisan jatha_ which was mentioned earlier was part of
these activities. The _jatha_ was received by the Congress
president Nehru and the Chairman of the _Reception Committee_,
Shankar Rao Deo when it reached the conference
venue. Greeting the members of the _jatha_ on behalf of the
Congress, Nehru congratulated them for the work they did
in the villages along their way.

Presiding over the _Kisan Conference_, NG Ranga
felicitated Nehru on behalf of the _Kisan Congress_ and
on his own behalf for his election to the Congress presidentship
for a second term. Expressing satisfaction on the
performance of Nehru, Ranga hoped that he would introduce
the necessary provisions to give representation to the
_kisans_ in all the elected bodies of the Congress.

Conferences and committee meetings of the _Congress
Socialist Party_ and many other _anti-imperialist_ organizations
were also held in the venue of the Faizpur session. The
conference provided opportunities for the different groups
and organizations of leftists to exchange views among themselves
and to propagate the views of these groups and
organization among the Congress delegates. As was the case
with the Lucknow session, the activities carried out outside
the Congress session were broader and more successful than
the resolutions adopted formally in the Congress session.
However, what attracted the attention of the people inside
and outside the session was the spirited debates that took
place on the platform of the session. And these debates
were centred round the questions of election and the future
course of action.

As was the case in the Lucknow session, the right-wing
Congress leaders were not prepared to take a clear and
final decision on the question of office acceptance. In view
of their objectives, taking a decision in favour of office
acceptance in the prevailing situation was inopportune. If
they took a decision against office acceptance as demanded
by the leftists, it would be impossible for them to change
the decision later. Besides, at a time when it was necessary
to earn the support of a majority of the voters by inspiring
the entire people through a massive propaganda against
the constitution, it would be unwise to divide the Congress
by taking a decision either in favour of or against office
acceptance. A decision on the question of office acceptance
at that stage would create problems in starting negotiations
with the British authorities even after securing a majority
in the elections on the same question. These were the considerations
that motivated the leadership to defer the decision
once again.

As noted earlier, the demand for constituting a _Constituent
Assembly_ by Indians themselves was part of the agitations
against the _constitutional reforms_ proposed by the British.
How such a _Constituent Assembly_ would be formed, what
were the conditions necessary for its formation and how
these conditions would be brought into force --- these questions
came up for lively discussions in which the right and
left wings came to clash with each other. Finally, the conference
decided under the pressure of the right-wing leadership
to hold a convention comprising the members elected to the
Central and provincial legislatures, members of the _AICC_
and others who might be invited by the _Congress Working
Committee_ and constitute a constitution making body.

This was a move made by the right-wing leadership to
get their policy relating to the _Constituent Assembly_ accepted
by the Congress as was the case with the question of acceptance
of office. It was their intention to reduce the _Constituent
Assembly_ into a convention and destroy its revolutionary
character.

In sum, as in the case of the Lucknow session, the
Faizpur session ended in a manner in which the right-wing
leadership could claim victory. However, the activities
conducted by the leftists outside the conference _pantal_ and
the propaganda carried out inside the _pantal_ stood witness to
the advance and the organized character of the leftists. The
_Kisan_ rally organized by the re-organized _Communist Party_
which had been in a state of disorganization until the last
three years, the _Congress Socialist Party_ which was formed
just two years ago and other left forces was an indication to
the growing strength of the left. Although Nehru had been
"tamed" according to the deliberate plans of the right-wing
leadership, the leftist movement claimed to be represented
by Nehru was surging ahead without being amenable to be
tamed or destroyed.

A related event was the appearance of MN Roy in public.
Roy who had reached India through illegal means after being
expelled from the _Communist International_ and formed what
was called the "_Royist Group_" was subsequently arrested and
had been released just before the Faizpur session after a
long period of imprisonment. He was naturally recognized
as one of the leaders of the left. Nehru in his presidential
address had extended welcome to Roy. He was one of the
leaders who were present to receive the _Kisan jatha_.

However, right in the Faizpur session Roy had started
taking an attitude of leaving the left camp and helping the
right-wing leadership directly or indirectly. It may be recalled
that Roy had argued that the Indian _bourgeoisie_ had completely
fallen in line with the reactionary forces in contra-distinction
to the Marxist analysis made by Lenin in the
_Communist International_. As a result of the re-thinking he
had done after reaching India following his expulsion from
the _Communist International_, Roy had begun to transform
himself as the founder leader of a new "radical movement"
within the framework of the _bourgeois_ leadership, giving up
the idea of independent leadership of the working class.
Although this change in him had not taken its full form in
the Faizpur session, its beginning could have been discerned
at that stage.

## THE ELECTIONS AND AFTER

In accordance with the provisions of the _Reforms Act_
of 1935, elections to the provincial legislatures were held a
few weeks after the Faizpur session. The elections were
politically significant in many respects. It was for the first
time in the political history of India that such a massive
electorate was participating in an election. anyone who paid
a certain minimum amount to the government as tax or one
who was a literate had now the right to vote. The names of
about 35 million voters satisfying these qualifications would
appear on the electoral list.

Besides, any party winning a majority of seats could
form a government at the provincial level and carry on
administration on a wide range of subjects. In other words,
an unprecedentedly large section of the population had now
obtained the right and opportunity to decide who or which
party should handle the administrative machinery in the near
future, although the administration was confined to the
province. Both the right and the left-wings in the Congress
had been striving, from their respective stand-points, to
strengthen the _anti-imperialist_ movement making use of this
right and opportunity.

At the same time, the new constitution was one of
placing obstructions before the _anti-imperialists_ striving to
win the objective of expelling the British from power and
establishing people's governments at all levels. Even in the
provincial sector in which powers had been transferred to
people's representatives, special powers were vested in the
Governor. At the Centre, the hold of the British authorities
remained as before and provisions had been made in the
new constitution which were suited to serve this purpose.

In the circumstances, the Congress and other _anti-imperialist_
organizations were participating in the elections
to the provincial legislatures not to "bring into force creatively"
the provisions of provincial autonomy contained in the
constitution, but to "combat" and destroy the whole constitution,
particularly the federal system contained in it. That is,
the _anti-imperialists_ including the Congress were conducting
the election campaign as part of the activities to rally the
masses on a wide scale in the struggle to reject the very
constitution based on which the elections were being held.

As distinct from this, certain parties and organizations
adopting a "creative" approach towards at least the provisions
of provincial autonomy in the constitution appeared on
the election scene. The _Justice Party_ in the province of
Madras, the _Independent Labour Party_ led by B. R. Ambedkar
in Bombay and Central Provinces, the _National Agricultural
Party_ of _Zamindars_ and landlords in UP, its
counterpart in Punjab, called the _Unionist Party_ and the
_Krishak Praja Party_ led by Fazlul Huq in Bengal were prominent
among such parties. These were in addition to the
communal parties like the _Hindu Mahasabha_ and the _Muslim
League_.

The British rulers came forward to encourage and assist
each of these parties and individuals not affiliated to any of
them. Thus, the candidates of these and similar other parties
and groups as well as independents entered the election field
opposing the candidates of the _anti-imperialist_ front represented
by the Congress and other _anti-imperialist_ organizations,
although the latter were not contesting the elections
under a unified leadership or based on a common programme
acceptable to them.

The question of the approach towards the constitution
prepared by the British government became a lively issue
before the 35 million strong electorate. The election became
a platform of conflict between two large camps: one comprising
all the _anti-imperialist_ forces which, though divided
between the left and the right-wings, were fighting against
the constitution and striving to draw the entire people in that
fight, and the other made up of the different political groups
which, though based on different programmes, were opposed
to the _anti-imperialist_ front and for that reason receiving the
overt and covert assistance from the British rulers. In the election
battle between these two camps the British authorities
took certain actions against the _anti-imperialist_ camp and in
favour of the camp which was opposed to it. Even while the
election campaigns were in progress thousands of prisoners,
including the _Congress Working Committee_ member, Subhas
Bose, were languishing in the prisons all over the country.
Although Abdul Gaffar Khan was set free, he was externed
from his home province. The _anti-imperialist_ camp had to
face all these obstructions and other kinds of repressive
actions by the government in conducting the election campaign.

Nevertheless, the Congress secured an absolute majority
in five provinces, Madras, the United Provinces, the
Central Provinces, Bihar and Orissa. In Bombay, it reached
very close to a majority and in Bengal, Assam and NWF
Province it became the biggest single party in the legislatures.
Only in Punjab and Sind did the Congress turn up as a
minority party. The total number of seats in all the 11 provinces
was 1585 out of which the Congress won 715 seats.
It must be specifically stated that the Congress contested
mainly in the general seats. The total number of seats reserved
for Muslims in the assemblies was 482. The Congress
contested 58 seats and won 26. Similarly, the Congress
contested 20 seats out of a total number of 38 reserved for
labour and won 18 seats. The total number of seats reserved
for landholders was 37 out of which it contested 8 seats and
won 4. Of the total number of 56 seats reserved for industries
and commerce, the Congress contested 8 seats and won 3.

It can be seen that the Congress victory was confined
largely to the general constituencies and that its performance
in the reserved constituencies was rather poor. It contested
only a few seats in the reserved constituencies and won still
a lesser number of seats. But, it is worth noticing that among the
reserved constituencies, only in the constituencies reserved
for labour the Congress was able to contest and win a comparatively
higher number of seats.

It is also significant to note that there was not one single
political party to contest seats reserved for Muslims comparable
in proportion to the number of seats the Congress
had contested in the general constituencies. The _Muslim
League_ contested only 123 seats out of a total number of 482
seats reserved for Muslims. A majority of Muslim seats
were shared by the _Unionist Party_ in Punjab and the _Krishak
Praja Party_ in Bengal and by unattached independents.

The elections to the provincial legislatures in 1937 in a
way reflected, in general, the political situation prevailing then
in India. The victory of the Congress in the general constituencies
on one side and its defeat in the constituencies reserved
for religious minorities, including the Muslims, the
depressed and backward communities and for other 'special
interests', but a stronger support in the seats reserved for
labour on the other --- this was the picture that emerged. At
the same time, there was no political organization to challenge
the Congress at the all-India level.

As soon as the elections were over, the question on the
future course of action arose before the Congress. An important
aspect of this question was office acceptance. Questions
also arose as to what the elected Congress members should
do inside and outside the legislatures and how should they
behave and with what perspective. These and several other
problems of similar nature had to be resolved. Needless to
say, on each such problem the left and the right clashed
with each other. Finally, the _Congress Working Committee_
held at Wardha in February-March 1937 adopted a resolution,
the major features of which are as follows.

1. The Congress has entered the legislatures not to
cooperate with the new constitution or the government but
to combat the Act and the policy underlying it. The Congress
adheres to its general and basic policy of _non-cooperation_
with the apparatus of British imperialism except insofar as
circumstances may require a variation.
2. The objective of the Congress is _Purna Swaraj_ and
to that end all its activities are directed. The Congress
stands for a genuine democratic state and such a state can
only be created by the Indian people themselves through a
_constituent assembly_ elected by adult franchise, which can
only come into existence when the Indian people have
developed sufficient power and sanctions to shape their destiny
without external interference.
3. The immediate objective of the Congress in the
legislatures is to fight the new constitution --- particularly the
federal part of it --- and to lay stress on the nations demand
for a _constituent assembly_. Congress members have been
directed to take the earliest opportunity to put forward in
the new Assemblies this demand for a _Constituent Assembly_,
and to support it by mass agitation outside.
4. The Congress policy is not of assisting or cooperating
with any function or activity, calculated to enhance the
power or prestige of British imperialism in India. Ceremonial,
official or social functions of this kind must therefore
be avoided and no Congress member should take part in
them.
5. No Congress member of the legislatures may accept
a title given by the British Government.
6. The Congress Party in each provincial Assembly
must act as a disciplined body. Individual members shall
have no official contacts with Government other than those
resulting from their duties as members, and such as may be
expressly authorized by the Party,
7. Congress members should press for the carrying
out of the Congress programme as enunciated in the election
manifesto and the Congress agrarian resolution. In particular,
they should work for:

i) A substantial reduction in rent and revenue.
ii) Assessment of income-tax, on a progressive scale,
on agricultural incomes, subject to a prescribed
minimum.
iii) Fixity of tenure.
iv) Relief from the burden of rural debt and arrears
of rent and revenue.
v) Repeal of all repressive laws.
vi) Release of political prisoners, internees and detenues.
vii) Restoration of lands and property confiscated or
sold by government during _civil disobedience_
movements.
viii) Eight hours day for industrial workers, without
reduction of pay, living wage.
ix) Prohibition of intoxicating liquor and drugs.
x) Unemployment relief.
xi) Reduction of high salaries, allowances, and cost of
administration of government.

Congress members elected to the provincial legislature
were also directed to give expression to certain important
demands of all India application, such as substantial reduction
of the military expenditure as well as of the higher civil
services, complete national control over trade and tariffs and
currency, repeal of all repressive legislation, freedom of
speech, press and association, and opposition to war preparations,
credit and loans.[^20/12]

Doubts arose regarding the propriety of taking the _Oath
of Allegiance_ to the British rulers by members elected to the
legislatures before assuming office. It was feared that taking
such an oath would go counter to the objective of _Purna
Swaraj_. The _working committee_ declared that "the taking of
that oath, in order to enable participation in the work of the
legislatures, in no way lessens or varies the demand for independence".
However, it was also decided that before taking
that oath, the members elected should take a pledge declaring
allegiance to the Indian people. The all-India convention held
on 19th and 20th March 1937 was utilized to take the pledge
which stated as follows.

>I, a member of this All India Convention convened by the
_Indian National Congress_, pledge myself to the service of
India and to work in the legislatures and outside for the
Independence of India and the ending of the exploitation
and poverty of our people. I pledge myself to work under
the discipline of the Congress for the furtherance of
Congress ideals and objectives to the end that India may
be free and independent and her millions freed from the
heavy burdens they suffer from.[^20/13]

## CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF MINISTRIES

The _Congress Working Committee_ which met on 17--18th
March 1937, immediately before the Convention referred
to above, finally took a decision on the controversial question
of office acceptance.

The _Working Committee_ decided not reject office as
demanded by the left-wing. The Committee was also against
acceptance of office just because the Congress commanded a
majority in a number of provinces, as argued by the right-wing
leaders. It wanted to be satisfied that "the Governor
would not use his special powers of interference or set aside
the advice of ministers in regard to constitutional activities".
In the absence of such an assurance from the rulers, the
Congress would not accept office and if it obtained the
assurance, it would accept office. The justification for this
policy, in the words of the official historian of the Congress,
is as follows.

>In six out of eleven provinces, the party that came in a
majority would not touch office with a pair of tongs nor
would it keep its hands wholly off the business. If the
Congress annihilated itself as a parliamentary limb of the
nation, the Government knew what to do. If the Congress
on the contrary assumed office, the Government would soon
adjust themselves to their new environment, for the bureaucracy
is an expert in the art of adjusting itself to the
changing conditions and biding it's time for an opportunity
to overthrow them. The Congress would not let Government
play their game according to their wonted lines.[^20/14]

[^20/14]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _op. cit_, p. 45.

Earlier, we had dealt at length with the attitude of the
Congress, the 'moderates' and the caste-communal politicians
towards the new constitution. The federal system with regard
to the central government was equally unacceptable to all of
them. As with the provincial administration, the constitutional
provisions might be acceptable to them, provided the special
powers vested in the Governor were removed.

The Congress was now trying to get the special powers
vested in the Governor freezed at the provincial level, while
rejecting the federal system at the Centre. Such a policy
was well suited to the needs of the _bourgeois_ politicians outside
the Congress. However, the _bourgeois_ parties were not
prepared to organize struggles against the Federation at the
Centre and to refuse to form ministries at least temporarily
in the provinces in order to get the special powers of the
Governor freezed. The Congress was ready to rally the
people against the Federation and to keep away from forming
ministries at the provincial level until a clear assurance was
obtained from the British with regard to the special powers
vested in the Governor. The Congress, in fact, maintained
that position for three months even in the provinces in which
it commanded a majority in the legislature. Such a situation
never existed before or after it in Indian politics.

It was relatively easy to take this decision rather than
implementing it. None of the Governors, nor the Viceroy
nor the British Government was prepared to give such an
assurance as demanded by the Congress. They maintained
that giving an assurance against the exercise of powers vested
in accordance with the provisions of the constitution was
"unconstitutional". Not only the British authorities, but even
the 'moderates' like Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru took this attitude.
On the contrary, many Indians who were known to be constitutional
experts maintained that the attitude of the Congress
was correct both politically and constitutionally. A.B Kieths,
the top constitutional expert in England, concurred with this
view.

However, rather than remaining confined within the
narrow circles of constitutional experts and politicians as a
point of debate, it became a live political issue with the
people. A country-wide _hartal_ was observed on 1st April,
the day on which the provisions with regard to provincial
autonomy in the new constitution came into force. On that
day millions of people were rallied behind the proposal put
forward by the Congress to reject the British made constitution
and to constitute a _constituent assembly_ to frame a constitution
of the Indian people. Not only the Congress committees
and activists, but also trade unions and other mass
organizations and the Communist and Socialist parties actively
participated in the _hartal_ and demonstrations. These
demonstrations naturally provided support to the Congress
stipulation for forming ministries.

But both the British authorities and the right-wing
Congress leadership equally dreaded the continuance of this
struggle with the direct participation of the people. Although
'interim' minority governments were formed by other parties
where the Congress had kept itself away, the British rulers
knew that these governments had no popular backing. Those
who joined these 'governments' were known as _imperialist agents_
and were hated by a vast majority of the people. From the
past experience the authorities had learnt that if such a situation
was allowed to continue, people would resort to fierce
struggles which they would not be able to put down even by
repressive measures.

The right-wing Congress leaders, on the other hand,
could not even think of overthrowing the British rule through
a mass revolution and establishing a state of the Indian
people. Whenever mass struggles broke out, they stood in
the forefront claiming themselves to be the leaders of these
struggles and utilizing that position to bargain with the rulers.
This had been their tactics. Precisely for the same reason,
they could accept neither the anti-struggle approach of the
'moderates' nor the leftist approach of leading militant
mass struggles along revolutionary paths. They wanted to
strive for a compromise with the rulers by standing in the
forefront of the struggles. This was what happened, in fact, in 1920--21 and 1930--31 and the same was being repeated in 1937.
Unlike the 'moderates' and the caste-communal politicians,
the right-wing Congress leaders were not ready to form ministries
"strictly in accordance with the constitution" as soon
as they obtained a majority in the legislatures. At the same
time, they were frightened by the waves of _people's struggles_
that might naturally arise out of the political uncertainty
following the refusal to form the ministries. They indisputably
wanted to avoid such a situation.

It was in this circumstance that Gandhi and other right-wing
Congress leaders together with the legal experts supporting
their views entered into a controversy with the British
authorities and their legal experts on the "legal validity of
demanding assurance" with regard to the exercise of special
powers vested in Governor. Although in form the controversy
was legal as it related to the interpretation of the constitution,
in content it was political. The crux of the issue was whether
the people's representatives (the _bourgeoisie_ and its companions)
should be able to run the administration, though
within the framework of limited provincial autonomy, without
interference from the Governor. Although both sides
displayed extreme rigidity in presenting their arguments,
they had a desire to reach a settlement. Both adopted a
tone, language and arguments which were helpful to avoid a
clash and to facilitate a settlement.

Since neither side was in a position to backslide, the
resulting deadlock continued for three months. During this
period "interim" governments were in power in the Congress
majority provinces. The popular feelings rose high against them
and their British supporters, and the Communists, Socialists
and other leftists tried to give these feelings an organized
form of _anti-imperialist_ struggle. In the 'war of statements'
between the British and the Congress in this period, each stage
turned out to be a step towards a compromise. Finally, on 21st June the Viceroy made a statement which helped to end
the deadlock.

The Viceroy's statement may be summarized as follows.
There need be no fear that the Governors would take steps
over the heads of the popular ministers, whatever be the
wordings in the constitution. The experience of the _non-Congress_
ministries, majority as well as minority, bears
witness to this. Even assuming that doubts and distrust
expressed by the Congress are honest, it can feel assured
that the Governors will not unnecessarily interfere in the
day-to-day functioning of the ministers and that there will
be no hindrance to their carrying on the rule in accordance
with their policies.

Did this constitute the assurance the Congress had
sought? The right-wing leadership (_Working Committee_) said
it did. Because, the Viceroy, while admitting the probability
of the Governor dismissing the ministry in extraordinary
circumstances or the ministry resigning, had clarified that
the Governor would not interfere in the day to-day functioning
of the ministry. Once this approach was adopted, its
practice depended mainly on the personal relation between
the Governor and the ministers. The moment this relation
was vitiated, the ministry could resign. If there was a
difference of opinion between the Governor and the ministry
which might not be too crucial to warrant its resignation, the
ministers had the right to place it before the people. Therefore,
the _Working Committee_ which met in the first week of
July 1937 resolved that "_Congressmen_ be permitted to accept
office where they may be invited thereto. But it desires to
make it clear that office is to be accepted and utilised for
the purpose of working in accordance with lines laid down
in the Congress election manifesto and to further in every
possible way the Congress policy of combating the new Act
on the one hand and of prosecuting the _constructive programmes_
on the other."

The _Working Committee_ was of the view that though
the assurance demanded by the _AICC_ in March was not
there in the literal sense, its essence was contained in the
official statement. So, the Committee took the decision without
calling another meeting of the _AICC_ to ratify it, since
it considered that any further delay in taking a decision
would be detrimental to the interests of the nation.

It may be recalled that Nehru who was the president of
the Congress when the _Working Committee_ took this decision
had been opposed to the approach contained in the resolution
of the Committee. Besides him, there were many others
among the leaders and ordinary _Congressmen_ who were
similarly opposed to office acceptance. Yet they were prepared
to implement the decision, since the minority had to
abide by the majority decision. Accordingly, Congress ministries
were formed not only in five provinces where it had
commanded a majority but also in Bombay and the NWF
Province with the help of certain others. After a few months
Congress ministries were formed in Sind and Assam also with
the help of certain other groups. Thus, the Congress trans--
formed itself into a ruling party at the provincial level.
