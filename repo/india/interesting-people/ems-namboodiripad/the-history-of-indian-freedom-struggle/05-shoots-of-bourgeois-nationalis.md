# SHOOTS OF _BOURGEOIS_ NATIONALISM

## UNITY OF INDIA: THE MAIN CONDITION

We have already noticed that one of the important factors
that enabled the British to suppress the _Sepoy Mutiny_
and the _people's revolt_ of 1857--59 was the disunity among
Indians. Whenever a section of the people rose against the
foreign rule, the British suppressed the revolt with the help
and assistance of various other sections. Ultimately, when
the people of Delhi and the surrounding areas started a far
more widespread revolt, it was suppressed with the help and
assistance of not only the Punjabis, Marathis and Nepalis in
the neighbouring areas, but also sections of people in the
very same areas where the revolt was going on.

This disunity among the Indian people was the product of
the inherent character of the Indian society which had been
divided among mutually opposing classes in the form of
_varnas_ and castes that emerged after the break-up of the
ancient tribal society.

Unlike the European societies, the Indian class society
did not reach the stage of national unity, a special product
of _Capitalism_, after going through the historical stages of
social development of _slavery_, _feudalism_, and _Capitalism_
following the break-up of the primitive tribal society. What
prevailed in India for centuries was a social system based
first on _chaturvarnya_ and, later, on the caste system which hid
behind it the class divisions characteristic of _slavery_ and
_feudalism_, and economic exploitation and political oppression
arising out of them.

Consequently, when certain social forces of _Capitalism_
began to emerge in the caste-based society, the existing
social background was not conducive for the development of
these forces. The continued existence of a society for generations
without appreciable change, divided not only among
castes and religions, but also among tribes in some places,
with growing contradictions and relations of hierarchy among
them, and a system of self-sufficient village communities
based on the social relations arising out of these institutions --- this
is the essence of India's past history. In the words of
Marx:

>However, changing the political aspect of India's past
might appear, its social condition has remained unaltered
since its remotest antiquity, until the first decennial of the 19th century. The handloom and the spinning wheel,
producing their regular myriads of spinners and weavers,
were the pivots of the structure of that society. From
immemorial times, Europe received the admirable textures
of Indian labour, sending in return for them her precious
metals and furnishing thereby his material to the goldsmith,
that indispensable member of Indian society, whose
love of finery is so great that even the lowest class, those
who go about nearly naked, have commonly a pair of
golden ear-rings and a gold ornament of some kind hung
round their necks. ... It was the British intruder who broke
up the Indian handloom and destroyed the spinning wheel.
England began with driving the Indian cotton from the
European market; it then introduced twist into Hindustan
and in the end inundated the very mother country of cotton
with cottons.[^05/1]

[^05/1]: _The First Indian War of Independence_, pp. 17--18.

The disastrous changes this has brought to Indian society
have been described in an earlier chapter. The people's
rebellions that ended with the 1857--59 revolt were the consequence
of these changes. For the same reason, when the
rebellions were suppressed, this disastrous process not only
continued but got strengthened. Although the rebellionists
were suppressed, the political backgrounds that led to those
revolts, _i.e._, the discontent of the pauperized masses, still
continued with intensity.

Along with this, a new background began to develop
capable of giving expression to the growing mass discontent
in forms other than the form of the 1857--59 struggles. The
institutions of caste and the more or less self-sufficient villages
were undermined. Objective conditions began to develop
for politically unifying Indian people who hitherto remained
divided among the different castes, religions and tribes and for
transforming them into a unified nation. As part of the process
of the destruction of the rural society based on handloom and
hand-spinning, the foundation of the caste system and of
the society based on it began to crack.

A new consciousness began to spread among the Indian
people that they, like the European nationalities which were
being united more and more as an inevitable result of the
development of _Capitalism_, also constituted themselves a
nationality. Also, material conditions began to emerge for
the formation of a national independence movement as distinct
from that of the 1857--59 period.

Marx observed that the British had "to fulfil a double
mission in India: one destructive, the other regenerating --- the
annihilation of old Asiatic society and the laying of the
material foundations of Western Society in Asia", because
it was the same British domination which caused disaster to
Indian society that caused these material conditions to rise.
The British rule established here was, in fact, fulfilling both
these missions. It was by giving paramount importance to
"political unity of India" in this "regeneration" that Marx
presented his conclusions on the "future results of the British
rule in India". Marx wrote:

>The political unity of India, more
consolidated, and extending farther than it did under the
Great Moguls, was the first condition of its regeneration.[^05/2]

How did this "political unity" come about under the British
rule ? Marx says:

>That unity, imposed by the British sword, will now
be strengthened and perpetuated by the electric telegraph.
The native army organised and trained by the
British drill-sergeant, was the _sine qua non_ of Indian self-emancipation
and of India ceasing to be the prey of the
first foreign intruder. The free press, introduced for the
first time into Asiatic society, and managed principally by
the common offspring of Hindus and Europeans, is a new
and powerful agent of reconstruction. The _zamindari_ and
_ryotwari_ themselves, abominable as they are, involve two
distinct forms of private property in land --- the great desideratum
of Asiatic society. From the Indian natives, reluctantly
and sparingly educated at Calcutta, under English
superintendence, a fresh class is springing up, endowed with
the requirements for government, and imbued with European
science. Steam has brought India into regular and
rapid communication with Europe, has connected its chief
ports with those of the whole south-eastern ocean, and has
revindicated it from the isolated position which was the
prime law of its stagnation. The day is not far distant when,
by a combination of railways and steam vessels the distance
between England and India, measured by time, will be
shortened to eight days and when that once fabulous
country will thus be actually annexed to the Western
world.[^05/3]

[^05/2]: _Ibid_, p. 34.

[^05/3]: _Ibid_, pp. 34--35.

Marx gave a preeminent role to the construction of
railways in fulfilling the mission of "regeneration" by the
British in India. Marx saw in the introduction of railways a
step that would help bring about a total change in the traditional
image of India:

>It is notorious that the productive powers of India are
paralyzed by the utter want of means of conveying and
exchanging its various produce. Nowhere, more than in
India, do we meet with social destitution in the midst of
natural plenty for want of means of exchange. ... The introduction
of railroads may be easily made to subserve
agricultural purposes by the formation of tanks where
ground is required for embankment and by the conveyance
of water along different lines. Thus irrigation, the _sine qua
non_ of farming in the East, might be greatly extended and
the frequently recurring local famines, arising from the
want of water, would be averted.[^05/4]

[^05/4]: _Ibid_, pp. 35--36.

The importance of railways does not end with this. It
is the beginning of the process which Marx characterizes as
the "laying of the material foundations of Western society".
Marx continues:

>I know that the English millocracy intend to endow
India with railways with the exclusive view of extracting
at diminished expenses cotton and other raw
materials for their manufacturers. But when you have once
introduced machinery into the locomotion of a country,
which possesses iron and coals, you are unable to withold it
from its fabrication. You cannot maintain a net of railways
over an immense country without introducing all those industrial
processes necessary to meet the immediate and current
wants of railway locomotion and out of which there must
grow the application of machinery to those branches of
industry not immediately connected with railways. The
railway system will therefore become, in India, truly the
forerunner of modern industry. This is the more certain as
the Hinds are allowed by British authorities themselves to
possess particular aptitude for accommodating themselves
to entirely new labour and acquiring the requisite knowledge
of machinery. ... Modern industry resulting from the
railway system will dissolve the hereditary divisions of
labour upon which rest the Indian castes, those decisive
impediments to Indian progress and Indian power.[^05/5]

[^05/5]: _Ibid_, pp. 37--38.

The British engaged themselves in these "regeneration"
activities, not as propagated by the British rulers and their
sycophants, for modernizing in India. In Marx's words:

>The millocracy have discovered that the transformation of
India into a reproductive country has become of vital importance
to them, and that, to that end, it is necessary, above
all, to gift her with means of irrigation and of internal
communication. They intend now drawing a net of railroads
over India. And they will do it.[^05/6]

[^05/6]: _Ibid_, p. 35.

But whatever might have been the real intentions of
British rulers, this fostered the material conditions for the
emergence of an organized _people's struggle_. The result was
that it provided the capability to the Indian people to build
a new movement that could not be suppressed by force as it
was the _people's revolts_ that culminated in the 1857--59 revolt.
Unconsciously though, the British united the Indian people
politically, by destroying the caste-based beliefs and practices
and the decadent social life that had been preventing the people
from launching and participating in such a _people's struggle_
and also fostered in them the intense urge for independence.
This was the other side of the mission of "destruction"
of the British.

The British rule also began the process of the birth of
a class --- the _bourgeoisie_ --- as distinct from the feudal aristocracy,
and its co-born antagonistic class force --- the working
class --- to stand in forefront of the people surging towards a
unified _freedom struggle_.

It would not have been possible for the British to consolidate
their political administrative system or to perpetuate
their economic exploitation of India without creating
the material conditions for the creation of a state with jurisdiction
all over the country but above the _varna_-caste system,
and for the emergence and development of new classes and
strata with _bourgeois_ characteristics, under it.

Classes and strata of people capable of giving leadership
to a new type of independence struggle had already begun
to emerge in various parts of India even before 1857--59. The
most significant manifestation of this was witnessed in Bengal
where the British rule had first struck roots. In fact, it was
this section of people who played a key role in organizing the
masses against the 1857--59 revolt characterizing it "reactionary".
For the same reason, the assurances given by the British in 1859 in the form of Queen Victoria's Proclamation, etc., to
maintain and protect all the traditional beliefs, customs and
practices based on caste, naturally disturbed this section of the
people. Furthermore, the steps subsequently taken by the
British rulers also created disillusionment among these people
who had hoped that the rulers would take their stand in their
favour to maintain and protect the moral values that they
had cherished most, as also their economic and political
ideologies.

Thus, the very same sections of people who had earlier
stood alongside the British against the rebellion, began to
give shape to a new _anti-British_ movement, step by step.

Which were these sections and how did they come to be
formed and developed; how did the organized _bourgeois_
national movement come to be formed as a result of this
development; how did the working class become an independent
political force against the _bourgeois_ leadership of the
movement, though an integral part of it? -- these are the
main questions that relate to the next stage in the history of
the _freedom struggle_.

## LANDED ARISTOCRACY: OLD AND NEW

We had cited more than once in the earlier pages the
opinion of Marx that the British had really brought a revolution
in the landownership system in India. This played a
significant role in building up political unity of India and in
creating the forces that were to give leadership to a new stage
of the struggle for independence.

In the Indian social system which gradually evolved
after the break up of the ancient tribal society, the nature
of possession and utilization of landed property occupies an
important place. Marx pointed out that the characteristic
feature of the social system of India and of Asia was that
no individual had ownership rights on land. On this basis,
while distinguishing between various social formations, he
has used the terms "Asiatic Society" in some places.

Marx thought that during the ancient and medieval times,
the land, jointly owned by the community, was given for
cultivation to individuals or families in India. He believed
that this system continued till the consolidation of the British
domination. This is what he has written evaluating the situation
in India.

It can be seen that if we take the observation of Marx
literally, it does not correspond to reality. Recent investigations
have revealed that private ownership in land had
appeared in many parts of India even before the advent of
the British rule. Several documents dealing with transactions
in land (mortgages and sales, etc.) have been discovered. In
other words, this accumulated body of evidence shows that
in the Indian society which started initially in the form of
_Chaturvarnya_ and later in its extended form of castes and which
absorbed at a still later stage the non-Hindus also, private
ownership in land had already begun to appear, although slower
in pace and smaller in extent as compared to the sectors of
commerce and industry. Anyone who examines Marx's
method of investigation would be convinced that had these
documents and other materials come to his notice, he would
not have asserted that land in India was owned by the
community in common.

Whatever be the inadequacies in the opinion Marx held
on the details, the picture he has presented on Indian society
in general and on the landownership in particular was correct.

_Slavery_ in the sense that the labourer himself is the
property of the owner and production based on that never
existed in India on a wide scale. Neither did the kind of
_feudalism_ come to exist in India as in Europe, which replaced
_slavery_ through a revolutionary process, nor did a
capitalist class capable of destroying _feudalism_ and establishing
domination in the society as it happened in Europe. It
is this reality that Marx has indicated using the term "unchanging"
in his works on India.

Basic to this 'unchangingness' was the village community
that rose on the foundation of a social system anchored upon
caste-based customs and conventions. In that society each
individual or family had to perform an ascribed function in
return of which the individual or family was entitled to a
definite privilege and status in society. Avoiding or failing
to fulfil this function did not go well with one's self-respect.
Depriving one of his privileges and status was never tolerated,
either.

It was these same social relations based on customs and
conventions adopted and strictly practised by the society as
a whole that governed the pattern of ownership of landed
property, as they did in other domains in the life. Each one
of those who occupied the different layers of the society --- the
occupant of the land, the local chief, the provincial chief,
the king, and so on --- had partial rights on land, but none of
them had absolute right on it. Consequently, each of them
had a fixed share, and that alone, in the produce from the
land.

Different methods such as wars, conquest and change in
the administration, had been resorted to gradually reduce
the share of the tiller of the soil and to enhance the shares of
those occupying positions above him in the hierarchy. In this
sense, class exploitation became intensified. However, even
under the most intense class exploitation, the prescribed share
of the occupant was as valuable and unassailable as those of
sections above him. It can thus be seen that it is not irrelevant
to say that in a system in which each one in the society had
a right to a fixed share, private ownership in land, as it is
seen under _modern Capitalism_, did not exist.

When trade and the use of money began to develop in
a society in which different kinds of right on land and
different rates of share in the produce evolved through a
historical process, it was natural that those who had a share
in the ownership right on land made their share an object of
transaction. But, under the land ownership relations which
formed the basis of village communities in a society based on
the caste system, such transactions would be extremely rare.
The documents discovered by researchers after Marx were
of transactions that took place rarely.

The fact that such transactions did take place in some
parts of India does not negate fundamentally Marx's conclusions
in regard to the "unchanging" character of Indian
society and the non-existence of private ownership of land
in that society. It only confirms Marx's view that a revolution
in the land ownership relations was an urgent need to
facilitate the reconstruction and political unity of India.

The British had regularized land ownership relations
by introducing the _Zamindari_, _Ryotwari_, _Mahalwari_ and
various other systems in different parts of the country.
Although all these systems differed from one another, there
was one factor that linked them together, namely, the creation
of private ownership on land in India where it did not exist
before. As Marx pointed out, this was a revolutionary change.

According to the new system introduced by the British,
every piece of land now had an owner. Whatever may be
the name given to him, _zamindar_, _mirazdar_, landlord or
what have you, he enjoyed full rights over his land. He had
the right either to appropriate wholly for himself the produce
of the land or to give a share of it to others who assisted
him in the production, as he wished. Similarly, he had
also the right to obtain loans by mortgaging that property
or to sell it for cash. Even those who were landless got the
right to get land on mortgage or by purchase. In other
words, land ownership rights could also be brought for transactions
as in the case of any other form of private property.

While thus recognising landowners with full ownership
rights, the functions that were formerly attached to landownership
were taken away from it. Previously, all those
who were connected with land, from the actual possessor to
each one of those above him at various levels, had certain
functions to discharge. From the village artisan to the officer
in the army or in the civilian service, each had some
obligation to the village community or to the administrative
machinery above it. The rights over the land and the share
in its produce were determined in relation to such obligations.

The British severed all these links and divided the
entire system into two: the administrative machinery and
other social organizational forms on one side and the land
ownership rights on the other. The revolutionary transformation
brought about by the British in the landownership
relations consisted of payment of salaries from the exchequer
to the men in the military and civilian services forming
part of the administrative machinery, payment of remuneration
to the village artisans and other employees by those who
utilised their services as also fixing the wages of workers,
rent payable by tenants and tax payable by the landowners
to the government and interest to the moneylenders and so on.

As a result of these changes, a considerable section of
the people who had possessed various rights and privileges
were deprived of all such rights and privileges; millions of
common people lost the land (means of subsistence) they
possessed and became destitute. Similarly, local and provincial
chiefs and many other individuals and families associated
with administration lost the rights and privileges they
once enjoyed. The functions that they had been discharging
for generations were transferred to officials of the new
administration along with their rights and privileges. And
at the top of this administrative machinery stood the British
officials.

All this formed the basis for people's dissatisfaction
leading to the 1857--59 rebellion. It was, in fact, an explosion
caused by the discontent of wide sections of the people, from
the landed aristocracy at the top to the cultivating peasants
and other rural poor at the bottom, who were ruined by
agrarian revolution brought in by the British.

But there is another side of the coin. Although a big
section of the existing landowners lost the property right in
land, a new section of landowners was emerging with full
ownership right, in their place. They were free to collect
rent from tenant cultivators at rates they were pleased to
prescribe or evict tenants incurring their displeasure. They
were free either to lease out the land for cultivation or to
directly cultivate it employing labour. They were free also
to enhance their income to any extent through various other
means. It is true that they did not have the status in society
as local chiefs or feudal lords. Their preoccupation now
was to earn as much as they could by utilizing the ownership
rights bestowed upon them by the British and to rise up in
society.

The British not only created such a new class of landowners,
but also adopted steps to transform agricultural
technology. Imbibing the experience they had gained from
the transformations in agricultural technology in Europe,
particularly in England, as part of the economic changes
there, some of them ventured to start tea, rubber and indigo
plantations. Efforts were also made to increase the production
of commercial and industrial crops and to modernize
agricultural operations. These moves on the part of the
British considerably influenced the new landlords who were
concentrating all their attention on enhancing their income.
Thus emerged a new section of landlords whose mode of
production as well as ownership rights were distinctly different
from the former landlords.

Needless to say, this was an indication of the emergence
of a new set of (capitalist) landlords in place of the old pre-capitalist
landlords. There was an important difference
between the former and latter. The traditional landlords were
basically against the agrarian revolution brought by the
British. They were trying to protect the traditional system of
landownership and relations as also the functions and privileges
associated with it. The new section of landlords, on the
other hand, did not desire the continuance of the old system
as such. They desired to lead the new transformations that
were being brought about to their logical conclusion. That
was why while the former landlords stood with the mass
upsurge which ended in 1859, the new landlords not only
kept off themselves from the upsurge but also co-operated
the British in suppressing it.

These capitalist landlords, like the capitalists in trade
and industry, wanted the capitalist mode of reconstruction
initiated by the British to reach its logical conclusion. They
wanted to nurture the seeds of the capitalist development sown
by the British and lead it to fruition. They were eager to
acquire modern knowledge and to adopt new styles of work
and organisational methods for that purpose. They wanted
to see a _bourgeois_ society develop in India, stage by stage
though, and to share the leading position with the capitalists
in commerce and industry. In the process of attaining these
objectives they would in the long run come into conflict with
the interests of the British as they would with those of the
commercial and industrial capitalists. In other words, they
also would participate actively in the next stage of the
_freedom struggle_ as other sections in the capitalist society.

## _VANGUARDS_ OF THE NEW EPOCH

As we have seen, the result of the agrarian policy of the
British in India was the elimination of the domination of the
feudal lords and the development of a new section of capitalist
landlords. Its impact was not, however, confined to the
economic sector alone. It exerted immense influence on
all spheres of the socio-cultural life. It was as a logical culmination
of this process that a new political movement
emerged subsequently under the leadership of the _bourgeoisie_.

The socio-cultural life of medieval India was associated
with feudal landownership in the economic sector and with
the traditions of the classical works written in Sanskrit, Pali,
Persian, Arabic, etc., in the cultural sphere. Till the establishment
of the British rule, the repository of knowledge that
India possessed consisted of the knowledge commonly developed
by the Hindu scholars well-versed in Indian languages
like Sanskrit and Pali and by the Islamic scholars well-versed
in the Persian and Arabic languages. Eminent scholars in
various branches of knowledge like philosophy and mathematics
had emerged from among Hindus and Muslims. The
edifice of civilization that had come up in India that excelled
even Europe, until the technological revolution in the wake
of capitalist development there, was built on the foundation
of the _Varna_-caste system that had been developed in India
and the Islamic empires which left that system undisturbed.

It was this very foundation that was shattered when
British rule took roots here. The hatchet wielded by the
British rulers fell on the very roots of the medieval Indian
civilization in the forms of the _Brahmin_ dominated Hindu
culture and civilization, and the non-Hindu culture and civilization
developed by Islamic rulers. In place of the domination
of the _Brahmins_, _Kshatriyas_ and other upper _Caste
Hindus_ and of the Islamic rulers, the British formulated
their administrative policies in such away as to consolidate
the domination of the foreign rulers belonging to the Christian
faith. Cutting off the links which the Hindu-Islamic
religions had with the administrative set-up in the ancient and
medieval India, the new regime installed Christianity in its
place. This was a political transformation that had far-reaching
effects on the entire socio-cultural life.

In the earlier chapters we have already dealt with one
aspect of the reaction of the masses of Hindus and Muslims
and the elite classes which exercised influence on them, to
this development. They were intensely enraged at their being
deprived of their doctrines, caste-based customs and practices,
educational system and cultural ethos which they valued as
priceless possessions. As we have seen, it was this ire in part
that ignited the 1857--59 revolt that spread extensively and was
finally suppressed.

There was, however, another aspect of this development.
A section of the masses and another section of the elite class
had kept themselves aloof from this resistance. Further,
within the elite class itself had emerged a section which had
come to realize that the old social system and cultural life
ought to be destroyed and replaced by the system which the
British had built in their own country.

The lower middle class and poorer sections of the society
were not conscious of the superiority of the new society; nor
did they demonstrate the desire to establish that system in
India. Every one, however, began to depend on the British
to get employment under the new administration. For those
sections of the people who were deprived of their means of
life as a result of the destruction of the feudal system and
the rural life, the only way open to eke out a living under the
British was to obtain jobs under the rulers.

Since a considerable section of the people, both in the
elite class and the common people had thus to depend on the
British rulers, they welcomed the emergence of the new society.
One of the main reasons for this situation was the
modern system of education that was spreading rapidly in
the country. Instead of imparting knowledge based on Hindu
and Muslim philosophy and depending on the Oriental languages,
a new system of education that was intended to impart
modern knowledge to the pupils was adopted. To suit this
purpose, English became the medium of instruction. Parallel
to the _Pathasalas_ and _Madrassas_ which imparted Oriental
cultures in general and Indian culture in particular through
Sanskrit and Persian languages, modern English medium
schools and colleges teaching modern science and humanities
like history began to emerge.

This change in the educational system which was being
brought about led to sharp differences of opinion even among
the rulers. One section strongly advocated for facilities to
provide Oriental education, while another section argued
equally strongly against the utility of Oriental education
and for modern Western education. As the culmination of
this debate which lasted for nearly half a century, the
Government adopted the policy of establishing modern educational
institutions (schools and colleges) with English as
the medium of instruction.

This difference of opinion appeared among the elites of
India as well. Among the Indians also there was a section
advocating the establishment of schools and colleges with
English as the medium of instruction to impart modern
knowledge. This section believed that those who were organizing
revolts against the rulers with the intention of maintaining
ancient and medieval Indian culture and civilization were,
in fact, trying to arrest the progress of the country and taking
the people backwards. They also believed that India
could advance only if a radical transformation was brought
about as in Europe, imbibing modern knowledge being disseminated
by the British rulers. As representatives of Indians
with social consciousness, they presented memoranda before
the rulers in India and in England against Oriental education
and in favour of Western education.

Among this section of people, special mention needs to
be made of Raja Ram Mohan Roy who may rightly be
called the founding leader of the _bourgeois_ nationalist movement
in India. Unlike the Jhansi Ranis and the Bahadur
Shahs, he did not wish to save the socio-cultural life of India
from British domination. Rather, his aim was to bring about
the kind of socio-cultural transformation that the British had
brought about in their own country.

The activities of Ram Mohan Roy and his colleagues
in this direction will be dealt with in the next chapter. Here
we will refer to his activities in the field of education. In
a letter to Governor General, Lord Armherst, he pointed out
that:

>No improvement can be expected from inducing
young men to consume a dozen of years of the most valuable
period of their lives in acquiring the niceties of Baikaran
(Vyakarana) or Sanskrit grammar", or from the speculations
of _Vedanta_ or from _Mimamsa_ or _Nyaya_ and wanted the
Government to promote a more liberal and enlightened system
of education, embracing Mathematics, Natural Philosophy,
Chemistry, Anatomy, with other useful sciences. ...[^05/7]

[^05/7]: Cited in Tara Chand, _History of the Freedom Movement of India_, Vol II,
p. 189.

It was these views of Ram Mohan Roy among others
that subsequently induced the British government, following
the recommendations in the famous Macaulay minute to
take a decision in favour of introducing Western education
in India.

Comparing these views of Ram Mohan Roy with the
feelings of the participants of the people's uprisings, it might
seem that he was a devotee of the British. And viewed from
the stand-point of the _anti-imperialist_ movement that developed
later, he was a devotee of the British. But his loyalty
was not to the British rule, but to the new (_bourgeois_) society
and its cultural values which the British were trying to impart
to the people of India. For instance, Ram Mohan Roy
strongly advocated freedom of the press, another contribution
of European _bourgeois_ society, with the same vigour
as he advocated the introduction of modern education with
English as the medium of instruction. He not only welcomed
the publication of newspapers, in the beginning under the
auspices of the foreigners and later under Indians, openly
criticizing the government and its officials, but also took initiative
to start a newspaper. When the Government tried to
implement acts to suppress the freedom of the press, as they
could not tolerate a free press, he strongly opposed the move.

The notes Ram Mohan sent first to the authorities in
India and later to those in England, protesting against
the 1823 Press Act muzzling the press are well known.
Although he dealt with only the topic of freedom of the press
in those notes, they contained the urge for independence of
the country which was expressed later by his successors
amongst the _bourgeois_ nationalists. The agitations that Ram
Mohan carried on for a new educational system based on
modern sciences and for the freedom of the press, were
events of historic significance. An examination of the documents
he had prepared on these two issues would show that
the agitation he had launched was the forerunner of the
efforts of Indian _bourgeoisie_ to take the Indian society along
the path of _Capitalism_. The scope of the agitation was limited
and its language 'moderate', because the _bourgeoisie_ at that
time was in its infancy.

Although Ram Mohan Roy's name has been specifically
mentioned here, he was not an isolated individual. As we
shall see in the next chapter, he was, in fact, the representative
of an emerging section anxious to modernize the Indian
society which has been dependant mainly on Hindu culture
and civilization.

Although they formed only a small minority of the
population, they were the vanguard of an all-pervading social
revolution that was to take shape in the future. The
waves of the slogan of "Liberty, Equality and Fraternity",
reverberated in the historic French Revolution, had swept
through their hearts. The inspiring message of the socio-cultural
renaissance and the politico-economic revolutions
that had swept throughout Europe since the 17th century
had stirred them. They viewed modern education and
freedom of the press as the beginning of the efforts to modernize
India along the same path.

It was in Bengal that this section emerged first and
started functioning in a well organized manner. As we know,
it was there that the British first established their domination.
It was only after a few decades of obtaining the _Diwani_ in 1765 from the Emperor of Delhi to administer the areas
covering Bengal and its surroundings, that the British established
themselves in South India and Bombay. The northern
part of India came under their sway only in the middle of
the 19th century. Therefore, modern education and independent
journalism which made the beginnings in Bengal
spread to South India and Bombay, and finally reached
North India only in the last stage of this development.

A similar time lag could be discerned even in the matter
of religions, castes and communities. The foreign trading
companies had also carried on Christian religious propaganda
in an organized manner along with their trading operations.
As such, the Christian communities which had existed in
many parts of India even earlier had a closer affinity than
the other communities with the foreign colonizers from the
very beginning. Indian Christians also participated in the
propagation of Christianity conducted by the foreigners by
starting printing presses and publishing journals and other
materials. As such, in all these sectors, Christians were far
ahead of Hindus and Muslims.

Next to the Christians it was the Hindus who forged
links of friendship with the foreign rulers. Hindus belonging
to the upper castes were engaged, even in the old society, in
various intellectual avocations. They, therefore, desired to
acquire modern education and to reconstruct their mode of
life in such a way as to enable them to preserve their old
positions even under the British domination. Thus, they began
acquiring modern education.

The Muslim elites, however, turned against modern
civilization, because of their nostalgia for the days of _Mughal
Empire_ and the desire to revive the mode of life of those
days. This was, in fact, the main reason for the backwardness
of the Muslims which adversely affected the Indian
national movement in the later days.

There was another reason for Bengal being an example
to other regions in renaissance, as it was in the social and
cultural spheres. The _Zamindars_ who obtained property
rights under the _Permanent Settlement_ --- the new landlord
class which had no other relations with land than that of
collecting rent from the tenants --- had emerged first in Bengal.
The provision that they could collect as much rent as they
pleased rapidly enriched them. They used this newly acquired
wealth in leading a luxurious life in Calcutta which was also
the capital of British India to establish themselves in trade
and industry and to seek their own ends by establishing friendly
relations with the new rulers. A considerable section
among them left the rural areas and settled permanently in
Calcutta. It became customary for them to go once in a year
to the villages to collect rent or just to send their agents for
that purpose. There were many among them who had never
seen even once the landed property which they owned or the
farmers who cultivated those lands.

It was from this section that the leaders of the socio-cultural
renaissance in Bengal rose. Whether it be in the
social reforms movements like the _Brahma Samaj_, or in the
spheres of arts and literature, or in the different revolutionary
political movements, it was this class that provided leaders
and active participants. And it was because no other region
had such a class and a city like Calcutta that all other
states lagged behind Bengal. But, these same social forces
which had emerged first in Bengal were certainly developing
in other parts of India also.

## FOR SOCIAL REFORMS

The Bengali Hindu's urge for a thorough transformation
of the caste-communal customs and the movement that started
to achieve it were the Indian parallels of the European
renaissance. Raja Ram Mohan Roy who was the best known
among those who led this movement was not a mere social
reformer; he was also a brilliant representative of the _bourgeois_
nationalist ideologies.

We have referred earlier to the agitation he had launched
to defend the freedom of the press. He unhesitatingly
expressed his views on various political issues, including the
political future of India. He was optimistic about India
achieving independence in the long run.

Ram Mohan had also paid attention to international
issues. For instance, in 1830, when a revolution was going
on in France, a French naval vessel visited India and he felt
particularly anxious to go inside the ship to personally express
his sympathy to the French Revolution. Again, when the
British Parliament was debating on a bill for _administrative
reforms_ in India which he regarded progressive, Ram Mohan
declared that he would sever all his relations with England
if the bill fell through the Parliament. In short, he viewed the
political issues of India as an integral part of the _bourgeois_
democratic movements embracing the whole of Europe, including
England, of that time.

Ram Mohan Roy, however, maintained the firm view
that the problems relating to the Hindu caste-based customs
and the _resultant_ misery of the people were of more immediate
importance than the political transformations of
India and the world. Not that India's independence was less
important, but he rather considered that in order to tackle
that issue, it was essential to liberate the Indian society from.
the chains of caste-based customs. He also anticipated the
assistance and co-operation of the British in the national
efforts to achieve this objective.

Before going into the details of the content of the social
reforms that Ram Mohan had envisaged, it is necessary to
make one thing clear. Many of the educated sections among
the people of India who were within the sphere of influence
of the British rulers were sympathetic to Christianity and the
missionaries who were propagating that religion. Ram Mohan
was not one among them. On the contrary, he even opposed
the religious preachings of the Christian missionaries and
their attempts at proselytization. He did not conceal his
faith in the _Vedas_ and _Upanishads_ which were considered to
be the foundation of the doctrines of Hinduism, either. He
advised the Hindus to wholly imbibe the doctrines contained
in the _Vedic_ literature, and put them into practice.

At the same time, he paid particular attention to distinguish
the doctrines contained in the _Vedas_ which he considered
to be the essence of the Hindu religious faith, from
the superstitious beliefs and practices that had crept into the
social life of the Hindus. He also ensured that this distinction
was brought to the attention of others. He believed
that the caste rules and the caste-based customs and practices
were fundamentally opposed to the Hindu religious faith and
that they prevented the Indian people, including Hindus,
from reaching the level of other civilized peoples. In other
words, Ram Mohan Roy realized that it was necessary to
sweep the Hindu social life of the rubbish it had accumulated
for the emergence of a new Indian people, as independent
and civilized as the Europeans.

Ram Mohan wielded his sword mainly against the
ill-treatments towards woman and low caste people in the
Hindu society. He strongly opposed the denial of property
rights to women in the family, prohibition of widow re-marriage,
the system of _Sati_, polygamy, restrictions imposed
on schooling of girls, the _Purdah_ system confining women
within the home, and so on. He demanded that polygamy
and _Sati_ be banned and that widows be given the right to
re-marry.

He also advocated similar social reforms in the caste
system. He attributed the stagnation of the Indian society
to the system of division of the people into castes and sub-castes.
He was of the view that it was essential to destroy
the caste system in order to unite the Indian people into a
nationality.

It was during the first three decades of the 19th century
that Ram Mohan started propagating these ideas. Initially
it was confined to Bengal, because it was there, as we have
seen earlier, that conditions developed for such a movement
following the emergence of a new landlord class. Gradually
it spread to other parts of the country, in which even those
who belonged to the lower castes also participated. Particular
mention should be made, in this connection, of Jotiba Phule,
the founding leader of the _non-Brahmin_ movement in
Maharashtra.

Unlike Ram Mohan, Phule was born in a low caste
family. And for this reason, he could not complete his
education till he received the aid and assistance of Christian
priests. He had also to suffer a lot of indignities from the
_Brahmins_ and members of other high castes. As a consequence
of all these, Phule began his public life as one who was
enraged with the caste system in general and the domination
of _Brahmins_ in particular.

These differences between Ram Mohan and Phule could
be seen also in the character of the movements they had
started. The _Brahma Samaj_ founded by Ram Mohan
functioned mainly amongst the _Caste Hindus_. As such, it was
a movement directed generally against the caste system and
for equality between men and women. On the other hand, the
movement started by Phule was firmly rooted among the low
castes, especially the untouchables. Consequently, _anti-Brahminism_
was the core of its ideology. An official report
of the organization notes:

>For thousands of years, with the
help of their books, the Brahmans have declared the masses
low born and are exploiting them. To liberate them from
the thraldom of the sacredotal authority and make them
conscious of their rights by educating them the '_Satyashodhak
Samaj_' was founded on 24th September 1873.[^05--1/1]

[^05--1/1]: Quoted in Tara Chand, _History of Freedom Movement in India_, Vol. II,
p. 274.

In order to demonstrate the nature of the living conditions
of the common people whom he represented, Phule presented
himself in a loin-cloth as the true representative of the
poverty-stricken Indian peasant, to the Duke of York, a member
of the British Royal family. This is a sufficient example of
the social perspective he was holding.

It was not only the _Brahma Samaj_ of Bengal and the
_Satyashodhak Samaj_ of Maharashtra that had worked for
social reforms. Similar movements in various forms appeared
in the different provinces during the close of the 19th century
and the beginning of the 20th century. While some of them
had similarities with the _Brahma Samaj_ of Raja Ram Mohan
Roy, others could be compared with the _Satyashodhak Samaj_
of Phule.

The social and class contents of both the movements
were in the final analysis the same. Whether they were organized
by the _Caste Hindus_ and landlords, or by the poor
section among the low castes, both of them were movements
that were capable of cutting at the very roots of the out-dated
Hindu society. What had given the inspiration and impetus
to these movements was the urge of the _bourgeoisie_ for
independence and progress that had begun to grow under the
British rule.

Similar movements had come up in Kerala, too, during
the last decades of the 19th century and in the 20th century,
although weak as compared with the movements of Bengal
and Maharashtra. A brief description of the movement in
Kerala has been given in a book written by the present
author sometime back.[^05--1/2] Here it must be pointed out that
the Travancore part of the present Kerala was ahead of the
Malabar part insofar as social reforms. If we examine the
reasons behind this difference we would get a clear picture
of the social forces that were at work behind such social
reforms movements.

[^05--1/2]: E.M.S. Namboodiripad, _Keralam Malayalikalude Mathrubhoomi_, (Kerala
the Motherland of Malayalees) in Malayalam, Calicut, 1947--48.

Following the fierce lights that took place between the
prince and the feudal lords in Travancore before the British
rule became established, the landed properties of the feudal
lords in Travancore were confiscated by the government and
made them state properties(_Pandaram vaka_). Under this system
a landownership system comparable with the _Ryotwari_ system
established by the British had came into being. Due to the influence
of the Christian community which had close affinity
to the Western (capitalist) civilization, and the special
characteristics of, individual officials of the administration,
Travancore provided fertile soil for _bourgeois_ social reforms.
English education, printing press and newspapers, etc., had
spread in Travancore more extensively than in other regions.

In Malabar, however, the strength of the old feudal
lords had subsisted without any change. All those landlords
who had fled during the military expedition of Tippu _Sultan_
of Mysore had been brought back. Their properties were
restored and the rights of their tenants were denied by the
British. Since the Muslims were predominant among the
non-Hindus in Malabar as against the Christians in Travancore,
and since they hated _bourgeois_ culture, _bourgeois_
advancement did not take place in Malabar as it did in
Travancore. Thus, while Kerala was lagging behind Bengal
and Maharashtra, within Kerala the Malabar region lagged
behind Travancore. But the issue relevant here is not which
region was advanced and which was backward. The fact is
that none of them was against the tendencies of _bourgeois_
development.

The movement started in Bengal during the early decades
of the 19th century under the leadership of Raja Ram
Mohan Roy had spread all over India by the first decades
of the 20th century. Depending on the historical background
of each province, the interrelationship among the different
castes and sub-castes, the speed of the emergence of the new
capitalist economy and culture, and the differences in the personal
characteristics of the people occupying key positions in
the administration, this movement developed with specific
local characteristics in the various regions.

Whatever might have been the differences, there was
one characteristic common to all regions, a common aim
that coordinated all of them. Everywhere it was a movement
aimed at the elimination of the Hindu social system which
had remained relatively static for centuries beginning from
the _Vedic_ times and the development of a _bourgeois_ culture.
As to the methods to be adopted for the realization of this
aim, three shades of opinion emerged --- one which adopted a
relatively 'reformist' attitude, another, an intense urge for a
revolutionary transformation and the third in between these
two. There were also various sub-sections within these
sections of opinion. Even the _Brahma Samaj_ was split into
two or three camps.

For this reason, and also because of the diversities in
the situations prevailing in the different provinces, a movement
embracing all parts the country or even all regions within
a single province did not emerge. But the slogans and
demands raised by Ram Mohan Roy became the forerunner
of the common perspective of the educated sections among
the Hindus all over the country. This, combined with other
movements to be described in the next few chapters, gave rise
to a new movement for national freedom as distinct from
that of the 1857--59 period, or, in a sense, negating it.

## DEVELOPMENT OF THE VERNACULARS

For centuries since the _Vedic_ period, several languages
and dialects were in use in India. The common people
used a variety of dialects and the rulers and the _intelligentsia_
used a standard literary language. In the North,
for instance, several _Prakrit_ dialects were used by the common
people for everyday communication, while Sanskrit
was used for administration and for transactions in the different
areas of knowledge. In ancient Sanskrit dramas, kings
and other noble characters spoke in Sanskrit, while the
commoners and women spoke in a _Prakrit_ dialect.

Similarly, in South India, a variety of dialect (_Kodum_)
Tamils were used by the common people and over them was
emerging a standard (_Sen_) Tamil, as Sanskrit in the
North, which was used by rulers as well as scholars in art
and literature and in the different branches of knowledge.

The distance between the dialects of the common people
and the standard language used by the elites continued to
exist through the ancient and medieval periods. Pali, a
_Prakrit_ language, developed as a standard written language
parallel to Sanskrit, following the emergence and growth of
the Buddhist religion. While the medium of the _Vedic_
civilization was Sanskrit, that of Buddhism was Pali.

Following the advent of _Mohammedans_ from West Asia,
and the establishment of their empire, Persian acquired the
position of the language of administration and the medium
for imparting knowledge, while Arabic became the medium
of religious education among the commoners and priests.

As the early Christians in India were those who had
migrated from the Syriac speaking regions, that language
came to be used for their religious education.

All these written languages were associated with the
social and cultural life of the elite class. So with the development
of the class society in which administration became
more complex and with the development of cultural life in
various spheres, each one of these written languages developed
to a greater or lesser extent in accordance with the specific
peculiarities of each. Innumerable works were written in
each of these languages, some of them rising to the position
of "classics".

However, at the lower level, the various dialects remained
as they were. Like the non-elite "_dramatis personnae_"
in the Sanskrit dramas, the commoners used these dialects
in their daily life. When a few fortunate individuals rose
in position to join the elite class and began to participate in
administration and culture, they too began to use a standard
language like Sanskrit. During the ancient and medieval
periods, the relations between the dialects and the standard
written languages remained an index of the gap that existed
between the common people and the elites.

A change in this situation occurred by about the 12th
century. Several of such dialects began to be written down and
standardized. For example, the _Braj Bhakha_ (Braj language)
which had hitherto been regarded as a _Prakrit_ language began
to be cultivated, which later developed as Hindi. Similarly
developed the written languages like Marathi, Gujarati and
Bengali, etc., in the North, and Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam
in the South. These written languages were evolved
through a long process of merger of many old _Prakrit_ dialects
in the North and _Kodum Tamils_ in the South.

The literary works produced in these newly evolved
languages were religious in their content. The writers of
these works tried through them to inculcate among the
common people in the language understood by them the
religious beliefs and faiths that had been incorporated in the
works written earlier in Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic and Syriac.
As such, compared to the works written in the languages of
the elite class, these new literary works were simpler, and
natural in their content. Many of these writers had themselves
risen from the ranks of the peasantry, agricultural workers,
artisans and such other sections of the people. It is well
known, for example, that the development of Malayalam as
an independent literary language began with the writings of
Thunchattu Ezhuthachan, born in a low-caste family. The
content of his works and those of other poets following
him belonging to _Bhakti_ (devotion) school of literature was the
same as those in the epics written in Sanskrit. But in their form
and style and in versification, the works of Ezhuthachan and
other litterateurs of the early period like Kunchan Nambiar
and Cherussery Nambuthiri were closer to the spoken dialects
and folk literature that were extant in Kerala than to Sanskrit.

All other present-day literary languages of India also
underwent similar processes. It is, therefore, customary to
characterize the period in which these works were written
and the movement that emerged at that time as the period
of _Bhakti_ movement (the period of the movement of devotional
literature). These works were the result of the efforts made
by the _Vaishnavite_ poets to reach the common people with
their religious doctrines.

The impact of this movement, rather than confining
itself to the domain of religion, was the emergence of a new
movement affecting the social life of the people as a whole.
Specifically, while the social distance and difference between
the elites and the common people persisted, it led to the
development of a common language --- a new link binding these
two sections together.

There were indications of a similar development even
earlier when the Pali language began to develop in parallel
with Sanskrit. It is now generally admitted that the emergence
of Buddhism was symbolic of the people's movement against
the domination of the upper strata of the castc system over
society. For the same reason Pali, one of the _Prakrit_ languages,
rose to the position of a medium of religious instruction
in place of Sanskrit and developed into a medium for spreading
knowledge, as important as Sanskrit.

Nevertheless, in the background of the class society
existing at that time, Pali, which in a sense emerged as a
challenge to Sanskrit, itself got transformed subsequently
into "another Sanskrit". As distinct from this, the new vernaculars
that emerged through the _Bhakti_ Movement, were
based on firmer foundations. Unlike thic philosophical works
written in Pali, the woks produced in the vernaculars became
an integral part of the everyday life of the masses of people.
Poets like Tulsidas, Kabir, Tukaram and Ezhuthachan came
to be regarded as the common property of the families in
their respective regions. Unlike in the case of Sanskrit and
Pali literature, wide groups of readers of these works also
emerged from among the common people. This change was
the result of the changes that had come about in the socio-cultural
life of the people.

As we have seen earlier, the society in the ancient and
medieval times was based on almost self-sufficient village
communities and families. A major portion of the wealth
produced by the members of each family through their own
labour was consumed by themselves. Only a small portion
was exchanged as surplus with other families in the village.
And out of the commodities thus exchanged, only a still
smaller portion was exchanged as surplus with the neighbouring
villages. In other words, out of the products made
in the country as a whole, only a very small share was
brought into exchange as commodities.

However, as a consequence of the developments that
took place in the medieval period, the extent of the exchange
of commodities gradually enlarged. Under the _Mughal
Empire_ in North India, and also in South India during the
same period, commodity exchange and the amount of money
involved in such exchanges and new sectors of activities such
as money-lending, etc., began to develop. As the number of
traders and industrialists engaged in these activities as well as
that of the producers who had to deal with them also increased,
the need for exchange of ideas among these various sections
also increased correspondingly. The role of self-sufficiency
in the relationship among villages diminished, while the
extent of mutual dependence increased. Thus arose the need
for the emergence of new standard written languages out of
the existing spoken dialects, in additian to the languages being
used exclusively for communication among the elites. Corresponding
to the growth of exchanges among the people, the
need for a medium for exchange of ideas grew. Even at this
stage, in the spheres of activities in which the elites were
involved, such as administration, development of talents in
literature and culture, acquisition of skills in the various
areas of knowledge, etc., the old standard language had to
be depended on. The new languages which were being
developed were not of much help in these matters.
At the same time, side by side with the educational and
cultural activities through the medium of the standard
languages, it became absolutely necessary to have a language
more popular and democratic in nature in order to conduct religious
education and propagation of ideas.

The development of the vernaculars during the British
rule was the result of the continuance of this process. For,
the administrative system established by the British reduced
regularly the elements of self-sufficiency in the interrelationship
among villages and among families in the same village
and accelerated and intensified the process of increasing
mutual dependence at an unprecedented rate. Exchange of
commodities, the use of money and the emergence of a new
society based on these factors, influenced the social life more
extensively and rapidly than never before. With the advent
of the Portuguese traders began the process of tying each
producer and each consumer in every part of the country to
a common market or even to the world market. As the
British rule got established and consolidated, this process
not only continued but also became intense.

It was at this stage that new standard written languages
developed further by merging of many of the old spoken
dialects. Instead of confining literary works to the sphere
of religious education and propaganda as it was during the
_Bhakti_ Movement, literature in these new languages came to
be used in the areas of secular knowledge also. They began
to develop as part of a new literary movement, purveying to
the common people modern scientific knowledge which developed
in Europe in the wake of the industrial revolution.
Side by side, literary prose in general and the branches of
short stories, novels, literary criticism, etc., in particular,
which had evolved as part of modern (capitalist) literature,
also grew in each of these new languages.

It may appear to be a paradox that this process of bringing
about basic transformations in the cultural life of India
was led by foreign traders, from the Portuguese to the
British.

These foreign merchants, in fact, made efforts to impose
on the Indian people the European culture and civilization
showing no compassion towards the cultural traditions, languages
and literature of India. It was as part of these efforts
that they conducted their educational and cultural activities
in India.

It must be noted that it was the missionaries engaged in
proselytizing the Hindus and Muslims of India to Christianity
who presented for the first time to the various Indian
languages with modern scientific grammar, dictionaries, etc.
The printing press they started and the books they
published marked the begining of a prose style in the modern
languages. And with the consolidation of British domination
in India, works with contents relating to science and other
disciplines of modern knowledge also began to be published
in the form of text books when the British decided to start
schools and other educational institutions with a view to creating
a generation of educated people for the stability of
their regime.

It is evident that the intention of the British was not in
any way connected with any desire on their part to modernize
India. On the other hand, they knew that they would
be able to exploit the Indian people to the maximum extent
only if they kept India as much backward as possible in
the scientific and technological fields. At the same time, in
order to carry on cleverly their exploitation, they were forced
to destroy the foundation of ancient Indian civilization and
culture. They had also to bring up new generations of Indians
imbued with modern (capitalist) civilization and culture,
and spread among the masses of people at least some elements
of that culture and civilization. For this purpose, it was
essential to develop modern literary prose, and as part of it,
short stories, novels, literary criticism as also scientific and
technological books and theses in the modern Indian languages
which had begun to evolve during the _Bhakti_ Movement,
but as distinct from those that appeared during that Movement.

In other words, the British who were striving to establish
the domination of English language and literature over India
had to take the initiative and leadership to develop the vernaculars
of India in order to achieve that objective. They
made efforts to develop the vernaculars as languages subservient
to and dependent on the English language. But the
development of these vernaculars itself turned into an important
aspect of the freedom movement which was developing
against the British domination.

##  _INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISM_: DEVELOPMENT AND LIMITATIONS

As a logical culmination of the kind of socio-cultural
transformation we have discussed in the preceding sections,
an "industrial revolution" should to have taken place in India.
And following such a revolution two mutually antagonistic
classes --- capitalists and the working class --- should have emerged
and developed rapidly. This was what happened in Europe
when it passed from _feudalism_ to _Capitalism_. In Asia,
too, during the last few decades of the 19th century, a similar
change had come about in Japan. Consequently, Japan pushed
back India and China with long traditions lasting for several
centuries, and rose to the position of a mighty imperialist
power as a potential threat to not only the Asian countries but
the European powers.

In India, too, objective conditions for such a transformation
had begun to emerge during the Mughal period and
in the centuries following its fall. The early form of _industrial
Capitalism_, namely, _mercantile Capitalism_ and _finance
Capitalism_ had become generally widespread. The merchant
class purchased surplus commodities from the rural population
and carried them to towns and villages situated hundreds
of miles away. The traders who took up this work had
formulated and practised all methods required for the purpose,
such as money transactions, terms and conditions governing
such transactions and measures to protect goods and money
from robbers on the way.

The section of the people, who with the requisite skill in
all these operations, had made profits out of them had exercised
considerable influence in the feudal society of those times.
They had even the capacity to give loans to the princes
and feudal lords when they needed funds to conduct wars or
to carry on their administration.

These mercantile and finance capitalists who emerged
and developed as part of the feudal society had contributed
considerably to the development of trade conducted by the
foreigners from the Portuguese to the British. Had these
foreign traders not obtained the help and assistance of this
section, they would have faced serious difficulties during the
earlier period when they had to operate merely as traders
without administrative authority.

Conversely, the enterprises of these foreign trading
companies and their officials had helped these mercantile and
finance capitalists. The development of trade and the consequent
expansion of transport of commodities and monetary
transactions helped the intermediaries such as Indian traders
and moneylenders to raise their position in social life and
enhance the rate of their profits. The section of the people
who grew both in number and financial capacity in this
manner became loyal and subservient to the foreign trading
companies.

In Europe and also in Japan in Asia, when the growth
of this section reached a particular stage, they themselves
and the society as a whole became thoroughly transformed.
These capitalists who till then confined their activities to
trade and money-lending began to enter the area of industrial
production. The owner of the capital which he used
hitherto for exchanging commodities between the producers
and consumers and for transporting the commodities began
to expand his areas of activities by investing capital to buy
raw materials and the machinery to process them and also
to hire labour to work on the machine, thereby transforming
himself into the industrial capitalist engaged in production.
From the position of an intermediary functioning in between
the producer and consumer, he transformed himself to the
position of an organizer actively participating in the process
of production.

The foundation for this transformation in the owner of
capital was laid through the revolutionary transformations
that had been taking place in the technology of the process
of production. The industrial revolution, as is well known,
was the natural' culmination of the gradual technological
transformations brought about in the traditional industries
which were evolved on the basis of the personal capacity of
those who had acquired skills in handicrafts, and the consequent
invention of machines. With this development, it
became necessary that a new section of intermediaries who
could systematically organize the process of production and
invest capital required for the purpose, should come to participate
in the process, in addition to the customary intermediary
between the consumer and the producer. When the machineries,
which were relatively simple in the initial stages, and
the production based on them became more and more complex,
more and more capital became necessary to install new
machines, to engage more workers to operate these machines
and to acquire raw materials. Thus, the change that came about
in the production relations (the economic system) following
such radical transformations in the production process, called
"technological revolution", laid the foundation for _industrial
Capitalism_.

This process did not take place in India. Although the
function of trading and usurer capital expanded on an unprecedented
scale, it did not enter the sphere of production.
Capital continued to be invested, as before, in the distribution
of products and other related activities without investing
it to set up factories with machines and other means of
productions, and to acquire raw materials and to engage
labour. There were two reasons for this.

The first and foremost reason was that the foundation
for the development of _Capitalism_ in India was laid by foreign
traders. They knew that if the same kind of economic
transformation and "industrial revolution" as in Europe were
brought about in India and consequently _Capitalism_ developed
here, it would pose a threat to their own self-interest. Their
intention was to use India to exploit at low prices her raw
materials required for the production in the industries in their
own countries and for creating a market for their products
at prices most favourable to them. For that purpose, they
wanted to ensure the development and modernization of
transport and such other facilities for reaching the raw materials
from the nooks and corners of India to the ports and
their shipment to England as also to reach their industrial
products to the Indian market. The development of the
transport system, the development in the areas of commerce
and banking, the growth of organized markets and the necessary
laws for this purpose were essential to serve their interests.
Similarly, the development of the production of industrial and
commercial crops by starting estates where modern farming
operations would be utilized was also essential. They introduced
in India modernization in the economic sphere keeping
these objectives in mind.

At the same time, they feared that their own growth
would be hampered if industries for processing the raw materials
available here were developed in India. Consequently,
they took all measures to ensure that no such moves for the
development of industries in India were made by Indian
capitalists. In the early days of development of _Capitalism_
in England, Indian handloom cloth and other consumer goods
were able to effectively compete with the English industries.
They brought in legislative measures to prevent such a competition.
Later on, when possibilities arose of marketing
English products in India, they opposed taking steps to save
the handicrafts of India from the English competition. In
other words, the very same rulers who had in the earlier stages
imposed tariffs in their own country in order to protect the
development of English industries, prevented, using their
political power, the imposition of tariffs in India, which was
essential for the survival of the Indian handicrafts.

The second factor that stood in the way of an independent
development of _industrial Capitalism_ in India was the
social system prevailing in India. There were no objective
conditions in the Indian society, divided into various castes
and sub-castes, for facilitating or encouraging the modernization
of the production process. The system that existed in
India was one in which each caste or sub-caste was ascribed
a specific occupation and each member born of a particular
caste or sub-caste carried out production activities in his
ascribed occupation with the skill traditionally handed down
to him from his predecessors with social customs and beliefs
that prevented him from breaking this tradition. This social
system discouraged them from bringing about even the slightest
change in the technology of production, whereas the core
of industrial revolution was the introduction of constant changes
in the technology of production process.

Thus, in India, both the internal social system and the
foreign rulers simultaneously placed obstacles on the path of
bringing about an industrial revolution in the sense of a
transition from the system of handicrafts to the modern
mechanized industry. A modern _bourgeois_ society could
come up in India only by removing both these obstacles.
Even if a people's movement had grown up against any
one of these obstacles, there was no possibility, in the
circumstances then prevailing, of bringing about a real industrial
revolution. Instead of such a development, what would
have actually taken place was a polarization between those
who opposed foreign domination and those who opposed the
maintenance of the traditional social system, the two
sections ranging themselves in opposite camps. It was impossible,
in the objective conditions present in that period, for
people to become conscious of the fact that it was essential
to cut at the very roots of the traditional social system to
throw the foreigners out of the land and conversely that for
destroying the old social system and for bringing about a
social revolution, it was essential to end foreign domination.

But, as pointed out by Marx, the foreign powers who
had taken up the mission of destroying the old traditional
society also discharged the mission of laying the material
foundations for a social revolution. By establishing a centralized
administration in India, by introducing rail-roads
and other modern systems of communication and by linking
the village social system with the world market, the British
had sown the seeds of modernization of the society in India.
This promoted the investment in industrial production of a
small portion of the capital which was being utilized for
trading and money-lending operations. Some Indian capitalists
started establishing industrial undertakings on the model
of the industries started by the British. This process which
began during the earlier years of the 19th century, gradually
began to advance. They started jute mills in Bengal and cotton
textile mills in Bombay under Indian ownership.

The first cotton mill started functioning in Bombay in 1854. By 1866, the number of mills increased to 13 and to 32
by 1876. Thereafter, it registered a steady increase with 47
in 1881, 49 in 1885, 67 in 1891and 69 in 1905, By the closing
years of the 19th century, the textile mill industry in Bombay
employed over a hundred thousand workers.

Those who had initiated this process were the _Banias_
and the _Parsis_ who had been functioning since a number of
years before the commencement of British domination in the
trading and money-lending sectors, If we go into the family
history of each of them, we can find that they belonged to
that section which had earlier served the feudal lords and
later the British. They, therefore, can be rightly designated
as the commission agents of foreign capitalists or _compradors_.
They realized that their growth was linked with the maintenance
and growth of foreign domination. Thus, they functioned
as devout loyalists of the British during the period 1857--59
and thereafter. (It may be noted that a textile mill
established by one of them, Jamshedji Tata, was named the
Empress Mill, to commemorate the ascension of Queen
Victoria as the "Empress of India".)

But once they stepped into the sphere of industry and
started making progress, they found that there were some
contradictions between their own interests and the foreign
vested interests. Consequently, they began to turn themselves
into a section which, on one side, was "devout loyalists" of
the British and, on the other, opposed to the policies of the
British rulers. The most prominent representative of this
section was the Tata family. The founder of this industrial
house was Jamshedji Tata, who started as an agent purchasing
from producers materials needed for wars being conducted
by the British and transporting them to the required centres.
This work which he started in 1857 brought him considerable
profits during the days of the war. Utilizing this money, he
started trade with China and also entered the sphere of
speculative transactions in cotton. Subsequently, he ventured
into many industries and founded the first steel mill in India.
Now, the Tatas are one of the top monopoly industrial houses
of India.

This process of industrialization was repeated in
Ahmedabad. But, in Calcutta such a development did not
take place among the Indian capitalists. Most of the industries
in that region were established by the British. Later,
when Indians started the enterprises there, it was not the
Bengalis but the _Marwaris_ who came from outside Bengal,
who occupied positions. This is attributed to the differences in
the landownership relations established by the British. The
reforms introduced in Bengal were suited to the creation of
a new landowning class. Specifically, the conditions created
there were suited to the emergence of lawyers, journalists,
intellectuals and leaders in the cultural life. The _Zamindari_
system introduced through _Permanent Settlement_ was not
helpful for the emergence of an industrial _bourgeoisie_.

On the other hand, the _Ryotwari_ system introduced in
Bombay paved the way for the development of _Capitalism_ in
the industrial sector also, as in the socio-cultural sphere. The
_Banias_, the _Parsis_ and the _Marwaris_ of Maharashtra, Gujarat
and Rajasthan were engaged even earlier in trades and money-lending.
As a consequence, they did not find it difficult to
establish industrial enterprises in Bengal, even before the
Bengalis entered the field, in addition to starting industries
in Bombay and Gujarat.

The development of modern national independence
movement in India was a combined result of the _industrial
Capitalism_ that began to emerge in Bombay and the
socio-cultural renaissance in Bengal led by Raja Ram Mohan
Roy and others.

## EMERGENCE OF INDIAN POLITICAL ECONOMY

One of the results of the rise of industrial capitalists as
a class was the emergence of a new scientific discipline which
may be called "Indian political economy".

The early actions of the British in India resulted in the
creation of two new sections among the people: the new
(capitalist) landowners and a section of educated men who
had acquired knowledge of European culture and in other
scientific disciplines through modern educational institutions.
It may be said that a majority of the latter section came
from among the new landowning families.

With the increase in the number of people belonging to
those two sections and with the growth of their organized
strength, movements for social reforms and cultural renaissance
emerged. But, the modernization of social life envisaged
by these sections remained confined mostly to the spheres of
family relations and cultural movements. The social reformers
and leaders of cultural renaissance among them did not have
the perspective of bringing about an industrial revolution
as in Europe, which laid the foundations for modernization
there. The section with such a perspective appeared only
during the last decades of the 19th century.

The most eminent among that section was Dadabhoy
Naoroji (1825--1917). The most respected among the earlier
leaders and founders of the nationalist movement, he was
known as the "Grand Old Man" of India.

He was not merely a political leader; he was also the
founder of research in Indian economics, who examined the
problems of Indian economy in the light of modern _bourgeois_
political economy and adopted Indian national interests as
the basis for such examinations.

The conclusion of his studies, which he formulated as
what was known as the "theory of drain", pointed to the
fundamental difference that existed between the free countries
like England and the dependent countries like India in the
production of wealth, its distribution and utilization. The
essence of the theory was that, while the wealth produced in
England through the labour of the workers of that country
was utilized to meet the various needs of the people of
England, a considerable portion of the wealth produced by
the Indian labour in India was being drained out to England.

Dadabhoy's studies were based on statistical data
published officially by the government and on the theories
of modern political economy. The administrators in England
were all Englishmen. The salaries and allowances earned by
them were being spent within that country. Consequently,
the expenditure incurred by the government of that country
turned into the income of one or the other section of the
people of England.

In India, on the other hand, the administrators were
mostly Englishmen. Only a part of their salaries and other
income was spent in this country; a considerable portion was
drained out to England. Moreover, the salary of an English
official was far higher than that of an Indian official doing
the same job. Besides, India had to bear the expenditure
for the wars being fought by the British and for the armed
forces maintained for the sole purpose of her imperialist
expansion which India never wanted.

Similarly, he examined carefully the developments in
the various spheres of the economic life of the country, such
as exports and imports, commerce, public debt, the declining
handicraft of India, etc. Dadabhoy showed that an amount
not less than 20 million pound sterling was being drained
out to England annually out of 50 million pound sterling
collected as tax from the people of India every year. He
further showed that as a result of this decades old "drain"
India was getting more and more pauperized.

With his studies also began the technical process of
estimating the national income in India similar to that in
vogue in other countries where _bourgeois_ economics had
developed. As V.K.R.V.Rao, a noted economist, has stated,
the national income he had calculated at a time when the
technique was in its infancy, was by and large error-free even
according to the methods of calculation of the later days.

The politically dependent status of India was crucially
relevant to all these calculations. Dadabhoy had no doubt
that India's _political slavery_ was responsible for her economic
decline and poverty. His studies thus gave rise to a new
method of investigation for the first time in the history
of India, combining economic analysis with laying of the
foundation for political agitations. Several articles and
booklets containing Dadabhoy's economic analysis were published,
and among those was a book entitled _Poverty and
un-British rule_. The title of this book itself is meaningful.
On one side, there was a sharp criticism of the economic
policies of the British (a plain speaking of the fact that it
was these policies that were pauperizing India more and more).
On the other side was the trust expressed in the statement
that this cruel exploitation was "_un-British_". This was the
basic approach of the Congress leadership and of Dadabhoy
Naoroji, one of the founder leaders of the Congress,
till the end of the First World War.

Dadabhoy was not an isolated individual. Many of his
contemporaries too had made analyses of this type. Modern
Indian (_bourgeois_) political economy was a new branch of
knowledge initiated by these personalities and developed
hand in hand with the advance of the national movement in
India.

As we know, modern _bourgeois_ political economy
originated at the hands of Adam smith, David Ricardo and
other English economists, on the basis of the situation obtained
in Europe in general, and in England in particular. Marx
enriched it in accordance with the interests of the working
class. In India, too, a _bourgeois_ political economy was emerging.
It was _bourgeois_ in character in the sense that it was
trying to study the Indian situation from the point of view of
_bourgeois_ political economy. On the other hand, it was Indian
in the sense that it was trying to establish that the British
rule was endangering India's national interests.

The names of two eminent personalities among those
who, besides Dadabhoy, gave rise to this discipline need
special mention. Ramesh Chandra Dutt (1841--1909) made
a significant contribution towards the study of agrarian problem,
while Mahadev Govind Ranade (1842 to 1901) enriched
the conclusions arrived at by Dadabhoy and Dutt and gave
directions to the Indian people as to what they should do in
the light of the circumstances that resulted from the British
rule as explained by them. The theory that they together
formulated, in a 'moderate' tone though, was a firm challenge
to the British.

None of them, nor any other _bourgeois_ economist who
followed them, was a revolutionary in the sense in which we
understand the term today. They were at pain to make it
clear that they were loyal to the Crown, but demonstrated
with irrefutable data that India was getting pauperized under
the rule of the British, the repository of their loyalty.

The social background of these three Indian economists,
Naoroji, Dutt and Ranade, is both fascinating and educative.

Dadabhoy Naoroji went to England as a representative
and partner of a Bombay trading family (belonging to the
Parsi community), which had ventured into _industrial Capitalism_.
While working for the commercial establishment which
sent him there, he studied various problems directly and
indirectly relating to trade and actively participated in the
political life of England. He also established contact with
the Liberal Party to which he felt closeness and appealed to
his colleagues in the party to bring about changes in the government's
policies towards India in conformity with its
ideologies. The economic analysis and political agitation he
conducted were the results of this work.

Dadabhoy was the direct representative of the _industrial
Capitalism_ that was emerging in India in the middle of the
19th century.

Like Dadabhoy, Ranade also belonged to Bombay. He
had, however, no direct links with _industrial Capitalism_. He
started his career as a teacher in economics. Later, he held
high positions under the government, including that of a
judge. While holding those positions he had occasions to
study the conditions in rural life, both as part of his official
work and otherwise. As a result of these studies, Ranade
came to the conclusion that it was essential to have an extensive
industrialization programme for the prosperity of the
people of India. He critically examined various theories of
European economists and wrote several works. He also took
initiative to form many organisations working for industrialization
and economic progress on the basis of the ideas he
formulated through his studies.

One of the important economic theories advanced by
Ranade relates to the role of the government in economic
development. Ranade pointed out that if the doctrine of
_laissez-faire_ followed by the British was pursued, a country
like India would not be able to attain progress and that it had
ceased to operate even in England. (It may be mentioned
that Ranade too had argued for active governmental intervention
to protect the interest of India in the competition
between the weak India and the mighty Great Britain).

It is clear that it was this policy which was advocated by
M. Visweswarayya half a century later in his book on Indian
planning and subsequently by the authors of the _Tata-Birla
Plan_ and that the programme of setting up a public sector
adopted by the Congress after independence was its natural
culmination.

Ramesh Chandra Dutt was a Bengali. Born in a new
landowning family, Dutt acquired modern education, obtained
employment under the government and rose to a position
which no Indian could aspire to achieve in those days. Based
on the problems of the people which he had occasions to
deal with as part of his official work, he examined and
studied through the viewpoint of an Indian, the decline that
befell the Indian economy in general and agriculture in
particular, under the British rule. Dutt irrefutably established
on the basis of statistical data that the recurrent famines all
over India were the inevitable result of the policies pursued
by the British which had pauperized both the peasants and
the artisans.

Besides these three, several others had analyzed the
Indian situation prevailing at that time and sharply criticized
the British rule. Some among them like Gopal Krishna
Gokhale, were the leaders of the national movement in its
early days. Their theories have not been specifically mentioned
here, not because those were unimportant, but the
theories advanced by these three themselves provided sufficient
indication to the nature of India's (_bourgeois_) political
economy that had begun to emerge following the rise of
_industrial Capitalism_ in India.

Even in the earlier periods, works on political economy
had appeared in India, for example, the _Arthasastra_ of Kautalya
in the Mauryan period. All such works represented the
situation that prevailed in their respective periods. However,
with the establishment of the British rule in India, new situations
came to prevail, which differed fundamentally from
those that prevailed in the earlier periods. The old ruling
class had perished. A regime in which no Indian had any
part to play had now come to exist. All attempts to end the
foreign rule and to re-establish the old met with defeats they
deserved. In place of the former ruling classes which made
these attempts, new classes had begun to emerge, which were
to conduct the _freedom struggle_ in other forms and methods.

It was the industrial _bourgeoisie_ that was in forefront
of these new classes. The early time activities of Dadabhoy
Naoroji who directly represented the _bourgeoisie_ and those
of Ranade and Dutt, though not directly representing that
class, but imbibing its interests, constituted the declaration
that the Indian _bourgeoisie_ had attained maturity.

## POLITICAL AGITATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS

Much before the works of Naoroji, Ranade and Dutt
exposing the disastrous effects of the British rule on India
began to appear, agitations in their primary forms had started
first in Bengal and later in other centres against some of these
ill-effects of the British rule and in defence of certain demands
of the people. And certain organisations also began to emerge
to carry on these struggles in an organized way.

As far as we know, the premier organization thus formed
was the Academic Association started by Ram Mohan Roy
in 1828. Although this organization was concerned primarily
with religious and moral questions, it also organized debates
on social and political issues.

It was led by members of the educated middle class who
had been imbued with the ideas of _bourgeois democracy_ that
was gaining strength in Europe. Therefore, it functioned with
a dual purpose of opposing the outmoded religious and caste
doctrines, on the one side, and promoting such values as
freedom and democracy, on the other. In 1838, the Society
for the Acquisition of General Knowledge was also formed,
which "discussed issues like trial by jury, freedom of the
press, forced labour in government departments".[^05/10]

[^05/10]: Tara Chand, _op. cit_, p. 525.

Needless to say, these were not only indications to suggest
that at least the educated middle class had started taking
interests in general political issues but also a means to foster
such interests among them.

In 1842, at the initiative of Dwarkanath Tagore, George
Thompson, an English liberal politician, was invited to India.
On his arrival in Calcutta, Thompson who had actively
participated in organizing the _anti-slavery_ agitation in England,
began his political activities and propaganda among
the groups on which Tagore had influence. As a result of
these activities, a new organization, the Bengal British India
Society, was formed in 1843. The objects of the Society were:

> to collect and disseminate information relating to the condition
of the people and the laws, institutions and resources
of the country; and to employ such other means of a peaceful
and lawful character... necessary to secure the welfare, extend
the just rights and advance the interest of all classes of the
Indian subjects.[^05/11]

[^05/11]: Tara Chand, _Ibid_, p. 526.

Meanwhile, another type of organization was formed in
Calcutta in 1838, the Land Holders' Society, to protect the
interests of the landowners. The object of this organisation
was to defeat by legal means the attempt of the government
to evict landholders from rent-free lands.

Following the formation of organizations of progressive,
educated middle class and of the landlords, the idea of coordinating
their activities through a single organization arose.
Thus, the British Indian Association was formed in 1851. It
began functioning with the objective of improving local administration
and the system of government and to "acquaint
the British public with the state of feeling in India with regard
to its past and future administration". The association deputed
a delegation to England in 1853 when a Bill was introduced
in the British Parliament to bring out changes in the
administration of the East India Company, to convey to the
members of Parliament the views and demands of the people
of India on that issue. One of the main demands raised by
them was that Indians must have the right to elect members
to the legislatures.

Similar kinds of activities were taking place in Bombay
also. Deshmukh, who had been writing under the penname
"Lokahitawadi" on common issues relating to the people,
strongly advocated the formation of a 'Parliament' with representation
of people from each town and district of India.
In 1852 an organization, the Bombay Association, was formed
in Bombay raising certain more 'moderate' demands.

This organisation, founded by a group of eminent
public men including Dadabhoy Naoroji, also deputed a
delegation to England in 1853 to exert influence on the British
Parliament. The purpose of sending this delegation was to
present certain charges of corruption in the administration
and to make certain practical suggestions for _administrative
reforms_. The suggestions included reorganization of the
legislative councils, appointing Indians in higher official
posts and establishment of universities.

In Madras, the Madras Native Association was founded
in 1853. Like the organizations in Calcutta and Bombay,
this organization also presented petition before the British
Parliament on the Bill that was under the consideration of
the Parliament. Explaining the "grievances and wants of the
Presidency", the petition pointed out the unjust and oppressive
nature of the _Zamindari_ and _Ryotwari_ systems under which
the peasant masses were reduced "to the deepest poverty and
destitution". The petition also pointed out the inefficiency,
delay and expenses of the courts of law, inadequacies in
roads, bridges and irrigation facilities and in the provision
for education. It also suggested a reduction in public expenditure
and to make the administration beneficial to the
people.

It must be noted that all these developments were prior
to the _Sepoy Mutiny_ and revolt of 1857--59. They provide a
general picture of how the educated middle class, including
those who had come from the new landowning class, viewed
the situations prevailing in the country in those days and the
future progress of the people. It is not hard to discern
that the views of these sections differed fundamentally from
the views of those who later participated in the 1857--59
revolts, in two respects.

_First_, the insurrectionists tried to uproot the British
regime which was extending its domination to wider areas and
replace it with the old feudal regime. The educated sections,
including those who had emerged from the new landlord
class, on the other hand, wanted to establish in India the new
(_bourgeois_) democracy that had emerged in Europe in general,
and in England in particular, as also the socio-economic
system basic to the _bourgeois_ democratic system.

_Second_, the insurrectionists tried to go along the path of
armed struggle to defeat the British in order to achieve their
aims. On the other hand, the educated middle class tried to
achieve their aim by earning sympathy and support of the
British public and the British government, through legal
means.

Naturally, therefore, the educated middle class had no
sympathy at all with the insurrectionists. In fact, the support
extended by the successors of Raja Ram Mohan Roy and
personalities like Dadabhoy Naoroji was an important factor
in the success of the British in suppressing the revolt. If the
country had to progress in accordance with their objective
of gradually transforming India into an independent (_bourgeois_)
democratic country with the sympathy and co-operation
of the people and the government of Great Britain, the
efforts of the insurrectionists must surely be defeated.

But, the expectations of these _bourgeois_ democrats began
to wane gradually. They began to realise that rather than
modernizing India and leading it along the path of _bourgeois
democracy_ as they expected, the British were rejecting even
the most 'moderate' and just demands of the people to
consolidate their domination over the Indian people. Shortly
after the suppression of the _Sepoy Mutiny and the revolt of 1857_-59 and the consolidation of the British rule, conflicts
started between the rulers and the members of the educated
middle class. The experience they gained from these frequent
conflicts taught them that the rulers would not budge a bit
from their position unless political agitations were organized
in a more extensive and determined way than what was built
up in connection with the petition submitted to the Parliament
on the 1853 India Bill.

The burning issues about which the democrats felt anxious
was the government policy of denying opportunities to Indians
for appointment in higher official posts. As we have noted
earlier, this was one of the important issues included in the
petitions to the Parliament by members of the delegation from
Calcutta, Bombay and Madras. The Government, however,
made the rules and regulations more rigorous to exclude
Indians, disregarding these petitions. This attitude of the
Government came under very severe criticism in the Indian
press.

An event which gave an all-India importance to this issue
took place in the meantime. A Bengali youth, Surendranath
Banerji (1848--1925), secured a high rank in the selection for
Indian Civil Service. To exclude Indians from the Service,
he was harmed in various ways and was thrown out of service
on flimsy grounds.

This evoked intense dissatisfaction and protest among
the educated middle class, not only of Calcutta but throughout
India. A strong opinion arose that an organized effort
should be made to arouse the self-respect which was wounded
by this act of the authorities and to launch an agitation for
securing the rights of Indians. Utilizing this opportunity
effectively, Banerji himself made a country-wide tour to
mobilize public opinion behind this issue. He visited several
places in the present Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Sind, Gujarat
and Maharashtra and cities of Delhi and Madras.

It can be said that this was the first attempt to mobilize
public opinion and to conduct an agitation. Quite naturally,
this agitation had the full co-operation of the Indian press.
Thus, the entire Indian language press became the voice of
public opinion strongly criticizing the government policies.
This annoyed the rulers who enforced a legislation to muzzle
the language press.

But despite these measures the agitation did not cool
down. On the other hand, this measure led to another
agitation. This agitation turned out to be effective in that
in 1882 the Government was force to rescind the Act which
was brought into force in 1878.

The Arms Act passed in 1878, the famines that broke
out in various parts of the country at the time, the pompous
celebrations of the jubilee of the reign of Queen Victoria
even in the midst of the famine, the war preparations made
in the North-West Frontier region and such other incidents
created dissatisfaction among the people. And the educated
middle class tried to organize agitations on each of these
issues. Lord Lytton, the then Governor-general, became the
target of the ire of the Indian people. Never before had the
Government taken such reprehensible measures as it did
during Lytton's time. The number of agitations organized
by popular leaders also was unprecedented. On the occasion
of his return to England after relinquishing the post, the
English newspaper, _Bengalee_, wrote: To Lord Lytton must
belong the credit of having done much by his repressive
measures towards stimulating the public life of this country,
and for this service certainly his Lordship will be entitled
to the gratitude of our country.

While these agitations in defence of the rights and demands
of the Indian people were going on, Englishmen in India
were also carrying on an agitation in their own way. Ilbert,
the then Law Member, had presented a bill in the Legislative
Council for removing the existing discrimination between
Englishmen and Indians in the Civil Service and to make
same provisions applicable to both the sections. Englishmen
who had been enjoying the privileges of racial domination,
organized a country-wide agitation against this legislative
measure. The newspapers run by them and the Indian
language newspapers run by Indians came into clash with
each other on the Ilbert Bill. In this conflict, the Englishmen
came out victorious --- the bill was passed with the amendments
demanded by them.

This cruelly wounded the self-respect of the Indian
people. It was a challenge to their patriotism and organizational
consciousness. The fact that the government which
was in power was one that not only disregarded their
legitimate agitations and the just demands raised through
these agitations, but also conceded the unjust demands raised
by the Englishmen was an eye-opener to them. Moreover, when
Surendranath Banerji, who was the principal character in the
incident which was considered to be the touchstone of the
goodwill of the rulers, was prosecuted, they came to realize
that there was no way left open before them other than that
of powerful agitations.

These developments led to the convening of a national
conference in December 1883 (28th to 30th) in Calcutta.
Even earlier, organizations like the British Indian Association
of Calcutta, the Sarvajanik Sabha of Poona, and the Mahajana
Sabha of Madras had been functioning in an organized
manner in their respective regions and had created the consciousness
of the need for unifying their activities. It was as a
result of several rounds of discussion held following this
realization that the first national conference was held in
Calcutta in 1883. This conference adopted resolutions raising
the demands of establishing representative assemblies of the
people, development of facilities for general and technical
education, separation of judiciary from the executive, entry of
Indians in government services and such other matters. It is
needless to say that this constituted a counter-move to the
agitation by the Englishmen against the Ilbert Bill.

Following this, Surendranath Banerji undertook another
tour of North India. The need for the unification of various
political groups in different regions and for the establishment
of a centralized organization was emphasized by him and
other leaders. The formation of the _Indian National Congress_
in 1885 was the result of these efforts.
