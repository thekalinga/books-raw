# INDEPENDENCE: VICTORY OR DEFEAT?

## THE SCHEME OF PARTITION

Mountbatten was sworn in as Viceroy as 24th March 1947.
For more than a month after taking office, he held separate
discussions with leaders of the various political parties,
analyzed their opinions and communicated his conclusions
to the British government in early May. Based on an amended
version of Mountbatten's report, on 3rd June, the British
government made an announcement which formed the basis
for the establishment of two independent sovereign countries,
India and Pakistan, on 15th August 1947.

Based on a vast body of documents comprising notes
and letters giving the details of the discussions which Mountbatten
had held with Indian leaders in this brief period,
many books have been written, some of which, like _Freedom at
Midnight_, have been highly controversial. At any rate, these
documents indicated that the question being discussed at
that stage was not whether India should be divided or not,
but how should India be divided.

The Congress demanded that, like India, the provinces
of Punjab and Bengal should also be divided and the _League_
demanded division of Assam also. The _Akalis_, on the other
hand, wanted a separate Sikh state comprising areas in both
wings of Punjab. Different sections put forward different
proposals in this manner before the Viceroy.

Top leaders of the Congress which was supposed to
oppose partition, like Nehru, Patel, Rajagopalachari, Rajendra
Prasad, Azad and Kripalani, proposed, though individually,
in one voice to the Viceroy that since the partition
of India had become inevitable, the Hindu majority areas
of Punjab and Bengal should not be included in Pakistan.
Jinnah, on the other hand, argued that these two provinces
should "wholesale" become part of Pakistan. If there
was justification in the demand for the division of India,
what was unjust in the demand for the division of Punjab
and Bengal? Jinnah had no answer to this question. He requested
Mountbatten not to render Pakistan unviable. At the
same time, he insisted on the point that the Muslims must
get a separate state, however small and weak it might be.
His only request now was that like Punjab and Bengal, the
Muslim majority areas of Assam should be made part of
Pakistan.

These discussions revealed one thing which is of importance
for students of the history of _freedom struggle_. This
was the fact that Gandhi, the undisputed and supreme leader
of the Congress for over a quarter of a century remained
isolated from his colleagues. Pyarelal, a close associate and
secretary of Gandhi, has described an incident which revealed
his state of mind in those days. Pyarelal writes:

>On...the 1st June (1947), mistaking the hands of his
watch, he (Gandhi) woke up earlier than usual. As there
was still half an hour before prayer, he remained lying in
bed and began to muse in a low voice: "The purity of my
striving will be put to test only now. Today I find myself
alone. Even the Sardar and Jawaharlal think that my reading
of the situation is wrong and peace is sure to return if
partition is agreed upon. ... They did not like my telling
the Viceroy that even if there was to be a partition, it
should not be through British intervention or under the
British rule. ... They wonder if I have not deteriorated
with age. Nevertheless, I must speak as I feel. ... I see
clearly that we are setting about this business the wrong
way. We may not feel the full effect immediately, but I
can see clearly that the future of independence gained at
this price is going to be dark.[^32/1]

In the midst of spreading the message of communal
amity in Bihar, Gandhi reached Delhi on the invitation of
Mountbatten. In his first interview with the Viceroy, Gandhi
repeated his earlier suggestion to hand over power to a
new government headed by Jinnah in order to solve the
complex communal problems. This suggestion, however, was
not acceptable to Nehru, Patel and other Congress leaders
who told the Viceroy that it was an impracticable proposal.
Nor was it acceptable to Jinnah who wished to establish a
separate state for the Muslims, and not to become the prime
minister of a Hindu majority country.

Meanwhile, a serious difference of opinion arose between
Jinnah and certain _League_ leaders in Bengal. The latter
thought that a separate undivided Bengal would be better
than dividing Bengal and presented this opinion before the
Viceroy. Reacting to this, Jinnah said that there was no
wonder if they did not like a Bengal without Calcutta. But
soon they gave up the position and favoured a Muslim Bengal
within Pakistan.

Thus, the Congress decided, unhappily though, to
divide India, and the _League_ to divide Punjab and Bengal.
The future of the Congress majority NWF Province and that
of the Muslim majority areas of Assam had to be determined.
Similarly, the choice of the personnel of the Indian armed
forces had to be made as to which country they would like
to go. Actions had to be taken to solve these problems
through mutual discussions. These and other matters were
contained in the 3rd June announcement of the British government.
We shall examine this and its repercussions in the next
section. Before that we have to find answers to a number of
questions. Specifically, why did Gandhi, the supreme leader
of the Congress for a quarter of a century, remained isolated?
Why did the _League_ leaders in Bengal try even at the last
moment to avoid the division of Bengal? Why did their
efforts fail?

The description of events and the social analysis we have
attempted to make in the earlier chapters based on these
events provide answers to these questions. Let us recapitulate.

The Indian _bourgeoisie_ which began to emerge in the
later half of the 19th century steadily gained strength in the 20th century. A Muslim section also gradually emerged within
the same class. The British tried to safeguard their own
interests making use of the competition and conflicts between
these two sections within the Indian _bourgeoisie_.

Thus, the Congress worked for the realization of the
demand of independence for the whole of India and the
_Muslim League_ for an independent Muslim state along
with Indian independence. The masses rallied themselves
behind both the sections of the _bourgeoisie_.

Gandhi's personality as well as the programme of
struggle he formulated were beneficial to the _bourgeoisie_ in
rallying the masses in the movement for India's independence.
Gandhi's method of struggle strengthened them enormously
in their efforts to bargain with the British on the economic
and political planes. The strict adherence to _non-violence_ in
Gandhi's method of struggle provided guarantee to the effect
that the _anti-British_ struggles of the people did not turn
against the interests of their (the _bourgeoisie_ and their feudal
allies) interests. Consequently, they were thrilled by the
leadership of Gandhi in the continuous struggles and negotiations.

The situation as a whole changed by 1946--47. As a
result of the struggles launched under the leadership of
Gandhi as well as the development that took place at the
international level, it appeared possible for the _bourgeoisie_
to establish their regime in India comprising at least the
Hindu majority regions and take the country along the path
of _Capitalism_ by utilizing the new political power that was
going to be acquired. It may be recalled that the leading
section of the _bourgeoisie_ had already formulated a plan,
known as the _Tata-Birla plan_, even before the end of the war.
The _bourgeoisie_ also had started entering the field of
international relations as evident from the _Asian Relations
Conference_ conceived by Nehru in 1945 and held at Delhi in
March-April 1947. In the circumstances, it was unthinkable
for the _bourgeoisie_ to launch another national struggle to win
freedom maintaining the integrity of India as proposed by
Gandhi. Thus, the Indian _bourgeoisie_ ignored Gandhi, the
'impractical dreamer' and stood firm behind the _Nehru-Patel_
wing of the leadership handling 'practical politics'.

It was during the wartime that the Muslim _bourgeoisie_
achieved the most notable development. Calcutta was one of
their principal strongholds. As a Bengal, and for that matter
a Pakistan, without Calcutta was unthinkable for them, they
made a last minute attempt to retain a united undivided
Bengal comprising the Hindu majority west and the Muslim
majority east, Jinnah who understood this 'sentiment' did not
stand in their way, either.

But the campaign of 'two-nations theory' launched throughout
the country for about a decade and the communal riots
that followed had altered the very thought processes of the
people belonging to the two communities. Although an undivided
Bengal had continued to remain a dream for the Calcutta-based
Muslim _bourgeoisie_, ordinary Muslims throughout
the eastern part of Bengal including Calcutta had started
thinking in terms of forming Pakistan even with a divided
Bengal.

It is interesting to note that the leader of the _Congress
Parliamentary Party_, Kiron Sankar Roy, had lent support to
the efforts of the _League_ leaders in Bengal to maintain the
unity of Bengal. Thus, when he had held discussions with
the Viceroy the proposal of undivided Bengal had the support
of both the ruling and opposition parties in the Bengal legislature.
On further discussing the proposal with his colleagues
after his return to Calcutta, he realized that the idea was
not going to work. Thereupon, the idea of an undivided
Bengal was abandoned.

Whatever the differences in details, the contents of all
the proposals initiated by the British government from the 1942 Cripps proposals to the 1947 Mountbatten Plan were
the same. The essence of all these proposals was that power
would not be transferred exclusively to the Congress and
that if the Congress was prepared to accept a Central government
to the satisfaction of the _League_, and agreed to partition
India under its aegis, it would obtain power; otherwise
independence would be postponed indefinitely.

The Congress was not prepared to accept this position
in 1942. But after five years it became eager to accept it and
to get hold of power. All the Congress leaders except Gandhi
were united on this issue, leaving Gandhi a solitary traveller.

## THE SURGICAL OPERATION

The three sides, the British rulers, the Congress and the
_League_, which took part in formulating the scheme of partition
tried to justify their action by comparing the partition
of India with a surgery performed on a patient who would
have died otherwise.

Whatever the cause, the Hindus and the Muslims had
become two communities unwilling to live together. If India
had to be maintained undivided in such a condition, the
Hindus had to reconcile to the reality of power passing to the
Muslims in some provinces, and the Muslims to the reality of
power passing to the governments under the control of the
Hindus in other provinces and at the Centre. In both the
Hindu and Muslim majority regions there should be governments
striving to run the administration consciously above
communal considerations.

A situation had now come to prevail under which none
of these was possible. The relation between the communities
had become one of tension and mutual annihilation. Nehru,
Mountbatten and all others concerned recognized the disease
for which there was no remedy other than surgery. Besides,
once surgery had become inevitable, it had to be performed
as early as possible. Accordingly, the British decided to
advance the date of departure to 15th August 1947 from
June 1948 as announced earlier. It was also decided that
power would now be handed over not to the leaders of undivided
India but to the leaders of India and Pakistan.
Servicemen in the military and police forces, members of the
civil service and other government employees would be given
the opportunity to opt for India or Pakistan. The assets and
liabilities of undivided India would be equitably divided between
India and Pakistan. Arrangements were made to work
out the details of partition at the official level and at the ministerial
level to superintend the work. With all these arrangements
it was expected that the process of partition would
proceed peacefully and amicably.

But the result was the other way round. 15th August
which should have been illuminated with the bright light of
independence was darkened by the shadow of the communal
riots. It was the day on which Gandhi, the 'commander-in-chief'
of the _freedom struggle_ was afflicted with deep sorrow.

The main points of the announcement made by the
British government on 3rd June with the approval of the
Congress and the _League_ are as follows.

>1. Although the representatives from the provinces of
>Madras, Bombay, United Provinces, Bihar, the Central
>Provinces, Berar, Assam, Orissa and the NWF Province as
>well as those from Delhi, Ajmer-Mewar and Coorg had
>been participating in the existing _Constituent Assembly_, a
>majority of the representatives from Bengal, Punjab, Sind
>and Baluchistan and the _League_ members from other provinces
>were not participating in the Assembly. As such, it had
>to be decided whether the existing _Constituent Assembly_
>should continue and whether there should be a separate
>_Constituent Assembly_ consisting of the representatives of
>those provinces, who had kept away from the existing Constituent
>Assembly.
>2. In the NWF Province from which a majority of
>the representatives had been participating in the existing
>_Constituent Assembly_ and in the Sylhet district of Assam
>contiguous to Bengal, a referendum would be held to determine
>whether they would like to join India or Pakistan.
>3. Members of the provincial Legislative Assemblies
>from the Muslim majority districts of Bengal and Punjab
>would meet separately to decide which country they would
>like to join.
>4. The members of the provincial Legislative Assembly
>of Sind would decide which state to join.
>5. Appropriate actions would be taken by the Viceroy
>to enable Baluchistan to make a choice.
>6. The above provisions apply only to the 'British
>Indian' territories and not to the Indian States'. In the
>event of the British leaving the country, the princes who
>had been ruling these states in accordance with the treaties
>with the British government, would have the right to decide
>their future. All the earlier declarations in this regard would
>remain in force.

The whole scheme appeared to Gandhi, Nehru and
other Congress leaders as Balkanizing the country, and they
were deeply disturbed by it. The reaction of Nehru to the
first draft of the scheme was unfavourable. But he found
no alternative to it. Thus, the final version of the scheme
had his approval.

Gandhi had opposed the scheme at every stage. He
thought that the surgery, rather than saving the life of the
patient would kill him. The difference between him and the
Congress reached its full form.

The full meaning of the surgery started becoming clear
as the arrangements to implement the scheme were in progress.
Not only India, but also the three provinces of Punjab, Bengal
and Assam were going to be partitioned. Not only the people
in these provinces but also in all other provinces, who had
been living together, speaking the same language, sharing
the same culture and traditions in every village and town
were going to become the citizens of two different countries.
Where should they stand? Should they leave their village or
town where they had been living for generations and settle
down in unknown villages and towns of another country?
Should they regard their friends bound by family and social
relations enemies just because they happened to hold
faith in another religion and choose a new place and a set of
new friends with whom they have no relation except that of
religion ? These and similar other questions arose before
several thousands of families and individuals.

We might feel that there is no justification for thinking
in these terms and that it is completely illogical. If a country
is divided politically and administratively into two, is there
a need for the people in one part to leave their homes and go
to the other part immediately after the division? Is it not
absurd and unjust to insist that just because Pakistan
has been formed, the non-Muslim in Pakistan must necessarily
go the Indian Union and the Muslims in the Indian
Union to Pakistan? Can't the Hindus in Pakistan and the
Muslims in the Indian Union continue to live as citizens in
their respective countries ?

However, there had emerged in India a situation under
which these questions were irrelevant. A situation under
which the Hindus and Muslims considered each other enemies
had already come to exist in the country. The _Muslim League_
had already formulated the 'two-nations theory' to provide
a theoretical basis for the emergence of this situation. The
Congress which had been opposing this theory, on the other
hand, had reflections of certain elements of Hindu communalism.

Besides, certain organizations like the RSS arguing
that India was a Hindu nation and that the non-Hindus in
India should be 'Indianized', had been fomenting communal
riots. The instigators of riots had been encouraged by the
British rulers and had been receiving assistance from the
vested interests in India.

It was in the soil fertile for the growth of communalism
that the British rulers, the Congress and the _League_ jointly
decided to sow the seeds of partition. This made the Hindus
and Sikhs in the Muslim majority provinces feel extremely
anxious. The conditions of the Muslims in the Hindu
majority provinces also were bad. The religious fanatics
and their organizations on both sides subjected the people
belonging to the minority communities who wanted to live in
their own country to cruelties unheard-of in normal times.
Government officials and ordinary employees who were
expected to protect the people from such acts began to
function keeping communal considerations in mind.

This was an indication to the new stage of the communal
riots which started with the observation of the _direct action_
day' on 16th August 1946 with the connivance of the _League_
government in Bengal as well as the British authorities and
subsequently spread to Noakhali and Bihar. The political conflicts
that took place at the higher level during and after the
formation of the interim government provided strength and
extent to the communal riots at the lower level. The Congress
gave approval to Indian partition and to the partition
of Punjab and Bengal thinking that this 'surgery' would help
to end this situation and to restore the peace.

But the decision to partition and the news that the
Congress and the _League_ gave approval to it brought about
a situation quite contrary to this optimism. As it became
clear that India would be partitioned soon and along with it
the provinces of Punjab, Bengal and Assam, the people who
were going to be directly affected by it started feeling agitated.
Their emotion began to ferment. For them, the Mountbatten
plan was not a document of detached theoretical
interest; it was rather a life issue that puts upside down all
their personal and family relationships. The feelings of
each of them merged together to form two parallel streams
of emotion: Hindu and Muslim. As an inevitable result
of it, in the days immediately preceding and following 15th
August, hundreds of thousands of people left their homes
and moved to the neighbouring country as refugees. Taking
whichever mode of transportation available and carrying
whatever domestic effects and other possessions they could
collect in hands, people fled form Pakistan to India and vice
versa. On the way many were killed at the hands of religious
fanatics and many of those escaped murder lost all their
possessions and turned destitute. Women were forcibly
carried away and molested and turned victims of forced
conversion and marriage. The surgery was performed in this
manner on hundreds and thousands of people and families.

It was in this background that the two independent
countries, Indian Union and Pakistan, emerged at the stroke
of midnight of 14th-15th August 1947. The suggestion came
up that there should be a common Governor-General for the
new countries and that it should be Lord Mountbatten. The
most enthusiastic support to this suggestion came from
Nehru, the most radical leader of the Congress which was
regarded as more '_anti-imperialist_' than the _League_. But the
suggestion was turned down by Jinnah and the _League_. The
_League_ emphatically stated that the head of their state should
be their _Qaid-e-Azam_ (Jinnah).

Thus, Lord Mountbatten who left for Karachi to administer
the swearing in ceremony of Jinnah as the Governor-General
of Pakistan returned to Delhi after the ceremony
and administered the swearing in ceremony of Nehru as
the first Prime Minister of free India.

While the swearing in ceremonies where taking place,
the worst kind of man-hunt human history has ever witnessed
was going on all over the country. The freedom fighters,
(except Gandhi and his close associates) accepted these tragic
events as inevitable in the circumstances that led to the emergence
of the Indian Union and Pakistan.

## LEADERS OF _FREEDOM STRUGGLE_ IN POWER

On 15th August 1947, the Union Jack was removed
from the Red Fort of Delhi and in its place was hoisted the
national flag of India. Jawaharlal Nehru was sworn in as
the first Prime Minister of India. Millions of Indian people
regarded the event as the realization of their long-standing
dream. They welcomed it with great delight.

But away from these joyous celebrations was _Mahatma
Gandhi_ working for the re-establishment of peace in Calcutta,
the centre of communal riots. No one in India could have
ever imagined an _Independence Day_ celebration without
his participation. He was, however, not in a state of mind
to participate in these celebrations. To a reporter who
approached him and sought for a message to the Indian people,
he told: "My heart has dried up."

The mass killings that took place immediately before 15th August on either wing of the country disappointed him.
He had been led by the conviction that the freedom obtained
in this background was not genuine. He decided
to devote the rest of his life to liberate the people of
both India and Pakistan from the brutal emotions which
led to this situation. He celebrated _Independence Day_ with
fasting, prayer and the recital of _Gita_. Congress President
Kripalani stated:

>Thousands of people had lost their all
including their relatives and friends and no adequate arrangements
could be made for the rehabilitation of those who
had survived. I had on August 14, 1947, issued a statement
in Calcutta in which I had said that "it was a day of sorrow
and destruction for India'.[^32/2]

[^32/2]: JB Kripalani, _op. cit_, p. 291.

But the communal riot and its disastrous consequences
were not the only thing which pained Gandhi and other leaders
like Kripalani. In the words of Kripalani:

>There were
also growing differences between Jawaharlal and Sardar
Patel. The Sardar and Maulana Azad were also not pulling
on well with each other. To add to these difficulties, the
country was suffering from a food crisis. The controls which
had continued after the end of the war were not working
satisfactorily. Further, there were during this time reports of
rivalry for positions of power amongst _Congressmen_ and
corruption in the administration. Gandhiji's words carried
little weight with the leaders. Partition had not brought
peace to the country.[^32/3]

[^32/3]: _Ibid_, 296.

Indications to this had already started appearing even
before Independence. For example, after the 1945 elections
Gandhi had proposed Rajagopalachari for the chief ministership
of Madras. But the decision in accordance with it could
not be carried out. Finally, Gandhi himself had to submit
to the decision to make T Prakasam the Chief Minister.
But on account of the infighting, the Prakasam ministry
did not survive for more than a year. We have already
referred to the rivalry between Nehru and Patel which had
started immediately before the formation of the interim
government at the Centre. However, it had not come out
openly till the end of the negotiations between the British
government and Jinnah. By 15th August, this rivalry began
to get sharper.

But there was absolutely no difference of opinion either
between Nehru and Patel or between them and Azad on the
question of the primacy of administration over organization.
Later, this became sharper in the form of frictions and
conflicts between the administrative and organizational wings
of the Congress. This has been described by JB Kripalani
who was the Congress President at the time of transfer
of power, as follows:

>My position as Congress President was embarrassing. The
leaders in the Government took important decisions without
consulting me or the _Working Committee_ of which they
were important members and wherein the opinions would
have prevailed. ... In one meeting of the _Working Committee_
Jawaharlal said, "The historical role of the Congress
is finished with independence." My reply was: 'Then your
Government will hang in the mid-air'. I was not called to
the conference where the draft of the Independence Bill,
to be passed by the British Parliament, was discussed.
I did not like to lower the status which had been occupied
before me by the most distinguished patriots of the
country..."[^32/4]

[^32/4]: _Ibid_, pp. 296--297.

Thus, Kripalani resigned the presidentship of the Congress.
He stated that he wrote a letter giving the reason for
his resignation, which were approved by Gandhi as genuine.
In other words, the approach adopted by the organizational
wing of the Congress against the administrative wing had
the general approval of Gandhi.

Another incident which Kripalani has cited is noteworthy.
He states:

>Jawaharlal and the Sardar then approached
Rajendra Babu to resign his Food portfolio in the Interim
Government and take up the work of the Congress. Rajendra
Babu did not approve of this idea. He went to consult Gandhiji.
He was against his leaving the portfolio of Food and Agriculture. ...
However, Jawaharlal and Vallabhbhai ultimately
prevailed upon him to become the Congress President. In
the final decision that Rajendra Babu took, he had not consulted
Gandhiji.[^32/5]

[^32/5]: _Ibid_, p. 297.

Gandhi had been disturbed by the feeling that most of
his trusted followers were moving away from him. Besides,
as the Congress which was a fighting organization became the
ruling party, its activists at all levels started falling victim
to power-hunger, arrogance, selfishness and other evil habits.
Considering all this, Gandhi proposed to disband the _Indian
National Congress_ as a political organization and "flower
into a _Lok Seva Sangh_", an instrument for serving the people
above politics. Since there were many groups among the Congress
leaders with distinct views and perspectives, let each of
them form a political party in accordance with its views and
perspective --- this was what he had suggested to the Congress
leaders. He thought that if the Congress transformed itself
into an organization for service to the people, the entire
political atmosphere in India would change. Accordingly,
Gandhi prepared a draft constitution for the Congress to
convert it into a _Lok Seva Sangh_.

Since the draft constitution was prepared a few hours
before Gandhi was assassinated, no action was taken in
pursuance of it. The Congress continued as a political party.
The conflicts and competition between the administrative
(ministerial) wing and the organizational wing and between
the leaders belonging to these wings became sharper. Certain
sections among the different groups within the Congress at
times even came close to the forces of Opposition. A description
of the consequences of these developments is, however,
beyond the scope of the present volume.

However, it must be indicated here that, as pointed out
by Gandhi and many other Congress leaders including
Kripalani, the assumption of power by the leaders who had
been in the forefront of the _freedom struggle_ had changed the
nature of Indian politics. The leaders who were looked
upon as symbols of service to the people turned themselves
into a group of people who considered their personal
interests above the interests of the country. The Congress
lost its tradition of service to the people which it had built
over a long period of struggle.

Gandhi and Kripalani could not examine these developments;
nor could they find a real answer to the question of why
such developments took place at all. An answer to this
question may be easily found if we examine, as we have
attempted to do in this volume, the emergence and growth
of the Congress in the light of _Historical Materialism_.

The constant economic and political progress achieved by
the Indian _bourgeoisie_ lay behind the emergence and growth of
the Congress. The objective of this class was the achievement
of political power and continued development of _Capitalism_.
Once the objective was achieved, with limitations though,
the ideals which had been leading the political representatives
of this class in the struggles to achieve the objective disappeared.
In place of these ideals, selfishness characteristic of
capitalist society --- filling one's own pocket by exploiting the
people and competing with each other for the purpose --- came
out in naked forms.

Leaders like Gandhi who continued to uphold the old
ideals to a great extent even at this stage expressed dissent
to the policies of their colleagues and began to move along
their own path.

It must be noted here that Gandhi, despite the disagreements,
never opposed publicly the decisions taken by
the leaders working in the administration of the country.
Although Gandhi was fundamentally opposed to all the
schemes, including those of Wavell, the _Cabinet Mission_
and Mountbatten, he never came forward to organize the
masses against them. If the people had known generally
that Gandhi was opposed to these schemes and if they had
been called upon by Gandhi to oppose them, the Mountbatten
Plan would not have come into force so easily.

In other words, the British plan with regard to the
division of India as well as the communal riots which broke
out raised a number of complex questions before the non-Muslim
_bourgeoisie_ represented by the Congress: Was it
necessary to acquire power by giving approval to partitioning
India, or whether the struggle for freedom should be
continued without making compromise over the question of
partition? How to normalize the relations between India and
Pakistan at the state level and between the Hindus and Muslims
in the country after Independence?

Each of the top Congress leaders, including Gandhi, had
his own views on these problems. It was, in fact, the conflicts
among them that kept Gandhi away from other Congress
leaders. At the same time, despite the divergence in views,
all of them represented basically the same class interests.

Besides, the controversies between the Congress and
the _League_ had divided the people into the Hindu and
Muslim camps. The Hindu fanatics believed that the speeches
and activities of Gandhi who was disturbed by the frictions
and conflicts arising out of these controversies, were encouraging
the unjust claims of the Muslims. They openly gave
expressions to their feelings. There were reports to the effect
that Gandhi might fall victim to the physical attack of this
section.

There was a bomb attack on Gandhi's prayer meeting
ten days before he was assassinated. There were complaints
later that the ruling Congress leaders behaved thoroughly indifferently
without taking the incident seriously.

In any case, Gandhi was assassinated on 30th January 1948. With this ended the era which can be called "Gandhian"
in the history of Indian people.
