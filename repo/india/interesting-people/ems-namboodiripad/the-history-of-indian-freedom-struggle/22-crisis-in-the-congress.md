# CRISIS IN THE CONGRESS

## THE PRESIDENT

Subhas Bose who took over the Congress presidentship
from Nehru at the Haripura session, though known to be
a leftist like Nehru, never maintained personal relations with
Gandhi as Nehru had done. Besides, a person who had
been keeping relations with the four decade old revolutionary
movement in Bengal, Bose had not been able to reconcile himself
politically with Gandhi and the right-wing leadership led
by him. Consequently, a considerable section of the _Congressmen_
looked upon the circumstance that led to the election
of Bose to the presidentship with mixed feelings.

The reasons that motivated the leadership to install a
leftist leader as the president had not ceased to exist. Whatever
the nature of the collective leadership of the Congress,
a leftist president was absolutely essential for mobilizing
the masses enthusiastically for political action. The next
best person to serve this purpose was Bose. However, the
question arose whether Bose would submit himself to be tamed
by Gandhi and other right-wing leaders as Nehru did, or
whether contradictions and conflicts would develop between
them. In any case, the leadership felt that if a well-known
leftist leader from Bengal like Bose, who had spent a longer
period in jail than Nehru, was not made the president at
least for one term, it might create problems. Consequently,
Bose was elected president with the full backing of Gandhi.
In a statement issued on the occasion of his election, Bose
stated that as long as he remained the president he would
utilize that position to resist with all legal and legitimate means
the federal scheme which contained all undemocratic and
anti-national elements. He would utilize the presidency to
strengthen the determination of the country to fight against
the federal scheme by formulating, if necessary, a mass
resistance programme which would include _non-violent_ _non-cooperation_.

This was apparently no different from the statements
issued by the right-wing leaders for they also had been claiming
to prepare the people for a country-wide struggle
against the federal scheme. However, in this statement as
well as in his presidential address and other pronouncements
made later during his presidency, there was an overtone of
a determined _anti-British_ struggle, whereas in the approach
of the right-wing the slant was towards compromise. This
was, in fact, the basis of the split that surfaced a year later at
the Tripuri session.

Bitter controversies raged between the left-wing and
right-wing in the Congress during the year that intervened
between the Haripura and Tripuri sessions. The struggle
inside was so intense that there was even a walk out by the
leftist leaders led by Acharya Narendra Dev, a member of
the _Working Committee_, at an _AICC_ meeting held in September 1938. The attitude of the provincial Congress
ministries towards the peasant struggle which were going on
all over the country and the negative approach adopted by
Gandhi and other right-wing leaders towards the democratic
struggles of the people in the different _Princely States_ made
the leftists discontent and restive. On these and similar
other issues Bose stood firmly with the leftists.

The conflicts between the two wings reached an explosive
stage when the issue arose whether Bose should retire from
presidentship after the one year term or whether he should be
re-elected for a second as in the case of Nehru. The view became
wide-spread among the leftist _Congressmen_ that Gandhi
and other right-wing leaders were not determined enough
in organizing national resistance to the federal scheme. The
behind-the-scene moves initiated by leading capitalists like
Birla to bring a compromise between the Congress and the
British government were well known. It was widely felt that
Bose should continue as president if these moves were to be
stalled. Unlike Nehru, Bose was relentless in his opposition
to the right-wing leadership which made the leftists
rally behind him.

Bengal was one of the provinces where the feelings
against compromise were expressed in the strongest terms.
For example, the _Jalpaiguri District Conference_ of the Congress
in a resolution proposed rejection of the federal
scheme. The resolution also proposed that the British should
be given a six months notice and that after the expiration
of this period, a programme should be adopted to
launch a mass struggle including _civil disobedience_ and
strikes. Bose himself had expressed this opinion on many
occasions. An indication of this was also contained in the
statement he had issued after he was elected president of the
Congress at the Haripura session.

The Jalpaiguri resolution and Bose's statement were
reflections of the sentiment of ordinary _Congressmen_ in the
other provinces as well. The idea of launching a mass struggle
by mobilizing the people against the federal scheme had
exerted considerable influence among the people. Bose
appeared on the forefront as a powerful spokesman of this
idea.

The right-wing leadership was totally against this stand.
Consequently, they opposed tooth and nail the proposal to
re-elect Bose for a second term. When his candidature was
announced, they proposed Maulana Azad as their candidate
for the presidentship. They argued that with the deepening
political crisis and the Hindu-Muslim conflict in particular, a
venerable Muslim leader like Azad would be a better choice.
But Azad withdrew from the contest saying that it would do
more harm than good if he were to stand against Bose.
Following this, the right-wing leaders nominated Dr. Pattabhi
Sitaramayya as the presidential candidate.

In the fierce fight between the two, both sides used all
the weapons available. The sharpest weapon on the one side
was the leftist sentiment that a decisive battle had to be
waged against the British rulers serving them with a six
months ultimatum. The effective argument on the other side
was that for any such struggle to succeed, the mature and
seasoned leadership of Gandhi was essential. Thus, the
presidential context was between these two political views.

Bose was elected with a narrow majority. The election
which might be considered as a victory for the left over
the right led to the biggest crisis in the Congress since the
Surat session. In a statement issued soon after the election,
Gandhi owned Pattabhi's defeat as his own. He said:

>... since I was instrumental in inducing Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya
not to withdraw his name as a candidate when Maulana
Azad withdrew, the defeat is more mine than his."[^22/1]

[^22/1]: D.G. Tendulkar, _Mahatma_, Vol. 5, New Delhi, Publications Division, 1969, p. 32.

In this
statement Gandhi was indicating that if the leftists represented
by Bose gained upper hand in the Congress and a
struggle was launched under its auspices, he would not
participate in that struggle. The various statements and
counter-statements that followed contained numerous allegations
against each other. Soon the right-wing members in
the _Working Committee_ resigned bringing the activities of the
Congress at the top to a standstill.

Gandhi's anti-left attitude was well known since 1934
when he had resigned his primary membership in the Congress
stating that in case the Socialists gained ascendancy in the
Congress he would not like to remain in the organization. But
the _Congress Socialists_ and other leftists were a minority
then. The situation continued to be the same during the presidency
of Nehru. Nor was there any problem apparently
during the year in which Bose was made the president. But
in the confrontation that took place at the end of his presidency,
the right-wing which was working with the blessings
of Gandhi was defeated. Gandhi could not but hit back. This
was what he had started with the statement that Pattabhi's
defeat was his own.

Although the right-wing was defeated in the presidential
election, the left-wing had a serious weakness. Gandhi had
known what this weakness was. A considerable section of
the ordinary _Congressmen_ who shared the sentiments of a
relentless struggle also believed in the indispensability of
the leadership of Gandhi for victory in the struggle for
independence. To the ordinary _Congressmen_ Gandhi was the
only leader who inspired the masses and drew them into the
struggle. The experience of the Indian people had not so
far shown them that the path of mass revolution based on
the _Marxist-Leninist_ perspective was practical politics. Even
the ordinary _Congressmen_ who supported the line of uncompromising
struggle championed by Bose and other leftwing
leaders believed in the indispensability of Gandhi's
leadership. The statement made by Gandhi conceding defeat
in the presidential election was in fact the warning that these
would not go together and that if they wanted his leadership,
the programme advocated by Bose and others should be abandoned
and a president and a _Working Committee_ enjoying
his confidence must come to the leadership. The resignation
of the right-wing leaders declaring unwillingness to cooperate
with the president who was elected with a narrow margin of
votes was another form of the same warning.

Gandhi's statement and the resignation of the right-wing
leaders from the _Working Committee_ brought about a change
in the co-relation of right-left forces among the delegates.
Although a majority of the delegates to the Tripuri session
was with Bose at the time of the presidential election, most
delegates considered that Gandhi's leadership was indispensable.
Most delegates were under the spell of a psychological
conflict, a conflict between the feelings that the statement
and the resignations were designed to hound out Bose and
that the continuance of Bose as president should not be at the
cost of Gandhi's leadership.

Exploiting the state of mind of a majority of the
delegates, the right-wing leadership made a clever move. On
its behalf Govind Ballabh Pant introduced a resolution suggesting
that Bose continue as president and nominate the
members of the _Working Committee_ in consultation with
Gandhi. The rationale for raising this demand was mentioned
in the resolution:

>In view of the critical situation that may develop during
the coming year and in view of the fact that _Mahatma
Gandhi_ alone can lead the Congress and the country to
victory during such a crisis, the Congress regards it as imperative
that the Congress Executive should command his
implicit confidence. ... [^22/2]

[^22/2]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _The History of Indian National Congress_, Vol II,
Bombay, Padma Publications, 1947, p. 110.

The introduction of the resolution led to a lot of procedural
wrangle. Many incidents took place reminiscent of the
Surat session. Finally, the resolution was adopted, which
represented a greater victory for the right-wing than that of
the left-wing in the presidential election. The political
result of the Gandhi-Bose confrontation was that it belittled
the narrow victory of the leftists and carried the majority of
the ordinary _congressmen_ to stand behind Gandhi and other
right-wing leaders. Organizationally, Pant's resolution placed
the leftist president at the mercy of the right-wing leaders.
In other words, Gandhi and other right-wing Congress leaders
who were successful in taming Nehru took a major
step towards destroying the entire left movement by trouncing
Bose in a direct political-organizational fight. A few months
after this, they launched a fresh attack on the left.

## THE SWORD OF DISCIPLINE

The meaning of the resolution introduced by Pant and
adopted at the Tripuri session was that in return to his remaining
as the president, Bose should be prepared to nominate
a _Working Committee_ as proposed by Gandhi and
acceptable to the right-wing leadership. Bose and Gandhi could
not come to an agreement with regard to the implementation
of the resolution. Consequently, the entire Congress organization
remained paralyzed for several weeks after the
Tripuri session. This was a development which was not
anticipated by the delegates who elected him president. Seeing
no way out of the impasse, Bose tendered his resignation
and called a meeting of the _AICC_.

The _AICC_ session which was held in Calcutta to consider
the resignation of Bose and other related matters was
equally stormy. Since the right-wing had a big majority in the
_AICC_ there was no difficulty in accepting the resignation of
Bose and electing Rajendra Prasad as president in his place.
Thus, the election of the president by a majority of delegates
and the support to the left policy demonstrated in that
process were rejected by this action of the _AICC_.

The leftist outlook in the Congress and the reality of
its manifestation in the different forms could not be eliminated
by this organizational action alone. Just as the right-wing
political force was not wiped out by the election of Bose as
the president of the Congress, so the left political force was
not destroyed by the forced resignation of Bose from the
presidentship. Even after the resignation of Bose, popular
feelings rose high against the right oriented policies pursued by
the leadership in general and the anti-people measures of the
Congress ministries in particular. Workers' strikes, peasant
_satyagraha_ and other forms of _direct actions_ became widespread
all over the country, in which ordinary _Congressmen_
joined hands with Communists and _Congress Socialists_. In all
provinces numerous district and local Congress committees
and in certain provinces like Bengal, UP and Kerala even
the provincial committees actively participated in these mass
actions. These were, in fact, the expression of the anguish
of ordinary _Congressmen_ over the repressive actions being
resorted to by the Congress governments in which they
were little different from the _non-Congress_ governments. The
tactics adopted by the right-wing leadership in hounding out
a president who was elected by a majority also intensified
the protest of the Congress ranks.

In order to meet the new situation, the _AICC_ which met
in June 1939 at Bombay adopted two resolutions. One of these
resolutions was designed to prevent _Congressmen_ and lower
level Congress committees from going on agitations by putting
the restriction that "any movement or _Satyagraha_ for
any purpose should be run under the direction, control, and
superintendence of the _Provincial Congress Committees_". The
other resolution was intended to prevent open criticism of
the provincial Congress governments by the Congress Parliamentary
Parties or _Provincial Congress Committees_. The
resolution laid down that "in administrative matters, the PCC
should not interfere with the discretion of the Ministry, but
it is always open to the Executive of the PCC to draw the
attention of the Government to any particular abuse or
difficulty. ... In matters of policy if there is a difference
between the Ministry and the PCC reference should be made
to the _Parliamentary Board_. Public discussion should be
avoided."

These resolutions gave a clear indication to the direction
in which the right-wing leadership and the ministers under
their control were moving. The essence of these resolutions
is that since the Congress is in power in some of the provinces,
people in those provinces should not launch struggles, and
even if they did, _Congressmen_ should not participate in these
struggles and that even if an action of the governments is
found to be wrong, which causes the struggle, this should not
be stated publicly. In other words, the Congress committee
should function as an appendage of the Congress ministry.

There were certain political developments behind all
this. As Dr. Gopal, Nehru's biographer, has stated, the
British rulers were having a sort of honeymoon with the
right-wing _Congressmen_. The repressive policies adopted by
Rajagopalachari in Madras and Munshi in Bombay gave
tremendous satisfaction to the British rulers who began to
realize that if the Congress ministers, on being given the
power to rule at the provincial level, were prepared to "maintain
law and order" so satisfactorily, giving them power at
the Centre would in no way cause harm to their imperial
interests.

Feeling upset by the close relations between the Congress
and the British rulers, Jinnah began to make certain counter
moves. On the other hand, the suspicion spread among the
ranks of the Congress that the right-wing leaders were trying
to reach a compromise with the British rulers. What made
Subhas Bose the target of the ire of the right-wing Congress
leadership was that he gave a manifest form to this suspicion.
The charge openly made by Bose that the right-wing
leadership was trying to arrive at an understanding with the
British rulers. The criticism of the right-wing that this amounted
to questioning their honesty and the declaration that
they would not cooperate with Bose unless he withdrew the
charge --- all this led to the resignation of Bose from the presidentship
after being elected with a majority of votes.

The resolution adopted by the _AICC_ which met at
Bombay in this background came to be sharply criticized
by the leftists. The leftist coordination committee formed
by the _Congress Socialist Party_, the newly formed _Forward
Bloc_ under the leadership of Subhas Bose, the _Communist
Party_, the _Royist group_ and the _All-India Kisan Sabha_ called
upon the people to observe 9th July as a _Protest Day_ to
organize public opinion against the approach of the right-wing
which had taken a dangerous form as evident from these
resolutions. The _Protest Day_ was observed on a big scale
all over the country. It became evident that the actions of
the right-wing had brought the leftists closer. Sensing the
danger involved in the left unity, the right-wing leadership
decided to take 'strong actions'. The new president, Rajendra
Prasad, asked for an explanation for the 'breach of Congress
discipline' on the part of Bose. The reply given by
Bose throws light on the prevailing political situation as well
as on the main issues of dispute between the left-wing and
the right-wing in the Congress. The relevant parts of his
reply are quoted below:

>In the first place, one has to distinguish between protesting
>against a certain resolution and actually defying it or
>violating it. What has so far happened is that I have
>only protested against two resolutions of the _AICC_.
>
>It is my constitutional right to give expression to my opinion
>regarding any resolution passed by the _AICC_ when a
>particular session of that body that comes to a close. If
>you want _Congressmen_ the right to express their views on
>resolutions passed by the _AICC_ you cannot draw a line
>and say that only favourable opinions will be allowed expression
>and unfavourable will be banned. If we have
>the constitutional right to express our views, then it does
>not matter if those views are favourable or unfavourable.
>We have so long been fighting the British Government,
>among other things, for our Civil Liberty. Civil Liberty,
>I think, includes freedom of speech. According to your
>point of view, we are not to claim freedom of speech when

>or in the Congress. It would be a strange situation if we

[^22/3]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _The History of India National Congress_, Vol. II,
Bombay, Padma publications, 1947. pp. 116--117.

The right-wing leadership rejected all his contentions,
except the responsibility which he owned for the _protest day_.
Therefore, accepting the admission he had made that he was
the "arch-criminal", the _Working Committee_ decided to award
him an "exemplary punishment" of removing him from
presidentship of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee
and also disqualifying him from holding elective posts of
the Congress for a period of three years. Disciplinary actions
were also taken against many other leftist _Congressmen_ who
had taken part in the observance of the _protest day_.

The post-Tripuri situation must, in fact, be compared
with the post-Surat situation and not with the post-Gaya
situation as Bose has done, for the sharp differences that
surfaced in the Gaya session did not lead to a rupture in the
relation between the two groups which were existing at that
time. Rather, an unwritten agreement was reached between
the two allowing the _Swarajists_ to go their own way and their
opponents to function as they liked. In Surat and Tripuri,
on the other hand, there was not only a rupture but the right-wing
also took organizational actions in order to curb the
growing influence of the left-wing.

Besides, in the days about the Tripuri session, as was
the case with the Surat session, the right-wing in the Congress
had been making attempts to come to a settlement with the
British government. The main condition for the success of
such attempts was to expel the left-wing from the leadership,
if not from the organization. In Surat, Gokhale and Pherozeshah
Mehta came forward to face the 'extremists', thinking
that Tilak or Lajpat Rai becoming the president of the
Congress would be dangerous to their attempts. In the
Tripuri session and in the months following it, Gandhi and
his associates thought that continuance of Bose as president
would be dangerous and decided to remove him from the
presidentship.

Despite this similarity, there was a major difference
between the Surat and Tripuri sessions. As distinct from
the 'moderates' of the Surat days, the right-wing leadership
in the Tripuri days was a mature _bourgeois_ leadership having
gained the experience from rallying the millions around itself.
The leftists at the Tripuri session too were more experienced
than Tilak and his colleagues in leading mass struggles. So,
the dispute between the two wings was over the method and
the perspective of the final battle against the British rule.
There were two contending methods and perspectives: the _non-violent_
_civil disobedience_ struggles combined with non-payment
of taxes as proposed and demonstrated by Gandhi
and mass agitations including worker's strikes and peasant
actions combined with _civil disobedience_, non-payment of
taxes and other forms of struggles as proposed and put into
practice by the leftists. People in millions were rallied in
both the camps representing these methods. Both the groups
waged the struggles standing in the forefront of the people.

The disciplinary actions were taken against Bose and
other left-wing _Congressmen_ at a time it was not clear where
this struggle would reach and what forms it would take.
Within a month of the disciplinary action, in the first week
of September the Second World War broke out which completely
changed the political situation in the world, including
India. This made the right-left division as it continued for
the past more than a couple of years irrelevant. The relations
and co-relations prevailing in the country in general and in
the Congress in particular changed in a fundamental way.
Following this, the internal crisis in the Congress was resolved
temporarily. But new problems emerged inside and outside
the Congress which assumed news forms.

## _COMMUNIST PARTY_ AND LEFT FORCES

Although the _Communist Party_, the _Congress Socialist
Party_, the _Forward Bloc_, the _Royist group_ and the _Kisan
Sabha_ were united in general in the fight against the policies
of the right-wing leadership of the Congress, there were differences
among them on a number of fundamental issues.
These agreements and disagreements had played a significant
role in the progress of the independence movement as well
as in the post-independence political developments in India.

Among these organizations the _Communist Party_ alone
had possessed the greatest ideological clarity and organized
style of work. This quality of the Party has been referred to
earlier while dealing with its development at the different stages.
In particular, we have shown that, apart from the infantile
disorders common to all political parties and organizations,
the severe repressions let loose by the British imperialism on
the Communists as part of its opposition to the world Communist
movement had stood in the way of forming and
fostering a _Communist Party_ in India. The _Communist Party_
was finally reorganized in the year 1933--1934. In other
words, a stable _Communist Party_ was established in India in
the 1930's as part of the new _anti-imperialist_ upswing witness
in this period.

But as distinct from other left parties, the _Communist
Party_ has an international outlook of its own. It is a Party
which is striving to create a revolutionary movement by rallying
the entire masses under the leadership of the working
class in India as has been done in other countries following
the victorious October Socialist Revolution in Russia. The
Party, as part of the _Communist International_, was striving
to consolidate the leadership of the working class in the _anti-imperialist_
movement in India and to rally the peasantry and
other working masses against the policies of the _bourgeois_
leadership. This is what distinguishes the _Communist Party_
from all other left parties.

We have mentioned earlier the services of MN Roy in
the early years of the development of the Communist movement
in India. But Roy after being expelled from the _Communist
International_ and his _Radical Democratic Party_ began to
work in a manner hostile to the _Communist Party of India_.
This brought Roy to opportunist politics in the later
years. But, this political group was part of the left movement
in the second half of the 1932's. In those years the phraseology
and style of functioning of his group appeared to be in keeping
with the traditions of the _Communist International_.

The attitude adopted by the leaders of the _Congress
Socialist Party_ was different from that of these two organizations.
As pointed out earlier, it had its origin in the efforts
made to give an organized form to the 'extremist' views that
had begun to emerge within the Congress. Consequently, it
possessed a characteristic which was absent in the _Communist
Party_ and the _Royist group_. This characteristic was the
stipulation that anyone who wished to be a member of the
_Congress Socialist Party_ must be a member of the Congress.
The leaders of the _Congress Socialist Party_ thought that theirs
was a party of the left-wing in the Congress.

The _Communist Party_ and the _Royist group_, on the
other hand, were non-Congress Parties which were striving
to organize the masses against the _bourgeois_ leadership of
the Congress. The _Royist group_ had never given up the
Communist outlook that the right-wing leadership of the
Congress was, from the class point of view, the leadership
of the _bourgeoisie_. The _Congress Socialist Party_ had never
accepted this position.

At the international level, there was an organization
called the _Socialist International_ parallel to and opposing the
_Communist International_ in ideology and in practical politics.
This was the continuation of the _Second International_ which
was working on the basis of class collaboration as against
the working class revolutionary outlook represented by Lenin
in the world working class revolutionary movement. The
outlook of the _British Labour Party_ which had some connection
with the Indian national movement and which had
come to power twice in England, was that of the _Second
International_. Its ideological influence held sway over the
leadership of the _Congress Socialist Party_ as also some other
sections of the Indian nationalists. It reflected itself in the attitude
of the leadership of the _Congress Socialist Party_ towards
the world Communist movement, the Soviet Union and the
_Communist Party of India_. It publicized in India the _antiCommunist_
and _anti-Soviet_ slanders fabricated by the enemies
of Communism, in which the Party's Joint Secretary
MR Masani, the editor of the Party journal Ashoka Mehta
and Dr. Rammanohar Lohia were prominent. Consequently,
this group of the _Congress Socialist_ leadership was inimical
to the _Communist Party_.

The political developments that took place at the national
and international levels in the later half of the 1930's were
such that this hostility to Communism was not likely to cut
much ice. European fascism which started in Mussolini's Italy
and spread to Hitler's Germany and the Japanese militarism
which was striving to conquer the entire Asia were growing as
a big threat to world democratic movement. The possibility of
a global war breaking out if this aggressive tendency was
not contained shocked the people.

Efforts were going on at the international level to build
a fighting front against fascist aggression, in which the
different national organizations in India, including the Congress,
were actively participating. In particular, India made
practical contributions to the heroic battles being waged
against the fascist forces. Nehru's visit to Spain and the Indian
medical mission led by Dr. Kotnis sent to China were
examples.

The _Communist International_ was in the forefront of
this world _anti-fascist_ upsurge. The _anti-fascist_ call given
by Dimitrov who took over the leadership of the _Communist
International_ after being released from the Hitlerite prison in
Germany, reverberated the whole world. Responding to this
call, Communists all over the world were striving to forge
unity among the _anti-fascist_, anti-war democrats in their respective
countries. As an impact of these developments,
Communists in India engaged themselves in uniting all the
_anti-imperialist_ organizations and movements including the
Congress. They came to the fore as the most effective
propagandists of the _anti-imperialist_ programme formulated
at the _Lucknow Congress_ and in the following years.

The leadership of the _Congress Socialists_ could not
ignore this. The anti-Communism which the Masani & co
tried to display in the national and international politics as a
result of its relationship with the _bourgeois_ leadership of
the Congress at home and the influence of the _Socialist International_
abroad, failed to be effective. On the contrary, the
_Congress Socialist_ leaders like Jayaprakash Narayan were
of the opinion that _Congress Socialist Party_ and the _Communist
Party_ should not only unite with each other but also
should build a joint front. This was the basis of the left
unity mentioned earlier.

This united action helped to bring certain changes in the
_Congress Socialist Party_. A section of the members of the
_Congress Socialist Party_ and even a section of its leadership
gave up anti-Communism and _anti-sovietism_, and analyzing
the right-wing leadership on the class basis, began to perceive
the _bourgeois_ nature of its leadership. They gradually transformed
themselves into Communists. The present author is
one among them. The same change took place among the
leadership and ranks of the _Congress Socialist Party_ in Kerala.
Thus, after a few years the entire _Congress Socialist Party_
of Kerala transformed itself into the _Communist Party_.
Things moved in the same direction in many other parts of
the country. Thus, the cooperation between the _Congress
Socialist_ and Communist parties led to the growth of the
_Communist Party_.

This enhanced the influence of the _anti-Communist_
group of Masani in the leadership of the _Congress Socialist
Party_. They failed to appreciate the fact that this political
change was the natural result of joint action and constant
exchange of views. Appreciating it would amount to admitting
one's own political weakness! So they carried out an
extensive propaganda that this was the result of a 'Communist
conspiracy'. At the same time they would claim that the
earlier transformation of a section of _Congressmen_ into
_Congress Socialists_ was not the result of a _Congress Socialist_
Conspiracy but the result of political experience and
exchange of views. They failed to appreciate the role of a
similar political process in the transformation of _Congress
Socialists_ into Communists.

Consequently, many prominent _Congress Socialists_
including Jayaprakash Narayan who earlier took the initiative
to forge political unity with the Communists and who
declared at the _Meerut conference_ that their objective was
Marxism and not merely Socialism, capitulated to the new
_anti-Communist_ attack. This process reached its culmination
after the outbreak of the Second World War. But the attack
on the Communists inside the _Congress Socialist Party_ had
started long back.

The 1939 Congress presidential election and the subsequent
events took place in the political atmosphere in
which the _Congress Socialists_ and Communists were jointly
building the _anti-imperialist_ front on the one side and engaged
in political conflicts between each other on the other. The
protest demonstration of 9th July and the disciplinary action
taken by the right-wing Congress leadership against Bose and
other left-wing Congress leaders resulted in the emergence
of a new leftist party distinct from these parties. _Forward
Bloc_ did not subscribe to Marxism-Leninism or even to the
right-wing Socialism. It was merely based on left-wing
nationalism. The common outlook of an _anti-imperialist_
struggle linked the _Forward Bloc_ with the other three left
parties, but it lacked the outlook of workers and peasants
struggle which was shared by the latter. Its leaders visualized
mass struggles mainly based on the middle-classes.

On the issue of International politics also the _Forward
Bloc_ held views which were different from that of the rest
of the left parties. The latter parties were striving to unite
the revolutionary forces all over the world against fascism
and war. The _Forward Bloc_, on the other hand, was striving
to develop friendly relations with the world fascist and militarist
forces thinking that the British imperialism was its
sole enemy. They were viewing the national and international
politics on the basis of the principle that "one's enemy's
enemy is one's friend". And this was exactly what led Bose
to Germany and Japan during the war.

The attitude of Nehru was just the opposite. He was close
to Communists in viewing world politics and Indian politics
which was a part of it. He was also closer to Communists in
holding the outlook of an _anti-imperialist_ front by unifying
all _anti-imperialist_ and _anti-fascist_ forces in India and converting
the Congress as the platform of such a front in
which the fighting organizations of workers and peasants
had a significant role to play. But unlike the Communists
and Socialists, he was not prepared to clash with the right-wing
leadership of the Congress on the issue of this _anti-imperialist_
front. He, in fact, began to engage himself in the
world politics as a means to escape form the internal conflicts
that surfaced in the Congress before and after the Tripuri
session. Nehru's biographer states:

>The national movement
was in a reverse gear and at Haripura. Subhas Bose had taken
over the Congress presidency. Jawaharlal was pressed hard
to become the general secretary but refused. He had even
wished to step out of the _Working Committee_. He had been
prevailed upon not to do so, but his interest was elsewhere,
and in June, gleefully turning his back on India, he sailed
for what to him were the vital centres of activity in Europe.[^22/4]

[^22/4]: S. Gopal, _op. cit_, p. 233.

It will be rewarding to compare the roles played by
Nehru and Bose in the independence struggle and in the Congress
organization. Even after 1938--1939 Bose held the logic
of 'enemy's enemy', no matter it was fascism. For him, the
imminent world war was an opportunity to liberate India.
There would be no pricks of conscience for him even in
accepting the assistance from the fascist forces for that purpose.

Nehru, on the other hand, considered fascism and
British imperialism as twin brothers. He could not even imagine
opposing imperialism with the assistance of fascism. Nor
could he think of accommodating British imperialism on the
pretext of preventing the advance of the fascist powers.
Apart from this, Nehru and Bose were poles apart in their
approach towards the right-wing leadership of the Congress,
especially towards Gandhi.

The activists of the _Kisan Sabha_ included people who
were holding all these views and outlooks. Consequently,
there is nothing to mention particularly about its character.
Suffice it to say that the inclusion of this organization which
was organizing the peasantry against the landownership systems
like the _Zamindari_, etc., added to the strength of the
left forces in the _anti-imperialist_ front.
