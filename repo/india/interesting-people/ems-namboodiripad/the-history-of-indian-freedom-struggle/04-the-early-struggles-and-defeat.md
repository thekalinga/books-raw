# THE EARLY STRUGGLES AND DEFEATS

## REVOLTS IN SOUTH INDIA

The series of revolts which broke out in 1857 in North
India and lasted nearly two years were India's "first struggle
for independence". Till the nationalist research scholars
started to gather facts and evaluate this struggle, it was known
as the "_Sepoy Mutiny_", the name given by the British. It was,
in fact, not a "_Sepoy Mutiny_", but a magnificent form of
_people's struggle_. The _Sepoys_, of course, played a prominent
role in that struggle. This has now been widely accepted.

However, about half a century prior to this mass upsurge,
South India had witnessed another revolt. Nationalist historians
have now brought to light certain facts relating to
some clashes which formed part of that revolt and
about the valiant patriots who played a leading role in them.
Apart from these isolated and sporadic armed revolts,
however, South India did not witness a _freedom struggle_ as
organized and as sweeping as the 1857--59 struggle of Northern
India until recently.

As part of the centenary celebrations of the 1857--59
struggle for independence, several studies were carried out
by eminent scholars on the _history of the freedom movement
in India_, under the direction of the former Union Minister
of Education, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. This gave an
impetus to a number of scholars and students of history to
conduct studies and research into the history of the various
struggles for independence in different parts of India. One
outcome of such researches was _South Indian Rebellion: First
War of Independence 1800--1801_ by Rajayyan, from Madurai
University, based on official documents in Madras archives.

The revolt of 1800 in South India was as inspiring as
the 1857--59 struggle in North India. The planners, organizers,
leaders and other heroic patriots belonging to various
sections of the people had left the imprints of their personality
on the history of struggle of not only South India, but
also on the India-wide struggles for independence. And the
names of at least some of these patriots --- Kattabomman of
Tirunelveli, Pazhassi Raja of Malabar and others --- and their
glorious deeds are, to some extent, known to us.

So far, the glorious deeds of these patriots were regarded
only as stories of isolated acts of heroism. This is not
Correct. They formed part of a widespread movement which
extended all over South India covering not only the four
States of Kerala, Tamilnadu, Andhra and Karnataka, but
also Maharashtra. In short, the resistance and revolts of 1800--1801 constituted an attempt to mobilize the various
sections of the masses as well as the elites inhabiting areas
south of the Vindhyas into an organized force to fight the
foreign aggressors. Rajayyan has characterized these revolts
as "the most widespread of all liberation wars of the
pre-Congress epoch" and the "first and the last violent
popular struggle of any formidable dimensions", etc.[^04/1]

[^04/1]: Rajayyan, _South Indian Rebellion: First War of Independence_, 1971, p. 20.

Overwhelmed by the facts of history discovered by
him, the author sometimes even belittles the significance of
the 1857--59 struggle. While disagreeing with Rajayyan in
regard to such incorrect conclusions, we are at the same time
grateful to him for having written a book on the independence
struggle in South India based on authentic facts.

The author describes the political situation and circumstances
that led to the South Indian revolt, which can be
called the first _freedom struggle_ of India, before going into
the details of the sweep of that struggle, the maturity and
the organizational skill and efficiency of the leadership, the
despicable tactics adopted by the enemy and the successive
clashes that took place.

Anyone who examines the facts now brought out by
Rajayyan in the light of _Historical Materialism_ can clearly
see that the political factors which led to the struggle in its
sweep and mass support were also responsible for its ultimate
defeat. An understanding of this political situation also
helps us to understand the features that differentiate this
struggle from the _freedom struggle_ of North India.

In this connection, it is worthwhile to note certain special
features of South India. This region was totally free from
the domination of the emperors who had ruled North India,
right from the period of the Mauryas to that of the Mughals.
At times when this region happened to be subjugated
by one or the other of these emperors, liberation from such
domination was achieved speedily. And at the time when
the foreign conquerors, from the Portuguese to the British,
were attempting to establish and consolidate their position in
India, all regions of South India were free from even nominal
domination of the Delhi Emperor.

The Marathas who had been consistently carrying on a
struggle against the _Mughal Emperors_ had not only liberated
their region, but had even invaded the northern regions and
acquired some areas from the domination of the _Mughal
Emperors_; the _Nizam_ of Hyderabad had virtually become an
independent ruler, though in name he was subordinate to the
_Mughal Emperor_; the _Sultan_ of Mysore refused to recognize
the suzerainty of the _Mughal Emperor_. There were several
other States which maintained independence like Mysore --- the
Tamil princes of Tanjore, Madurai, Ramanad, Arcot, etc.,
and the princes of Malabar, whom Rajayyan credits with the
distinction of having maintained their political independence
for over 1000 years. Cochin and Travancore had grown up
into powerful States.

Perennial feuds were taking place amongst the princes
of the region south of the Vindhyas. Each prince was persistently
trying to make the others accept his domination so that
he could rise up to the position of a powerful ruler or even
an emperor. They had no compunction in forging alliances
with anyone in order to achieve their aim. It was as part of
this tactic that they were ready, as and when it suited their
purpose, to forge a friendship with or be hostile to the foreign
trading companies.

These rulers had to carry on fights with the feudal lords
under them as well, because it was a specific feature and integral
part of the administrative set-up in South India."Known
as _Poligars_, at time as _Rajahs_ and _Zamindars_, these
chieftains occupied a key position in the political structure
between the princes and their subjects... They paid rent to
the ruler for their lands and maintained bands of armed men
for service with troops of the State in critical times. They
undertook to protect private property against robbery and
pay compensation in the event of their failure. As guardians
of public welfare, they enforced police authority, administered
justice, founded villages, conducted religious festivals,
maintained temples, promoted cultivation and assisted charitable
services. As an intermediary authority they performed
what the rulers normally negotiated to do in the field of public
welfare. While the common people found it beyond their
reach to gain positions in the central administration, they
experienced no such difficulty in the establishments. This
created and nurtured a bond of affinity between _Poligars_ and
the masses."[^04/2] (In Tamil Nadu and Karnataka the feudal
lords were known as _poligars_. The terms "feudal lords" is
used here to include those in Kerala also though they were
not known by that name).

[^04/2]: _Ibid_, pp. 22,24.

Friendly relations between the masses and the feudal
lords were looked upon by each prince to be as dangerous to
him as the military forces of other princes. For, as long as
they (feudal lords) enjoyed popularity with the masses no
prince would be able to establish his domination over them.
Even if they succeeded in defeating their enemies and conquering
their territories, there was no guarantee that they could
sustain their domination as long as the feudal lords existed.

It was these princes who had to conduct war against their
feudal lords as well as against other princes that welcomed
with open arms the foreign traders as forces that could be of
help and assistance to them in both these ventures.

In this dual struggle, they could, of course, depend to
an extent upon the local allies, namely, some other princes
and their armies. But the foreign companies could help them
more effectively for two reasons. First, these foreign trading
companies had more effective weapons and better method of
warfare using these weapons. Second, the foreign companies
which commanded larger maritime forces could bring in more
commodities for them and obstruct the enemy's sea route.
Therefore, it became a part of the policy of the princes to
depend on one or the other foreign company which came to
India one after another.

The policy of dependence on foreign trading companies
in order to extend the areas of their domination became common
amongst the princes in the 16th century throughout
India. But South India had a special feature as compared
with North India. As stated earlier, there was not an emperor
oven nominally in the South. Each prince was independent,
and as such the victory or defeat in the various conflicts that
took place amongst them was solely dependent on the military
strength of the respective combatants.

Furthermore, southern India is closer to coastlines than
the regions in northern India. As such, the foreign mercantile
companies, backed by naval and military forces, could exercise
influence on the political relations in southern India more
skillfully and rapidly than they could in the northern Indian
region.

As a consequence, by the end the 18th century the whole
of South India came under the domination of the British.
The princes in this region surrendered one by one to the
British at different times. The _Rajas_ of Travancore, Pudukkottai,
Tanjore, Arcot and Mysore, the _Peshwa_ of Poona
and the _Nizam_ of Hyderabad, either subordinated their
authority to the British or their territories were turned into
British territories. By the close of the 18th century a dual
administrative system of British India and native States came
into being in South India.

It is the revolt of the feudal lords who were the subordinates
of the princes, against the new rulers that has been
dealt with in Rajayyan's book. As mentioned earlier, these
feudal lords maintained friendly relations with the common
people and as such their revolt against the British had the
support of the masses. Each feudal lord was able to deploy
thousands of soldiers on the field. And when the forces at
the command of the various feudal lords who entered into
fraternal alliances were mobilized together, it turned out to
be a big military force.

An organization comprising the leaders of these revolts,
from Kattabomman of Tirunelveli at the southerneond to
Dhondoji Wagh of the area comprising North Canara[^north-canara] and
South Maharashtra, came into being to mobilize military
forces and co-ordinate their activities. Rajayyan bas analysed
in detail the individual characteristics and qualities of each
one of these leaders, the methods of mobilization and co-ordination
and the resultant centralized action programme.
As in the case of the revolt of 1857--59 it was only through a
long-drawn-out armed conflict that the British were able to
suppress the planned programme of revolt organized by these
leaders.

[^north-canara]: Uttara Kannada, formerly known as North Canara, is a district in the Indian state of Karnataka.

Rajayyan describes Maruda Pandyan of Sivaganga as
the "most conspicuous amongst the leaders, and the political
strategist of this movement". He mobilized not only all
the feudal lords in the regions south of Madurai, including
Kattabomman of Tirunelveli, and the masses of people in
their areas, but also worked with the aim of mobilizing the
_anti-British_ insurrectionists in areas like Dindigual, Coimbatore,
Malabar, Mysore and Maharashtra and utilize the
military forces of all of them to attack the British fortresses.

The plan of action succeeded to a considerable extent.
The British found it hard to suppress this revolt of 1800--1801
in South India, just as they found it later on in 1857--59 in
North India. Rajayyan has cited the opinions and comments
expressed by some British military chiefs and administrators
for this. The saga of these revolts is bound to create
in our minds feelings of esteem and respect for the insurrectionists
of South India.

But this revolt in South India was cruelly suppressed by
the British in the same manner as they did all other _freedom
struggles_ in India, including the struggle of 1857--59. Hundreds
of heroic patriots who had participated in this struggle were
sentenced to death. Several hundreds of others lost all their
properties and were reduced to a state of destitution. Dozens
of persons were deported. National independence which was
the cherished goal of their life turned out to be only a remembrance
of the past and a dream of the future. Masses
of people had to suffer untold miseries under the brutal heels
of the British.

What caused such a development? Maruda Pandyan,
foremost amongst the leaders of the struggle, provides a
simple answer. In the Tiruchi proclamation of 1801, Maruda
Pandyan stated that the princes who were not "aware of the
duplicity" of the Europeans "foolishly" trusted them and
that there was "no unity and friendships" amongst the people.
"His Highness the _Nawab_ Mohammed Ali having foolishly
given the Europeans place amongst you has become like a
widow. The Europeans violating their faith have deceitfully
made the Kingdom their own and (are) considering the
inhabitants as dogs, accordingly exercise authority over them.
There exist no unity and friendship amongst you. The above
castes (_Brahmins_, _Kshatriyas_, _Vysyas_, _Sudras_ and _Mussalmans_)
who not being aware of the duplicity of these Europeans.
... have not only inconsiderately culminated each other
but have absolutely surrendered the Kingdom to them."[^04/3]

[^04/3]: _Ibid_, p. 232.

It appears that Rajayyan agrees with this. But this is
not a satisfactory explanation, for this does not explain the
reasons for the "foolishness" of the princes and disunity
among the people. Nor does Rajayyan explain why a system
that existed for several centuries came to such a pass only
now.

The real answer to the question had been indicated in
the preceding chapters. The conflict here was between an
outdated decadent indigenous social system and a foreign
social system that was being newly evolved. While, on the
one side, one section is eager to build a new society, another
section is eager to protect its own land and the ancient customs
and traditions characteristic of it. It is only through
imbibing the essence of modern society that came to this
country through the foreigners, and modernising our society
can we protect our country from attack by foreigners. On
the other hand, the planners and organizers of the _freedom
struggle_ were striving to restore to the rulers their respective
territories in accordance with their beliefs and customs. In
the following chapters we shall see that the organizers of the
North Indian revolt that took place half a century later fought
for the same objectives, which again constituted the weakness
of that struggle.

## THE BACKGROUND OF 1857 STRUGGLE

In one respect eastern India comprising Bengal, Bihar,
Orissa and Assam is comparable with southern India.
Maritime transport of this region provided easy access to
foreign trading companies; they established themselves there
and then gradually transformed their trade relations into
political relations, as they did in the South.

This region was, however, different in another respect
from South India. This region formed part of the _Mughal
Empire_. The _Nawab_ of Bengal was one amongst the several
subordinate local rulers under the _Mughal Emperor_. The
British became the rulers in the eastern region of India by
establishing trade relation with the _Nawab_ of Bengal to start
with and then by gradually transforming these relations into
political relations. Once they secured the concessions they
sought from the _Nawab_ of Bengal, they took particular care
to obtain from the _Mughal Emperor_ the grant of the _Diwani_
(the right to carry on civil administration) of this region in
order to ensure the security of the concessions.

Unlike the kingdoms in the South, the Mughal Empire
had, by this time, succeeded to a certain extent in establishing
a centralized administration. The land revenue system
devised and implemented by Raja Todarmal, a minister in
the court of Emperor Akbar, had brought the feudal lords
under the centralized administration as it did the military
force under the Empire. In many regions in South India,
too, there were intermediaries like _Poligars_ who had considerable
influence among the people. But such a system had
become weak throughout the North in the later Mughal
period itself. The Mughal administration had appointed
many elites as local agents in place of the traditional _Jagirdars_
and _Talukdars_.

It was on the basis of this historical fact that the new
British rulers introduced _Permanent Settlement_ in 1793 in
eastern India. This system was different from the _Ryotwari_
system which they introduced in South India.

Under the _Ryotwari_ system, the actual cultivators and
the government are in direct contact with each other without
intermediaries. The actual yield that the cultivator got from
his landholding, his expenses for cultivation, etc., were
assessed and the share to be paid to the government out of
the surplus was fixed. The government collected its dues
directly from the actual cultivators. The amount payable to
the government was fixed from time to time.

Under the _Permanent Settlement_ (_Zamindari_) implemented
in eastern India, the government did not deal with the
cultivators directly. Instead, the government dealt with
intermediaries known as _Zamindars_, _Taluqdars_, etc. The
dues that these intermediaries had to pay to the government
were permanently fixed. The intermediaries who duly discharged
their liability of paying the prescribed amount due
to the government could collect any amount they liked from
the cultivators. Even if the income of the intermediaries
increased, the dues that they had to pay to the government
remained static.

These differences in landownership relations gave rise to
a difference in the political system. In South India, the _Poligars_
and other feudal lords who had been intermediaries
before the introduction of the _Ryotwari_ system were deprived
of the position and benefits they had been enjoying for centuries.
The principal motive force for the revolts in the
South was the anguish and indignation of those who were thus
deprived of positions.

In eastern India, on the other hand, instead of abolishing
the intermediaries, a new section of intermediaries came
into being. In the place of the feudal lords who were performing
various functions, including the collection of taxes, for
centuries under the Mughals, another section of intermediaries
with the sole responsibility of collecting taxes began to
emerge in the later period of the _Mughal Empire_. The new
intermediaries often functioned in accordance with the will
and pleasure of the _Nawabs_ of those days.

It was in this historical background that the British rulers
who obtained the _Diwani_ from the _Mughal Emperor_ gave
permanency to the system of intermediaries. Consequently, the
new intermediaries emerged with opportunities to earn income
but without the political power which the _Jagirdars_ and _Taluqdars_
were enjoying earlier, Thus within 20 years of introducing
_Permanent Settlement_, the _Zamindari_ properties began
to be bought and sold for prices several times over the amount
of a year's tax. Through these transactions a new wealthy
section with as much interested in the _Zamindari_ properties
as the _Zamindars_ themselves, emerged in these regions.

More than one intermediary (at times as many as half a dozen)
appeared in between the _Zamindar_ and the actual cultivators.
Usurers engaged in money transactions with these intermediaries
also became a part of the social life of those regions.
At the other end of this process were the actual possessors
and cultivators of land, most of whom were getting pauperized.
Even a section of the _Zamindars_ lost their land due
to their inability to pay the dues to the government. But no
section of the former elite class in areas covered by _Permanent
Settlement_ lost everything as a result of the British rule
as it happened in the case of the _Poligars_ and other feudal
lords in South India where the _Ryotwari_ system was introduced.
It was on account of this that eastern India submitted
relatively peacefully to the British rule at a time when a widespread
_freedom struggle_ was going on in South India.

The living conditions of the poorer sections of the people
and the middle class were nonetheless getting worse in eastern
India as they were in South India, The common people of
eastern India had to bear an additional burden of the new
intermediary created as a result of the introduction of _Permanent
Settlement_.

Despite this, such widespread struggles as were taking
place in South India did not take place in eastern India. This
was because, unlike in southern India, there was no section
of intermediaries to lead a struggle of the common people in
eastern India. The section of intermediaries which should
have considered itself capable of heading such a struggle was
interested in the maintenance of the British rule. That was why,
again, eastern India remained relatively peaceful at a time
when widespread struggles were taking place in South India.

I have used the terms "relatively peaceful" deliberately.
It was not as if the entire eastern region was peaceful till the
year 1857. Even prior to 1857, several revolts and clashes had
taken place in some areas of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam.
But such revolts were distinctly different in character from
the struggle that was carried on in South India during 1800--1801.

As distinct from the struggle in South India, the struggles
that took place in eastern India were mainly the revolts of
the tribals. The Chuwar tribes of areas extending from
western Midnapur to southern Bihar, and of Chota Nagpur
and Orissa, the Ho tribes of Singhbhum, the Santals of
Rajmahal area, the Gonds of Orissa, the Bhoomijas of
Malbhum, the Kols and Mundas of Chota Napur, and the
Khasis of Assam were involved in revolts on many occasions.
In Orissa, tribal landlords and princes also participated in the
resistance movements along with their people. Each one of
these events taken in isolation represents the demonstration
of the untiring patriotism of the Indian people who were not
prepared to surrender to the foreign domination.

But no efforts were made to link these various struggles
into a coordinated struggle under a central leadership in
eastern India. That such an effort was made in South India
distinguishes it from eastern India. This difference arose
because in eastern India there were no sectors like the _poligars_
and the feudal lords of the South, capable of coordinating
the various scattered struggles taking place in different regions.
At the same time, as a consequence of the _Permanent Settlement_,
a new section of intermediaries having a vested interest
in the continuance of the domination of the new rulers (the
British), had emerged in eastern India. Thus, the common
people of this region, who were eager to fight against the new
rulers, found themselves in a helpless situation.

Consequently, with the beginning of the 19th century the
British were able to consolidate their domination both in
southern and eastern parts of India. While in South India
the consolidation was effected after suppressing a relatively
widespread _freedom struggle_, such a consolidation was
achieved without any significant resistance in eastern India.
The tribal revolts referred to above broke out only by the
second decade of the 19th century, after the British rule
was consolidated in the plains of Bengal and in South India.

The British were, however, not content with the consolidation
of their position in Bengal and southern India. They
were determined to extend their dominion to other regions
of India, too. They had no compunction in unilaterally violating
the provisions of agreements they had entered into
with various feudal lords and princes. They ceded the
territories ruled over by several princes and feudal lords,
who were nominally under the suzerainty of the _Mughal
Emperor_ but were in fact independent rulers of their territories.

Ultimately they wielded their sword even against the
_Mughal Emperor_. They changed their attitude towards the
Emperor. From the position of supplicants seeking concessions
from him and offering tributes to him, the British officials
started behaving as if they were the 'dispensers of boons'.
One British administrator (Amhersts) made it plain in writing
to the Emperor:

>Your Kingship is but nominal, it is merely
out of courtesy that you are addressed as King.[^04/4]
>
>The British Resident at the Court refused to stand in
his presence when presenting _Nazr_[^nazr]. Auckland asked Bahadur
Shah[^last-emperor] to abandon his claims and rights. He stopped the
offering of _Nazr_, the privilege of granting robes of honour
and holding _Durbars_. The _Diwan-i-Khas_[^diwan-i-khas] and the _Diwan-i-Am_[^diwan-i-am]
were closed. He was pressed to give up residence in the
Red Fort, to abjure the title of King and to abandon his
prerogative to name his successor.[^04/5]

[^04/4]: Tara Chand, _op. cit_, Vol II, p. 47.

[^nazr]: In Islam, nazr is a vow or commitment to carry out an act. Amongst other things, one of the form it takes is paying tribute to a superior (Emperor) or the payment of a fee when taking office.

[^last-emperor]: Bahadur Shah II was the last emperor of Mughal empire.

[^diwan-i-khas]: The _Diwan-i-Khas_, or Hall of Private Audiences, was a chamber in the Red Fort of Delhi where the Mughal Emperors received courtiers and state guests.

[^diwan-i-am]: The _Diwan-i-Am_, or Hall of Audience, is a room in the Red Fort of Delhi where the Mughal emperors received members of the general public and heard their grievances.

[^04/5]: _Ibid_.

There were no repercussions in North India when the
authority and status of _poligars_ and other feudal lords in
South India were eliminated. This was because in North
India the British were partially recognizing the status and
position of the _Mughal Emperor_ and of the _Nawabs_, princes
and others subordinates to him. Further, in Bengal and other
areas where _Permanent Settlement_ had been introduced, a
section of intermediaries who were interested in keeping
themselves attached to the British administration had emerged.
But as the British began to establish a centralized
administration extending to the whole of India soon after
consolidating their power in South India and Bengal, the
rich elite classes of North India also rose in revolt against
the British rule.

It was an outburst of these feelings that was witnessed
in the period from 1857 to 1859. We shall go into the
details of these struggles later on. But let us note here how
some authoritative spokesmen of the British administration
had themselves characterized the rebellion of 1857--59.

Disraeli was one of the eminent thinkers amongst the
British administrators in the 19th century. He characterized
this struggle as a "national revolt" and opposed to its being
treated as an "army revolt".

Ellenborough who became the president of the Board
of Control of East India Company in 1853, censuring the
confiscation of _taluqdaris_ in Oudh. wrote:

>We must admit
that, under the circumstances, the hostilities which have been
carried on in Oudh have rather the character of legitimate
war than that of rebellion.[^04/6]

[^04/6]: _Ibid_, p. 41.

Another historian (Justin McCarthy) has recorded:

>It
was a combination of military grievances, national hatred
and religious fanaticism against the English occupation of
India. The native princes, and the native soldiers were in
it. The _Mohammedan_[^mohammedan] and the _Hindoo_[^hindoo] forgot their old
religious antipathies to join against the Christian.[^04/7]

[^mohammedan]: A person of Muslim faith

[^hindoo]: A person of Hindu faith

[^04/7]: _Ibid_.

As we have already noticed, from the point of view of
modern nationalism, the South Indian struggle of 1800--1801
and the North Indian struggle of 1857--59 were national
struggles with a number of weaknesses and inadequacies.
But we should not underestimate the historical importance
and significance of these and other bigger and smaller struggles
that took place in different parts of India. Each one of these struggles demonstrated the intensity of
the feeling of patriotism among the Indian people which
could not be suppressed by the use of brutal force. The
freedom fighters of the later generations strove to uphold
the great traditions of these struggles and march forward
by avoiding their weaknesses.

## "_SEPOY MUTINY_" OR POPULAR REVOLT!

The British had once propagated that what took place
during the years 1857 to 1859 in India was only a _sepoy
mutiny_ and that it did not have any support from the people
of India.

Later on, when the national movement for independence
gathered momentum, historians came forward with facts
claiming that it was a _freedom struggle_ and that it had widespread
support of the people. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar,
who had actively participated in the _freedom struggle_ and
who was convicted to a long term of imprisonment, had even
written a book, entitled _The Indian War of Independence_ in
which he had brought out several facts and authoritative
documents that had not yet seen the light of the day.

Following Savarkar, several other political activists and
scholars of history, basing themselves on the stand of the
nationalists, tried to evaluate the struggle of 1857--59. As a
result of extensive research conducted by them, it came to
light that the British officials who had either directly participated
in those incidents or had witnessed them, were themselves
divided on the character of the so-called _Sepoy Mutiny_.
Col. G.B. Malleson,[^04/8] Sir John William Kaye,[^04/9] Charles Ball,[^04/10]
Rev. Alexander Duff[^04/11] and many others had cited several instances
of mass support that the insurrectionists had. According
to Keye, there was none among the Hindus and Muslims
from Ganga to Yamuna who was not against the British.

[^04/8]: Col. GB. Malleson, _History of the Indian Mutiny_, in three volumes,
London, 1878--80.

[^04/9]: Sir William Kaye, _A History of the Sepoy War in India_, in three volumes,
London, 1878--80.

[^04/10]: C. Ball, _History of the Indian Mutiny_, in two volumes, London.

[^04/11]: Dr. A.D Duff, _The Indian Rebellion: Its Causes and Results_, London 1858.

Malleson expressed the opinion that the majority of the
people in Oudh (Ayodhya) Rohilkland, Bundelkhand, Sagar
and Narmada were against the British.

What is more, Disraeli, who later became the Prime
Minister of England, participating in the deliberations in the
House of Commons on July 27, 1857, disagreed with the
official view that _the Indian struggle_ was merely a "military
mutiny."

By 1947, as in the case of many other matters, a new
impetus was given to research into the Indian _freedom struggle_.
The centenary of the "_freedom struggle_" which the
British authorities called "_Sepoy Mutiny_", was celebrated
under the auspices of the government itself. As a part of the
celebrations extensive research work was organized. Committees
were constituted under the direct leadership of Maulana
Abul Kalam Azad who was then the Union Minister for
Education.

Prof. Tara Chand's _History of the Freedom Movement in
India_, from which several quotations were given in the earlier
chapters, was the result of this work. This was prepared under
official auspices. A series of monographs was also published
non-officially under the supervision of Dr. R.C. Majumdar.
Several other books, pamphlets and theses were also brought
out. Yet, although not in the same from as in the earlier
days, two fundamentally differing approaches remained with
the historians on the nature and contents of the struggle of 1857--59.

Although it is not correct to characterize it as a mere
"_Sepoy Mutiny_" as the British administration had done
earlier, it is not correct either to maintain that the _sepoys_
or the civilians took up arms and fought against the government
with the aim of liberating the country from the yoke of
the British; their aim was selfish---this was one opinion. In
the view of another section of scholars, what took place in 1857--59 was a _people's revolt_.

The most vociferous advocate of the former opinion
was Dr. Majumdar, and of the latter Dr. SB Choudhury, [^04/12]
In between these two was Dr. S.N. Sen;[^04/13] the author of _Eighteen
Fifty Seven_ published with an introduction by Maulana Azad.
He opined that in Oudh and in the surrounding areas it was
a people's rebellion; while in other places it was merely a
_sepoy mutiny_.

[^04/13]: Surendra Nath Sen, _Eighteen Fifty Seven_, New Delhi, 1957.

But it is important to note that even Dr. Majumdar, who
was opposed to the characterization of 1857--59 as a _freedom
struggle_, was not prepared to consider it as a mere _sepoy
mutiny_. The very title of his book was _Sepoy Mutiny and the
Revolt of 1857_.[^04/14] Justifying this title, he wrote:

>I have selected
the title '_The Sepoy Mutiny and the Revolt of 1857_' as in
my opinion it correctly describes the essential nature of the
movements, whatever we might take of it. The word 'revolt'
is used in its normal sense of casting off allegiance to the
rulers, and does not convey any moral judgement such as
disapproval or odium.[^04/15]

[^04/15]: Majumdar, _Ibid_, II Ed , Introduction, pp XVI-XVII.

Thus, it can be seen that even right from the British
officials and historians referred to above, to the Indian scholars
of history like Dr. Majumdar who have no sympathy
for the objectives of the struggle, do concede the popular
support to it.

One can say without hesitation that it was a rebellion in
which millions of people in areas covered by the present Uttar
Pradesh, and some parts of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh participated.
At the same time, it was a movement without popular
support in the entire South India, eastern India including
Bengal, and in Punjab. Even scholars like Dr. Choudhury
who characterize it as a _people's struggle_ do accept this fact.

When we examine this struggle taking into consideration
all the facts which are accepted equally by the scholars from
both the camps, we arrive at the following conclusions.

1. In the sense that it was the _sepoys_ who played the main
   role in the _anti-British_ revolt, it was a _sepoy mutiny_.
2. However, behind the '_sepoy mutiny_' lay the intense discontent
   of the people. Therefore, when the _sepoys_ rose in
   revolt (in certain areas even before the mutiny started),
   the rural poor revolted against the rulers who were ruining
   their lives, and against the _nouveau riche_ who
   were fattening themselves with the backing of the rulers.
   What the civilian rebellionists did was to destroy the government
   offices and official records and physically liquidate
   government officials, the _nouveau riche_ usurers and
   traders. In this sense, the struggle of 1857--59 (at least
   insofar as the regions mentioned above) was a popular
   rebellion.
3. Except in this limited area, however, there was not only
   no popular support for the struggle, but it faced the
   opposition of the educated new generation, who stood
   behind the British government. For this reason one
   cannot say unequivocally that what took place in 1857--59
   was the "first struggle for independence" as claimed
   by the government and the nationalist political leaders
   and historians.

We have also to specially mention here that a
predominant section of Indian soldiers stood with the British
in 1857--59 to suppress the revolt, and they outnumbered
many times the _sepoys_ who rose in revolt. Had there been
no assistance form the Indian soldiers, not only the British
would not have been able to suppress the rebellion, but they
would have had to pack up and leave the country. The
_bourgeois_ nationalists and nationalist historians are shutting
their eyes to this truth when they characterize the 1857--59
struggle as the "first struggle for independence".

Hence, three important questions come up before one
who studies history scientifically without pre-conceived
notions and prejudices.

_Firstly_, how was it that in Oudh and the surrounding
areas _people's revolt_ mingled with the _sepoys_' mutiny and
how could that rebellion last nearly two years, throwing a
challenge to the British rule?

_Secondly_, why was it that only a _sepoys_' mutiny without
a _people's revolt_ burst out in regions outside these areas?
What was the reason for any type of _people's struggle_ not
coming up against the British in any other region?

_Thirdly_, why did a majority of the soldiers and the civilian
population come forward to render help to the British to
suppress the _sepoys_ who started the mutiny?

Before answering these three questions it is necessary to
make one thing clear. A revolt like the "_Sepoy Mutiny_" of 1857--59 with or without the backing of a _people's struggle_
was an indication of a very deep crisis of the existing society.
In all revolutions, soldiers' revolts such as this have played
an important role.

In the famous terminology of Lenin, _sepoys_ (or soldiers)
are "peasants in uniform". Their discontent presents itself
during revolutionary stages in the form of quintessence of
all contradictions in society. That was why Lenin gave the
"Soviets", which were the revolutionary organizations of
soldiers as well as of the workers and peasants, a very
prominent place in the advance of the _Russian revolution_.

In the Socialist revolutions of recent times as in China,
Korea, Vietnam and Cuba and in all other revolutions of
the historical periods, the discontent amongst the ranks of
the armed forces and the revolts that gave expression to
this discontent have played key a role.

In India, the British had organized a military which was
totally different in character from all types of military
organizations that were in existence in India. Till then military
organization that were extant in India was one formed under
the feudal lords who were holding a dominant position in all
sectors of life, including social and cultural. The military
hierarchy consisted of the emperor or the king at the top,
with the feudal lord and the local chiefs below him, in that
order, who maintained relations, though exploitative, with
the people. This relationship between them and the people
was reflected in the military organization also.

On the other hand, the British built a military organization
with a new kind of relationship between officers and
rank based on pay and bureaucratic discipline, breaking the
traditional set-up. Moreover, in this new organization,
officers at all levels were foreigners. Consequently, unlike
in the earlier set-up, there remained absolutely no relationship
between the officers and ranks touching upon the social
and cultural aspects of life. The _sepoys_ came to realize
that the British rulers were utilizing them to destroy all
socio-cultural institutions that their predecessors had fondly
built and also those who were heading those institutions.
This naturally fostered anger and indignation in their minds.

This intense feeling first burst out as early as in 1806.
The Vellore mutiny in the South was a forerunner of 1857--59,
although it was relatively smaller in extent. Following this
revolt, several small revolts of a similar nature had broken
out in various parts of the country. Although each one of
these was suppressed, the forces behind these struggles,
namely, the social forces born out of the contradictions
between the official duties that the _sepoys_ were forced to
discharge as tools of foreign rulers and the reality that they
belonged to that section of the people who were ruined day
by day, being the victims of exploitation by the very same
foreign dominators. The 1857--59 revolt was the outburst of
these forces.

Considered in this light, the question once again comes
up before us: Why did 1857--59 not spread all over India and
why the majority of the _sepoys_ themselves and the civilian
population, except in Oudh and the surrounding areas,
helped the British? A detailed answer to this question may
be found in the chapters that follow. But let us note one
point here. The contradiction inherent in the feudal military
set-up in India before the British established their power in
the country was far greater than the contradiction in the
military organization built by the British. In fact, although
the _Mughal Emperors_ declared themselves the rulers of
India, neither under them nor in the earlier periods was
there a State or military organization which could be termed
really "Indian". During the decades immediately preceding,
various sections like the Sikhs of Punjab, the Hindustanis,
Maharashtrians, South Indians and so on, had their own
separate military organizations and chiefs. They were fighting
amongst themselves, each one striving to dominate over
the other. It was as part of these fights that they entered
into military alliance and political relations with the foreigners.
In Marx's words:

>How came it that English supremacy
was established in India? The paramount power of the Great
Mogul was broken by the Mogul Viceroys[^viceroy]. The power of
the Viceroys was broken by the _Marathas_. The power
of the _Marathas_ was broken by the Afghans, and while all
were struggling against all, the Briton rushed in and was
enabled to subdue them all.[^04/16]

[^viceroy]: A viceroy is an official who runs a polity in the name of and as the representative of the monarch of the territory. The term derives from the Latin prefix _vice-_, meaning "in the place of" and the French word _roy_, meaning "king".

[^04/16]: _The First Indian War of Independence_, _op. cit_, p. 33.

This state of affairs was reflected in 1857--59 as well.
The Rani of Jhansi, Nana Saheb and other recognized leaders
of that revolt sought at one time or the other the assistance
from the British in order to protect their own interests and
to inflict defeat on their opponents. When they started their
struggles against the British, their opponents sought the help
of the British against them. No wonder, therefore, when
the leaders themselves acted in this manner, the ordinary
soldiers and the lower ranks acted as tools of the British
against the mutiny.

Briefly, the rebellion of 1857--59 was the outburst of the
social contradictions that lay below the new military organization
and the State established by the British rulers in
India. And behind the suppression of the rebellion lay the
fundamental contradiction inherent in the pre-British Indian
society.

## THE BATTLE OF DELHI

The outburst of revolt of the _sepoys_ of Meerut against
their officers on May 9, 1857, marked the beginning of the
"_Sepoy Mutiny_". These rebellious troops marched to Delhi,
and on reaching there appealed to Bahadur Shah, the living
successor of Akbar and Aurangazeb, to take up the leadership
of the _anti-British_ struggle they had started.

Bahadur Shah was an old man, a simpleton, and did
not possess the traditions and fame established by his predecessors.
Nothing more could be said of Bahadur Shah than that
he was born in the family of the _Mughal Emperors_ who had
ruled the country for several decades, in grandeur and glory.
In other words, he represented only the outer shell of the
renowned _Mughal Empire_.

But even this shell turned out to be a sharp weapon in
the _anti-British_ struggle. Weak and old, he was the last of the
_Mughal Emperors_ and the symbol of a social and administrative
system which the people of Delhi and the surrounding
areas had witnessed for several generations. It was in his
name that the soldiers and the civilian population of that area
organized the _anti-British_ struggle.

We have noticed earlier, that the British became the
rulers in Bengal and the surrounding areas by obtaining the
_Diwani_ from the Emperor of Delhi. It was by recognizing at
least nominally the supremacy of the Emperor of Delhi that
they acquired the right to thus rule over Bihar, Orissa and
other regions. In Bengal, on the other hand, they became
the rulers after acting in the name of the _Nawab_ who was
directly under the Emperor.

It was in the initial stage of the power of the English
East India Company that they acquired power in this manner
directly from the emperor or his local representative. They
had to act very cautiously at that time. Their method was to
enter into military and political alliance with the princes and
_Nawabs_ under the emperor without offending him and even
by pretending that they were submissive to him. The situation
obtained at that time was such that only by following this
policy in all the bordering areas of the empire would they be
able to establish their domination.

In about the same period, the British gained ruling power
in southern India, a region which was not even nominally
under the jurisdiction of the Emperor of Delhi, by forming
alliance with the princes and _Nawabs_ in that region. Amongst
these princes and _Nawabs_ was the _Nizam_ of Hyderabad who
was nominally under the jurisdiction of the Emperor as also
the Marathas who were consistently in conflict with Delhi.
Thus, the British began to consolidate their power in regions
which were ruled by princes and others who were outside
the jurisdiction of the emperor or were only nominally under
him.

The situation obtained in the regions described as the
centres of "_Sepoy Mutiny_" was entirely different. To the
people of those regions, the Emperor of Delhi was not a distant
ruler. They had been living directly under the authority
of Emperor for generations. The elite class discharged various
duties and responsibilities as part of that administrative system
and received as remuneration for such services in cash or in
the form of land or other benefits and concessions, and
acquired authority and position. The Muslims among them
were contented that the administration under the _Mughal
emperors_ was their own, while the Hindus were convinced
that, though belonged to a different religion, they were being
treated with affection and respect. (Even under the rule of
Aurangazeb, who was regarded as anti-Hindu, there were
several Hindus occupying high positions.) Thus, the Delhi
Emperor was the head of an administrative system which generally
enjoyed loyalty and confidence of the elite classes
irrespective of the religion they professed.

Fully realising this, the British dealt with the Emperor
with deference and submissiveness during the period just prior
to the outbreak of the "_Sepoy Mutiny_". We have noted
earlier that the flames of _anti-British_ sentiment began to flare
up in North India leading to the sepoy and civilian revolts
when they changed their attitude towards the Emperor of
Delhi. A change of a similar nature also came about in their
attitude towards the princes and _Nawabs_, subordinate to the
Emperor, and the _Talukdars_ and other feudal lords subordinate
to the princes and _Nawabs_.

The British decided to deal with feudal lords, princes
and the _Nawabs_ of Delhi and the surrounding areas only
after consolidating their authority in eastern and southern
India and after getting a section of the people friendly to
them by transforming the socio-economic structures in these
regions.

Another change that had come about as a result of this
decision, namely, paying formal visits to the Emperor and
offering him presents, etc., has already been mentioned
earlier. Along with this they also deprived the princes and
_Nawabs_ of the right of adoption of successors, as also various
traditional rights and benefits they had been enjoying since
long. In addition, they also took measures to supervise the
administrative functions of the princes and _Nawabs_ and
under the pretext of obviating misdeeds, to transfer the
administration to themselves. In short, they unleashed a virtual
attack against the Emperor of Delhi, the princes and
_Nawabs_.

At stated earlier, before doing this, they had already
consolidated their authority in eastern and southern India.
Even in Punjab, Nepal, North-west Frontier region and in
Afghanistan they had established their authority. And for
this purpose they managed to secure the help and assistance
of the Emperor of Delhi and of the feudal lords of the neighbouring
areas.

With the completion of this process, only the Emperor
of Delhi and the rulers in the surrounding areas remained to
be tackled. It became certain that in the event of a confrontation
with them, the British would secure the assistance of
the elite class and soldiers of the other regions. It was only
then that they turned towards the rulers of Delhi and surrounding
areas. It was for this reason that, as described in the
earlier chapter, the struggle of 1857--59 and the _people's
revolt_ were confined mainly to this region. It was again for
this same reason that while the _sepoy mutiny_ was going on
with the co-operation of the wide masses of the people at least
in these limited areas, parallel struggles by the rural and
urban poor and middle classes broke out against the British.

As far as this region was concerned, it was a real people's
movement. It was not only the Emperor of Delhi, the princes,
_Nawabs_ and _Talukdars_ and other feudal lords that the British
ventured to attack and suppress. The life pattern then extant
amongst the masses of people in the entire region was one
based on the domination of the feudal elements with the
Emperor of Delhi at the top. The destruction of the domination
of the feudal lords meant disruption of the life
pattern of the people. It also meant that the entire people
were compelled to move towards a situation wherein
they had perforce to bring about a thorough change in the
pattern of life that they have been living for generations.
Naturally therefore, the waves of _anti-British_ feelings expressed
by the feudal elements swept also through the common
people. They had looked upon the feudal lords, including the
Emperor of Delhi, as their traditional leaders and hence
joined the _anti-British_ struggles organized by them.

In the previous chapter we had made particular mention
of some incidents as evidence to show that the _Sepoy Mutiny_
was accompanied by _people's revolts_. Besides, killing British
officials and setting fire to their offices, the masses also
destroyed the records maintained by the _Nouveau riche_ of
their monetary transactions, profiteering in trade, etc. These
incidents revealed the fact that the attacks unleashed by the
revolting people were not against the traditional feudal lords
but against the new elites who were fattening themselves in
the shade of the British administrators. While destroying
the properties of this section of the elite classes, they chose
as their leaders the traditional elites, like the Rani of Jhansi,
Nana Saheb who rose to become the _Peshwa_ of the Marathas,
and such others. It was a part of this that the _sepoys_
who raised the banner of revolt in Meerut marched to Delhi
and installed the successor of Akbar and Aurangazeb as
their leader. The British knew that this would have serious
repercussions throughout northern India. They feared that
the people who see Bahadur Shah, whom they were compelled
to recognize at least nominally as the _Mughal Emperor_,
heading the princes and _Nawabs_ leading the Indian soldiers
against the British, would render all assistance to the mutineers.
They were therefore determined to capture Delhi, the
capital of the Emperor at any cost and take the "Emperor"
prisoner. On the other side, the revolting _sepoys_ were determined
not to yield and not to allow Delhi fall to the British.

Consequently, the "Battle of Delhi" which lasted for a
few weeks was an important event in the struggle of 1857.
It had military significance. But even more significant was
the political aspect of the battle.

The fall of Delhi and the imprisonment of Bahadur
Shah did not end the _Sepoy Mutiny_ and _people's revolt_ in
the military sense. But the British occupation of Delhi, the
capital of an empire for several generations, and the imprisonment
of the head of that state, started the process of
decline of the morale of the insurrectionists --- both _sepoys_
and masses of people. Following these developments, the
_sepoys_ and the people in revolt could not hold out for long;
the centres of revolt fell one after another and finally the
leaders of the revolt either surrendered or were captured.

The most regrettable aspect of the battle of Delhi was
the shameless role played by Bahadur Shah and his family.
Even to maintain the fame and prestige of his family, the
Emperor and the members of his family were not prepared
for a confrontation with the foreign masters. It was due to
the pressure of some sort from soldiers and the people that
Bahadur Shah ultimately agreed to be installed as the leader
of the insurrectionists. And later he agreed to remain informally
their leader and sign the proclamation and to stir the
masses as long as the high tide of the struggle lasted.

But right at the time when the tide of the struggle began
to rise high, he (actually through his wife) did whatever was
possible to negotiate a settlement with the British with the
aim of saving his life and as much property as possible.
While in detention as a prisoner in the Delhi fort, and also
before the trail court this successor of Akbar and Aurangazeb
ventured to prove his innocence by stating that he did
not do anything against the British except succumb to the
pressure of insurrectionists to have his name used as their
leader. This marked the shameless degeneration and surrender
not of Bahadur Shah as an individual but of the class he
represented.

True, others like Nana Saheb and the Rani of Jhansi,
also belonging to the same class, left deep impressions on
the history of the struggle. However, they also met with
the final defeat due to the betrayal by a majority of their
own class. They were the kind of people who refused to
stand by the insurrectionists and rendered assistance to the
foreigners to suppress them even during the high tide of
the popular revolt. Thus, it was the class consisting of the
Bahadur Shahs, who surrendered to the enemy at a crucial
juncture and other feudal lords who had stood with the enemy
all along that was at top of the society of those times. This
constituted the fundamental weakness of a movement which
has been characterized as 'the first _freedom struggle_'.

## THE END OF AN EPOCH

With the imprisonment of Bahadur Shah, the end of the
_Sepoy Mutiny_ and of the accompanying mass revolt was
in sight. But this was not only the end of a particular struggle
or revolt, but a development that also marked the failure of
the Indian society that had been in existence for centuries
before the advent of the European trading companies in India.
This marked the end of a historical epoch extending over the
ancient and medieval periods characterized by the prevalence
of the _varna_ system which resulted from the disintegration
of the ancient tribal society, of castes which had evolved out
of it and the village community basic to it.

As we have seen, till the advent of European trading
companies, the Indian society consisted of three elements,
namely, the Emperor of Delhi, the local rulers directly under
the Emperor or independent of him, and the feudal lords
aligned to them. The rebellions which commenced as local
revolts during the last decades of the 18th century and culminated
in the _sepoy mutiny_ and the popular revolts of northern
India in 1857--59, constituted a series of setbacks which this
system had to face. With the defeat of the 1857--59 struggle, the
last and the most extensive of these revolts, society (or the
elite class occupying top positions in that society) had to lay
down its arms. The surrender of Bahadur Shah and the
heroic end of Rani Jhansi illustrate this fact. But here
it was a defeat not only of the elite class but of the people
as a whole. What was lost in the military victory of the
British was not only the ruling power of the Delhi Emperor
or the properties of the _Talukdars_ and other landlords but
also the entire social life pattern of the whole people embedded
in their system of beliefs, customs and behaviour. The
common masses had felt the intense urge to protect and
maintain their social life pattern and to resist the foreigner's
attacks on it. This urge could be found expressed at each
stage of the future _anti-British_ struggles.

We had referred earlier to the break out of a series of
revolts in the different parts of the country towards the end
of 18th century. The type of revolts which the Hindu _Sanyasis_
and the Muslim _Fakirs_ had carried out, sometimes jointly
and sometimes separately, must also be included in this series.

These revolts occurred at a time when the British had
not yet been able to consolidate the authority which they
had acquired formally from the local _Nawabs_ in Bengal and
the nearby areas and from the Emperor of Delhi. As in the
case of the popular revolts in other areas, what was reflected
in these revolts, too, was the acute discontent of the sections
of the people who were being pauperized under the British
rule, and who had lost their political authority. Thus, following
the Bengal famine of 1770, the people who were affected
by it mobilized themselves under the leadership of
Hindu _Sanyasis_ and Muslim _Fakirs_. In various parts of
Bengal, the forces under the _Sanyasis_ with such strength as
could exterminate the entire British domination, were able to
locally defeat the British soldiers.

But the _Sanyasi_-_Fakir_ revolts were, unlike the other
regional revolts of the period, mainly based on religious feelings.
The feeling was widespread among the Hindus and
the Muslims that Christianity which the European trading
companies brought with them would be dangerous to their
system of life and faiths. Therefore, they believed it their
moral duty to resist this religion and its protectors, the
British.

The _Sanyasi_-_Fakir_ revolts burst out as a result of these
feelings combined with the acute politico-economic discontent
that was growing day by day amongst the people.

Following these revolts, various other movements based
on religious feelings began to emerge in various parts of the
country. Among them, the Muslim revolts had a distinct
character. The Muslim elites had been holding high positions
in the administrative set-up during the days of the
_Delhi Sultanate_ prior to the _Mughal empire_. The feeling
that they would lose these privileges and positions goaded
them into _anti-British_ revolts. Similarly, discontent
was growing amongst the Hindus, too. Several revolts in
which they also participated burst out in various parts of
the country. But the notion that the Muslim rule which
embraced the whole of northern India was about to end gave
rise to certain movements with specific Islamic characteristics.

Of these, the _Faraizi movement_ of Bengal and the
_Wahabi movement_ in the present Uttar Pradesh were two
movements worth particular mention. The core of both these
movements was the call to protect their _Deen_ (religion)
from the attacks from foreigners. The main enemy of these
movements at that time was Christianity, which was considered
to be the force which was attacking both Hinduism and
Islam, along with the British, who were the patrons of that
religion. Consequently, these movements did not lead to
Hindu-Muslim conflicts. However, it contained the germ of
the condition for the development of Hindu-Muslim communalism
which, later, led to the break-up of the unity of
the national _freedom struggle_.

Both Hinduism and Islam had been existing for centuries
in this country before the advent of the British. It is true
that at times, in certain areas, these two religions had entered
into conflicts. But, they both had existed as part of the same
Indian society. The people of both the religions and their
socio-cultural leaders had approved of the same society embedded
in the caste, village and joint-family systems. The
Christians who had considerably spread in many parts of
India (e.g., in Kerala) also had imbibed this characteristic
features of the Indian society.

But the situation changed with the advent of the European
trading companies. Initially the Portuguese and later other
European companies viewed and used Christianity not as a
religion but as a weapon to protect and develop their capitalist
class interests in this country. This led to conflicts between
their Christian religious propaganda and religious beliefs and
the customs based on caste of all sections of the people,
including Christians, who had been living here for generations.
(In Kerala, for example, the conflict between the local Christians
and the Portuguese company men and the _resultant_
_Koonan Kurisu Pledge_[^04/17] are historically well known.) No wonder
then that Hindus who claim to be the representatives of the
Indian culture based on the _Vedas_ and epics and the Muslims
who claim to be the descendants of those who had ruled the
country for centuries, opposed this new (Christian) religious
propagandists and their rule.

[^04/17]: The Koonan Cross is situated in Mattancherry, Cochin. The Portuguese
power established in Cochin refused to recognize the existence of the
indigenous Christian community in Kerala which is commonly believed
to have been established by St. Thomas himself. They tried to impose
the Catholic-Portuguese religious customs and practices on the local Christians
who strongly resented it. The Pledge they took in front of the cross is
part of the declaration of freedom from Portuguese domination, rejecting
the Catholic-Portuguese conventions and defending their own.

More than the religious doctrines and systems of beliefs,
it is the customs and rituals which the people as members of
a community practise which easily stir up their emotions and
feelings. The Hindus, Muslims and the local Christians had
their own customs and rituals before the advent of the foreign
traders. Each community was tolerant towards the customs
and beliefs of the other and the authorities also did not interfere
in such matters. (Even if on certain occasions, certain
rulers had interfered with others' religious beliefs, the people
of their own community hardly supported such actions.)

But, under the British rule, an attitude of deriding other
religious doctrines and faiths and violation of their customs
and rituals came into vogue. This pained both Muslims and
Hindus alike. They lined up against the British rule. Hindu
religious leaders called upon their followers to fight against
the British to protect _Hindu Dharma_. Similarly, the leaders of
the Muslim religion called upon their followers to smash
foreign rule in order to protect their _Deen_.

Among the people's _anti-British_ sentiments, which
originated first in Bengal and South India and later led to
the _sepoy mutiny_ and _people's revolt_, the feeling that caste
rituals and "religious doctrines and beliefs were in danger"
was the most prominent. Whenever the Indian soldiers revolted
against the British rulers, from the local _sepoy mutiny_ in
Vellore in 1806 to the widespread revolt of 1857--59, it was evidently
the feeling that their caste and religion were in danger
that led them to action.

For instance, what led to the Vellore _Sepoy mutiny_ of 1806, was certain orders issued by their superiors about the
dress and bearing of the _sepoys_. These orders banned the
Hindus practice of donning the caste mark of _tilak_ on their
forehead, compelled the Sikhs and Muslims to remove their
beard or hair, and directed the use of caps in place of the headgears
or turbans which the Indians wont to use customarily.
The use of hides and skins of animals in making caps
was also an irritant to the Sepoy, as they did not know as to
which animal hides and skins were being used. All these
measures caused serious concern in the minds of soldiers
belonging to the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh communities. They
suspected that these measurers were a part of the British
conspiracy to get them excommunicated from their community
and then proselytize them to Christianity.

Following these developments, Indian soldiers had revolted
on many occasions against their superior officers. It is
true there were various causes for their resentment, but the
main cause was their suspicion that they would be forced to
renounce their religious beliefs and customs and to embrace
Christianity. The Hindu soldiers resented when they were
ordered to go to war in foreign countries, because crossing
the sea would have invited excommunication in accordance
with the practice prevalent at that time.

Several such incidents constituted the apparent cause
for the 1857 _sepoy mutiny_. The suspicion that animal fat
was used to grease the cartridges caused resentment amongst
the soldiers. The Hindus believed that they would lose
caste if cartridges greased with the fat of cows were used.
Similarly, the Muslims resented the use of grease taken from
boars. In fact, it was this suspicion that instigated the
_sepoys_ to revolt on the 9th of May 1857 in Meerut and
subsequently in other places.

A rationalist or a materialist might dismiss all these as
mere superstition. And they might characterize the soldiers
who revolted on account of such superstitions as obscurantists
and reactionaries. But the fact remains that the generations-old
beliefs, faiths, customs and practices of lakhs
were being violated. As mentioned earlier, these beliefs,
faiths, customs and practices reflected the cultural ethos of
a centuries-old society. That was why the Meerut mutiny
reverberated in several other military centres too.

These feelings stirred up not only the soldiers in the
military camps, but also the civilian population, with no lesser
intensity than in the case of soldiers. The British were
introducing several other measures, which, as in the case of
the measures relating to the dress and bearing and use of
arms by the soldiers, were bound to thoroughly transform
the family life, property rights, education, and cultural
advance of the civilian population.

The abolition of the practice of _Sati_ (the burning of
widow on the funeral pyre of her husband), and the legalization
of widow re-marriage were progressive measures approvable
by a modern society. But these measures were totally
contradictory to the beliefs and practices of the Hindus. The
Muslims felt that if the government which broke the customs
and faiths of the Hindus would also do the same to them.

Both Hindus and Muslims saw the missionary propaganda
of Christianity with the active connivance and
protection of the authorities as an evidence. They even
suspected that the new educational institutions established
by the British government were being used as centres for
proselytization. Thus, Christianity and its propagators roused
the ire and hatred of the entire mass irrespective of Hindu-Muslim
religious differences.

The doctrines, faiths, customs and rituals based on
casteist-religious institutions, were symbols of the collective
life of the Indian society like the political set-up including
the Empire of Delhi and the rulers and provincial-regional
chiefs under it. The socio-cultural structure was also an integral
part of the ancient-medieval Indian society. It was this
system which the European trading companies, from the
very beginning, tried to destroy as they had tried to destroy
the political system consisting of the rulers including the
Emperor of Delhi, _Talukdars_, _Jagirdars_ and other feudal
lords. The rebellions of the _Sanyasis_ and _Fakirs_ on one side,
and the various struggles of the local people on the other
side, culminating in the _sepoy mutiny_ of 1857 and the widespread
_people's revolts_ were struggles against these acts of
the European traders. The defeat sustained by the provincial
rulers and the Emperor of Delhi was, in fact, the defeat
of the old Indian society based on institutions of castes and
religions.

## THE UNWRITTEN SETTLEMENT

Following the suppression of the 1857--59 _Sepoy Mutiny_
and the popular revolt, the new British rulers began to initiate
vindictive measures. Bahadur Shah, who was taken
prisoner, was exiled. Rani of Jhansi and many other leaders
died. Many of those who survived were tried in courts and
sentenced to death or to long periods of imprisonment. The
mutineers and the people who had participated in the rebellion
were subjected to cruel and heinous repression. The
attitude of the British after 1859 was that of a conqueror
towards the vanquished.

They did not conceal this either. British leaders, through
the columns of newspapers, and in speeches in and outside
parliament, demanded that no mercy be shown to those who
rose against them in India.

The British administrators, however, realized that the
feelings roused amongst the people by the mutiny and the
people's rebellion which had lasted nearly two years could
not be suppressed easily through such direct acts of repression.
The role played by the _sepoys_ and the civilian
population in the two-year-long mutiny and rebellion was of
such magnitude as could neither be easily forgotten nor
belittled. They realized that it was a widespread rebellion
in which the princes who were ousted from seats of power,
the feudal lords who had lost their landed properties and
the poorest of the poor people actively participated. They
were afraid that in case the causes that led to the outburst
of the rebellion continued to exist, similar rebellions would
recur in northern India itself, or it would spread to other
regions of the country. They realized that it was necessary
to eliminate these causes in order to maintain their rule.

Following this realization, they brought about some substantial
changes in the policies they had been pursuing till
then. They were conscious of the fact that a foreign government
would not be in a position to redress the grievances of
the masses of people in the villages and urban areas. But it
would be possible for the administrators to placate the feudal
lords, and the heads of casteist and religious institutions who
had played a leading role in turning the dissatisfaction of
the masses into revolts, and transforming such revolts into
an intense armed struggle. It was for this sort of appeasement
that the British administrators were trying.

As we had noticed earlier, a few years prior to 1857,
the British rulers had been pursuing a policy of depriving the
princes, the _Nawabs_ and other rulers and feudal lords like
_Jagirdars_ and _Talukdars_, of 'their rights and privileges and
confiscating their landed properties. That policy had to be
abandoned. There were suspicions amongst the Hindus and
Muslims and other non-Christian sections of the people that
the British were trying to destroy all their religious faiths,
customs and practices. This suspicion had to be removed
 --- that's all.

Accordingly, Queen Victoria made a proclamation before
the people of India on the occasion of her assumption of
power as the Empress of India in 1858. The Proclamation
gave concessions to two important sections of the Indian
people, the native princes and the feudal lords. To the native
princes it gave the undertaking that the British Government
would honour all the agreements hitherto been entered into
between them and the East India Company or their representatives.
The government would guarantee their rights,
privileges and position of honour. To the feudal lords, the
proclamation undertook to preserve their ancestral feudal
properties and all privileges associated with them. It further
assured that in the event of bringing new legislations, it would
give due considerations to the rights, traditions, and customs
and practices which had been extant right from the ancient
times.

Obviously, the Proclamation undertakes to protect not
only the economic interests of the landlords, but also their
privileges as heads of the casteist-religious society and
all the laws, conventions, and the rituals and practices
associated with them.

That is, earlier in the years immediately preceding 1857,
the British had taken a number of steps, such as annexing the
territories ruled by the _Rajahs_ and _Nawabs_, abrogating the
agreements between them and the British, replacing old landlords
by new, bringing under the direct control of the British
the territories of the native princes and the land and properties
of the landlords under the pretext of revenue arrears and
maladministration, refusing to recognize the rights of the
princes and feudal lords to adopt and nominate heirs, and so
on. That was why the feudal elite threw the entire weight
behind the _Sepoy Mutiny_, and the mass revolt. The Proclamation
envisages giving up the _anti-feudal_ approach contained
in these actions and to make efforts to placate and turn them
loyal to the British rule. Similarly, it was also necessary to
take precautions against the communal and religious sentiments
of the people reaching a point of outbreak as it
happened in 1857--59. That was why the Proclamation assured
that the customs, traditions, etc., would be taken into consideration
before introducing new legislative measures.

The proclamation of Queen Victoria thus contained
provisions to appease, at least to some extent, the people of
India who took part in the _Sepoy Mutiny_ and the revolts
and the feudal elite who gave leadership to them as also to
arrive at a compromise with the latter.

There were two faces to this compromise. There was, of
course, no question at all of making a written compromise
settlement directly with those who had participated in a revolt
that was suppressed. But it was possible to have an
unwritten compromise with them. The feudal elite and the
common people who had waged the struggle under the former's
leadership must recognize the fact that the power of
the British government was unassailable and that the British
would rule in such a way as to protect the rights, positions
and properties of the feudal lords and to assure that the
religious faiths and customs of the Indian people (non-Christian)
would not in any way be harmed.

Needless to say, this approach represented a fundamental
departure from the policy that had been pursued by the
East India Company and the British government prior to 1857. This was a move to win over the former _Rajahs_, and
the aristocracy including the feudal elite as allies of the
British rule. A new approach was also adopted to honour the
popular sentiments within the limits of religious practices and
social life in order to ensure that people's discontent that
might arise in the course of the conduct of the administration
of the country with the help of these new allies, did not
burst out in another revolt.

And the elites of the existing Indian society were satisfied
with this. There was no possibility of obtaining any
rights or privileges of a wider extent or of more significance
than what has been assured in the Proclamation. All _ways
and means_ to obtain more powers had ended with the suppression
of the 1857--59 rebellion. As such, the elites of those
times saw that the only way to protect their class interests
was to be satisfied with what they got and to try to ensure
that they get all the rights and privileges that were specified
in the Proclamation, and at the same time, to remain as loyal
subjects of the Empress accepting the rule of her government.

Thus, the Proclamation of Queen Victoria made after
the suppression of the revolt of 1857--59 meant a settlement,
unwritten on the part of the feudal elite and written on the
part of the British rulers. The elite class characterized this
as a "_Magna Carta_" obtained from the British rulers. They
made it clear through words and deeds that they shall ever
remain "loyal and respectful to the rulers who had very
"graciously bestowed" upon them these rights and privileges.

It is for the first time in India's history that a group of
foreigners, keeping their foreign identity --- without getting
merged with the socio-cultural mainstream of this country --- became
the rulers of this country. Never before had a king
or a queen ruled over the princes and people of India sitting
in a throne in a far-off place. But, unlike the different
foreign groups from the Aryans to the Mughals which had
become themselves Indianized and sat at the helm of affairs,
the British were now able to transform the whole Indian
social structure, using an administrative machinery situated 5,000 or more miles away.

However, they had to win over the former rulers and
elite sections, without creating hatred in them and alienating
them. And the elites of this country represented a feudal
(or pre-capitalists) society. There was a basic contradiction
between that society and the capitalist society which the
British represented. This compromise between the foreign
rulers and the native elites, who, by remaining loyal to the
former, were trying to retain their power and position, representing
two mutually contradictory social systems, gave rise
to a number of incongruities. These incongruities have played
their unique roles in the development of events in India in
the years to come. We shall examine them in details in the
next few chapters.

As a beginning of this examination, let us notice here
that there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the wishes
maintained by the British rulers and that of the Indian feudal
aristocracy which now decided to function as subjects loyal
to them. This contradiction is as follows. The task of the
British rulers as representatives of capitalist society was to
cut at the roots of the existing pre-capitalist society evolved
here for centuries. The feudal aristocracy now determined
to function as loyal subjects and to help the British in suppressing
the discontented common people, on the other hand,
wanted to preserve at least the remnant, if not the whole, of
that pre-capitalist society. At the same time, the educated
middle class which considered the _Sepoy Mutiny_ and the
popular revolt reactionary and advised the people to keep
away form them, was baffled at the assurance given by the
British to protect the doctrine, customs and practices which
they considered reactionary.

The British representing _Capitalism_ cannot exist without
strengthening the social forces represented by the educated
middle class. At the same time, to curb the growing dissatisfaction
of the people as an inevitable consequence of the
development of _Capitalism_, they had to enter into a political
alliance with the feudal elites representing the reactionary
forces.

It is out of this contradiction that the next stage of
the struggle of the Indian people for national independence
emerges.

The British rule which got consolidated itself in India
following the suppression of the _Sepoy Mutiny_ and popular
revolt was taking India irresistibly along the path of _Capitalism_.
As an inevitable consequence of this capitalist
development, the roots of the pre-capitalist society were
being cut, one by one. The new social forces born out of the
development of a capitalist society were growing.

At the same time, considering self-existence in the
administrative and political domains, it becomes imperative
for the British to strike a compromise with the declining
pre-capitalist forces. Consequently, the foreign capitalist
rulers and the constantly growing indigenous capitalist
forces came into clash with each other. The latter forces
were striving to bring changes in all aspects of the social life
in accordance with the capitalist forces which were growing as
a consequence of the actions of the British rulers. The alien
character of the foreign rulers, and their dependence on the
representatives of the pre-capitalist society constituted an
obstacle before this.

This situation gives rise to a new movement, rather than
one assuming the form of an armed struggle as of the 1857--59
period, fighting for national independence along the constitutional
and peaceful path led by the very same section of the
society which stood with the British against the _Sepoy Mutiny_
and the popular revolts. Here ends one stage of the national
struggle against the alien rule and begins another. In place
of one form, it assumes another form. The successors of
those who had stood with the mutineers in 1857--59, now
align themselves with the government against the _freedom
struggle_; the successors of those who opposed the _Sepoy
Mutiny_ and _people's revolt_ branding them "reactionary",
now play an active role in the _freedom struggle_.
