# LAST DAYS OF THE WAVELL REGIME

## STRIKES AND PEASANT STRUGGLES

The arguments and counter-arguments centring around the
formation of the interim government and the communal
riots that followed did not complete the picture of Indian
politics in the later half of 1946 and in 1947. While the
tragic drama of communal riots was being enacted in the
different parts of the country, and in parallel to it, certain
other developments also were taking place.

We have dealt earlier with the mass upsurge which had
emerged throughout the country following the end of the
war. Strikes by workers, demonstrations and other forms of
protest action by workers, students and other sections of
the urban masses were widespread in the country. These
were linked with political agitations, too. This was how
agitations embracing all sections of the people developed
against the trial of the _INA_ leaders. It was in the same
atmosphere again that people in thousands came out in
support of the _naval mutiny_ against imperialist domination.

It was, in fact, to stem the tide of this mass upsurge that
the British imperialists devised the evil design to prepare the
grounds to intensify the Hindu-Muslim conflicts leading them
to communal riots, while, at the same time, creating the
impression that efforts were being made to transfer power
to Indians. As a result, communal feelings began to get
strengthened among the poor sections of the people like
workers and peasants leading the less class-conscious among
them to actively participate in the communal riots. However,
the rulers could not completely stem the tide of strikes and
peasant struggles as evident from the following.

In August-September 1946, workers of the _South Indian
Railway_ went on a strike. The authorities let loose cruel
repressions against the striking railwaymen as a result of
which nine were killed and more than a hundred injured in the
police firing. Over 400 workers were arrested. The _AITUC_
gave a call to observe 18th September as a day of solidarity
with the striking railwaymen. In response to this call, rallies
and demonstrations were held in the different parts of the
country and funds collected to help the workers on strike.
The strike which brought the railway traffic to a standstill
for about a month was withdrawn only after Asaf Ali, the
Minister of Railways in the interim government, gave assurances
to the workers on their demands.

Workers of the _North Western Railway_ also launched a
strike almost during the same period. As was the case with
the strike in the _South Indian Railway_, Communists and the
_AITUC_ were in the forefront of this strike. Although there
was a union led by the _Muslim League_ in the NW Railway,
the union led by the Communists was able to surge ahead of
all other unions, including the one led by the _League_. Later,
workers under its leadership courageously fought against the
communal riots in the north-western region until the partition
of the country.

Among the strikes launched in other sectors during the 1946--47 period, the strikes of the textile workers in Bombay,
Nagpur and Kanpur and those of the workers of the coal mines
in Giridih in Bihar, workers of the Kolar gold mines in
Mysore, the port workers of Calcutta deserve particular
mention. In many of these strikes several workers were killed
and several more injured in police firing.

A notable feature of the series of strikes launched during
the post-war years was that a large section of middle class
employees including government servants had entered the strike movement. The country-wide strike of the employees
of the Post and Telegraph Department was, in fact, the forerunner
of the strikes of the government employees in Madras
and in other provinces. Neither the trade union workers nor
the government employees had ever thought that it was possible
to link the agitations and struggles of the government
employees with those of the organized working class. The
special feature of the 1946--47 strike movement was that it
marked the beginning of the efforts in that direction.

It was an upsurge of the working class embracing the
movements in the _Princely States_ more extensively than ever
before. The strikes which were launched by the working
class in the states like Travancore, Hyderabad, Mysore,
Indore, etc., were linked with the political movements
being conducted by the democrats in the respective states.
Working _class struggles_ in Travancore and Hyderabad had
played significant roles in the development of the movements
of Punnapra-Vayalar and Telangana, respectively, which
represented the highest form of the _people's struggles_ in the
_Princely States_.

A revolutionary upsurge was witnessed also among the
peasantry during the same period. In April 1945, immediately
before the end of the war in Europe, a conference of
the _All-India Kisan Sabha_ was held in the Netra Kona Village
in the Mymansingh district of East Bengal (now in Bangladesh).
In the conference and also in the meetings of the
_Kisan Council_ that followed, the problems affecting the
peasants as well as the common problems affecting the people
were discussed elaborately and a call was given to build a
broad based mass movement with a view to find solutions
to these problems. These developments prepared the ground
for mass based peasant struggles in all the provinces side by
side the working class strikes.

Even before the Netra Kona session of the _Kisan Sabha_,
the peasants in Bengal had been raising the slogan of reducing
the share of the landowners (_jotedars_) to one-third
instead of the existing one-half of the crops raised by the
cultivating peasants (share-croppers). The resulting movement
known by the generic name of the _Tebhaga_ movement
received a new impetus from the _Kisan conference_. Thus,
while the discussions with the _Cabinet Mission_ and other
political developments were taking place, the tide of the
_Tebhaga_ movement in Bengal was rising high.

Peasant struggles based on similar partial, immediate
demands of the peasantry were going on in many other
provinces. But the _Tebhaga_ movement was distinct from the
peasant movements in other parts of the country on two
counts. First, in all other provinces the peasant movement
was confined to certain regions, whereas in Bengal the
movement was spread all over the province. For example,
in Kerala the movement of the peasants to establish their
right to pay the rent to the landlord in cash was confined to
the northern part of the erstwhile Malabar district. Similarly,
in Andhra, the peasant movement (except the Telangana
movement) was largely confined to the Krishna, Guntur and
Godavari districts. Again, in Maharashtra the peasant
movement was purely confined to the centres of the Warli
peasants embracing one or two _taluks_.

_Second_, peasants in both the Muslim majority East
Bengal and the Hindu majority West Bengal equally participated
in the struggle. It may even be stated that the
movement in the East was somewhat more powerful than in
the West. It may be noted that the entire peasantry, irrespective
of religious affiliations, were fighting against the
_jotedars_ in the Muslim majority region of a province in which
a political party (the _Muslim League_) functioning on the
basis of the argument that the Muslims are a separate
nation, was in power. And it was the _Muslim League_
ministry which resorted to repressive actions against these
struggles with a determination to suppress them. The Hindu
and Muslim _jotedars_ who were quarrelling with each other on
the issues of future constitution and the interim government
extended full support to these repressive actions of the
_League_ government.

The _Tebhaga_ movement and the _Kisan Sabha_ played a
unique role in resisting the communal riots in Bengal and
Bihar. It may be specifically noted that the riots did not
break out in those areas in the Noakhali-Tippera districts of
Bengal in which the _Kisan Sabha_ had considerable influence.
In such areas the _Kisan Sabha_ and the activists of the _Tebhaga_
movement organized relief camps for the refugees from the
riot affected neighbouring areas. Similarly, in Moghpur in
the Monghyr district of Bihar, the _Communist Party_, _Kisan
Sabha_ and other mass organizations organized relief activities
to protect the people in the riot stricken areas and to provide
relief to the victims of the communal riots. In the urban
areas, the trade unions and students organizations were active
in the relief operations. Both in the rural and urban areas
the _Communist Party_ was in the forefront in giving leadership
to these activities.

This and the activities of Gandhi in Noakhali were
apparently the same. Both were pained by the sight of
people, who ought to have lived as brethren, cutting each
other's throat and both expressed their intense desire to stop
it. However, they were poles apart on the answer to the
question as to how such a situation came about and how to
get out of it. The _Communist Party_ regarded that the way
to stop all quarrels and to forge unity among the different
communities was to wage an uncompromising struggle against
the British rulers and organized struggles of workers
and peasants against capitalists and landlords based on their
grievances and demands. Gandhi, on the other hand, had
been engaged in giving advice and directions to the Congress
leaders in their negotiations for a compromise with the
British government. He had no sympathy towards workers'
and peasants' struggles.

But the atmosphere of communal riots did not cease to
exist, as desired by Gandhi and the _Communist Party_; on the
contrary the conflicts were getting sharper day by day. Finally,
in the midst of the worst kind of human tragedy, two
independent countries, Indian Union and Pakistan, emerged.

Could this have been avoided? It is difficult to answer
this question. But the _Communist Party_, one among those
which tried to avoid it, was not powerful enough to effectively
challenge the policies pursued by the leaders of the
Congress and the _League_. Gandhi without being conscious
of the need to challenge these policies was, on the other
hand, blessing the politics of compromise of the Congress
leaders. The political approach of the top _bourgeois_ leadership
of the Congress and the _League_, including Gandhi, and
the policy of disintegration pursued by the _League_ leadership
together with the efforts made by the British rulers to utilize
both these factors to preserve their dominance made Indian
partition and the widespread communal riots inevitable.

Gandhi could not do anything other than feeling pained
to have to see the mission of his life failing. The _Communist
Party_, on the other hand, was not strong enough to bring
into action what it thought correct and clear. Thus, Indian
politics which had been the plaything of the British rulers
as well as of the leaders of the Congress and the _League_
moved from one crisis to another.

## PUNNAPRA-VAYALAR AND TELANGANA

The struggles in Punnapra-Vayalar in Travancore and
in Telangana in Hyderabad represented the highest from of
the post-war revolutionary struggles. In many respects, those
struggles were similar in nature. For example, both Travancore
and Hyderabad were _Princely States_ and in both the states
agitations for _responsible government_ were making great
strides. In both the states there was a developed _Communist
Party_. The princely rulers of both the states were striving to
safeguard their status in the background of the discussions
being held among the representatives of the British government,
the Congress and the _League_. The _Communist Party_
which had been playing a decisive role in developing popular
agitations against these manoeuvres had been able to enhance
its influence among the _non-Communist_ democrats in both
the states.

In many other respects these struggles were also dissimilar.
In Travancore, the ruler and a majority of the population
were Hindus whereas in Hyderabad the ruler was a Muslim
and a majority of the population were Hindus. The _Muslim
League_ had been trying to include Hyderabad in Pakistan in
the event of Indian partition. Whether it joined Pakistan or
it was maintained as an independent state, a state of Hyderabad
which was not part of India would constitute a danger
to the security of India. Therefore, the Congress wanted to
make Hyderabad a part of India. That is, Hyderabad occupied
a vital place in the conflicts between the Congress and the
_League_. As for Travancore, there was no question of joining
Pakistan. But the rulers declared their intention to remain
an 'independent' country without joining Hindustan, either.
Based on this, an "Independent Travancore" movement
had come into existence there. Besides, in place of the
democratic demand of a _responsible government_ in the sense
that it should be responsible to an elected legislature, the
rulers of Travancore raised the issue of establishing a constitutional
system with a government not responsible to a
legislature which may be an elected one. Since the contemplated
system was on the model of the presidential system
of America, it was named "American Model".

If the contemplated system of "Independent Travancore"
in the "American Model" was to come into force, it
would be extremely dangerous to the entire _bourgeois_
democratic movement, for the "American Model" was a
negation of the democratic objective which the freedom
movement had been upholding from its very inception. In
addition, the existence of an independent country with a
long sea coast at one end of India would bring danger to
India's security. Therefore, a state-wide agitation arose
against the ideas of 'Independent Travancore' and 'American
Model' with the _Communist Party_ in the forefront.

Another factor which distinguished Travancore and
Hyderabad from one another relates to the social organizations
and class relations existing in the two states. In
Travancore, there was a fairly organized working class.
Right from the agitations for _responsible government_ in 1938,
the working class had effectively used general strike, a
weapon characteristic of that class. As the strike helped the
agitation for _responsible government_, the agitation in turn
(helped the growth of the working class. In Travancore, the
_Communist Party_ was born in the background in which
democratic struggles of the people and the independent workers'
struggles were helping and relying on each other. Consequently,
the _Communist Party_ in Travancore was the political
party of the working class as well as the vanguard of the
democratic movement in the full sense.

That was not the position in Hyderabad. True, there
was a kind of trade union developed in the capital city of
Hyderabad and there were militant strikes immediately
before the beginning of the _Telangana struggle_. But the
_Communist Party_ had no influence in the trade union movement
to any considerable extent. The main strong-holds of
the Party were in the rural areas and that, too, in the Telugu
speaking Telangana region. Although there were democratic
movements against the princely rule in the Marathi and
Kannada-speaking regions in the state, these movements were
under _bourgeois_ leadership. The influence of the _Communist
Party_ was weak in these movements. Thus, the Party in
Hyderabad was confined to the Telugu-speaking region of
Telangana relying mainly on the peasantry. The peasant
unions and the _Andhra Mahasabha_ were the mass organizations
involved in the _Telangana struggle_.

The distinction between Travancore and Telangana in
regard to the class relations that had existed amongst the people
and the mass base of the _Communist Party_ may be found
reflected in the nature and development of the Punnapra-Vayalar
and _Telangana struggle_s. The coir workers in the
Ambalappuzha ane Sherthalai _taluks_ with a fighting tradition
of over a decade and their fighting organizations together
with the repressive actions taken by the rulers to suppress
the workers constituted the political background which led
to the _Punnapra-Vayalar struggle_. In Hyderabad, on the
other hand, the discontent of the Telugu-speaking peasantry
towards the feudal elements, called the _Deshmukhs_, and the
aspirations of the Andhra nationality led to the _Telangana
struggle_.

Although the workers in Alleppey and the _Communist
Party_ in the whole of Kerala had taken part in the mass upsurge
against the feudal-_jenmi_ elements in the Ambalappuzha-Sherthalai
_taluks_ only weeks before the outbreak of the
_Punnapra-Vayalar struggle_, the _Communist Party_ there could
not rise to the position of the leader of the peasant masses. (In
Kerala, the peasant movement emerged and peasant struggles
fought in the erstwhile Malabar district of Madras and its
influence did not extend to Travancore.) In contrast to this,
the working class had no direct role in the Telangana movement,
although the Communist movement there, like elsewhere,
was based on working class ideologies and outlook.

There was also a difference in the course of these two
struggles. The _Punnapra-Vayalar struggle_ developed rapidly
into a conflict between the armed volunteers of the working
class and the state army and got suppressed --- all in the matter
of a few weeks. The _Telangana struggle_, on the other hand,
was a peasant revolutionary struggle lasting for about five
years during which more than 4000 Communists and peasant
activists were killed and over 10,000 Communists and
workers of mass movements were thrown behind the bars for
long periods. As a result of this long-drawn-out struggle,
'_Gram Raj_' was established in 3000 villages covering an area
of 10,000 square miles with a population of about three
million. The people's organizations and the volunteer force
seized about a million acres of land from the landlords and
distributed them among the peasants. Minimum wage
of agricultural workers was fixed, and they were liberated
from the social-feudal oppressions. Such a long-drawn-out
revolutionary movement with far-reaching effects of this kind
had never taken place anywhere in India before. What was
expressed in these two struggles was the efforts made by the
princely rulers of these states to sustain their autocratic rule
in the background of the negotiations on the future constitution
being carried on by the leaders of the Congress and the
_League_ and the protests of the democratic minded people
against these efforts. Consequently, the impact of the _Punnapra-Vayalar
struggle_ remained in the politics of Travancore
even after it was suppressed. Although the armed conflict had
ended, the democratic minded people in the state, inspired by
the struggle, continued their political struggles raising the
slogans of "_End the Dewan Rule_", "_Dump Independent
Travancore and the American Model in the Arabian Sea_",
etc. Until the rulers, isolated from the people, retraced their
steps, the politics of Punnapra-Vayalar remained relevant in
the state.

The rulers of Hyderabad held on for about another year
after the establishment of a _responsible government_ in Travancore.
Finally, the Indian army had to intervene to
force the rulers to surrender, following which Hyderabad
joined the Indian Union and a _responsible government_ established
there. The political situation changed after these
developments. As the _bourgeois_ democrats withdrew their
support to the movement following these developments, the
Telangana movement lost the popular support of an important
section which had remained behind the movement until
the surrender of the _Nizam_.

From this brief description, it will be clear that Punnapra-Vayalar
and the _Telangana struggle_s formed an integral
part of the post-war revolutionary upsurge in India. Therefore,
as the Indian political situation which formed the basis
of this revolutionary upsurge underwent a fundamental change
with the establishment of a _bourgeois_ democratic system
at the centre and in the provinces including the _Princely
States_, the political base of these struggles disappeared.

Since the _Communist Party_ had been playing a leading
role in both these struggles, the march to the revolutionary
future as visualized by the Party became more unhindered.
The _bourgeois_ parliamentary elections held after these two
struggles demonstrated the premier position of the _Communist
Party_ in the Andhra districts including the Telangana
region and in the districts of Kerala including the Ambalappuzha-Shethalai
_taluks_. It became clear that the _Communist
Party_ was one of the foremost political parties that emerged
in the post-independent Indian political scene.

We have explained earlier the circumstance which led
to the suppression of the _naval mutiny_ of February 1946. The
same can be applied to the Punnapra-Vayalar and _Telangana
struggle_s as well. The different streams of people's actions
and feelings like the discontent among the ranks of the
British Indian armed forces, the widespread workers strikes
and peasant struggles of 1945--46, the agitations of the
people in the _Princely States_ throughout the length and
breadth of the country and the preparedness of the people
to carry on armed struggles as witnessed in the Punnapra-Vayalar
and in Telangana --- each of these streams passed
through little channels and finally petered out, rather than
joining together to make up a mighty turbulent river of
revolution. Each of these struggles was isolated and suppressed
as and when it occurred.

The leftist parties including the _Communist Party_ were
not strong enough to unify them and convert them into a
single comprehensive revolutionary upsurge. The _bourgeois_
leadership of the independence movement, on the other
hand, adopted the course of bargain and compromise, instead
of revolutionary struggles. The result? The British rulers
could convert the popular feelings into Hindu-Muslim riots.

## CRISES IN THE INTERIM GOVERNMENT

For over six months after the formation of the interim
government, Wavell remained as the Viceroy. This period
was marked by constant conflicts between the Congress and
the _League_, on the one hand, and between the Congress and
the British authorities, on the other. As a result, the functioning
of the interim government often came to a standstill. The
events that took place during this period were such that
everyone was convinced that a united independent India was
impossible to realize.

At the provincial level, in Sind and Bengal where _League_
ministries were in power, the Viceroy and the Governors
were in full cooperation with the provincial ministries and
the ruling party, whereas in the provinces ruled by the Congress,
they were indifferent if not hostile to the ministries.
The Viceroy even ventured to prevent Nehru's protest note
being forwarded to the Secretary of State and openly defended
the Governors of the _League_-ruled provinces. A more important
incident was the attempt made by the British authorities
to prevent Nehru's visit to the NWF Province after the formation
of the interim government.

The subject of tribal affairs in the interim government
was directly under Nehru and the NWF Province was ridden
with tribal problems. As such, no one could object to his
visiting the province. But his visit to the NWF Province
had a political significance. Although the Muslims constitute 97 percent of the population of the NWF Province, the
_League_ was polled less than 30 percent of the votes. In the
circumstance, his visit to the province would not remain purely
official; it would change into a political visit challenging
the claims made by the _League_. Therefore, the Governor
himself proceeded to Delhi to request Nehru to defer his
plan to visit the province. When this became of no avail,
the British officials encouraged the _League_ in organizing antiNehru
demonstrations during his visit. Later, in a letter to
Mountbatten, Governor Olaf Caroe blamed Nehru's holding
the portfolio of tribal affairs for the whole trouble.

This was by no means an isolated incident. This and
similar other incidents were part of the scheme consciously
devised by the British authorities to put as many obstructions
as possible before the Congress after the formation of the interim
government. They fully utilized the anti-Congress
feelings of the _League_ for this purpose.

With the entry of the _League_ in the interim government,
the problem of distribution of portfolios came up. Wavell
supported the _League_ in its claim either to external affairs
or to home, which were being handled by Nehru and Patel,
respectively. When the Congress refused to part with either
of these subjects, it was feared at one stage that the entire
plan of Wavell would break down. Finally, the _League_ had
to be contented with the finance portfolio. What prevented
the interim government from breaking up at that stage was
the thinking among the _League_ leaders that to have a share
in the government was far more important than getting bold
of this or that portfolio, lest the Congress be the sole ruling
party in the country.

When the _League_ joined the government, the _CongressLeague_
conflicts were extended to the level of administration
also, providing opportunity for the Viceroy to act as an
arbiter. In order to avoid it, it was suggested that the
ministers meet informally and arrive at an understanding and
based on this understanding take decisions formally at the
Cabinet meeting. But this arrangement did not work. Instead,
the Congress and _League_ ministers met separately in groups.
It may be noted that the ministers who did not belong to
either of the parties attended the Congress group meetings.
Thus, the interim government turned into a scene of conflicts
between these two camps. The Viceroy got the opportunity to
sharpen the conflicts between the Congress and the _League_ by
functioning as an arbiter between the two.

The _League_ had made it clear earlier that they were
joining the interim government as it would facilitate the
formation of Pakistan. And they adopted an approach
towards the _Constituent Assembly_ suited to service this purpose.
They argued that the members elected to the _Constituent
Assembly_ from the west should be grouped into two
sections and the members in these two sections should frame
the constitution for their respective sections and that the
provinces belonging to these sections would be bound by the
decisions taken by the sections by a majority vote. According
to the _League_, this was the essence of the scheme prepared
by the _Cabinet Mission_.

This was not acceptable to the Congress. They demanded
that each province belonging to these sections should have
the right to decide its own future. They further demanded
that any dispute arising out of this should be referred to the
Federal Court for its decision.

Since the two parties could not reach an agreement on
this issue, the Viceroy had not called for the _Constituent
Assembly_ to meet. Finally, under the pressure from Nehru,
he called for the session of the Assembly. The _League_ strongly
protested against this.

The first session of the _Constituent Assembly_ was scheduled
to be held on 9th December. But it was made clear
that the _League_ would not participate in it. It had also
become clear that even if the _League_ did not participate, the
work of the _Constituent Assembly_ would proceed with the
participation of all the _non-League_ members of the Assembly,
The dispute between the Congress and the _League_ on this
issue led to a political deadlock. Outside the government
and the Assembly, the people who had rallied behind these
parties had begun to move in the direction of communal riots.

The British government once again intervened in the
Indian affairs. Prime Minister Attlee invited the leaders of
the Congress and the _League_ to London for a discussion.
The Sikh minister Sardar Baldev Sing was also invited to
join the talks. Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan went to London
to participate in the discussions representing the _League_.
The Congress first declined the invitation, but later agreed
to participate in the talks in London.

The talks in London did not help solve the problem.
The British government made a declaration accepting the
interpretation given by the _League_ with regard to the provisions
of section meetings contained in the scheme of the
_Cabinet Mission_. As an attempt to solace the Congress, the
British government further declared that any dispute over
interpretations on this issue could be referred to the Federal
Court. This decision naturally left the Congress dissatisfied.

The situations in India began to deteriorate again. The
_AICC_ met in January 1947 and adopted a resolution to the
effect that there should be no compulsion on a province to
join a section and that the rights of the Sikhs in Punjab
should not be endangered. The resolution also declared that
if there was an attempt to compel a province to join a
section, then a province or a part of a province should have
the right to take whatever action as required to give effect
to the wishes of the people concerned.

Following, a meeting of the _Working Committee_ of the
_League_ was held and adopted a resolution stating that the
Congress had now openly rejected the scheme of the _Cabinet
Mission_ and demanding dissolution of the _Constituent Assembly_
constituted in accordance with the scheme of the
_Cabinet Mission_ which had been rejected by the Congress
as well as the Sikhs and the Scheduled Castes who stood with
the Congress. The Congress, on the other hand, demanded
removal from the interim government the ministers of the
_League_ who not only refused to attend the _Constituent
Assembly_ but also demanded its dissolution. The Congress
raised the complaint that the Viceroy and other British
officials were rendering all kinds of assistance to the _League_.
As a protest against this attitude of the British authorities,
the _non-League_ ministers threatened to resign from the
interim government. The Congress leaders tactfully suggested
to the British government the removal of Wavell from the
viceregal position.

While the Congress and _League_ leaders were in London
in December, certain moves were made by the British
government to change the Viceroy. We shall see more
about it in the next section. Here, it may be noted that
the Viceroy came to realize that things in India were not
moving the way he wished. He had thought that after the
formation of the interim government first without the _League_
and later with _League_'s participation, he would be able to
control the situation by acting an arbiter between the two
contending parties. That hope had now belied. On the
contrary, it became obvious now that the policy of divide
and rule' which the British authorities, including himself,
had been pursuing might lead to a civil strife in India. He
feared that the responsibility for such a situation would rest
solely upon the British authorities. In order to avoid it,
Wavell formulated a plan to phase out the British forces
from India. The British government, however, rejected his
plan thinking that it would constitute an admission of
defeat. They came to the conclusion that it was essential to
formulate a new approach towards India and to have a
new Viceroy capable of functioning in accordance with it.

## WAVELL AND MOUNTBATTEN

The announcement made by Prime Minister Attlee on 20th February 1947 was in recognition of the need to adopt
a new approach to find a solution to the problems arising
out of the rapidly deteriorating situations in India. The
announcement which was often considered "historic" expressed
their "definite intention to leave India" by a date not later
than June 1948 handing over power to a Central government
formed on the basis of a constitution agreed upon by
the parties concerned or in the absence of it, to "some form
of Central Government" as a whole or "in some areas to
the existing Provincial Governments. ... " Attlee also announced
the appointment of Lord Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied
Commander in the South-East Asia, as the new Viceroy.

The news media had from the beginning tried hard to
build the image of Mountbatten as a person lacking the
faults which Wavell had and possessing the merits which he
lacked. The admirers of Mountbatten have praised the
"unusual abilities" of Mountbatten and Lady Mountbatten,
the part played by the new Viceroy in the British efforts to
"free India" as a whole, if possible, otherwise in two parts,
etc. Conscious efforts have been made to create the impression
that "_Freedom at Midnight_" became a reality because
the "unimaginative" Wavell was replaced by the "imaginative"
Mountbatten as the Viceroy. This was reinforced by
the fact that the Congress requested Mountbatten to continue
as the first Governor-General of Free India.

It is not true to state that Wavell was against the idea
of Britain leaving India handing over power to the Indians.
It many be recalled that Wavell had placed the proposal
before the Secretary of State for India that since it would be
futile to attempt to bring about an agreement between the
Congress and the _League_, the British should be ready to
leave India in a phased manner. Although different in form
and details, the same idea was contained in the announcement
made by Attlee. It is thus clear that the "imaginative"
Mountbatten and Attlee and the "unimaginative " Wavell
alike recognized the fact that the British rulers would not be
able to hold on to power in India for long.

It was widely propagated that Wavell was inimical to
the Congress and friendly to the _League_, while Mountbatten
was the other way round. This was baseless. For, as we
have seen earlier, it was Wavell who took the initiative to
form the interim government under the leadership of the
Congress but excluding the _League_ and also convened the
_Constituent Assembly_ on the face of opposition from the
_League_. At the same time, it was the British government
that made an announcement in favour of the _League_ when
the dispute arose between the Congress and the _League_ over
the right of the provinces grouped in the different sections
in accordance with the scheme of the _Cabinet Mission_.
Mountbatten was, in fact, appointed Viceroy to implement
the decision taken in favour of the _League_.

All this, however, does not mean that there was no distinction
between Wavell and Mountbatten or between
Wavell and Attlee. Nor does it mean that differences in
personalities and their approaches did not affect political
developments. There were, however, certain approaches of
fundamental nature adopted by the ruling classes of Britain
above personal characteristics and approaches. Wavell,
Mountbatten, Attlee, Cripps, Pethick-Lawrence and all
others, including the out-and-out conservative Winston Churchill,
were handling the Indian question subject to this
fundamental approach of the ruling classes. None could
deviate from this approach. The central point of this approach
was that the British would not be able to hold on to
power for long after the war. How to get out of India was
the only question over which they had differed from one
another. Wavell was of the opinion that it was futile to hold
negotiations with Indian political leaders and that Britain
should withdraw from India in a phased manner. Attlee and
his colleagues who did not agree with this thought that
Britain should consult with Indian political leaders and leave
India with their consent. In taking the decision to change
the Viceroy, they were led by the understanding that Wavell
was incapable of getting their consent by negotiating with
them in accordance with this new approach, whereas Mountbatten
would be able to do it.

The British rulers were unanimous in the opinion that
in the event of the British leaving India, power should be
handed over to a coalition government of the Congress and
the _League_ by bring about an agreement between them, or,
if this was not possible, to two governments by dividing India
into two.

Some among the British rulers like Attlee, Cripps, and
Mountbatten had closer relations with Nehru and certain
other Congress leaders. For that reason, the _League_ leaders
looked upon them with suspicion. All the schemes formulated
by the British beginning from the 1942 _Cripps Mission_
contained the dichotomy of Hindu India and Muslim India.
Autonomy to the Muslim majority provinces and the right
to from groups constituted the common factor of all these
schemes. The _League_ had the hope and the Congress
the fear that this would lead to the realization of the _League_'s
objective of Pakistan. The _Cripps Mission_ and other schemes
formulated by the British government reinforced this feeling.
Further, as we have repeatedly stated, the central point of
dispute between the Congress and the _League_ since the formation
of the interim government was the problems relating
to the sections' and the rights of the provinces grouped into
these sections. The judgement awarded by the British government
on this dispute went in favour of the _League_.

In other words, the British rulers were unanimous in the
view that they would not be able to hang on to power in
India for long and that in the event of their leaving India,
no Muslim majority province should be allowed to opt out
of Pakistan even if it decides that way. The difference of
opinion among them was over the question of how to hand
over power to the Congress and the _Muslim League_. Here
Mountbatten had certain advantages over Wavell.

_First_, Mountbatten was a newcomer to Indian politics
and government. Unlike Wavell who had to deal with the
Congress during the _Quit India Struggle_ as the Commander-in-Chief
of the British forces in India, Mountbatten was
free from being the object of people's prejudice. His appointment
as the Viceroy at the juncture helped him to create the
impression as 'an administrator to implement a new policy'.

_Second_, his relation with the British royal family, the
stories that got around about his experience of leadership in
a vital area during the war and his ability to deal with people
had raised expectation that he would be able to face
complex political situation in India. The personal behaviour
of Lady Mountbatten added strength to this expectation.

_Third_, the friendship which had developed between
Nehru and Mountbatten while he was the Supreme Commander
stationed at Singapore had helped the conduct of
negotiations later when he became the Viceroy.

Finally and more importantly, perhaps, he did not attract
the hatred of Jinnah as the personal friend of Nehru. This
was mainly because Jinnah was conscious of the nature of the
scheme Mountbatten was going to implement. Jinnah was
certain that whatever Mountbatten might do while maintaining
friendship with Nehru, he would be able to turn it in his
favour. Both before and after the arrival of Mountbatten,
Jinnah acted as a lawyer-politician proficient in negotiations.
Consequently, Mountbatten was able to adopt an approach
based on the friendship with Nehru and avoiding confrontations
with Jinnah.

It must, however, be stated that these personal qualities
and capabilities might not have shone but for the political
situation prevailing then. The Congress leaders had accepted
the partition of India as a reality. They had accepted the sections
system contained the long-term scheme of the _Cabinet
Mission_. They had only insisted that the provinces which
are grouped into the different sections should not be forcibly
merged either in India or Pakistan. They had also recognized
the reality that India would have to be divided as
a logical extension of the operation of this provision. They
now only insisted that just like the division of India, the
provinces of Punjab, Bengal and Assam should also be divided.

In other words, while opposing Jinnah's slogan of 'Divide
India and Quit', the Congress had adopted the state of
mind in effect to bring this slogan in force. Mountbatten had
only to accomplish the task of determining the details of
Indian partition which was being realized through bargains
between the Congress and the _League_.
