_The Supreme Court, which is
hearing writ petitions on the
Salwa Judum in Chhattisgarh
asked the National Human Rights
Commission to constitute a fact
finding committee that would
prepare a report on allegations
"relating to violation of human
rights by the _Naxalites_ and
Salwa Judum". The report,
prepared by a group set up by the
police wing of the NHRC makes
no pretence of neutrality or
objectivity. It reads like a partisan
statement, whose tone and tenor
is to protect the Salwa Judum and
its image from being tarnished by
allegations of crime._

The _Salwa Judum_ phenomenon has
occasioned a number of reports,
most of them strongly critical and
the patronage it gets from the State in
Chhattisgarh. Not many who know the
situation in Dantewada (now Dantewada
and Bijapur) districts of the state and who
are fair-minded would quarrel with the
criticism, though there can be and there
are differences in the assessment of what
exactly the _Salwa Judum_ signifies. But
the fair-minded observer would be
disturbed by the almost total absence of
any critical comment on the _Maoists_ in
most of the reports.

While the fair-minded would only be disturbed,
any partisan of counter-insurgency
as practised in the jungles and villages
of south Bastar could be expected to find
it intolerable, and it was always a matter
of time before someone would come out
with a vengeful parody of the discomfiting
silence. Such a parody has now come
out, but its author is not some crony of
Mahendra Karma but the _National
Human Rights Commission_ (_NHRC_). The
report produced by the _NHRC_ after conducting
an inquiry as directed by the
Supreme Court easily signifies the lowest
point in that institution's decade and a
half of existence.

The Supreme Court has been hearing
two writ petitions questioning the collusive
impunity given to the private militia
known as _Salwa Judum_ by the government
of Chhattisgarh. Some of the petitioners
are concerned outsiders who have
personally visited the affected areas and
seen the situation for themselves. And
some are local people, tribal residents of
the affected area. They set out in detail
the vicious violence of the _Salwa Judum_
and the State's complicity with it. Anyone
who knows anything about Dantewada
post-June 2005 knows that whole villages
have been set on fire and hundreds of
people have been massacred by the _Salwa
Judum_ in villages lying along a wide
swathe running along the south and
south-west of the undivided Dantewada
district, abutting Khammam district of
Andhra Pradesh.

# Fact Finding Committee

The Supreme Court felt it necessary to
have a report on the allegations ("relating to
violation of human rights by the _Naxalites_
and the _Salwa Judum_ and living conditions
in the refugee colonies"), and chose
the _NHRC_ to do the job. The Court did not
ask for conclusive investigation of the
complaint, offence by offence. It asked the
_NHRC_ to examine/verify the allegations by
appointing "an appropriate fact finding
committee with such members as it deems
fit". The _NHRC_ need not have appointed a
committee out of its own members. It
could have chosen persons of some experience
in such matters, and fairness of mind.
Or it could have formed a committee of
insiders consisting of its members with a
judicial/administrative background. For
reasons best known to it, however, the
_NHRC_ directed its police wing to constitute
a fact finding committee. The Director
General (Investigation) of the _NHRC_, perhaps
inevitably, constituted a team consisting
of three officers of the _Indian Police
Service_ (_IPS_) and other lesser police functionaries
under his supervision.

It was an unfortunate choice on all
counts, and the report shows that in ample
measure. Police officers --- retired or in
service, corrupt or upright --- have generally
expressed great appreciation of _Salwa
Judum_. Forever looking at _armed insurgencies_
from the point of view of _armed
counter-insurgency_, they have seen in
them an ideal tool: a vigilante group of
tribal communities that can be passed off as
a _people's uprising_ and conveniently endowed
with the impunity required to do
the State's dirty work. The report shows
that mere employment in the _NHRC_ does
nothing to change a policeman's (or woman's)
spots. A human rights perspective on
insurgency or armed militancy, whether it
has a slight or a substantial popular base,
is not easy for even the most steadfast
democrat. Policemen and women with
their occupational distaste for usurpation
of their excusive monopoly of weapons
will be the last to arrive at it. To constitute
a team consisting wholly of police officers
to enquire into the Dantewada (we will
employ this as short for Dantewada and
Bijapur) situation was a most unhappy decision,
and tells poorly of the _NHRC_'s understanding
of its task.

The report makes no pretence of neutrality
or objectivity. It has a 13-page introduction
which is mostly a harsh comment
on the _Naxalites_, described at the very
outset as a "menace", followed by a fivepage
chapter titled "Human Rights Violations
by the _Naxalites_". The third chapter
of just one and a half pages is on "Human
Rights Violations by _Salwa Judum_" and
another one and a half pages on the "Role
of the Local Police, Security Forces and
_SPOs_". It concludes almost regretfully that
the _Salwa Judum_ is no longer able to function
outside the relief camps. And then
there is a lengthy chapter running into 67
pages titled "Findings" which gives the
report of the team's investigation into the
allegations listed in the writ petitions.

# _Maoist_ Actions

It may be added that the _Maoists_ did nothing
to lessen the prejudice. While the
enquiry was going on, they blew up high
tension electricity transmission lines plunging
the entire region (four districts, to be
precise) in darkness for about 10 days. It
was a senseless thing to have done at any
time, but a foolish act to boot when an enquiry
by the _NHRC_ into the very allegations
the _Maoists_ have been making for about
three years was on. Those who are not
familiar with their ways may find it
strange that they chose just this time to
do indulge in such destruction, but such
want of appositeness is not strange or
new with them. Whether they admit to
it or not, such expression of contempt of
institutions and processes of public
justice under the State is quite common
with the _Maoists_, though it has never prevented
them from demanding enquiries
and lawful action by such institutions
against perpetrators of what they believe
to be injustice.

The _NHRC_ team's strong prejudice
against the _Naxalites_ comes through in
every sentence of the sections dealing with
them. In fact, reading the report, one would
be at a loss to know why the _Naxalites_ are
at all there: it appears that their only activity
has been to oppress the people. The
minimum of credit normally given to them
even by the unsympathetic middle class,
namely that they put an end to extortion
by unscrupulous traders and corrupt civil
servants, finds no place in the report. An
allegation which those who have spent
many more days in the area than the _NHRC_
team have never heard, finds place in the
report, namely that "as per the diktat of
the _Naxalites_, none of the tribal children
was allowed to continue his/her education
beyond the fifth standard". It is almost
certainly an invention of the roadside relief
camps. Interestingly, the statements
against the _Naxalites_ are listed out without
necessarily prefixing them with a suitably
cautious "alleged" or "supposed" (of
the 16 allegations listed out in the first
three pages of the report, only one is
graced with the prefix "alleged" and another
with "reported"), but about the large
mass of tribals from Chhattisgarh who
have run away to Andhra Pradesh it is said
that they were "allegedly" displaced by
the _Salwa Judum_. Could they have gone
on a picnic?

The prejudice comes out most starkly in
the reference to _tendu patta_ in paragraph
1.29. It is stated about the _adivasis_ that
"_Tendu leaves_ are the most important
source of their income", which is substantially
true. It is then added that "the
control exercised by the _Naxalites_ over
the collection and fixation of _tendu patta_
rates also caused indignation amongst
the tribals". Between these two statements
there should, in all fairness, be
two more. One, the terrible exploitation
of tribals by the _tendu patta_ contractors
who got the strenuous job of collecting the
jungle leaf done for a pittance before the
_Naxalites_ entered the picture. Two, the
fact that _Naxalite_ intervention increased
the payment manifold (about 50 times, in
fact) over the period of 20 to 25 years that
they have been active in the area. This is
not an exorbitant increase wrought by
putting the gun to the head, but a just
increase commensurate with the labour
involved in the task of collecting the leaf,
even if --- as often as not --- it was achieved
by putting a gun to the contractor's
head rather than any agitation by the
leaf-pickers. In any case this has boosted
the disposable income in the hands of tribals
substantially and has been the singlemost
important economic benefit the _adivasis_
have got from the presence and the
organisation of the _Naxalites_. If nobody
in the relief camps or the villages of
Dantewada told the _NHRC_'s fact finding
team of this, then it must be concluded
that nobody was willing or in a position
to tell the truth.

It is true that in addition to higher wage
rate for picking the leaf the _Naxalites_ also
demanded and took "party fund" from the
contractors, and that in the last couple of
years before the rise of the _Salwa Judum_
the _tendu patta_ contractors withdrew
from the business over considerable areas
to counter the pressure put upon them by
the _Naxalites_. It is also true that in the
year 2005 the government of Chhattisgarh
decided to dispense with the contractor in
the _tendu patta_ business and replace him
by cooperative societies of the tribals
themselves, against which the _Naxalites_
gave a call for strike, asking the _adivasis_
to stop picking the leaf. This could well
have led to some "indignation" such as
that referred to by the _NHRC_'s report. But
this way of putting it would give a very
different picture than that conveyed by
the report.

The origin of the _Salwa Judum_ is explained
in terms that the Chhattisgarh
government has been propagating most
vigorously. It is located in the gathering of
_adivasi_ people in the village of Karkeli
(wrongly spelled as Kankeli) in Bijapur
district in the summer of 2005 pursuant to
the arrest of the village youth in the aftermath
of the blowing up of the _Central Reserve
Police Force_ vehicle by the _Maoists_
on 5 May. It is said that the people expressed
resentment at such armed actions
which bring repression upon their heads
and constitute a grave threat to the life
and liberty of able-bodied youth. This incident
should be regarded as beyond controversy
since a _Maoist_-inspired publication
also speaks of the resentment.
Though the said publication does not say
so, this seems to have been followed by
meetings of tribal people at some villages
nearby, such as Tadmendri, Usikapatnam,
Ambeli, etc. The issue of harassment faced
by the _adivasi_ people at the hands of the
police, who claimed to be pursuing
_Maoists_, was discussed by these gatherings
and it appears that many blamed the
_Maoists_ for giving an opportunity to the
police by their unilateral acts of violence.

# Growth of _Salwa Judum_

But the _Salwa Judum_ did not grow by
itself by a multiplication of such meetings.
It grew only after Mahendra Karma, a
corrupt and over-bearing tribal leader of
the Congress Party, who has an ancient
grouse against the _Maoists_ and is a veteran
of two _Jan Jagran Abhiyans_, entered the
picture to create a "movement" out of these
instances of resentment. And from his entry
onwards, it is better described as a
lynch-mob than as a movement. The mob
raided villages, forced the people to join it
on pain of death or burning of their dwellings,
and forced the most new recruits to
compromise themselves by committing
murder or arson in the next village against
_adivasi_ people just such as themselves.

There is no doubt that at all times the
_Salwa Judum_ has consisted of some
people who have a real grouse against
the _Maoists_, for which the _Maoists_ have
certainly given cause, but it has swelled its
numbers by such methods. And its main
task has been to clear the villages, first of
_Maoist_ sympathisers and then of all the
people, so that the terrain would be free
for the security forces to hunt and flush
out the _Maoists_. This is a very conscious
decision taken by Mahendra Karma and
aided by the administration which set up
or allowed the setting up of the camps
which came up as a rash all over the south
and south-west of the then undivided
district of Dantewada. The members of
the _NHRC_ team, all of them experienced
police officers, surely cannot pretend
ignorance of this tried and tested method
of counter-insurgency, which has been
followed by many a state, including our
own in Mizoram? They do know, and
therefore strenuously avoid any interpretation
of the _Salwa Judum_ that would
even remotely suggest such parallels. It is
depicted instead as an _adivasi_ people's
protest movement against _Naxalite_ oppression,
"an outburst of the pent-up
feelings of the tribals who suffered for
long at the hands of the _Naxalites_", "the
peaceful movement by the villagers
against the _Naxalites_" which was "bloodied
by _Naxalite_ attacks".

The lengthy chapter titled "Findings"
sets out the results of the investigation
done by the _NHRC_ team into individual
allegations contained in the writ petitions,
and those received from the people during
the team's visit. A first reading gives the
impression that many of the allegations
made by the petitioners before the Supreme
Court are unfounded. But a more careful
reading tells a more complex story. In some
cases the local people of the concerned
village are reported to have said to the
_NHRC_ team that the facts underlying the
allegation are not true, and therefore a
conclusion is recorded that it is false. In
other cases the report says that the village
concerned is deserted or burnt down or
that the local people have expressed
ignorance of the matter, or that they have
said that the whereabouts of the persons
alleged to have been killed are not known.
In such cases the conclusion drawn is that
the allegation is "not substantiated".

To take just one instance, paragraphs
6.46, 6.46.1 and 6.46.2 deal with the allegation
of the petitioners that one Dallu
Raut of Markapal was killed by the _Salwa
Judum_ or security forces. The _NHRC_ team
interacts with the villagers from Markapal
at the Bairamgarh camp, and it is confirmed
that Dallu Raut indeed died. But
while they say it was the _Naxalites_ who
killed him, in "cross-questioning some of
them stated that he had been killed by the
Naga battalion". The report adds that
there is no police record at all of his killing,
and concludes that in the result "the
allegation that Dallu Raut was killed by
the _Salwa Judum_ or security forces could
not be substantiated".

# Responsibilities of an Investigation

But who is to substantiate it? Investigation
-- since investigation is what the _NHRC_
team has set out to do -- is not an adversarial
game played by the complainant and
the investigator, where the investigator
challenges the complainant to prove to allegation
and triumphantly records his/her
failure in case evidence is not forthcoming.
In the trial of a criminal case in a Court,
the law as we follow in our country does
say that the complainant caries the burden
of proving the allegation, and the case will
fail if the complainant fails to do so, but no
law or legal principle says that this applies
to the investigation of an offence. It is for
the investigator to find out what happened
to the person whose whereabouts are not
known, how the deserted village got to be
deserted, and how the burnt village got to
be burnt down, etc.

The report of the _NHRC_ reveals no such
effort. They have not even enquired with
the local police as to what investigation
has been done about the burnt remains of
a village. Or whether they know anything
at all about the whereabouts of the missing
persons. Or who in their opinion as
investigators caused the killing of a dead
body found in the villages or the jungle.
Without so much as talking to the salaried
investigators of offences appointed by the
State of Chhattisgarh, how did they record
that a complaint could not be verified or
substantiated? If the team found no time
to pursue their investigation beyond talking
to the people found in the village concerned,
if such village is still habitable
and habited, it should have recorded that
it is in no position to draw any conclusion.
It cannot conclude that the complaint
is "unsubstantiated" or not verifiable. The
fact that having dismissed most of the
allegations in such manner, the report at
the end adds that cases of missing persons
must be investigated, does not set right
the totally misleading impression that the
"findings" give.

In some cases, where the allegation is
that a person has been killed by the _Salwa
Judum_, the report finds that the person
has died in an "encounter" and declares
that the allegation is false. Indeed, in the
conclusion it is specifically stated that
many of the persons listed by the petitioners
as victims of the _Salwa Judum_ are
"_Naxalites_ killed in encounters with the
security forces". It is found "significant"
that many of the names listed by the
petitioners as victims of the State/_Salwa
Judum_ violence are found in a list of
martyrs published by the _Maoists_ which
was recovered in a police raid. It is not
clear what is significant about that. Why
should not a victim of _Salwa Judum_ violence
be regarded as a martyr by the
_Naxalites_? What difference does it make
to the complaint if such a victim turns out
to have been an activist of some _Maoist_
forum such as the _Dandakaranya Adivasi
Kisan Mazdoor Sanghatana_?

# _Salwa Judum_ and Armed Forces

Equally importantly, the opinion that
someone officially declared to have been
killed in action by the security forces
should not be described as a victim of
_Salwa Judum_ violence begs the question
central to the whole case: has any distinction
ever been maintained in Dantewada
between the _Salwa Judum_ and the police/
armed forces? The _NHRC_ team does not
answer the question with evidence, but
pleads very strenuously in favour of such a
distinction. It is said at more than one
point that the _Salwa Judum_ should not be
confused with the police or armed forces
operating in the area, even with the _Special
Police Officers_ (_SPOs_) who have in fact been
picked from out of the most active participants
of the _Salwa Judum_ "movement".
This is where the report reads like a partisan
statement of the case and not an impartial
fact finding. In fact, the dominant tone and
tenor of the report is to protect the _Salwa
Judum_ and its image from being tarnished
by allegations of crime. Even where it becomes
necessary to admit that the _Salwa
Judum_ has committed some offences, it is
hedged by a hurried caveat that the _Naxalites_
did worse. Where it becomes necessary
to recognise that the police have not
registered any offence against the _Salwa
Judum_ it is again quickly added that even
before the _Salwa Judum_ entered the scene,
many crimes committed by the _Naxalites_
would go unreported because the people
were afraid to complain. This certainly
does not answer the complaint, because
the police never desisted from registering
a crime in the context of _Naxalite_ offences
of which they had information for the
reason that no one gave a complaint. In
the case of _Salwa Judum_ even murder
and arson in public within the sight of
the police have gone unrecorded.

# Tactic of Counter-insurgency

But to be fair to the _NHRC_ team, they are
not partial to this particular creation of
Mahendra Karma but to the principle
underlying it: a valuable tactic of counter-insurgency
in the eyes of the police, which
should not be delegitimised even if it
means overlooking evident instances of
violation of the canons of the _rule of law_.
Even such a routine experience which
every visitor has had, namely, the stopping
and checking of vehicles and collection
of a toll by the _Salwa Judum_, is not
acknowledged. That is also said to be "not
substantiated". Well, one can only say that
if the _NHRC_ team had gone around without
police escort, they themselves would
have been stopped and checked, which is
the best type of substantiation. And if
they had gone around in a vehicle with an
Andhra Pradesh registration, as many
were constrained to, they would have experienced
a trepidation that would have
ruled out the conclusion that this is no
different from the joyous collection of
money at festival times, said to have been
"traditionally done by tribals in Bastar
since many years". (Do not even non-tribal
villagers indulge in such innocent if
irritating pastimes in other states? And
have the police not distinguished this
from extortion?)

One fact must have struck the _NHRC_
team, who are trained investigators, one
presumes. Where the allegation of an
atrocity is refuted categorically by the people
in the Dantewada villages they visited,
it is on the basis of clear statements, right
or wrong. Where its truth is a possibility,
the information given by the villagers is
vague and uncertain. And the specific
information given by displaced people
whom the team met across the border in
Andhra Pradesh turns out to be more solid
than the petitioners' allegations.

A very clear request was made to the
_NHRC_ before its team set out to do the
enquiry, that public hearings be held in
Eturnagaram and Bhadrachalam, the
scheduled area headquarters of Warangal
and Khammam districts of Andhra Pradesh,
respectively, after giving public notice.
The reason is that the severest victims of
_Salwa Judum_ have run away to these two
districts and there is greater likelihood of
the team getting frank views and candid
information here than within the sight
and hearing of the _Salwa Judum_ across
the border. For, those who are left behind
in the villages of Dantewada are those who
are with the _Salwa Judum_ or those who
have decided to live with the _Salwa Judum_.
This, by the way, may well account for a
part though not all of the negative views
heard by the _NHRC_ team in the villages of
Dantewada. There was no response to this
request from the _NHRC_.

However, while a sub-team of the _NHRC_
team visited a few villages in Andhra
Pradesh without public intimation, a public
hearing was held in Cherla in Khammam
district, which is away from the area of
the largest concentration of displaced
people's settlements in the district, and is
inaccessible to those in Warangal. In that
hearing the statements of a few of the displaced
persons were recorded. The _NHRC_
team may not have realised it, but the
people who came before them at Cherla
are Telugu-speaking tribes from across
the border who are not among the worst
victims of the _Salwa Judum_. The worst
victims are the tribal community described
as _Muria_ in Chhattisgarh and
_Gotti Koya_ or _Gutti Koya_ in Andhra
Pradesh. A systematic gathering of their
stories would have counter-balanced the
views heard in the camps and the villages
of Dantewada.

The team had the opportunity of hearing
only one batch of them, in the sitting
held at Dantewada on 10 June 2008.
People from Nendra who were driven into
Andhra Pradesh by the _Salwa Judum_ gave
their testimonies, but the report treats
their statements with scepticism. This
need not surprise any one because even
the reluctance of the displaced persons
living in wretched conditions in Andhra
Pradesh to return to Chhattisgarh is found
"intriguing" because the _NHRC_ team believes
that the _Salwa Judum_ "is no longer
its original self" (which seems to contradict
the view expressed elsewhere in the
report that the _Salwa Judum_ was always
a benign people's movement). Though
continued "apprehensions" regarding _Salwa
Judum_ are not ruled out as a reason, that
obviously does not account for the intriguing
character of the reluctance. The
real motive is suspected to be that the
_Naxalites_ do not want them to go back and
be won over by the State and the _Salwa
Judum_. Predetermined conclusions could
go no farther.
