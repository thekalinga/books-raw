The eighth state conference of the _Andhra
Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee(APCLC)_
was held at Kurnool on December 11, 12 and
13, 1993. The occasion marked the 20th
anniversary of the formation of the
organisation.

The conference bid farewell in gratitude
to K G Kannabiran who ceased to be president
of the organisation after a 15-year stint
as its head. The period 1978 to 1993, during
which Kannabiran was president, was a
period of growth, repression, expansion and
sacrifice for _APCLC_. The conference elected
MT Khan --- journalist and writer --- in his stead
as the new president.

To reflect the range of civil rights concerns
to which _APCLC_ has over the years
extended its activity, the conference formally
amended the organisation's manifesto.
The amendments are to the effect that

* we consider it necessary to fight caste and
  patriarchy as sources of civil rights violation, in addition to the state machinery and
  private property;

* we consider it necessary to fight for democratic
values in politics and society, such as
for instance secularism and protection of
minorities' rights;

* we will actively criticise the state's economic and other policies from the point of
  view of democratic rights, values and principles; in particular from the point of view
  of social, political and economic justice;
  accountability of the government to people's
  aspirations; concurrence of government
  policies with the constitutional _directive
  principles_, etc.

The conference also approved resolutions
to the effect that, with the aim of
democratising the organisation's structure
and broadening its outlook, special effort
will be made to induct cadre from a broad
democratic stream irrespective of specific
political ideology; and also to develop cadre
and leadership from _scheduled castes_, tribes,
backward castes, women, minorities and
other underprivileged sections of society.

The conference also approved a resolution
welcoming the resolution passed at the
recent annual conference of the _Organisation
for Protection of Democratic Rights (OPDR)_
that the _OPDR_ would strive for
organisational unity of the civil-rights movement
in Andhra Pradesh. The conference
resolved to work more closely with _OPDR_
and strive for unity.
