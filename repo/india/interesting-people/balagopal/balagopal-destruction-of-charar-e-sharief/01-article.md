We share the grief of the Kashmiri people at
the wanton destruction of the 15th century
shrine of _Sheikh Noor-ud-din Noorani_,
known popularly as _Chrar-e-Sharief_. While
armed militants desecrated the sanctity of
the shrine by taking shelter there, it still does
not absolve, the Government of India of its
primary responsibility to protect the shrine.

There was no pressing need to free the
shrine of the 45--50 militants who in any case
did not pose a challenge to the might of the
Indian state. What is more by denying access
to Kashmiri leaders and journalists the
government jeopardised its own claims. In
the wake of the destruction, no Kashmiri is
willing to accept the government's version. As
a result --- hardliners on both sides --- in Kashmir
and rest of the country, have gained the upper
hand. Possibilities of a politically negotiated
solution have receded. And after six years of
repression the people of Kashmir are once
again confronted with escalation of violence.
