_A cycle of violence and counter-violence is devastating the lives
of adivasis in Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh, a Maoist
"_liberated area_". There is no official record of the number of
persons killed as a result of the brutal violence of the _Salwa Judum_.
While the Maoists had put an end to the severe harassment of the
adivasis by forest and police officials, successfully resisted
domination and oppression of the adivasis by the patel-patwari,
and raised the rate for picking the tendu leaf, there are certain
conflicts of interest in the present context of a counter-insurgency
that have created a divide within the tribal community, which
makes the present atmosphere tense._

\ 

A number of strategies of counter-insurgency
have been used by the
establishment in India, each of
them more obnoxious than the next. One
would perhaps be reading too much of a
method into these acts if one were to contend
that a certain unified entity called "the state"
is with experimental intent trying out one
strategy after another. Certainly, what is
happening in Chhattisgarh is in all probability
a local stratagem spun out of the
immediate situation, which has at its focus
a very angry and uncontrollable man called
Madavi Masa, better known as Mahendra
Karma, MLA of Dantewada. But all the
strategies add up to a matrix of brutality,
the victims of whose viciousness are the
most marginal people of the country.

The direct brute force of the armed forces
was tried out in the border areas --- Nagaland,
Mizoram, Kashmir --- since the desire to
secede from India evokes such hatred in
the mainland that few would care to speak
out against the employment of inhuman
force against it. The same cannot be said
of every insurgency in the country.
_Naxalism_, certainly, meets with perhaps
the least unsympathetic reaction of all
insurgencies from society because of its
contribution to protecting the poor, especially
the _adivasis_ and _dalits_, from exploitation
and oppression. Quite strange people
profess respect for the _Naxalites_ on this score.
Hence direct force, while it has certainly
been used extensively in states such as
Andhra Pradesh, would not be acceptable
beyond a point if used against the _Naxalites_.
A brutally rational alternative is the
encouragement of private vengeance
against it. The _Senas_ of Bihar have come
in handy in that state. Support to bands of
vengeful ex-_Naxalites_ is being tried out in
Andhra Pradesh. And the _Salwa Judum_
--- a cruel joke of a peace movement --- in
Chhattisgarh. A point that the _Naxalites_
may (or may not) like to note is that each
such strategy succeeds only because of some
fault or faults of theirs. If they had taken
conscious steps to break the caste mould of
politics in Bihar, mobilisation of opposition
to them in the form of caste _Senas_ would
have certainly been less easy. If they had
learnt to distinguish mere rowdyism from
radical militancy in the recruitment of cadre,
and been more open, transparent and merciful
in imposing punishment upon "informers"
and "renegades", the vengeful gangs
that are targeting their friends in Andhra
Pradesh would have been less populous. As
for _Salwa Judum_, it is arguable that the
_Maoists_' non-chalant exercise of power in
their "_liberated areas_", unmindful of whose
interests and whose rights they are trampling
on and how unthinkingly, has opened
a chink in their otherwise unbreachable
armour that their enemies are using with
a callous want of hesitation.

# Dantewada --- A _Maoist_ '_Liberated Area_'

That the violence and counter-violence
that is fast devastating the lives of _adivasis_
on a large scale in Dantewada district of
Chhattisgarh is taking place in a _Maoist_
"_liberated area_" is a fact that needs to be
kept in mind in understanding what is
happening there. That fact justifies nothing
of what the Chhattisgarh administration
is doing there, but then nothing justifies
the tendency in democratic circles to
talk as if all that is relevant for understanding
the role of the _Maoists_ in the area is
the poverty and general backwardness of
the tribes living there. It is good and
necessary to insist that _Maoism_ shall not
be treated as a mere problem of crime and
disorder but should be seen as a socioeconomic
issue. It is fine that one hears
more and more persons say this these
days, even if that means little in practice.
But nothing is gained by ignoring the fact
that _Maoism_ is not some social reform
movement that uses guns for greater effect,
but a political movement aimed at smashing
the existing state and building an alternative
state, not at one go but by proceeding
from remote and neglected rural
areas to the more developed rural areas,
and the urban areas finally. A _liberated
zone_ is an area where an incipient state of
the future has been or is declared to have
been established, forcing out the existing
state. One is free to like this or dislike this,
wholly or conditionally, but one cannot
ignore this is analysing the _Maoist_ movement
and the reactions to it such as the
_Salwa Judum_ phenomenon.

It would be idle to pretend that any state
would with equanimity tolerate the proclamation
of "_liberated areas_" within its
territory from where its authority is pushed
out by force. It is very doubtful that the
_Maoists_ themselves would behave more
tolerantly in a similar situation. This is not
because sovereignty is some unbreachable
quality but because it has guns in its defence.
But there are many points that the establishment
in Chhattisgarh would need to
ponder before it draws from the very notion
of its territorial sovereignty the conclusion
that the support that it is illegitimately
extending to the brutal gang called _Salwa
Judum_ is legitimate. One, these areas were
outside the ken of its administrative, let
alone developmental, lens for decades
before the _Maoists_ declared them _liberated
areas_. The district collector of Dantewada,
a mild and pleasant-mannered officer of
tribal origin, concedes that much. If sovereignty,
like property, provided for a
prescriptive right, the _Maoists_ can certainly
claim the right to sovereignty in
Dantewada by prescription since they took
over an area practically unoccupied by the
Indian state. More seriously, given this
fact, the Chhattisgarh government should in
all humility be less righteous in its response
to the _Maoists_. Two, and this is the
more difficult point to drive into the heads
of sovereigns, however inviolate territorial
sovereignty may appear, if you gave guns
in your hands to defend it, when a political
challenge to it arises from a political force
having substantial base among the people,
especially the poor or otherwise disadvantaged
sections of the people, it calls for a
political handling of the issue and not
suppression by brute force.

But brute force is what the government
of Chhattisgarh is deploying. The idea is
plainly that the jungles will be cleared of
all habitations, and the inhabitants driven
to camps located in patrollable areas, which
will later be replaced by colonies. By this
means the _Maoists_ will be cut off from
their popular support and deprived of food
and shelter. Thus isolated they will be
forced to surrender, leave the area, or else
engage with the paramilitary in suicidal
battles. The chief minister has openly
declared that "those in the camps are with
the government and those in the forests are
with the _Maoists_". Officially, there are
54,768 people now in 17 camps located
on accessible black-top roads spread
over Konta, Geedam, Bairamgarh, Bijapur
and Usoor blocks, and residential colonies
are being built apace to replace these
camps. A visitor cannot avoid the suspicion
that this figure is exaggerated, whether for
the purpose of propaganda or the more
mundane purpose of pocketing the money
sanctioned for feeding the refugees, but
there is little doubt that the highways of
south Bastar are teeming with refugees
from the interior of the jungles.

# Brutal Violence of _Salwa Judum_

The odd thing about these refugees is
that the majority of them did not come to
the camps because they were driven away
from their habitations, but rather they left
their habitations because they were driven
into these camps. The means by which this
has been achieved is the brutal violence
of the _Salwa Judum_. Mobs of the _Salwa
Judum_ have gone on rampage with the
paramilitary in tow forcing villagers
to come out and join the camps. Recalcitrant
villages are attacked by mobilising
pliant villages. Any one who does not join
these attacks is beaten/fined. In the area
surrounding Mahendra Karma's native
village of Pharsapal in Dantewada block,
the prevailing rule is that any one who does
not join the rampaging mobs of _Salwa
Judum_ has to pay a fine of Rs 700 and
receive seven lashes (It was not possible
to find out the significance of the digit 7).
In these mobilised attacks on reluctant
villages, large-scale arson is perpetrated.
Upwards of a hundred houses each have
been burnt in many such villages. Not only
the house but all the grain, clothes, and all
the household goods are also consigned to
fire. The cattle, goats and poultry are taken
away. And identified supporters of the
_Maoists_, if they have not already escaped,
are killed.

These killings are not even recorded. In
law, every suspicious death, and that includes
every death by bullets, is to be
followed by inquest and post-mortem
examination. But in Dantewada it is officially
acknowledged that after opening fire
upon the _Maoists_ and/or the people with
them, the armed forces and the _Salwa Judum_
gang accompanying them turn back and
come away. They neither wait to confirm
the death or survival of the persons hit, nor
do they bring them for treatment if alive,
or inquest if dead. Hence, strangely, there is
no record of the dead on the other side in
this war the Chhattisgarh government is
fighting against the _Maoists_. One only
needs to add that this does not happen so
routinely even in Kashmir where the argument
that the militancy is Pakistan's proxy
war is readily available as an excuse for not
giving the dead bodies a civil treatment.

The consequence is that while there is
a precise count of the number killed by the
_Maoists_ from June 2005 (when the _Salwa
Judum_ started) till mid-May 2006, namely,
12 _Special Police Officers_ (_SPOs_) 25 paramilitary
personnel and 191 civilians (almost
all of them _adivasis_), there is no count
of how many of the _Maoists_ and their
supporters have been killed. (There is a
suspicion that some persons killed by _Salwa
Judum_ have been shown as victims of
_Maoist_ violence, but that number is unlikely
to be very large.) Until June 2005,
there is little doubt that it was the _Maoists_
who killed more, for the police in Bastar
had never developed the habit of encounter
killing to anything near the same extent as
their southern brothers of Andhra Pradesh.
But after the creation of _Salwa Judum_ the
situation is not the same. There have been
innumerable instances reported in _Maoist_
publications of gruesome murders committed
by the _Salwa Judum_-paramilitary
combine, and there is little reason to dismiss
it as propaganda. But it is difficult
to arrive at a precise estimate.

What is relevant is that except the
handful of paramilitary personnel and
perhaps a few _Maoists_ of Andhra Pradesh
origin killed in the conflict, all the dead
in the last one year's violence are local
_adivasis_. The number is in all probability
close to 400. It is they who have been
killed, it is their houses in their hundreds
that have been burnt down, it is they who
have gathered in the camps, whether
dragged there by the _Salwa Judum_ or driven
by fear of the _Maoists_. Of course, most of
the participants in the _Salwa Judum_ are
local _adivasis_ too, and it is they who burnt
down the houses of fellow _adivasis_ and
have participated in killing them. If the
_adivasis_ had themselves voluntarily created
the _Salwa Judum_, then one would have
perhaps merely rued the demise of _adivasi_
innocence and bracketed out the very notion
of a unitary entity called "_adivasi_" insofar
as Chhattisgarh is concerned. But it was
not they who created it to fight the _Maoists_.
The dissatisfaction, unhappiness, dislike
of the _Maoists_ among a section of the
_adivasis_ at various levels (not necessarily
all exploiters or wicked men as the _Maoists_
would want us to believe) was taken
advantage of by political interests who
drove them into a frenzy and created a
criminal gang for their own purposes.
Excepting Mahendra Karma himself, all
the rest of the vocal leaders of _Salwa Judum_
are non-tribals. And Mahendra Karma is
always surrounded by non-tribals who are
plainly from the Hindi heartland of north
India. Moreover, all those who have visited
Chhattisgarh in recent months and
interacted with the _Salwa Judum_ at the
camps must have observed that it is where
the leaders are non-tribals --- of Andhra
origin in Konta, and from UP and Bihar
in Bairamgarh, Jangla and Bijapur --- that
their conduct is uncouth and offensive.
The reason probably has something to do
with the generally expansive nature of
people who live in and among the plenitude
of nature, but there is a more concrete reason
too. The _adivasis_ who are angry with the
_Maoists_ are those who have suffered personal
injury caused to them, whether with
or without justification. It is different with
the Andhra or Bihari settlers who are the
vocal spokesmen of the _Salwa Judum_. Some
of them may have suffered some personal
injury but in the main their enmity is more
political-ideological. The very marked tone
of _Sangh parivar_ ideology cannot be missed
in their _anti-Maoist_ rhetoric.

# Conflicts of Interest

It is this altogether unhappy plight of the
_adivasis_ that is most worrisome. The tragedy
is that this is happening in a state
created in the name of _adivasis_, and in a
"_liberated area_" constituted by the _Maoists_
primarily with the support of _adivasis_. If
the state of Chhattisgarh has continued to
be as indifferent to the _adivasis_ as the
previous state of Madhya Pradesh, the
_Maoists_ appear to have taken their social
base too much for granted. In the initial
days of their entry into the region, as in the
contiguous parts of Andhra Pradesh, they
had put an end to the severe harassment
the _adivasis_ suffered at the hands of forest
and police officials for cultivating land in
the reserve forests, and to the oppressive
_patel-patwari_ dominance. The rate for
picking _tendu leaf_ was substantially
increased. Indeed, the main reasons for
the wide popularity of the _Naxalites_ in
the entire forest region abutting the
Godavari river in Telangana, Vidarbha and
Chhattisgarh, is the protection they gave
to the forest-dwellers for cultivation in
reserve forests, the substantial increase
they achieved in the payment for picking
_tendu leaf_, and the end they put to the
oppressive domination of the headmen and
_patwaris_. The income from _tendu leaf_
picking has in particular played a significant
role in tribal life ever since. They
would have been at a terrible disadvantage
in negotiating the monetised economy they
are surrounded by if they did not have this
income. Which also explains why a strike
of _tendu leaf_ picking dictated by the _Maoists_
with the best of intentions could make the
_adivasis_ unhappy, a point relevant for the
present crisis.

But it will not do to stop the story here
and depict all the people opposing the
_Maoists_ as vested interests hurt by this
widely appreciated activity of the _Maoists_.
The _Maoists_ have gone ahead from there
towards their goal of state power by declaring
the areas of their influence as
_guerrilla zones_, and in the case of Dantewada
forests, a _liberated zone_ as well.
Thereafter the need to establish and secure
their authority, protect their armed squads
from the police and the paramilitary, secure
the obedience of the people living in
the area to the _sanghams_ set up by them,
etc., become matters of predominant concern.
This can alienate people who cannot
all be characterised as _exploiters_. An elected
sarpanch who is told that he cannot run
the _gram panchayat_ because the affairs of
the village will be run by the _sangham_ of
the _Maoists_ may well be unhappy, and if
he is beaten up for being unhappy he may
well become an enemy of the _Maoists_. Yet
for merely this reason he cannot be called
an exploiter or oppressor. If in bringing
social life in the area under the decisionmaking
institutions devised by the _Maoists_,
the traditional community structure of
the _adivasis_ is ruptured, then notwithstanding
some regressive elements of the
tradition that are better rid of, the people
may in fact lose rather than gain because
there is no guarantee that the strength the
community has traditionally given the
tribe to face external incursions will be
replicated by the _Maoist_ institutions. And
all people who are unhappy with this
cannot be condemned as traditional
elders who have lost their authority, or
their henchmen.

If in forcing the state out of the _liberated
area_, employment creating works such
as the laying of roads taken up by the state
is banned, people hoping for some
remunerative employment are bound to be
upset. Indeed this is a frequent complaint
heard in Dantewada, and the _Maoists_'
answer that roads only bring exploiters
into the tribal area, or that the state which
was never interested in laying roads in the
area for 50 years is suddenly interested
now not for the sake of the people but only
to make the forests accessible to the para-military
to hunt down the _Naxalites_, can
only sound specious to the ears of the
people who have lost the employment
opportunity. What is really happening is
that the interests of the people and the
_Maoists_' political agendas start diverging
from the day they declare an area a _guerrilla
zone_, and more so, a _liberated zone_,
a fact that should be obvious if one has
not imported into reality the _Maoist_ theory
that the revolutionary movement as conducted
by them is in the _highest interest
of the people_.

Their conduct in blasting school buildings
is a stark case in point. In their literature
they have sought to explain this
saying that the government had closed
down the schools to house the paramilitary
forces in the buildings and that is why they
blew them up. But in fact no school was
closed for the purpose. School buildings
are occupied fully by the forces now
because the schools are closed for vacation.
Otherwise the forces would stop at
school buildings to take rest. Bringing
armed personnel into school premises can
certainly be objected to but blowing up
schools for that reason is an inexcusable
conduct, more particularly in an area with
poor educational levels. The _tehsildar_ of
Konta, who frankly describes the _Salwa
Judum_ activists milling around his office
as criminals, says the _Maoists_ have blown
up 31 out of the 400 school buildings in
his _tehsil_. There appears to be no reason
to disbelieve him. There are no other
insurgents in the country who have done
this excepting the pan-Islamists of Kashmir
who have no respect for the education
imparted by a non-theocratic state. Coupled
with the tendency to hunt for informers and
kill them, these and similar conflicts of
interest have always contained the possibility
of popular disaffection with the
_Maoists_. As far back as 1991--92 the
_Communist Party of India (CPI)_ led a _Jan
Jagaran Abhiyan_ against the _Maoists_ but
that was put down by the _Maoists_ by killing
about a dozen _CPI_ leaders. The _CPI_ is said
to have later criticised itself for having
kept the company of men like Mahendra
Karma in running the _Abhiyan_. Or maybe
it was the ritual self-criticism required to
placate the _Maoists_ and stop them from
killing more of their leaders. But last year,
following a poor harvest the previous
year, there were gatherings of people in
areas of _Maoist_ influence in Bijapur
police district of Dantewada to discuss the
problems arising from the _Maoists_' ban on
employment generating public works
undertaken by the government, and the
strike of _tendu leaf_ picking dictated by the
_Maoists_ to force increase in the payment.
Mahendra Karma an _ex-CPI_ man who
subsequently joined the Congress and
made a lot of money, came to know of
this and jumped into the fray and took
over the dissatisfaction to fashion the
_Salwa Judum_.

# Tense Atmosphere

About a year on, he is a very tense man.
He is aware that he cannot call back the
"movement", he cannot get off the _tiger_
he has created. The moment that happens,
the lives of the _Salwa Judum_ leaders,
including his own, will be at terminal risk,
for forgiveness is not a virtue highly prized
by the _Maoists_, and the death penalty is
perhaps the most frequent punishment in
their penal code. The lesser _Salwa Judum_
leaders in the camps say that the fight will
go on till the _Maoists_ are wiped out, and
they can safely go back to their villages,
but Karma knows this is a pipe dream. In
the meanwhile life of the voluntary as well
as reluctant denizens of the camps ruled
by the _Salwa Judum_ is miserable, for the
camps are little better than cattle sheds.
Those villagers who have not joined the
camps but run deep into the forests to live
under _Maoist_ protection are by all accounts
leading even worse lives for the
camp dwellers at least have food provided
by the government. There is a third class
who decided to go neither with the _Salwa
Judum_ nor the _Maoists_. They have crossed
Chhattisgarh's notional border with Andhra
Pradesh and are scattered all over the
forests of Khammam district, living on the
generosity of their fellow-tribes people
over there. Fortunately, the forests on
either side are populated by the same tribe ---
the _Koyas_.

This misery is compounded by fear of
death. The paramilitary force described as
the "_Naga battalion_" is known for the brutal
treatment of the _Maoists_ or their
sympathisers it is in search of, and the
residents of the 17 roadside camps are
sitting ducks for the _Maoists_. Three recent
incidents, all from Konta _taluka_, attest to
the insecurity of the opponents of the
_Maoists_ living in the camps. The first
happened on February 28 when the _Maoists_
detonated a landmine at Darbhaguda and
killed 26 persons returning from a _Salwa
Judum_ meeting at Dornapal. It is generally
believed that those who did not die in the
blast had their throats slit. Again, on
April 29, 15 men staying at the Dornapal
camp were killed by the _Maoists_. About
36 residents of the camp, all of them
originally from the village of Manikonta
had gone to their village to fetch their
belongings. They were abducted by the
_Maoists_, the old and the children among
them let off, and the able-bodied massacred.
The most recent incident happened
in the early hours of May 13 when a big
group led by the _Maoists_ --- their number
variously given in the Hindi press as 150
and 300, and in the Telugu press as 1,000
--- attacked the roadside refugee camp at
Injaram on the NH 221 and killed three
_SPOs_ and one _Salwa Judum_ member. Such
attacks can happen any time. On the other
side, the government of Chhattisgarh has
appointed 5,000 _Salwa Judum_ members as
_SPOs_ and is training them in the use of
rifles. They are a potent life threat to the
_Maoist_ sympathisers if any of them ever
venture near their deserted habitations.
Their very appointment is in fact a gross
abuse of authority since the provisions of
the _Police Act_ that permit the appointment
of _SPOs_ was never intended to arm one
social group to exterminate another.

Small wonder then that a very tense
atmosphere prevails in south Bastar today,
especially Konta _taluka_. With the rains,
things are likely to become worse. For one
thing, the camps will be even more unlivable.
Secondly, the inmates of the camps
as well as those sheltering in the forests
are likely to be tempted to sneak back and
till their lands. This can endanger their
lives. Thirdly, as time progresses the bitterness
of the divide among the tribes is likely
to become worse, to the detriment of all.
But who in Chhattisgarh cares?
