Sumanta Banerjee (_Where Are the Workers of Yesteryear ... ?, Economic Political Weekly, Issues --- December 17
and 24--31, 1983_) is bold as usual, but
he appears to be in search of the wrong
object. Alienation can produce rebels,
but not revolutionaries. A rebel merely
destroys, but a revolutionary
destroys _and_ creates, i.e., he transforms.
If Marx were in search of destroyers
he would have certainly found them
in the 'social scum'. It was because
he searched for revolutionaries that he
identified the _proletariat_ as the agent
of social change. It is no rhetorical
oversight that the Communist Manifesto
describes the _lumpen proletariat_
as both a 'dangerous class' and a 'passively
rotting mass'.

As Sumanta Banerjee no do ubt recognises,
for Marx the centrality of the
_proletariat_ lay not merely in that its
very conditions of existence made it
an organised and disciplined force.
That is just one side, and the lesser
side of the matter. The more important
side is that of all the classes in
Capitalist society, it is only the _proletariat_
whose class position and interest
was supposed by Marx to impel it
to create Socialism --- the collective
organisation and appropriation of social
production on the basis of the most
advanced knowledge built over five
thousand years of civilisation. The
production relations can be transformed
from one variety of exploitation to
another by an exploiting class but property-less
producers alone can transform
them from _exploitation_ to _collective
appropriation_. And this transformation
can preserve the achievements
of history only if it is led by
the _industrial proletariat_, which is heir
to the premises (if not the full extent)
of the fruits of modern knowledge.

Intellectuals, to the extent that they
too are sellers of labour power, can and
do partake of this process, but here
we nerd to take account of one peculiarity
of this species, a peculiarity that
only the _Chinese Cultural Revolution_
attempted to come to grips with: it is
by and large robbed of property in the
means of production by Capitalism, but
preserves the monopoly of intellect that
was among the first consequences of
the birth of _private property_. Pauperised
of property, it preserves the
spiritual reflex. Forever lamenting the
appropriation of its knowledge by the
ruling class, it was itself born, and
continues to reproduce itself, in the
appropriation of intellect from the
labouring people. It is perhaps this
duality that makes intellectuals what
they are: carping servant's of the ruling
class and doubtful friends of the
masses. Far from being revolutionaries,
'_alienated_' intellectuals are not
even serious rebels. This is true also
of the even amorphous body
called 'students'. Sumanta Banerjee
wants us to heed hard facts. Let us
by all means do so. Any careful
observer of these sections and their
rebellions will admit that it is only in
times of serious peasant struggle, that
student movements have also been serious
and steadfast.  Metropolitan student
radicalism (born of curricular alienation)
has never survived the first visit
to the police lock-up.

It is no doubt true that under
imperialism the _proletariat_ is highly
stratified and perhaps to some extent
even atomised. _Collective action_ for the
_collective appropriation of the means
of production_ no longer appears to be
equally in the interest of all strata of
the working class. But to counterpose
the workers' apparent disinterest in
_owning the means of production_ to the
peasants' desire for land is to make
nonsense of the problem, for' in one
case we are speaking of collective
ownership and in the other case of
private ownership. Nevertheless, the
dilemma remains, and demands a
closer look.

Firstly, militancy _per se_, has no
relation to economism or stratification.
We have seen highly economist and
sectional struggles that have been
highly militant. Secondly, coming to
the rural-urban stratification, the tie-up
between 'middle caste' sections of the
peasantry and the urban working class
is no longer as primary as it used to
be. The current generation of industrial
workers, when they are not second
generation urbanites, are often from
lower caste poor and landless peasant
families. The Indian economy has
expanded sufficiently to bring about
this change. In regions of strong poor
peasant movements, these urban industrial
workers exhibit none of the economism
of the traditional unionised
workers. The workers of Singareni coal
mines in Karimnagar and Adilabad
districts, most of whom are emigrants
from the villages of those districts and
Warangal, have turned out to be such
a headache to the State that police
camps are set up in these mines as
frequently as in the villages they come
from. The paragraph in Sumanta
Banerjee's article about 'landless labourers
who join the _industrial proletariat_'
being fatalistic and feudal is extremely
one-sided. Even in the absence of
organisation, labourers are far from
being so passive and inert. Moreover,
_struggle is not only born of a revolutionised
consciousness, it is the best
revolutioniser of consciousness_. Indeed,
Sumanta Banerjee's article is lamentably
neglectful of the crucial subjective
factor of human activity that
mediates between reality and consciousness.

Today the workers of the more
'developed' sectors of the industry are
no doubt economist and may be even a
bit elitist. But a revolutionary practice
that starts with the poor and landless
peasantry and their urban extension
can certainly create a suction that will
draw in all those who create society's
material product --- the only revolutionary
class in modern society. In
other words, in transcending Marx to
take into account the differentiation
engendered among the toilers by
imperialism, we have not yet reached
a stage, where we need to go beyond
Lenin's concept of _labour aristocracy_,
and the strategic corollary (implicit in
Lenin and quite explicit in Mao) of
the 'backward' liberating the 'forward'.
What we lack is not _revolutionary
theory_, but _revolutionary practice_. That
is the real dilemma. But the very
_alienation from practice_ involutes upon
itself and sets the dilemma on its head,
making it appear that what we lack
is _revolutionary theory_.

_The workers
of yesteryear, are very much here; the
real question is: where are the revolutionaries
of yesteryear ... ?_
