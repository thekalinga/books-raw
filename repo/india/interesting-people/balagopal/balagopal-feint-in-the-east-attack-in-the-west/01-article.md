Reading Sumanta Banerjee's brilliant
expose of _CPI(M)_[^cpim] humbug (_Economic and Political Weekly Issue: March 6_)
it struck me that Indira Gandhi has
been peculiarly well blessed by
proletarian providence with the most
convenient communist opponents
imaginable. There was a time when
she used to protest a lot to prove her
anti-imperialism, but it is noteworthy
that she no longer does so. Why
should she, when she has such helpful
enemies?

[^cpim]: Communist Party of India (Marxist).

The pro-Soviet communists are
forced to call her anti-imperialist
because she is Brezhnev's favourite,
The _CPI_[^cpi] has always said so, and the
_CPI(M)_, after some initial spluttering
has finally fallen in line --- rather
oddly, just at the time when the
Indian economy is being opened up
to imperialist capital without apology,
explanation or populist camouflage of
the kind Indira Gandhi had effectively
employed in the past. But then it is
a characteristic of vulgar Marxism
that even as it indulges in economic
determinism when that is suitable, it
is equally capable of ignoring the
economic base of politics when that
happens to be suitable.

[^cpi]: Communist Party of India (Marxist).

The pro-Deng sections of the communists
(a sizeable section of the
erstwhile Naxalites) are equally certain
that she is anti-US. Since Deng has
told them that Soviet social-imperialism
constitutes the biggest threat to
world peace, _proletarian internationalism_
calls for identifying her as the
leader of the 'pro-Soviet sections of
the ruling class' (whoever these enigmatic
gentlemen might be), who are
bent on converting India into
Soviet neo-colony; only, true to
brahminical scholasticism, they are
unable to agree on whether the country
has already attained, is on the
verge of attaining, or is about to soon
attain, that state of disgrace. If some
of us find these positions as difficult
to distinguish as _Advaita_ and _Visishtadvaita_,
that is no doubt because we
are not good enough _Vedantins_. But
they are all agreed that this makes
her anti-US --- _IMF[^imf] loan_ or _no IMF
loan_; indeed, for these peculiar Marxists,
(as for the _CPI(M)_ and _CPI_)
Indira Gandhi's stand on Kampuchea
is more important than the _IMF_ loan
and all that it implies.

[^imf]: International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international financial institution, headquartered in Washington. Its one of arms of Global Capital.

When Indira Gandhi dies (as no
doubt even anti-imperialists will) I
think the most apt epitaph for her
will be: she was anti-imperialist inspite
of herself.
