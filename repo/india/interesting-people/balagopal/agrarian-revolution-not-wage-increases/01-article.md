Gail Omvedt and Chetna Galla (July 2)
agree that what needs to be discussed is
revolutionary strategy, but they themselves
refuse to do so. The class character of the
"rural poor" is that they have an objective
interest in expropriating the rich, smashing
the existing state and social structure and
building a new society based on collective
labour and collective appropriation. This is
precisely what is _not_ the objective interest
of the most vociferous sections of the
movements for 'remunerative prices'. And
that marks a genuinely Marxist class division
of the rural people. If the rural poor
are to be described empirically then one has
to take a variety of conditions into consideration.
The class certainly includes all
of the agricultural labourers (between 25 and
30 per cent of rural families); equally certainly
it does _not_ include those _of_ the
'middle peasants' whose cultivation is
characterised by dependable irrigation and
capital infrastructure, whatever marketing
and pricing problems they may have. The
rest _of_ the peasants with self-sufficient
family holdings must be judged by these
characteristics to decide whether they can be
included in the class of the rural poor or can
be counted as neutral elements. This is not
an economic division based on income but
a _class_ division based on the existence of an
_irreconcilable_ conflict with the system.
The conflict is irreconcilable because the
developments of the last forty years have
shown that the system is incapable of
meeting the needs of the rural poor, though
it has done --- and is going to further do --- a
lot for the landlords and the better placed
peasantry, and has the capacity to further
co-opt a few more into the latter section.

We are told that the entire peasantry has
a fundamental interest in the overthrow of
capital. To put it this way, while saying that
it is revolutionary strategy that we need to
discuss, is to beg the question whether overthrow
of capital is an adequate description
of the revolution we seek. But is even this
statement true? In the first place, to lump
together the two-thirds of the rural population
"who make their living primarily
through family labour on their own fields"
as a "middle peasantry" is misleading in the
extreme. Some among them exploit substantial
amounts of the labour of others and
have a well-developed infrastructure for their
cultivation, apart from the non-agricultural
business and other interests they have. They
should properly be called rich and not
middle peasants. It will be said that all these
does not constitute a class difference, but to
see what _does_ constitute a 'class difference'
we only need to know how many among the
peasantry really have an objective interest in
a revolutionary transformation of existing
relations of property and exploitation, or
even just the overthrow of capital, and how
many have an objective interest merely in
arriving at a better arrangement of terms
with capital. That all the 'middle peasantry'
want remunerative prices is no more 'anti-capitalist'
than workers asking for higher
wages is 'anti-capitalist'. Workers become
anti-capitalist by asking for an expropriation
of capital. As a Hindi song popular in
radical circles puts it:

>When we the working masses
> 
>claim our share
>
>It will be neither a field nor a plot
> 
>but the whole world

Do all the 'middle peasants' as defined by
Gail Omvedt and Chetna Galla want _the
whole worlds_ or _only their share_?

There is a certain amount of ingenuousness
and a fair amount _of_ duplicity in the
tears that are copiously shed over the 'oppressed
peasantry'. 'Primitive accumulation
of capital' is no doubt going on world-wide,
and it does entail (among other things) unequal
exchange between agriculture and
industry, but this does not mean today the
same thing that it meant a hundred years
ago. It is no longer a one-way traffic of
buying agricultural products cheap and selling
cloth and bicycles dear. It is a two-way
traffic where capital supplies improved
inputs and technology to agriculture and
exchanges the extra produced thereby against
the inputs it has supplied, as well as consumer
goods, both of them overpriced, but
not so much as to eat up the whole of the
extra produced. The landholders are _also_
benefited roughly in proportion to their asset
holdings, though they suffer the privations
inherent to capital: anarchy of the markets,
inappropriate and ecologically disastrous
technology, importation of capital's accumulation
crisis into agriculture, etc. The
better endowed among them take these crises
in their stride and enrich themselves to a
degree without precedent, but the poorly
endowed suffer. It makes no sense to lump
all of them together. Here is a good illustration:
about 30 cultivators of cotton committed
suicide in Prakasam district of Andhra
Pradesh last year because of crop failure and
consequent indebtedness. Some observers
said the crops failed because of adulterated
pesticides, some said it was because of
drought, and Sharad Joshi --- with the admirable
single-mindedness that marks him
out as the Datta Samant of the peasantry --- insisted
during his visit that it was not crop-failure
but unremunerative prices that led
to indebtedness. Teams of journalists,
ministers, officials, newspaper editors, film
stars, and the top executives of Andhra Bank
and Syndicate Bank visited the area and
clicked tongues and shed tears. None of
them thought of laying that the wealth
generated by the very same tobacco and cotton
cultivation in the canal-irrigated tracts
of old Guntur district has produced, through
further reproduction and multiplication in
urban finance, contracts, business, real
estate, cinemas and politics, some of the
richest and most powerful people in the
state. Nor did any of these luminaries
--- including Sharad Joshi --- visit Anantapur
and Mahbubnagar districts where surely
more than 30 people have died more or less
due to starvation during the last three years
of drought. The politics of exclusive opposition
to capital is a politics of commodity
fetishism: if what you produce is not a commodity
beyond the local market --- or you do
not produce anything at all because your
lands have dried up --- then your death is not
an issue. You have to be subsumed by capital
to become a human being. Since everything
is already declared to have been subsumed
by capital, that which is not --- does not exist.
By a strange paradox, what does not interest
capital does not interest its opponents either.
And yet there are many people --- and
regions --- that are _of_ only marginal interest
to capital: people who produce for their subsistence,
or a little paddy, sesamum, _jowar_,
_bajra_, castor or groundnut for the local
market. To say that they are also interested
in remunerative prices because they also sell
something or the other is tautological.

It is not remunerative prices but land,
water and work that are the problems of the
rural poor. The agricultural labourers who
constitute between 25 and 30 per cent of the
rural population, are either landless, or if
they have land it is not enough to provide
the whole family with work to do and food
to eat. Apart from being small in size their
plots are usually poor in quality; and there
is no visible sign of improvement. For them
work and land are the major problems. As
for the self-sufficient middle peasantry,
many of them --- and almost all of them in
many areas --- do have enough land to keep
the whole family occupied when cultivation
is going on, but that is not frequently
enough or fruitful enough to give them a
decent livelihood. Irrigation --- water --- is their
main problem. Barring rich and middle
peasants in canal-irrigated areas (and in tank
or well irrigated areas, those whose landholdings
and infrastructure are good in
quality and favourably located), for the rest
of the rural working people --- land, work and
water --- are the main problems. Many of them
may --- and do --- sell a part of their produce
in the market and will certainly respond
favourably to demands for 'remunerative
prices', but that demand constitutes neither
the beginning nor the end of their worries.
In badly drought-hit Rayalaseema, for
instance, 32 per cent of the sown area is
under groundnut, and therefore any movement
for remunerative prices for that crop
will, in theory, attract attention. But apart
from the fact that no such movement has
taken root, if one talks to the cultivators
their principal wish is that the poorly utilised
waters of the Godavari should be diverted
to the Krishna and the Tungabhadra and
used to irrigate Rayalaseema, so that they
can stop growing groundnuts and grow
something they can eat. And once the water
is assured, the landless --- who do not show
much enthusiasm for land struggles today --- will
demand a share of the huge landholdings
some of the _Reddy_ landlords
possess.

And these rural poor do have an irreconcilable
conflict with the system, the kind of
irreconcilable conflict that the better-off
peasants do not have even with capital, let
alone with the system as a whole. The state
has systematically sabotaged land reforms
and has created a situation where bold
people now tell us that land reform is a
mythical dream of the urban radical; regular
and well-remunerated work is almost universally
unavailable for the poor in most part
of the country; the norm is that they work
for less than half the days in the year and
for less than the statutory minimum wage,
not to speak of a decent wage; as for water
for irrigation, hardly 40 per cent _of_ the irrigation
potential of the country has been
tapped, and the nature of property relations
in the country do not allow for efficient soil
conservation and land management, leading
to a devastation of the potential itself. This
situation, in which there is no sign of a possible
improvement, is an essential consequence
of the nature of the agrarian policy of the
Indian state. It coexists with the enrichment
of the well-endowed peasantry and of the
landlords, through the medium of agrarian
measures like electrification, irrigation,
improved seeds, machines, fertilisers,
pesticides, etc., supported infrastructurally by --- financing
and marketing institutions. The
wealth produced by these means is left untaxed
and allowed freely --- and again with
infrastructural and financial support from
the state --- to reproduce itself in contracts,
politics, trade and the tertiary sector in
general. It is from this dimension of the
state's agrarian policy the cream of the
agitators for remunerative prices are coming
forth, and we are asked by Marxists to
recognise this as the voice of the Indian
village.

But it is necessary to go beyond this and
ask whether capital is a sufficient reference
point for discussing revolutionary strategy.
And this political question turns around a
methodological question: whether capital as
a concept is adequate for understanding
Indian society and state. Most people seem
to think it is. One starts with imperialist and
Indian capital, its monopoly character, its
appetite for extended reproduction and consequent
crises, its markets, technology and
finance. Then one follows up the consequences
all this has for various social classes,
ignoring (naturally) those whose existence
is inconsequential for capital. The trouble
with this method is that it presupposes what
it triumphantly discovers at the end, and
most of its truths are tautologies, the distinction
between the two being obliterated by the
unbridled use of mathematics, that most
fetishistic of all subjects. Contrary to this
method favoured by academics, Communist
Parties have generally followed a different
method: that is to identify the principal
social classes by the mode and extent of their
property or the mode of their labour; proceed
with the presumption that propertied
classes will try to enrich themselves and to
preserve and protect their property and
power by whatever means that are historically
and socially viable, and that the working
people will equally try to protect and improve
their livelihood. The state is seen as
an agency that helps the propertied classes
to accumulate and protect their property; its
fiscal policies, its development strategies and
its _law and order_ machinery are seen as
instruments serving this end. This method
has an open mind as far as capital is concerned,
and sees it and its role for what it
is. In a situation where capital does not
merely gobble up whatever comes its way but
has the voracity to transform the whole
world 'in its image', the two methods may
lead to the same conclusion, but in the late
twentieth century post-colonial world, where
capital has no need to transform the world
to make profits for itself, it is necessary
to keep an open mind as far as capital is
concerned.

A tempting illustration is Carol Boyack
Upadhya's article on the 'Farmer-Capitalists
of Coastal Andhra', published in the July 2
and 9 issues of this journal. It is no doubt
unfair to pick on a researcher for the topic
she chooses to research; and certainly, it is
a legitimate exhibition of curiosity to desire
to know --- what happens to the surplus
generated by the canal-irrigated agriculture
of coastal Andhra. And yet, considering the
certainty that nobody is going to research
the farmer-capitalists of, say, Nellore district,
one is tempted to suspect that we are researching
whatever our methodologies allow us
to research. We have a theory which says that
capitalism in agriculture leads to accumulation
of capital, which can then be invested
in urban business to make further profits,
and which finally takes the form of industrial
capital, the whole process being
typical of the 'development of capitalism'.
But firstly, any uninitiated person living in
coastal Andhra would find it rather strange
that the researcher goes all the way to
Visakhapatnam to find out what is happening
to coastal Andhra capital, and would
realise that she does so only because she is
burdened by the faith that just as any pious
soul ultimately enters a Brahmin's body, all
capital must ultimately enter industry, and
Visakhapatnam is the only place where there
is any industry. If she were not so burdened,
the uninitiated person would tell her. She
could as well (for instance) have gone to the
Telangana districts where some of the
farmer-capitalists of coastal Andhra have
taken re-birth as liquor barons complete with
armies of _goondas_ whose job is to murder
and rape tribals and preserve their master's
liquor monopoly, some of the _goondas_ and
a few of the masters themselves getting killed
in retaliation by _naxalites_ in the process; and
since the excise revenue of the state government
equals the total expenditure on public
administration, this is not a frivolous suggestion;
or else she could have gone to
Madras to find them immersed in the production,
finance and distribution of third
rate entertainers; or she could have found
them in Vijayawada and the other coastal
Andhra towns, involved in trade, real estate
and much more shady affairs; and since the
share of trade, hotels and restaurants in the
state's net domestic product has been consistently
higher than that of manufacture,
this is not a frivolous suggestion either.

Secondly, this obsession with capital
leaves us with no 'model' to studying the
'Marnier[^marnier]-capitalists' of any either than a few
regions like coastal Andhra. In today's
Andhra Pradesh, for instance, within
the class of really rich and powerful
businessmen, some of the _Reddys_ of Nellore
district are providing a stiff though unsuccessful
(as of date) competition to the rich
_Kammas_ of coastal Andhra. They, too, were
landholders once upon a time, but their
lands have had little irrigation; the soil of
the district is sand where it is not gravel and
stone where it is neither. Capital can find
little of interest in the land and yet a section
of the landholders of the district has grown
into a strong group of multi-millionaire
businessmen, to rival the coastal Andhra lot.
They have built themselves up almost exclusively
on public works contracts. It will probably
be argued that the public works
--- roads for instance --- are used by capital to
transport goods and by peasants to transport
goods to be exchanged against capital, but
most of the roads are laid in summer and
get washed away in the monsoon and between
summer and monsoon there is little
time for capital to use them. Joking apart,
it is cantankerousness of a particularly painful kind
to argue that anything that' is used
by capital came into existence exclusively in
the interests of capital.

[^marnier]: Grand Marnier is a French brand of liquors. Its known for exploiting plantation workers & paying them starvation wages.

This is not meant as an aside. Agrarian
relations cannot be discussed without giving
central place to the Indian state's agrarian
policy, and without recognising that the
policy has never been merely the subordination
of agriculture to capital. In devising its
policy the state can be said to have had four
interests in mind: (i) to protect to the extent
possible the prosperity and power of the
class of landholders who emerged dominant
in the villages after the abolition of _zamindari_
type of tenures; (ii) to provide a variety
of fresh avenues (depending upon the
natural endowment of the respective regions)
for their enrichment, through its administrative,
fiscal, political and developmental
strategies, and also infrastructure for the
transfer of their wealth to non-agricultural
activities; (iii) to consolidate a broad support
base in the villages for the state, and
a broad market for capital, by co-opting a
section of the peasantry through tenancy
reforms, and infrastructural measures like
provision of electricity, irrigation, rural
banking, procurement, and subsidies for
costly inputs; and (iv) to keep the rural poor
quiet through promises and welfare half-measures,
and in case that fails, to put them
down brutally.

All these cannot be captured by viewing
'the village' as an _object_ for capital in India's
development or underdevelopment. Not only
the landlords but also the substantial
peasantry have also been a _subject_ of the
Indian state's policies. It has not modernised
agriculture --- to the extent it has --- just to aid
capital, but _also_ to enrich the propertied
classes of rural India; it has not introduced
co-operative financing of agricultural activities
merely to lubricate agrarian production
to suit the interests _of_ capital, but _also_
to provide cheap access to public funds for
the landholding classes as well as a new
source _of_ power for the landlords; its
marketing institutions, excise contracts,
public works contracts and _panchayat raj_
structures cannot be understood merely in
terms of the subordination of agriculture to
capital, without taking into account the
deliberate enrichment and entrenchment _of_
the rural rich, and the co-optation of a section
of the peasantry into both the market
and the polity as a support base. There was
perhaps a time and a clime 18th and 19th
century Europe --- when capital by itself
could have achieved all these changes. Today
it cannot. And all the third world states,
therefore, even as they serve the interests of
capital and allow and protect its expansion,
also adopt all other means historically and
politically viable to enrich and protect the
propertied classes and suppress the poor.
And that is why they cannot be fully comprehended
by capital-obsessed methodologies,
whose inadequacy is clearly evident
when they take the extreme form of centre-periphery
dependency theories. Nor can they
be overthrown by capital-obsessed strategies.

It is the whole structure that emerges as
a consequence of this development that
needs to be overthrown by the poor. The
rural poor must expropriate and take over
all the land of the rural rich, who today have
one foot on agriculture and one foot in
politics or the tertiary sector; impose a strict
(subsistence) ceiling of a family holding on
the better-off peasantry; divide the land
among the landless, initiate co-operative/collective
cultivation so that available resources
are conserved and centralised, and ensure
that of the surplus (which is today a tax-free
gift to the rural rich who take it mostly out
of the village), barring only the part that
goes for the overall industrialisation and
administration of the country, all the rest is
employed in rural areas to develop irrigation,
improve land management and soil conservation,
and expand rural works and
industries. This is the essence of the agrarian
revolution, which the CPI-ML groups since
_Naxalbari_ have seen as the axis of the new
democratic revolution; and with the agrarian
revolution integrated with the struggle against
capital, with which the agrarian structure has
a symbiotic relation of mutual dependence.

Finally, there is no merit in taking extreme
positions to prove a point. It is perilously
close to nonsense to say that wages of
agricultural labourers have never risen due
to wage struggles but only when the prosperity
of the peasants has made a rise possible.
In Andhra Pradesh, wherever anybody
(mostly the communists, but also a few non-communist
groups and voluntary agencies)
has bothered to organise the labourers there
has been a steady and widespread increase
of wages, even in areas which are not
agriculturally prosperous. The same must be
true of other states where the communists
have been active. It is good to know that the
_Shetkari Sanghatana_ is demanding higher
wages for labourers than radical organisations
dare to. Wages of labourers obviously
increase the easiest when those who pay
them decide to increase them, and such
employers must be reckoned intelligent
people, but what is the point that is sought
to be proved? Is there any historical or
philosophical reason for believing that those
who achieve high wage increases have any
interest in the revolution or, contrariwise,
that those who cannot obtain wage increases
are incapable of making a revolution?
