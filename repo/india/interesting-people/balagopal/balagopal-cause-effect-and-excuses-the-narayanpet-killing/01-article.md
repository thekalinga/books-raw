There must be many who thought after the Narayanpet killing, 'now the Government is going to
ban the _Maoists_'. It is an entirely understandable feeling, but entirely illogical.

Understandable because there is much that is objectionable about that killing. There should be,
even to those who are not opponents of revolutionary politics. The issue of violence is not
fruitfully discussed if it is posed as an issue of violence _per se_. Such a discussion soon becomes
sterile. It is more fruitfully posed in terms of Justice in the _means and ends equation_; a sense of
value for human life as such, even the life of one's political enemy; an attitude of responsibility
in the matter of extreme choices; proportionality in dealing out violent justice, etc. The
Narayanpet killing can be faulted on all these counts. The Makthal MLA Chittem Narsi Reddy's
clan does consist of men who are most politely described when they are called _factionists_.
Gadwal is a miniature Rayalaseema, and its destinies have been dominated at will by the 'D.K.
Brothers': Samarasimha Reddy and Bharathasimha Reddy, the latter of whom is the husband of
the Narsi Reddy's daughter D.K.Aruna, the present MLA of Gadwal. There is little the brothers
have not done to further their power. Secondly, the _Maoists_' allegation against Narsi Reddy's
son Venkateswara Reddy, namely that he is the protector of spurious _toddy_ business, may very
well be a posthumous excuse invented along the way, but it is a fact that it is the area running
north from Gadwal along the border with Karnataka that sees the highest incidence of deaths due
to adulterated _toddy_ in the State. People die like flies here.

Yet, Narsi Reddy himself was not in any real sense a credible candidate for the appellation
'enemy of the people', unless all politicians are put in the class, and as for the others who died in
the random shoot-out, it is doubtful that the _Maoists_ even knew all their names, let alone their
crimes. It is evident to those who will not be apologists for the _Maoists_ that the Narayanpet
killing was intended to terrorise the Congress Party and Government, and that is why it had to be
a reckless massacre.

But the feeling is illogical, nevertheless. The ban will not give the State Government one little bit
more power than they already have today to tackle _naxalite violence_. And it will definitely hinder
any reasonable response to the criticism many have been making, namely that handling _naxalism_
shall not be reduced to handling _naxalite violence_. The _AP Public Security Act_ is a rather mild
law, as penal laws go. The maximum punishment under the Act is three years imprisonment. It
does not carry the obnoxious provisions such as _in camera_ trials, shifting of the onus of proof
onto the accused, making confessions given to a police officer admissible in evidence, etc., as
did _TADA_ and _POTA_. What is objectionable about that Act is not that its provisions are harsh,
but that it is a political instrument disguised as penal law. What it proscribes is not violence ---
which has been proscribed ever since the birth of the State in history --- but social sympathy and
political like-mindedness with the view point and the aims of the _Maoists_. The ban on the
_Revolutionary Writers Association (RWA)_ is proof of this, if proof were needed. As such, its
targets will not be the armed cadre such as those who killed the MLA, Narsi Reddy and eight
others. The targets will be the ordinary masses who have their own reasons for sympathising
with the _naxalites_, and the intellectuals who find themselves ideologically persuaded by _Mao's
thought_. And human rights activists, writers and social analysts who will question the State's
tendentious vilification of the _naxalites_, and its inhuman strategies for handling them.

Yet, it is not as if the Narayanet killing has no real relevance to the action that unfolded
subsequently, namely the ban imposed on the _Maoists_. It has helped to justify the ban in the
minds of an overwhelming section of the people. It has helped to show the _Maoists_ in the image
that the Government likes: cruel, sadistic killers, callous in their indifference to human life,
drunk as they are with a self-righteous image of themselves and their vocation. This may not be a
fair image, in general, but there have been so many instances of their conduct that support such
an image, that the effect is understandable.

And so, in a sense, the _Maoists_ will be paying for their thoughtless act. It is unlikely that they
will regret it, for it is their want to regard severe repression as the normal state of affairs. But the
question is not whether they can take the ban in their stride. Their organisation being almost
entirely underground, they may have little difficulty in doing so. And they have never been
particularly concerned that their actions may bring the police down upon their supporters. The
question is what it will do to democracy in the sense of a regime assuring freedom of political
choice, freedom from arbitrary police action, freedom to agitate to better one's life, etc. It will
certainly not do any good, and if Y.S.Rajasekhar Reddy is patting himself on the back for having
cleverly used the Narayanpet outrage, he must be informed that cleverness in the service of
undemocratic strategies is not only no virtue, but is not good policy either, as his predecessor
who thinks he is the cleverest fellow going around discovered to his mortification.
