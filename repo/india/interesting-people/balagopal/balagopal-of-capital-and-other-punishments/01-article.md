_In a country like India where extreme social stratification and
increasing social turmoil are likely to sharply affect the ideas and
opinions of people, including judicial officers, putting in human hands
the discretion to take life can he quite dangerous. Conflict and
turmoil apart, the very deep stratification of Indian society makes
even-handed dispensation of justice a problematic thing in the best of
times. We live in times of severe social turmoil and the ascendance of
the extremely illiberal politics of the Hindu fanatics. As this mood
catches on we are going to find the courts silently handing out more
and more harsh punishments bending backward to look at evidence
from the policeman's point of view and sending more and more
people to the hangman. It is in this context that the debate on capital
punishment must be conducted._

\

\

The debate about death penalty is one
of the endless debates of modern times.
That it is endless is understandable, for
there is death at both ends of the argument:
the one who is to be killed at the hands
of justice has himself killed, usually at
the irrigation of his own sense of justice,
or (more commonly), injustice. And so
every argument about the preciseness,
the sacredness or the merely secular right
to life can be answered with equal force
from the other end. Small wonder then
that the argument goes in circles. There
are those like V R Krishna Iyer who lakes
the consistent stand that all life is precious
and nobody --- nobody at all --- has the right
to take life, lie bases his stand as an
abolitionist on this argument (among
others). The anti-abolitionist may argue
that notwithstanding the consistency of
this position, while the state may well
heed its reason and desist from hanging
murderers, citizens are unlikely to give
up killing, and Krishna Iyer's pleas are
not going to stop them. So may not the
state hang a few of them to deter a few
others from killing, and thereby save some
lives --- precious lives --- in the aggregate?

Not that Krishna Iyer has no other
arguments left, but he would have to leave
the terrain of preciousness of life to continue
the debate. Preciousness (spiritual
or secular) of life is a meaningful moral
value, but it is an inadequate ground for
distinguishing the two ends of the
argument about _capital punishment_. The
efficacy of execution as a form of punishment
then enters the debate. And so
we have arguments about the purpose,
effect or impact of _capital punishment_ as
an act of state. Here the two poles of the
argument are less symmetrical and hence
the debate is more fruitful. That it is still
inconclusive is a reflection of the fact that
we would rather not punish anybody at
all in the name of justice, for the cruelty
that is inherent in punishment, any
punishment and not just execution, is at
odds with the lofty sense conveyed by the
expression Justice, and yet we do realise
that we cannot as yet (perhaps forever)
do away with socially inflicted
punishment, even if we feel confident
enough about our civilisational strength
to rule out _private revenge_ as a legitimate
response to crime, for then the weak
(whether by virtue of social structure or
contingent factors) would be at the mercy
of the strong. Then, where exactly do we
draw the line between just and unjust
punishments? How do we ensure a
criterion of punishment that will
simultaneously be just to the one who has
committed the crime (for a signal
difference between _private revenge_ and
_public justice_ as a response to crime is
that the latter must do justice to both
sides) and yet leave us with the confidence
that by its operation it will ensure that the
weak are safe from the depredations of
the strong (which is the only rationale --- and
real one --- for the existence of a _public
justice_ system)? This is not a very easy
question to answer.

One way out of the dilemma is to reject
the claim of contemporary justice that its
punishments are intended to protect the
weak from the strong. One may argue that
on the contrary the law in contemporary
society (in its essence) actually protects
the strong from the weak, and that is what
its norms and the punishment it inflicts
upon transgressors of the norms are aimed
at (again, in essence). The primary or
essential function of law and justice, in
such a critique, is to protect property and
unequal order from the property-less and
the oppressed, and not the protection of
the weak from the strong, and hence the
rationale claimed for the punishments the
law inflicts is spurious. This pulls the rug
from under the feet of the _criminal justice
system_ and leaves no basis for the defence
of death penalty, or any penalty for that
matter.

There is undoubtedly a certain force to
this argument, whether or not it can be
established that the primary or essential
role of law and justice is the protection
of the privileged classes from their victims.
That depends on where one locates the
primacy or the essence, and how one
understands those terms. If primacy is
understood in the sense of determination
and is deduced from the _a priori_ theoretical
position that the determinate role of the
law (as a moment or element of the social
superstructure) is the protection of
property relations, then evidently so long
as property relations are unequal, the law's
essential function would be the protection
of property from the property-less, and
any rationale it claims on the ground of
the occasional protection it offers to the
weak from the strong only serves to
legitimate its essentially iniquitous role.
If, on the other hand, primacy or essence
is not understood in the sense of
determination but the significance that
law and parameters of justice have (a
significance they share with ethical norms
codified in religion and custom) in the
historical search for norms of human
relations in a humanist paradigm of
history, which search runs through and
is stamped by but not negated or rendered
meaningless by the gamut of unequal
social systems and hierarchical orders that
the history has traversed, then it is doubtful
that the protection of privilege from those
that lack privilege can be described as the
primary or essential, let alone determinant,
role of law and justice (as well as ethics)
in history as we know it, though it is
evidently one significant role they play.
In speaking of such a search, it must be
added as a matter of caution, for the history
of this century dictates caution in inventing
or discovering supra-human 'agency' in
may still be pointed out that they do not
always target those who are responsible
for their iniquitous situation but rather
take it out on society in a random manner,
often injuring equally helpless people.
The killers of Rajiv Gandhi, whatever
their reason for taking revenge upon the
former prime minister of India, also killed
a lot of other bystanders. Chalapati Rao
and Vijayavardhana Rao killed bus
passengers who were in no way
responsible for their poverty and unemployment,
much less their status as
_dalits_ in Hindu society. Muslim youth
who feel they are justifiably driven to
violence by the fast increasing intolerance
of Hindu society take revenge with their
bombs on train or bus passengers at
random. Thus, the argument against death
penalty based on social considerations is
less attractive than it appears at first sight,
for there are (usually) helpless victims at
both ends. But it is nevertheless not
rendered in valid, for the two are not
symmetrical. There is either compulsive
or thoughtless violence on one side and
structured iniquity and systematic prejudice
on the other. What this consideration
tells us is not that we should be
heedless about the social consequences
of the retention of the death penalty, but
rather that marginalised groups should be
politically cautioned against wayward acts
of revenge, and that we should under no
conditions indulge in unthinking glorification
of all 'subaltern' rebellion, seen
in isolation from surrounding social and
moral conditions, within a binary (elite
vs subaltern) universe.

But ignoring for the moment these social
considerations and reverting to the question
whether the retention of a rarely
imposed death penalty serves any purpose
at all, it may be argued even if it is imposed
rarely, the very presence of the penalty
will act as a deterrent. The fear should
be there in the heart of every would be
murderer that he may --- just may --- be
hanged. That, it will probably be said,
will act as sufficient deterrent. To tell the
truth, it will also afford us the moral
satisfaction that _retribution_ is available in
law for the victim. Punishment is perforce
discussed these days in terms of _deterrence_,
both inside the courts and outside, for we
have reached a stage in civilisation where
one does not in polite talk speak of revenge
as a legitimate response to crime, but a
stronger motivating factor that beats in all
hearts --- judicial as well as lay --- is a desire
for _retribution_, which is a somewhat inoffensive
sounding substitute for plain
old revenge. The special judge of the
TADA court at Poonamallee, Chennai,
who sentenced the whole lot of the accused
he tried in the Rajiv Gandhi case to death,
explained his decision in the language of
_deterrence_: that hereafter, no foreign
conspirators or terrorists may use Indian
soil for their nefarious conspiracies.
Karthikeyan, the CBI chief who prepared
the charge-sheet, is said to have exclaimed
to press persons outside the court that
_retribution_ had been done. Were not the
judge and the policemen really saying the
same thing, though the former put it in
the reasonable sounding language of
_deterrence_, for _deterrence_ of crime may
be accepted as one of the rational aims of
judicial punishment, and the other more
popular language of _retribution_, which is
revenge with the subject transferred from
the victim to impersonal morality ? Legal
theories of punishment describe _deterrence_
and _retribution_ as two distinct aims or
modes of understanding of punishment,
but in fact the argument of _deterrence_
often hides behind it a desire for revenge,
_vicarious revenge_, which is given a moral
tone by being described as _retribution_.
We all feel that the one who has caused
suffering must suffer in equal measure
and only then justice is done. This feeling
is one of the universal of the human
moral sense and lies behind much thinking
about formal or informal punishment. To
the extent that the individual who has
caused the suffering is fully, solely and
consciously responsible (which means,
never at all) for that act, there is nothing
very perverse about this common feeling.
But the question is whether _public justice_
 --- justice done in the name of society
--- must stop with this personalised notion
of justice, or incorporate within its
understanding the notion of reform
through compassion and mercy taught by
the greatest teachers (religious or secular)
of social ethics, and the considerations
advanced by the more recent analysis of
the social and psychological causation of
crime. The desire for _retribution_, often
hidden behind the reasonable sounding
language of _punitive deterrence_, is
ignorant of both the compassion of the
ancient moral teachers and the modern
sociology of crime.

But since _deterrence_ is the strongest
argument for the retention of stringent
punishments, including _capital punishment_,
it will not do to 'deconstruct' it
to discover a desire for _retribution_
hidden behind it and then proceed to
refute the reasonableness of _retributive
justice_. The argument about _retribution_
can come later, but let us deal with
_deterrence_ as such, taking it at face
value, notwithstanding that its cold
calculus often hides an irrational passion
for revenge.

# DETERRENCE --- A VALID END OF JUSTICE

Is _deterrence_ of crime a valid end of
justice, and therefore a valid measure of
punishment? The moment we pose this
question we are confronted with a certain
unease, which brings back the radical
critique of law into our argument. In
speaking of the legitimacy of _deterrence_
of crime as an end of the _criminal justice
system_, we seem to be accepting the
legitimacy of the law's notion of crime
_in toto_. But there is crime and crime, and
not all of it is criminal to every view point.
There is the crime of the landless poor
who trespass on to the land of the rich
who have acquired it (whether lawfully or
not) other than by the honest sweat of the
brow. There is the crime of the
systematically oppressed person who
breaks out of the bonds of oppression one
day to do away with the oppressor. There
is, on the other hand, the crime of
untouchability, rape or dowry killing. And
further there is (on the third hand, shall
we say) the crime of a drunken brawl on
a pay day's evening. Which is the crime
whose _deterrence_ one is talking about?
To say that punitive justice may validly
seek to deter rape is atleast a sensible
proposition. To say that it may seek to
deter neighbours from coming to blows
over the disposition of a boundary wall
makes less sense but still some sense. But
to say that it may seek to deter the poor
from encroaching upon a rich man's estate
even to put up a hut, or a battered wife
from breaking a brick on her husband's
head when he is safely asleep, does not
even seem to make sense as an end of
justice.

One may then make out two lists of
crimes: one which one will accept as truly
a list of crimes, and with reference to
which one will discuss the question of
_deterrence_, and a second which one will
not accept as crimes at all, let alone discuss
the merits of deterrent action for preventing
them. The difficulty with this
strategy lies not only in the obvious fact
that different people, or atleast different
social groups, are bound to have different
lists, thus rendering the notion of
'_deterrence_ of crime' impossible to discuss
in concrete terms. More than this is the
difficulty that even within a given
classification, there are bound to be many
uncertain cases, too many to make it a
usable classification at all. For instance,
let us grant that it is not a crime for a
landless person to encroach upon a big
estate to put up a hut or to carve out a
plot to cultivate. Is it also not a crime to
encroach upon the land of a two-acre
peasant? Or a half-acre peasant? It is not
a crime, let us grant, for a wife subjected
to regular beating to poison her husband's
coffee. But what if it is a lesser matter
of marital discord? And so on. Anyone
who tries to break up penal law into those
crimes that one will (from whichever point
of view) definitely accept as crimes, and
those that one definitely will not, will
discover that there are too many undecidable
cases to make it a worthwhile
classification.

But there is an ever greater problem.
Law's universality is a necessary precondition
for _rule of law_ to be operational
Used. You cannot have a fractured
universality for law and still have a society
and state where _rule of law_ prevails. If
each of us is allowed to pick and choose
that part of law which we will accept as
legitimate, will abide by, and expect the
state to force everybody else to abide by,
and if this list (apart from its inevitable
indefiniteness) changes from person to
person (or atleast social group to group)
then no kind of law-bound society or state
is possible. Why should that worry us, it
will be asked. That should worry us
because a lawless society and state are
most injurious to the weak and the
vulnerable. However iniquitous a given
law or legal system may be, there can be
nothing more iniquitous and injurious for
the poor and the weak than a society in
which there is no _rule of law_ at all. (One
is not speaking here of small or ethnically
uniform custom-bound communities that
need no law at all). Hence, what we require.
in the interests of the poor and the weak,
is not an attitude that rejects the legitimacy
of the law as such, but one that accepts
it, but without giving up a critical attitude
towards the social content and significance
of the statutes and legal practices that
make up the law. (Ofcourse, if the law
is itself fractured by denying equality of
all before itself, and minimum respect for
the person of all, then that is no _rule of
law_ at all, and these considerations do not
apply to such legal systems). It may be
objected that this caveat that one does not
give up a critical attitude towards the law
is intended only to salvage one's troubled
conscience and serves no purpose when
the legitimacy of the law as such is
concede! That is not the case. Indeed, this
critical attitude is precisely where a
meaningful radical engagement is taken
up with the _criminal justice system_ (whose
legitimacy as such must be conceded a
priori in the interests of a law-bound
society outside which the poor and the
weak would be helpless). The critical
attitude would help the struggle for
sensitising the law to its social context
and content, that is, give it a sense of
social equality over and above the legal
equality and respect for persons that it
must possess to be called law at all, thereby
paving the way for a progressive
democratization of the law that would
simultaneously make the law less
oppressive and leave open more freedom
for positive acts of social transformation.
There could well be situations where such
transformation would require breaking
with the law (not individual laws, whose
infringement is common in any effort at
transformation, but law as such) but that
would only be a temporary interregnum
and even then an extreme choice whose
ineluctability must be stark enough to
compensate the injury that the total fracture
of _rule of law_ does to the people, especially
the weak and the vulnerable. More
germane to the present discussion is that
accepting the legitimacy of the _criminal
justice system_ as such, but maintaining
an attitude of criticism towards its social
content, in particular' which act is called
a _crime_ and how much of a crime, helps
one evolve a useful critique of the punitive
aspect of the law, including the
meaning and content of often used expressions
such as _deterrence_ and _deterrent
punishment_.

Let us now get back to the question:
is _deterrence_ of crime (any crime) a valid
end of justice, and therefore a valid norm
of punishment? It is indeed a valid end
of justice, provided it is understood that
it is only one of its ends and not the whole
of it, and also provided it is understood
that only a part and not the whole of the
burden of _deterrence_ is upon the _criminal
justice system_. Justice being more than
the prevention of crime, _deterrence_ can
only be one of its tasks. And _public justice_
being justice done in the name of and on
behalf of society, it is society as a whole
that carries the burden of deterring crime,
the _criminal justice system_ carrying only
the appropriate part of the burden . And
the role of _deterrence_ as a norm of judicial
punishment must be located within this
understanding.

As an aim of punishment, the concept
of _deterrence_ is used in three different
senses (even in judicial pronouncements):
(i) the possibility of punishment acts as
a deterrent to crime; (ii) the punishment
deters the criminal from repeating the
crime; and (iii) punishment given to one
criminal will deter others from committing
the crime. Since all three meanings are
jumbled up and produced as a single
argument in defence of harsh punishment
for heinous crimes, it is necessary to
separate them out. Of the three, only (i)
is valid, and that too within limits, but
not (ii) or (iii). To measure punishment
by the requirement that the criminal should
not repeat the offence is to assume that
circumstances impelling the crime are of
no importance and the criminal's will is
all. It is indeed close to assuming that
crime springs from a permanent part of
the person's character, which will repeat
itself ever and again unless deterred by
violent punishment. Even if there is
something kinky about the person's
character, punishment may not be the best
way to ensure that the crime is not repeated.
Towards one who has committed an
offence, the proper attitude would be to
seek methods of helping him grow out of
whatever it was that impelled him to
commit the offence. In other words, an
attitude of reform, not only of the person
but also of his circumstances. Reform of
person is likely to work better with _crimes
born of perversity_ of outlook than _crimes
of passion or want_. With _crimes of want_
what needs to be reformed is less the
convict than the conditions of his life. But
perhaps a little of both will be required
in all cases, for these causes of crime are
difficult to sort out in pure form. However,
_reform of person_ does not mean merely
lecturing or counselling the person. It
would (except in unusual circumstances)
include some punishment which would
entail the convict forgoing something ---
freedom, comfort, etc. --- that is part of
normal life. It may also involve some
positive activity on his part, whether the
kind of labour that convicts in Indian
prisons undertake or work that has more
of the character of service to other people.
Punishment of some sort is therefore
integral to the process of reform of the
person, to the extent that it is reform of
the person and not of his circumstances
that justice calls for. And it is this role
of punishment --- the role of rendering the
convict repentant or atleast in a mood to
contemplate himself and his circumstances,
and therefore amenable to the
process of correction that should determine
its severity, insofar as we are thinking of
punishment _vis-à-vis_ one who has already
committed a proven crime. Deterrence in
the sense of (ii) is an illegitimate notion.
Can _capital punishment_ be a possible
punishment from this point of view?
Evidently not, for you don't put anybody
in a repentant of reflecting frame of mind
by chopping his head off. Exceptionally
pathological cases are best shifted to what
are popularly called 'mental hospitals'.

The meaning (iii) given to _deterrence_
should not be confused with (i), The latter
simply says that the statutory indication
of punishment is necessary as a deterrent
to crime. The former goes well beyond
this, to an impermissible extent. It says
X should be given such a punishment that
Y will be deterred from committing that
offence in future, whoever that Y may be
and whatever his circumstances. That
makes X responsible for not only the
crime he has committed, which is permissible
provided he is not automatically
saddled with the full responsibility minus
necessary consideration of the circumstances
in which he authored the crime,
but also for the crimes unknown others
may commit in the unknowable future.
The only example the law can legitimately
make of one for others is to show that the
punishment that is written in the statute
book will actually be imposed, if and
where the culpability is established, and
is not merely decorative. But the punishment
actually awarded should be strictly
guided by correctional considerations
relevant to that person, and not that of
setting an 'example' to others. When the
TADA special judge at Chennai says that
he is sentencing to death all the 26 persons
he has tried so that other such conspirators
may not spill blood on Indian soil in the
furtherance of their 'anti-national' designs,
he is using the notion of _deterrence_ in the
impermissible sense of (iii) and not the
permissible sense of (i).

If this is clear, then can _capital punishment_
be justified by the role of _deterrence_
in the sense of (i)? Is death penalty (even
if rarely imposed) a necessary deterrent
for the crime of murder (the only common
crime for which it is imposed in India)?
We have said earlier that punishment has
a role to play in correction, too. The
possibility of punishment also acts as a
deterrent. Nobody is deterred by the threat
that _if you commit a crime, you will be
reformed in jail_. The punishment part of
the reformative effort can act as a deterrent.
The actual punishment given must never
be 'deterrent' but only as much as is
necessary as an accompaniment of correctional
efforts. But the maximum
possible punishment may be fixed from
the point of view of deterring crime. Is
the maximum of death sentence a
necessary deterrent for homicide? Let us
forget the empirical evidence for a while:
studies conducted in countries which have
abolished the death penalty (56 countries
have statutorily abolished it, and close to
100 have got rid of it for all practical
purposes) show that death penalty has
little additional deterrent effect, that is the
rate of commission of crimes punishable
with death has not increased significantly
after the abolition. Such a study can be
done in India, too. The princely state of
Travancore-Cochin had abolished the
death penalty for a while before it became
part of India. When it became part of the
union in 1947, it got the Indian Penal
Code along with the other blessings of
accession. It would be worthwhile making
a comparison of the number of crimes of
murder per-capita registered in that part
of Kerala during and after abolition. It is
unlikely that such a study will reveal a
trend contrary to what has been the
experience elsewhere. The reason is not
that punishment has no relation to crime
(in which case it would be no deterrent
at all) but rather that the two are not so
simply or linearly related --- like the two
sides of a balance --- that when the one
goes up the other goes down to the same
extent. Between crime and punishment
there lies the whole sphere of human
existence, social, economic, political,
cultural and the purely individual.

But such studies apart, let us look at
the logic of this argument that the provision
of death penalty can alone be an adequate
deterrent for murders, The logic appears
to be that the threat: 'if you take a life'
then you will have to lose yours' will
alone work effectively, and it should be
present in the law, if only as a rare option.
That is to say, like suffering for suffering
caused (if only in the rarest of rare cases)
is necessary as a deterrent. But why does
this logic apply only to homicide? Why
not to all crimes? If a hand is chopped
off, the court does not order the chopping
off of the convict's hands, but only a few
years in jail. There will never be like
suffering because even after a few years
in jail, the convict will be able-bodied
whereas the victim will be without a hand
all his life. Yet nobody would argue that
hand-chopping for hand-chopping (atleast
in the rarest of rare cases) would alone
be an adequate deterrent. Or arson for
arson, destruction of property for
destruction of property, etc. (And what
would be an effective deterrent for rape
in this logic? Chopping off the penis?)
On the contrary, any such suggestion
would undoubtedly produce protests about
the medieval logic of 'eye for eye and
tooth for tooth' and would bring forth
outraged comparisons with Saudi Arabia,
the Taliban's Afghanistan and all those
countries ruled by mullahs than which we
all believe we are infinitely more civilised. But
why is this logic of _like suffering for
suffering_ caused preferred in the case of
the death sentence alone?

The death penalty excepted, the modern
Indian penal law has a uniform punishment
for all crimes (excepting very petty ones,
for which a monetary fine may suffice),
which is supposed to simultaneously act
as both deterrent and corrective. The
convict is deprived of freedom and comfort
by being jailed for a certain period. The
prospect of such deprivation is supposed
to act as a deterrent, as well as keeping
society out of his arms' reach for a while,
and the fact of deprivation is expected to
engender in the convict a state of remorse
that may act as a corrective, though very
little is done positively for correctional
purposes by our penal system. There is
no need to break with this logic and invoke
the _deterrence_ of eye for an eye as an
exceptional punishment for murder. What
is needed, on the contrary, is to further
humanise this logic of incarceration as
deterrent as well as corrective, that is to
think of less in human _deterrence_ and more
positive correction. People who have
never seen the insides of an Indian jail
may feel that 'inhuman' is too harsh a
word, considering that Indian prisoners
these days (atleast in the less benighted
states) get three meals a day, with meat
once a week and opportunity to play
outdoor games and watch TV (usually
once or twice a week). Our prisons are
nevertheless less than human, firstly
because the quality of the food given is
usually very poor, and overcrowding (all
Indian jails are overcrowded to the tune
of 50 to 100 per cent of their capacity)
makes the jails extremely unhygienic. But
that apart, the prisoners are deliberately
made to feel less than human, as part of
the tactics of prison 'discipline'. All wielders
of authority know that the simplest way
to control their subjects is to structure
their relation with authority in such a way
that they are systematically made to feel
less than human. Beating at the slightest
excuse is one way to achieve this. But
even the refusal to have a dialogue with
the prisoners on even the most inoffensive
matters; and instead converting all
situations of possible dialogue into fearful
supplication on one side and unreasoning
refusal or inattention on the other,
compounded by humiliating abuse and
physical violence at the slightest provocation,
creates an ambience of a circus
ring rather than a place where human
beings are incarcerated for correctional
purposes.

This is not accidental. I am not speaking
here of any functional need of the ruling
classes to create subhuman prison conditions
as a strategy of stable governance.
That degree of rationality is difficult to
demonstrate though easy to declaim. But
subhuman prison conditions is
systematic and not accidental in a different
sense. Most, policemen and prison officials
(and, I dare say, many judges too) believe
that the prison sentences provided by the
penal law are by themselves not sufficiently
efficacious as a deterrent of crime,
and must be supplemented by an inhuman
treatment that is no where written in the
law. This feeling is linked to the lowly
perception that minions of the state have
for crime and criminals who mostly come
from the lowest strata of the caste system.
That is to say, the humanism of
correctional incarceration may be alright
for civilised people like you and me but
not for the likes of the castes and
communities that are found committing
crimes most often. (This remark is not
imagined. It is frequently expressed by
police and prison officials, and quite
frequently lies behind the attitudes of
officers of the courts)

The point of saying all this is that there
should be better and less inhuman ways
of ensuring a _deterrent punishment_ than
locking up convicts in prisons controlled
by jail officers who are all convinced in
the heart of hearts that mere incarceration
in a prison is no _deterrence_ to the criminal,
especially the criminal who comes from
the wretched dregs of Hindu society. Nor
do these prison officers have any motivation
for correctional work. A correctional
institution needs some degree of
idealism, which is singularly absent from
the mental make-up of the jail officers.
But they are not alone to blame. The
Indian prison as an institution has no
correctional system as such, though it
teaches the convicts some manual trade
and provides them with what passes for
a library to read from. More often than
not, a prisoner comes out of jail at the end
of his term a more hardened and less
useful human being than he was when he
went in. And that serves neither the
purpose of _deterrence_ nor reform. What
the Indian prisons need today is a less
harsh regime of imprisonment and a more
positive correctional approach. Calls for
imposition or retention of harsh punishment,
including _capital punishment_, have
no place in this.

Let us move on now to a different plane
of argument. I will try to argue that
imperfect societies have no right to impose
harsh punishments and that (as indicated
earlier), punishment alone cannot be
society's response to crime. The latter is
very important today because not only in
India but all over the world, the rise of
political terrorism and other forms of
organised law-breaking is sought to be
made a justification for harsh punitive
regimes. Imperfection has long been one
of the abolitionist arguments, but that is
imperfection of judicial appreciation of
evidence, both because of human error
and the social prejudices or world view
held by the judge. _Capital punishment_ has
a finality to it that would be justified,
other things apart, only by a perfect
investigation and perfection in the judicial
act of weighing the evidence, Neither is
humanly possible. We remember Kehar
Singh, the alleged conspirator in Indira
Gandhi's murder, about whom all that
was proved was that he conferred in
secrecy with her assassins, but who was
nevertheless found fit to hang. It may well
be that judges from the _court of sessions_
to the Supreme Court who believed then
that it was just to hang him will have
second thoughts some time later, for the
judgement has been criticised by even
otherwise not particularly radical people.
But nobody can give back Kehar Singh
his life. (There is a more recent case from
England. Derek Bentley. hanged 45 years
ago for abetment of a policemen's killing,
has been now pronounced wrongly
executed. The profusion of apologies
rendered to his family will not resurrect
the dead man.)

A different dimension of imperfection
arises from social and political passions
and prejudices that judges are as much
prone to as anybody else. Not that they
never make any effort to achieve
objectivity. One may grant that much to
judicial discipline, but there is no
guarantee that they will always succeed,
which guarantee is mandated by the
finality of _capital punishment_, especially
in times of social crisis and turbulence
when even the need to make the effort
may not be urgently felt. But it is precisely
in such times that both judicial and extra-judicial
execution are likely to be more
frequent, thereby leaving the socially and
politically abnormal groups and
individuals all the more vulnerable to
execution by prejudice. An instance is the
rhetoric of the Chennai special judge's
reasoning in the Rajiv Gandhi murder
case, in which all the 26 conspirators and
abettors (only the conspirators and abettors
fell to the judge's lot, for the actual
perpetrators of the offence had all died
before the law could catch them) were
sentenced to death. Half of them are Sri
Lankan Tamils and the other half their
local collaborators, and so the judge could
indulge in patriotic anger about foreign
terrorists executing their nefarious design
on Indian soil. The LTTE connection being
a fatal political sin in the current political
mood --- so much so that it could even
bring down a government at the centre
 --- it is not surprising that the rhetoric
should end with a wholesale death
sentence. The judgment has been
described by what the press calls 'eminent
jurists' as extraordinary, but suitable for
an extraordinary case. Their memory is
unfortunately not able to recall that even
assuming that the murder of an eminent
political personality is deemed different
from that of a person in the street (Article
14 of the Constitution says otherwise),
there was another Gandhi, certainly a
more eminent one, who was murdered 50
years ago, in whose case only the
perpetrator was hanged and not the abettor.
It is in the case of the two later Gandhis,
mother and son, that abettors were found
fit to be' hanged. Judicial perception of
culpability is evidently quite sensitive to
changing political conditions. Such being
the case' can the judiciary be trusted with
the power to order execution of people?
Quite some time back, the US supreme
court had ruled that death penalty is
discriminatory because it puts in human
hands the arbitrary power of deciding
which crime is worthy of _capital
punishment_. That the US law-makers
found a way of getting around this
judgment, and that country continues to
be one of the staunchest defenders of
_capital punishment_, does not rob this
observation of its reason. Especially in a
country like India where extreme social
stratification and increasing turmoil are
likely to sharply affect the ideas and
opinions of people, including judicial
officers, putting in human hands the discretion
to take life can be quite dangerous.
It is extraordinary that, on the contrary,
people find it possible to argue that
precisely because of the social turmoil
that defines contemporary India, _capital
punishment_ is needed as a deterrent, as
if the turmoil does not affect judicial
minds to the detriment of their impartiality,
and as if the harm that can do to those
on the margin of society is a matter of
no consideration. Conflict and turmoil
apart, the very deep stratification of Indian
society makes even-handed dispensation
of justice a problematic thing in the best
of times. All those familiar with the
_criminal justice system_ are aware of the
extreme hostility exhibited by the system
--- policemen, judges and lawyers too
--- towards thieves, robbers and dacoits, not
merely because of the respect for property
that one may expect to find in the judicial
systems of all countries, but also (perhaps
more) because the perpetrators of such
crime (in particular, dacoit gangs) come
from castes and communities that are held
in loathing and contempt, often even more
than the untouchable communities, by
caste Hindu society.

But these are arguments concerning the
imperfection of judicial decision-making.
Over and above that is the imperfection
of society's --- any society's --- moral order.
Let us turn to that now and argue the point
that imperfect societies (in a specified
sense) have no right to claim the privilege
of harsh punishments. This may appear
obvious, but it is necessary to argue
carefully from first principles, for
otherwise it may end up as mere rhetoric.
Let us begin with the question: Can a
_public justice_ system take a person's life
in the name of punishment, and still be
said to have done justice? The question
is not: is it at all just to take life.
Notwithstanding the valuable caution of
the fundamentalists of non-violence, that
we who have no capacity to create life
have no right to take it, we can all nevertheless
imagine situations of extreme
oppression wherein the taking of the life
of the oppressor cannot but be called a
just act, which is of course no argument
for a cavalier attitude towards all violence
claimed to be perpetrated in the name of
equity. Our question is more closely
circumscribed: is it permissible for the
institution of _public justice_ to kill as a
measure of punishment for crime, any
crime?

Let us try to answer this question: What
exactly does a court of justice do when
it awards punishment to an offender? In
a civil offence, justice recompenses the
wronged person, that is clear. It hands
back the misappropriated property, it
restores the breached contract, or it
computes and awards monetary
compensation when such restoration is
not possible. But that is not what it does
in a criminal offence. Whether it is
punishing as a deterrent measure, or as
_retribution_, or as a measure of reform, it
is doing something other than recompense
the victim except to the extent that
punishment aimed at _retribution_ gives
some mental satisfaction to the victim or
the victim's survivors. This satisfaction
is frequently quoted by judges, though in
impersonal terms, such as the 'moral anger
or outrage of society' that needs to be
answered or assuaged by the punishment
awarded. This is often the argument used
by judges to justify the award of harsh
punishment when they sense that the usual
argument of _deterrence_ is not enough to
justify the severity of the punishment
they have chosen to impose.

Strictly speaking, this language should
have no place in judicial thinking, though
quite erudite judges continue to employ
it, for if the desire for revenge that the
victim of a criminal offence feels and with
which society identifies or empathise
--- so that judges find it possible to say _we
have to answer society's moral outrage_
instead of _we have to satisfy the victim's
vengeance_ --- can be a rational criterion
of judicial punishment, then the judiciary
is nothing but a seemingly public
institution for serving _private revenge_, a
seemingly dispassionate forum for
satisfying private passion. But _private
revenge_ is explicitly ruled out by modern
law as an answer to crime. Even the most
morally justified revenge is disallowed.
Can it then be smuggled in through the
back door, dressed up in black robes,
speaking the language of society's _moral
conscience_, and set up as a legitimate
norm of punishment? Is it that the law's
aversion to _private revenge_ is only that
it is private and not that it is revenge?

That is not the case. Human thinking
about crime has always tended to see it,
at least in one aspect, not as an injury to
the person affected by the crime, but as
an act upsetting society's moral order,
that is the norms that define the contours
of legitimate behaviour. Modern law has
explicitly accepted this as the central
characteristic of crime. A crime --- whether
it is theft, rape or murder --- is primarily an
offence against society, and only
secondarily against its victim. Whatever
the defects of this notion (one defect
frequently pointed out is that it transfers
the victim's 'agency' as seeker of justice
to the state acting on behalf of society,
but that is not always avoidable nor
necessarily bad), and whatever objection
one has to society's moral order and its
norms that are thereby shown as universal
and legitimised (this objection too is well
taken, but only up to a point, unless one
can show that there is no element of
universality at all in the given society's
normative order), this is a useful
perspective, for it allows us to think in
terms that go beyond injury and revenge,
prevention and punitive violence. If crime
is that which upsets society's moral order,
then punishment should be guided by the
consideration of setting right the normative
order disrupted. And the giving of the
punishment is society's act, even if it is
a particular institution of society that tries
and punishes offences on behalf of society.

That we are speaking of the moral order
and not just the legal order needs emphasis.
Merely saying that a crime upsets society's
legal order offers neither a justification
nor a norm of punishment. If a law is
violated, then so what? What justification
or criterion of punishment do you derive
from that? None, evidently. But behind
the legal order lies a normative order, a
universe of values, and that can offer a
justification as well as norms of
punishment, right or wrong, acceptable
or unacceptable. The 'ought' of the law
is merely the policeman's dictate, but
behind it lies an 'ought' of values which
can be weighed as a moral code to decide
what may and what may not society do
when that normative order is violated. For
if the normative order seeks legitimacy
to impose itself by sovereign force on the
ground that it is morally desirable; then
restoring it back to shape is the only
legitimate response to its disruption, that
is, to any act of crime. And the principles
that guide the means by which the
restoration is effected must be --- and must
be declared to be --- a part of that normative
order, and not something external to and
certainly not antithetical to the values of
that order. Justification of judicial
punishment and the norms thereof must
flow from this. Just as judicial response
to civil offences is to set right the wrong
done to the individual, judicial response
to crime then is to merely set right the
wrong done to society and its moral order.

It is perhaps necessary to clarify one
point here. The moral order that we have
set up as the object that the _criminal
justice system_ protects is not identical
with the dominant system of moral values
prevalent in that society. It shares
something with it but is not necessarily
identical with it. It is the system of norms
revealed by the law, which lays down the
contours of legitimate behaviour as
understood by the law. The actual social
reality, that is to say the socio-economic
order, as well as the moral world view
of that society, which again consists of
at least two elements, one, the system of
values widely held to be valid or desirable
by (different social groups within) society,
and two, the system of values that
supposedly represent the higher truth by
virtue of the dominant religious or political
world view of that society, may well differ
from the legal norms of legitimate
behaviour. Take caste, for instance. Caste
is a living part of actual Indian social
reality. In terms of its moral standing,
Hindu society views it from a partially
secularised but still essentially brahminical
position. In terms of higher
morality, it abhors the more extreme
practices of caste, but the attitude towards
caste as a whole has been vacillating
between a secular world view and one
that sees some hidden principle of a
righteous social order in it. The legal view
of caste is, however, uncompromisingly
secular. Untouchability and related caste-based
discriminating practices are very
serious offences in the eyes of the law,
the only discrimination legally allowed
being the protective discrimination of
reservations. Much the same can be said
about gender. The normative order of the
law is much more secular (though not
entirely so, as in the case of caste) than
social morality, and certainly very much
more so than actual social reality. Or take
the case of violence. Violence is very
much part of our lives. Morally, it is not
always regarded as wrong, especially
when it is retributive in character. Though,
at the level of higher morality, all of us
arc supposed to believe in non-violence
as a superior virtue. The law, for its part,
abhors all violence except only that which
is a direct act of defence of person or
property, which is much narrower than
the retributive violence sanctioned by
popular morality. The situation is somewhat
reversed when it comes to property.
Our economic class structure is highly
unequal, and popular morality is a mixture
of envious acceptance (even abject
reverence), and resentment (even hatred) of
the fact. Higher morality affects an ascetic
contempt for property. The law, however,
is a ruthless protector of all property rights.

One can go on. But the point is that
there is a clear normative order underlying
the law, whose protection is what the law
aims at. The normative order is not just
the set of rules of behaviour one deduces
from the law as present in the statute
book. It is a moral order, a civilisational
perspective of human social and material
relations that the law encodes. Legitimacy
of the law derives from this normative
order. It is of course contested and not
universal in the sense of being beyond
argument, though there may well be
elements of it that have achieved universal
acceptance. But it is not spurious merely
because the egalitarian or rights-giving
parts of it are (possibly) at variance with
the actual social order, or the dominant
aspects thereof. (Of course, if the whole
of the law were only a justification of
inequality and injustice, then there would
be no legitimacy at all but that is not the
kind of law we are talking about) This
view is at variance with one common
radical view of law and legal justice, that
where they appear to deservingly claim
legitimacy for their suppressive force,
they are only acting as a legitimating
ideology for (or enacting a hegemonic
practice of) the unequal social order. Such
a view, as said earlier, leaves no space
for any meaningful discussion of norms
of punishment; and more importantly, it
does not constitute an adequate understanding
of the history of normative
standards (whether of the law or morality)
which reflects a ceaseless human search
for norms of social behaviour, a search
that runs through the ups and downs of
exploitative and oppressive social systems
and revolutions and rebellions, constantly
accumulating new values, discarding or
revising old ones, generating a corpus
that can at any point of time be evaluated
from the viewpoint of equality and
freedom, and which has significance for
actual social struggle for equality and
freedom, and also for the possible shape
of the institutional mechanisms that may
help structure an egalitarian society.

If, then, it is accepted that what a _public
justice_ system does when it punishes
criminal offences is to act on behalf of
society to correct the harm done by the
offence to society's moral order (the
normative order of its law, to be precise),
then it is possible to think of how much
punitive violence justice may be legitimately
allowed. Obviously, it cannot be
allowed any greater self-righteousness in
responding to crime than the righteousness
of its normative order. In other words,
how harsh the law may be on offenders
must be limited by how just its normative
order is. No society known to us is so
perfect that it can demand the right of
harsh punishments, such as the _capital
punishment_, nor will there ever be. It may
be said that the criterion of 'justness' of
the moral order is vague and subjective.
But since inequality --- of status, opportunity,
endowment, respect, freedom,
consideration for individual peculiarities,
etc. --- is what alienates people from the
social order in which they live, and makes
them prone to violating its norms, the apt
criterion for justness here is the absence
(relatively speaking, of course) of such
inequality.

It will be immediately perceived that
there is a trap in this otherwise reasonable
argument: it seems to imply that the more
just the normative order of a society, the
more right it has to impose harsh punishments,
and therefore that a perfect society
may execute every criminal. This is, of
course, the logic with which communist-ruled
countries (irrespective of whether
they have actually been perfectly just
societies) have always justified their
illiberal justice systems. One answer to
this perverse interpretation is that the
argument is not meant to be used in the
converse direction. It is like the dictum
that only those who have never sinned
should hasten to throw stones at sinners,
which does not mean that the less one has
sinned, the more stones one may throw.
More positively, the norms of punishment
are not something external to the
normative order which the punishment
seeks to protect. They are part of it.
Therefore, a society which is otherwise
perfect but imposes harsh punishment on
transgressors of its norms would not meet
the criterion of a just society, for a
correctional attitude as against a retributive
or merely deterrent attitude of judicial
punishment is part of the justness --- in the
sense of equal consideration for the normal
and the aberrant --- of the normative order.

But that is not all we have said that
punishment as given by a _public justice_
system --- as distinguished from _private
revenge_ --- is aimed at restoration of the
moral order of society violated or disrupted
by the offence. But can judicial punishment
do all of it? Or is it properly to be
seen as only one of the mechanisms of
societal response to the disruption of its
moral order? Most of the arguments in
defence of harsh punishments, in particular
the _capital punishment_, assume that judicial
punishment is the total answer to crime.
But if judicial punishment is what we have
identified it to be, it can never be the total
answer to crime, and therefore it need
never be and can never be as harsh as the
crime, as cruel as the criminal. The usual
argument (a very popular argument in
defence of _capital punishment_) that there
is nothing wrong if the judicial response
to crime is cruel when the criminal is cruel,
places the offender and justice on par. This
is wrong for two reasons. One is that the
individual is seeking some private gain or
_retribution_ whereas justice is acting on
behalf of society to restore to shape the
normative order disrupted in that process
by the offender; it certainly does not seek
_retribution_, and _deterrence_, within limits,
is only one of the goals aimed by it in its
job: and secondly, the _criminal justice
system_ is not the whole of the answer to
crime. Society must act through its various
wings to effect the restoration of the order
disrupted, of which the institution of
punitive justice is only one (though a
necessary and legitimate one). Confronted
with an act of crime, society should
consider that it could have been occasioned
by three possibilities: a lack in the
normative order, a mismatch between the
normative order and the actual social conditions
or possible human asociability, or
a fault of the offender himself. Indeed,
usually the three are not easy to separate.
Societal response, a part of which is
structured through the _criminal justice
system_, must address all the three possible
facets of crime. It can never put all the
blame upon the individual's wilful and
perverse disobedience of the law and
reduce the whole of crime to the domain
of criminal justice; and answer cruelty
with cruelty, violence with violence. It is
this logic that results in the fervent
arguments heard whenever the _criminal
justice system_ fails to deter crime, that its
institutions and norms should be made
more stringent, given more 'teeth' (a rather
telling piece of canine imagery), etc. On
the contrary, societal response, while
including within its ambit a corrective and
(within limits) deterrent penal system,
should concentrate at least as much on a
self-critical look at itself, its actual
condition, its normative order, and the
position of human individuals and groups
within either of them. _Capital punishment_,
or any kind of harsh punishment not to
speak of tolerance of extra-judicial punishments
inflicted by the police or armed
forces, are ruled out because they put
excessive blame on the individual's --- or
the dissident group's --- perverse rejection
of the law, and moreover reduce criminal
justice to an answer _in kind_.

We live in times of severe social turmoil,
crisis and the ascendance of the extremely
illiberal politics of the Hindu fanatics. The
crisis and the turmoil provide them with
enough scope to legislate their illiberal
attitudes with unreflecting popular
sanction. Most people feel understandably
disturbed by the mindless bombings of
trains and buses in Coimbatore or Thrissur
and the equally mindless killing of Hindus
in Doda and Poonch; by the stories of rape
in Rajasthan and gangsterism in Bihar or
Uttar Pradesh. This mood has already
the Hindutva forces going: they have
blackmailed Karunanidhi (not that he is
an angel, but he had no need to be a devil)
into enacting an anti-terrorist law for the
state least affected by violence, and Advani
promises agitated protestors about rapes
in Rajasthan that this country will soon
hang rapists. He advises _naxalite_-affected
stales of south-central India to look upon
the _People's War_ as purely a problem of
crime, and draft repressive laws to the
dictation of the police. He will no doubt
be saying the same thing to Farooq
Abdullah, who is in any case ready to
crawl when he is only asked to curtsy. As
this mood catches on --- the communal
fanaticism and the general illiberality and
inhumanity of the Hindu fanatics is a mood
that goes well beyond the votes they get
 --- we are going to find courts silently
handing out more and more harsh punishments,
bending backward to look at
evidence from the policeman's point of
view (one comment frequently made about
the Rajiv Gandhi case judgment is that it
is the charge-sheet suitably rewritten to
look like a judgment), and sending more
and more people to the hangman. At the
end what we are going to have is not a
solution to any of the social or political
problems underlying this degeneration but
only a more harsh and inhuman _criminal
justice system_'. Today's debate about the
_capital punishment_ must be seen in this
context.
