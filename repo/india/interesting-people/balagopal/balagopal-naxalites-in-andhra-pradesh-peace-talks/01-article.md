_The government of Andhra Pradesh says it continues to be open to
talks with the Naxalites and that it is the latter who have broken off
negotiations. What the government does not say is that the
Naxalites broke off talks only after it became clear that the
government had no intention of stopping the killing of their cadre.
To this extent the Naxalites' decision to leave the table cannot be
faulted and the principal responsibility for restarting the
process would lie with the government. But the revolutionaries
have an equal responsibility, namely, to ensure that the unreal
tone and the drama of the first round is eschewed and the two
sides conduct themselves with the degree of realism one supposes
they are capable of._

\ 

It began as a tenacious essay in political
realism, entered a phase of sheer drama
unbelievable in its unreality, and ended
in the bitter rattle of gun-fire.

The reference is to the 'talks' between
Y S Rajasekhara Reddy's government in
Andhra Pradesh and the _Naxalites_. To be
fair to the devil --- Rajasekhara Reddy never
really believed in the talks and never joined
the effort --- nor the theatre that was enacted
in Hyderabad for about a week. That is
about the only good thing one can say
about his conduct in the matter: he was
consistent in his indifferences to the process.
He is by nature incapable of tolerating
any situation in which he has to share
the stage with others, and as a matter of
political tradition irremediably deficient
in the capacity to thrash out differences
in a dialogue. He has always preferred
more conclusive alternatives.

His home minister was, on the
government's side, the author of much of
the effort and much of the drama too. Jana
Reddy embodies a certain earthiness that
is the most charming quality of a backward
peasantry. He is no peasant, and he has
seen too much politics to be anybody's
fool, but he has chosen to don the guise
of a guileless peasant from just the kind
of place he hails from: the barren lands of
Nalgonda. He probably has his reason. His
constituency, the only one he can ever win
from, is overrun by the _Krishnapatti dalam_
of the _Maoists_.[^1] He knows them, their strength,
their weaknesses and their staying power.
He knows that whatever else may vanquish
them, bluster will not. Chandrababu
Naidu tried it, and nearly got killed.

[^1]: It is, in parenthesis, nice at last to be able to
call the _Maoists_ by their proper name. One
remembers that there was some theological
objection of Chinese origin to the use of the
expression _Maoism_; it was said that one should
only say _Mao Zedong Thought_. The objection
seems to have demised on its own.

But if Rajasekhara Reddy (let us call
him _YSR_ hereafter) did not join the effort
after becoming chief minister, he was
complicit with it in its origins in the preelection
campaign. Having been out of
power for about nine years, Congressmen
were expected in any case to promise many
things. But what added a certain seriousness
to their promises this time round was
that most of them were thrown up in the
course of the _padayatra_ _YSR_ undertook
before the polls. He walked around the
state, meeting people in the streets and
hamlets, listening to their grievances and
making promises. In Telangana, he heard
many complaints about police lawlessness.
It is characteristic of the man that
even in that most expansive pre-election
mood the one thing he took care not to
promise was relief from police harassment
in case his party came to power. A former
radical student turned Congressman who
suggested such a promise in the course of
_YSR_'s meeting with the people in a
Karimnagar village was told in so many
words to _mind his business_.

But what _YSR_ did promise was that his
government would initiate talks with the
_Naxalites_ to 'solve the long-standing
problem'. Since there is no particular
'problem' that the _Naxalites_ are agitating
about, he was probably referring to the
_Naxalites_ themselves as the problem of
long standing. Or probably he was not
very clear what he was saying. When even
more intelligent persons than _YSR_ have
shown themselves capable of woolly thinking
in the matter, one may not expect
perfect clarity from a chief minister-probable
on a pre-election _padayatra_.

Getting elected was a very pleasant shock
for Congressmen. It is not given to human
beings to be dishonest with their innermost
selves, and so they must have known
that nothing they had ever done had entitled
them to this. It was what Chandrababu had
done and not done that had given them
the bonus. A certain humility is natural in
such circumstances and so to begin with,
steps were taken on various fronts to implement
some of the promises. The talks with
the _Naxalites_ was the most high-profile of
them. The ban in force from 1992 against
the _CPI(M-L) (_Peoples War_)_ as the party
was called until September 2004) was
lifted, and cessation of police operations
against the _Naxalites_ was announced in
June 2004. The principal _Naxalite_ parties,
especially the _Peoples War_, reciprocated
by ceasing violence against instruments
and partisans of the establishment. For a
full six months there was practically no
killing in police-_Naxalite_ war, which is a
record for the last decade and a half at
least. The people living in the main areas
of conflict had a taste of what they had
long forgotten: life reasonably free of fear.

A more detailed _code of conduct_ for the
period of the talks needed to be agreed about
before the dialogue could start. Would the
police continue their search for underground
cadre, and if so by what kind of means?
Would they take lawful measures against
armed cadre, such as, for instance, arresting
them and seizing their weapons, or would
the _Naxalites_ have the run of the state?
On their part, would the _Naxalites_ indulge
in violent forms of protest such as the burning
of buses and blowing up of government
buildings, and would they use force as an
instrument of struggle, for instance, in land
occupation? Or would they confine themselves
to lawful means of agitation during
the period of the talks? It would obviously
be difficult to get the dialogue going without
some agreement on these matters.

# Need for Agenda

An agenda for the talks too needed to
be agreed on, if possible. The _Peoples War_
and the _CPI(M-L) (Jana Shakthi)_ announced
a team of representatives to talk
to the government about the _code of conduct_
(which came to be called the _ceasefire
agreement_, though many in government
claimed to be uncomfortable with the notion
of a _ceasefire_, which in their understanding
could apply only to two sovereign
armies and not between a legitimate force
and an illegitimate rebel group). The
_Peoples War_ was the party that was mainly
targeted for the talks for the obvious reason
that it is far and away the strongest
of the _Naxalite_ groups. The _CPI(M-L) (Jana
Shakthi)_ got tagged along apparently
because they were working together with
the _Peoples War_ on many issues. The other
armed Communist revolutionary groups ---
there are at least five more which can claim
varying degrees of armed efficacy and
popular support --- were not sure whether
they were invited, though some of them
expressed willingness to join the talks if
invited. At least two, the _CPI(M-L) (New
Democracy)_ and _CPI(M-L) (Unity Initiative)_,
whose activity tends to be predominantly
peaceful, showed no interest since
they --- probably rightly --- saw the talks as
a matter between the state and the more
violently inclined _Naxalite_ groups.

Interestingly, while sympathisers of the
_Naxalite_ movement outside Andhra
Pradesh have been heard to express doubts
about the desirability of the talks, practically
no one in the radical Left camp in
the state saw the talks in themselves as
undesirable. Left to themselves, the normal
reaction of the average radical intellectual
or activist in the state would have
been to ridicule the notion of the talks, and
indeed one prominent writer who is generally
left to herself did ridicule the process,
but the rest sensed that there was a strong
current of public opinion cutting across
class and region favouring some kind of
dialogue between the revolutionaries and
the state, and sensibly bowed to it.

It was realised by the two sides that talks
require mediation, and so a committee of
mediators was agreed upon. In this as in
much of the first round of the talks the
_Naxalites_ practically had their way: the
mediators were essentially their choice. In
the heady months of June-October 2004
there was an air of the return of the prodigal
child in all official response to the _Naxalites_.
The only thing missing was the fatted calf.
This strange pampering, which the uncommonly
benign air the home minister perfectly,
sported, was merely one moment
of the unreality of those days. The mediators
and the representatives of the _Naxalites_
discussed the matter of the _code of conduct_
with the government and a draft of the
terms of _ceasefire_ took shape by the end
of July. The _ceasefire agreement_ had eight
clauses in it. All of them amounted to only
one thing: that the two sides would, for
the duration of the talks, refrain from the
acts of violence that had permeated revolution
and counter-revolution during the
last decade. _Clause 1_ committed the two
sides to non-use of firearms and any and
every means of destruction of life. _Clauses
2, 3 and 6_ set out the various acts of
violence the _Peoples War_ has habitually
been indulging in, in the course of its fight
against the State, and committed that party
to abjure the lot for the duration of the
talks. _Clauses 4, 5 and 8_ similarly listed
the repressive acts the police have been
habitually committing in the course of
their counter-insurgency operations and
committed them to abjuring the lot too.

# _Clause 7_

That leaves out _Clause 7_, which has
become historic in a manner of speaking.
The issue this clause addressed was whether
the _Naxalites_ would go around sporting
weapons in public view during the period
of talks. From the beginning it was clear
to all (or so we thought) what unlike the
previous dispensation of Chandrababu
Naidu, this government would not insist,
as a pre-condition to the talks, that the
_Naxalites_ put down their weapons, that is
to say give up armed struggle altogether.
The issue for the _code of conduct_ was only
this: during the period of talks, when the
_Naxalites_ were free to move around spreading
their political message of revolution,
and organising people on issues, would
they keep their firearms in some hideout,
or go around with the guns slinging from
their shoulders? The government insisted
that they do not move around with weapons.
_Clause 7_ as proposed read: "During the
period of talks the _Peoples War_ as well as
other political parties will be free to undertake
propagation of their politics without
carrying weapons, in a manner that will
preserve the atmosphere of peace". The
wording was somewhat elliptic but the
intent was clear.

# Hazy Controversy

There has been some hazy controversy
regarding the incorporation of and assent
to this clause, with trading of charges of
bad faith on both sides. The fact perhaps
is that it was initially not seen by the
revolutionaries as involving any major
compromise, but they had second thoughts
later. In fact, their first response was the
right one, but soon rhetoric took over and
there could be no going back thereafter.
It is obvious that while a government
working under a rule of law regime can
in public interest very well open talks with
armed groups that reject its law without
making it a precondition that they give up
armed struggle, it cannot assure them that
they can freely move around with weapons
and the police will look the other way. It
is no answer to this to say that a lot of ruling
party men have unlicensed weapons and
the police _do_ look the other way when they
take them out. They do, but the point is
that the State cannot and does not on paper
commit itself to such licence. Perhaps, if
the revolutionaries --- or rather, their intellectual
sympathisers, who can never have
enough of blood and gore --- had not taken
off at a tangent and messed up the matter
with uncalled for rhetoric, _Clause 7_ could
have been approved as proposed by the
government, with an unwritten understanding
that in areas where the revolutionaries
faced danger from _renegades_ or other
criminal _counter-insurgents_, they could
carry unostentatious weapons of defence,
and the police would not interfere.

But any such possibility was foreclosed
by radical ideologues of various kinds who
quickly got into the act. It was said that
the people had a right to carry weapons
so long as the State in the form of its police
and armed forces did, and any view to the
contrary was an ideological surrender to
the hegemony of law as an instrument of
the State. More earthily, it was said that
the oppressed people could no more be
asked to abjure weapons than cattle could be
asked to give up their horns, or tigers their
claws (if claws are what tigers have). Along
a different ideological trajectory, it was said
that when the gods of brahminical Hinduism
were all armed to the teeth, the _dalit-bahujan_
masses had every right to arm themselves.
Radical theories of political violence had a
field day, as they would, since Andhra Pradesh
is unfortunately full of pen-pushers whose
capacity to withstand the reality of a violent
conflict is untested but are fascinated
by violence in ink.

Any one hearing the discussion would
have thought that the very justification of
armed struggle was in question, and that
the government was going back to
Chandrababu Naidu's position: that the
government will talk to the revolutionaries
only if they give up armed struggle. By and
by _YSR_ would start saying that, but that
was not the issue when disagreement
initially cropped up concerning _Clause 7_
of the _ceasefire agreement_. Indeed the way
that innocuous term of the _ceasefire agreement_
was made to look like total surrender
of weapons for good and all not only
physically, but ideologically as well, has
resulted in an obfuscation of the issue that
has enabled _YSR_ now to talk of total
disarming as a pre-condition for talks and
yet give the impression that he is insisting
only on having his way with _Clause 7_.

At that time, however, the strong public
mood in favour of talks saved the situation.
It was suggested by well-wishers of the
talks, and accepted by both sides, that the
disagreement over _Clause 7_ would not be
allowed to become an obstacle to the talks.
The rest of the _ceasefire agreement_ would
be finalised and talks initiated, with the
controversial clause itself being an item on
the agenda of the talks. This, of course,
put the revolutionaries in a happy position,
for until the time there was some agreement
on _Clause 7_, they would go around the
countryside with weapons, notwithstanding
the ceasefire and the dialogue. That the
government knowingly countenanced this
is of a piece with the _prodigal child syndrome_
referred to above. Or perhaps it was
the _long rope syndrome_: it is a little difficult
to be certain. For soon the press started
publishing news --- with telling photographs
--- of armed squads of the _Peoples War_ and
_Janashakthi_ going around villages, holding
meetings, occupying lands, issuing
warnings and threats to persons accused
of harassing or cheating the people or
informing the police about the movements
of the revolutionaries, ordering externment
of some of them from villages, and so on.
While this state of affairs caused understandable
disquiet in more than one quarter,
the police started expressing disquiet
about collection of large amounts of money
by the revolutionaries 'taking advantage
of the freedom given to them'. There is
no evidence that even the worst kind of
repression had ever diminished the
capacity of the revolutionaries to collect
such money as they wanted, and at will
at that, and the police know this better than
any one. That nevertheless they chose to
make a big issue of it is probably because
they thought they could use it to disturb
the popular mood which had turned very
friendly towards the revolutionaries. The
most attractive thing about revolution is
its deep moral tone, and extortion ill
becomes it. But there could be another
reason: the police in general --- and this
has nothing to do with the presence or
absence of militancy in the area --- tolerate
extortion the least among all offences; in
fact, it enrages them, because they dislike
competition. There are no greater organised
extortionists than the police, and they
do not like anybody cutting into their
business.

But popular mood remained friendly, in
fact hugely so, and the talks did start.
Nobody had any notion what the agenda
could be. Many among the public seem to
have thought that the ultimate agenda was
the establishment of peace, which can only
mean that armed struggle would be given
up by the revolutionaries. In tune with this,
the talks were frequently described as
'peace talks'. This expectation, which had
no basis in any fact, is probably one reason
for the enthusiastic reception the talks got
from quarters normally quite unfriendly
towards any suggestion of a civilised
response to the _Naxalites_. Equally surprising
is the belief entertained by many otherwise
intelligent persons, including some
known as competent social analysts, that
the government and the revolutionaries
would sit across the table and discuss how
best to solve the problems of poverty,
untouchability, dowry, drought and so on.
They should have known that no government
sanctified as lawfully elected will
accord that degree of respect to an armed
group that is a law unto itself, unless the
group is either ready to lay down arms if
some policy changes are agreed upon, or
has reached a degree of strength that makes
normal governance impossible. That the
_Naxalites_ are in no mood to disarm themselves
is a well known fact. And it can be
nobody's case that they have the kind of
strength that makes normal governance
impossible in Andhra Pradesh. That they
are capable of causing substantial degree
of inconvenience to the administration in
its routine functioning in the areas of their
strength and influence is true. But by no
stretch of imagination can it be said that
administration has been crippled to a degree
that it makes it impossible for the
government of the state to function without
letting the revolutionaries into the
privilege of policy-making, even as they
are free in the interregnum between one
round of the talks and the next, and permanently
thereafter, to carry on armed
revolution. This should have been obvious
but was apparently thought irrelevant by
many quite intelligent persons. The amount
of wool that flew around Hyderabad in
those heady weeks could have clothed a
sizeable Arctic expedition.

# _Give and Take_

In the realm of practical politics, dialogue
can only be on the basis of _give and
take_, unless one side has made life truly
impossible for the other. One area where
_give and take_ was possible was in the
matter of the forms of violence and counter-violence
that the two sides have developed
over the years. The police could agree to
stop torturing the kith and kin of a militant
to reveal his/her whereabouts, or to put
pressure upon the family to make the
militant surrender. They could agree to see
provision of food or shelter to militants as
a matter of political sympathy or social
empathy and not a crime. They could agree
therefore not to harass people who do so.
They could agree not to see the encouragement
of the _Naxalites_ behind every
protest movement in the areas of their
activity, nor to construe such encouragement,
if true --- as in itself criminal --- so long
as the grievance is just. They could agree
not to obstruct any social or economic
benefit obtained by the people with the
help or assistance of _Naxalite_ activity. In
plain terms, to agree not to punish political
and social activism in the name of _preventing
violence_. This would be a difficult
decision to take, but it would have to be
taken. It would be objected to on the ground
that the seemingly just activism creatures
a popular base for revolutionary violence,
and therefore, the police are entitled to take
preventive steps. The apprehension is not
without factual basis, but the conclusion
inferred is of the same genus as George
Bush's theory of the _right of violent preemption_,
and no more acceptable. The
State must agree not to suppress political
aspirations and their peaceful expression
in the name of the revolution that lurks
behind it, even if we all know that it does.
The police should also agree not to kill a
person taken into custody, nor hunt down
militants and shoot them while eating,
sleeping or bathing in a mountain stream
as if they are wild game. And not to corrupt
militants and create covert operatives inside
the revolutionary ranks.

The _Naxalites_ on their part could agree
not to harm any and every leader of the
ruling party, however small or inconsequential,
in retaliation to the State's repressive
policies. That any and every
policeman would not be killed in retaliation
to 'encounters'. That the routine
political-administrative activity of the
establishment would not be forcibly prevented.
That elections and election campaigns
would be allowed unhindered and
the people's freedom to choose to be
followers of the Congress, _Telugu Desam
Party (TDP)_ or _BJP_ would not be curtailed. It
would be objected to on the ground that
as we all know --- these parties tell lies and
cheat the people --- and allowing people to
freely follow them would tantamount to
allowing the people in their innocence to
offer themselves to the cheating. This
objection too is not without basis, but
nevertheless the revolutionaries must agree
not to obstruct the freedom --- for truth can
be realised only in freedom --- though they
will, of course, be free to expose the lies
and the cheating. The revolutionaries
should also agree to be transparent in the
allegations they make about persons being
police informers, anti-people elements, etc.,
and fair in their modes of proof, before
setting out to punish them. And mindful
of the person's social-economic background
in deciding the punishment to be
given. Indeed, this is perhaps the single
most important demand that the people at
large would place upon them.

# Distribution of Fallow Land

The amount of violence the two sides
have subjected to each other is such that
the mutuality implied by such an agreement
would be attractive to both. And the
people living in the affected areas would
be immeasurably happy with it. It could,
therefore, be a fruitful agenda for the talks.
Some other issues could also be added to
it, without transgressing the limits of plain
realism. There are some thousands of acres
of land lying fallow, mostly in the districts
of Warangal, Karimnagar and Adilabad,
which were occupied forcibly by the revolutionaries.
They intended that the poor
should cultivate it but the police would not
allow that. With the original landholder
scared of the _Naxalites_ and the poor scared
of the police, the land remains fallow.
There could be some agreement beneficial
to the poor about the disposal of the land.
Not all the original landholders were landlords.
Some were merely political enemies
of the _Naxalites_ or their cadre, and
otherwise ordinary farmers. In any case
even in those instances where the original
landholder was a landlord, it is doubtful
that the land implanted with red flags would
be legally acquirable surplus land. Yet,
most of the landowners have long since
expressed willingness to give up the land
if they are allowed to retain enough for
their needs, or paid some compensation.
There was one instance in Nalgonda district
where a large extent of semi-cultivable
land overlain with intractable litigation
was distributed to the deserving among
the claimants at the instance the _Peoples
War_ and the then home minister. The
remaining litigants were successfully persuaded
not to take the matter to court: such
persuasion is essential since property in
land is constitutionally protected from
acquisition other than in accordance with
the law. Some such arrangement could
probably be worked out in the matter of
all the fallow land. This too would be of
advantage to both because there is much
public resentment at the sight of arable
land of substantial extent lying fallow.

There is another important matter that
both sides could fruitfully come to an
agreement on. This is the mutual obstruction
of political freedom. Whether legally
banned or not, the _Naxalite_ parties and
their mass organisations face tremendous
obstruction from the police. They are not
permitted to hold meetings, distribute
pamphlets, stage cultural programmes, etc.
For offences of violence committed by the
underground, the activists of the mass
organisations suffer terrible police retaliation.
They have not infrequently been
killed as surrogates for the underground.
In turn, they --- especially the _CPI (Maoist)_
as the _Peoples War_ is now called --- have
made life quite miserable for the local
cadre and leaders of the _TDP_ and Congress
(indeed all the parliamentary parties) in the
areas of their influence. Election time can
be pretty bad, but even normal times are
not altogether safe for them. The elected
representatives in the local bodies are
especially vulnerable. They can be killed,
maimed, their property set on fire, the
lands planted with red flags, etc, for no
greater reason than that they represent the
repressive regime at Hyderabad. The
_Maoists_, at any rate, have never made a
secret of the logic of retaliation: when
these parties, in power or in opposition,
deny us out political freedom, why should
we respect theirs? It is precisely because
of their logic that a fruitful agreement that
will permit both sides to exercise their
political freedom --- from participation in
polls to publication of pamphlets --- would
be of value to both. We have already seen
the likely objection --- especially from the
police --- that political freedom for the
revolutionary point of view will tend to
increase revolutionary violence. If revolutionary
violence _is_ found attractive by
significant numbers of the people, and _will_
grow at the first opportunity, then that
says something about the existing state
of affairs, and whatever any one may
think about such a state of affairs, shutting
it out forcibly from society's sight is no
response.

This far the dialogue could reasonably
have gone. Since an extended ceasefire
with armed rebels is unlikely to be acceptable
to any government in the absence of
the disarming of the rebels on the agenda
of the talks, the proper thing would have
been to fix a brief agenda as outlined
above, get down to the nuts and bolts of
it, and conclude it as fast as possible.
Indeed, if the dialogue had been understood
as a brief and pointed matter, the
'controversial _Clause 7_' could have been
simply ignored.

# Resemblance to Theatre

But that is not what happened. The closer
the situation came to the actual beginning
of talks, the more unreal it became. The
government never spelt out any agenda,
and the revolutionaries, for their part, seem
to have thought of it as some sort of a
public debate between ruling class politics
and revolutionary politics. Indeed, a large
number of their followers too appear to
have thought so, and were quite happy
about it, for if it was to be a debate, it was
a foregone conclusion which side would
win. There was, for instance, a proposal
that the talks should take place by turns
at Hyderabad, and three towns in the three
regions of Andhra, Telangana and
Rayalaseema. The resemblance to theatre
is unmistakable. The resemblance survived
the prologue and extended to the first Act
too. When the time came for the revolutionary
delegation to emerge from the
underground for the talks, the delegation
of five (at least two of whom are known
mostly to live in Hyderabad) went from
their normal places of activity to the
Nallamalai forests, and then emerged in
the full glare of television cameras. They
could well have left their weapons somewhere
and come down to Hyderabad, if
they were not already there. Instead they
came out of the forests weapons in hand,
followed by their comrades to whom they
then handed over their weapons. Turning
their backs on the jungle they walked
weaponless into the 'mainstream' as their
comrades disappeared into the forests, arms
and all, camera bulbs flashing furiously.

At Hyderabad, the government put them
up at one of its guest houses, arranged
police security, and let them interact freely
with the public. The media and public
attention they received was stupendous.
Any unsuspecting stranger walking into
Hyderabad in those days could well have
thought that they were leaders of a victorious
rebel army, come to receive the sceptre
and the crown at the defeated capital. The
chief minister vanished from the TV screen,
and it was the revolutionaries all the way.
Delegation upon delegation from different
walks of life, political persuasions and
ideological inclinations called upon them.
Problems of various sections of society
were taken to them and they were asked
to raise them with the government in the
course of the talks. Even prominent
_Ambedkarites_ who had on more than one
occasion accused the revolutionaries of
not comprehending caste and not fighting
for its annihilation for the reason that their
leadership at the top is upper caste, attended
the durbar of the revolutionary delegation,
whose main spokesman Akkiraju
Haragopal also known as Ramakrishna
was a brahmin by birth, to suggest an
agenda for the talks that would take in the
components of social revolution.

# Disquieting Phenomenon

Forgetting the ideologues, in the minds
of the literally hundreds of ordinary people
and activists who thronged the Manjira
Guest House, there was this assumption,
perhaps, that the government had called
the revolutionaries to Hyderabad to discuss
intractable social issues and people's
problems with them, and so it made sense
to add their problems to the agenda. It did
not occur to any one to ask themselves why
the government would want the advice of
the revolutionaries, for it is nobody's case
that the government does not solve people's
problems because it is not aware of them,
nor that it has no in-house experts in its
Secretariat who can advise it as well. Nor
did any one ask themselves why all problems
of society should be discussed with
the _Maoists_, whose programmatic concern
and certainly their comprehension had
always been confined to only a few. Perhaps
the less innocent assumption was that the
government would sense the threat of
violence behind the issues raised for
discussion by the revolutionaries, and resolve
them in the manner suggested by
them. Indeed, thus undercurrent of faith
in the efficacy of the gun over persuasion
or democratic pressure was the most disquieting
thing about the otherwise quite
charming adulation the revolutionaries
received in those few days. Most of those
who visited them --- delegations of the
physically disabled, _adivasis_, hutment
dwellers, etc --- certainly knew much more
about the issues they had been fighting
than the revolutionaries did, and they knew
that the government had never deigned to
send any delegation other than the police
to answer their agitation. In normal circumstances,
any suggestion that the government
discusses their issues with some
other party or organisation would have
given rise to understandable resentment at
the usurpation of their agenda, but now
they themselves voluntarily invited the
usurpation. It is not that overnight they had
acquired faith in _Maoism_. They were merely
expressing the cynical faith that lurks under
the democratic skin, that the gun is a more
effective political weapon than any devised
by democracy.

The revolutionaries rose to the dramatic
occasion and promised to talk of everything
with the government - land, caste,
gender, the World Bank, globalisation,
minority rights, etc. To what effect, no one
knew. And no one asked, for it was a grand
show that no one wanted to spoil. And to
give them their due the revolutionaries
handled their role with poise and dignity.
They avoided the usual radical habit of
construing all dialogue as an exercise in
putting the interlocutor in his/her place.
They of course made it a point to tell
people that the solution to all problems lay
in their leadership. They meant their political
leadership but those who had come
to them had already accepted that at a more
cynical level.

And on this note the talks started. Some
one should have taken things in hand at
this stage, made the two sides see sense,
and pared down the agenda to the politically
feasible. And saw to it that the talks
would be a quiet face-to-face affair with
no more than two or three on either side,
give or take a mediator. That is how all
serious dialogue between governments and
rebels takes place anywhere in the world.
But not in Hyderabad. In retrospect one
wonders whether both the radicals and
the government were not laughing up
their sleeves. On the government's side,
to declare an agenda would be to give
legitimacy to the notion that there was
something the government should discuss
with the revolutionaries. To just sit across
the table and listen to them hector the
establishment without committing itself to
anything in particular would belong to the
genre of humouring the prodigals, and that
the government had no objection to doing.
The revolutionaries, for their part, even as
they were talking to the government, were
in fact addressing the public behind it. For
about a decade if not more, they were
known to the public outside their areas of
activity through news of death --- death at
their hands or their death. Intelligent persons
would often pose the question whether
there was nothing more to revolution than
killing and getting killed. Now the revolutionaries
had a good chance to tell the
public that they cared for a wide range of
issues of justice. Intentionally or otherwise
the revolutionaries utilised the first round
of talks to address the public and answer
the questions often flung at them. In this
they succeeded. They also held a series of
well attended public meetings at various
corners of the State, spreading the more
usual kind of fire and brimstone message
and giving heart to their followers who had
grown tired over the years of talking of
nothing but police repression.

The only concrete decision that came out
of the first round of talks that were held
from October 15 to 18, 2004 was that a
commission of sorts would be constituted
to go into the question of distributing land
to the landless. The _Peoples War_ which
had in the meanwhile become the _CPI
(Maoist)_ after merging with the MCC[^mcc] of
Bihar, insisted that the commission should
not consist only of government officials
but should also include persons with a
history of involvement in agitation of land
to the poor. The government agreed, but
nothing was put on paper, and soon enough
the government forgot about it. It was said
that the second round of talks would take
place by and by but neither a date nor any
more concrete agenda than in the first
round was agreed upon.

At that time, it was generally expected
that there would be a second round, though
any one with any political intelligence must
have realised that the government could
not go on playing the benign host for ever.
The ceasefire was effectively used by the
_Maoists_ and all the revolutionaries to reenter
areas that they had practically vacated
for quite a few years. With '_Clause 7_'
undecided, they were going about
with weapons, planting red flags in lands,
issuing orders to all and sundry, holding
public meetings disseminating the idea of
armed struggle. And they had from the
beginning made it clear that there would
be no surrender of arms and abandonment
of armed struggle at the end of the talks.
Any indefinite continuation of this state of
affairs would evidently be unacceptable to
the government. It would, quite likely,
insist on more purposeful talks in the second
round, namely, some bargain that would
make life easier for its rural representatives
and administrators while conceding something
by way of freedom and relaxation
of repression in return. This is what was
generally expected.

But then _YSR_ spoke out. He had maintained
a strange silence all through, as had
his _Director General of Police_ (_DGP_), except
for an angry outburst or two. The government
had throughout been represented by
the home minister and a _Director General
(Intelligence)_. Now _YSR_ started speaking
as if he had been asleep all these days and
had suddenly woken up. Where is the
question of talking about people's problems
with the _Naxalites_, he asked. He
would talk to them about the modalities
of their surrender, if they wished. And of
course there would be no toleration of
armed men and women moving around.
The police would have to act. The _DGP_,
taking the cue, expressed the point of view
of perhaps the majority of the policemen.
Namely, any talks other than for the final
surrender of the revolutionaries would only
strengthen revolution. If governance had
consisted of nothing but policing, this is
of course a perfectly sensible view. And
indeed it was the view that prevailed with
Chandrababu Naidu's government. But the
whole point in seeking a different approach
from the government was that
revolution being a socio-political process,
looking at it exclusively from the point of
its containment made no sense even to the
rulers, let alone the ruled. If there is an
armed revolution going on and if it has
proved its staying power, it makes little
sense even for the purpose of administration
to think exclusively in terms of its
containment and extermination. A time
comes when in the interests of the people,
those goals would have to be postponed
and governance learns at least in the short
run to live with the revolution on terms
least injurious to the people involved in
the matter. This would be all the more so
when the nature of the revolution is such
that the people involved in the whole
process are the weakest, the poorest and
the most vulnerable in society.

But of course there was little possibility
of _YSR_ seeing things this way. The only hope
for the talks lay in his continued noninvolvement
in the process. And so the
moment he opened his mouth about it, all
possibility of a second round came to an end.
At about the same time the then _DGP_, an
officer who at least had some field experience
in Telangana in an earlier stage of
his career, retired and was replaced by an
officer who is a stranger to Naxalism as a
social process, and fancies himself a tough
cop to boot. There was a fortuitous circumstance
that, it was hoped, would ensure a less
disastrous choice for the post. Namely,
that this officer's wife is one of the principal
accused in a major criminal prosecution
for forgery and fabrication of documents
in aid of trafficking in little children in the
name of giving abandoned children in
adoption to well-heeled foreigners. It was
hoped that his appointment would for
that reason be seen as improper. But it
was not, and not many thought it should
have been.

# Tough Talk

The tough cop started talking tough and
the police started killing. The ceasefire,
that is to say the mutual agreement not to
kill, had stood quite firm for fully six
months by the end of 2004. There were
two or three incidents, in Mahbubnagar,
Cuddapah and Karimnagar districts, where
the _Maoist_ cadre violated the agreement
but those were clearly local aberrations
and not wilful reneging on the agreement
on that party's part. The police for their
part had desisted from killing, though they
continued to do the rest of the nasty things
that have become part of policing. But on
December 16, when the ceasefire was due
to be extended, the state cabinet met but
said nothing. It neither extended the ceasefire
nor did it declare that there would be
no further extension. Some ministers pretended
that they were not aware of any
_ceasefire agreement_, and some said that no
statement was needed to extend it since it
was an informal agreement. Hypocritical
noises were however made about continuing
the talks with the _Naxalites_, without
getting down to anything specific, and
without in plain terms extending the cessation
of killing. Indeed, the chief minister,
ever since he broke his silence in the
matter, has consistently talked in a manner
calculated to knock down the very basic
of the talks by saying that the _Naxalites_
would have to give up arms as a precondition.
He has never made it clear
whether he is only emphasising _Clause 7_
or going back to Chandrababu Naidu's
stand. While this ambiguity was made
possible by the revolutionaries themselves
when they talked of _Clause 7_ as if it was
a pre-condition of abandonment of armed
struggle altogether, he is in all likelihood
reverting to Chandrababu Naidu's point of
view, and would have done so even if
radical rhetoric had not created the needless
confusion. Only, his reneging on the
very basis of the talks would then have
been clear to the public.

# Aggressive Police

Once the signal was given from above,
the police became quite aggressive. They
have started going quite deep into the forests
to hunt and kill the armed cadre of the
_Naxalites_, in particular the _CPI (Maoist)_
cadre. For many years now they have been
regularly getting a lot of information about
the movements of the armed squads, a fact
that reflects the increasing organisational
brittleness of the _Naxalites_ from about the
mid-1990s, and so if they decide to hunt
and kill, it is a matter of time before they
start hitting the target. When the first
incident or two happened, there was possibility
of giving the benefit of doubt to
the government, namely, that the police
had taken things in hand without the consent
of the government. But _YSR_ did not leave
any doubt in any one's mind. He publicly
defended the killings, saying that so long
as the _Naxalites_ were armed, there would
be "encounters", and there was no need of
any enquiry because the police --- he somehow
knew --- had acted out of lawful necessity.
Once it became clear that the action
of the police had the sanction of the
government, the _Naxalites_ declared that
they were withdrawing from the talks, and
they too have started killing. About 60
lives were lost in the first two months of
this year, and things are therefore definitely
back to normal.

On the possibility of resuming the talks,
_YSR_ and his cabinet colleagues have been
indulging in the most reprehensible double-talk,
which appears to have been taken at
face value outside this state. The government
continues to be open to talks, they
say, and it is the _Naxalites_ who have broken
off. What they do not add is that the
_Naxalites_ broke off only after it became
clear that the government had no intention
of stopping the killing of their cadre. And
after _YSR_ reneged on the basic point which
the government had accepted at the very
beginning of the whole process, namely,
that _Naxalites_ giving up armed struggle
would not be a pre-condition for the talks.
To this extent their decision to leave the
dialogue table cannot be faulted and the
principal responsibility for restarting the
process would lie with the government.
But an equal responsibility lies on the revolutionaries
too, namely, to ensure that the
unreal tone and the drama of the first round
is eschewed, and the two sides conduct
themselves with the degree of realism one
supposes they are capable of.
