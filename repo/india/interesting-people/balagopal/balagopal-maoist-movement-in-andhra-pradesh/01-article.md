_In a situation marked by severe state repression of the Maoist
movement in Andhra Pradesh, violent retaliation by the
Maoists, and the state's brutal counter-attack (led by
the greyhounds) to gain the upper hand, the Maoists are
finding it difficult to retain the support of the next generation
of the most oppressed. State-encouraged gangs --- calling
themselves tigers and cobras --- have unleashed private vengeance,
which has played a major role in immobilising the substantial
over-ground support of the movement. But above all is the
tragic loss of the lives of organic leaders from among
the most oppressed._

\ 

Birpur, near the Godavari river in
the northern corner of Karimnagar
district, is the native village of
Muppalla Lakshmana Rao, better known
as Ganapathi, the general secretary of the
central committee of the _Communist Party
of India_ (_Maoist_). Before a road-building
mania took over the state in the regime of
Chandrababu Naidu, it was a village difficult
to access. Today it is accessible by
a black-top road from the temple town of
Dharmapuri on the incompletely laid out
National Highway No16 from Nizamabad
in Telangana to Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh.
As you approach Birpur from Dharmapuri,
you see at the entrance of the village a fresh
white memorial with two pigeons atop,
evidently intended to symbolise peace. The
white colour of the memorial and the
pigeons on top are in contrast to the hundreds
of red memorials with the hammer and
sickle on top that are strewn all over
Telangana. It was built recently by the
police to signify what the police gleefully
regard as their decisive achievement in
gaining an upper hand over the _Maoists_
in their major stronghold, the Godavari
river basin of northern Telangana. That it
was built in the village of the top _Maoist_
leader and inaugurated by the most unlikely
symbol of peace, the superintendent of
police, Karimnagar, is a juvenile gesture that
could have easily seemed merely tasteless
in a different context, but in fact symbolises
a disquieting fact: the politically juvenile
attitude of successive governments in
Andhra Pradesh towards the _Naxalites_.

Peace per se would be desired by many
people in the area. But very few are gleeful
that the _Maoists_ have been pushed back
as never before. May be they are unrealistic
but the ordinary people in their majority
would want that the _Maoists_ should be
around --- guns and all --- but there should be
peace in the sense of a life free of fear from
this side or that. At the height of the six-month
farce of talks between the _Maoists_
and the government of Andhra Pradesh in
the second half of 2004, a common apprehension
heard in most of the long-term
strongholds of the _Naxalites_ was that the
talks was a good thing and it was hoped
that some reduction of violence would
result from it, but "they won't leave us and
go away, will they"?

The fact is that in much of this area the
first time the common people experienced
anything resembling justice was when the
_Naxalite_ movement spread there and taught
people not to take injustice lying down.
Unlike the rest of the state where the
_Naxalites_ spread through the armed squads,
in northern Telangana there was a clear
period in the late 1970s and early 1980s
of the last century when it was the mass
organisations --- mainly the agricultural
labourers associations and the student and
youth fronts --- that were the instrument for
the spread of _Maoism_ as an ideology and
a political practice. The phase was soon to
pass and the people would start depending
on the armed squads for justice but the
sense of attainability of justice was a
fundamental change. In very plain terms
the oppressors of local society, whether
upper caste landlords or insensitive public
officials, started dreading the wrath, initially
of the awakened masses, and later of the
well-armed squads composed of cadre born
and brought up in poor families of the very
same villages. Today the old landlords are
no longer there but new local elites have
come up and there is this fear that if the
_Naxalites_ go away, "the poor cannot survive".
It is a matter of choice whether one
sees this as revolution in the mould of
Robinhood, or merely as one instance in
the saga of a _Maoist_ _long march_, which
is not to be freezed into a representative
moment.

# State Repression

From the very beginning the attitude of
the governments in Andhra Pradesh was
one of extreme hostility. Police camps
were set up in villages and the poor were
tortured most inhumanly. It was always
an explicitly political assault. The policemen
in charge of the areas never made
secret of the fact that they were not merely
"maintaining law and order" as the expression
goes. They had the political task of
protecting the landlords and the medieval
mould of society and they were executing
the task. The underground _Naxalite_ activists
were no doubt armed, but their violence
in those days was by and large
selective and in any case not much in
extent. On the other hand, it is said by
everyone who knows --- including police
officers at retirement --- that the fight of
the _Naxalites_ in those days was against
what is generally referred to as feudal
domination, and the economic oppression
of the poor, and in this they were remarkably
successful. Abolition of '_begar_'[^begar] and
payment of some thing close to minimum
wages, two, impeccably constitutional
tasks, were performed by the _Naxalites_.

[^begar]: _Veth_ (or _Vethi_ or _Vetti-chakiri_), also known as _Begar_ (from Persian), was a system of forced labour practised in pre-independence India, in which members of populace were compelled to perform unpaid work for the government/landlords.

The fight for land was not so successful
since the police would not allow the land
left behind by runaway landlords to be
cultivated by the poor. Such land by and
large remains fallow to this day, but it is
not a very significant matter either way
because as a proportion of the total
cultivable area of the districts, or the land
needed by the landless, it is slight in
extent. More would be added to such
fallow land in the days to come when
cultivation of land would be forcibly
stopped by the _Naxalites_, not to take over
the unconscionable acres of landlords, but
as a measure of punishment imposed on
any landed person for having harmed their
cause, but even so the "land struggle" in
the plains areas was not an achievement
of any moment. The encouragement
given to tribals in the forests to cut down
the reserve forests and cultivate the land
was far and away the most successful
land struggle of the _Naxalites_, and not
any struggle against landlords. Its extent
in the five districts of Adilabad,
Warangal, Khammam, East Godavari and
Visakhapatnam has been plaintively estimated
by the government as upwards of
four lakh acres, counting together the
achievement of all the _Naxalite_ parties.
However, after about the first decade and
a half the _Naxalite_ parties came round to
the view that beyond a point such a land
struggle is harmful to the forest-dwellers
themselves, and have since the mid-1990s
imposed quite a successful ban on the
cutting of forests.

It is tempting to speculate what would
have been the result if the government had
appreciated this phase of the _Naxalite_
struggle for what it was, and responded
by means other than repression. Forgetting
class interests and all that, and accepting
the arguments made at face value, one
would perforce describe as one-sided the
argument that it would have legitimised
the use of violence for social/political ends,
which is unacceptable in a democracy. A
blanket condonation of the use of violence
by a group that lives by its own norms,
which are enforceable only by itself is no
doubt unacceptable in any society, even
when it is declared to be for the good of
the oppressed, but the contrary argument
that a positive response from the government
would perhaps have delegitimised
the argument for revolutionary violence
was never considered. That was no doubt
not an innocent lapse, and the rulers had
their reasons for that.

The upshot was heavy repression on the
_Naxalite_ movement, in particular the rural
poor who were part of the movement or
its social base. Extremes of torture and
incarceration in unlawful police custody,
destruction of houses and despoliation of
drinking water wells and fields, framing
of severe criminal cases en masse were the
norm. And "encounter" killings began from
where they left off the day the internal
emergency was lifted. It would again be
interesting to speculate what would
have been the result if the _Maoists_ had
decided not to hit back but concentrate
on exposing the anti-poor bias of the
government and extend their mass activity
to a point that would have given their
aspiration for state power a solid mass
base. It would no doubt have been painful,
but the alternative has not been any less
painful.

# _Maoists_ Hit Back

As it happened, the _Maoists_ hit back.
The first killing of a policeman took place
in June 1985 at Dharmapuri in Karimnagar
district. And then a sub-inspector of police
was killed at Kazipet in Warangal district on
September 2 that year. That was followed
the next day by plainclothes policemen
going in a procession behind the sub-inspector's
dead body killing Ramanadham
--- a senior civil rights activist --- in his
clinic. "Encounters" increased and decapitation
of the limbs of police informers
followed. The police acquired better
weapons and the _Maoists_ followed suit.
Sizeable paramilitary forces were sent to
the state in the mid-1990s but the terror
they created was such that they were soon
sent back. Not, however, before they had
a taste of the _Naxalites_' newly acquired
proficiency in blowing up police vehicles
at will. Almost from the mid-1980s brutal
special police forces meant for eliminating
_Naxalites_ came into being and were allowed
to operate totally incognito --- the most
successful being the _greyhounds_ --- which is
a well trained anti-guerrilla force that lives
and operates as the _Naxalites_' armed squads
do and is bound by no known law, including
the Constitution of India. The armed
squads soon became the focal point of the
activity of the _Maoists_, barring the two
short periods when they were allowed
freedom to conduct their political activity,
both significantly in the immediate aftermath
of the Congress Party coming to
power after prolonged Telugu Desam rule,
leading to credible speculation about some
pre-election agreement between the Congress
and the _Maoists_ (known till two years
ago as the _Communist Party of India
(Maoist-Leninist) (Peoples War)_).

Soon the _Maoists_ declared the whole of
northern Telangana, and the eastern ghat
hills to the north of the Godavari river,
guerrilla zones, followed later by a similar
proclamation for the Nallamala forests in
the Krishna basin to the south. With this
the changed context of the movement was
formalised. The immediate economic and
social problems of the masses took a back
seat and the battle for supremacy with the
state became the central instance of the
struggle. This brought its own imperatives,
which were no longer immediately congruent
with the needs of the masses who
continued to be the base of the _Maoists_.
So much so that while the youth in the areas
of their activity look upon them as militant
heroes even when they do not approve of
them, it is the elderly who talk of them with
affection. It is the parents' generation that
remembers the days when _begar_ used to
be demanded by the landlord and a pittance
paid for wage labour. Many of the youth
frankly say, they may be valiant fighters,
but what have they done for us except to
bring the police to our villages?

The state has its difficulties dealing with
mass movements, but it has tested strategies
for dealing with armed struggles. It creates
informers and agents for itself from the
very masses the insurgency claims to
represent. That is not difficult with the
money and resources of power available
with the state. This is a trap the militants
fall into. They kill or otherwise injure
those agents and informers and thereby
antagonise more of their own mass base,
in turn enabling the state to have more
agents and informers. Without exception,
all militant movements have killed more
people of their own social base than their
purported enemy classes. This may be taken
as one of the invariant laws of the sociology
of armed insurgencies. The very fact
that this is true of the _Naxalites_ --- the most
politically sensitive of all insurgents --- is
proof enough. And this is true even without
the impatience that comes with being
armed, which results in more violence
against dissenters among your own people.

It is not as if they no longer addressed
themselves to the social and economic
problems of the poor. They did and they
continue to do, but notwithstanding their
claim that the village committees (often
semi-secret) established by them deal with
these problems, though not in the open as
in the past, the overwhelming reality, except
in totally isolated villages --- and totally
isolated areas such as the Abujmarh hills
of Bastar --- where such committees can
actually function, is that it is the armed
squads that deal with the problems. And
they too often deal with them in a rough
and ready manner made easy by the fact
that there is no possibility of any opposition
to them in society, so long as the police
are taken care of. The people for their part
have come to look up to the squads as a
substitute for their own struggle for justice.
This has, on the one hand, created more
enemies --- victims of revolutionary arbitrariness
--- than they need have made, and,
on the other, corrupted the masses into
receivers of justice rather than fighters for
it. You only have to report to the militants
and get them to put up posters with appropriate
demands and threats, and you will
get what you want, provided that in the
meanwhile the police have not made it
impossible for the militants to come to
your area to hear your pleas and put up
posters. Then, of course, you wait till the
militants turn the tables on the police.

But even where such issues are addressed,
the central place in the practice of the
_Maoists_ has been taken up by the guerrilla
struggle against the state, aimed at weakening
its hold to a point where the area
can be considered a liberated zone. This
requires a range of acts of violence, which
have no direct relation to the immediate
realisation of any rights for the masses,
though the resulting repression invariably
hits at the masses. The _Maoists_ have
developed considerable expertise of a
military character, which is admired even
by policemen in private, even as their
political development has stagnated. The
state has met this with even more brutal
violence, which has bred further violence
from the _Maoists_.

For at least about a decade now, each
year has seen between 300 to 400 deaths
in this gruesome game. The ability of the
state to obtain information on an extensive
scale, thanks partly to its resources, partly
to the demise of values at all levels in
society, including the lower-most, and
partly to the large number of enemies
created by the _Maoists_ around themselves
in the course of their battle with the state,
the state's ability for the same reasons to
inject covert operatives into the _Maoist_
ranks, and the very successful forays of
the _greyhounds_ deep into the forests, has
resulted in its establishing a clear upperhand
in this killing game for the present.

# Retaining Support of the Next Generation

But the difficulties faced by the _Maoists_
do not end here. To discuss the rest of them
requires attention to considerations that
_Marxism_ at its best would find difficult to
deal with, given the lack of any attention
to an understanding of the human subject
of history other than the practically useless
profundity that "it makes itself while making
history". And _Maoism_ is not _Marxism_
at its best, at any rate for this purpose. The
strategy of providing armed support to the
aspirations of the masses succeeds at the
first round without much difficulty, once
willing cadre are found, in areas historically
subjected to extremes of deprivation
and oppression and neglected by governance.
But the very success means that a
new generation is created, which is freed
from the severe disabilities its parents
suffered from, and is able to see and seize
opportunities in the existing polity and
therefore may not be as hospitable to armed
struggle as its parents. The state too learns,
and makes some efforts to draw the area
from out of neglect and into what is usually
described as "the mainstream" even as it
suppresses the struggle by brute force. The
eagerness to join a life-and-death struggle
is usually diluted to some extent as a
consequence. If, at that stage, instead of
toning down the armed component of
struggle the radicals proceed to fight the
state over the heads of the masses, the
masses can withdraw further, and even
become resentful. After the first immense
success of the _Maoists_ among the _Gonds_
of Adilabad district in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, from the next generation that
came of age in the1990s one often heard
the honest query: are _adivasis_ the guinea
pigs of revolution? The temptation to which
the _Maoists_ have too often succumbed,
namely, to condemn all such doubt as
arising from the "_petty-bourgeois_ tendencies"
of a new elite only makes matters
worse. In this sense the real challenge for
the _Maoists_ is not whether they can militarily
get the better of the _greyhounds_,
who have a clear upper hand at present,
but whether they can retain active support
from one generation to the next
while retaining their _Maoist_ strategy, or
even by recasting it to suit the changes in
the needs and aspirations of the new
generation in the changed social context
created by their very activity and the state's
response to it.

Till now there is no sign of any thinking
along these lines. Often the first thing that
happens to people who find political
awakening from a state of dormancy is to
turn to a search for their own social identity,
whether caste, tribe or gender. This
has led to many ex-_Naxalites_ becoming
_Ambedkarites_, or at least sympathisers of
_Ambedkarism_, since any way the overwhelming
majority of them are from the
outcastes or backward castes of Hindu
society. This does not necessarily mean
that they have lost interest in revolution
as the communists understand it. But the
_Maoists_ have too often reacted with a lack
of sympathy to this phenomenon. So much
so that while their cadre, and leaders too,
except a handful at the very top, are from the
dalit, _adivasi_ or backward communities,
unlike the Parliamentary left which continues
to be a bastion of upper castes, and while
they have in the last few years inducted
women into their armed squads on a scale
that will soon probably put to shame the
eternally unfilled promise of one-third
reservation in the legislatures, they remain
not only theoretically but practically
too, hostile to any expression of identity
politics, seen invariably as opportunistic
deviance.

Instead the _Maoist_ response to stagnation
after the first round has been to transfer
attention to a new area amenable to initiation
of their kind of politics --- and there
are many such areas, thanks to the utter
neglect of vast regions by governance in
the last 50 years, and the current philosophy
of governance which is a philosophy
of non-governance --- and do the same
thing again. Other Marxist-Leninist groups
have often criticised the _Maoists_ for this
hop, skip and jump mode of revolution but
they have never taken the criticism seriously,
probably regarding their conduct as
part of the strategy of guerrilla struggle.
Leaving aside the political rights and
wrongs of it, the practical consequence has
been a rapid spread to new areas such as
the area surrounding the Nallamala and
other contiguous forests in southern coastal
Andhra and Rayalaseema. This spread has
been mainly through the guerrilla activity
of armed squads, not preceded by anything
comparable with the mass activity that
illuminated and remedied much of the social
and economic oppression people suffered
from in the Godavari basin districts of
northern Telangana. But the spread has not
been as smooth and successful as in northern
Telangana.

Whatever _Maoist_ theory may say, the
guerrilla phase of struggle involves establishing
armed dominion over society, often
described by the police with exaggeration
as a parallel government. Such dominion
is easier to establish in areas whose social
culture is characterised by a certain quiescence
than in factious areas. The northern
Telangana districts, of all the areas of the
state, do exhibit that characteristic whereas
the south, especially the region surrounding
the Nallamala forests, is the most factious
area. Armed activity of any kind, with even
the best of intentions, can degenerate easily
into factious violence. The fate of the
_Maoists_ in Anantapur in Rayalaseema is
a classic instance of this. More vitally,
armed dominion in factious areas calls up
private vengeance which the state will not
hesitate to encourage. The '_Nallamala
cobras_' who have committed three murders
of democratic activists in the last nine
months and silenced much of democratic
activity in the southern districts constitute
brutal proof of this.

We know that each mode of life is found
attractive by persons of certain character
traits and in turn encourages certain traits
in those who partake of it. It is a species
of conceit that refuses to see that this
applies to political strategies too. To speak
of negative traits alone, just as the
_Sarvodaya_ philosophy attracts a lot of
hypocrisy and the parliamentary strategy
of the _Communist Party of India_ and the
_Communist Party of India (Marxist)_ a lot
of opportunism, strategies of militancy
attract unruly types who straddle the border
line between rebellion and mere rowdyism.
These types can, and have, caused
considerable harm to the _Maoists_ and have
constituted easy subjects for the state's
tactics of shaping covert operatives inside
their ranks. Once outside the party they have
fit equally well the role of "_renegades_" as
they are called in Kashmir. The conduct
of the _Maoists_ who leave little room for
appeal for persons whom they brand
_enemies of the people_ has in turn created
cadre for the _vengeful renegades_, and the
resulting gangs that call themselves _cobras_
and _tigers_ of various kinds have played a
major role in immobilising the very substantial
overground support activity the
_Naxalite_ movement had.

# Decimation of Organic Leaders

This is as far as the story of _Maoist_
revolution has come in Andhra Pradesh.
Since there is little sign of any rethinking
on either side, one has no basis for expressing
much hope about the future. What
makes it a tragedy is that the lives of lakhs
of people belonging to the lowest orders
of society in terms of community as well
as class are involved in it. Many dimensions
of the tragedy are known or amenable to
imagination but there is one which is not
usually commented on. This is that many
if not all of the lives that are being lost
at the hands of the police in this process
are lives that the oppressed can ill afford
to lose. They are the organic leaders of the
class, who have adopted a political path
of their choice. It is not all among the
powerless classes that can dare challenge
the system and be ready to pay for it. It
is not everyday that the oppressed produce
such elements from amongst themselves.
The rights or wrongs of their choice has
no bearing on the tragedy of the decimation
of this organic leadership. They chose to
be _Maoists_, but they could have chosen to
be something else, and whichever the
choice, they would have added to the
strength of the oppressed. The daily loss
of such persons is a sacrifice the oppressed
cannot be called upon to put up with
indefinitely.
