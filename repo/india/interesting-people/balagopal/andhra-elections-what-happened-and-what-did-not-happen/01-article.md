\ 

Somebody has remarked tongue-in-cheek
that the two-party system has come to stay
in Andhra Pradesh. The characteristic feature
of this much hankered after state of political
grace is that there are two hardly
distinguishable political formations each with
its own constituency of loyal voters, while
the non-loyal voters shift from the one to the
other in sufficient measure from one election
to the next to ensure that governments keep
changing with predictable regularity --- if not
an entirely predictable periodicity. Critics
lacking in the blessed spirit of charity will
call it a _tweedledum-tweedledee_ political
system, but it is no doubt better than having
a single _tweedledum_ ruling in perpetuity.
For one thing, while the general social and
political character of the government remains
the same from one change to the next, there
is some check on how cavalierly the rulers
can play games with the people. Congressmen
of Andhra Pradesh who took their power for
granted got a shock this time that they have
not recovered from even a month afterwards.'
Secondly, the competition for the votes of
the elusive voters who sit on the fence and
amuse themselves by voting this way once
and that way the next time does lead to
however partial an attempt to meet the dire
needs of the voting public at large, a healthy
fall-out of political uncertainty that
Manmohan Singh's admirers describe as
'_populism_'. Blessed is this _populism_ without
which many more would have starved to
death in this land which is marching from
_brahminical cruelty_ to _capitalist cruelty_, from
the _rule of dharma_ to the _iron rule of the
International Monetary Fund_. And thirdly,
there is this thing called empowerment of the
powerless that everyone talks of a lot these
days. One is not talking of the gratuitous
empowerment that the CPI and _CPI(M)_ are
enjoying in Andhra Pradesh this season, but
the empowerment of what the Supreme Court
has with unfelicitous contempt described as
the 'creamy layer' of the _dalits_ and the
backward castes. For all its much despised
creaminess this class or class-fraction would
have had little chance of coming close to
positions of power if a Congress clone such
as the _Telugu Desam Party_ had not come
about and afforded the dynamic among the
lower castes a chance to play one party
against the other and push themselves into
positions of power in this party or that. This
too, of course, is '_populism_', for it is not
necessarily congruent with the most 'efficient
use' of the nation's resources that is the ruling
dogma of today's India.

All this is not to say that alternatives to
the Congress such as the _Telugu Desam
Party_ are the best that could have happened
in this best of all possible worlds --- for that
would be taking a needlessly pessimistic
view of an admittedly imperfect world. For
the deadening effect that this replication of
the Congress by other names has on the
political culture of a people is an incalculably
vicious consequence of the emergence of
charismatic fakes such as N T Rama Rao.
The purpose of this prologue, rather, is to
caution against contemptuous attitudes
towards '_populism_' on the one hand, and on
the other against the inability to sec that in
human affairs _desirable ends_ can and
frequently do realise themselves in seemingly
immaterial, utterly uninspiring and even
incongruous changes. The human historical
agent is no match for its own glorious
aspirations, and as much progress in its affairs
(as well as resistance to retrogression) is
wrought by incongruous irrelevancies as by
revolutionary planning and firmness.

It is necessary also to caution against a
third attitude, which is being developed into
a whole myth by _CPI(M)_ circles. This is to
read in the recent victory of the _Telugu
Desam Party_ a rejection of P V Narasimha
Rao's economic reforms. The CPI and the
_CPI(M)_ are at liberty to collect all manner
of political creatures --- including Congress
clones, crooks and opportunists who would
rather be in the Congress than outside it
--- around them; and in this free world one
cannot prevent them from christening this
motley grouping --- a _left and democratic alliance_
or a _national alternative_ or whatever; but one
should firmly insist that they stop interpreting
reality to suit their tactics. Assuming that the
TDP won on a vote for cheap rice, that only
indicates popular resentment at rising prices
and hungry stomachs. It is part of an
unfortunate culture of interpretation that has
become common with marxists to argue that
since the recent spurt in prices is a
consequence of economic liberalisation, the
vote against price rise is objectively a vote
against liberalisation. The gap between this
reductionist interpretation and the actual
consciousness of the people is an abyss that
renders the interpretation a particularly bad
case of wishful thinking. It is the wishful
realisation of two elusive desires --- one, that
the people at large should recognise that
economic reforms are bad for them, and
should consciously reject them; and two, that
the left forces should succeed in leading the
people to the realisation.

It is of course a matter of delight to believe
that the Telugu people stood up firmly against
the prime minister's regressive economic
policies and gave the old man a resounding
rebuff for having presumed that because he
is a 'child of the Telugus', the state would
vote by him in a time of crisis. It is indeed
true enough that the sentimental response
that he expected (he used the word _bidda_
which means daughter rather than son in his
native Telangana, and in general Telugu
usage connotes the child in its dependent and
helpless aspect) was not forthcoming from
the electorate. And yet, happy though one
would be to arrive at such a conclusion, there
is little reason to see the defeat of the Congress
as principally a rejection of the prime
minister's presumptuous appeal for support
to his '_structural adjustment_' policies. Of the
three reasons offered for the victory of the
TDP --- rejection of the _economic reforms_,
vote for NTR's _cheap rice and prohibition
policies_,and _infighting_ of the Congress --- the
third and the least glamorous appears to have
been the most significant, however reluctant
we may be to accept such unromantic
conclusions. _Economic reform_ in the abstract
was an irrelevant matter not only because the
people at large are far from being aware of
its implications and conscious in rejecting
it, but also because NTR is hardly anti-liberalisation.
He is like most Congressmen,
as much a convinced advocate of the
_philosophy of the market_ as he is utterly
feudal in his cultural attitudes, and the _Telugu
Desam Party_ has never spoken out against
liberalisation as such, though it has put to
skilfull electoral use the consequent price rise.

The cheap rice scheme has no doubt
attracted people --- and quite rightly --- whatever
may be said by persons who are worried
about "budgetary discipline". The question of
budgetary profligacy cannot be divorced from
the larger question of how and on what basis
the nation's resources are being shared out,
and when that is left either to the _bureaucrat-politician
nexus_ or the laws of the _capitalist
jungle_ --- in neither of which the weak have any
place --- they are bound to seek protective
schemes from the government on pain of
voting it out. Especially because what such
schemes eat into is administrative or infrastructural
investment of a kind that does not
solve their food and employment problems,
except by way of an unredeemable assurance.

Much the same can be said about prohibition.
The movement for total prohibition
that appeared on the scene in Andhra Pradesh
after country liquor (_arrack_) was banned in
1993 upon pressure from the rural women's
struggle, was in fact not a movement to
match the earlier _anti-arrack_ struggle. The
modern variety of inebriating fluid called
Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL)[^imfl]
is a middle class, lower middle class
and organised working class men's addiction,
and while women of these families are as
much its victims as women of rural labouring
classes are of _arrack_, they did not come out
into the streets as the latter did. The total
_prohibition agitation_ was a meetings and
seminars affair promoted through the press
by _Eenadu_, a paper that combines anti-Congressism
with a determined effort to
recreate lost legitimacy for the state's ruling
elite. And yet, both the main political parties
were fearful of the appeal the issue may have
for women voters. Men are evidently never
fully sure that the weighty arguments they
offer (ranging from reasons of common sense
to those of fiscal sense) for their inability
to cure themselves of the addiction to drink
as a habit and their addiction to the business
of drink as a very lucrative economic
activity, will ever convince women who
suffer --- physically, emotionally and
economically from it. And so NTR jumped
in and declared that he would impose total
prohibition within half an hour if he was
voted to power, and the Congress chimed
in saying that (though nobody believed
them) they too would do so in due course,
no matter that both the parties are chockful
of manufacturers and vendors of liquor
--- licensed or illicit.

[^imfl]: Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) is the official term used by governments, businesses and media in India to refer to all types of hard liquor manufactured in the country other than indigenous alcoholic beverages such as _feni_, _toddy_, _arrack_ and others.

And yet. voting statistics do not show that
it is the cheap rice scheme and prohibition
that were primarily responsible for NTR's
phenomenal victory. The percentage of votes
the TDP and its allies got this time was not
substantially higher than what they got last
time, though as the polling percentage was
higher this time, it means that a larger
proportion of the electorate voted for them.
What is striking is not the increase in TDP
(plus allies) votes, but the fall in Congress
votes, which appears to have been as much
as 12 to 14 percentage points. A small part
of these votes went to the TDP, another
small part went to the BJP and the _BSP_,
but the major part of it went to Congress
rebels. This cornering of votes by Congress
rebels is a very significant fact revealed by
the voting statistics. The Congress has truly
become a veritable jungle of clawing and
biting wild animals which are unmindful
of the possibility that they will destroy the
species in the process. No tears need be
wasted over this, but their unconcern is a
study in depravity. In district after district
it was senior Congressmen who first of all
played all possible dirty games to get
candidates of their choice nominated, and
when they failed against the wily Congress
president who can play as dirty games as
any of them, they set up their own candidates
against the official nominees, or otherwise
queered the pitch for their party. Members
of parliament Dronamraju Satyanarayana
in Visakhapatnam. Vizianagaram and
Srikakulam districts; Magunta Subbarami
Reddy in Nellore and Prakasam districts;
Y S Rajasekhar Reddy in Cuddapah and
Anantapur districts; Rayapati Sambasiva Rao
in Guntur district; Ganga Reddy in
Nizamabad district; former union minister
Jalagam Vengal Rao in Khammam district
and smaller fry elsewhere did their worst to
get Congress candidates defeated. Their
success in this effort was the most significant
factor in deciding the huge margin of the
Congress' defeat.

It is not that but for this the Congress
would have won. The prohibition, the cheap
rice scheme and general disgust with the
Congress had done enough to stabilise the
normal TDP vote and to decide the minds
of the fluid voters. But for Congress
infighting, it appears the TDP would in any
case have won but with an unspectacular
margin that would have left no scope for the
largely misplaced encomiums the Telugu
electorate is receiving for its perspicacity,
firmness and wisdom, nor any room for
myth-making about popular rejection of the
"_structural adjustment_" policies.

Apart from the price rise, and resultant
deterioration of living conditions, the other
significant issue in the elections was whether
and to what extent persons of scheduled
castes, tribes and backward castes would
come into positions of power in the changed
context of _post-Mandal politics_[^mandal-politics]. Such an
aspiration can be dismissed as seeking power
'within the present oppressive system' as
many Marxists have done, but since it is
precisely one of the oppressive characteristics
of the present system that positions of
importance and authority are denied (both
by virtue of the socio-economic structure
and by conspiratorial tactics) to persons of
the lower castes, such an aspiration is not
a desire for change 'within the system' but
is an attempt to dent the system along at least
one dimension. This much is true, whether one
believes that this will in due course generalise
itself into a larger assault on the system in
all its oppressive dimensions, or one suspects
that it will end with a widening of the social
base of the Indian state and capital. Indeed,
which of these will happen is not something
that can be predicted beforehand.

[^mandal-politics]: In 1979, Morarji Desai government appointed a commission under chairmanship of Bindheshwari Prasad Mandal, who was then Member of Parliament. This commission (referred to as _Mandal Commission_) was entrusted with the task of identifying socially & educationally backward classes in India. In its findings commission identified 3743 different caste & communities as _backward_ on various parameters. These castes comprised of almost 52% of total population of India. In recommendations, commission proposed the idea of giving 27% reservation to these backward caste/classes in public employment along with SC & ST. Post this report, many castes came to dominating position within politics in their own states (usually from backwards castes). Politics post the report is called _post-Mandal politics_.

The victory of the SP-BSP in Uttar Pradesh
on the basis of an explicitly _anti-Hindutva_
campaign inspired many _dalit_ activists in
Andhra Pradesh to join the _Bahujan Samaj
Party (BSP)_ and try to build it into a major political
force in the state. Kanshi Ram, too, took a
lot of pains to campaign in the stae. The
_dalit_ movement has developed into an
important political force in AP in the last
decade, and a very sizeable part of the
movement joined the BSP --- unfortunately
bringing with it its internal contradictions
too. The other sizeable stream to join the
BSP (especially in the Telangana districts)
was that of former _naxalites_, of whom
KG Satyamurthy and Chiranjeevi are the
most prominent.

Nobody expected the BSP to win many
seats in the elections, though BSP leaders,
in imitation of the dominant political culture
whose tone is set by the Congress, made
vastly exaggerated claims about the seats
they would win and the policies their
government would adopt; and while the
overstatement was very evident, most people
were wary of cautioning them for fear of
being dubbed _anti-dalit_, a term of abuse as
potent today as '_petite bourgeois_' was in the
heyday of the now faded glory of communism.
As it happened, the BSP won no
seats and indeed it lost its deposit in all but
one constituency, the exception being Bapatla
in Guntur district where Katli Padma Rao,
founder-general secretary of the _AP Dalit
Mahasabha_ did quite well.

But the entry of the BSP into electoral
politics of Andhra Pradesh in a big way
signifies not the possibility of immediate
political power but the shifting of _dalit_
political consciousness from the agitational
arena to the electoral arena and its consolidation
therein as a political party. If the BSP
leaders had acknowledged this distinction,
disciplined their claims accordingly, and
concentrated on organisational work and on
the elaboration of the full logic of their
principal campaign slogan: '_vote hamara,
seat tumhara --- nahin chalega, nahin chalega_',
they need have caused no disappointment
to their hopeful followers and sympathisers
at the end. They spoilt things by neglecting
organisational work to the point that they
went through the elections without any
organisational structure at all, dependent
solely on Kanshi Ram's image and the appeal
of their ideology; by making no attempt to
set right the internal divisions which soon
became public in ugly scenes at the time of
seat allotment; and by allowing disenchanted
SC and BC leaders from the Congress and
TDP for whom the _dalit_ activists have no
regard to enter the party and acquire
importance in it.

The other outcome expected from the entry
of the BSP was that whether the Congress
won or the TDP won, more persons from
the lower castes would attain positions of
political importance, which also would be
a social advance irrespective of what one
thinks of the Congress and TDP as political
parties. For the first time perhaps in the
history of the Congress Party, backward
caste and scheduled caste leaders talked
openly about the injustice done to the lower
castes by the Congress leaders in the allotment
of seats and offices. Though they would add
the ritual declamation that Kanshi Ram was
an adventurer and that the Congress alone
would solve the problems of _dalits_ under the
leadership of P V Narasimha Rao --- 'great
friend of the weaker sections'. It was evident
that they owed their new-found courage to
that very adventurer and not to the 'great
friend of the weaker sections'. On the other
hand, the Congress leadership became jittery
at the large turnouts that attended Kanshi
Ram's public meetings in the beginning.
Vijaya Bhaskar Reddy, the Congress chief
minister of the state, mobilised Congress
leaders of each of the toiling castes to hold
rallies of that caste at Hyderabad to which
he himself would be invited as chief guest
and would promise all things under the sun
to that community --- subsidised yarn to
weavers, quarries to stone cutters, excise
contracts to _toddy tappers_, etc. As ticket-distribution
day neared, grand promises were
made that a large proportion of the Congress
tickets would be given to persons of the
lower castes.

And simultaneously, upper caste leaders
for the first time started acknowledging caste
openly. They gave up the earlier pretence
that they had been dominating politics by
virtue of sheer merit. _Brahmins_ held meetings
at Vijayawada, Nellore and Hyderabad in
which one demand was that they should be
allotted the tickets to certain specified
constituencies, as the _brahmin_ population
therein was sizeable. This is the kind of
argument that in the past only Muslims,
Christians or backward castes would have
used, and would have been branded narrowly
casteist or sectarian by _brahmins_. _Kamma_
Congressmen who have always felt
overwhelmed by the _Reddys_ in that party
held a meeting and resolved obliquely that
all castes should be given tickets in proportion
commensurate with their 'importance'
--- which in their case means not only numbers
but also economic power, of which they
have plenty. And the _Reddys_ took visible
pains to explain away their embarrassing
preponderance in the Congress. Thus, _bahujan
politics_ had achieved the first victory that
any rebel movement aspires for --- to force the
dominant groups to dump their myths and
acknowledge the hidden aspects of reality.

Unfortunately, the opportunities opened
up by these developments slipped away as
elections neared,with the visible decline in
the euphoria surrounding the BSP. The
Congress and TDP leaders soon felt quite
reassured, and not many more seats were
allotted to the SCs and BCs than is usual.
And in N T Rama Rao's new cabinet, the
number and the importance of the posts
given to the SCs and BCs is not very different
from the past. A beginning has, however,
been made in the matter, and the future can
witness more significant changes if the BSP
leadership draws the requisite lessons from
this experience.

And there was plenty of violence, too.
Rayalaseema warlord gangsterism has in the
last few years become a major topic of
lament in Andhra Pradesh. One reason could
be the legitimacy problems it creates for the
rulers, especially in view of the democracy
_vs_ violence antithesis that dominates their
discussion of _naxalism_. Another reason is
the growing awareness of democracy and
democratic rights among the people of
Rayalaseema. A third reason is the growth
of the gangsterism into a major cancer in
recent years, with its transmutation into an
instrument of money-making and political
advancement. Violence, as a consequence,
has accompanied all recent elections, as has
the exhortation that the violence should be
--- and the promise that it will be --- contained
in the interests of "democracy". This time
round, the fear of Seshan --- of his arbitrariness
rather than the legal authority of the Election
Commission, of whose exact extent nobody
including Seshan is clear --- restrained the
contenders somewhat. But nevertheless there
was plenty of rigging, bomb throwing and
killing. At Dhone in Kurnool district, from
where Vijayabhaskar Reddy contested, all
the village factions united to rig the polls
in the then chief minister's favour, and there
was none left to protest in the villages.
Alampur in neighbouring Mahbubnagar
district saw a triangular fight that held up
electioneering in the faction-ridden area to
the most ludicrous light. The Congress
candidate was a recent convert from the
_Telugu Desam Party_, and the _Telugu Desam Party_
candidate conversely a recent convert from
the Congress, both of them _Reddy_ factionists
from Kurnool district, transported to
Mahbubnagar district as a solution to the
impossible seat-distribution problem. The
third candidate was the sitting BJP MLA,
also a _Reddy_ factionist --- but a local man. As
a local voter described the three in helpless
humour --- _one makes bombs in his house,
one on the terrace and one in the basement_.
The three of them made such thorough
nonsense of the polling process that the
entire constituency had to have a repoll,
certainly an unusual thing.

But an entirely humourless terror stalked
northern Telangana this time. The obstinate
attempt by the _People's War Group_ (_PWG_)
to obstruct the poll campaign at all cost, and
the determination of the police to thwart this
attempt equally at any cost led to a spate
of violence in which more than 50 lives were
lost. Neither those who believe in electoral
politics nor those who reject it would reckon
it worth so many lives. The _PWG_ asked the
people to boycott the polls as usual and also
threatened the contesting candidates not to
campaign, on pain of physical violence (they
made an exception from this ban on campaign
for the _CPI(ML)_ candidates and the _BSP_
candidates). Those campaigners who violated
this rule had their vehicles burnt and their
bones broken. The police moved in, not
merely to protect the contestants from this
violence, but also to defeat the _PWG_'s
political tactics and ensure that votes are
polled in large numbers. This much has
happened in past elections too. The ostensible
purpose of the police has been to ensure that
'voters can vote freely and fearlessly', though
it is a matter of common knowledge that
while, the _PWG_ has violently prevented the
contestants from exercising their legitimate
right to campaign, it has not interfered with
the people's right to vote, in case they choose
to disobey the _PWG_ and go and vote. But
this time round, no bones were made about
the real purpose of the police: they were not
there to merely protect the contestants' right
to campaign and the voters' right to vote,
but to defeat the entire political effort of the
_PWG_ _vis-à-vis_ the elections, no matter that
it is no part of their job to do so. The police
held meetings in village after village in
which inspectors would openly threaten
people that if they did not vote, their ration
cards would be withdrawn, the electricity
connection to the village would be cut and
their children would be denied social welfare
scholarships. It was certainly an odd way of
giving confidence to voters who may wish
to defy the _PWG_'s direction.

To aid the AP police, a large number of
_CRPF_[^crpf] and _BSF_[^bsf] men were dumped in the
_PWG_-influenced districts. A particularly
vicious and drunken lot of paramilitary
commandos were brought from the Punjab
and stationed in Karimnagar district,
apparently because more terror must be
inflicted to ensure that votes are polled in
the prime minister's native district. The way
these Punjab commandos behaved is
testimony to what can happen if the police
are allowed to develop into a lawless force
in the name of suppressing political or social
lawlessness. Drink and women were the
principal interests of these commandos. They
drank everything they could lay their hands
on, pawed women in village lanes, raped a
vegetable-seller in Ramagundam, and
succeeded in driving women off the streets
in panic wherever they were stationed. When
the harassed people complained to the local
police --- those worthies who are usually a
terror to everyone --- expressed helplessness
and suggested that the women keep to their
homes until 'those fellows leave the district'.
Not to be outdone, men of a _CRPF_ platoon
stationed at Kataram raped another woman,
a _dalit_ labourer by name Salamma. who was
however helped by press reporters to go to
the district collector and superintendent of
police and lodge a complaint. The
administration ordered an enquiry by a
woman IPS officer who managed to coerce
the victim to say that she had not been raped
by anyone but had got drunk and fallen, and
then started eliciting the 'background' of the
pressmen who had taken interest in the matter.

[^crpf]: Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is the central police force of the Govt of India thats deployed for maintaining _internal "security"_.

[^bsf]: Border Security Force (BSF) is the border guarding organisation of the Govt of India.

The strategy adopted by the police to
defeat the _PWG_'s intentions was to gather
from each village youth known to be
sympathisers of the _PWG_ and bold them
hostages from about a month prior to the day
of polling. The implicit threat was that they
would be objects of retaliatory killing if the
_PWG_ indulged in excessive violence. And
these youth were also meant to be lined up
before polling stations and compulsorily
made to vote on polling day, as a
demonstrative exhibition of the "success" of
the police in defeating the intentions of the
_People's War Group_. Not many people in
this country would perhaps believe that about
3,000 youth were thus held like slaughter
animals in police custody for the whole
month of November. The _PWG_, for its part,
as if to challenge the police to kill the
hostages, senselessly landmined two vehicles
carrying policemen and killed 16 persons
including a few civilians, in the last week
of November.

The first incident was at Lenkalagadda,
an interior village of Karimnagar district, in
which some Punjab commandos travelling
in a tractor were blown up and killed along
with the tractor driver and the local sub-inspector
of police; and the second incident
happened right near Warangal town, and on
a state highway to boot, killing paramilitary
men of the _AP Special Police_. The second
landmine was apparently intended for the
Congress government's municipal
administration minister Madadi Narnsimha
Reddy. an old enemy of the _PWG_, but he
escaped and a police escort vehicle was hit.

This macabre challenge was expectedly
taken up by the police and there ensued a
killing spree in which 35 persons were shot
dead. 34 in Warangal and Karimnagar
districts and one in Nizamabad district. Most
of them were picked up from home or place
of work in the full view and against the
protests of their kith and kin and colleagues
and shot dead within a few hours in some
neighbouring village. Oddly enough the
police did not kill any of the 3,000 suspected
sympathisers already in their custody. That
would not create enough of terror, and it is
terror that the police want. So they went one
step worse, and picked up youth who had
not even been considered to have enough
links with the _PWG_ to merit prior detention
and killed them. All the killings except one
were the handiwork of the local police, the
one exception being worthy of detailed
mention. The victim was a 45-year old _dalit_
woman. Manthena Rajammaof Lakkepur in
Karimnagar district mother of five daughters
and a son. On the afternoon of November
29 some Punjab command os from Gajulapalli
camp went to Lakkepur on a raid, searching
for hidden _naxalites_ or hidden ammunition.
They were fully drunk on _toddy_ and heavily
armed with automatic weapons. When they
approached Rajamma's house she tried to
leave by a side door for she was alone in
the house and was scared at the prospect of
the search But they spotted her and by signs
asked her to come back. They entered the
house and found one of the two rooms
locked. They asked her to open it. As the
terrified woman fumbled with the key for
a minute, one of the impatient commandos
aimed his gun at her and shot her right
through her back. The bullet killed her, went
through the locked door and emerged out
of the other wall to lodge in the wall of the
neighbour's house. The drunk commandos
then went out telling the horrified villagers:
'_buddi mar gayi_'.

This killing went on till December 3, and
polling in north Telangana was on December 5.
On the previous evening the youth in
custody were sent home to vote and get votes
polled in their villages the next day, and
come back again to report at the police
station the day after polling. The implied
threat again was that if not enough votes
were polled, the youth could be killed. Indeed,
the threat was not left implicit. It was stated
bluntly. In any case, there was quite heavy
polling in the north Telangana districts and
all Congress heavy weights including the
prime minister's son and his in-law lost
massively. The losers themselves attributed
their defeat at least in part to the methods
adopted by the police (with their sanction, of
course, though they would dishonestly put
all the blame on the police after their defeat).

In the course of this bloodbath, the main
issue between the two armed contenders was
left undecided: how many people would
have voted, and how many would have
boycotted the polls, if they had had peaceful
conditions for the exercise of their choice?
And in the interests of what great principle
had so many lives been lost?

# IV

The final question that remains is: What
do elections signify in the new politico-economic
consensus of the ruling classes?
Economic liberalism does not render political
power irrelevant, for what it nullifies is not
governmental authority but governmental
social responsibility. The Indian state of the
1990s is not a powerless political entity, not
the ideal of 19th century liberalism. What
it is freed from is only responsibility for the
welfare of the people. The rest of its authority
and responsibility is intact. And so it
continues to be as profitable to be in the
business of politics as in the days of the
_licence-permit raj_[^licence-permit-raj]; perhaps more so, for lots
of money is flowing into the country now
both in the private and public sectors: and
with 'globalisation' the stakes of all politico-economic
activity is pushed up and computed
in worthier currencies than the good old
rupee.

[^licence-permit-raj]: The Licence Raj or Permit Raj (_rāj_, meaning "rule" in Hindi) was the system of licences, regulations, and accompanying red tape which are means adopted by politician-bureaucrat-business combination to stop competitors from entering a space & pay rent to politicians & bureaucrats if anyone wants to enter a market.

Politicians' hunger for political office has
therefore increased and not decreased, and
the private wealth they have at their disposal
has also increased with the multiplication of
economic opportunities available to the
propertied classes. They have therefore
fought tooth and nail to get 'tickets' from
winning parties and have used the most
shameless means to get elected. It is trite to
say that political morality has never been as
low as this, for it gets lower and lower day
by day and is always lower than it has ever
been. And the contingent human imagination
which (for all its pretensions to unlimited
vision) is bound by experience and possible
extrapolation believes on each day that it has
sighted the nadir, but what it has seen is only
the murkiest depths it can imagine, the nadir
of its imaginative capabilities.

The norms laid down by Seshan to
discipline campaigning and to limit campaign
expenditure to legally permissible limits has
meant reduced publicity expenditure for the
candidates, which has actually hurt the
newcomers like the _BSP_ and parties like the
CPI(ML) groups which participate in
elections, for wide publicity for their views,
slogans and symbols is crucial for them
rather than the Congress and TDP. For the
latter the expense saved on this account has
meant more to spend on unaccounted activity,
such as the eleventh-hour distribution of
cash and liquor which is a common feature
of Indian elections. Votes were paid for at
an unprecedented rate this time but whether
they were successfully purchased is difficult
to tell. In any case, the _Telugu Desam Party_
is not "yesterday's baby" (to borrow Seshan's
memorable caveat about himself) and can
spend as much as the Congress, and so it
probably made no difference in the end.

But what elections mean for the voters in
the new era is that this is one of the times
they can put pressure to force the political
system to be answerable to their needs, no
matter that such answerability is called
'_populism_' these days. As the social
responsibility of the government has been
officially discarded, it must be enforced by
the collective assertions of the people. One
such possible moment of assertion is election
time, when the threat of voting politicians
out of power can help bend official policies.
Perhaps it is the recognition of this
possibility that has by a peculiar cognitive
jump turned itself into an interpretation
(only partially true) of the disastrous defeat
of the Congress in the Andhra Pradesh
elections this time.
