_The social urge represented by the toppling of N T Rama Rao demands
economic and industrial modernisation and development. And for that it
demands efficient and quick-acting governance of the type that has
made men like Pratap Singh Kairon and Sharad Pawar famous. It is
here that NTR is perceived by a substantial segment of Andhra
Pradesh's elite as having failed._

\ 

All political happenings are not significant
events. Whether the toppling of N T Rama
Rao in his ripe old age by a coterie directed
by his own sons-in-law and abetted by his
own sons is an event of any significance is
a point that needs discussion. It can no doubt
be said that it happened at a time when the
man least deserved it --- which is not saying
much, for he has at every point of time
abundantly deserved it --- and for a reason
that carries no great conviction with the
people at large. His dear wife was said to
have been an '_extra-constitutional_ centre of
authority', which means little because all
authority in the Indian polity is in any case
_extra-constitutional_, even when it derives
formal sanction from the Constitution. More
to the point, the old man's son Hari Krishna,
who was a catalyst in the turbulence and has
now become minister for transport in the
son-in-law's cabinet, is as much an _extra-constitutional_
centre of authority as his much-maligned
stepmother, inasmuch as he too
has presumed to dictate the shape of political
happenings in the state without ever having
been elected to the assembly by or in the
name of the people, an act of anointment that
is evidently accepted by common consent
as a good enough entitlement for toppling,
subverting or hijacking governments.

A Hindu coparcenary being what it is, all
property disputes among Hindu families carry
an element of high drama. And castes such
as the _Kammas_ who are substantially
propertied have a community culture in which
this drama is an understood and well
elaborated element. The early Telugu films,
for instance, were in large measure nothing
but the enactment of this familiar drama of
peasant proprietor or landlord families on
the screen, and NTR has acted in quite a few
of them. In most such films the dramatic
d√©nouement begins with the aging of the
patriarch, and is not uncommonly
precipitated by his late infatuation with a
young wife, a foster child _or_ some such
aberration that the heirs regard as senile
delinquency. That by that time the patriarch,
whatever his past acts of despotic authority,
is usually a mellowed man, a silver haired
specimen of contrition, or at least of a certain
desire to make up with all and sundry
--- including the _naxalites_, in NTR's case
--- before quitting this world, generates a certain
sneaking sympathy for him in the onlookers.
And the heirs look even more villainous than
they need to.

It was this drama of painful generational
change in the property holdings of a Hindu
joint family that Andhra Pradesh witnessed
in the last couple of months. But what
made it weird was that the property that
the family was fighting over was the _State
of Andhra Pradesh_ --- its people, politics and
wealth. This itself, perhaps, is its
significance, for Andhra Pradesh is a state
that prides itself on its radical history; it
can justly boast of a significant political
element that is radically critical of the
existing and inherited order of things. That
radical critique can also fairly claim that
it has influenced people's perceptions and
ways of looking at things m major measure.
And yet the inadequacy of this history is
such that a single family --- no doubt a rather
big and glamorous one --- can fight over the
state as its joint property, the way such
families have fought over home and hearth
for centuries in the feudal-patriarchal
tradition. And the people at large, including
the more politically sensitive among them,
are not only not outraged but find it quite
amusing; or else, what is even worse,
dismiss it as an irrelevant interlude in the
grand progress of history.

But it is possible, perhaps, to seek other
points of significance as well. Indeed, one
can even 'rationalise' the events to reveal
a hidden meaning, a rational order disguised
by maverick accidents, an analytical practice
that radical --- especially much of Marxist
--- thinking has always been prone to. For
instance, one may see in the rise and the
crisis of the _Telugu Desam Party_ the birth-pangs
of a self-conscious regional
_bourgeoisie_, its strategies of consolidation
and their crises. Such rationalisation is one
of the most fascinating things about radical
critiques, and contributes a lot to their
enduring attraction --- notwithstanding repeated
practical and predictive failures; but the
fascination is in truth a distraction. Such a
mode of analysis is faulty because what is
filtered out in this process, and (to mix
metaphors) thrown out like the peeled skin
of a fruit is thereby surreptitiously rendered
irrelevant and insignificant. It is usually not,
a point that becomes unpleasantly evident
when what is peeled off analytically to reveal
the alleged rational core returns later --- in
real and not analytical time --- to stick again
to the fruit.

Let us try then to seek a significance of
recent events in AP in as non-rationalising
a way as possible. It is one thing to recognise
order and causation where it exists, and to
recognise human subjectivity in history; but
quite another thing to seek the working out
of a neat pattern of _reason_ acted out by
social collectivities set up as historical
subjects. All such thinking leads to overt or
covert reification of history, which in turn
leads to _utopian_ prescriptions for putting an
end to such history. And all _utopias_ are anti-human,
even the most humane of them.
The human subject --- both as an individual
and as a collective --- is too small to bear the
heavy weight of _utopias_. It can only be
crushed by them. A _non-utopian_ radicalism
requires a non-rationalising mode of analysis;
a mode of seeking truth, for truth must
necessarily be sought, that will accept reason
but will reject _reason_, and will be adequately
cautious in identifying patterns of orderliness
and causation in history, keeping it
always in mind that the history is _human_,
and therefore always carries with it a large
quantity of contingency, in every sense
of that term --- finiteness, disharmony,
incongruence, accident, whimsicality and
so on.

The birth of the _Telugu Desam Party_ 13
years ago was the political consequence of
at least two phenomena. One is the
dissatisfaction felt by a certain section of
Andhra's regional elite with the Congress
Party's strategies in dealing with the
aspirations for political power in the states
and regions. Those sections of the regional
landed-financial-commercial elite that
possessed the advantage of substantial
property, and cohesive homogeneity as well
as a standing of social leadership within the
caste system --- such as the rich among the
_Kammas_ of coastal Andhra Pradesh --- felt
that they deserved more political power than
the Congress was prepared to give them. The
unwillingness of the Congress was due to
many factors, which may not be susceptible
to an ordering in terms of historical
significance or decisiveness. One was the
negative factor that the Congress Party, with
its unitary vision of India, did not like strong
and self-assertive elites to develop in the
states, which in its language would lead to
'fissiparous tendencies'. There were,
however, less negative reasons too. There
was a felt need to accommodate the aspirations
of backward regions and socially weak
communities in the states by allowing their
representatives --- real or putative --- to occupy
positions of power. This meant that the most
powerful regional elites would be to some
extent sidelined, or at least forced to share
power and glory with the less deserving. But
this positive factor contained within it another
negative factor, which has been emphasised
by _Ambedkarite_ analysts. This was that the
Congress, especially at the level of national
politics, was dominated by _brahmins_,
whereas the upcoming regional rich were
from _sudra_ communities, which was one
reason why the Congress expressed a
preference for a unitary structure of the
polity, and encouraged the less dynamic of
the _sudra_ communities, or those from
backward and undeveloped regions within
the states. This process was also congruent
with the sociological fact that in the backward
and undeveloped regions, the unity between
the _brahmin_ and _sudra_ elites as the principal
exploiting groups of pre-modern India has
not been fully shattered, whereas in the
developed regions, that unity had been
breached even by 1947, for both economic
and political-cultural reasons. In Andhra
Pradesh Congress politics, for instance, the
_brahmin_ leadership has had a more or less
cosy relation with the _Reddy_ landlords of
Rayalaseema and Telangana, whereas in
coastal Andhra the _Kamma_ community's
rise, in social and political terms, took place
in an anti-_brahmin_ ambience, represented
explicitly by non-_brahmin_ self-respect type
of movements, and implicitly by the
rationalist, atheist and communist
movements. It was this _Kamma_ community
that developed a very able and talented middle
class and a powerful entrepreneurial elite
taking advantage of the positive material
conditions prevalent in the region watered
by the Krishna and Godavari rivers, which
conditions became even better after the _green
revolution_. And yet, the rise to political
power of this elite commensurate with its
tremendous dynamism was blocked by
Congress strategies.

While the resentment against this denial
was one powerful mood behind the formation
of the _Telugu Desam Party_, there was another
whose contours have become clearer now
than they were at that time. Whatever may
have been true in 1947, by the 1980s, all
the states of India, considered as ethnic-linguistic
regions, had developed an elite
quite capable of taking charge of the affairs
of the region. Today, there is little doubt that
they can fully take command of their regions
and rule them as ably as Delhi is able to rule
India. A person like Chandra Babu Naidu,
the latest chief minister of AP, is equal to
anybody in Delhi, whether in running an
efficient administration, amassing unlawful
wealth or cutting his opponents' throats. He
and his class do not need to be overseen by
Delhi in doing their job. They have nothing
left to learn --- in administration, commerce
or criminality --- from Delhi. India is today
certainly ripe for federalisation, for this if
for no nobler reason. And if a morally
desirable end is actually realised through not
so noble pressures, then that would not be
the first time it has happened in human
history, nor is it going to be the last time.

This pressure of impatience felt by well
grown regional elites has been expressed in
political language in the idiom of
_decentralisation_, _autonomy_, _federalism_, etc.
If it is true that these expressions are not to
be taken literally as the actual aspirations
of all those who talk in terms of them, then
it is also true that they are not to be understood
as mere ideology, in the sense of either a
distorted representation of reality or, worse
still --- a camouflage for hidden material
interests. The notions are just what they are:
the values in terms of which actual aspirations
are conceived, thought of and explained,
following the general principle that in human
thought every particular idea or aspiration
is conceived of and expressed in terms of
universal values, in other words that the
cognitive and the normative are inseparable
in human thought, for human beings cannot
make sense of their existence without making
moral sense of it. Ideological camouflage is
not ruled out here, but that is no more the
essence of the matter than the naive equation
of values with actual aspirations. What is
involved here is a structural property of
human thought, which naturally operates in
a social context.

Once such a universal value comes into
existence it is capable of being taken up
and given fresh content in other aspirations;
of being attached to or reinterpreted in
other contexts so as to give rise to new
aspirations, and energise hitherto dormant
political practices; of becoming part of
social culture that shapes human potential
into actual behaviour patterns; and thence
also of realising itself in social institutions,
social relations and social practices beyond
the intentions and arms of those in whose
aspirations it originally found normative
expression. The notion of ideology --- even
when we grant that 'it is capable of
influencing material reality' --- is not
sufficient to comprehend this important
historical process. This is not to say that
the notion is entirely useless, provided it
is used within the limited space of its utility.

The emergence of self-sufficient elite with
the slogan of _federation_ is frequently
interpreted in terms of the rise of _sub-nationalism_
or _regional nationalism_. Whether
the interpretation is valid in a given case
depends upon the details of that case, and
the underlying rationalisation that ethnic
upsurge is some sort of a law of the
contemporary third world, must be viewed
with suspicion. As far as Andhra Pradesh
is concerned, there has been no rise of
'nationalist' feeling parallel with the change
that we have been describing, for there is
in general no strong feeling of 'Telugu-ness'
comparable with what one finds among the
Tamils and the Bengalis (not to mention the
Kashmiris).

But whether or not an emergent regional
nationalism has coincided in all regions of
the country with the rise of self-assertive
elites, there is one other change which has
taken place. This is an urge that goes beyond
the ruling class of the region and well into
the middle class, to create a fully-fledged
modern community, a well-rounded civil
and political society in the regions, by
structuring the necessary institutions,
conventions and norms. One may call this
a process of the nation in the making, if there
were a nation in the making. It cannot be
assumed to be there, merely because this
urge is there. But even without the self-conscious
notion of a 'nation' (with all the
implied desires of a distinct destiny and
identity), there can be an emergent desire
for a coherently structured modern society
with functioning institutions and respectable
norms of public life, which is both desirable
in itself (and actually desired by many in
the developing community) and a
precondition for the legitimacy of the
governance of the region's elite. The unitary
character of the Indian state, coupled with
its gradual criminalisation has left much to
be desired in this matter. A strong desire to
set this right and to shape a full-fledged
modern society in which every conscious
member of the community may take pride,
and over which the regional elite may
legitimately rule, is a strongly felt idea that
comes through very vocally in the regional
press, academic writings and literature. In
Andhra Pradesh, its strongest and most self-conscious
representative has been the daily
newspaper _Eenadu_, which silently prided
itself on having brought N T Rama Rao to
power in the first instance for this very end,
and which is now no longer even very silent
in claiming credit for having forced his
replacement by his son-in-law, again to the
same end.

_Eenadu_ has not merely reported, but has
taken a political stand while reporting all
major public issues concerning Andhra
Pradesh in recent years. Here are two
instances where its purpose coincided with
larger democratic aspirations. The paper,
over the last two years, has made it impossible
for any government ruling the state to
continue the familiar Indian liquor policy of
making people drink more and more so that
the government may 'balance its budget'. The
paper has also done much to put the
searchlight on warlord violence in the
Rayalaseema districts, and create a reaction
of disgust in the ordinary reader. The plaint
of the warlord politicians of Rayalaseema
that their region's profile has been
deliberately maligned by a coastal Andhra
Pradesh testifies to its success in creating
revulsion.

Both these campaigns no doubt hurt the
Congress, and can easily be interpreted as
part of that paper's anti-Congress politics,
as they frequently are. But going beyond
that, both these campaigns have contributed
to a certain cleansing of public life in the
state, which made them attractive to the
public at large, and contributed to the
regional elite's aspiration for a self-respecting
civil and political society for it
to rule over. NTR was not slow in picking
up the cue. He was not very consistent in
the matter of the political violence of
Rayalaseema, for that violence has always
been loyal only to power and not to any
party, and NTR was not above the
temptation of co-opting it instead of vanquishing
it. In any case, for politicians of
the present generation, the Cuddapah and
Kurnool 'model' of democracy through
bombs and guns offers a tempting alternative
to the tedious business of cajoling
an increasingly cynical electorate. But on
liquor, NTR did not hesitate beyond the
first couple of weeks. He loudly set himself
up as the saviour of the agitating women.

However, the social urge represented by
_Eenadu_' s politics goes beyond this. It
demands economic and industrial
modernisation and development. And for
that it demands efficient and quick acting
governance of the type that has made men
like Pratap Singh Kairon and Sharad Pawar
famous. It has heard of the Bombay-Ahmedabad
industrial corridor and the
throbbing entrepreneurial life of Punjab. The
no-nonsense administrative efficiency that
would appeal to local, national and multinational
capital, and encourage them to
transform Andhra Pradesh in like image, is
a much prized thing in this view, which has
acquired greater force and self-confidence
in the era of Manmohan Singh. This requires,
among other things, a certain mood of
purposeful governance, quick decision-making,
and political balance. It is here that
NTR is perceived, by _Eenadu_ and the
substantial segment of AP's elite that is like-minded
with it, as having failed. This
dissatisfaction of theirs has been evident
from the beginning of his political career.
Like all people driven by purposeful
rationality, these men were upset by the
whimsicality of NTR who is on a perpetual
honeymoon with his own godliness. But
they put up with him until he went and got
himself a wife to whose ambition he was
willing to sacrifice even the stability of the
party and government. The TDP has over
the years struck a balance between the
unquestioned charisma of its undisputed
leader, and the organisational grip of the
elder of his two politically active sons-in-law.
Within the terms set by this balance the
second rank leaders learnt to locate
themselves, assess each other's standing and
evaluate their respective chances of climbing
up the ladder. This knowledge and the
certainty that went with it made for whatever
stability the TDP had, and it was this that
was upset by Lakshmi Parvati --- NTR's second
wife. A woman as greedy, as intelligent, as
able and as ambitious as Chandra Babu
Naidu (and there was no third person in the
party that could match either of them),
she not only gave the son-in-law the jitters,
but completely upset the structure of
opportunities that everybody in the party
understood and related themselves to, in her
effort, as a late-coming aspirant for the
successorship, to create a base for herself
in the party. Naturally, the least valued men
in the party gathered around her and entered
the mansion of power 'through the kitchen'
as Telugu papers contemptuously said. It is
an interesting sidelight that she literally made
the kitchen her headquarters. Indeed, the
whole of Lakshmi Parvati's strategy has
been built around symbols of wifeliness
--- the caring, cooking consort --- which were
meant to create acceptability for her politics
by pretending to be what she was certainly
not: a mere wife. But such is the unhappy
lot of precocious individuals who wish --- for
good or for bad --- to grow out of socially given
roles without questioning the roles and the
attendant expectations.

The expectations, reinforced by a
particularly vicious press led by _Eenadu_,
helped Chandra Babu Naidu and the jittery
party men who had gathered under his
umbrella, frightened by the sudden shaking
of the familiar earth beneath their feet. 1995
has been a year of elections in Andhra
Pradesh. After the assembly elections, the
entire electoral process for the three-tier
_panchayat raj_, the _municipalities_ and the _co-operative
societies_ was gone through with.
At each step, the TDP was shaken by conflicts
over allotment of tickets, with Lakshmi
Parvati patronising candidates of her choice,
who were mainly men who would otherwise
not have stood much chance of breaking
through the established party network to get
tickets for themselves. At the end, when all
the elections were over, the party had come
close to an irremediable division. It only
required the coming together of the two
discordant sons-in-law, blessed by a disloyal
son --- Hari Krishna, and as soon as that unity
was cemented, the legislature party split, and
NTR was dethroned. He made an ass of
himself by parking his favourite campaign
van outside the hotel where the disloyal
legislators were camping and inciting the
policemen present --- who had by that time
guessed which way the wind blew --- to drag
the dissidents from out of the hotel and hand
them over to his lawful custody, such being
his notion of lawfulness. He later made a
further ass of himself by demanding that
the office of governor must be abolished
--- though Krishna Kant had followed the
procedure quite scrupulously --- and that chief
ministers must hereafter be elected directly
like the president of the US so that they may
be undisturbed in their whimsicality for five
full years.

Throughout this terminal combat, _Eenadu_
played a determined role by lampooning
Lakshmi Parvati's ambition, as if she was
the first ambitious politician this state has
seen. It made copious use of the patriarchal
distrust of an ambitious woman who gets
married to a wealthy and powerful old man
whose brain is suspected to have gone soft
of late. This is the acme of vampishness
in a woman, and Lakshmi Parvati was
guilty of this. Nothing more was needed
for a determined campaigner to damn her.

The ruthless campaign is matched by the
man it has brought to power. Chandra Babu
Naidu is a cut-throat politician of current
vintage. He is also ably suited for the role
that _Eenadu_ and the opinion it represents
hope he will play. Like any man who was
born in a four-acres-of-dry-land peasant
family from backward Rayalaseema and
has made for himself umpteen crores by
the time he is 40. he is abundantly endowed
with what capitalism calls _enterprise_. But
going beyond making money for himself
and his cronies, he claims the vision
necessary to structure a modern capitalist
society endowed with the characteristics
required to reproduce itself as a matter of
course. This, as we have said, is one vision
that underlay the rise of the _Telugu Desam
Party_. There is no inevitability of its success,
and no ruse of _reason_ that will work for
its success. All that we can say is that for
the present it has the national and
international climate in its favour, apart
from whatever internal dynamism it has.
But then that climate itself contains much
that may ultimately disfavour or distort it
to suit a different purpose. And the internal
dynamism operates in a specifically third
world environment.

But Andhra politics has always provided
space for other visions, other values that can
inform the process of the formation of a
modern society. These are values of equality,
justice and welfare. Whether these values
are realisable in the absolute sense or not,
they can function as a counterpoint to the
kind of vision that _Eenadu_ and Chandra
Babu Naidu desire, and can drastically
modify the outcome of the ongoing process
of social transformation. It would have helped
if the proponents of the alternative values
understood the radical social model they
visualise as a counterpoint in ideals rather
than the next phase of an ordered History.
But then it is an aspect of unavoidable human
contingency that we have to put up with
radical baggage of the past as much as with
the conservative muck.
