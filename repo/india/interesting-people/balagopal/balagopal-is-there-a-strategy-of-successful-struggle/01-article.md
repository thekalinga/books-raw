The public arena is witness to dispirited discussion of the ineffectiveness of
people’s movements, which are at the most able to slow down things, and nothing
more. The discussion often turns around _violence_ and _non-violence_, not as moral
alternatives but as strategic options. Those who are sick of sitting on _dharna_[^dharna] after
_dharna_ to no effect are looking with some envy at violent options, while many who
have come out of armed groups find the _Namada Bachao Andolan (NBA)_ fascinating.

[^dharna]: Dharna (in India) is the practice of exacting justice or compliance with a just demand by sitting and fasting at the doorstep of an offender until death or until the demand is granted.

It is good that there is some openness in the matter now, for dogmatic attitudes
have done considerable harm. To say that one should not be dogmatic about violence
may be morally a little unsettling, but it is a defensible position even without adopting
a relativistic attitude towards the preciousness of life or a casual attitude towards one’s
moral responsibility for injury caused in the course of a struggle. More of that in the
right context. But the discussion will unavoidably be based on assessments of the
effectiveness of the alternatives, and a distant view is likely to colour the reality with
hopes and assumptions, even illusions. A realistic assessment of what each strategy
has been able to achieve would better inform the debate.

The plain and stark fact is that while all strategies have been effective in curbing
some injustice, none has succeeded in forcing the government to take back a single
major policy in any sphere. And none has been able to reverse the trends inherent in
the structures of society and economy. Yet no serious political movement or social
struggle we know of is only for softening oppression or improving relief. The general
understanding is that governance of the country --- and may be the systemic
infrastructure of society --- is fundamentally wrong and needs remedying, maybe
overturning. Do we know of any effective strategy for that? I am not talking of
political strategies, but strategies of struggle that will successfully put pressure upon
the State and the polity to stop them in their tracks. The struggle may be built around
class or caste or any other social combination. It may in the end seek reform or the
upturning of the polity. It may operate mainly or in part within the polity or keep out of
it altogether. Whichever it is, the common problem is this: the experience of this
country is that governments do not stop doing something merely because it has been
demonstrated to be bad. Or even contrary to constitutional directives and goals. They
stop only if going along is made difficult to the point of near impossibility. No
democratic dispensation should be thus, but Indian democracy is thus. Short of that,
you demonstrate the truth of your critique till you are blue in the face or shout till you
are hoarse in the throat, it is all the same.

This is the question that haunts all movements, and none has an answer. All
strategies --- whether violent or peaceful --- have found that they are not without success, if
by success is meant stemming of local forces of oppression or the local manifestation
of global forces, and improving the situation of its victims at the margin or even more.
One does not wish to belittle these achievements, and in any case its beneficiaries are
grateful, and belittling makes no difference to them. But any attempt to go beyond that
has been faced with an insuperable wall which defines the limits of Indian democracy.

The _naxalites_ --- in particular the largest of them, the _Maoists_ --- are generally
credited with having used strategies of violent struggle to great effect. That they have
had substantial effect on the local social and political structures is beyond doubt. From
Telangana to Bihar, local society would not be what it is but for their effect in turning
much of it upside down. That they have often acted as a very effective deterrent to
knavery and charlatanry of all kinds too is true. But looking back on nearly forty years
of the _naxalite movement_, one is surprised how few are the important policy decisions
of the State or tendencies inherent in the logic of unequal development that the
_naxalites_ have been able to stall. In fact, one cannot off-hand think of even one. They
themselves may answer that it is because they have not tried. It is true that their
strategic thinking does not turn around defeating the State politically but mobilizing
against it militarily. Hence, inflicting major political defeats or reversing trends of
unequal or destructive development is not on their agenda. Yet it is also true that even
if they tried they would not know how to go about stalling such decisions or forces.
To put it simply, you can hold a gun to a landlord’s head but _Special Economic Zones (SEZ)_
or the _Indo-US Nuclear Deal_ have no head to put a gun to. This degree of
simplification of the issue may be criticized as unfair, and one would readily agree
that _Maoist violence_ is not just the armed action of individual _robinhoods_.
Nevertheless, after dressing up this skeleton with sufficient flesh and blood to make it
real, you still do not get away from the basic truth of the caricature.

It is not just the abstractness of these issues that makes violence ineffective as an
option against them. After all they do have concrete manifestations that can be
confronted by violent mobilisation or armed action. But the subtlety of forms of power
other than the feudal makes focused confrontation of a violent kind difficult to
operationalise. Violence may be good or bad, necessary or unnecessary, but it is
always crude. Intelligent exercise of power, on the other hand, is subtle. So is
capitalist rationality, in general. It is sometimes but not always crudely oppressive. It
also comes with promises of a better life for the middle classes and employment for
the poor. It spreads its operational incidents all over and each of them offers its own
rationality. It gives a little and takes a lot, but it gives at one place and takes at another.
It speaks in a dozen tongues, each offering a limited rationality, while the totality is
hidden behind layers or opacity and subterfuge. Its lies require intelligent nailing, and
its logistics requires subtle handling to immobilize it. For in the better kind of
agitational strategy the object of popular mobilisation is to immobilize the opponent,
and that is where violent methods score over peaceful methods. But whom or what do
you immobilize to make an _SEZ_ inoperable?

And then there is the law and its machinery of enforcement. The law of course
does not turn the other way when violent mobilization is used against a landlord or a
local oppressor. But neither are the stakes as high nor is social disapproval so stronger
than as when alleged schemes of "development" or alleged policies of "national security"
are obstructed by violent mobilization. Agitations disrupt normal life, violent
agitations more so. The insecurity and uncertainty this creates can be exploited by the
State to either incite the people against the agitators even to the point of getting them
lynched or to cover up for the violent methods of suppression it employs. It can even
get righteously suppressive. And when the stakes are high, social disapproval can be
engineered beyond its normal levels. We are all aware of how much hatred the State
can generate against agitations --- especially violent ones --- if it believes that its vital
interests are affected. And that can be the justification for lawless enforcement of law,
the more lawless, the more righteous the anger it can whip up in society.

One option then is to throw up one’s hands and say that it is futile to fight an evil
beyond a point while it remains in power. And that the real task is to gain political
power and replace the fount of evil. This makes sense from one angle but misses the
point from another and begs the question from a third. It misses the point because at
one level the question we are posing to ourselves is not about this society or this
polity, but about democracy as such and the amenability of governance to correction
by popular disapproval. To say that we need not spend too much time over this
because we wish to come to power, and then we will not face this problem is no
answer. It begs the question from another angle because if you do not know how to
mobilize people in effective numbers against evil governance, how are you sure you
know how to mobilize them for capture of State power?

Peaceful mobilization has one advantage over violent mobilization. A larger
number of people can participate in it, and it can choose its targets and devise its
methods of agitation more subtly. It gives space for dialogue even while agitation
goes on, dialogue not so much with the establishment as with society, and so the vital
dimension of critique is alive without suspending the agitation to clear space for it,
and this is essential in any struggle against an opponent who operates in a universe of
intelligent rationality. This is one reason why peaceful methods of struggle are not
only morally but also politically healthier. But in terms of its effectiveness in
reversing policy decisions or structural trends, peaceful methods are even more
ineffective than violent methods. Quite plainly, _dharnas_ and street plays and _hartals_
and half-an-hour-at-a-time road blocks and street corner speeches and _jathas_ can go on
for ever and ever and neither the State nor the Ambanis lose anything. This is what
often makes activists cynical and gives them that urge to seek an appointment with the
_Maoists_. When they are so tempted they think the only problem they have had with
violence is that it is morally problematic and physically unsafe. It is assumed that it is
necessarily more effective. It isn’t, and it has not been.

Can we turn to the law to make governance answerable to popular disapproval
other than at election time? _Constitutional democracy_ as we know it in India gives
little scope for such a hope but _PILs_ have held a lot of fascination for activists. Much
of it is born of out of ignorance of the law as much as the _sociology of adjudication_.
The average intelligent Indian thinks of _PIL_ as the modern equivalent of the bell
which the better kind of king is reputed to have strung outside his palace for the
desperate citizen to tug at and get an instant hearing and instant justice. The average
intelligent Indian also thinks that all the limitations of judicial power that he or she is
otherwise familiar with vanish when the Courts sit to hear _PILs_, namely that they
become _benign despots_ who can set every wrong right by passing a condign order.
Desperation can be the only reason for these illusions. Less excusable is the ignorance
of the _sociology of adjudication_. Judges, taken as a class, are at one with most of the
political and economic tendencies since liberalisation for no more subtle reason than
that they belong to the social class that has benefited and will benefit much more from
these tendencies. Extremely derisive comments about _PILs_ are made with juvenile
exuberance by the Supreme Court these days to send out a signal that the activist or
desperate citizen need not take the trouble to go all the way to New Delhi. Law
journals report some divergence of opinion and even snide comments about judicial
activism in the Supreme Court, but the divergence is between _conservative judicial
activism_ and _conservative aversion_ to it.

There is no option but to devise ways of stopping the system in its depredations.
Since Indian democracy has not learnt to respect reasoned criticism unless it is armed
with the strength to physically prevent the execution of the policies criticized, ways of
achieving such strength must be sought by agitational movements. In principle the
best method is to mobilize the people likely to be affected in large numbers and
physically sit in the path of the State and Capital. But then the people in their
concreteness are riven by diversity of interests and insularity of communities, crushed
by poverty and misery, weakened by the disease of opportunism even at the lowest
levels which has been the greatest contribution of the Congress party to Indian
political culture, enfeebled by attachment to their political patrons, and disillusioned
with empty rhetoric and moral corruption of agitations and movements. In particular,
they see that activists who were in an earlier generation characterized by sacrifice of
personal concerns are no longer the same. To my mind, this is the greatest disservice
done by the NGOs, but this culture is now common to a large section of political
activists, too. On the other hand, the very effect of politicization has been that the
people have lost their innocence and often weigh the costs and benefits of struggle
with greater caution than in the past. One cannot blame them, especially when the
caution is reinforced by the fact that activists themselves exhibit the same attitude
these days. All this combines to make strong mobilisation difficult and tempts honest
activists to look for shortcuts, ranging from armed action to _PILs_. But there are no
shortcuts.
