The _rights movement_ in India has plenty of experience today. It has studied the
repressive apparatus of the Indian State in all its varied forms and contexts. It has seen and
documented the havoc wrought by the disease of communalism on social relations and the
life-situation of minorities. It has catalogued violence on socially disadvantaged sections of
the population and the systematic deprivation they suffer. It has commented on the
displacement and the ecological devastation that have come in the wake of "development". It
has campaigned for better laws and for the repeal of oppressive laws. It has demanded
justice from the institutions of democracy and unsparingly condemned their injustices.
And today it is busy documenting the devastation neo-liberalism is bringing upon the
people.

It has done everything except ask itself what it is doing, and why.

Today the agenda of the _rights movement_ is so broad that it is forced to stop and ask
itself where its borders stop and where the territory of political struggles begins. What
exactly distinguishes it from other movements --- more explicitly political --- which also ask for
the same rights and also protest the same deprivations? What exactly is its specific role,
over and above the role the other political or mass movements play? What exactly does it
do when, for instance, it talks about deprivation of workers' rights which cannot be done by
trade unions? Is its work then confined to areas and situations where there are no unions,
and if so, does the _rights movement_ stop talking about workers' rights the moment the
hypothetical point is reached where all the workers are unionised? And the same questions
can be posed about the rights of Women, _Dalits_ and Minorities, too.

There was little scope for such doubts so long as the _rights movement_ confined itself
to police atrocities and repression on political movements. It is with those issues that the
_rights movement_ as we know it today started its activity in our country. Since it is almost
alone in espousing those issues --- the issues of civil and political rights, pure and simple --- it
has no competition and therefore no need to explain the _raison d'être_ of its existence and
activity. There are many in the _rights movement_ who believe that the movement should
have stuck to such concerns only and should not have presumed to widen its scope and
trench upon the activity of other political movements, for in that realm it is (they say)
superfluous even when not ineffectual.

All the political movements of the deprived and the oppressed, whatever their politics
and whatever their form, are in a sense movement for rights, and many of them are quite
substantial in their strength and spread. But the _rights movement_ _as such_, constituted by
the various civil, democratic and human rights organisations, is numerically slight and
scattered in its spread. Why should it presume to duplicate the work of bigger and better
organised _Dalit_, Women's, _Adivasis_ and Workers' organisations?

The only possible answer to this question lies in recognising that a _right_ has a
civilisational significance over and above the gap it fills in the existence of the people who
demand it at a given point of time. This is by no means to suggest that such people
invariably and inevitably construe the rights they demand as narrow needs and not as
values. Sometimes they do, and we seem to be going through a phase of history when such
narrowness is more than typical. But it need not be so, and is not always so. Nevertheless,
there is a distinct task of the espousal of a _right_ as a civilisational value over and above the
immediate demands that it is articulated to. Such espousal, to begin with, makes the value
in question an element of social consciousness in general. From there it can be articulated
to other needs and situations not dreamt of by the people whose struggle gave rise to it in
the first place.

The _Dalit movement_, in its emphasis on the equal worth of all human beings, stresses
a norm without which civilisation can hardly be complete --- in India or any where. Only, it
took a people systematically denied worth to recognise that such a principle underlies any
respect-worthy notion of civilisation. Babasaheb Ambedkar encapsulated it in his
memorable formula --- _one man one value_. It took a dalit to formulate it in such terse
language, but once it is so formulated it is easily identified as a principle whose reach goes
well beyond the movement for the _annihilation of caste_. To take it beyond and help its
reproduction in other relevant contexts is a task in itself.

The women's movement has focussed, among other things, on authority and power
in inter-personal relations, and in human relations in general. That women are subjected to
such authority and power every moment of their existence makes it apt that the questioning
of authority as a human relation should come from the women's movement, but once it is
made explicit, it ceases to be a matter of concern for women alone and becomes a matter of
general concern for any democratic definition of _civilisation_. It lights a torch that will
thenceforth look at every realm of human existence to ferret out symptoms of power.

Indeed, even when the _rights movement_ was concerned exclusively about police
atrocities on militant political movements and citizens in general, it was in fact holding up
certain values and norms as definitive of civilised existence. That is not the way the
movements and the persons that suffer the repression see it, and the _rights movement_ too
may never have put it in those words. But nevertheless that is what it has been doing. Why
indeed should the police not kill a revolutionary? The answer cannot be that the law says so,
because the law may well say something else tomorrow. Indeed, it already says something
else in the guise of the various _Armed Forces (Special Powers) Acts_. Nor can the answer be
that the lives of revolutionaries are precious, because that would mean that others could be
killed by the police, and in any case we all know that your revolutionary may well be my
terrorist. Nor, finally, could it be said that what is being objected to is only the taking of life
by the police of _this_ State --- which is a State of the oppressors --- and nothing more. Such a
reply would leave open the possibility that in a different State, the _rights movement_ may
well be found defending police violence, and why should anyone then heed the high moral
tone of is critique of _this_ State?

The only answer can be that there is something inherently valuable and precious
about human life that will not countenance its cavalier deprivation. Whether that means
that human life can never be taken by anyone under any circumstances is a very difficult
question to answer, but that does not gainsay that it is the inherent value of _life_ as a
civilisational principle that lies at the root of opposition to gun wielding policemen being
judges and executioners of citizens.

We are looking here at a trait peculiar to human consciousness. There would have
been no notion of rights _as such_ but only needs and wants if human consciousness did not
possess the trait. It is that we can never think of a particular injustice without postulating a
universal norm of justice. This is the anthropology of the notion of rights. We can never
express a particular grievance without invoking a general norm of good and bad. A hungry
person will not forever be content --- unless hunger has rendered him excessively timid
--- pleading that since he has no food and others have more than they need, the others may
kindly share it with him. He will start saying at some point that it is unjust that they do not.
Nor can he merely say: 'it is unjust that I should go hungry when you people have enough
food and more'. He must say: 'it is unjust that anyone should go hungry when others have
more food than they need, and therefore the hungry one has a _right_ to the extra food'. His
need for food gives rise to a general principle which says that it is contrary to the notion of
_rights_ that some people are condemned to go hungry when there is food enough for all.
This principle obviously outlives the satiation of his hunger and extends to needs other
than food, too.

Thus there is a process of continuous generalisation of _needs_ and _entitlements_ into
_rights_, which process expresses itself in the universal language of _justice_. The _rights
movement_ lives in this realm. Indeed, all political movements of a democratic character do
live here to some extent, but the _rights movement_ dwells here predominantly if not
exclusively. Its effective functioning in this realm can contribute a lot to civilisation.
Recognising the general principles emanating from each just aspiration, articulating them
to other contexts and situations and thereby weaving a garment of rights, working for their
spread in social consciousness and their institutionalisation in social and State institutions,
and agitating for the protection and implementation of the institutionalised rights is the
realm of activity of the _rights movement_. This is what, indeed, it has been doing all along,
but the radical political philosophy that most rights activists in our country espouse has
inhibited its expression, since this way of expressing it would sound suspiciously 'idealistic'
to such a view point.

There are, broadly, three sources from which we have received the civilisational
norms that constitute rights as we understand them today. One is the western democratic
tradition that is characterised by the affirmation of a number of civil and political rights as
inviolable rights of citizens vis-à-vis the State. (I refer here to the genuine rights and not the
so-called 'right' to unequal privileges such as property). It may be that this characteristic of
modern western civilisation is not owed to the liberal humanism that it claims as its
particular contribution to human thought, but rather it alone needed to define these rights
of citizens, since other societies were not burdened by a State as all-encompassing as the
modern western State, and therefore did not need to define these rights. This is not the
occasion to express any view one way or another on this difficult dispute --- there is much to
be said on both sides, as the _cliché_ goes - but the fact is that the State today is everywhere
modeled on the modern western State, and hence willy-nilly the rights of the liberal
tradition are instrumentally valuable for all of us, and the principle of inviolability of the
person by structures of power --- political or otherwise --- goes beyond instrumental utility.

The _rights movement_ recognises and condemns the crass hypocrisy that has often
accompanied the celebration of these rights in the western tradition, of which the most
central is the pretence that civil and political liberties can be equally enjoyed without
reference to one's social-economic status and entitlements. But neither that nor the
possibility that the rulers of those societies hoped that the rights would act as palliative for
the people denied substantive livelihood rights is as central for the _rights movement_ as
their positive meaning as rights of the person _vis-à-vis_ power structures. Hypocrisy must be
unequivocally exposed, and the people should be educated not to accept civil and political
rights as a substitute for livelihood rights, but rather cherish the former in themselves and
also use them as instruments for realising the latter, which in any case they do day in and
day out. But the _rights movement_ should be clear about the civilisational significance of the
civil liberties of liberal humanism and its duty in keeping them alive in social thought and
institutions. This should be difficult only for that brand of radicalism that believes that the
hypocrisy and the palliation are not contingent matters but the essence of liberal
humanism, and therefore the more we work for their realisation in social consciousness
and institutions the more we will serve the hegemonic purposes of the Capitalist State. For
such a radicalism, it is obvious, the _rights movement_ as we know it today is itself an
ideological charade, and therefore it cannot possibly inform the movement's world view. It
is, however, a striking paradox of the _rights movement_ of India that perhaps a majority of
its activists owe political allegiance to such a radicalism. This is the main reason why it has
been reluctant to theorise its activity.

The second tradition arises from the running critique --- expressed not only in
debating halls but in the form of very painful struggles --- of the inherent limitations of the
rights of liberal humanism and its hypocrisy in practice. The hypocrisy has had its apogee
in the direct and indirect wars waged by the US all over the world in the last fifty years in
the service of 'democracy' and 'human rights', but it has an old history. The limitations, of
course, were obvious from the outset. The privileging of civil and political rights over the
basic livelihood rights --- the US to this day takes the stand that livelihood rights are not
rights as such but a matter of policy within the discretion of the decision-makers of the
society in question --- has been questioned almost from the beginning of the era of
liberalism. Women, workers and other labouring poor, racial minorities and colonised
people questioned and continue to question the lopsided understanding of democracy and
_rights_ within the liberal tradition, and the further grotesque form neo-liberal arrogance is
reducing it to. The critique took organised form in diverse political movements, of which
the socialist movement was the most successful. The debate between liberalism and its
socialist critique had some fruitful consequences, and the United Nations, for instance, was
impelled to prepare a charter of livelihood rights in the teeth of opposition from the US,
but in the cold war period the debate was reduced to a grotesque caricature, with each side
reducing the other's position to meaningless absurdities. The _rights movement_ is yet to
recover from the ill-effects of this era. But the more fruitful moments of the debate have
postulated a number of principles constitutive of civilisation worth the name. They cannot
be reduced to but can be briefly summed up by saying that all human beings, as individuals
and collectivities, are entitled to all the freedom, the opportunities and the material
entitlements that will enable them to grow and develop as completely as the current stage of
material civilisation will allow. This is without prejudice to the possibility that humanity
may well decide to restrict the degree of material development it will permit itself in the
interests of the survival of its habitat and its progeny.

The third tradition is derived from the history and politics of India. Caste and caste
ideology --- _Brahminism_ - is of course a form of oppression peculiar to India. The opposition
to it is as old as the middle of the first millennium BC, and has centrally upheld the notion of
equal human _worth_, which is not reducible to equal material entitlements or equal political
rights. That struggle goes on to this day, for caste Hindu society is reluctant to do any thing
more than pay lip service to that notion. Moreover, the privileging of some people/classes
in the matter of worth is not confined to the institution of caste, nor is it confined to India.
In that sense, the emphasis on equal _human worth_ is a civilisational contribution that the
anti-caste movement has made.

But that is not the only contribution our understanding of rights gains from Indian
history and politics. Ours is a country subjected to colonial/neo-colonial domination, and a
plural society proclaiming the possibility of living and thriving as such. This experience and
the struggles it has forced upon us has taught us many values that inform our
understanding of rights. And it appears that it is these two struggles that confront us as
immediate political tasks today. All the values that we have learnt from the history of other
people must today be integrated with the lessons our own history has taught us in this
regard to create a rights consciousness and rights bearing institutions that will assist this
process.

I am aware that there is a point of view which says that the exclusive emphasis on
rights is itself an individualist western notion, and that it is not conducive to the humane
life that should be the goal of democratic struggles. Rights, in this view, should be
intertwined with the obligations that bind people on the basis of mutuality. This view
proceeds on the assumption that rights are necessarily individualist, and are generally
opposed to associated existence. It also, in its extreme formulations, supposes that an ideal
collectivity requires no rights for individuals against the collectivity. These are easily shown
to be untenable assumptions, but that would take us well beyond the scope of the present
article. However, two things need to be said and they should suffice for the present.

One, an idea is not necessarily wrong because it is _western_ in its origin. It should not
have been necessary to say this, except that a number of people who do not belong to the
_Viswa Hindu Parishad_ talk as if describing something as _western_ self-evidently makes it
oppressive/undemocratic. While there can be no doubt that the excessive individualism
that characterises the more negative aspects of modern western life is undesirable in the
extreme, the recognition given to the rights and entitlements of human beings as
_individuals_ is a very positive contribution made by the western democratic revolution to
human civilisation. The submergence of the individual in a supra-individual collectivity
such as the State, community, caste or family may not be as abhorrent to every point of
view as to the liberal, but it must nevertheless be recognised that it can oppress the
individual's development and self-realisation unless the collectivity is very egalitarian ---
which is rarely the case. Moreover, unless we confine the discourse of rights within the
liberal framework, all rights do not enhance individualism in society. Many of them, even if
they endow individuals with rights, are defined in terms of a collectivity, and make sense
only for a collectivity. This is true of a range of rights from the right to food and
employment to the right to a clean environment. In fact, even the very 'liberal' rights of free
speech, association and self-determination are collective rights, rights necessary for any
shared existence. But it is equally essential to endow individuals with rights _against_ every
collectivity, even the most benign collectivity, if the collectivity is not to oppress the
individual.

Two, the characterisation of rights made above is not predicated on any particular
way of ordering society, provided only it is not inimical to the realisation and enjoyment of
the rights. After the experience of twentieth century experiments at building an alternative
to capitalism, I do not think it is possible to be dogmatic about alternatives. Hopefully,
society based on mutuality and sharing will be possible. But the notion of rights cannot be
predicated upon any utopian model for the future.
