_It is a characteristic of the land grant bonanza that has overtaken
the country in the era of double digit growth that nobody is asking
why industrial or house-building concerns need all the land they
are being granted. The phenomenon is virulent in Andhra Pradesh.
The second in a three-part article._

Singur and Nandigram have focused
attention on the undesirability of
land acquisition for industrial purposes
in fertile areas, which are often
multi-cropped land. It has been suggested
that grant of land of poor quality
or _wasteland_ to industries is un-problematic,
and will put useless expanses to good
use while protecting agriculture and the
farmers.

While acquisition of fertile lands for
industrial uses undoubtedly causes heartburn
in the farmers and is even otherwise
a serious issue by itself, the alternative
suggested is based on more than one fallacy.
The first fallacy is that there is any
waste land at all in India except in the
revenue records. This is not meant in the
ecological sense in which every bit of
nature is part of a whole and you cannot
remove one bit without affecting the rest.
The concern is much more immediate.
India is not so rich that any part of nature
will be allowed to remain unused. People
use every bit of nature, and every time
you hear a government say that a certain
expanse of unused government land has
been made over to some company, you
can be sure there are hundreds if not
thousands of people whose needs have
been slighted by default. It would, however,
be a further fallacy to assume that
all such use is desperate in nature and
born of abject poverty.

There is the systematic use too, such
as the use of coasts (a typical instance of
"_wasteland_" belonging in law to the
govern-ment and controlled by coastal
regulations) by fishing communities for
berthing their boats, drying their nets,
trading their catch and repairing their
implements. Or the use of rock-filled
"_wastelands_" of the Deccan by stone
quarrying communities (it is the caste
occupation of some of the most backward
and hardy people) to make a living for
themselves by quarrying for the building
industry. And so on.

The second fallacy is to equate the
farmers' agitation against acquisition of
arable land with the agricultural economists'
concern with loss of farm produce. The
latter stresses the undesirability of loss of
multi-cropped land, whereas for the
farmer whose land is taken away the land
is the only source of livelihood, whether
it gives two crops or one or just a notional
crop. The wisdom one has heard
from a range of persons from Sonia
Gandhi to M S Swaminathan, that multicropped
land should be exempted from
acquisition, would make no sense whatever
to the farmers. If anything, the
compensation that fertile land would bring
may provide alternative livelihood to the
land-loser, whereas the compensation
given to poor quality land would provide
none. Ask the farmers of arid lands and
they would say the opposite of these wise
persons: acquire multi-cropped land because
its market value is higher and the
dispossessed landowner can live on the
compensation, but spare us please. At this
point a lot of people will get angry and
ask whether India needs to industrialise
or not, as chief ministers hungry for investments
have been asking. As of now
I am not saying anything on that except
to point out that if we take livelihoods
seriously, land grant to industries is much
more problematic than the crop productivity
vs industrial growth debate would
indicate.

The third fallacy is the assumption that
the kind of land grants industries are asking
for these days can be met exclusively
from arid or _wastelands_. _Rule 5(2)_
of the central rules under the _Special
Economic Zones (_SEZ_) Act_ wants that
land granted to an _SEZ_ must be contiguous,
and developers who have the money
to invest are asking for nothing less than
10,000 acres, though the rules permit
smaller _SEZs_, for they have big money
and want to make bigger money. Even
_non-SEZ_ land grants are huge in size
because unlike in the past when an industrialist
would be satisfied if he got
land for the factory site from the government,
in the era of pampered enterprise
they want land for whole townships,
complete with not only residential quarters
for their permanent staff, but clubs and
parks for the _sahibs_ too. And where in
India outside the _Thar_ desert do you get
such huge expanses of wholly waste or
arid land unbroken by irrigated land? If
you do, it will be in some godforsaken
wilderness, but our pushy entrepreneurs
want lands as close as possible to a four-lane
highway, electrified railway line,
shipping harbour, airport and a metropolitan
city if possible, so that they may
while away their evenings the better.

That the focus of debate in the country
has been on the undesirability of acquisition
of fertile land for industries is a
circumstance that has helped governments
to get away with grants of huge tracts of
land described as "_wasteland_ where nothing
grows and which no one owns". Part
of the claim is patently dishonest, for
private lands which yield good income
for the farmers are often described as land
of poor quality while approving their
acquisition for industrial uses. But in most
cases the revenue records do show the
land to be _wasteland_, and therefore presumed
to be unused, but the reality is
starkly otherwise.

A well publicised example is the land
sought to be given by the government of
Orissa to the iron and steel project of
_Pohang Steel Co (POSCO)_ in Jagatsinghpur
district. Out of the 4,004 acres to be
handed over to the project (it is kept
deliberately vague whether this is the
whole of the land grant or only its first
phase), 3,566 acres are declared to be
government land, by implication uncultivated
and nobody's personal property. It
is in part forest land and in part revenue
land. Far from being unused, almost the
whole of it bears betel vines and cashew
fruit trees, on which the landless families
of three gram panchayats, Gadkujang,
Dhinkia and Nuvagaon, have been living
for decades. They were entitled to have
their rights officially recognised under the
_Orissa Prevention of Land Encroachment
Act, 1972_ which permits regularisation of
occupation of revenue land by the landless
poor up to one acre per family, and the
recently passed _Scheduled Tribes and
Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition
of Forest rights) Act, 2006_ which
mandates regularisation of usufructory
rights enjoyed from prior to December
13, 2005 in the forests, including _reserve
forests_, by not only _scheduled tribes_ but
others too, provided (in the case of the
others) they have been living there for
three generations.

The people of the three villages are
clearly entitled to the protection of these
legal provisions, but the government of
Orissa will not tell them they have these
rights. Instead, it treats the land in their
occupation as its own unused and unusable
property, which can be assigned to
factory sites at will. The people of the
three villages, unwilling to give up the
land that gives them substantial livelihoods,
have barricaded the nine roads that lead
to the area and are ready to battle it out.
Even in the narrow eyes of the law they
are not encroachers coming in the way
of development but occupiers having the
right of regularisation, and whatever follows
from that. What follows, indeed, is
the other half of the issue, of which more
below. But middle class Orissa's view of
them as a nuisance that comes between
it and paradise is baseless even in the
narrowest view.

Andhra Pradesh has its Jagatsinghpurs.
The grant of first 10,760 acres and then
another 4,000 acres to a certain Janardhan
Reddy --- an MLC of the BJP from Bellary
in Karnataka --- to set up a steel plant near
Jammalamadugu in Cuddapah district of
Rayalaseema has attracted a lot of attention.
This is because the _Telugu Desam Party_
has been campaigning against the favour
shown to this one entrepreneur to the
exclusion of others (including Telugu
Desam men, it is needless to add) who
may be equally interested. But that is not
our story. Our story is centred on the land
granted to the _Brahmani Steels_, the industrial
unit that is to come up there. The
government said it was all _wasteland_
belonging to it and hence there will be
no question of any forcible land acquisition.
The first question is the extent: after
announcing that 10,000 odd acres would
be given for the plant, another 4,000 was
added on because the company wanted
"to build an air strip", according to press
reports. That extent of land for what will
practically be a captive airport is outrageous.
But such liberality is not peculiar to the
_Brahmani Steels_. It is a characteristic of
the land grant bonanza that has overtaken
the country in the era of double digit
growth that nobody is asking why industrial
or house-building concerns need all the
land they are being granted. The value of
the land may not be much today, and may
be notional if it is government land, which
makes it possible to dismiss such queries
as nit-picking, but once industry comes
up, the land surrounding it will appreciate
considerably in value, and can be the
nucleus of a profitable real estate business
that has nothing to do with the stated
purpose of the land grant. If the area is
close enough to a metropolis, it may well
turn out to be in fact the actual and not a
subsidiary purpose of the whole affair.

The second concern is that the so-called
_wasteland_ is in no sense a "waste". There
is a hamlet called Chitimitichintala of
about 200 houses located in the land,
peopled by _Sugalis_ (called _lambadas_ in
telangana and _banjaras_ in central India).
The _Sugalis_ are recognised as a _Scheduled
Tribe_ in Andhra Pradesh. The _Sugalis_ of
Chitimitichintala are cultivating about 450
acres of the land now given to _Brahmani
Steels_. Part of this land (though its legal
status is not very clear) appears to belong
to a _Shrotriyam_, a kind of land grant
given to brahmins in the past. All such
superior or special rights in land have
been abolished after independence, and
the lands have been settled in favour of
persons (including the superior landholders
themselves) who showed some evidence
of having cultivated or occupied them in
the past with the permission of the landholder.
The _Sugalis_ too should have got
legal title to the land under their cultivation,
but they made no effort to claim the
legal rights, which they did not know they
had and the government did not care to tell
them of. They remain therefore encroachers
on what is by default government land.
But even if it is government land and
they are encroachers, being encroachers
of long standing and landless poor to boot,
they are entitled to regularisation of their
occupation under the _Board of Revenue
Standing Orders_ inherited by Andhra
Pradesh from the old Madras state. Since
the government did not care to do that,
they remain encroachers who are presumptuously
questioning Andhra Pradesh
chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy's
gift to Rayalaseema.

The story does not end here. The entire
land, and not just these 450 acres has
provided the _Sugalis_ with substantial
livelihood. It is a scrub forest and provides
forest produce of various kinds, which
they consume or sell. The land is located
at an elevation and is good pasture land
too. In the monsoons, the cattle of neighbouring
low-lying lands of the _Penna_
river basin villages of Cuddapah and
Kurnool districts find grazing difficult in
the water-logged lands, and their owners
therefore bring them to these uplands and
hand them over to the custody of the
_Sugalis_, who graze them at the charge of
Rs 30 per animal per month. Tens of
thousands of cattle are grazed by them
each monsoon season. It is a great facility
for the _Sugalis_ as well as the farmers of
the neighbouring low-lying areas stretching
quite far off. Yet, the ideology of
development calls the land "_wasteland_",
and is impatient with talk of the livelihood
it has provided to the local people. The
_Sugalis_ are agitating vigorously, though
they will not try blockading the _Brahmani
Steels_ a la the _anti-POSCO_ agitation, since
the Andhra Pradesh police are not the
Orissa police. Any blockade will be
smashed in a couple of hours and every
man, woman and child jailed. Yet they
are determined to obstruct the work till
their grievance is heard.

Impatient people will ask what kind of
compensation can be given for the fodder
lost by nameless cattle and all that, but
a few more points need to be made before
we go on to that. In almost all cases where
the victims of forcible land acquisition
oppose takeover of their land, they point
to some alternative and try to make out
a case that it is better even for the stated
purpose of the acquisition to take that
land rather than theirs. The enquiry under
_Sec 5-A_ of the _Land Acquisition Act, 1894_
is in part meant for considering such
suggestions. Not only governments but
all the proponents of quick development
are usually impatient with such suggestions,
which in their view is the presumptuous
advice of ignorant peasants. In
Andhra Pradesh the government has institutionalised
this impatience by routinely
invoking the urgency clause in
_Sec 17_ and dispensing with the _Sec 5-A_
enquiry. But in fact a lot of politics goes
into selection of the site to be acquired,
except where purely technical considerations
decide.

If the land to be acquired is identified
by some bureaucrat or engineer closeted
in his office and inadvertently includes
the land of the politically influential, they
can and do get the site shifted, and it is
only after this operation is done as many
times as the well-heeled are affected that
the final proposal, which has the bogus
air of a dispassionately and expertly
drafted document, comes out. The ones
who avoid takeover of their land kill two
birds with one stone: they save their land
and ensure that its value goes up because
the project will come up in some neighbouring
land.

The most notorious such instance is
land acquisition around Hyderabad for a
monstrosity called the _outer ring road_, a
500 feet wide eight-lane highway that is
to run around Hyderabad at a distance of
30 to 40 kilometres. Maybe Hyderabad
will need such a highway in the future
and maybe it will not, but the project is
a sure prescription for pushing up land
values all around the city. The trick then
has been to buy land in the periphery of
the city by spreading the rumour that there
is going to be compulsory land acquisition
for the road and the small landholders
cannot afford the litigation needed to get
a good price, and so they had better move
out early by selling it to the financially able.
Once you buy land, or if you have land
in the area from the beginning, ensuring
that the road goes near but not through
your land is the next step. Thus the alignment
of the outer ring road has been
changed again and again and has finally
ended in the lands of the most voiceless.

Hyderabad did not give much trouble
to the government on this score but a
similar game played out with the port-based
_SEZ_ at Kakinada has called up the
stiffest resistance to land acquisition for
_SEZs_ in this state as of now. An _SEZ_ of
extent 9,869 acres meant for the ONGC's
oil refineries was planned near Kakinada,
the head-quarters of the prosperous district
of East Godavari.

The initial site was near that sizeable
town, but in paddy fields. The farmers
protested relying on the familiar argument
of loss of _double-cropped land_. But it was
the real estate businessmen whose opposition
finally mattered. Kakinada was
bound to grow with the _SEZ_, and if the
_SEZ_ could be pushed some distance away,
this land surrounding the town would be
gold. So it happened that the land acquisition
for the _SEZ_ was pushed back to
rural areas of Uppada Kothapalli and
Tondangi _mandals_, some distance from
Kakinada, parallel to the sea-coast but
some distance inland. Since the argument
of avoiding acquisition of _double-cropped
land_ was the official _raison d'être_ of the
change, the land now to be acquired was
described as land of _poor quality_. This
has enraged the residents of the villages
now to be acquired. There are in fact
plenty of coconut, cashew and casuarina
groves on the land. The sea-coast is the
home of fishing communities, and while
the _SEZ_ will come up some distance in
the interior, in deference to coastal regulations,
the chemical pollution that comes
with refineries, the fisherfolk apprehend,
will pollute the streams that flow into the
sea and kill fish.

More importantly, the villagers know
that their lands have been chosen because
real estate dealers of Kakinada managed
to get the first choice dropped. They resisted
the survey of the lands effectively
for months, but on September 6 this year
a huge force of hundreds of armed policemen
raided the villages of Srirampuram,
Rayavaripodu, Mummidivaripodu, Ramaraghavapuram
and Katurivaripalem,
arrested all the leaders of the agitation,
beat up the women who came in the way
and stood guard while the survey team
finished its job. If each stage of the land
acquisition is to be completed by such
means, there could well be bloodshed on
a day when the people are more determined
and less unprepared.

The resistance to industrial land acquisition
has raised a whole debate about the
very propriety and justification of the
power of _compulsory land acquisition_.
But the people themselves resist it for the
plain reason that every land acquisition
leaves the displaced people much poorer,
even as it hopefully leaves the country's
GDP richer, because India does not have
even the semblance of a _fair and just
compensation and rehabilitation policy_.
Owners of immovable property (mainly
land and houses) get a notional market
value of the property as compensation,
which is considerably less than the actual
cost of the property because the officially
recognised market value is based
on the rate at which land transactions are
registered, and properties are undervalued
in registration to reduce the stamp duty.
Litigation is of course an option available
for increasing the compensation but so
many hands dip into the till --- middlemen
of all kinds, lawyers and sometimes
judges too --- that it is often an illusory
option. And those who do not have title
to the resources they live on get no compensation
under any law. What they do
get is a lot of promises, which these days
take the form of policy pronouncements
which do not survive the displaced persons'
assent to the ouster.

# _SEZ_ in Chittoor District

The first _SEZ_ to be approved in Andhra
Pradesh was an extent of slightly more
than 12,000 acres covering 16 villages
with total population of about 25,000 in
Satyavedu and Varadayyapalem _mandals_
of Chittoor district. The big landholders
were promised compensation of Rs 2½
to 3 lakhs per acre rather than the notional
market value, and the others were sought
to be persuaded by promises of jobs,
alternative lands, rehabilitation in a properly
constructed colony, etc. Most people
doubted the promises but were not unamenable
to persuasion by smooth talking
officers, but there were two angry villages
that refused to be taken in. These are
Tonduru Society and Sriharikota Colony.
They are wiser because they have been
there before. They had left their original
habitation in Nellore district in 1972 to
make way for the _Indian Space Research
Organisation_'s centre at Sriharikota, which
is frequently in the news for India's
achievements in that realm of technology.
They are 274 families in total, about half
of them _dalits_. At that time they left
without demur partly because nobody
talked against displacement in those days,
partly perhaps for the greater glory of the
nation, but mainly because they were
promised five acres of cultivable land,
one job per family (in a space research
centre) and a nicely built colony. Nobody
got a job, the land they got was not five
acres but 2½ acres --- not cultivable land
but wild bushes in snake-infested country
--- and even that was not given with full
title but in the name of a cooperative
society. As for the promise of a rehabilitation
colony, what they got was a mere
house-site each, where they had to put up
their own huts. It took them quite a few
years to climb back to the standard of
living they had lost, and so they know
what _displacement_ means.

This is the situation everywhere, and
this is why people are opposed to land
acquisition in the name of "development".
The poor who depend for livelihood on
public land have to just leave it and move.
They may be cultivating it without any
title, or on assignment or lease from the
government, or they may be grazing sheep,
quarrying stone, tapping _palm toddy_,
catching fish in water sources, etc., on the
land. Those who labour on the land of
others also have to move, leaving whatever
security that livelihood provided them
with. In caste-divided India, each of these
is often the occupation of a particular caste,
or predominantly of a caste, as agricultural
labour is that of _dalits_. The general
disability imposed by caste, that the skill
and instruments of other vocations are not
easily accessible, adds to the universal
woes of forcible dispossession and displacement.
There is no uniform and binding
right of compensation/rehabilitation
for all such project affected persons, as
they are called these days, in India. The
various state governments either ignore
the issue, or pull out whimsical policies
to meet the exigencies of tricky situations
arising from determined opposition.

This opposition has led to a lot of
discussion on the very power of land
acquisition. But the discussion has confounded
a lot of things. The power of
compulsory land acquisition for a public
purpose, the _Land Acquisition Act, 1894_
(usually described in horrified tones as "a
piece of colonial legislation", as if much
Indian law is not of colonial vintage), and
the principle of "_eminent domain_" have
been mixed up quite thoroughly in the
debate. To begin with the last thing first,
_eminent domain_ is an eminently discardable
principle, but it is not found anywhere
in Indian law, modern or ancient. It is
an English notion --- that the sovereign
has supervening right over everybody's
property --- borrowed by the Supreme Court
to defend the state's power to effect land
reforms. It is part of the failure of Indian
jurisprudence that even when the courts
wanted to defend good things they have
relied on the importation of safe principles
from the English law rather than risk
looking at the welfare dimensions of the
Indian Constitution itself. The notion that
the state is a _trustee_ of natural resources
on behalf of the people is another such
principle. It was invoked to defend environmental
concerns. Like the principle of
_eminent domain_ this one too is class
neutral and can turn against the poor,
whereas if the courts had relied on the
directives in _Part IV_ of the Constitution,
they would have found support for land
reforms and environmental legislation
which is not class neutral and cannot be
turned against the poor.

_The Land Acquisition Act, 1894_ was
less objectionable in its colonial form
when its power was confined to acquisition
for a public purpose, than its postcolonial
amendment of the year 1984
which permitted compulsory acquisition
of land for companies too. However, the
structure of that law shows that it was
intended only for acquisition of small
bits of land for purely local purposes
like a school or road in a village. It was
never intended for massive land acquisition
for projects and industries. A
completely new law is needed for such
land acquisition, which must have written
into it a clear and unambiguous
definition of what is _public purpose_ and
must encompass the framework of a
comprehensive scheme of _rehabilitation_
which will guarantee full protection of
livelihood, opportunities and community
life, devised in a manner that ensures
that the scheme as operationalised meets
with the satisfaction of the displaced.

For the power of _compulsory land acquisition_
as a purely statutory power
without any philosophy of _eminent domain_
cannot be taken away from the state. The
suggestion that land can be acquired only
if the landholder is willing or only with
the approval of the _gram sabha_ is a notion
innocent of social realities. Imagine a
situation where the government wants to
construct a housing colony for homeless
_dalits_ in a village, and there is no government
land in the village and all private
land is held by caste Hindus. If the
government is to await the consent of the
farmers or the _gram sabha_, it may well
wait forever. Consent of the _gram sabha_
as a precondition for land acquisition
makes sense only in tribal areas, that
too where class divisions have not yet
taken place on a significant scale, but
not in the class and caste divided
plains.

Finally, one word about the idea doing
the rounds (it seems to have emanated
with the Congress leadership) that the
government shall not acquire land for
_SEZs_ and other industrial ventures, but
shall leave it to the investors to do so.
This is legally absurd because no private
person has the right to compulsorily
acquire another's land. What is in fact
happening in the guise of this seemingly
fine principle can be seen in Andhra
Pradesh, especially the Kakinada _SEZ_.
The government agrees to pay compensation
according to the consent of the
landholder, and lets the investor negotiate
the price. He first negotiates with the
gentlemen farmers or absentee landlords
who are tired of the uncertainty of extracting
rent from unwilling tenants and
would like to get rid of the land. The
government then tells the other land-losers
that they too shall accept the same
rate, or else receive _notional market
value_ and litigate in the courts, and
they shall please inform the district
collector of their decision by the last
day of the next month, on which date
the offer closes. Trust the rulers of this
country to pervert the highest sounding
principles!
