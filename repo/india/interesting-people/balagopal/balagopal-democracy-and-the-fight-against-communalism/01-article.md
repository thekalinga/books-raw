This is a belated response to Sumanta
Banerjee's '_Sangh Parivar_ and Democratic
Rights' (EPW, August 21, 1993). Belated,
hut certainly not loo late, for the issue he
has raised is one that we are living with, and
will continue to live with for a long time
to come. And the attitudes he adopts are part
of the legacy of the left that needs to be
critically re-thought.

Banerjee's suggestion that the -left and
secular forces should be prepared to take on
the _Hindutva_ forces physically cannot be
faulted, if by that he means that they should
be prepared to face force with force in defence
of the existence and the rights of the Muslims
or other likely targets of the Hindu
communalists, such as for instance the _dalit_
communities. If this is all he means, his
complaint that the secular forces are hesitant
to take the plunge and are seeking tame refuge
in issuing pamphlets and holding seminars
is a valid complaint too. Though one is sure
he does not object to the issuing of pamphlets
and the holding of seminars as such.

But Banerjee's complaint and argument
do not stop there. Alleging fairly enough
that "the left parties ... have betrayed an
unwillingness to engage unhesitatingly in
confronting the politico-religious configuration
of _Hindutva_ and throw the power of
their organised working class base behind
such a confrontation", and citing the
example of the heroic of tragic efforts of
the German and Italian communists of the
1930s, he adds thai the left parties justify
their inertia by chanting the old principle
("now reduced to an almost anachronistic
mantra") that "communalism should be
fought ideologically and politically, instead
of by administrative measures". Let us ignore
for a moment whether the organised or other
working class is itself interested in being
'thrown' into the confrontation with
communalism (for it is always assumed that
the working class is ready for all such
progressive tasks, and only the leadership
is at fault). What is striking in his argument
is that he begins with the working class as
the possible but neglected battering ram
against communalism. and ends with
administrative measures' as the force
needlessly despised by the left. This is not
an isolated slip in his argument. Throughout
his argument against 'democratic tolerance
towards the Hindu communalists, Sumanta
Banerjee is quite ambiguous on the question:
whose tolerance is he talking about? That
of the democratic forces, or that of the
institutions of the Indian state and the
political process called the government of
India? It is precisely because Sumanta
Banerjee, given his long involvement in
civil rights work, cannot be accused of a
light-hearted altitude towards democracy and
democratic rights, that this ambiguity needs
to be discussed.

The _Sangh parivar_ does not believe in
democracy, nor in the democratic values
expressed in the Indian Constitution. The
more it grows, the more it will destroy those
values. And so to show the _Sangh parivar_
democratic tolerance is to wantonly destroy
democracy. The preservation of democracy
and the protection of the lives of the thousands
of individuals who are likely to be sacrificed
for the rise of the _parivar_ are much more
important than the democratic rights of the
_unholy parivar_. This is the crux of Banerjee's
argument.

# THE DILEMMA

There is no denying that there is a dilemma
here. But let us look at all that is involved
here --- all the elements of the dilemma
--- before we come to a conclusion. The denial
of democratic rights such as for instance the
rights of free speech and assembly to any
individual or group in society does not only
destroy the chances of that individual or
group to grow and dominate society. It
simultaneously destroys the values expressed
by the rights denied, and the institutions
responsible for guaranteeing those rights.
These values and institutions may be termed
'_bourgeois_' (I am not imputing this
terminology to Sumanta Banerjee) if their
historical origin and philosophical expression
is traced to the anti-feudal democratic
revolutions of Europe which resulted in the
domination of capital over society. For the
reason of that historical origin the specific
meaning and institutional form of the eights
do also carry _bourgeois_ limitations.
Nevertheless, each such right expresses a
value that is as much a lasting resource of
human civilisation as the steam engine that
Marx was immensely impressed by, and
each of the institutions evolved by _bourgeois_
society for the implementation of the rights
(a professional and independent judiciary,
for instance) embodies principles that need
to be carried forward while the structural and
conceptual limitations of the institutions
(such as the equation of total alienation from
society with judicial impartiality) are
criticised and overcome. Every contemporary
civil liberties struggle must strive and does
strive not only to protect a given right in
a given context (the right of a prisoner against
torture, or of slum-dwellers against eviction)
but also the democratic values and
institutional principles relating to that right,
while critically overcoming the _bourgeois_
expression of the notions and forms in which
the principles are embodied, and the
institutions in which their realisation is
enshrined. This is a complex task that can
never be reduced to a black and white 'class
character' of rights (such as that _bourgeois_
democracy is honeyed poison, with accent
on the poison, or that it is more of a poison
because it is honeyed, with accent on the
honey), though the class character does enter
the definition, conceptualisation and
institutionalisation of the rights.

This preface is not intended to imply that
Sumanta Banerjee has expressed himself in
these terms: it is however necessary to state
these ideas in black and white to realise the
full implication of Banerjee's argument. He
recognises the crudest of these implications
when he posits an argument his critics may
offer: if the police are allowed to behave
unlawfully with the _Sangh parivar_ they are
likely to behave in the same fashion with
others. He does not really answer this
argument, probably because he does not
regard it worth while to do so. Yet. one only
has to listen to complaints about police
misbehaviour in post-Gill Punjab to realise
how serious the consequences of wilful
erosion of legality in police behaviour can
be. (We had a taste of it when some companies
of commandos from Punjab were posted in
Karimnagar to thwart the Peoples War's bid
to forcefully obstruct the election process:
the commandos struck terror among women
by behaving like privileged studs in heat.)
In Andhra Pradesh, policemen who have
done a stint in the _naxalite_ affected areas are
taking to such lawless behaviour wherever
they are posted in the state that the public
opinion' that condoned police excesses in
Telangana because it fell the _naxalites_ did
not deserve democratic rights is now rueing
its altitude.

But this is only the crudest, and therefore
the most easily recognised, implication of
his argument. For instance, he also criticises
the judiciary for allowing 'democratic space'
to the _Sangh parivar_ by merely doing its duty
as understood by the judges concerned: for
striking down the ban order on a BJP rally
in Calcutta: for ordering the Orissa
administration to reopen the locked VHP
office: for striking down the ban on the RSS
and the Bajrang Dal; and for allowing the
installation of Ramlalla idols at the site of
the demolished masjid. Some of these orders
of the courts can be faulted for a lack of
judicial impartiality in interpreting facts and
the law. Such a criticism is even politically
very necessary for it points to the growth
of a shamelessly _pro-Hindutva_ outlook in
the judiciary and the administration, to the
detriment of the values of secularism and
the evenhanded interpretation of law. But
such is not Sumanta Banerjee's criticism. He
is against the granting of 'democratic space'
to the Sangh pari var by the courts irrespective
of how judicially correct the orders are. His
argument is that because the _Sangh parivar_
is a fascist force, it should not be allowed
any democratic space by the courts, quite
irrespective of the legal merits of the case.
How much harm this can do to the _Sangh
parivar_ one does not know, but it will certainly
do immense harm to the courts as an
institution of democracy --- of _bourgeois_
democracy, yes, but as we have said above,
that is not an uncomplicated description.

When we move from the judiciary to the
armed executive, the plea for greater
intolerance towards the fascists becomes
positively dangerous. Sumanta Banerjee is
allowed to lay down --- and legitimise in the
name of democratic rights --- the principle
that fascists do not deserve democracy. But
he will not be the one to determine who the
fascists are when the time of determination
comes. He is careful enough to argue that
his contention will not apply (if he can help
it) to the _naxalites_ and other radical forces,
who too indulge in unconstitutional acts,
because their goal is the constitutional goal
of socialism, and the democratic goal of
upliftment of the oppressed. This is both
irrelevant and arguable. It is irrelevant
because once 'the left, the liberal intellectuals
and the human rights groups' endorse the
view that the Indian state need not extend
democratic tolerance to fascists because such
tolerance will result in the growth of fascism
and the throttling of democracy, they are not
going to be consulted about whom the Indian
state will define as fascists, In his rhetoric,
Sumanta Banerjee has already included the
'Punjab and Kashmir terrorists' in the list
of the damned with whom the Hindu
communalists are to be treated on par and
denied democratic rights. Though his prose
leaves room for the unhappy supposition
that in his view democratic rights groups
should only oppose the torture and killing
of "non-involved persons' by the security
forces in situations such as Punjab and
Kashmir and not of persons who are actually
involved in the militancy, I will take it that
he intends it only as a rhetorical statement:
when the Punjab and Kashmir militants are
denied rights on the ground that their aims
are unconstitutional and their politics
communal, why should not the same apply
to the _Sangh parivar_? The Indian state will
be only too glad to use the licence Sumanta
Banerjee offers in reverse. Not only the
Punjab and Kashmir militants but also the
Naga, Mizo and other north-east militants
too have aims that are unconstitutional, and
some of them at least will probably not
ensure the rights of minorities in their regions
once they succeed (and in that sense are
communal). And yet it is precisely the civil
liberties groups that have consistently argued
that behind the secessionism and sectarianism
of these movements there is a historical
legacy and a social reality that need to be
tackled at the level of argument and
persuasion and not with guns; that the people
who support these movements should be
won over if that is at all possible, and not
terrorised; that even militants caught red-handed
should not be executed extra-judicially
but should be tried in a court of
law; and that at the end if it is not possible
to prevent secession by persuasion, then
they should be allowed to secede. This point-of
view, which was first expressed by a
handful of civil liberties groups in the teeth
of universal condemnation has now been
grudgingly accepted as a legitimate viewpoint
that has to be acknowledged and
accommodated, howsoever unwillingly. The
criterion whether the goals of a political
movement are constitutional or not, which
Sumanta Banerjee introduces quite arbitrarily
to distinguish the radical forces from the
_Sangh parivar_, can be a dangerous one. A
political group may honestly want to effect
changes which arc not visualised by the
Constitution, and may take to arms to that
end. It would be suicidal for the notion of
one's democratic right to espouse politics
of one's choice if on that ground civil rights
groups allow the state the discretion to deny
them the very right to exist politically, that
is, to enjoy the right of free speech, peaceful
assembly and a fair trial if arrested on charges
of violence.

Sumanta Banerjee, of course, has a more
solid criterion than constitutionality. This is
whether a movement is faithful to the ideals
of social, political and economic democracy.
He would argue that those who indulge in
violence towards ends which are violative
of those ideals do not deserve democratic
rights. But again, the question arises who
is to judge in case of doubt, for doubt there
will always be. Most of the minority-nationalities
movements in India can be
faulted with espousing ethnic self-determination
(an element of political
democracy) without commuting themselves
to a democratic form of political life after
liberation', and" also often at the cost of
social regression. The communists too can
he fairly accused of espousing economic and
social democracy at the cost of political
authoritarianism. And soon. Indeed, anyone
who wants to seriously dispute Sumanta
Banerjee' s argument that the _naxalites_ can
be allowed democratic rights for their goal
is the constitutional goal of socialism may
well argue (as the more intellectual among
police officers are already arguing) that all
that the communist revolutions have achieved
in this century is the discovery of a rather
crude and ungainly road to capitalism --- or
rather, neo-colonial subordination --- which
state India has any way reached by a more
civilised route, and therefore there is no
reason why the _naxalites_ should be allowed
the freedom to take a lot of lives and impose
upon this country an authoritarian
government. This argument can no doubt be
disputed by exhibiting the material and
cultural advancement of poor people's lives
under communist regimes, but it is the Indian
state and not some well-meaning democrat
that one will be trying to convince. And it
would be dangerous for the _naxalites_ and
other radical forces if their democratic right
to exist politically is predicated on the
possibility of proving to the satisfaction of
the Indian state that the trade-off between,
political authoritarianism and material well-being
in the erstwhile communist bloc
countries has been positive at the end of it all.

Democracy can only be indivisible because
in this imperfect world of imperfect human
beings and their imperfect politics there can
be no dividing line that will' ensure by mere
logic that all those who deserve democracy
will get it, and those who do not will not.
It is quite likely, on the contrary, that once
such a line is drawn and approved by the
left, the liberal intellectuals and human rights
groups', it is those who do not deserve it
that will get it, and it is those who deserve
democracy that will get pushed out, for it
is not those who have drawn the line that
will decide its application, but the likes of
PV Narasimha Rao.

But what will definitely happen in the
course of this effort is that the notion that
the state has the prerogative of deciding who
has the right to exist politically and who docs
not have that right gets legitimised, and that
is to the detriment of all that we understand
by democracy. If religious fundamentalism
can be a basis for fascism, so can state
authority if allowed to take arbitrary forms.
To call for strengthening the latter to fight
the former can be suicidal. In more immediate
terms, there is nothing that P V Narasimha
Rao would like more than to have the liberal
intellectuals and the civil liberties groups
egging him on to 'ruthlessly suppress by
coercive measures' the _Hindutva_ forces, for
when he decides to get tough with them, he
has all the democratic forces behind him.
and when he decides to be indulgent towards
them, he is more democratic than all the
democrats in the land. It would just suit his
kind of unprincipled and opportunist
manipulation that is read as ambivalence by
some, pragmatism by others, and the
quintessential broad-mindedness of an
ancient civilisation by the rest.

# WINNING OVER PEOPLE

But it is necessary to go deeper into the
matter. A discussion of some of the
assumptions that lie behind Sumanta
Banerjee's argument is necessary, quite apart
from the problem of Hindu communalism.
Sumanta Banerjee recognises that the
ideological battle against Hindu communalism
should enable us "to reconquer space
in the democratic arena in favour of the anti-communal
forces". One would imagine this
is the essence of the matter. This space that
is to be reconquered is not out there
somewhere in society, but in the minds of
the people, in the social consciousness of
the era. And therefore what he is saying is
the same as winning over people to the
secular and democratic world view. How is
this to be done? Why would or should people
be attracted to the secular and democratic
view of life? What is it that prevents people
from getting attracted to it? Sumanta Banerjee
says at one point that a democratic and
peaceful debate with _Hindutva_ is not possible
when people are all terrorised or partisan,
and rendered somnolent by the bulldozing
of _Hindutva_, Let us admit that more people
are partisan than are terrorised, and that what
is an opium-induced somnolence for you is
conviction born of faith for me. And it is
these convinced partisans that are to be won
over, or at least made to realise that their
ideas will not be allowed the legitimacy that
every idea requires to become socially
effective. Is that to be done by banning the
propagation of the ideas they are convinced
of ? Certainly, the least likely way of changing
people's views is to start by banning the
expression of the views to be changed.

In any case, the politics of _Hindutva_ is
based on a political and tendentious
elaboration of the day-to-day culture of
brahminical Hinduism, and while the Viswa
Hindu Parishad can be banned, neither this
culture nor its myriad organisations can be
banned. Can the Indian state place a ban on
the Ganesh Utsav Committees and the
Dassara Pooja Mandalis? Can it ban the
Shankaracharyas and the smaller fry among
the brahmin preachers from carrying on
_Hindutva_ propaganda? Can it ban the newly
created Dharmasansads that are issuing
ultimatums to the two brahmins sitting at the
top of the Indian state? Can it ban the
responsive chord that their dicta strike in the
hearts of the two brahmins ?

Assuming thai it can or will do this (which
is to assume the impossible), will it win
democratic space for the anti-communal
forces? All the erstwhile socialist countries
reasoned exactly thus, not only about ideas
of religious fanaticism, but all ideas
unpalatable to socialism. They only
succeeded in creating for themselves the
illusion that all reactionary ideas had died
out and the 'new man' was born. It only
required the removing of the lid to disclose
that not a single reactionary idea had died
out. And for having been suppressed
ruthlessly, religious and ethnic chauvinism
have burst out with a maniacal passion
unknown in countries which believed that
however unpalatable and pusillanimous it
may seem, political and ideological freedom,
is indivisible.

We do not yet know fully what it is in
human beings that keeps ethnic, religious or
communal violence alive as political
passions, and have been content with
explanations of why such violence is
espoused by whom in a given setting (which
is about all that Marxism as popularly
understood can tell us); but certainly, the
ruthless suppression that Sumanta Banerjee
advocates is no way to save ourselves from
the cancer. We can on the other hand try to
convince the oppressed and exploited classes,
castes and other social groups that _Hindutva_
is contrary to their material and cultural
interests we can work for organising such
people to resist the forces of _Hindutva_
physically if necessary; and we can try to
appeal to the democratic, humanist and anti-authoritarian
values that all human societies
possess side by side with values of
domination and suppression. The first of the
three tasks has been attempted on a sizeable
(if still inadequate) scale by the left parties,
the _dalit_ groups and other democratic
organisations. The second is yet to be
attempted on a significant scale, as Sumanta
Banerjee rightly complains. But the third is
a vital task whose necessity is insufficiently
understood by progressive forces because it
is not adequately comprehended by radical
political philosophies, including Marxism
which is the most comprehensive of them
all. So long as the fanatical chauvinism of
_Hindutva_ is not consciously rejected as a
value, or rather as a value-complex that
forms part of society's culture and shapes
human ideas and behaviour, it will not be
fully defeated, and even if it is defeated in
one form, it can re-emerge in ever new
forms, whether or not related to Hinduism.
(History is witness to innumerable instances
where those who have fought an
authoritarianism that oppressed them have
themselves turned authoritarian thereafter,
lor what they have fought is not oppression
_as such_ but the oppression of the Other that
has hurt their interests.)

And it is in view of this need of rejecting
Hindu fanaticism as a value-system that the
call for an end to democratic tolerance needs
to be rejected, for such a prescription allows
religious or ethnic fanaticism no content of
its own hut only the role of an instrumentality
in protecting a material interest. _Hindutva_.
on the contrary, is not only that but over and
above that it is a set of values, attitudes and
norms of behaviour that can only be countered
with the and of alternative values and norms.
And this task must necessarily be undertaken
by an open and equal debate that calls upon
the historically evolved human sense of
justice, equity and fairness. Such a debate
can never be conducted, and can never win
minds and open up democratic space, if one
party to the debate is suppressed by being
denied freedom of expression. Of all
arguments, an argument tor justice unfairly
conducted can never win approval, even if
it is entirely logical and scientific. That
would be contrary to the human moral sense.

The alternative values and norms can
emerge from struggles against Hindu
fanaticism; or rather, they can be recalled
through the struggles from the moral
storehouse of the human species, itself a
historically evolved and contradiction-ridden
product of human civilisation. This process
of emergence of new values from struggles
is not as straightforward a process as it seems
in the midst of struggles, but is an intricate
pattern of generalisation, consolidation and
recovery. A proper understanding of this
process requires a more thorough understanding
of the moral life of the human species
than is revealed by the base-superstructure
determinism and the concomitant presumption
that social consciousness can be fully
classified in a one to one fashion in terms
of the base determinants such as class or caste.

This moral life of the human species is
something that it has cultivated as elaborately
as its technical skills, and conjointly with
it. Any oppressive social structure or practice
such as for instance the fanaticism of the
majority reflected in Hindu chauvinism gains
support by appealing to what is violent,
destructive and anti-human in human moral
life. Democratic tolerance and the acceptance
of social equality as a principle, which are
central values of secularism in the Indian
context, appeal to the sense of justice that
human cultures equally possess. These moral
possibilities are intrinsic to human beings
as much as they are a product of history, in
the sense that they are a historically
determined elaboration of innate human
potential expressed in spontaneous qualities
such as empathy, satiety, revulsion, fear, etc.,
that are universal to human beings.

In understanding the moral life of the
human species, Marx's dictum that Being
determines Consciousness must be
understood with reference to the specific
nature and structure of _human_ consciousness
and _human_ psychology. Social being
determines social consciousness by virtue of
and through the specific form in which human
consciousness is structured. It is easily
demonstrable that humane ideals such as
equality and justice are born of resistance
to conditions of injustice and inequality,
whereas inhuman values are born of
oppressive social relations, and social
practices structured oppressively. But that
is not the whole of the matter. Firstly, the
values and the norms are the ideal form of
expression of immediate needs, interests and
aspirations, whether narrow or broad; it is
a characteristic of the structure of human
consciousness that immediate interests and
aspirations --- whether just or unjust, whether
of the oppressors or the oppressed --- get
expressed in terms of universal values, ideals
and moral precepts. This generalised
expression is not necessarily a fraud
perpetrated consciously for hegemonic social
purposes; nor is the generalised ideal coequal
with the immediate interest or
aspiration, an assumption that enters all
glorification of the 'class consciousness' of
the oppressed. It is on the contrary just what
it is: a characteristic feature of the structure
of human consciousness, of the nature of human
thought, which cannot conceive of immediate
interests except in terms of universal values,
just as in general it cannot think of the
concrete without the aid of abstractions.

And secondly, this universal value in which
a particular interest is expressed, or through
which a particular life condition is
conceptualised, is capable of surviving the
particular situation (indeed that is when we
realise that it is not co-equal with, nor a
fraudulent generalisation of, the particular
interest), of abstracting itself from the
particular context, and becoming part of the
'common sense of that society, attaching
itself to this and that situation, and acquiring
this and that inclining at later stages. There
is thus a continuous process of generation,
definition and specification of ethical norms,
values and precepts that arise in and are
generalised from specific lite situations and
snuggles, which process creates the moral
content of social culture which is
institutionalised in civil society in the manner
described by Gramsci and others, and which
in turn shapes human behaviour in society
through the kind of conflict typified (though
certainly not fully explained) by the Freudian
conflict between the ld and the Superego.
The ensemble of the values and ethical
principles that have accumulated in the
history of any society is a very complex
structure of norms that carry historically
specific meanings and interpretations
attached to moral absolutes such as truth,
kindness, love etc. A critical attitude to wards
this moral universe, in which one rejects the
inhumanity that hides behind high morality
and continuously calls forth the humanism
that co-exists with it. ought to be an important
part of radical political practice.

# NEED FOR A FRESH LOOK

All this has a bearing on the need to lake
a fresh look at familiar Marxist positions,
of which Sumanta Banerjee's is but one
example. The light against _Hindutva_ or
against authoritarianism and fascism in
general, is not just a defensive struggle to
protect democratic rights and values. It is
pari of the struggle for restructuring human
existence on a higher plane. The whole
question of this restructuring needs to be
rethought afresh, now that the total failure
of the communist project --- the attempt to
put Marx's ideas into practice --- is evident.
The proletariat has nowhere exhibited the
desire imputed to n by Marx to take charge
of the affairs of humanity and rebuild its
existence on the basis communist
collectivism. And the communist parties that
substituted themselves for the proletariat
have made a mess of the job. at enormous
cost, whichever way they tried, the Stalinist
way the Maoist way, the Titoist way, and
even the Sandinista way.

The basics of Marx's prognosis of the
future therefore need to be rethought, and
hence also the basics of his theory of history.
Marxism, as well as other radical and
progressive political philosophies, have
rightly stressed the necessity of organised
struggle against unjust social structures as
the only way of defeating them, for mere
moral preaching will never put an end to
injustice. But the rebuilding of human
existence in the form of just structures and
on the basis of just social relations is a
different matter. This rebuilding has wrongly
been seen as a direct continuation of the
struggle against injustice. This notion that
the force that is necessary to destroy unjust
social structures will by itself lead to the
reconstruction of society on a just basis
through the class rule of the oppressed has
been sufficiently proved an illusion by the
happenings of this century. Struggle against
oppressive social structures, and the
reconstruction of society on the basis of cooperative
and egalitarian relations, are
evidently linked not through the _dictatorship
of the fast victors, but through the cultural
possibilities opened up by the successive
struggles_. and there is no last snuggle, nor
a millennial victory. To understand this we
need a more complete understanding of
human consciousness, culture, forms of social
behaviour, and the mode of formation of the
human personality through the snuggle
between the universal psychic substratum of
human nature and the particular norms of
contradiction-ridden social culture, than even
a Gramsci ever attempted. (Mao's notion of
cultural revolution is politically inspiring,
but philosophically it goes no farther than
is allowed by the base-superstructure
framework.)

The elaboration of its technical capabilities
by the human species in its struggle to win
a livelihood from nature has been given a
central place by Marx in the notion of human
progress. This elaboration is based on the
specific physical structure of human beings,
such as the possession of two hands to work
with, and a brain capable of an elaborate
learning process. But equally, human
progress has involved the elaboration of
moral values conducive to a co-operative,
collective appropriation of the wealth created
by the hands and the brain, which values
have been elaborated in a struggle against
anti-social values (also generated in the
course of the same history) of oppression,
domination and violence. This moral
evolution is a historical process of elaboration
of moral possibilities implied by the specific
psychic structure of human beings, a structure
that makes both anti-social and social
responses intrinsically possible. What human
beings have done for themselves with their
physical possibilities is made the thread of
human history and therefore also the thread
of human liberation (for in Marx's
understanding, liberation is immanent to
history) by Marx. This has given us valuable
insights into our past and valuable guidelines
for our future. But this understanding is
incomplete without supplementing it with
an understanding of what human beings
have done for themselves with their moral
potential, and what future that indicates for
the species.

Marx certainly did not ignore the moral
history of humankind, but for him this moral
history has no parameters of its own but is
a derivative of the material history. This is
evidently not true. The human species
possesses moral as well as physical
possibilities --- based on its psychic and
physical structures --- both of which it has
elaborated conjointly in the course of Its
struggle to satisfy its (constantly elaborated)
needs. The one is not a derivative of the
other. The two are two limbs of the process
of conjoint realisation of the total potential
of the species on the basis of a given
framework of its physical and psychological
needs and responses. The physical structure
is the starting point for its technological
evolution, and the psychic structure the
starting point of its moral evolution, both
of which are part of a single process. That
the potential of human material development
is not unlimited and unbounded as is
sometimes implied in Marx has been well
brought out by the ecology movement.
Human moral potential is also equally not
an unlimited and unbounded one, as imagined
in the wilder of Marx's ideas about
communism. What we require today is a
reinterpretation of all thai is true in Marx's
theory of history and society from the point
of view of the totality of the human subject,
the totality of its given humanness, physical
as well as psychic, rather than the human
subject reduced to an intelligent and
acquisitive toiling animal, whoso moral
possibilities are rendered infinite and
irrelevant for political practice by being
simply ignored theoretically.

The future revealed by such a
reinterpretation may not look particularly
rosy right now, and one cannot be denied
one's rightful pessimism about any
millennium: for while human beings are
universally capable of both violence and
love, cruelty and generosity, it is violence
and cruelty that have constituted the
fundamental organising principles of all
social structures (e g. property, caste, family)
in all civilised human societies till now.
whereas the" human capacity for empathy,
love and kindness has been subordinated to
these violent structures (often in a cruelly
distorted form). The only reason for not
totally rejecting Marx's utopia is that while
all people at all times have indulged in
hatred, violence and falsehood, not merely
as personal aberrations but as fundamental
structural practices, there is no human society
that has accepted these modes of behaviour
as morally noble. On the contrary, only love,
kindness and truth have been accorded that
honour in all societies. The anti-social
qualities, have certainly been sanctioned
morally and socially and even mandated as
in brahminical dharma, but always in the
name of higher values such as truth and
equity. (Amartya Sen in his study of
inequalities says that even those who defend
inequality do so in the name of a higher
equality.) Perhaps this paradox of human
civilisation understood as a quality of its
moral universe gives hope of the possibility
of a 'co-operative commonwealth of the
working people' (in which everyone does
all work), provided that the struggle for
appropriating the material wealth it has
produced for and by the whole of the society
rather than a fraction of it, is joined with
a struggle to invert the moral universe of the
species so that violence is subordinated in
social structure and habitual practice to love,
and envy similarly to generosity.

But perhaps also not. In any case, if the
millennium fails our practice must at least
give us a reformed society, which is doubtful
if we go on uncritically repeating old ideas
and altitudes.
