_In a recent judgment, which is replete with arguments against
reservations as such, the Supreme Court has argued that
apportionment of the reservations made to SCs or STs to subgroups
within cannot be done by the state legislatures. Indeed, even
Parliament does not have the competence to do so since the
Constitution has intended that the SCs and STs are an indivisible,
homogeneous entity._

\ 

Living apart as they do from social
realities, judges sometimes come
up with wrong judgments at disastrously
wrong moments.

A notable feature of Indian society in
recent years is that from out of disadvantaged
people who are dealt with by the law
as well as in the idiom of social justice
as homogeneous classes (_dalits_, minorities,
women, etc), categories asserting their
further discrimination have emerged, seeking
society's attention to their particular
plight. The situation calls for a sensitive
response that will neither deny them
further discrimination nor use it as a stick
to beat the parent category with.

The _Madiga_ campaign for subdivision
of the _scheduled caste_ reservation in
Andhra Pradesh is a very prominent such
instance. Asserting that within the _scheduled
castes_ there is a local hierarchy of
social status, worth, value (and even
touchability), and also that the _scheduled
caste_ reservation is being taken disproportionately
by two of them, namely, the _Adi
Andhras_ and _Malas_, the _Madigas_ ran a
successful campaign to persuade the
state government to make a four-fold subdivision
of the _scheduled castes_ in the
state, and apportion the reservation to the
four subgroups in such a manner that all
may in fact get a more equitable share.
Almost nobody other than a section of the
relatively better placed _scheduled castes_
has denied the fact of further discrimination
within the _dalit_ communities, and all political
parties have supported the campaign.

But it has foundered on the law as
understood by the courts. The conclusive
(for the present) view of a Constitution
bench of five judges of the Supreme Court
is that it is constitutionally impermissible
to do what the _Madigas_ wanted. Why and
how the court said so we shall see below.
But as a general caveat it must be said that
whatever may be the defects of our Constitution,
and there are many, any one who
knows that document would view with
scepticism any assertion of a disjoint
between its prescriptions and any aspiration
for social or political justice and the
social or political impediments in giving
effect to constitutional possibilities. The
only exception to this would be the aspiration
for _self-determination_ of unwilling
components of what would be the Indian
Nation, which is irrefutably unconstitutional,
as the Constitution now stands.

# Andhra Pradesh Order

Persuaded by the vigorous campaign
launched by the _Madigas_, the government
of Andhra Pradesh initially issued an order
which was struck down by a full bench
of the high court, principally on the ground
that the government had not consulted the
_National Commission for Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes_, but also on
more doubtful grounds. Later, after completing
that consultation, the government
passed an Act (_Act 20 of 2000)_ to the same
effect. As before, this was challenged by
persons of the _Mala_ and _Adi Andhra_
communities, but a five-judge bench of
the high court, by a majority of four to
one, upheld the Act, overruling the other
objections the previous bench had expressed.
Against that the petitioners appealed
to the Supreme Court, for which
leave was granted by the high court, and
in the apex court they have succeeded. A
five-judge bench of the Supreme Court,
in _E V Chinnaiah vs State of AP_, has
unanimously held the Act to be unconstitutional,
in a judgment that is poor in logic
and poorer in judicial wisdom.

The Supreme Court says two things:
(1) Apportionment of the reservations
made to SCs or STs to subgroups within
cannot be done by the state legislatures.
Only Parliament has the competence to do
so. (2) But even Parliament does not have
the competence to do so since the Constitution
has intended that the SCs and STs
are an indivisible --- homogeneous entity.
Maybe in fact they are not, but for all
constitutional purposes they are.

Both the contentions are demonstrably
ill-founded. But until at least a bench of
seven judges of the Supreme Court says
so, or the Constitution is amended to clarify
that it has been saddled with what the
makers of the document never intended,
all aspirations for _inter se_ justice within
the _dalit_ and _adivasi_ groups --- aspirations
which are only now finding voice --- will
have to stay mute, constitutionally speaking.
In fact, the Supreme Court has gone
to the extent of saying that it is not permissible
to even appoint a commission of
enquiry to identify the more backward
among the _scheduled castes_.

Three separate but concurring judgments
have been written by the five-judge bench,
none of them more edifying than the others:
N Santosh Hegde for himself, S N Variava
and B P Singh; H K Sema for himself;
and S B Sinha for himself. It is something of
a strain to unravel the thread of the reasoning
adopted by them, not because it is profound,
but because lack of logical clarity and
connectedness has become a very common
characteristic of judicial pronouncements
even at the highest level these days
and this judgment is a classic instance.

The constitutional position concerning
the _scheduled caste_ and _scheduled tribe_
lists (there is a separate list for each state)
is clear. _Article 341_ says: (1) The president
may with respect to any State or Union
Territory, and where it is a State, in consultation
with the governor thereof, by
public notification, specify the castes, races,
or tribes, or parts of or groups within
castes, races or tribes which shall for the
purposes of this Constitution be deemed
to be _scheduled castes_ in relation to that
State or Union Territory, as the case may
be. (2) Parliament may by law include or
exclude from the list of _scheduled castes_
specified in a notification issued under
clause (1) any caste, race or tribe or part
of or group within any caste, race or tribe,
but save as aforesaid a notification issued
under the said clause shall not be varied
by any subsequent notification.

_Article 342_ is a similar provision for
_scheduled tribes_.

Thus, the president initially declares the
list of _scheduled castes_ in consultation
with the governors of the respective states,
and any inclusion or exclusion thereafter
is done by an Act of Parliament. Except
by an Act of Parliament the SC or ST list
cannot be modified to include or exclude
a caste. Every other authority including the
state and central governments is bound by
these lists so declared and amended.

# Discretion of Authorities

But subject to acceptance of these lists
as they stand, the giving of reservations
or the making of any other special provisions
is a wide discretion available to the
authorities at all levels. This discretion
contrasts sharply with the very clear reservation
of the power to declare a community
to be SC or ST, to the president
initially and Parliament thereafter. The
courts have repeatedly held that it requires
no Act of any legislature to give reservations
or special provisions. Every instrumentality
of the state and every local body
is free to do so in the course of the exercise
of its administrative authority, within the
usual limits of fairness and reasonableness
that apply to all governmental action.

Why should not this discretion include
also the power to divide the special provisions
it makes among the beneficiaries
in such a way that it is more equitably
accessed by them? No caste is added to
or deleted from the SC/ST list thereby. The
lists remain intact. If not every authority,
the state executive and legislature certainly
have this power since they have the power
to administer and legislate in connection
with education, employment and social
welfare.

The Supreme Court says _no_, because the
constitutional provision that only Parliament
can add to or delete from the SC/ST
lists means much more than what it says.
It means (in the words of Santosh Hegde)
that any action that "interferes, disturbs,
rearranges, regroups or reclassifies the
various castes in the list" unless it is an
Act of Parliament is barred by the Constitution.
How does the Court read so much
into the plain language of _Article 341_? The
Supreme Court is no Humpty-Dumpty to
make words mean what it wants them to
mean. It must obey and follow the meaning
of the expressions themselves. Where the
expressions are plain it has no discretion
to add or subtract anything. It is only where
the expressions are obscure or otherwise
of doubtful meanings that the court steps
in, not to give them the meaning it wishes
but to elicit what the lawmakers may have
meant. There is nothing whatsoever obscure
or doubtful about _Article 341_.

It is true that legal theory holds that
interpretation of the Constitution is different
from interpretation of ordinary law,
and that the Constitution must be interpreted
liberally, broadly, and in a manner
suitable for the _changing times_ and social
needs. This is not the place to go into a
discussion of that seemingly attractive
proposition, though one is entitled to be
suspicious of the sudden eruption of respect
for _changing times_ in usually conservative
circles ever since the rise of neo-liberalism.
But whatever that proposition
means it cannot mean that the Supreme
Court will rewrite the Constitution. Briefly
it may be said that words used in the
Constitution which are in the nature of
_concepts or generalities_ can be and must
be given meaning keeping changed circumstances,
hopes and aspirations in view.

The wide meaning sought to be given
by the courts to the abstract noun '_life_' in
_Article 21_ is an instance. But, plain words
which lay down who can do what and how,
cannot be given any other than literal
interpretation, since we do not want that
judges rewrite the Constitution to suit their
views and values. One major criticism of
the only _Constituent Assembly_ we ever
had is that it was not elected on universal
adult suffrage. We do not want to have an
unelected second one now. In any case, if
_changing times_ is the touchstone for reading
constitutional provisions differently
than what they seem to plainly say, then
the most relevant change in this context
is the rising aspirations of the _disadvantaged
within the disadvantaged_, and not
the opposition of the more advantageously
placed among them to the nascent grievance
of those below.

# Ambedkar's Observations

In support of the wide meaning that
Santosh Hegde has chosen to give Article
341, he quotes an observation of
Ambedkar's in the _Constituent Assembly_
debates. When a question was raised as to
why the president, who declares the list
of SCs and STs, should not be given the
power to add or delete communities from
the list, and why that power should be
given to Parliament, Ambedkar is supposed
to have said that it was to "eliminate
any kind of political factors having a play
in the matter of the disturbance in the
_Schedule_ so published by the President".
That Ambedkar used the expression 'disturbance'
in this context is relied upon to
draw the far-fetched inference that any
_disturbance_, and not merely addition or
deletion of a community, is included in the
meaning of "include or exclude" in _Article
341(2)_. Ambedkar was talking of some
thing else. He evidently apprehended that
the president may act as an instrument of
the party in power in adding or deleting
communities from the SC/ST list, whereas
even if the party in power has a majority
in the Parliament, the very process of lawmaking
with its debate and discussion
would act as a check on _mala fide_ politics.
It is this problem that he was addressing
and not the issue whether adding or deleting
communities from the lists includes
any and every '_disturbance_'. A word used
by a speaker can be given meaning in
relation to an issue only if that issue was
present in the mind of the speaker when
the word was used. The Supreme Court
has in recent times laid down the proposition
that it is permissible to look into the
_Constituent Assembly_ debates to understand
the meaning of provisions of the
Constitution. That certainly does not mean
that the sense of a word in relation to one
context can be deducted from the use of
the word in a different context in the
debates.

The other and more portentous view of
the Supreme Court is that _scheduled caste_
is a single class, a homogeneous expression,
and therefore no further subgrouping
within the _scheduled castes_ is permissible.
The way the reasoning in support of this
view is elaborated, the view would apply
also to the _scheduled tribes_. And it would
also negate the power conceded to Parliament
in the first limb of the court's decision
to make a classification of the
_scheduled castes_. It would make the regrouping
unconstitutional, whether done
by the state legislature or by Parliament.

S B Sinha's concurring and lengthy
judgment is entirely devoted to making
this point, but one may read it backward
and forward a dozen times and still not find
any reason in it. He cites provisions of the
Constitution where the _scheduled tribes_ of
what we would today call the north-east
are treated separately from the _scheduled
tribes_ of the rest of the country, and adds
that this shows that where the Constitution
wanted to make a sub-classification of the
SCs or STs it has itself done so, and
therefore where it has chosen not to do so,
such classification is impermissible. All
that it in fact proves is that inequality
within the SCs or STs in general was not
a given for the Constitution-makers the
way the peculiar history of the tribal areas
of what was in those days known as Assam.
Nothing more can reasonably be concluded
from this, unless one intends to stultify the
Constitution, which is exactly what is
sought to be provided against when legal
theory says that the interpretation of constitutional
law proceeds on a somewhat
different footing than the interpretation
of ordinary law.

It is important that neither S B Sinha nor
any of the other judges has expressed doubt
about the state government's stand that
there is inequality within the _scheduled
castes_ and that the reservations provided
for the _scheduled castes_ are being preponderantly
taken by a few of the 59 _scheduled
castes_. It is better to hear this in S B Sinha's
own language:

>It may not be necessary for us to delve deep
into the question as to whether the factual
foundation for enacting the said legislation
being based on a report of a _Court of
Enquiry_ constituted under _Section 3_ of the
_Commissions of Enquiry Act, 1952_ known
as _Justice Raju Report_ is otherwise laudable
or not.

# _Question of Law_

The question then is reduced to a pure
_question of law_: whether it is permissible
to identify subgroups of the SCs which
have benefited little from reservations and
allot their quota separately to them, leaving
the residue as the quota of those who
have benefited disproportionately. _No_, says
the Supreme Court. Before seeing the
reasons, here is a statement of the job
undertaken by the Supreme Court, in the
words of the same judge:

>The approach to construe the impugned
legislation should not be based on the
subjective intention of legislation but
should be given an objective meaning. The
meaning is declared by the courts after
application of the relevant principles so as
to construe the constitutionality of a statute
having regard to the object the Constitutionmakers
sought to achieve.

"Subjective intention of legislation"? It
can only mean, if it means any thing at all,
the _object of the legislation_. Or is it the
subjective intention of the legislature that
the judge is referring to? But how can
_intention_ be anything other than subjective?
One hears of subjective assessment
of a fact, subjective taking of a decision,
subjective exercise of discretionary
powers. In these matters the antinomy of
subjective and objective makes sense. But
there can be no objective intention. And
what could be the "_objective meaning_" of
legislation? What the judge wants to say
perhaps is that whatever the legislature
may have intended in enacting the law, his
job is to look at its power to do so under
the Constitution, in the light of the object
the Constitution-makers sought to achieve
by defining _scheduled castes_ and making
special provisions for them.

# Alleged Impermissibility

Here are some of the reasons offered by
S B Sinha for holding that such power does
not exist:

>Our Constitution permits application of
equality clause by grant of additional
protection to the disadvantaged class so as
to bring them on equal platform with other
advantaged class of people. Such a class
which requires the benefit of additional
protection, thus, cannot be discriminated
_inter se_, i.e., between one member of the
said class and another only on a certain
presupposition of some advancement by
one group over other although both satisfy
the test of abysmal backwardness as
also inadequate representation in public
service.

"Presupposition" is unfair. It is based on
what the same judge has earlier described
as the _Justice Raju report_. Having declared
that it is not necessary to spend time on
the factual foundation of that report, he
cannot now use the expression "presupposition"
for the opinion based on that
report. Moving then to the logic of the
alleged impermissibility, firstly the _inter
se_ classification is not between individuals
but between clearly demarcated sub-groups.
These are separate castes, have
separate names, sometimes separate traditional
occupations and separate cultural
practices. They do not intermarry, and the
higher among them do not normally inter-dine
with the lower. Thus they are clearly
demarcated groups. As for provision of
reservation in employment, it is after all
the whole purpose of _Article 16(4)_ to
provide reservations for backward classes
who are inadequately represented in the
_civil services_:

>Nothing in this Article shall prevent the
State from making any provision for the
reservation of appointments or posts in
favour of any backward class of citizens
which, in the opinion of the State, is not
adequately represented in the services under
the State.

Having identified 59 castes as _scheduled
castes_ and having found that they are
inadequately represented in the _civil services_,
reservation has been given to them
in government jobs. But after a while it
is found that some of the 59 castes continue
to be under-represented in the services
under the state because the reservation
given in the name of all of them has been
taken to a disproportionate extent by some
of them. Cannot _Article 16(4)_ be pressed
into service? If it is said that it cannot, then
the power given under _Article 16(4)_ is
declared to be curtailed by the supposed
bar read by the court into _Article 341_. Is
it permissible to read a plainly worded
power in the Constitution that too one in
the _fundamental rights_ chapter, in such a
manner that it is limited by a judicial
interpretation --- and a somewhat strained
one at that --- of another provision of the
Constitution?

>As the Constitution itself treats the members
of the _scheduled castes_ as a single
integrated class of most backward citizens,
it is not competent for the legislature of
a State to subdivide them into separate
compartments with a separate percentage
of reservation for each resulting in discouraging
merit as well as the endeavour
of individual members to excel --- _vide_
fundamental duty under _Article 51-A(j)_.

The latter part of this is a position that
tends against reservation itself. Indeed,
as I will argue at the end, this judgment
is in truth a view against reservations as
such, though apparently only about the
impermissibility of subdividing _scheduled
caste_ reservations. That the victorious
sections of the _dalits_ are unable to see this
point is a tragedy by itself. It has always
been the argument of the upper castes in
opposing reservations that it discourages
"merit" and the endeavour to "excel". The
courts have for decades resisted this argument
with cogent reasons. Is it permissible
to use this argument now in to oppose
subdivision of reservations?

As for the Constitution treating the
members of the _scheduled castes_ as "a
single integrated class of most backward
citizens" --- that is what needs to be demonstrated ---
not proclaimed. Where does the
Constitution say so? In the judgment
written by Santosh Hegde too, one finds
this syllogistic conundrum: _Scheduled
castes_ are the backward-most in society.
If you say that some of them are more
backward than the others, then that
means that the less backward among
them can no longer be among the most
backward in society, because there are
some who are more backward than them.
Ergo, the _scheduled castes_ cannot be
divided into the more and the less backward,
since by definition they are all the
"backward-most".

# Syllogistic Conundrum

No where does the Constitution say that
the _scheduled castes_ are the _backward-most_
in society, which is the proposition
with which this syllogism starts. The
Constitution does not define _scheduled
castes_ in social terms at all. _Scheduled
castes_ are those who find themselves in
the _scheduled caste list_, as declared by the
president and amended from time to time
by Parliament. If a social indicator of what
would constitute _scheduled caste_ is needed,
one can look into the debates in the
_Constituent Assembly_, as the courts have
frequently been doing to ascertain the
meaning assigned to terms used in the
Constitution. Or one can look at administrative
practice in identifying the _scheduled
castes_. It will be found that _scheduled
castes_ are none but the '_panchamas_'[^panchamas],
untouchables, of Hindu society. Everybody
knows this but in the reams and reams
of judicial exposition on the matter, the
courts have for some reason found it
impossible to say so, though V R Krishna
Iyer in his significant judgment in _State
of Kerala vs N M Thomas, 1976_ consistently
refers to _scheduled castes_ as
'_harijans_' (the word _dalit_ had not come
into vogue then).

[^panchamas]: Pancha means five. A member of the fifth and lowest division of society (now called the scheduled castes), outside the four brahminic divisions; a pariah; an untouchable.

That the _scheduled castes_ are the backward-most
is an evaluation of their social
status, but in fact what defines them is
untouchability. Indeed, in many states there
are some communities listed in the OBC
list who may well be socially more backward
than the _scheduled castes_, such as for
instance the '_Dommaras_' of Andhra
Pradesh, but are not in the SC list because
they are not untouchable.

# 1976 Judgment

The description of _scheduled castes_ as
_backward-most_ (the _most backward_, the
_abysmally backward_, etc) is owed to the
Supreme Court itself, and in a very different
context. _State of Kerala vs N M
Thomas, 1976_ is also a Constitution bench
judgment scriped by seven judges, each of
whom wrote his own judgment. A conscious
attempt was made by them, especially
V R Krishna Iyer, to clear much of
the confusion that had gathered around
reservations, thanks to the inhibitions that
clogged the conservative minds that have
always ruled the courts. In the course of
the attempt, V R Krishna Iyer used many
expressions --- inclined as he was to literary
largesse --- indicating the position and
situation of the _scheduled castes_: 'lowliest
and the lost', 'utterly depressed', 'stark
backwardness', 'bottom layer', 'most
backward classes', 'sunken sections', are
among those expressions. He carried on
the exposition in _Akhil Bharatiya Soshit
Karamchari Sangh (Rly) vs Union of India, 1981_,
where he said even more plainly that
the _scheduled castes_ are 'not merely backward
but the backward-most'. This rhetorical
device used as an expository technique
to emphasise the justification for
special provisions, seems later to have
become definitive of _scheduled castes_, and
has now been used to beat the more disadvantaged
of them with. But the same
judge, in _State of Kerala vs N M Thomas_,
regularly used the word '_harijan_' to describe
the _scheduled castes_, which could
equally have been taken as definitive of
that category, which would have been closer
to the intention of the makers of the
Constitution and administrative practice.
And then the syllogism that prohibits subgrouping
and apportionment of the SC
quota would no longer operate. It is found
that some untouchables are untouchable
for other untouchables, then why should
they not be classified separately within the
list of untouchables, what would be unreasonable
about it?

The alternative contention that the _scheduled
castes_ constitute a 'homogeneous
class', a 'single integrated class', a 'single
class by themselves', and therefore cannot
be grouped is even less tenable. Here are
some of the elements of juridical wisdom
found in the judgment:

>It is a well-settled principle in law that
reservation to a backward class is not a
constitutional mandate. It is the prerogative
of the state concerned if it so desires,
with an object of providing opportunity of
advancement in the society to certain
backward classes which includes the _scheduled
castes_, to reserve certain seats in
educational institutions under _Article 15(4)_
and in public services under the State under
_Article 16(4)_. That part of its constitutional
obligation, as stated above, has already
been fulfilled by the State. Having done
so, it is not open to the State to sub-classify
a class already recognised by the Constitution
and allot a portion of the already
reserved quota among the State-created
sub-classes within the list of _scheduled
castes_ (Santosh Hegde).

The giving of reservation is said to be
not a constitutional mandate but a discretionary
prerogative of the State. But once
it is exercised in relation to a class
recognised by the Constitution, the prerogative
is lost, the discretion is gone,
insofar as it concerns subdividing the
allotted reservation among groups within
the class. But why? The Constitution
recognises the class, _viz_, the _scheduled
castes_, in the sense that it is conscious that
there are certain very specially placed
peoples in our society who need to be
endowed with special rights, shown special
concern by the administration, etc. The
list of those peoples is left to be declared
by the president and amended from time
to time by Parliament. The measures to be
taken for their advancement or protection
is the prerogative of the State. It is the
discretion of the State to adopt such special
measures as it would like, to realise the
intention of the Constitution-makers in the
matter. Where does the Constitution warrant
putting a full stop to this prerogative
after the State has made provision for the
class as a whole, so long as the State does
not add or delete castes from the list?
Where is the State barred from looking at
who is taking what is given for the class
as a whole, and doing something reasonable
to set that right?

>The whole basis of reservation is to provide
additional protection to the members
of the _scheduled castes_ and _scheduled
tribes_ as a class of persons who have been
suffering since a considerable length of
time due to social and educational backwardness.
The protection and reservation
is afforded to a homogeneous group ... By
the impugned legislation, the State has
sought to regroup the homogeneous group
specified in the presidential notification
for the purpose of reservation and appointments.
It would amount to discrimination
in reverse and would attract the wrath of
_Article 14_ of the Constitution. It is a trite
law that justice must be equitable. Justice
to one group at the cost of injustice to other
group is another way of perpetuating
injustice (H K Sema).

# Argument against Equity

It is trite indeed that justice must be
equitable. But the rider that 'justice to one
group at the cost of injustice to another
group is another way of perpetrating injustice',
without any reference to the
unequal position of the two groups, which
fact is nowhere disbelieved by the judge,
is not an argument for but against equity.
And it is an argument against reservations
as such, and not just their categorisation,
for 'justice to some at the cost of injustice
to the others' has ever been the rallying
cry of anti-reservationists. And if one is
to talk of discrimination in reverse, it is
the court's injunction against classifying
the lesser among the _dalits_ separately for
the purpose of allotting their quota to them
that deserves the appellation. For have the
same courts not held again and again that
not making a classification when it cries
out to be made amounts to treating unequals
as equals, which would truly 'earn the
wrath of _Article 14_'? It is strange that the
judge thinks it is the making of such a
classification --- whose factual basis, I must
reiterate yet once more, is not in dispute
-- attracts such wrath.

>The power of the State Legislature to decide
as regards grant of benefit of reservation
in jobs or in educational institutions to the
backward classes is not in dispute. It is
furthermore not in dispute that if such a
decision is made the State can also lay
down a legislative policy as regards extent
of reservation to be made for different
members of the backward classes including
_scheduled castes_. But it cannot take
away the said benefit on the premise that
one or the other group amongst the members
of the _scheduled castes_ has advanced
and, thus, is not entitled to the entire benefit
of reservation (S B Sinha).

The first two sentences are unexceptionable.
Indeed that would suffice to uphold
the law passed by the AP legislature. What
is difficult to even make sense of is the
last sentence. That should occasion no
surprise since we have already seen more
than one example of the judge's free flowing
use of the language of the court. To
answer it as best as one can, it must be
pointed out that the benefit of reservation
is not taken away from any one by the
subgrouping effected by the law. The law
does not identify a creamy layer among the
SCs to be divested of the right of reservation.
But if one group amongst the
_scheduled castes_ has advanced so much
that it is taking 'the entire benefit of the
reservation' (or much of it), then that
situation can certainly be remedied? How
can any one group be 'entitled to the entire
benefit of reservation' given to a whole
class? That too as a matter of right? Why
cannot that opportunity be taken away?

But S B Sinha has another objection. He
says that the provision of reservations is
subject to _Article 335_ of the Constitution,
which says that the claims of _scheduled
castes_ and _scheduled tribes_ to posts in the
services must be taken into consideration
consistently with the maintenance of efficiency
of the administration. He adds
that "(this would) lead to the conclusion
that the same cannot be done to favour less
(it should be more) weak sections, i.e., some
castes out of the homogeneous class of
_scheduled castes_". Once again, this is a
view --- the third one that I have listed ---
that hits at reservations as such, and not
just their subdivision. The courts have
never accepted _Article 335_ as a complete
bar to reservations, but S B Sinha finds
it sufficient reason to bar the giving of a
separate quota to the more backward among
the _scheduled castes_.

# 'Homogeneous' Class?

We may finally look at what the Constitution
itself says in definition of the
_scheduled castes_, and how 'homogeneous'
the class is in the view of the Constitution.
_Article 341_ has been cited above. It speaks
of 'castes, races, tribes or parts of or groups
within castes, races and tribes' which the
president in consultation with each state
governor notifies, and which shall thereupon
for the purpose of the Constitution
be deemed to be _scheduled castes_. Castes,
races, tribes or parts of or groups within
castes, races and tribes is certainly not a
very homogeneous thing? The only thing
that makes it homogeneous is that all of
them are untouchables. What would be
surprising if some of the castes, races,
tribes or parts or groups thereof are in a
position to take the full benefit of what is
given collectively to all of them? And if
that happens, why should it be assumed
that the Constitution --- which has revealed
the awareness that untouchability has
diverse social origins --- prohibits subdivision
of the reservation so that all may get
some benefit.

In answer, apart from the pronouncements
of homogeneity that abound in the
three separate and concurring judgments,
a precedent is offered by Santosh Hegde,
by misreading Murtaza Fazal Ali and
misquoting V R Krishna Iyer, both from
_State of Kerala vs N M Thomas, 1976_. That
judgment was the first time a broad view
befitting the better aspect of the Constitution
was taken by the majority of a
Constitution bench in the matter of reservations.
The judges found themselves
answering the objection that since Article
16(2) prohibits discrimination on ground
only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent,
place of birth or residence, the 'backward
class' of persons to whom reservations in
government services can be given by virtue
of _Article 16(4)_ cannot be a caste or
castes, it can only be a class.

Today it is commonplace that if a caste,
say the caste of _toddy tappers_, is identified
as a backward class for the purpose of
_Article 16(4)_, then it does not amount to
giving reservations to a caste. It only means
that _toddy tappers_ have been found to be
a backward class by virtue of some rational
criteria of backwardness, and are given
reservations as such. A caste after all is
a class in the common sense meaning that
it is a clearly defined group that is for all
practical purposes well demarcated from
the rest of society. If it is found to be
backward according to some objective and
rational criteria, then it can be the recipient
of reservations or other special provisions,
without facing the objection that there is
discrimination in favour of a caste. It took
time for the courts to arrive at this formulation,
which accounts for the tortured
language employed by the courts in the
process.

V R Krishna Iyer says in _State of Kerala
vs N M Thomas_:

>A bare reading (of Articles 341 and 342
of the Constitution) brings out the quintessential
concept that they (_scheduled castes_
and _scheduled tribes_) are no castes in the
Hindu fold but an amalgam of castes, races,
groups, tribes, communities thereof found
on investigation to be the lowliest and in
need of massive State aid and notified as
such by the president. To confuse this
backward-most social composition with
_castes_ is to commit a constitutional error,
misled by a compendious appellation. So
that, to protect _harijans_ is not to prejudice
any _caste_ but to promote citizen solidarity.
_Article 16(2)_ is out of the way and to
extend protective discrimination to this
mixed bag of tribes, castes, races, groups,
communities and non-castes outside the
fourfold Hindu division is not to compromise
with the acceleration of casteless-ness
enshrined in the sub-Article. The
discerning sense of the Indian Corpus Juries
has generally regarded _scheduled castes_
and _scheduled tribes_, not as caste but as
a large backward group deserving of societal
compassion.

Santosh Hegde quotes these lines, correcting
the word 'they' in line 2 above as
'there' for no reason at all except that it
suits his view, and says:

>According to Justice Krishna Iyer, though
there are no castes, races, groups, tribes,
communities, or parts thereof in Hinduism,
the president on investigation having
found some of the communities within the
amalgam as being lowliest and in need of
massive state aid included them in one class
called the _scheduled castes_. The sequitor
thereof is that _scheduled castes_ are one
class for the purposes of the Constitution.

It is absurd to claim that V R Krishna
Iyer or anybody for that matter could have
held that there are no castes, tribes, groups,
etc, within Hinduism. It merely serves the
purpose of drawing the conclusion that
from out of the 'amalgam' (of what?) called
Hinduism the president has picked out the
lowliest who are in need of massive state
assistance and made out of them the class
called _scheduled castes_, which is therefore
an undifferentiated, indivisible class. Judicial
reasoning could have sunk no lower.

Murtaza Fazal Ali from the same judgment
is quoted by Santosh Hegde as having
said:

>Thus in view of these provisions the
members of the _Scheduled Castes_ and the
_Scheduled Tribes_ have been given a special
status in the Constitution and they
constitute a class by themselves.

From this it is again concluded that the
communities included in the presidential
list form a class by themselves and any
'division of these persons for any consideration'
would amount to tinkering with
the presidential list. It is intriguing the way
the judge draws the conclusion of indivisibility
from the mere fact that a group of
persons constitute class in themselves. No
such conclusion automatically follows.
Logical pathologies apart, to be a class a
group merely needs to be well defined and
clearly demarcated from others. Whether
it is thereafter legitimately further classifiable
into subgroups does not follow one
way or the other from this circumstance.
A reading of Murtaza Fazal Ali's judgment
cited shows that he was in fact only
answering the objection stemming from
_Article 16(2)_, that making special provisions
for the _scheduled castes_ amounts to
giving preferential treatment in the name
of caste. No conclusion follows from this
regarding further classifiability.

But at the end S B Sinha thinks it is the
_Rellis_ and _Adi Andhras_ who are the disadvantaged
_scheduled castes_ as against the
_Malas_ and _Madigas_. The government's
case in fact is that the _Rellis_ and _Madigas_
have been inadequately served by reservation
whereas the _Malas_ and _Adi Andhras_
have benefited disproportionately. Anyway,
acknowledging that this problem is
real, S B Sinha says that a quota within
reservation is not the solution. Instead,
give them "scholarships, hostel facilities,
special coaching, etc" he says. This is the
fourth time we find a line of reasoning in
the judgment that is against reservations
as such and not merely a quota within
reservations. It has always been the argument
of upper caste anti-reservationists
that the government may provide the
backward classes with scholarships, hostel
facilities, free books, etc, but please do not
cut into our monopoly in colleges and
offices.

# Against Reservations

At the end what we have is a judgment
purportedly against subdivision of the
_scheduled caste_ reservation quota, but
which is in fact replete with arguments
against reservations as such. A little more
than a decade ago, in the Mandal Commission
case (_Indira Sawhney vs Union of
India, 1992_) nine judges of the Supreme
Court went into the whole gamut of the
reservations question and answered all the
issues, affirming some earlier judgments,
overruling some, and laying down the law
in quite a satisfactory manner. It was hoped
that most of the ghosts that have haunted
the provision of reservations/special provisions
for the oppressed castes of Hindu
society had been laid to rest.

Apparently not. But then, what more do
you expect when a section of the _dalits_
themselves go to court against those below
them, and employ all the arguments the
brahmins invented against reservations and
special provisions for the deprived castes
as such? Did they not ask for it? Did they
not lay it open to the court to once again
happily walk over what in law would be
called 'covered ground'? Every one in
Andhra Pradesh recalls the glee with which
casteist society welcomed the arguments
used by the _Malas_ against the demand
raised by the _Madigas_. There is in general
in human affairs nothing more calculated
to please than the appropriation of your
arguments by your own opponent in the
innocent assumption that he is protecting
the right obtained against you from an
encroacher. And like society, like judges,
for the tortuous reluctance with which the
courts came to accept that India is a caste
society and something should be done about
it if we are ever to be a real democracy
is evident from the history of judicial
pronouncements on reservations.

To the judges, one is tempted to read
what a predecessor of theirs said two
decades ago. In _K C Vasanth Kumar vs
State of Mysore, 1985_, O Chinnappa Reddy
said something about how the Constitution
of India, at least in its more positive
aspect, may be read:

> ...We must also remember that we are
expounding a Constitution born ...of an
anti-imperialist struggle, influenced by
constitutional instruments, events and
revolutions elsewhere, in search of a better
world, and wedded to the idea of justice,
economic, social and political to all. Such
a Constitution must be given a generous
interpretation so as to give all its citizens
the full measure of the justice promised
by it.

This probably sounds terribly like 20th
century discourse, but it was 20th century
aspirations that shaped the Republic of
India, and there is no cogent reason for
declaring that Republic dead.
