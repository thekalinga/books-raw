_Indian electoral democracy has undoubtedly led to a lot of political
awakening among the poor and the oppressed, and even a certain amount of
empowerment of these classes. But in its principal aspect it has functioned
less as a means of ascertaining and enthroning the will of the majority than
as a means of sharing out patronage, power and property among the rich
and the powerful. From the village sarpanch to the MLA, most of the elected
representatives today are leaders of gangs armed to the teeth, and the
consequent terror is a decisive factor in deciding elections._

\ 

The _Chief Election Commissioner of India_
evokes a lot of absurd images. An _unconstitutional_
temper dedicated to a constitutional
passion, a cantankerous arbitrariness
forever insistent about rectitude and
propriety in others, met from the other side
with solemn arguments about breach of
constitutional authority by politicians who
recognise no constitutional basis for the
authority they exercise, and who have so
efficiently Shaped the electoral process into
an instrument of power and plunder that they
find it infuriating that a mere public servant
can upset the rules devised and smugly
worked out among themselves, for themselves
and by themselves: that is surely a
setting that can only call forth images of
absurdity. What enrages politicians so much
about Seshan is that he is so much like them
--- arbitrary, arrogant, an unruly bully --- when he
can get away with it and a model of _humble
rectitude_ when the courts pull him up. And
while perforce the two of them debate the
matter in terms of a dubious disjunction
between --- legality and popular sovereignty
--- one may more fruitfully reflect that it is in
the nature of human affairs that all right
things are attempted by the wrong people;
that it takes excesses to make moderation
possible; that _reason_ is given a hearing only
when it is taken to unreasonable lengths;
and that it is prohibited to human beings
that right things may be achieved by right
persons using right means advocated to just
the right extent.

Seshan looks (at least in his photographs)
and behaves so much like a bull that one is
tempted to call him a _bull in a china shop_,
except that Indian politics is no chinaware,
neither in fragility nor innocence (and one
is of course not talking of aesthetics). One
could describe his effort at _electoral reform_
as tilting at windmills, except that the
windmills themselves are so genuinely scared
that there is evidently something to his effort
that is not merely quixotic. One could see
in him a _sadhu_ preaching to a _dacoit gang_,
but this is one _sadhu_ who speaks the '_dacoits_'
language. One could call him a fool rushing
in where angels know better, but then a lot
of angels appear to look forward with genuine
hope to what this fool can do.

One could, therefore, do worse than to take
Seshan a little more seriously. It requires no
great intellectual effort to recognise that
while he may trim the excesses of electoral
combats a little, he cannot finish the task of
making India a full-fledged electoral democracy.
But that little is firstly, not worthless
by itself, and secondly, in all human effort
at reform and change, what is often more
important than the material alteration
achieved is the _value-system_ generated
thereby, for that _value-system_ creates an
altered culture that shapes future social
behaviour. Human beings live by the _values_
their culture believes in, and the creation of
_new values_, the consolidation of a _new value-framework_
for human social behaviour,
which will in turn impel people to take on
the systemic obstacles to change, is what
every effort at change principally achieves.
The change achieved can only be slight in
the case of a lone effort by a cantankerous
individual whose intentions are not always
very straight or very clear, but it is nevertheless
worth taking seriously. In particular,
it is important to look at the cultural and
systemic obstacles that Seshan's effort
--- taken deservedly or not it face value --- will
have to face in the hinterland of Indian
democracy.

The people of Kurnool district in the
Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh have
had election after election forced upon them,
while the discerning among them know better
than anybody else that their society and
culture are least ready for electoral democracy
of any kind. First, the parliament member
from Nandyal resigned and the people were
directed to elect the nation's prime minister
to parliament, and with a record lead to boot.
And then Vijaya Bhaskar Reddy, the member
of parliament from Kurnool and union law
minister, was made chief minister of the
state, which meant that he too had to be
elected to the state assembly. Panyam was
vacated for him and the people were directed
to elect the chief minister ("otherwise there
will be no development for Kurnool"). They
did their best and did elect him, but the 'big
man' was not happy with the votes he did
not get. He said in public meeting after
public meeting after getting elected, that he
knew who had campaigned against him and
would 'take care of them, whether they are
high or low'. And then, of course, the
parliament seat of Kurnool vacated by him
had to be filled, and who should be the
Congress candidate but his son? It was his
seat that he had vacated, to "serve"
the people better, and who should the "inheritance"
go to but his dear son, whether according
to the Hindu or any other property law? And
so the people of Kurnool were directed to
elect the son to parliament on May 26 this
year, and they have dutifully done so, except
that he scraped through with a rather small
lead. So base is the people's ingratitude,
even to men that have "served" them for decades
and are bent on "serving" them forever, from
father to son, from father to son, from father
to son ...

# ELECTIONS IN KURNOOL

But that is not our story. Our story is what
exactly does the electoral process mean in
a district like Kurnool; and what must happen
before electoral democracy becomes a thing
of substance there; and how little of it comes
within the purview of the Election Commission
--- whether that consists of one, two
or three members; whether there is a chief
among them who is more equal than the
others; and whether that chief will be Seshan
in perpetuity. This is of course not at all to
say that what the EC can do is altogether
immaterial, nor that the recent debate about
its reconstitution is a vacuous debate. The
people of Kurnool themselves did not think
so during the _by-election_ this May. The least
literate of them had heard of this _miracle man_
called Seshan who had put the fear of the
law in the hearts of the lawless lords of their
lives, and they were so curious to know what
the creature looks like that when Seshan
stopped off at a small town in Kurnool
constituency on the way to Mantralayam (he
seems to visit gods as frequently as politicians
do), villagers flocked around as if he were
a film star.

Jagadurti is a village off the Hyderabad-Bangalore
national highway. It is ruled by
former _sarpanch_ Lakshmi Reddy, an elderly
man, an uncle of sorts of chief minister
Vijaya Bhaskar Reddy. This old man
evidently belongs to an era that pre-dates
even notional democracy, for he takes pride
in the fact that there is little of it in his village.
No sir, nobody campaigns for any party
other than the party he supports --- which
happens to be the Congress but could well
be the _Telugu Desam Party_ some day --- in
his village. It has never happened, and it
would be improper if it ever did happen.
He himself sits as the _poll agent_ inside the
booth, and people show him the stamped
_ballot paper_ before consigning it to the box.
It has always been so. It is a tradition of
the village, and it would be improper if
anybody violated it today. Will the opposition
party find a _poll agent_ in the village?
Well, nobody from the village would actually
sit as an _opposition agent_ in the
village, for that would also be improper and
contrary to the traditions of the village. But
since it is said that according to some
statutory vanity all candidates have a right
to have their _agents_ in every booth, even
if they are so poorly off that nobody from
the village will sit on their behalf, well then,
they can get an _agent_ from outside, and he
would be treated as an _honoured guest_,
according to the _village traditions_. But such
an _agent_ should in turn respect the _village
traditions_ and not behave impolitely. That
would be improper. Finally, he has heard
of some stupid electoral rule or fancy that
all the votes of a village cannot be cast for
a single candidate, even if the village has
no tradition of differing in such matters, and
that if there is a hundred percent unanimity
there will be a repoll, which he thinks is
utterly stupid and undemocratic --- but as such
is the law --- he himself sees to it that the
opposition candidate gets the last 10 per
cent of the votes. The people will be directed
to vote for the _worthless fellow_.

This is not an isolated village. There are
plenty of villages in the district where
landlords who are close relatives or followers
of the chief minister rule life with such completeness.
What happens to those who resist
their authority? They can be killed. They can
be banished from the village and their property
destroyed or seized. It should not be thought
this violence is committed by some paid
_agents_ or hirelings of the landlord. The
landlord's loyal following would normally
consist of quite ordinary villagers who would
_lynch_ the disobedient with a genuine sense
of outrage. There is for instance this complaint
made by the _Telugu Desam Party (TDP)_ to the _Chief
Election Commissioner_ about the _SI_ of police,
Kodumur, who they alleged had forced a
_TDP_ supporter to remove the party flag and
banner from his house. The _SI_'s explanation
is that the man's village is close to the chief
minister's native village Laddagiri, right on
the road in fact, from Laddagiri to the _mandal_
headquarters, and so if this man continued
to sport _TDP_ insignia he would cause needless
provocation to the men of Laddagiri
passing by, and as the loyalty of that village
to Vijaya Bhaskar Reddy's family is well
known, that would have fatal consequences.
That is why, the _SI_ insists, he had advised
the _TDP_ supporter, in his own interest and
as part of the policeman's official duty to
"prevent" _cognisable offences_, to remove the
party banner and flag and "silently vote for
the _TDP_ in the anonymity of the polling
booth if he wanted to", an act of thoughtful
charity and dutiful policing that the _TDP_
leaders misunderstood. Whatever the honesty
of the policeman's explanation, the fact that
he chose this as a credible explanation reveals
a lot about society in rural Kurnool.

There is another Lakshmi Reddy, an even
closer uncle of the chief minister, who rules
over the village of Lakkasagaram, This is an
airtight monarchy into which not a single
whiff of liberty has ever entered. Even N T
Rama Rao on his electoral visits to the area
would pass by this village and hold meetings
elsewhere. A stranger who enters the village
cannot and will not be allowed to talk to the
residents directly. The residents themselves
would be either too scared to talk or would
regard such liberty quite sincerely as an
outrage. Any talking that is to be done will
be done by Lakshmi Reddy, and that is that.
It would be difficult to convince many (though
mercifully not all) people of the village that
there is anything wrong in this.

It can be argued (and landlords frequently
do argue) that quite apart from the last 10
per cent or so of the votes that those who
rule the village will themselves direct to be
cast for the opposition in case of uncomfortable
unanimity in the village, there
is nothing at all to prevent at least the
courageous of the dissenters from voting for
the opposition in the anonymity of the polling
booth (and if you do not have the courage,
why ever should you dissent?). The possibility
certainly does exist, and seems to have been
utilised is sizeable measure this May, going
by the final result. And the possibility has
certainly been enhanced by Seshan. The
earlier practice was either that the voter shows
the stamped _ballot paper_ to the _landlord's
agent_ sitting inside the booth before putting
it in the box; or that the _polling agent_ would
himself stamp each _ballot paper_ and hand
it over the voter to personally put in the box,
as a token of democracy; or worse still that
four or five of the landlord's men would
themselves stamp all the _ballot papers_
(including some in favour of the opposition)
without troubling voters to come all the way
to the booth, and put them all in the box,
in the presence of the gaping poll officials.
And there would be no _opposition agent_
sitting in the booth to protest; or if there is
one and that one did protest, or if the
representatives of the opposition candidate
came there and protested, there would be
bomb-throwing and violence and possibly
a murder or two. Seshan's insistence on
deploying large contingents of paramilitary
at the booths, and on strictly preventing big
groups of persons from moving around on
poll day has encouraged the _TDP_ to send its
_agents_ from outside the district to each booth
to protest at every malpractice. They could
not prevent all impersonation, for the _agents_
from outside could not possibly know who
is who in each village, and where they did
try --- in Vijaya Bhaskar Reddy's native village
Laddagiri --- they were physically driven out
of the village. Yet the presence of the police
and the _opposition poll agents_ did cut down
the rigging in most villages. The decision
of the Election Commission not to count
votes booth-wise, which would reveal which
locality voted sizeably for whom, also gave
courage to the voters to exercise their choice
more freely than ever.

# LIMITED CHANGE

All this has helped, and many have publicly
acknowledged the victory of Seshan in
making the recent _by-election_ to the Kurnool
parliament seat more democratic than any
election before it in the district. And yet
elections are not won by voters deciding in
the secret of their hearts whom to vote for
and exercising that choice in the secret of
the polling booth. The liberty to campaign
and create a climate of opinion in favour of
the opposition candidate is an essential aspect
of electoral democracy, and this is where the
rules and procedures of the Election
Commission are of little help against the
entrenched social terror exercised by the
armed landlords. It is impossible to provide
heavy police escort for every campaign
meeting of every candidate in every village.
And even if that were possible, that would
only apply to the campaign meetings held
by outsiders coming to the village, meetings
of the kind that are by their nature possibly
at most once in each village of a constituency
even in the most intense campaign. One
cannot think of any security at all for villagers
living in the village and campaigning by
word of mouth in the village. Even if they
go unmolested prior to the poll out of fear
of the action that the very arbitrary and
unpredictable Seshan may take, after the poll
is over, the result is declared, Seshan's men
are back in Delhi, and Seshan's jurisdiction
over the happenings in Kurnool is terminated.
There can and will be retaliatory murders and
arson targeted at those in the village who
openly sided with the opposition candidate.
Tell anti-Congress voters in Kurnool to
exercise not merely their vote but the whole
gamut of their political liberty freely, and
they will ask you in return: "Will you be with
us in the village after the poll is over? You
won't? Then don't advise us".

Apart from the liberty to differ from the
'big men' of the village and openly express
the difference, what is even more basically
required is a culture in which such liberty
is recognised and prized. Whereas what
prevails in Rayalaseema is a culture in which
the human traits of loyalty and faith are tied
to the feudal-patriarchal mode of society, so
that the liberty we are speaking of may well
be seen as an illegitimate disloyalty to the
natural leaders and elder of society, and
would be recognised as legitimate only if
there is an opposition faction within the
dominant class to whom the loyalty can be
transferred. Existing conjointly as this trait
does with a proneness to violent expression
of anger, which is again sharper in Rayalaseema
than elsewhere, it can mean that the
desire for individual liberty may attract
violent hostility from one's own fellow
creatures, persons of one's own class, caste
and family. Even in factional conflicts
among followers of different _Reddy_ landlords,
the violent anger and hatred that can
and does divide close kith and kin is startling
to an observer unfamiliar with the
specific mode of feudal culture dominant
in Rayalaseema.

If we leave aside the generality of the
feudal-patriarchal culture, not every village
of Kurnool or any of the Rayalaseema districts
answers completely to the above description.
There are plenty of villages where some
degree of freedom from social terror does
exist. But there are equally plenty of villages
which landlords such as the two Lakshmi
Reddys described above rule totally with
their gangs armed invariably with country-made
bombs, and often also guns. Over the
last decade and half, Rayalaseema warlordism
has constituted itself into a structure that has
--- MLAs and ministers at the top; civil and
excise contractors, smugglers and less disreputable
businessmen at the middle; and
village landlords at the base. It determines
and dominates all spheres of political as well
as civil society. Chief minister Vijaya Bhaskar
Reddy has for long been a seemingly
gentlemanly operator situated in the upper
echelons of this warlord structure, though
after becoming chief minister he has shown
that he possesses quite ungentlemanly fangs
in addition to a gentlemanly demeanour.

The guns at one time used to be mostly
illegal weapons acquired or made at home.
The bombs, of course, are made locally, and
(Manmohan Singh, please take note) if the
manufacture is legalised and its extent
properly estimated it would make a sizeable
addition to the GDP of Rayalaseema without
any further investment. The people themselves
joke that bombs are as cheaply
available as putrefied vegetables. But in the
last five years or so guns have also multiplied
in number and gun licences are easier to
obtain now as quite a few of the warlords
have risen to important positions in the
state government. Vijaya Bhaskar Reddy,
Mysoora Reddy and Diwakar Reddy (from
Kurnool, Cuddapah and Anantapur districts,
in that order) have been and are in powerful
positions. And the principal Congress
dissident, YS Rajasekhar Reddy from
Cuddapah is an archetypal warlord. Gun
licences are therefore much easier to obtain,
with their own men at the top. You commit
a murder and apply for a gun licence as you
fear retaliation, for the police have 'falsely
implicated you in the case'; the kith and kin
of the deceased apply for a gun licence
exhibiting the corpse of the man you have
slain as proof of a _bona fide_ threat to life.
As both of you have your own men as MLAs
and ministers at Hyderabad, both get gun
licences in due course. The granting of such
licences is supposed to be preceded by a local
police enquiry concerning the applicant's
criminal proclivities, but such inconveniences
are easily avoided. As policemen bemoan
these days:

>These fellows do not even give
their home addresses in the application. They
give a Hyderabad address and get hold of
some MLA or minister who ensures that the
local police dutifully certify that the man has
no criminal record locally and get the licence,
and it is only when we see the fellow going
around with a gun back home that we realise
he has gone and got a gun licence.

The point is that this weaponry increases
the terror they exercise. The terror is a means
of property acquisition; it is a means of
political power and patronage. All manner
of petty local bullies gather around these
armed lords, and constitute a formidable
obstacle to any democratic assertion --- whether
electoral or otherwise.

These armed gangs are anachronistically
described as 'rural factions' in police and
administrative parlance, though they have
evidently outgrown their origins in village
factionalism. It is a paradox that they are
today seen (though not always vocally
condemned) as an obstacle to democracy
and development, for it is precisely the kind
of political democracy and the kind of
economic development that India has had
that is at the root of the evolution of warlord
gangs from their pre-independence roots in
what may be properly called village
factionalism. Village factions born of conflict
between _Reddy_ landlords (but also a few
_non-Reddy_ landlords and elders of close-knit
castes as the _Boyas_, too) over property
and power (and sometimes women) have
a long history in the Rayalaseema districts.
Every slight --- imagined or real --- had to be
avenged as viciously as every substantial
challenge to one's power, property or prestige.
Assault, murder and burning of houses and
cornstacks was the principal means of the
assertion of one's strength and 'manhood'.
And, of course, each such attack had to be
avenged with equal 'manliness' from the
other side. This meant the creation of
hereditary enmity that went on from
generation to generation, often until one
family was either exterminated or driven out
of the village. It also meant the creation of
loyal gangs from out of poorer castemen and
lower castes by each warring side, and as
the gangs indulged in mutual violence,
subsidiary enmity between fresh families
lower down the social scale would be created.
These gangs (even today) are different from
urban mafias in two respects: one is that they
are made up not of professional criminals
but peasants (though they do involve
themselves in illicit activity such as
smuggling forest produce, growing opium
or making liquor illegally), and the second
is that what binds the gang to the master is not
only pecuniary or other material benefit
(though there is often plenty of it) but also
an intense feudal loyalty, the loyalty owed
as a matter of traditional '_dharma_' --- to the
'elders' of the village --- which means either
upper caste landlords or the hereditary elders
of each caste, especially the tight-knit castes
such as the very militant and clannish _Boyas_.
Over this factionalism was super-imposed
another trait that Rayalaseema inherited
from the anarchy that followed the demise
of the 'war state' of the _Rayas_ of Vijayanagar:
the rule of armed chieftains (sometimes called
'_polegars_') over groups of villages, a few or
hundreds in extent, a rule that amounted to
little more than plain plunder by the chieftain
and his violent gang of castemen and
followers.

The British did their bit to subdue this two-tiered
feudal structure of violence, or at least
to come to terms with it. They failed, no
doubt because for them, it represented merely
a problem of public order and crime. But
political democracy and economic development
of the post-in dependence period has
peculiarly enhanced, politicised and modernised
the phenomenon. Indian electoral
democracy has undoubtedly led to a lot of
political awakening among the poor and the
oppressed, and even a certain amount of
empowerment of these classes. But in its
principal aspect it has functioned less as a
means of ascertaining and enthroning the
will of the majority than as a means of
sharing out patronage, power and property
among the rich and the powerful. It has
functioned too as a means of recanalising the
forms of traditional power and property into
modern channels. And therefore, the violence
of the armed landlord factions has fitted
neatly into electoral combat, while the
sanctity and the position of an 'elected
representative' has lent ideological legitimacy
as well as some amount of 'state power'
to the erstwhile armed lord. From the village
_sarpanch_ to the MLA, most of the elected
representatives today are leaders of gangs
armed to the teeth, and the consequent terror
is a decisive factor in deciding elections.

# QUARRY-BASED ECONOMY

As for economic development in Rayalaseema,
the semi-arid region has little potential
for growth based on agricultural prosperity,
It is on the other hand rich in minerals and
commercially valuable slab stone, and
hence quarrying and processing is a major
economic activity. This rough work suits the
rough culture of the region, and it was soon
enough discovered that whoever controls the
gun and the bomb also controls the quarry-based
industry and trade. The guns and the
gangs that had first come into being in village
factional fights turned their attention --- just
as they turned their attention to electoral
politics --- to the quarrying and polishing of
stone. The units are allowed to be owned and
operated by harmless entrepreneurs(it is
too much of bother looking after the
economics of running the enterprises)
and the armed warlord gangs step in as
'protectors' and collect tolls on every piece
of material quarried or shifted out.

And then there are the civil and excise
contracts offered by the public sector economy,
such as contracts for the laying of
roads, the digging of canals and the vending
of liquor in retail. Indeed, everything monopolised
by the state, whether it is forests,
public works or liquor, creates contractors
in its execution, transport and retail vending,
and if you can drive out all competitors at
the auction you can take the contract for a
high profit margin, and then either execute
it, or (if that is too much of a bother) subcontract
it out to somebody else. Once again,
therefore, the bomb and the gun helped to
create a monopoly in public works and other
contracts. Territory is parcelled out among
the warlords into zones where none competes
against another, and if any outsider
enters the fray he is either politely bought
out or abruptly bombed out.

Thus, the economy and politics of post-independence
India helped develop the
feuding village factions into big mafias that
use armed terror as a decisive means of
dominating politics and the economy. And
also, gradually, the whole of social life. All
social problems and conflicts end up at the
palatial houses of the warlords, to be decided
with the threat or infliction of violence, and
according to the very primitive notions of
equity, morality and fairness that the warlords
possess. Disputes of property, contract,
marriage, divorce and every conceivable
familial and inter-personal problem finds
an abrupt and final resolution there; The
problems are robbed of their delicacy, sensitivity,
robbed of their social, political and
ethical dimensions and reduced either to the
customary feudal-patriarchal notions of
rectitude or --- one does not know whether
this is worse or better --- mere calculation of
factional political advantage.

It is in such a society that we are speaking
of the Election Commission's _dicta_. Till now,
in faction-ridden villages of Rayalaseema,
the people have had some freedom only
when two gangsters are at loggerheads,
thereby giving the people a chance to 'play
one devil against the other' as the people
themselves say. But looking at it this way
involves romanticising the people as helpless
victims of armed gangs, whereas a lot
of them are --- simultaneously and knowingly
--- loyal partisans in the warfare. They are not
an innocent entity waiting to be liberated
from the mafias but are in sizeable measure
faithful and conscious participants in the
violence and the terror that robs their society
of democracy and justice. One may then
(following a strong current philosophical
fashion) question this notion of democracy
and justice as alien, occidental or elitist, but
the test is not an eclectic relativism that
decrees to each what they believe they want,
but whether a given social structure 'and
culture, and the way they mould human
traits in society, are conducive to the promotion
of a life which assures the full development
of each person (concurrently with the
full development of all). If this criterion too
is described as a western value, one can
either point out that there is a grain of it in
the Buddha, or else say so much the worse
for the east-west dichotomy.

Without the notion of a democracy and
justice that transcends the feudal-patriarchal
culture of Rayalaseema, the only freedom
available to people within the culture, a
freedom that they exercise with great
violence, is the freedom to change masters
and suffer more violence in the process.
The May 26 _by-election_ in Kurnool saw
explicit group violence and police firing at
the village of Eerladinne. This village is
close to Kothakota, the native village of
Prakash Reddy, nephew of the chief minister.
Only a few years ago, this bearded young
man was regarded as Vijay a Bhaskar Reddy's
political heir. Government officials in
Kurnool did his bidding though he was not
even an MLA. And it was this man that
master-minded the shameless drama of
abduction and wrongful confinement of
prospective candidates at the time of P V
Narasimha Rao's Nandyal election. He was
also at the forefront of the massive rigging
that heralded the prime minister's entry to
parliament. It was predicted that this Prakash
Reddy would rise to heights in the state's
politics.

But he was only a nephew and not the son.
That was his tragedy. For the chief minister
does have a son, Suryaprakash Reddy by
name, apparently a good-for-nothing in
political warfare, but a son nevertheless.
Gradually the son rose and the nephew set,
and when the son was openly promoted as
the Congress candidate for the Kurnool bypoll,
the nephew defected to the eager _Telugu
Desam Party_, which habitually waits at the
back door to lap up disenchanted Congress
gangsters as they come out, and spends time
in the interval lecturing the people about the
evils of the culture of the gun promoted by
the Congress in Rayalaseema. Having joined
the _TDP_, Prakash Reddy vowed to defeat the
chief minister's son.

Eerladinne is one of the half a dozen villages
in the neighbourhood of Prakash Reddy's
native Kothakota, that were entirely under
that man's thumb. They had lived in feudal
peace, voting and living as Prakash Reddy
desired. The obedience, as we have said
above, is due partly to the traditional and
willing loyalty that a powerful _Reddy_
commands, and partly to the terror induced
by the proximity of his guns. When such
leaders switch parties, the people too normally
switch their electoral loyalties. Thus, soon
there was the strange sight of all the walls
in Kothakota being adorned with yellow-coloured
posters of a smiling N T Rama Rao,
whereas that man would not have been able
to do so much as hold an election rally in
the village in the past.

But Eerladinne alone of the domain of
Prakash Reddy did not switch over
completely. A couple of local Reddys decided
to stay with the chief minister, and so the
village split into two, one section passionately
loyal to Prakash Reddy in his new apparel
and the other full of a new-found passion
against him. As it happened, the election
booth was located near the houses of those
loyal to Prakash Reddy. On poll day, when
the renegades went to vote, the loyalists
deliberately picked up a quarrel with them
and chased them away with a rain of stones
and sticks. But the renegades were not
deterred. They regrouped by afternoon and
went in a bunch in a couple of tractors and
voted for the Congress, defying the loyalists'
wrath. This defiance is undoubtedly a
democratic assertion, but in the interest of
another _Reddy_, And moreover soon they
may have to pay heavily for it if the _Telugu
Desam Party_ comes to power, a not unlikely
eventuality in the coming elections, in which
case Prakash Reddy is bound to become a
powerful man.

Not all of India is Kurnool, but there is
a little bit of Kurnool in the most civilised
part of the country. And there are, of course,
whole regions of the country, including
certain metropolitan slums, that are no
different from Kurnool. What ever form and
meaning we give to electoral democracy as
an instrument of _representative government_,
the social structure and culture of a sizeable
part of India is a hindrance to it. Much
change needs to take place at the level of
social structure and culture before it can
become genuinely representative, once again
whatever formal alterations may be made.
While this has been so for a long time, the
fast deterioration of the political establishment
that we see today has its concomitant
in an increasing resort to suppressive violence
by the rich and the powerful, a violence
against which the unorganised weak have no
defence unless they happen to be part of a
rival gang.

This situation is enough to defeat any
bureaucratic attempt to make democratic
political choice in elections a reality. To say
this is not to advocate defeatism but to point
out that the task of evolving a genuine
representative democracy in India is much
bigger than would be deduced from the debate
centred on P V Narasimha Rao's childish
attempts to cut Seshan to size. It is a much
more difficult, cultural and political task
than voting against the constitutional
amendment dreamt up by a prime minister
whose imagination cannot rise above that of
a village _patwari_.
