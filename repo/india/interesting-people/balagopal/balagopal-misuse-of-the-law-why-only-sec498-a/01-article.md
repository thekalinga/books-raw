A couple of weeks ago, an organisation purportedly working for 'responsive legal action and
speedy justice', headed by a lawyer, organised a seminar on the 'misuse of _Sec 498-A_ of the
_Indian Penal Code_'. A sitting judge of the High Court was the Chief Guest and the Registrar of
the High Court was to preside over the gathering. _Sec 498-A_ --- in case you did not know --- makes
domestic cruelty (including mental harassment) of a woman at the hands of her husband and his
relations a penal offence. Making it clear that the gathering was not meant to discuss the both the
good and bad aspects of the law and its use, but was exclusively meant for discussing its misuse,
the organisers put up a notice in the City's Courts declaring that (apart from lawyers and social
activists) only husbands and in-laws were invited. In other words, harassed wives were explicitly
barred from the meeting.

Outraged at the idea that a sitting judge of the High Court, who would be called upon day in and
day out to adjudicate complaints of domestic cruelty impartially if not dispassionately, should
agree to address such a tendentious gathering --- a group of determined women all but disrupted the
meeting that evening. But unwittingly, the organisers of that evening's gathering had let out a
secret that few people other than lawyers know: that in our Courts it is now very commonly and
casually said that _Sec 498-A_ is routinely misused by women. What began as a cynical comment
made by lawyers in the course of argument in defence of husbands, soon turned into a frequent
off-the-cuff comment made by Judges hearing cases, and has now entered written judgements. It
achieved some kind of sanctity by the Supreme Court's observations in a case where it felt that
the entire family of the husband was wantonly dragged into the offence by the wife. Such
observations of the Supreme Court arising from the facts of a particular case (whether justified or
not) are not supposed to lay down any quotable law, but not if you like what the Supreme Court
has said.

The lawyer-judge fraternity, which is 95% male, likes it.

Not to be left behind --- a judge of our High Court --- known otherwise for his concern for the
downtrodden, made an identical comment in the course of adjudicating a case, and his prejudice,
which is no more law than that of the Supreme Court, is now being relied upon by judges of
lower Courts to dismiss complaints filed by harassed wives.

I am not arguing that _Sec 498-A_ of the _Indian Penal Code_ is not misused at all. Every law is
misused. But when lawyers and judges go around saying this, one is entitled to ask a few
questions. One, no law can be misused unless lawyers teach people to misuse it. True complaints
may be given by the victims on their own, but every false complaint is drafted by a lawyer. If
any law is being misused that is because lawyers have taught people to misuse it. When lawyers,
as a profession, find it impossible to take the decision that they will not twist the law to serve the
dubious purposes of their clients (and of course make money for themselves), and will not
tolerate their colleagues who do so, they have the least right, as a profession, to talk about misuse
of any law in the abstract, as if some mysterious creatures are responsible for the misuse. And a
judiciary which habitually winks at abuse of the _process of law_ by lawyers should not be heard
echoing the complaint.

Two, lawyers and judges of all people should not forget that laws are made to serve some
purpose, to prevent some harm, to repair some unacceptable damage, and the first thing one
should ask about a law is whether it is serving the intended purpose. Anything else, including its
misuse, is a subsequent consideration. _Sec 498-A_ of the _Indian Penal Code_ has had very little effect
on the evil it was intended to remedy: namely the harassment women are subjected to in the
marital home. There is no evidence that the enactment of the legislation has proved a deterrent to
wife-beating or any other form of harassment --- physical or mental. And the Courts have not
exactly covered themselves with glory in interpreting the provision to give effect to its purpose.
On the contrary, another judge of our High Court has recently put it down in a judgement that it
is not harassment if a husband exerts pressure upon his wife to transfer in his name the property
given to her by her father. The view is plainly unlawful, but it is now the view of our High Court,
and will continue to be so until some hapless woman gets it modified by a larger Bench.

With increasing commercialisation and de-humanisation of human relations, the trend of
harassment is on the other hand on the increase. A focused discussion on the law would begin
with its ineffectiveness in attaining its legislative purpose. To begin the discussion with its
misuse would only serve to delegitimise the law, and stall what little help it could give to
women.

Three, why talk of only _Sec 498-A_, or the _S.C & S.T (Prevention of Atrocities) Act_ --- the other
law whose misuse is a frequent topic of discussion in Bar associations and Court halls? Is it
entirely a coincidence that the only statutory provisions whose misuse agitates the legal
profession and the judiciary are provisions meant to give some protection to the largest
disadvantaged sections of our population --- Women, _Dalits_ and _Adivasis_? Why not hold seminars on
the misuse of Tax laws? or Building regulations? or Company law and 'sickness' law? These
are routinely misused, and about Tax laws one may fairly say that they are meant only for being
misused. Many eminent lawyers have built much-envied careers around the misuse of these laws,
but nobody is seen complaining. Why get angry only about misuse of the law concerning
domestic harassment, and the law of atrocities on _Dalits_ and _Adivasis_?
