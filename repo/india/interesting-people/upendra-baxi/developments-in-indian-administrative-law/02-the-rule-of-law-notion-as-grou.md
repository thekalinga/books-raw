# THE RULE OF LAW NOTION AS GROUNDNORMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

The concept of the "rule of law" is the mainspring of the principles of administrative law. Over a period of time, the concept has been operationalized as meaning absence, or at any rate diminution, of arbitrariness in the exercise of public power. The Constitution embodies many facets of this concept in several of its provisions, including those of Part III which guarantee fundamental rights. The Indian experience is rather unique in that the courts, and particularly the Supreme Court, had to pronounce their understandings of the concept repeatedly. In Kesavananda[^3] there occurred a refreshing dialogue on the issue whether the concept of the rule of law was itself an aspect of the doctrine of basic structure of the Constitution, which even the plenary power of Parliament cannot reach to amend. The dialogue continued among justices of the Supreme Court during the internal emergency of 1975--77. In Indira Nehru Gandhi[^4] an amendment to the Constitution (immunizing the election dispute involving the Prime Minister from any kind of judicial review), was invalidated by Khanna and Chandrachud, on the ground that it violated the concept of the rule of law, which was an aspect of the basic structure. Other Justices did not take this route to invalidation complaining in essence that the concept cannot possess a "brooding omnipresence over the specific provisions of the Constitution. In the Habeas Corpus case,[^5] the argument was pressed that the executive cannot even in times of an emergency, entailing suspension of the bill of rights, act in violation of the concept of the rule of law as the "obligation to act in accordance with the rule of law ... is a central feature of our constitutional system and is a basic feature of the Constitution". Although there was some confusion as to the status of the concept during the period of the emergency and some justices went so far as to suggest that the emergency provisions themselves constitute the rule of law during such a regime, the opinions closely read do suggest the conclusion that the contention of the petitioners was accepted in the reasoning of all the five opinions, though unfortunately not in result.[^6] The result was a carelessly drafted order, as the court was itself to later so characterize,[^7] which left detenus with no remedy against any arbitrary exercise of authority. But despite this distortion, whose severe consequences were tragically documented in a denial of all judicial relief even as regards the conditions of detention,[^8] Kesavananda, Indira Gandhi and the Habeas Corpus cases provide a distillation of Indian judicial thought on the conceptions of the rule of law, which has evolved well over a quarter century. References to Western theories and thinkers from Dicey onwards abound in these opinions; but these occur by way of rhetorical flourishes, masking the typically Indian approaches.

When one reflects upon decisional law in this area, one finds that the concept of the rule of law thus developed has several components. One is that power should not be exercised arbitrarily. This has meant that it should be exercised for the purposes for which it has been conferred.[^9] It also means that power should be exercised within the statutory ambit; and purported exercise of it would not just be ultra vires but, in a true sense of the term, arbitrary. Simple negation of arbitrariness is, however, not enough to preserve the rule of law values. Indian courts have gone further to insist on specific positive content of the rule of law obligations. These include the rules of natural justice which have to be followed not just in quasi-judicial action but often also in purely administrative action.[^10] The scope and content of the requirements of natural justice have varied from time to time according to the judicial interpretation; but the broad insistence remains. In addition, access to information as to the grounds of decision has remained an important preoccupation of the Indian judiciary, as any impediments to it have the tendency of obstructing judicial review of administrative action. This means that the courts have from time to time insisted that exercise of administrative power be accompanied by reasons,[^11] although the exact status of the obligation to give reasons is as yet indeterminate.[^12]

The rule of law notion has been in addition consistently extended to secure for the individual fair dealing by the State in its economic activities. For example, the government is held bound by its assurances to individuals in business transactions by way of estoppel.[^13] The State has to follow some of the rules of natural justice before reaching a decision that it would not trade with certain contractors or before blacklisting them.[^14] In matters involving government contracts, the courts have been increasingly keen to insist that the ambit of fairplay is not lessened in view of the dominating capacity of the State over the individuals.[^15] In the area of losses and injury arising out of the State economic entrepreneurial function, courts have tended to restrict the scope of the defence of sovereign immunity in favour of the affected individuals.[^16] We review the decisional law on some of these matters in this chapter. Suffice it to say here that the rule of law concept as evolved by the Indian judiciary extends not just to providing a framework of negative constraints on governmental action but also to impositions of specific fairness duties on the State. In quite a few respects, then, the Indian administrative law transcends the inspiration and models of judicial intervention found in cosmopolitan jurisprudence of Anglo-American decisional law; although judicial discourse remains suffused with quite deceptive reliance on these very sources.
