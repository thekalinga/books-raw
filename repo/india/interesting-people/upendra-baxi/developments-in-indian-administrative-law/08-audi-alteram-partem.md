# AUDI ALTERAM PARTEM

The maxim audi alteram partem, evolved through centuries of Western historical experience, is now a part of all civilized legal systems. But in its operationalization it has been attended with many a fascinating twist and turn in different legal systems. Much has depended from time to time on the ability of courts to classify functions as purely administrative and quasi-judicial. The requirement of a hearing to the affected individual is seen to be a necessity of justice, particularly attaching to action which has the effect of adjudicating rights or status through the exercise of public power. But the drawing of the lines has been a difficult, and often an agonizing, process for courts everywhere, as it has invariably entailed subjective appreciation of peculiar fact situations rooted in the desire somehow to balance" accountability in administration with efficiency. In India, the situation is no different, despite the fact that in view of the constitutional provisions the principles of natural justice are supposed to have much wider application in Indian law than in English law".[^94]

The Indian courts have struggled with two kinds of questions. First, when does the right of hearing accrue to an affected individual? Second, what ought to be the precise ambit of rights coalescing under the rubric "right to a hearing"? To expect crystal-clear answers to either type of question is to entertain some univocal, and even arrogant, conception of justice. Yet, some judicial trends appear tolerably clear. As we have already seen with respect to the first question, courts have held that a right to a hearing accrues not merely when the statutes provide for it but when statutes can be so read as to provide, particularly in the context of administrative adjudication. The courts retain the discretion to label an action quasi-judicial and thus engraft or entrench the right to a hearing even if the statute is. silent.

Of course, the right to a hearing has been usually provided for by a large number of statutes in British as well as post-colonial India. "As a result", one observer has explained, the "Indian courts developed a habit of looking to statutes for rules of hearing".[^95] This judicial working habit, or style, has extended itself in support of a rule of interpretation that if the statute is silent on the requirements of hearing, such requirements may be read into them as a responsible legislature could not be deemed to have excluded by implication a time-honoured principle of justice. This approach is greatly facilitated in India by the provisions of fundamental rights, especially by Article 14 guaranteeing equality before the law.

But despite the requirements of the fundamental rights provisions, there remains considerable uncertainty as to whether statutory exclusion, in express terms, of the right to a hearing would be held justified. It appears to be the accepted position that statutes so excluding hearing in areas which do not directly affect any fundamental rights would be constitutionally valid. As for the statutes affecting fundamental rights, the Indian Supreme Court has wavered in its approach during the last twenty-seven years, from Gopalan[^96] to Maneka.[^97]

In Gopalan some Justices went so far as to suggest that the fundamental right not to be deprived of life and personal liberty save by "procedure established by law" really meant that Parliament can prescribe any law so long as it is within its competence. Twenty seven years saw some attenuation of this judicial views culminating in Maneka. But even this historic decision does not fully entrench the requirement of the right to hearing as an an essential attribute of law prescribed by Parliament. In Maneka, the court first reads a right to hearing in the Passport Act as an implicit statutory prerequiste for impounding of passports and then proceeds to hold that in some situations even a post-decisional hearing will suffice.[^98] The notion of post-decisional hearing as satisfying fairness requirements in the area of fundamental rights is a novel addition to the audi alteram partem rule; an addition, however, of dubious significance in terms of development of an ethos of legality in administration.[^99]

The right to a hearing of course, means the right to a meaningful hearing and not a right to the ritual of hearing, an "empty exercise in public relations".[^100] This is easy to state in the abstract. But what constitutes meaningful hearing is a question on which judicial practice varies. There is consensus that effective notice is essential to the right of being heard.[^101] But beyond that there is considerable diversity of approach and views. "Hearing" does not necessarily mean personal hearing through parties appearance before the decisionmaker.[^102] All that the reasonable hearing standard requires is that adequate opportunity be given to the party concerned to present his point of view on allegations or disputes.[^103] This shifts the focus of discussion to what constitutes "effective" or "adequate" hearing.

Indian courts have broadly held that effective hearing implies access to information and access to the adjudicating authority by the affected individual. The authority must disclose all materials, evidence and information relevant to the decision on issues involved; and the individual should have the opportunity to rebut this material.[^104] In addition, the authority must receive from the affected individual all relevant material which he wishes to produce.[^105] The right to an effective hearing does not frequently include a right to cross-examine witnesses, except in rather special circumstances,[^106] nor right to counsel as a matter of entitlement.[^107] As regards the requirement of reasoned decisions, until 1965 judicial insistence was lacking; now quasi-judicial bodies are required to give some reasons for their decisions, although the question of their sufficiency remains a vexed one.[^108] It remains particularly vexed on the issue of whether the appellate authority must give a reasoned decision even when it agrees with lower authority. Some decisions since 1965 suggest that such authorities were required to give reasons, whether in agreement or in difference from the initial decisions.[^109] But in 1973 the Supreme Court has ruled that reasoned decisions are required to be given on review only if it differs from the initial decision.[^110]

The difficulties in determining the ambit of the audi alteram partem, maxim and related rules and standards arises because of the infinite diversity of contexts of decisions coming on review before the Indian High Courts and the Supreme Court. These contexts include administrative adjudication on matters relating to (for example) labour, revenue (tax, customs, excise), trade (licensing, imports and exports, foreign exchange transactions, business, industry, banking, transport, acquisition and requisition of properly, agrarian reform, university litigation, and civil service under the state. Obviously, in such a heterogenous mix of matters different policy problems and issues arise. Judging each case or each type of situation on its particular context naturally provides the easier way out. Moreover, the increasing volume of administrative (and other) litigation coupled with highly fluctuating bench-structure (permitting little or no specialization in any particular field development and equally variable judicial tenures on the bench contribute to diverse judicial styles or extension of the principles of natural justice to different domains of administrative adjudication and administrative activity. Both the heterogeneity of the subject matters in administrative litigation and the institutional capacity of the judiciary to evolve and sustain coherent patterns of decision on basic issues of natural justice contribute to limit effective use of judicial power produce greater accountability in the exercise of administrative power.

[^97]: The court here reads first a right to hearing the Passport Act; it then converts this right into a right to a post-decisional hearing. Audi alteram partem rule was not to be readily eschewed, even though it may "suffer from situational modifications"; on the other hand, the "rule should not have the effect of paralyzing the administrative process or the need of promptitude or the urgency of the situation". A "remedial", but "genuine", post-decisional hearing was thus prescribed.
