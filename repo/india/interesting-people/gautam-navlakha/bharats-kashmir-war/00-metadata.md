[^/*]: This article owes a lot to far too many people
with whom I share common concerns and
dreams. But mention must be made of some.
Ishtiaq prompted my curiosity. Dipankar,
Sumanto and Tapan have patiently borne very
many of my confused and monologic exercises
and encouraged me most. Chou not only read
through the manuscript but helped with the
programming and along with others made the
most useful suggestions. Probir and Raghu provided
the nuance. And Venugopal was most
patient with my at times intolerable demands.
Through it all Ingrid helped set the deadline.
To all my very best thanks. However, the
responsibility for the arguments and their arranged
order, in all their shortcomings, remain
mine.
