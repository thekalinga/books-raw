The 11th Congress of the _CPI(M)_[^cpim] at
Vijayawada seems to have been spurred
by conditioned reflexes. The stimulus
is the US-Soviet rivalry in the international
arena. In response, the party
has decided to be guided by the traditional
unwritten premise which has
inspired Communist strategy in India
since the birth of the party in the
1920s, namely that defence of the
Soviet Union only can bring India
nearer a socialist revolution.

[^cpim]: Communist Party of India (Marxist).

Introducing the draft political resolution
at Vijayawada, B T Ranadive
warned that USA was directing "war
preparations against the Socialist World,
directly against the Soviet Union", and
said: "The danger has to be taken
seriously by our Party." He added:
"After the Congress, we will have to
devote far greater attention to the
peace movement."

The resolution itself, apart from
stressing the need for coming to the
defence of the Soviet Union, pays handsome
tributes to the USSR for "economic
help ... to many newly liberated
countries to steady their economies and
preserve their independence ... to
strengthen their defence capability
against imperialism and beat off the
attack of counter-revolution ..." The
assumption again appears to be the old
belief that extension of Soviet aid to
any ex-colony, irrespective of the
character of the latters ruling class,
could lead to its economic independence.

The _CPI(M)_'s attack on US military
preparations and its criticism of China's
pro-NATO policies are not wide of the
mark. But the party has failed to draw
the logical conclusion from the criticism.
It is behaving like a man raw all
down one side, but numb on the other.
While sensitive to US aggressive designs,
it remains unprovoked by the
series of Soviet or Soviet-backed aggressive
actions in recent years. The events
in Afghanistan, Kampuchea and Poland
are being looked at by the _CPI(M)_
through Russian eyes. It ignores the
fact that the nuclear weaponry system
is not the monopoly of the USA alone,
and its possession by the Soviet Union
also poses an equal threat to humanity.
It is significant that the "massive anti-war rallies"
of Bonn, Paris, Rome,
Brussels and Helsinki, to which the
_CPI(M)_ political resolution refers appreciatingly,
were directed against both
the superpowers.

While speaking of the danger of
war, the _CPI(M)_ makes out the Soviet
Union as a spotless victim of US conspiracy,
about to be devoured by
Reagan's war machine. It ought to
have remembered from past experience
that neither the Soviet Union nor the
USA is foolish enough to burn its
fingers in a direct confrontation with
each other. The pattern of conflict
between the two superpowers all these
years has followed the predictable
course of limited wars by proxy. Palace
coups or military take-overs, backed
by one or the other superpower to
maintain or extend its respective sphere
of influence, are the agreed forms from
which neither appears to be in a mood
to depart at the risk of a mutually
destructive nuclear conflagration. Given
this tacit understanding between themselves,
the Soviet Union does not need
the support of the _CPI(M)_, or any
other Communist Party for that matter,
to defend itself.

Clearly, the _CPI(M)_ is bending over
backwards to support the Soviet Union
on the plea of an impending US-Soviet
war. There is more to it than meets
the eye. Mao used to urge his followers
to "make a feint in the east, but attack
in the west" to create misconception
among the enemies. It seems that the
_CPI(M)_ leaders are adopting the same
tactics --- but to mislead its followers.

All the talk about a war and the
dangers faced by the Soviet Union is a
'feint' in the _CPI(M)_'s international
policy to draw attention away from the
long-promised, but never-conducted
'attack' against the Indian ruling
classes. This becomes clear when one
analyses both the political resolution
and the political-organisational report
placed before the Vijayawada conference.

Although the political resolution
warns against the "drive for dictatorship"
by the ruling party, and B T
Ranadive has promised to "acquire as
many allies as possible in the struggle
against the forces of authoritarianism",
both the resolution and Ranadive in
the same breath welcome the leader of
the authoritarian party, Indira Gandhi,
for her stand on Afghanistan and
Kampuchea. "On several issues of
foreign policy", the resolution says,
"the Indira Gandhi government takes
a correct stand in conformity with the
concept of non-alignment and opposition
to imperialism". Ranadive specified
the issues when he said: " ... the
Government of India takes welcome
stands on Pakistan, Kampuchea, Diego
Garcia and the Non-proliferation
Treaty ...". Thus, we are again being
fed with the moth-eaten thesis: while
the Indian rulers can be despotic at
home, in foreign policy their pro-socialist
and anti-imperialist line needs
to be supported. In the coming years,
when the political and economic situation
within India becomes critical, and
if --- as the _CPI(M)_ fears --- the international
situation hots up, how will
the _CPI(M)_ reconcile its two policies :
the domestic policy of fighting Indira
Gandhi's authoritarianism, and the international
policy of supporting her proSoviet
stand in the context of US-Soviet
conflict? Which of the two will gain
priority in the _CPI(M)_'s programme?

# BACK TO SQUARE ONE

It seems that the _CPI(M)_ is back to
square one of the Indian Communist
movement. In the post-Independence
era, the then undivided CPI was tom
between the national compulsion of
going the whole hog in its fight against
Nehru and the international faith that
consolidation of Soviet power and influence
(through aid to Nehru and in
exchange gaining Nehru's support in
international forums) could lead to the
spread of socialism (in India and other
parts of the Third World). Its support
to Nehru's foreign policy of 'non-alignment',
his seeking aid from the
Soviet Union for industrial development
and later, for defence, was prompted
by the belief that it would strengthen
the forces of socialism both within and
outside India, but in the process it
blunted the edge of the CPI's role as
a major opposition party, while the
Indian rulers managed to strengthen
the base of the capitalist forces. In fact,
those among the Indian communists
who held the view that the _bourgeoisie_
led by Nehru, despite the latter's pro-Soviet
stance, could not be an ally in
the struggle for the much-needed socioeconomic
transformation of the country,
and therefore had to be resisted wholeheartedly
on all fronts, came out and
formed the _CPI(M)_ in 1964. Ironically,
today, after 18 years, the leaders of
the same dissenters appear to be
seduced by the familiar incantation that
a nuclear war is inevitable between
the Soviet Union and the USA --- the
same bogey raised by Khrushchev in
the early 1960s in a bid to sidetrack
the national liberation movements by
creating the scare that limited wars
could lead to a nuclear war.

Is this a mechanical repetition of a
past mistake, or a deliberate attempt
to fight shy of the hard, but necessary
option of looking the domestic enemy
in the face? While painting the 'authoritarian'
enemy in dark colours, a patch
of pink here and there ("The government's
stand on Afghanistan ... is sober
and obstructs the US designs ... its
stand on Kampuchea and in support of
fighting Vietnam ... helps to frustrate
US designs") provides the enemy with
some saving grace, and consequently to
that extent disarms those who are expected
to fight authoritarianism tooth
and nail.

What is worse, the _CPI(M)_ at its
_Vijayawada session_ has picked upon
Pak militarisation as yet another excuse
to support Indira Gandhi. A special
resolution on Indo-Pak relations, passed
by the Congress, referring to Pak offer
of a no-war pact with India, says that
it cannot consider it as a proposal
"born out of any genuine desire for
maintaining peace in the sub-continent"
(echoing the same reaction expressed
earlier by Indira Gandhi). It then warns
the Indian people that "as long as the
military regime of Pakistan plays the
US imperialist game, there cannot be
any peace or stability in the sub-continent".
It calls on all "patriotic forces"
to educate the people on the "gravity
of the situation and rally them to foil
the conspiracy that the US imperialists
have hatched against our country in
collusion with Pakistani military regime",
adding at the end: "This is
not a task that can be left to the
government alone". If translated into
action, this would mean a 'Hate Pakistan'
campaign with all the accompanying
danger of a communal holocaust
--- as had happened so often in the past,
a historical fact of which the _CPI(M)_
should not be unaware. In the political
resolution, the Congress lends support
to Indira Gandhi's efforts to whip up
a war psychosis by adding: "Its \[the
government's\] anxiety about the defence
of the country is justified in view of
the US machinations in the neighbouring
countries." The phrases are reminiscent
of the jingoism indulged in
by conservative forces in the past,
whenever Indo-Pak relations touched a
low ebb. Strangely enough, in those
days it was the communists who
warned against such jingoism and war
hysteria. The mantle of great nation
chauvinism has fallen today on the
shoulders of the _CPI(M)_!

The conservatism is not confined only
to Indo-Pak relations. Aspirations of
the tribal minorities who are breaking
out from the influence of the established
political parties (who all these
years had ignored their interests) and
launching independent struggles of their
own, are looked down upon as "divisive
forces" and "machinations of ... foreign
Christian missions" (_Draft Political
Resolution_). Phrases like "dismemberment
of the country" occur frequently,
reminding us again of the old _Jana
Sangh_-type vituperation against tribal
struggles.

# DOWNWARD SPIRAL

The downward spiral of retreat from
revolutionary phrase-mongering to conservative
behaviour was perhaps inevitable
in the history of the _CPI(M)_.
Winning elections with socialist phrases
on its lips, and then proceeding to administer
a semi-feudal and semi-capitalist
society --- which it previously denounced ---
in as efficient a way as possible,
marked the doom of the party's
politics. But the need to sustain the
radical expectations of the ranks remains,
and the facade of militant anti-authoritarianism
and anti-imperialism
has to be knocked together now and
then, even at the risk of sounding
blatantly hypocritical. Otherwise, how
can one explain the _CPI(M)_'s decision
at its 10th Congress at Jullurdur in
1978 to pit "the full strength of
democratic resistance ... against the
authoritarian forces", and yet later its
role in toppling the _Janata government_
in 1979 by lending support to the
rump led by Charan Singh, knowing
fully well that the latter was being
backed by Indira Gandhi? Negotiations
going on between Sanjay Gandhi and
Charan Singh's emissary Raj Narayan
were too obvious to have escaped the
notice of the _CPI(M)_ leaders. Incidentally,
criticism of this action of the
central leadership was voiced at the
_Vijayawada Congress_ by delegates from
West Bengal, who even in 1979 were
opposed to the party's decision to support
the no-confidence motion against
the _Janata government_. The _Vijayawada
Congress_ however did not acknowledge
its 1979 role as a mistake. The
party's general secretary E MS Namboodiripad,
presenting the political-organisational
report at the Congress,
referred to the 1979 crisis and said
that by April that year the _CPI(M)_
leaders had come to the conclusion that
"the _Janata Party_ was not stable and
that it was necessary to work for a new
alignment of forces". Curiously enough,
the new forces represented the pro-Soviet
elements in the _Janata Party_ ---
Madhu Limaye and Charan Singh ---
who along with three important _CPI(M)_
leaders --- also known for their strong
pro-Soviet leanings --- masterminded
the toppling of the _Janata government_,
and paved the way for the return of
the "authoritarian forces against which
the _CPI(M)_ fulminated at the _Jullundur
Congress_, and is now again repeating
the same charges of 'dictatorial
rule'. Is the _CPI(M)_ suffering from a
schizophrenic frame of mind ---
pathetic lack of connection between
past pledges and current actions?

# RADICAL PROMISES AND CONSERVATIVE ACTION

Contradictions crop up not only between
past decisions and present
actions, but also between simultaneous
radical promises and conservative behaviour.
The _Vijayawada Congress_, for
instance, reiterated in its political resolution
the directive of the _Jullundur
Congress_ : "It is the duty of the party
to ... thwart the machinations of the
multinationals and the World Bank and
defeat the policies which enable them
to penetrate our economy." Yet, it is
well known now that at the same time
the _CPI(M)_-dominated _Left Front_
government of West Bengal was
approaching a multinational --- Britannia
Biscuits --- to take over the management
of a 92-year-old indigenous firm,
Lily Biscuits. In fact, soon after forming
the government, the West Bengal
chief minister Jyoti Basu (who was,
and still remains a member of the
party's _politburo_) addressed a meeting
of industrialists and businessmen in
Calcutta inviting multinationals to
invest and expand in his state. "They
are there" --- he said referring to the
multinationals --- "we cannot wish them
away". Therefore, they might as well
invest here --- "we shall provide any
help that may be necessary." (_Economic
Times_, August 20, 1977). A perfectly
sensible statement --- by one who has
agreed to work within the established
constitutional system, accepting the
_bourgeois state_, its institutions, its
civil service, its industrial policies, etc.
For such a participant in the existing
ruling system, it is difficult also to
reject the World Bank which is contributing
generously to numerous development
projects in Calcutta. But for
the _CPI(M)_ leadership to admit this
publicly is still rather difficult, because
it would confirm that they have now
abandoned completely their aim of
overthrowing the prevailing system. So,
they waffle about the need to fight
multinationals and the World Bank,
which will guarantee the continued
confidence of the ranks in their image
of anti-imperialism.

The widening gulf between rhetoric
and practice is also evident in the
_CPI(M)_'s role in the civil liberties
movement in the country. Although the
_Vijayawada Congress_ resolution speaks
of the government's attempts to crush
democratic movements by enactment of
repressive laws, nowhere in the entire
political resolution is there any reference
to the various civil liberties
groups who in different parts of India
are carrying out a relentless struggle to
bring to the notice of the public ---
either through press, or by conducting
cases in the courts --- the repression
on various sections of the people: tribal
peasants, prisoners in jails, _Naxalites_,
women, _Harijans_. The omission is
significant. The _CPI(M)_ has not officially
joined any of these civil liberties
groups. This writer has had personal
experience of trying to persuade _CPI(M)_
leaders since 1977 to co-operate with
fledgling civil liberties group operating
in Delhi then. But the party leaders
either raised procedural questions, demanding
representation in the group
on the basis of the numerical strength
of their followers, instead of the actual
work done by their members, or dismissed
the group '_Naxalite-infested_'
organisation. Repeated requests
for participation in fact-finding teams
to investigate into cases of violation of
democratic rights --- both during the
_Janata_ and the later _Congress(I)_[^congressi] regimes
--- met with sullen refusals from the
_CPI(M)_ leaders. The reasons are understandable.
These civil liberties groups
protests against repression by the state
machinery, irrespective of the political
hue of its administrators. The _CPI(M)_
as a ruling party in Kerala, has used
the state's repressive machinery to
imprison dissident writers. Having
agreed to work within the framework
of the existing constitution and legal
system, it depends on the conventional
repressive apparatus to stifle dissent,
behaving in the same way as the
_Congress(I)_ or the _Janata_, or any other
political party, thus inviting the criticism
of those actively concerned over
civil liberties and democratic rights.
Thus, while trying to denounce Indira
Gandhi's "anti-democratic" behaviour
the _CPI(M)_ is probably at the same
time guilty --- on a minor scale certainly ---of the same crime.

# PRAGMATIC CONSIDERATIONS

Residues of past radical gestures are
fast being swept away by pragmatic
considerations like the need to maintain
the _Left Front_ governments in West
Bengal and Tripura, winning over the
benevolent neutrality of a section of
industrialists, avoiding a direct clash
with Indira Gandhi which might unleash
repression on its ranks who have
not been prepared by the leaders for
resistance, a desire to emerge as a
'patriotic' national party by playing
on the traditional fear of Indians of
a Pakistani aggression. Given these
compulsions, the pledge to fight Indira
Gandhi's authoritarianism in the _Vijayawada
resolution_ is doomed to the same
fate that overtook the _Jullundur Congress_
resolution. The _CPI(M)_ now wants
to find increasing areas of agreement --- and
later co-operation --- with Indira
Gandhi, by developing proximity to the
Soviet Union. It is refurbishing the
image of the Soviet Communist Party.
A few years ago --- during its phase of
'equi-distance' --- the _CPI(M)_ had
found Soviet 'revisionism' and Chinese
'dogmatism' as the twin dangers to
the Communist movement. At Vijayawada,
the Soviet Union has emerged
as the saviour --- defending Afghanistan
from "US designs to enslave it" and
protecting India through the Indo-Soviet
Treaty against Pakistani aggression!

In the absence of a viable Left alternative,
myths and illusions, lingering
hopes and expectations, readiness to give
the benefit of doubt and wishful thinking,
form an interesting and often an
extraordinary part of the political behaviour
of many among the ranks and
followers who have flocked to the
_CPI(M)_. Not without any reason, EMS
Namboodiripad claimed at the _Vijayawada
Congress_ that at a time when all
_bourgeois opposition_ parties had collapsed
and even the ruling _Congress(I)_
was faction-ridden and in crisis, the
_CPI(M)_ had emerged as the major
Left Opposition party. Namboodiripad
added that in bringing about the change,
the _Left Front_ governments of West
Bengal and Tripura and the erstwhile
_Left-Democratic Front Government_ of
Kerala had played a 'very significant
role'. This observation is interesting.
It will be seen that of the party's total
membership of about 270,000, 68 per
cent come from West Bengal and
Kerala. The increase in the membership
from 161,400 in 1978, had taken place
since the party's coming to office in the
three states. The party leaders should
compare the rate of increase that had
taken place in the previous years with
that in the last four years, and ponder
over the question whether the recent
increase has anything to do with the
general tendency of a party in office
attracting followers, Reports from West
Bengal about rich peasants who were
Once with the _Congress(I)_ overnight
shifting their loyalty to the _CPI(M)_
after the 1977 elections, and capturing
the _panchayats_ to frustrate land reforms,
are disturbing.

But it is not surely the fascination
with power that merely leads people
in certain parts of the country to look
up to the _CPI(M)_ as a major Left
party. In the countryside of Kerala and
West Bengal, a few concrete measures
which might have benefited a few, but
have roused hopes among many --- like
Operation Barga, seeking to ensure
rights for sharecroppers in West Bengal
--- are sufficient to attenuate more
critical views against the _CPI(M)_, and
muffle allegations about the growing
corruption among party MLAs and
_panchayat_ heads.

Besides, the scope for criticism within
the _CPI(M)_ organisation is severely
limited. Run on strictly Stalinist lines,
the party hardly allows the minority to
mobilise members around any alternative
view. Orders, decisions and
everything else flow from above. This
has helped the _CPI(M)_ to remain monolithic.
A typical instance is EMS
Namboodiripad's imprecation against
the minority at the _Vijayawada Congress_.
Referring to the minority's opposition
to the party's decision to
topple the _Janata government_ in 1979,
Nambodiripad disapproved of the
"method of raising such differences in
State conferences" (the insinuation was
against the _West Bengal State conference_
of the _CPI(M)_ held on the eve of
the _Vijayawada Congress_, where the
party's 1979 decision was criticised),
and warned that the new central committee
would evolve a procedure to
resolve such differences within the
party.

Because of these various factors ---
the origins of the _CPI(M)_ as a militant
communist party fighting against revisionism,
which still sustains a large
number of dedicated cadres; its vocabulary
of anti-authoritarianism and pro-Soviet
sentiments which help create
the image of a Leftist opposition among
Indians who are against Indira Gandhi
and still nurture hopes about the soviet
Union's sympathies with the toiling
people of India; its success in winning
elections in West Bengal and maintaining
power there through a few reformist
and populist measures; and its ability
to impose discipline over its ranks ---
the _CPI(M)_ remains the principal
organised force of the parliamentary
Left in India. For the Indian ruling
classes, particularly the industrialists,
its virtue lies in the fact that in states
where it had come to office, it had been
able to confine popular discontent to
electoral channels and keep the class
struggle within noms permitted by the
present system. The _CPI(M)_'s ability
to keep its apple cart rolling will of
course depend on the course of events,
on the pressure from its ranks and on
the balance of social forces.

But that the _CPI(M)_, however limited
its influence might be in the all-India
context, is considered important both
by the rulers and the ruled in some
parts of the country, is a fact that is
ignored by many among those who are
far to the left of the _CPI(M)_ --- the
different Marxist-Leninist groups
well as the non-party voluntary organisations
working in the countryside. They
tend to underestimate the _CPI(M)_'s
influence not only on the large sections
of the middle class in West Bengal
and Kerala, but also on the organised
industrial proletariat and peasantry in
different parts of the country through
its mass fronts, which rally them around
immediate economic benefits that would
mollify them, and immunise them
against more exacting alternative programmes
of social change. It would be
wrong for any revolutionary group to
think of a radical transformation of
Indian society without trying to win
the support of these broad masses who
are still swayed by the _CPI(M)_ and
similar influential parliamentary parties.
