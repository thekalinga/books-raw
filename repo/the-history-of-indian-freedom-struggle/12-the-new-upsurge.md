# THE NEW UPSURGE

## ON THE PATH OF STRUGGLE AGAIN

The decision taken at the Madras session of the Congress
to _boycott_ the _Simon Commission_ led to the emergence
of a new country-wide _anti-imperialist_ movement. As it
happened during the visit of the Prince of Wales, massive
protest demonstrations were held throughout the country,
ending the stagnation that had set in the Indian politics for
about five years. The freedom fighting organizations including
the Congress, once again took the path of struggle.

There was a basic difference between the visit of the
Prince of Wales and that of the _Simon Commission_. The
'moderates' had kept themselves away from the _boycott_ of
the visit of the Prince. They had even participated in many
of the functions arranged in connection with it. Now a big
change had come about in 'moderate' politicians. Like the
_Congressmen_, they too now became indignant at the announcement
in relation to the terms of reference, powers,
structure and appointment of the _Simon Commission_.
Presiding over the Annual Conference of the _Liberal Federation_,
Tej Bahadur Sapru said:

>I do not think a worse challenge had been thrown out even
before to Indian nationalism, and notwithstanding the
profuse assurance in Mr. Baldwin's speech and the yet
more profuse assurances in Mr. Ramsay MacDonald's
speech, Indian nationalism of the 'Moderate' school have
been compelled to ask if the only way of recognizing the
spirit of cooperation is by telling Indians that their lot is
to be none other than of petitioners, that they can not be
trusted to participate in the responsibility of making recommendations
to Parliament for the future of their country,
and that all that they may aspire to is to put their
proposals before the Commission which may accept them
or reject them, and again to repeat the same process of
persuasion, argument and discussion before the Joint
Committee of Parliament. And now if this is what is
meant by co-operation, if this is the new idea of equality
of status on which we are to be fed, if our patriotism
is a prejudice and if the patriotism of the seven Members
of Parliament is to be treated as impartial justice, then
we Liberals feel justified in telling the Government here
and in England, "you may do anything you like in the
assertion of your right as supreme power, but we are not
going to acquiesce in this method of dealing with us. Neither
our self-respect not our sense of duty to our country
can permit us to go near the Commission.[^12/1]

[^12/1]: Quoted in R. C. Majumdar (cd), _The History and Culture of the Indian
People_, Vol XI. Bombay, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1969, p. 456.

Besides, the _Liberal Federation_ of Sapru, there were
many political groups outside the Congress which took the
same stand. In the Central legislature the resolution moved
by Lajpat Rai opposing the proposal to constitute a committee
to cooperate with the _Simon Commission_, received the
support of a majority of the elected members. When the
resolution was declared passed, the House resounded with
shouts of "_Vande Mataram_". This was a clear evidence to
the clash that was going on between the nationalist opposition
and the official side.

Not only in the _boycott_ of the _Simon Commission_, but
also in the efforts to formulate a reforms proposal of the
Indians as opposed to the proposal being prepared by the
Commission, the different 'moderate' groups cooperated with
the Congress. Following the discussions held in February
and March 1928, an _all-parties conference_ was convened,
which was participated by the representative of the different
parties. After protracted discussions the conference decided
to appoint an _all-parties committee_ with the task of deciding
the form and content of the future administrative set up and
also a generally acceptable formula with regard to the representation
of the different communities in the administration
and legislature. Since the Congress was the predominant
party both in the conference and the committee, the Congress
President Dr. Ansari was the chairman of the conference
and the leader of the _Congress Parliamentary Party_ and the
eminent lawyer, Motilal Nehru, the chairman of the committee.
Thus, all the _bourgeois_ political parties came together
under the leadership of the Congress to draft a reform
proposal as opposed to that of the _Simon Commission_.

But, none of the organizations of the 'moderates' cared to
participate in organizing the mass protest action as decided
by the Madras session of the Congress. The main political
organization that stood in the forefront was the Congress.
The leftist organizations working inside and outside the
Congress, youth and trade union organizations which had
slowly begun to enter the political field, played a vital role
in making the _boycott_ a success. The leftist section in the
Congress which stood for _complete independence_, made invaluable
contributions to the success of the protest programme.
Similarly, the right-wing _Congressmen_ who were striving to
lead the Congress along the path of negotiation to win
_Dominion Status_ also played their role for the success of the
_boycott_ programme.


On the arrival of the _Simon Commission_ in Bombay on 3rd February 1928, the people all over India observed _hartal_.
Renewing the memory of the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_ days,
shops were closed, students boycotted classes and workers
went on strike. There were firings and _lathi-charges_ in a
number of places like Madras, Calcutta, Lahore, Allahabad
and Lucknow. Lala Lajpat Rai, Jawaharlal Nehru, Govind
Ballabh Pant and other leaders and volunteers were subjected
to severe repression. Lajpat Rai died soon after and his
death was attributed to the injuries he received in the police
beating on that day. The repression aroused great indignation
throughout the country.

Although the organization of the 'moderates' to whom
mass agitation and struggle were an anathema, in general
kept themselves away form the movement, they participated
in the boycott programme at least in the form of not
taking part in the committees formed to cooperate with the
_Simon Commission_. The _Justice Party_ of Madras, the
factions of the _Muslim League_ cooperating with the government,
the landlord's organization and the Depressed Castes
organization led by BR Ambedkar were however exceptions.

Unlike in the 1921--22 period, the Congress was able to
organize the _boycott_ with the participation of the 'moderate'
sections, at least in a limited way. This was the result of
the changes in the attitude of both the Congress and
'moderates'. This change represented the transformation the
_bourgeoisie_ as a class had undergone.

The _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_ movement was launched
at a time when the question arose before the _bourgeoisie_
whether the path of negotiations or the path of confrontation
was more effective. Gandhi and the leaders of the _Khilafat_
were the advocates of one path while the different 'moderates'
groups represented the other. The clash between the two
groups found reflected on a number of issues like the visit
of the Prince of Wales. With the withdrawal of the _Civil
Disobedience_ following the _Chauri Chaura_ incident, this
chapter in the Indian politics came to a close. The 'moderate'
sections became convinced that the Gandhian path of struggle
was not as "dangerous" as they had thought of it at the time
of the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_ movement. The performance
of leaders like CR Das and Motilal Nehru in the legislature
as _Swarajists_ and later on as _Congressmen_ created good
impressions among the 'moderates' about the Congress.

The way in which the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_ movement
ended led to a serious rethinking in the Congress
leadership. They were convinced that the activities both
inside and outside the legislature would help them to keep
the people prepared to use the ultimate weapon of _non-cooperation_
and _civil disobedience_. Since the 'moderates' could
make valuable contributions to this, they realized the need to
maintain close link between the two. This led Gandhi,
Motilal Nehru and other Congress leaders to take the attitude
of cooperation with the 'moderates' in the _boycott_ of the _Simon
Commission_ and in the appointment of the _All-Parties
Committee_ to examine the constitutional questions.

While engaged in the discussion on constitution through
the medium of the _All-Parties Committee_ in cooperation with
the 'moderates', the Congress leadership had also sought the
cooperation of Communists, Socialists and other leftists. A
step in this direction was the resolution passed at the Madras
session of the Congress adopting the goal of _Full Independence_.

At the same time, the Congress leadership also maintained
relations with _anti-imperialist_ organizations (it formally
became a member of the _Anti-imperialist League_) and condemned
the attacks of the imperialist forces against the
revolutionary forces in China at the international level, while
at the national level encouraged the efforts of the workers
and peasants organizations to play active roles in Indian
politics. They were convinced of the fact it was impossible
to face the challenge of imperialism without the active cooperation
of all the forces within and outside the Congress
determined to fight imperialist domination.

The 'moderates' outside the Congress were however not
convinced of this. They were satisfied that the Congress
leadership had adopted a programme of action --- discussion
on the constitution in the _All-Parties Committee_ --- which was
immediately acceptable to them. This was basic to the
understanding reached between the 'moderates' and the
Congress with regard to the _boycott_ of the _Simon Commission_
and the attempt to draft a constitution through the
_All-Parties Committee_.

But the Congress leadership and Gandhi in particular
did not stop with this. They were aware of the inevitability
of a confrontation with the imperialism. As a preparation
for such a confrontation, they wanted to continue to cooperate
with the 'moderate' sections, placate the left and revolutionary
sections and consolidate the organization for the
national struggle through Gandhian _constructive programmes_.
Along with these, there was also a need to gain strength and
capability at least in some places to organize this inevitable
confrontation in the Gandhian method. The beginning of
such an effort was also going on along with the _boycott_ of
the _Simon Commission_ and the activities of the _All-Parties
Committee_.

Here we are referring to the _Satyagraha_ under the Gandhian
leadership launched against the enhancement of land
revenue in the Bardoli _taluk_ of Gujarat in the early months
of 1928. This gained all-India fame just as the _boycott_
of the _Simon Commission_. It may be recalled that the mass
struggle of 1921--22 was called off in the Bardoli _taluk_.
Conducting a mass struggle at the same place, based on the
single issue of tax increase though, was considered a pointer
to the future. In that sense, the Bardoli struggle was as
important as the _boycott_ of the _Simon Commission_ and the
work of the _All-Parties Committee_.

As in other _Ryotwari_ areas, the government had decided
to revise the land tax. The result of the revision was a 20
to 25 percent increase in taxes, which quite naturally led to
powerful protests. Although the peasants expressed their
feelings through petitions and in other forms, the government
did not budge. The peasants became convinced that some
serious step was necessary to make the government revoke
the increase and approached Vallabhbhai Patel, a disciple of
Gandhi in Gujarat. With the blessings of a large number of
Congress leaders, including Gandhi and Vithalbhai Patel (his
brother), Vallabhbhai took up the leadership of the struggle.

It must be noted that the Bardoli struggle was not
launched for the solution of the general problems of the
peasant masses as a whole, as was made out by the _bourgeois_
media. Payment of rent to the landlord, interest and the
repayment of debt to the money-lender, and tax to the
government constituted the three burdens of the peasantry.
The common objective of the peasantry was the liberation
from all the three.

The Bardoli struggle was directed against only one of
these, _viz._, the increased land tax. In the forefront of the
Bardoli struggle were those who would turn against the
struggle the moment it turned against the landlords and
money-lenders. Likewise, the top Congress leaders including
Vallabhbhai Patel (who earned the title of "Sardar" as the
leader of the struggle) led the struggle in such a way as to
protect the interests of the rich peasants.

However, the Bardoli struggle helped to unite and rally
the entire peasantry of the Bardoli _taluk_ under the Gandhian
leadership. The peasants carried out the call by Gandhi
and Patel not to pay the increased tax. When the government
took action to attach and auction the land and other
properties of the peasants who did not pay the tax, the people
boycotted the auction. Arrests and other repressive actions
did not deter them. Finally, the government had to come to
a settlement cancelling in effect the increase in the tax.

The political gain made by the national independence
movement as a whole through the struggle was more significant
than the economic gain made by the peasantry. For
it demonstrated the fact that the Bardoli peasants were able
to defeat the government through the resistance for a few
weeks. The people became confident that if a struggle
confined to a _taluk_ could be so successful, a struggle based on
other issues including _full independence_ could be won by the
same means. The lack of confidence that had grown in the
Gandhian leadership following 1922 was to a great measure
removed. And the belief spread that another national
struggle could now be organized with Gandhi as its "commander-in-chief".

## THE BREAK-OFF AND THE SETTLEMENT

The Congress decided to convene the _All-Parties
Conference_ and to form the _All-Parties Committee_ as a
reply to the British challenge thrown at the nationalists to
draft a constitution acceptable to all sections of Indians.
And for the same reason, representatives of the different parties
and organizations such as the liberals led by Tej Bahadur
Sapru, the followers of Tilak having leanings towards the
_Hindu Mahasabha_, Muslim political leaders led by Jinnah,
the Depressed Castes led by B.R Ambedkar, the _Justice
Party_ of South India, and so on participated in the Conference
and the Committee.

An inevitable consequence of drawing together these
disparate elements would have been a deviation of the
Congress from its declared objective of _full independence_,
because most of them were standing for _Dominion Status_
and not for _full independence_. The Congress, on the other
hand, not only adopted _full independence_ as its objective at
its Madras session, but also had adopted certain _anti-imperialist_
resolutions and appointed Jawaharlal Nehru as one
of the General Secretaries who were supposed to implement
these resolutions.

This was a paradox. Later Nehru himself had written
in his _autobiography_ that the suspension that the same
leadership which had adopted the resolutions moved by him
on behalf of the leftist _Congressmen_ and nominated him
as one of the General Secretaries was preventing the implementation
of these resolutions had been disturbing him.

In the circumstances, Jawaharlal Nehru and his colleagues
decided to form a new leftist Congress organization
called the _Independence for India League_. The _League_
relentlessly tried to warn the people against the toning down
of the _Full Independence_ resolution adopted at Madras and
to rally behind it the ordinary _Congressmen_, particularly the
youth. The left wing _Congressmen_, including Jawaharlal
Nehru and Subhas Bose, engaged themselves actively in
organizing provincial and district conferences and _youth
melas_ at which the issue of _Dominion Status_ v. _Full Independence_
was debated. (One such provincial conference held at
Payyannur, Kerala, which was presided over by Nehru was
the first experience of the present author in political debate.)
The Congress split into two camps: one section championed
the cause of _full independence_ and the other reduced it to an
idol for worship.

There were advocates of _full independence_ in the _AllParties
Conference_ and Committee. Their leader, Jawaharlal
Nehru, himself actively participated in the _All-Parties
Committee_. But they knew that they were only a minority
in the Conference and the Committee. Besides, a galaxy of
_Talukdars_ and other recipients of decorations and titles
from the British for loyalty and friendship had filled the
dais of the Conference. Jawaharlal Nehru, angered at this
strange sight blurted out: "Many on the dais are socially
unwanted". This created quite a stir in the conference which
later passed a resolution suited to pacify the feelings of the
title-holders.

This was only a beginning. It was in fact a prelude to
the continuous clash that was going to take place between
the advocates of _full independence_ and those who stood for
_Dominion Status_ in the _All-Parties Conference_ on the working
of the _All-Parties Committee_ and over the steps to be taken
following the submission of the Committee's report.

This was, however, only one side of the picture. The
communal organizations and parties, including the _Muslim
League_, were ranged in one camp, while the Congress and
the _Liberal Federation_ in another, with their characteristic
differences and disputes. Nehru has recorded that it was with
the hope of at least solving these questions that the advocates
of _full independence_ took part in the deliberations. But, it was
mainly on this question that the All-Parties discussions
failed.

There were three aspects of the question relating to the
future administrative set-up: (1) the relations between India
and Britain, (2) the share of the different religious and caste
communities in the new set-up and (3) relations between the
Centre and the provinces.

The _All-Parties Committee_ and the Congress leadership
were able to arrive at a temporary settlement on the first
issue. On the second and third issues, no settlement could
be arrived at and the representatives of the various caste-communal
organizations walked out of the meeting, ending
the year-long All-Parties discussions in failure.

The constitution drafted by the Committee, known as
the _Nehru Report_ did not envisage even _Dominion Status_,
leave alone _full independence_.

The Report proposed that in matters relating to defence,
the defence minister of future India should function in
accordance with the recommendations of a committee in
which the army commanders would have a majority. The
advocates of _full independence_ naturally felt disturbed at
the scheme giving predominance to the officials in a department
of vital importance. They feared that it constituted a
departure from the Madras resolution.

The opposition of the different religious-caste parties
and organizations, including the _Muslim League_, to the _Nehru
Report_ was much more intense. Here it will be useful to
compare the _Nehru Report_ with the proposals put forward
by Jinnah on behalf of the Muslim community.

1. Both agreed on the point that the relationship
   between the Centre and the provinces should be federal
   in character. They also agreed that the powers of the
   Centre and the provinces should be strictly defined. But,
   however strict the definition, there would still remain some
   subjects which would come neither under the Centre nor
   the provinces. The Report proposed that the "residuary
   powers" on such subjects should be vested in the Centre.
   Hindu organizations like the _Hindu Mahasabha_ and political
   parties like the _Liberal Federation_ supported this. . The
   _League_ maintained that the residuary powers should be vested
   in the provinces.
2. In the election to the Central and provincial legislatures,
   the Report proposed reservation for Muslims in
   Hindu majority provinces and for non-Muslims in NWFP
   and other Muslim majority provinces with representation
   in proportion to the population of the particular communities.
   The _Muslim League_ demanded one-third representation
   in the Central legislature for Muslims and seats
   reservation in proportion to the population in the Muslim
   majority provinces of Punjab and Bengal.
3. The Nehru Committee recommended that all
   communities should have equal voting rights in the election
   to reserved seats. Jinnah, who was the representative of
   the _Muslim League_, did not demand at that stage separate
   constituencies with voting right exclusively for the Muslims.
   But other Muslim leaders who had broken away from Jinnah
   did raise the issue. Later, Jinnah too adopted this position.
   This was an important subject which came up during the
   subsequent discussions on the Hindu-Muslim problems.

In the face of opposition on these issues which the
Committee refused to concede, Jinnah walked out of the
Committee and joined hands with the Aga Khan and other
Muslim leaders who had already left the _League_ earlier to
demand more on behalf of the Muslims in an aggressive way.

Following Jinnah's walk out, the representatives of the
Sikhs, _non-Brahmins_, Depressed Castes, and the Christians
also kept away from the deliberations of the _All-Parties
Committee_ leaving the Congress, the _Liberal Federation_ and
certain Hindu organizations including the _Hindu Mahasabha_
in the Committee. In the circumstances, the leaders who remained
in the Committee decided to wind up the Committee.

Although the _All-Parties Conference_ and Committee were
thus dissolved, the report of the Committee had become a
public document. The problem came up before the Congress
as to what should be its attitude towards the Committee's
report. The specific question was whether it should accept
the scheme contained in the report which fell short of
even the _Dominion Status_ or it should remain firm on the objective
of _full independence_ rejecting the _Nehru Report_.

This problem had, in fact, come up even before the
Committee's report was adopted by the _All-Parties Conference_.
Jawaharlal Nehru said that people like him who
stood for _full independence_ were in a quandary. If the
report would help to solve the _communal question_, they
would not stand in its path, but they could not compromise
on the objective of _full independence_. Accordingly, after
consulting his colleagues, Jawaharlal Nehru made a statement
in the Conference to the effect that while they did not agree
with the degrading of _full independence_, they did not want
to stand in the way of communal unity.

It may be noted that this statement was made while
Jinnah was still participating in the All-Parties discussions.

Later when the Calcutta session of the Congress was
held in December 1928 with Motilal Nehru, the chief architect
of the _Nehru Report_, in chair, the father and the son
were found themselves in the opposite camps. Jawaharlal
Nehru has mentioned in passing in his _Autobiography_ the
consequent mental agony he had been undergoing.

It is hardly a question of tension between a father and a
son, but a question of tension that existed between one
another among all from top to bottom in the Congress. Neither
side was willing to yield its position. However, both
were equally convinced that a split as it took place first in
Surat and again in Gaya would be disastrous to the
Congress.

It was at this juncture that Gandhi returned to the
active leadership of the Congress. Gandhi had not been
participating in the activities of the Congress since his arrest
in 1922, except on occasions like bringing about rapprochement
between the Congress and the _Swaraj Party_. In the
background in which some parties including the _League_ had
broken away and doubts persisted if the advocates of _full
independence_ would likewise leave the Congress, pressures
were brought on Gandhi to be present at the Calcutta session
in order to maintain the unity in the Congress. As an experienced
_bourgeois_ politician, Gandhi himself was convinced of
the need for it. Accordingly, Gandhi attended the Calcutta
session and after holding discussion with both the camps, he
brought out a compromise solution in the form of a resolution
which stated:

>Congress will adopt the constitution in its
entirety... as a great step in political advance, especially as it
represents the largest measure of agreement attained among
the important parties in the country... if it is accepted by the
British Parliament on or before December 31st, 1929, hut
in the event of its non-acceptance by that date or its earlier
rejection, Congress will organise a _non-violent_ non-cooperation
by advising the country to refuse taxation and
such other manner as is settled.

This compromise was not acceptable to Jawaharlal Nehru,
Subhas Bose and other leftwing _Congressmen_. On behalf
of the left, Bose moved an amendment to Gandhi's resolution,
standing firm on the objective of _full independence_. It was,
however, lost with 973 voting for and 1350 voting against it.

That the section of the Congress led by Gandhi and
Motilal Nehru had only a small majority as shown by the
voting was an indication of the growing strength of the left
in the Congress.

Although the left wing Congressmen led by Jawaharlal
Nehru and Subhas Bose brought an amendment to the resolution
introduced by Gandhi they did not intend to go against the
majority of the Calcutta session. They were prepared to wait
as specified in the resolution. They decided to go ahead with
the preparation for the imminent _direct action_. In that sense
it can be unhesitatingly stated that the Calcutta session was
a compromise between the advocates of _full independence_
and those of the _Dominion Status_.

But, a highly significant incident took place at the
Calcutta session. It was the march of fifty thousand workers
into the venue of the session. This was a clear indication to the
fact that the working class had risen as an organized political
force and that they had begun to enter the pla:form of the
_bourgeois_ politics led by Gandhi, Motilal Nehru and others.
The celebrated poet of Kerala, Vallathol Narayana Menon,
who was an observer in the Congress session had warranted
this incident in one of his poems.) It was a prelude to the
strengthening of the _anti-imperialist_ struggle with Jawaharlal
Nehru and others fighting inside the Congress and the
organized working class outside it.

## MAIN POLITICAL FORCES IN THE WORKING CLASS MOVEMENT

The mammoth march of workers into the venue of the
Calcutta session was not an isolated incident. It was a high
level demonstration of the workers' movement which had
been growing systematically over the past few years as well
as of the political consciousness that had begun to emerge
within that movement.

Earlier, we had described in some details the friendship
and cooperation between the _anti-imperialist_ national leaders
and the workers and other labouring masses that had begun
to grow since the emergence of the 'extremist' political movement
under the leadership of Tilak. The political condition
that existed during the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_ movements
helped to strengthen this process.

But as distinct from the earlier days when it was an
appendage of the Congress and other nationalist organizations,
now the working class had acquired the necessary
organizational consciousness to organize the primary form
of its own class organization --- the trade union --- and to form
an all-India organization, the _All-India Trade Union Congress_
(_AITUC_) to coordinate the various trade unions.
That is, in place of conducting demonstrations and struggles
as an appendage of the _bourgeoisie_ which is basically an
enemy class, the workers have transformed themselves into a
class fighting for their own demand under their own class
organization.

This is borne out by the strike struggles waged by the
workers during the seven years following 1921, the peak
period of the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_ movement.

These strikes were not conducted under the leadership
of any political party. They were conducted by their own
organizations, the trade unions, working above political parties,
although workers of many political parties had rendered
them assistance. Although much after the emergence of the
political party of the _bourgeoisie_, the Congress, and the
non-political organizations of the same class like _Merchants'
chambers_, etc., the working class had started to wage struggles
in defence of their own demands under the leadership
of the all-India organization of their own.

The accounts of the strikes given above point to an
important fact. Though the trade union organizations were
organizationally above party politics, the strike struggles
conducted under their leadership were inseparably linked
with the _anti-imperialist_ struggles waged under the leadership
of the _bourgeoisie_. Thus, the number of strikes reached the
highest in 1921, the peak period of the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_
movement, which went down regularly thereafter. It
shows that the stagnation set in Indian politics and the disappointment
of the political activists cooled off the fighting
spirit of the working class.

The number of workers participated in the strikes and
the number of man-days lost also show another feature. It
can be seen that the number of strikes, the number of workers
participating in them as well as the number of man-days
lost decreased in 1922, the year in which the _non-cooperation_
and _civil disobedience_ were called off. In 1923, the
number of man-power lost increased in spite of a decrease
in the number of strikes as well as the number of workers
participating in the strikes. In 1924, though the number of
strikes came down to a third of that of 1921, the number
of man-power lost in 1925 was almost twice that of 1921,
although the number of strikes remained almost the same
as in 1924. It shows that the workers' capacity increased
year by year to fight determinedly, to stand firm on prolonged
strikes facing all kinds on obstructions.

The statistics pertaining to 1926 and 1927 provide direct
evidence to show that the stagnation and despondency that
afflicted politics had considerably affected the militancy of
the working class. The number of strikes, the workers participating
in them and the man-days lost were all at their
lowest during this period. But the number of man-days lost
in 1927 was almost twice that of 1926, indicating the beginning
of a new upsurge in struggles.

In order to assess correctly the facts revealed, it is necessary
to examine the political forces that were at work in the
organized working class movement and the relations that
existed among them.

As we have already seen, it was the workers inspired by
the _anti-imperialist_ movement under the _bourgeois_ leadership
that first entered the field of struggle and that the workers
of Bombay, like other sections of the people, had revered
Tilak as "Tilak Maharaj". Lala Lajpat Rai, Dewan Chamanlal,
CR Das and others has been active in the _AITUC_ in its formative years. But the _bourgeois_ leadership
of the Congress was frightened by the growth of the working
class as an independent organized force. In 1922, CR
Das, in his presidential address at the Gaya session of the
Congress, underlined the significance of the interest shown
by the Congress in the labour issue:

>We have delayed the matter already too long. If the
Congress fails to do its duty, you may except to find organisations
set up in the country by Labourers and Peasants
detached from you dissociated from the cause of _Swaraj_,
which will inevitably bring within the arena of the peaceful
revolution _class struggles_ and the war of 'special interests'.
If the object of the Congress be to avoid that disgraceful
issue let us take Labourers and the Peasantry in hand, and
let us organise them both from the point of view of their
own special interest and also from the point of view of
the higher ideal which demands satisfaction of the
'special interests' and the devotion of such interest to the
cause of _Swaraj_.

This was not just the expression of the opinion of an
individual, hut the beginning of a policy which the Congress
as a whole was to adopt in the coming years. The building
up of the organizations of agricultural and industrial workers
was an important item in the _constructive programme_
approved by the Kanpur session of the Congress in 1925. In 1927, the _AICC_ directed the _Working Committee_ to send
propagandists and organizers to the industrial and agricultural
workers. In all those years the Congress leaders had
made concerted efforts to capture the organizational leadership
of the _AITUC_ in which they had been successful to
some extent. Lajpat Rai and CR Das had been the presidents
of the _AITUC_ in its early years.

But this was only one side. On the other, there was a
labour organization in Ahmedabad under the leadership of
Gandhi and his disciples without keeping contact with organizations
like the _AITUC_. It was functioning in accordance with
the infamous Gandhian theory of "trusteeship". Its leaders
were guided by a social outlook of building an organization
"above class struggle", as desired by Das in his Gaya presidential
address.

Whatever the form, it is evident that the Congress
leaders of all persuasions, from Gandhi to Das and Lajpat
Rai, were working with a _bourgeois_ nationalist 'moderate'
outlook. However, they all were nationalists and _anti-imperialists_
and were trying to link the working class with the
_anti-imperialist_ struggle.

Realizing the danger inherent in this approach, the
imperialists and the monopoly capitalists under their protection
desired to bring the growing working class movement in
India under their control without being influenced by Indian
_bourgeois_ nationalism. For this purpose, they sent the
representatives of the _British Labour Party_ and the _British
Trade Union Congress_ to India on several occasions. They
tried to affiliate the _AITUC_ and other trade unions to the
'reformist' International Federation of the Trade Unions based
in Amsterdam (_The Amsterdam International_). Although
they failed in their attempts with regard to _AITUC_, they
succeeded in bringing around certain other trade unions,
including the railwaymen's unions to take a decision
favourable with the _Amsterdam International_.

It was in the midst of these attempts on the part of
Indian _bourgeoisie_ on the one hand, and the leadership of
the _British Labour Party_ on the other, to convert the organized
Indian trade union movement into their appendage
that Communists and other leftists entered the scene with
the message of a revolutionary worker's movement independent
of these two, We have already referred to the attempts
made by the _Communist International_ to form a revolutionary
party of the working class in India by unifying the various
Communist and Socialist groups in the country. We have
also referred to the formation of a _Communist Party of
India_ in 1925 by unifying the various Communist groups in
India. With this emerged a new political force working
within the organized working class movement with a real
working class outlook against the 'reformist' outlook of both
the _bourgeois_ nationalism of the Congress and imperialism
of the _British Labour Party_.

This new revolutionary political force was not, however,
confined to the Communists alone. There had also emerged
in those days various other revolutionary groups including
those of the leftist _Congressmen_ all over the country. The
Communists decided to unify all these groups and form an
organization to fight the _reformism_ both in the Congress
politics and in the trade union movement. The formation
of the various Workers' and Peasants' Parties in 1926 and 1927 was the result of this decision which was warmly
welcomed by other revolutionaries.

The Workers' and Peasants' Parties come into being
first in Bengal, Bombay, Punjab and the United Provinces.
Journals like _Kranti_ in Marathi, _Ganavani_ in Bengali, _Kirti_
in Punjabi and _Mehnatkaksh_ in Urdu were published by the
Party. Muzaffar Ahmad and Sohansingh Josh who later
became prominent Communists and took initiative in these
activities were the editors of _Ganavani_ and _Kirti_, respectively.
Similarly, S.S. Mirajkar and P.C. Joshi were the secretaries
of the Party in Bombay and UP, respectively, Although
the Workers' and Peasants' Parties were more broad based
organizations than that of the Communists, the Communists
were in the leading positions in these parties.

From its inception the Workers' and Peasants' Parties had
been issuing appeals on issues affecting the _anti-imperialist_
movement in general and the organized working class movement
in particular to synchronize with the Congress sessions
and the committee meetings of the Congress. For
example, a summary of the resolution prepared by the Party
in Bombay on the occasion of the _AICC_ meeting in May 1927
is as follows.

A. The present leadership of the Congress has tied
itself and the Congress machinery to a programme of work
which is of benefit only to an insignificant section of the
people, the big capitalist and their allies. ... Therefore, the
bulk of the population have lost all interest in and sympathy
to the Congress.
B. In the interest of the vast majority of the people
it is urgently necessary to free the Congress from the narrow
shackles of class interests, and to yoke it to the task of attaining
national freedom from the imperialist bondage, as a
step towards complete emancipation of the masses from
exploitation and oppression.
C. The aim of the _Indian National Congress_ is (should be) the attainment of complete national independence from
imperialism and the establishment of a _Swaraj_ based upon
universal adult suffrage.
D. It(should) reiterate(s) its faith in _civil disobedience_,
_i.e._, _direct action_ as the only effective weapon that will
ultimately free the people of India from their subject position,
E. but realises that great general awakening will have
to be brought before this weapon of _direct action_ can be
effectively used.

All efforts must be directed to the attainment...of the
general awakening, and for this purpose the Congress(should)
adopt(s) a practical programme.[^12/2]

[^12/2]: G. Adhikari (ed), _Documents of the History of the Communist Party of India_,
Vol III B, 1979, pp. 169--170.

The resolution also pointed to the immediate issues affecting
the workers and peasants and suggested solutions to
these issues.

It must be stated specifically that the Workers' and
Peasants' Party with Communists in leading positions adopted
this resolution before the Congress adopted the resolution
of _full independence_ at the Madras session. For there was
a myth widely circulated all over the country that the Congress
adopted the objective of _full independence_ solely due to
the efforts of certain leftwing _Congressmen_ like Jawaharlal
Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose. This is not the truth.

From the beginning of the _Communist International_,
some _Indian Communists_ had tried to maintain lively contact
with the ordinary nationalists who were far more numerous
than themselves to build up a united revolutionary movement
in the country, In parallel to this, an organized mass
movement of the working class was growing. The _bourgeois_
national leadership of the Congress on the one said, and the
imperialist 'reformist' leadership of the _British Labour Party_
on the other had tried to capture the leadership of this movement.
Against this, the Workers' and Peasants' Parties had
emerged under the leadership of the Communists as a broad
mass revolutionary front to organize the working class on
a revolutionary basis and to establish unity with the leftwing
of the _bourgeois_ nationalist movement. The leftwing
_Congressmen_ including Nehru and Bose who came under
the influence of these developments fought for _full independence_.
This was the fact.

The enthusiastic march by 50,000 workers to the _pandal_
of the Calcutta session of the Congress in which Jawaharlal
Nehru and Bose were forcefully arguing for _full independence_
was a lively demonstration of this. It was a spectacular
demonstration of fraternity and unity between the leftists
among the _bourgeois_-_petty-bourgeois_ sections and the working
class which was moving towards the left.

## MEERUT AND LAHORE

This surge of the revolutionary working class angered
the British rulers who decided to suppress it. Consequently, the
government filed a _conspiracy case_ in the Meerut magistrate's
court against the Communists and _non-Communists_
working among the workers and peasants.

In order to explain the background to this case which is
known as the "_Meerut Conspiracy Case_", it is necessary to
bring at least in brief the growth of the movement of the
workers and peasants and also its impact on the nationalists
and _Congressmen_ both the left and the right.

As we have seen earlier, the Madras session of the Congress
adopted a number of resolutions of _anti-imperialism_ in
content along with the resolution on _full independence_. It
was in order to systematize the day-to-day activities of the
Congress in accordance with this new approach that Jawaharlal
Nehru was selected as one of the general secretaries
of the Congress.

With this, an important change began to appear in the
general outlook of the Congress. The Congress accepted the
fact that India's _freedom struggle_ was an inseparable part
of the world-wide _anti-imperialist_ struggle. Symbolic of it
was the relationship that the Congress had established with
the international organization of the _League against Imperialism_.
Both the leftwing Congressman Jawaharlal Nehru and
the right-wing Congressman Motilal Nehru attended its
conference. Their visit to Moscow, followed by the publication
of Jawaharlal's impressions of the Soviet Union, had
their impact on the leftists both inside and outside the Congress.
The Indian patriots, for once, realized that the constant
_anti-Soviet_ and _anti-Communist_ propaganda made by
the rulers was intended to protect their own vested interests.

An important section of the revolutionaries outside the
Congress was those who were engaged in 'bomb-politics' and
known as terrorists. Many of them (especially in Bengal)
were Congress workers. Even those who were not _Congressmen_
had the sympathy of a considerable section of the
Congress leaders. The first indication of a substantial change
in the general outlook of this section was the growth of the
Communist movement. The ideas propagated by the
Communist and _non-Communist_ activists of the Workers'
and Peasants' Parties began to spread among them. A clear
evidence of such a change was the formation of the
_Hindustan Socialist Republican Association_ under the leadership
of Bhagat Singh in Punjab which spread to all over
the country. In a letter sent from the prison before his martyrdom,
Bhagat Singh said:

>The real fight for freedom
can only be fought by mobilising _Mazdurs_[^mazdur], _Kisans_[^kisan] and the
common people. ... It is my considered opinion that bombs
cannot serve our purpose. This is proved by the history of
the _Hindustan Socialist Republican Association_. ... Our chief
aim should be to mobilise the toiling masses.[^12/3]

[^mazdur]: Mazdur = Worker

[^kisan]: Kisan = Farmer

[^12/3]: Manmathnath Gupta, _Bhagat Singh and His Times_, New Delhi, Lipi Prakashan 1977, pp. 189--191.

This change, however, did nut detract them from the
'bomb-politics'. On the contrary, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar
Dutt threw bombs at the Central Assembly when it was
in session, following which they were arrested and after a
prolonged trial, sentenced to death.

Even while engaged in these activities, a political rethinking
was going on among them. In those days when people
in general were thinking in terms of either the 'bomb-politics'
of the revolutionaries or the Gandhian _non-violence_, the
propaganda carried out by the Workers' and Peasants' Parties
and the _Communist Party_ exerted influence on them in
this re-thinking. Many of the co-accused in the Central
Assembly bombing case in which Bhagat Singh was sentenced
to death became active workers of the _Communist Party_
after their release from prison. One of them, the late Ajoy
Kumar Ghosh, was the General Secretary of the undivided
_Communist Party of India_ for over a decade. The emotional
memoirs he wrote about his former colleagues including
Bhagat Singh reflect the change the young generation of the
_petty-bourgeoisie_ was undergoing half a century ago. One
of their contemporaries Shiva Varma, affectionately called
'Shivda', is still an active worker of the _Communist Party
of India_ (Marxist) in Kanpur.

In addition to this change among the adherents of the
'bomb-politics', a revolutionary enthusiasm was spreading
rapidly among the _petty-bourgeois_ youth also, including those
who had hitherto remained apolitical. This was another
important feature of the 1928--29 period. Youth organizations
were being formed throughout the country embracing all
trends of thought, from Gandhism to the ideology of 'bomb
politics'. What linked them together was the idea of _direct
action_ rallying the entire working masses for _full independence_.

The growth of these organizations went parallel with the
upswing of the workers' and peasants' organizations. These
two channels came together to form the great movement of
the _Independence League_ under the leadership of Jawaharlal
Nehru, Subhas Bose and others.

All these had influenced the Congress leadership as a
whole. Those who opposed the British propaganda that the
Communists were mischief-makers and Russian agents included
some well-known right-wing _Congressmen_. For instance,
Motilal Nehru, whose only relation with the left movement
was that he was the father of a leftist, stoutly defended the
Communists in the Central Legislative Assembly.

This was not an isolated opinion of an individual.
Rather, certain events that took place in the Central Legislative
Assembly towards the end of 1928 and early 1929
showed that this was the general opinion prevailing among
members of the _Congress Parliamentary Party_ who were
known to be _rightists_.

The Government of India introduced two bills, the
_Public Safety Bill_ and the _Trades Disputes Bill_, to face the
rapidly spreading revolutionary movement of the working
class. The target of both bills was the worker and peasant
movement. From a class point of view, the Congress
leaders in the Assembly should have been substantially in
agreement with the bills. They, however, strongly opposed
them. While Motilal Nehru, Lajpat Rai and others in the
opposition exposed the monstrous character of the bills, the
President of the Central Assembly, Vithalbhai Patel, cornered
the Government by his historic rulings.

The stated objective of the _Public Safety Bill_ was to
"prevent the activities of foreign Communists in India".
Apparently, the bill would not apply even to _Indian Communists_.
However, the Congress members in the Assembly
argued that it could be used against the _non-Communist_
nationalists.

According to the bill, it was an offence to argue directly
or indirectly for the overthrow of the "legally constituted
government in British India". Pointing to this provision in
the bill, Lajpat Rai stated that even Jawaharlal Nehru and
Srinivasa Iyengar who argued for _full independence_ would
come within the purview of the bill.

It was obvious that the Congress leadership realized
that the weapon of the repressive laws being introduced on
the pretext of curbing activities of foreign Communists in
India would turn against all freedom fighters. In other
words, the antagonism of the _bourgeoisie_ as a class towards
the Communists and the working class gave way to the opposition
of the entire national movement including the
_bourgeoisie_ to imperialism.

The plan of the government to get the _Public Safety
Bill_ through quickly was defeated by the determined opposition
of the members belonging to the Congress and other
opposition parties. Despite mustering the full strength of
nominated members in favour of the bill, the voting on the
bill was 61 for and 61 against. The president of the Assembly,
Vithalbhai Patel exercised his casting vote against the
bill and consequently the bill was rejected. Following this,
the _Public Safety bill_ and the _Trades Disputes Bill_ came to be
widely debated, which together with the historic rulings of
the President of the Assembly filled the newspaper columns.

It was in the last phase of this, on 8th April 1929, the
day on which the Government got the _Trades Disputes Bill_
passed disregarding the opposition that the historic bomb
attack inside the Assembly took place. Bhagat Singh and
Dutt who dropped the bombs did not try to escape by running
away from the scene, but threw the leaflets carried by
them, shouted slogans like "Long Live the Revolution", and
stood firm to court arrest.

This incident which enthralled millions of youngmen
including the present author was symbolic of the contradictions
in the political approach of Bhagat Singh and his
comrades who had been moving from the 'bomb-politics' to the
politics of mass struggle. Throwing bomb like revolutionaries
who have no faith in _non-violence_, raising slogans and
courting arrest, knowing that giving in meant gallows, like
Gandhian _satyagrahis_, distributing leaflets calling for mass
struggles like Communists --- all these were combined in an
action which was, in fact, a pointer to the future revolutionary
politics in India.

This was followed by the _Lahore Conspiracy Case_
leading to the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Rajaguru and
Sukhdev. Almost simultaneously, the _Meerut conspiracy
Case_ was also in progress.

The background of the Meerut case is as follows. In
December 1928, an all-India conference was held in Meerut
to form a national organization of the Workers' and Peasants'
Parties which were started in the provinces of Bombay,
Bengal, UP[^up] and Punjab and later spread to other parts of
India. Over a hundred delegates from the different parts of
the country attended the conference which adopted a common
minimum programme for these parties in the different
provinces. Besides, the conference condemned the Motilal
Report which satisfied itself with a scheme with less than
_Dominion Status_, and advocated strongly a programme of
_direct action_ for _full independence_.

[^up]: United Provinces (Current day State of Uttar Pradesh)

Over 30 activists of the Workers' and Peasants' Parties
who attended this conference were accused in the _Meerut
Conspiracy Case_. They included the well-known Communist
leaders like PC Joshi, Dr. G. Adhikari, SA Dange, Muzaffar
Ahmad and SV Ghate. Besides, three Englishmen
working in India representing the British working class and
the Socialist-Communist movements, were also among the
accused. Among them, Philip Spratt and Lester Hutchinson
later left politics. The third, Ben Bradley, worked tirelessly
till his last days as one of the British Communist leaders
paying special attention to India affairs.

The government utilized the _Conspiracy Case_ to 'expose'
Communism and the Soviet Union. The Communists, on the
other hand, used it in accordance with the tradition set by
Karl Marx in the historic _Cologne trial_ as a platform to expose
the existing social and state structure and to prove the
inevitability of a social revolution. The statement signed by
all the accused Communists, except Dange, and read out
by RS Nimbkar in the court was a document which analyzed
the Indian situation on the basis of _Marxist-Leninist_
outlook. (Dange was not a member of the party and hence
not a signatory of the statement. He made a separate statement.)

The fact that the _Meerut Conspiracy Case_ and the
_Lahore Conspiracy Case_ were going on simultaneously was
meaningful. The reports of these trials contained facts and
arguments which helped millions of youth in the country to
choose between the path of mass revolutionary struggles and
'bomb-politics' based on adventurism. What is more, the letter
sent by Bhagat Singh from jail and the subsequent activities
of Ajoy Ghosh, Siva Varma and other accused in the Lahore
case revealed that the reports of the Meerut case had influenced
them considerably.

The years 1928 and 1929 were crucial. A new mass upsurge,
new sections of people entering into the political arena
for the first time, new attempts to link the Indian _freedom
struggle_ with the world-wide _anti-imperialist_ movement and
the _resultant_ new streams of thought in the old parties and
organizations themselves --- these were the factors that gave
vitality and life to the Lahore session of the Congress held
towards the end of 1929 and to the subsequent _civil disobedience
movement_ under Gandhi's leadership and made them
historic.
