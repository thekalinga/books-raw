# WAR-TIME NATIONAL UPSURGE

## "ENEMY'S ENEMY, THE FRIEND"

The British rulers had a definite aim in view in revoking
the partition of Bengal, in encouraging the 'moderates'
against the 'extremists' and in preparing the ground for the
emergence of the _Muslim League_. And that was to stem the
advance of the national struggle, and as a part of the strategy,
to isolate the 'extremists' from the 'moderates' and the Muslims
from non-Muslims. To a great extent, they were successful
in their attempts. But, this success was only temporary.

There were inherent contradictions in the policies adopted
by the rulers to stem the tide of the national struggle, which
began to surface soon after the beginning of a new upsurge
more powerful and widespread than the anti-partition
agitation.

As we have seen earlier, the rulers thought it's possible
to rally the Muslim community in favour of the partition and
against the basic slogans raised by the anti-partition agitators.
But, what happened really was something different. As the
Muslims as a community decided to enter into politics, they
began to turn against the Hindus, on the one hand, and against
the British, on the other.

When the rulers, yielding to the pressure of the general
nationalist movement, decided to unify Bengal, it shook
the rapport which the leaders of the Muslim community had
with the rulers at the time of the emergence of the _Muslim
League_. The founders of the _Muslim League_ described this
decision as an event which proved the "stupidity of rallying
against the sister communities with the help of foreign
powers".

Furthermore, before long, circumstances arose wherein
many of the big and small West Asian Muslim countries,
including Turkey, got into a war against Britain. The Balkan
War of 1912 and the First World War which erupted two years
later, created _anti-British_ feelings among the Muslim masses
of various countries, including India. That is, contrary to the
expectations entertained by the British rulers when they
encouraged the formation of the _Muslim League_, the organized
public opinion of the Muslim community began to take
an _antiBritish_ turn. It was in that direction that world politics
and Indian politics had turned.

These circumstances brought many Muslim youths, like
Maulana Abul Kalam Azad who later became eminent in
Indian politics, to _anti-imperialist_ politics. Azad has referred
in his _autobiography_ to the criticism made by the Arab and
Turkish revolutionaries of the stand taken by the Indian
Muslims of not participating in the struggle for Indian independence,
when he visited the Arab countries in 1908. The
Urdu newspaper _Hilal_, which he started on his return to India,
played a significant role in spreading the ideas of revolutionary
politics among the Muslims.

Maulana Mohamed Ali, who later played a leading role
in the _Khilafat_ movement, brought forth the antagonism
between England, on the one hand, and the Islamic nations
like Turkey, Persia (Iran) and Morocco, on the other, and
to its repercussions on the Indian Muslims. He also referred
to an incident in which he himself came into conflict with the
government in 1913. Briefly, things were moving in a direction
which created doubts in the minds of the British rulers
as to whether their hope of utilizing the Muslims as an
organized community against the other sections of the people
would be belied.

If the attitude of the Muslim community which had, at
least temporarily, rallied against the national independence
movement was of the nature stated above, it is needless to
speak of the attitude of the Indian revolutionaries at home
and abroad. Although the decision to revoke the partition of
Bengal and to introduce new _administrative reforms_ served
to appease the 'moderates', it did not cool down the fire of intense
feelings of the 'extremists' and the revolutionaries in India.
On the other hand, it actually intensified it further. These
developments created in then, the hope of bringing the rulers
down to their knees, if only revolutionary actions were carried
on in a more determined and organized manner.

The revolutionaries living outside the country in the
background of the Balkan War and the First World War,
however, adopted the attitude of "the enemy of the enemy is
the friend". They formulated a plan to enlist the support and
assistance of the governments of Germany, Japan, America
and the post-revolutionary Russia (at the end of the war)
and the governments of the neighbouring countries of Afghanistan
and other West Asian Muslim countries to the
movement for India's national independence. They concentrated
their efforts in Germany, since they thought that
Germany, being the most powerful enemy of Britain, would
naturally take interest in weakening it.

The German ruling circles thought that large-scale export
of arms for the use of the Indian revolutionaries and providing
them training in their use as well as the technical
know-how to make bombs and other equipments would create
a new situation in India, compelling the British to deploy a
considerable section of their army from the European front
to India, which would, in turn, change the course of the war
in Europe in their favour. This was the hope the rulers
of Germany had entertained in cooperating with Indian
revolutionaries.

Accordingly, discussions were held between the German
Government and the Indian revolutionaries living in Germany
with a view to serve the interests of both the parties.
A committee to aid India, consisting of Indians and Germans
as members, was formed to assist the revolutionary activities
in India. All these developments took place within a month
after the outbreak of the war between Britain and Germany.
This committee was later on reorganized with the Germans
withdrawing from it.

We have already noted that Indian revolutionaries were
active in many countries like England, France, Canada and
America. Many of these countries were directly opposed
to Germany in the war. Consequently, Indians in these
countries could not expect to get help from them. In fact,
the governments of these countries, as participants in the war
against Germany, were keen to ensure that no activities
against the interests of Britain took place in their countries.
So, as the war broke out, Germany became the centre of
activities of the Indian revolutionaries living abroad.

In the initial stages of the war, America remained
neutral and Russia was against Germany. But, towards
the end of the war, the situation changed drastically.
America allied itself with Britain and France against
Germany, whereas Russia, where a new Bolshevik Government
was established following the _October Revolution_ of 1917,
kept out of the war. In the circumstances, the _anti-British_ revolutionary
activities which were being carried out in America
during the earlier stages of the war came to an end. At the
same time, the Indian revolutionaries sought to get in contact
with the post-revolutionary Bolshevik government of Russia.

Germany remained the main centre of the organized
activities of the overseas Indian revolutionaries during both
the initial and later stages of the war. It was from Germany
that delegations were sent to America and other countries to
coordinate the activities of the revolutionaries in all countries.
In fact, the Berlin committee functioned as the centre to
make arrangement for sending to India as many arms and
trained personnel as possible.

In the early stage of the war, when America had
remained neutral, a German diplomatic office functioning
there made arrangements to acquire large supplies of arms,
ammunition and other weapons. There was a plan to buy 8000 fire-arms and 40 lakhs bullets and other materials and
ship them to India secretly. The necessary funds for this
purpose were provided by the German government.

Similarly, various other activities were planned in
countries like Japan, China, Indo-China, Philippines and
Indonesia. The Islamic countries of West Asia rendered
assistance in a more open manner. Several Muslim revolutionaries
from India visited these countries and established
relations with the rulers there. Utilizing this opportunity,
many non-Muslim revolutionaries also followed them. Several
revolutionary organizations emerged in which revolutionaries
belonging to the different communities could work together.

As a result of all these activities a "_Provisional
Revolutionary Government_" was formed in Afghanistan
in December 1915, with Raja Mahendra Pratap as President,
Barkatulla as Prime Minister and Obeidulla as Home Minister.
This revolutionary government become another centre of
revolutionary activities as the "_Aid-India Committee_" of
Berlin.

Side by side with the activities of the revolutionaries in
Berlin and other centres, plans had been made to organize
_anti-British_ insurrections in India and the neighbouring countries.
In Singapore, a military mutiny was carried out. Of the
two military contingents stationed there, a British battalion
had been shifted leaving an Indian battalion to guard the area.
There were about 300 German prisoners in their custody.
Taking this opportunity, the organizers of the mutiny tried to
free the German prisoners and arrest or even kill the high
military officers. They also planned to organize the military
personnel to kill the Englishmen and liberate Singapore from
the British. Similar plans were also made in Burma and several
other South East Asian centres to organize mutiny and liberate
the region.

Within India, arrangements were made to organize
countrywide revolts using the arms to be obtained from
America and other countries. The main role in these activities
was played by the revolutionaries of Bengal, the Muslim
revolutionaries of Punjab and the surrounding areas and the
revolutionaries who had arrived from America, Canada,
Japan, China, Philippines and other countries taking the
pledge to work for a successful revolution in India. There
was also a small leadership core to coordinate the activities
of the various revolutionary groups spread over areas from
East Bengal and Orissa to Punjab and to organize revolts on
a prescribed day in accordance with a plan made for the
purpose. This was the most well organized venture ever
undertaken after the 1857 revolt.

But, the plan failed to materialize. Although the ship
carrying arms supplies from America reached the specified
place on schedule, they did not reach the destination on
account of the failure of the plan to receive and distribute
the shipment.

The military revolts and similar other ventures also
ultimately failed. The details of the revolts planned in India
were made known to the authorities through the British spies
who had infiltrated into the leading group organizing the
revolt, enabling the authorities to crush the revolt before it
broke out. Thus, this revolt also met with the same fate as
did the earlier revolts like the one in 1857. Many of the
participants became victims of arrests and repression. The
British began to take action further to consolidate their power
with the satisfaction of having totally suppressed the planned
revolts.

For the revolutionaries, however, this defeat was, in
fact, the beginning of another upsurge, as it had often been
the case with earlier setbacks. Even before the end of the
World War, the _anti-imperialist_ movement had begun to gain
strength in various other forms, which turned into a countrywide
mass upsurge in the post-war years.

## THE MATURED _BOURGEOISIE_

As we have seen, both the revolts of 1857 and those
that took place during the World War ended unsuccessfully,
However, there is a significant difference between the revolts
of these two periods.

The First World War broke out after the rise of a new
(_bourgeois_) class leadership in place of the old decadent
feudal domination. In 1857, this new class in India was
growing in its womb. Consequently, it could give rise only
to social reform movements of the type started by Ram
Mohan Roy and others as the primary form of _bourgeois_
development. Since its aim was to appreciate and copy the
British civilization, rather than conducting an _anti-British_
struggle, the leadership of the 1857 revolt was in the hands of
the feudal forces. That is, the _bourgeois_ modernization movement
that emerged in the form of the social reform movement
was against an _anti-British_ struggle. On the other hand,
the First World War broke out after the Indian _bourgeoisie_
rose to the position of leadership of an organized national
movement which, started with raising slogans of social reform,
entered the phase of raising economic and political demands.

In the years immediately preceding the war and
during the war, Indian _bourgeoisie_ recorded an unprecedented
growth. Rather than confining themselves to light industries
like cotton textiles, they entered the field of heavy
industries considered to be the heart of industrialization.
In the years immediately preceding the war, the first steel
mill in India was established with the initiative of the Tata
family. This was the first heavy industry established in
Asia with the exception of only Japan, which constituted the
economic evidence to the maturity the Indian _bourgeoisie_
had attained.

All industries in India including this steel mill grew on
an unprecedented pace during the war. Under the conditions
of war, the Indian Government could not but increase production
in the Indian industrial sector and use Indian industrial
products. They were thus compelled to an extent to go back
on the earlier policy of discouraging the development of
Indian industries.

At the same time, Indian capitalists came into contact
with capitalists in countries like America and France who
were interested in a victory of the British camp in the war
and sought their cooperation in the development of industries
in India. For instance, Tata made an attempt to negotiate
with the American capitalists for the expansion of the steel
mill. Though it did not succeed, it helped to maintain the
relations in the years to come. The progress the Indian
_bourgeoisie_ achieved in the economic field got reflected
itself in the political field. They no longer handled Indian
politics as "the most loyal subjects of the Crown" as
before, but firmly demanded certain political rights in
return for the assistance they rendered to the rulers under
the prevailing world situation in general, and in the war in
particular. That is, the Indian _bourgeoisie_ had grown as a
class confident in its growing strength, and working with the
objective of gaining _self-rule_, step by step, through negotiations
with the British.

The split in the Congress and the formation of the
_Muslim League_ were regarded at that time as a setback to
an advance in this direction. But that was not the truth.
The 'moderate' leaders of the Congress after the split, the
'extremists' functioning as a separate party outside the Congress,
and the _Muslim League_ formed with the blessings of
the British rulers against the Congress --- all of them were
working, though in different forms, in accordance with
the aspirations of the Indian _bourgeoisie_.

Even the 'moderate'-led Congress incorporated in its constitution
the objective of _self-rule_ within the British Empire.
It may be recalled that it was on this issue that the 'moderates'
and 'extremists' had fought within the Congress. The 'moderates'
had now accepted the objective suggested earlier by the
'extremists'. Both sections had made it clear that the differences
between them were not on the objective but only on
the means of achieving the objective. Nor was the _Muslim
League_ opposed to the aim of _self-rule_; what they were
demanding was the due share of the Muslim community after
India was granted _self-rule_. Thus, although divided into
three camps, the Indian _bourgeoisie_ constituted one class
with a common objective of _self-rule_.

The policies and programmes proposed and sought to
be implemented by the revolutionaries to achieve this objective
were acceptable to none of these sections. None of
them subscribed to the programme of conducting a revolution
in India with the assistance of the _anti-British_ powers, including
Germany, on the principle of "enemy's enemy is one's
friend".

At the same time, none of them was prepared to accept
and meekly submit as "loyal subjects of the British" to
whatever the British rulers did. On the contrary, they did
not hesitate to press India's right to _self-government_ and to
carry on agitations to win that demand, simultaneously rendering
all possible help to the British in effectively conducting
the war. In other words, they all adopted the policy of
gaining more power by taking advantage of the crisis the
rulers were facing and also of the fact that they needed
India's assistance in facing the crisis. Thus, in 1916 the
Congress and the _Muslim League_ jointly accepted, in principle,
the objective of _self-government_ for India and decided
to bring pressure on the rulers for _administrative reforms_
with wider powers to the Indians. As a first step towards
realizing this objective, they reached an understanding on the
share which the Muslim and non-Muslim communities should
get under the new extended powers. Simultaneously, steps
were also taken to remove the impediments in the way of
'extremists' rejoining the Congress, thus paving the way for
restoring unity in the Congress.

Although these efforts fructified only two years after
the commencement of the war, the work in this direction had
started much earlier. Thus, a Hindu-Muslim convention
was held in Allahabad in January 1911. The convention in
which 60 Hindu and 40 Muslim representatives participated,
however, failed to arrive at a decision. But Gokhale who
played a prominent role in the convention, advised that the
"misgivings in the minds of the Muslims about the domination
of the Hindu majority should not be dismissed lightly".

Following this, talks were held between the leaders of
the Congress and the _Muslim League_ in different forms and
at different places. The leaders of both the organizations
were convinced that the power to be shared between them
could be won from the British only if they resolve the
differences between them and stand unitedly.

Similar efforts were also made to bring about a
reconciliation between the 'moderates' and the 'extremists' within
the Congress. But no progress could be made in these efforts
until the beginning of the war, mainly because many of the
'extremist' leaders were either in prison or were subjected to
other forms of repression.

The situation began to change soon after the outbreak
of the war. Tilak was released from prison. The urge for restoring
unity within the Congress was also strong among the
'moderates'. Many made efforts to bring the 'extremists' back
in the fold of the Congress by holding discussions with
Gokhale and Tilak separately. After his release from the
prison, Tilak also was holding an attitude helpful to bring
about unity. He unambiguously declared that he, for one, did
not approve of violence as a means to win the demand for
_self-government_. Denying that he and his party were following
the policy of _boycott_, Tilak pointed out that many prominent
members of his party were functioning as members of
municipalities and legislatures. He had overtly and covertly
approved of their activities.

Nevertheless, it was not easy to restore unity between the
'moderates' and 'extremists' in the Congress. Leaders like
Pherozeshah Mehta and Gokhale of the 'moderate' group
continued to maintain hostility towards the 'extremists' as
before. Only after the passing away of these two eminent
leaders could unity be restored in the Congress.

As a result of the efforts made for about six years, unity
in the Congress was achieved in 1915. The reunited Congress
and the _Muslim League_ expressed their opinions on the
details of the _administrative reforms_ that India must achieve.
Both the organizations held their respective annual conferences
at the same place (Lucknow) to give approval to the
proposals of _administrative reforms_ prepared jointly by
them. It became clear that the Indian _bourgeoisie_, divided
into two organizations (the Congress and the _League_), had a
common objective and a common practical programme.
True, this unity was not enduring; the two organizations
continued to clash with each other. As a result of capitalist
development, new generations of _bourgeoisie_ began to emerge
from among the various communities which hitherto had
remained backward. This new generation of the _bourgeoisie_
from among the _non-Brahmins_ in some provinces, the
depressed castes all over India and the Christian and Sikh
religious minorities, etc., began to form their own organizations,
as did the Muslims earlier, and raise the question of
sharing power. It was as a natural consequence of this that
the "_communal question_" became an integral part of Indian
politics, which culminated in the partition of the country
into Indian Union and Pakistan. The ordinary _bourgeois_
nationalist is unhappy about this development and put the
blame on the British as well as on the Muslim communalists.
But he never bothers to go deep into the historical background
of these developments. India is a country with two major
religions, the Hindus and the Muslims, in addition to other
religious minorities, and several castes among the Hindus
themselves. The _bourgeoisie_ that emerged from among these
different religions and castes possessed the character of their
respective religions and castes. Therefore, although they have
uniformity and common interest with regard to _bourgeois_
development, these different _bourgeois_ sections have to
protect the interest of the _bourgeoisie_ belonging to their
respective religions and castes. The _bourgeois_ nationalist does
not understand that this is the fact that underlies the
"_communal question_".

The Lucknow agreement of 1916 was the strongest evidence
to show that the Indian _bourgeoisie_ had realized the fact
that despite the difference in interest as members of particular
castes and religions, they belonged to the same class and
have to stand united to face the British rulers. The same
realization was witnessed also at the _Round Table Conferences_
and in various negotiations. Although each maintained
its identity, they adopted an approach of jointly raising the
common demand before the rulers and fighting each other on
the details with regard to the winning of the demand.

As noticed earlier, the revolutionaries were trying to
organize an _anti-British_ revolt with the help of Germany and
other world powers. As distinct from this, the 'moderates',
the 'extremists', the _Muslim League_ and all other _bourgeois_
politicians took the attitude that "_England's need is India's
opportunity_". Realizing that organizing a revolt was dangerous,
they not only kept themselves away from it, but also
formulated the strategy of agitation and negotiation on the
belief that if enough pressure was exerted on the British, it
would be possible to gain more powers step by step leading
finally to _self-rule_.

Later events proved that this strategy was more 'practical'
than that of the revolutionaries. The class forces, particularly
the class-conscious working class, capable of ending the
British rule by revolutionary means had not yet developed.
Therefore, the _freedom struggle_ was fought under the leadership
of the _bourgeoisie_ who had already become strong
enough to carry on that struggle. And it was the _bourgeoisie_
alone which has benefited from independence, because it was
into their hands that power was transferred 31 years after
the _Lucknow Pact_, and it was only a handful of monopolists
capable of collaborating with foreign monopolists and the
landlords that were able to grow further by exercising
this power. The masses of people, on the other hand, were
getting more and more pauperized as an inevitable consequences
of capitalist development. Furthermore, the _freedom
struggle_ culminated in the division of the country into two,
and in the death of thousands of people in communal riots.

The Indian _bourgeoisie_ acquired the capability to bargain
with the British rulers and to exert pressure on them with
popular support. And this was what became manifest in
Indian politics during the war.

## THE _HOME RULE LEAGUE_

The 'moderates' feared that if the Congress constitution
and rules were amended enabling the 'extremists' to take part
in its activities, the entire organization would go into their
hands. Subsequent events proved that this fear was not
unfounded. For instance, Tilak was accorded grand receptions
by the masses of the people all along the way to the Congress
session held for the first time after the split. And in the
Congress session held a year later, Mrs. Annie Besant, who
had been a supporter of the 'extremists', was elected president.
The 'moderates' had hitherto been keeping the party presidentship
as their exclusive preserve by defeating the proposals to
elect Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai to that position. Now a
person of radical orientation had been elected president.
This was a clear indication of the political changes that
had come about during the war.

This was a development which caused anxiety to the
British rulers as well as the 'moderates'. The Home Member
of the Viceroy's Executive Council wrote in a secret dispatch
in January 1913:

>The position is one of great difficulty.
The 'Moderate' leaders can command no support among the
vocal classes who are being led at the heels of Tilak and
Besant.[^08/1]
 
It was this situation that motivated the Government
of India to propose certain _administrative reforms_ to
placate the 'moderates'.

[^08/1]: Reginald Craddock, quoted in Tara Chand, _op. cit_, p. 450.

But the political evaluation made by the 'moderates' went
wrong in one respect. They thought that things would be
all right if the 'extremists' were denied re-entry into the Congress.
This was totally baseless, for, the 'extremists' were
able to propagate their own political line even while remaining
outside the Congress. Besides, a capitalist class had
already developed in the country, determined to widen its
power by exerting maximum pressure on the rulers. The
'extremists' were, therefore, in a position to carry on their
work in accordance with their own political outlook, irrespective
of whether they were inside or outside the Congress.

A new political organization, the _Home Rule League_,
appeared on the scene as the organizational form of the
activities of the 'extremists'. To be exact, two organizations
of the same name emerged in 1915, one formed by Tilak in
Maharashtra and the other by Annie Besant in Madras.

Tilak had been released from prison in the middle of 1914. The scene he witnessed in the country on his release
appeared to him to be entirely different from what it was
when he was taken to the prison. Accordingly, he proposed
certain changes in the polices and programmes of his party.
The main theme of this change was the new outlook of the
_bourgeoisie_: "_England's need is India's opportunity_".

It may be recalled that Tilak brought forth the radical
politics as opposed to the politics of the 'moderates', stressing
the need to organize agitations to achieve _Swaraj_. Many
thought that he would advocate opposition to the British,
denying the assistance needed by them more than ever before
on account of the situation created by the war. Instead, he
openly declared willingness to fully cooperate with the British
to win the war. He suggested formation of a '_citizens' army_'
with large-scale recruitment from among the people to fight
the war. He thought that training in arms and experience
in warfare for a people who had been disarmed under the
British rule would help brighten the future of India.
Accordingly, he engaged himself in the recruitment of the
people to the army on a big scale.

This was only one aspect of Tilak's political outlook.
The _Home Rule League_ which was organized under his initiative
represented the other aspect of his political outlook.
Tilak argued that if Indians were in be motivated to participate
actively in the war efforts of the British, they must be convinced
that the success in the war would help them realize their
political objective and that India should be granted _home
rule_'.

Accordingly, the _Home Rule League_ was formed in
April, 1916 in Maharashtra. Though it was under his initiative,
he was not even an office bearer of the organization.
Through his journals he gave the widest possible publicity to
the idea of _Home Rule_. Explaining the need to form such an
organization, he wrote: It has generally been accepted that
the time has come for organizing public opinion in favour of
'_Home Rule_' and for launching an agitation for it. The
authority for taking up this task with responsibility naturally
lies with the Congress. The 'moderates' have, however, rejected
the proposal for organizing a _Home Rule League_ on
the plea that the Congress was engaged in the task of preparing
a scheme for _self-government_. The Congress, being a
big, unwieldy and loosely organized body, is unable to evolve
a scheme for _Home Rule_ and to work actively for the
political success of that movement. As such, there must be
someone to do the primary base work for this. No time can
be lost in this regard, any further. The _League_ will be an
organization that intends to take the initiative in this regard.

Even before the release of Tilak from prison, Annie
Besant had started an agitation for _home rule_ with its centre
at Madras. She also had carried her activities to England.
Since, unlike Tilak, she was one of the recognized leaders
of the Congress, Mrs. Besant introduced a resolution in the
Congress proposing the formation of a separate organization,
_Home Rule League_, to carry on the work for _home rule_.
The Congress, however, rejected the resolution. Instead, it
appointed a committee with Mrs. Besant as a member to
"formulate a scheme for _self-rule_". Mrs. Besant was
therefore committed to abide by the decision till the committee
completed its work. As soon as that work was over,
she felt herself free to organize the _Home Rule League_
without going against the decisions of the Congress. Thus,
the _Home Rule League_ was formed in Madras in September 1916.

Although the _Home Rule League_ was born as two parallel
organizations under separate leaderships, the aims and objects
and the immediate programmes of both were identical.
Both campaigned with the aim of organizing popular agitation
by rallying the people behind the demand of maximum
autonomy possible within the British Empire and to reach its
echo in the domestic politics of England.

In the words of Mrs. Besant, "The price of India's
loyalty is India's freedom". In other words, England need
not expect unconditional assistance from India to face the
situation created by the war, and it will get India's full cooperation
only if her right to independence was recognized.

Subsequently, when she was elected president of the
Congress, she had stated in her presidential speech:

>Early in the war, I ventured to say that the war could not
end until England recognised that autocracy and bureaucracy
must perish in India as well as in Europe. The
good Bishop of Calcutta, with a courage worthy of his
free race, lately declared that it would be hypocritical to
pray for victory over autocracy in Europe and to maintain
it in India.[^08/2]

[^08/2]: A. M. Zaidi, _The Encyclopaedia of Indian National Congress_,
Volume VII, New Delhi, Chand and Company, 1979, p. 171.

She said that India demanded _home rule_ for two
reasons. One was inevitable and of vital importance and
the other, too, though not of the same importance, had its
own significance. The first was that freedom was the birth-right
of every nation. India's interests had been subjected
to the interests of British imperialism without her consent.
The second was that India's economic resources were not
being utilized in the most useful way for India. This would
be evident if the expenditures incurred on elementary education
and on the army maintained mainly for imperialist
aggression were compared with each other.

Although formed as two parallel organizations, one under
the leadership of Tilak and the other under Mrs. Besant, the
emergence of the _Home Rule_ movement was an important
event in Indian political history. Sir Subramonia Iyer, who
was the President of the _Home Rule League_ led by Annie
Besant (he was a former Judge and acting Chief Justice)
wrote a letter to President Wilson of the United States stating:

>We are today a slave nation. We have been chained. But, if
we are promised _Home Rule_ immediately, we shall be able
to send 5 million men to the war within 3 months and five
million more in another 3 months.

Iyer's letter caused a stir internationally. It came to the
notice of the Congress of the United States. Britain's refusal
to concede the demands of the people of India came under
criticism in various other countries. Even in England, it raised
a lot of furore. Montagu, Secretary of State for India,
characterized the letter as "shameful". In protest, Iyer
renounced his titles of 'Knighthood' and '_Dewan_ Bahadur'.
Tilak also sent a letter to the president of the _Peace Convention_
held at the close of war, in which he pointed out that a
free India would be a great source of strength to the world
organization that was to be established.

The leaders of the _Home Rule_ movement did not confine
themselves to writing letters to the rulers of foreign countries.
A delegation led by Lala Lajpat Rai was sent to the United
States to attract the attention of the American people to Indian
freedom. According to a report sent by N. S. Hardikar, a
member of the delegation, he addressed meetings at 83 places.
He mentioned specifically the reception accorded to him in
colleges, newspaper establishments and other institutions.

Tilak and Mrs. Besant endeavoured to strengthen the
support of the democrats in England, who claimed to be
fighting against autocracy, and of countries allied to Britain.
Behind this effort were the masses of India on the one side,
and the Indian _bourgeoisie_ who were gaining self-confidence,
on the other. Thus, under the leadership of the 'extremists'
who had been pushed out of the Congress a decade earlier,
India witnessed a political urge with a clear aim and perspective.

A word about the name of this movement and the organization.
As we have seen earlier, the aim of the movement
as formulated first by the 'extremists' under Tilak and subsequently
accepted by the Congress was "_Swaraj_". There is
a history behind the selection of the term "_Home Rule_" in
place of _Swaraj_. It was the time when the people of
Ireland were engaged in a fierce battle. The central slogan
of that struggle was "_Home Rule_ for Ireland". Its echo
was heard in India. The term "_Home Rule_" indicated that
the Indian people were fighting for the same objective for
which the Irish people were fighting. There is also an indication
that the methods of struggle used in Ireland would be
employed in India too. The _Home Rule_ agitation in Ireland
in 1916 assumed the nature of the revolutionary struggle
which was well known as the '_Easter Revolt_'. Thousands of
Indians inspired by that struggle rallied under the banner of
the "_Home Rule League_". India had never witnessed such
a widespread mass movement before.

## _ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS_

The emergence and growth of the _Home Rule_ movement
angered the British rulers. They decided to take repressive
actions against the organizers of this movement as they did
against those who started similar movements earlier. In
particular, actions were taken again against Tilak and Mrs.
Besant.

Though the Bombay High Court set aside the government's
demand of security for good behaviour served on
Tilak, the government prohibited his entry into certain provinces.
Similar ban orders were issued against other leaders like
Bipin Chandra Pal. Mrs. Besant was interned along with
her two colleagues.

None of these actions, however, weakened the movement.
On the contrary, these actions only helped to
strengthen the loyalty of the people to this movement and
their opposition to the government. Protesting against these
actions, Subramonia Iyer declared that he was prepared to
undergo punishment for standing firmly by the _Home Rule_
movement even if the government were to ban it. Following
the example set by him, nearly 2000 persons, among whom
were popular leaders, registered their protest. Protest meetings
were held all over the country.

In the background of the country-wide protest, the _All
India Congress Committee_ met and demanded the release of
Mrs. Besant and her colleagues. To back up this demand, it
elected her the president of the session.

As noted earlier, the _Muslim League_ was working independently
of both the _Home Rule League_ and the Congress.
But it participated in the protest against the suppression of
the _Home Rule_ movement. It was decided to start a peaceful
resistance struggle jointly by the Congress and the _Muslim
League_ to protest against repression.

Thus, the repression unleashed by the government to
destroy the organization formed to fight for _home rule_ gave
rise to a country-wide agitation for the release of its leaders.
The leaders of the movement earned the regard and respect
of millions and turned out to be more dangerous to the rulers.

Realizing the danger involved in the agitation and also
the futility of repressive actions, the ruling circles of both
India and England began to make fresh moves to appease
at least the 'moderate' section, if not the entire Indian political
leadership.

Early in 1917, Austin Chamberlain, Secretary of State for
India, emphasized the need to grant wider powers to Indians.
Critically examining the _administrative reforms_ proposals
submitted by the Viceroy, Chamberlain pointed to the need
to consider the change that had been brought about by the
world war and to the "objectives of independence and
national sovereignty" for which the _Allied Powers_ were
fighting. In particular, he exhorted the British rulers to
consider the Russian (February) Revolution, the enthusiastic
welcome it had received in Europe and America and its
impact on Indian public opinion as well as on the attitude of
the British towards the _Indian problem_ and to take strong
and courageous steps to meet Indian demands. It is clear
that it was not the internal situations alone that led Chamberlain
to take this stance.

This also makes it clear that even the British rulers were
convinced of the correctness of the political evaluation
expressed in the statement that "_England's need is India's
opportunity_". Not only that the _Allied Powers_ had not
gained anything in the war, but, as the _Russian Revolution_
showed, cracks were getting wider in their ranks. In
the circumstances, alienating the Indian _bourgeoisie_ would be
detrimental to the imperial interests represented by them.
On the other hand, if they could be appeased, it would be
possible to collect enough men and material with their full
cooperation and fight the war more effectively. These were
the considerations that turned Chamberlain and other rulers
to the path of _administrative reforms_.

There was yet another development. In Mesopotamia,
the _Allied forces_ met with a miserable military defeat. The
commission appointed to probe into the reasons for the defeat
submitted its report in July 1917 attributing the defeat to the
mismanagement on the part of the Government of India in
the conduct of the war and to acts of corruption indulged in
by its officials.

The report created a big stir in England. The Government
of India and the Secretary of State for India came
under fierce attack in the Parliament. Montagu, then an
Under Secretary of State for India, attacked the government
in scathing terms:

>The government of India is too wooden,
too iron, too inelastic, too antediluvian to be of any use for
the modern purposes we have in view.[^08/3]

Chamberlain was
forced to resign as Secretary of State for India, and in his
place, Montagu himself was appointed. Within a month
Montagu made an important announcement in the Parliament:

>The policy of HM[^hm] Government, with which the
Government of India are in complete accord, is that of increasing
association of Indians in every branch of the administration
and the gradual development of self-governing
institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of
_responsible government_ in India as an integral part of the
British Empire.[^08/4]

[^08/3]: Tarachand, _op. cit_, Vol III, p. 461.

[^hm]: His/Her Majesty (Refering to the King/Queen of England)

[^08/4]: _Ibid_, p. 463.

The announcement, couched in a vague and ambiguous
language though, created the impression that the British
Government was now ready to recognize the content of the
terms "_Swaraj_" and "_Home Rule_". But Montagu stated
that the policy would be implemented in progressive stages,
the timing and content of which were to be determined by
the British and Indian governments "responsible for the
welfare and progress of India". He further stated that
what inspired them in taking this decision were the cooperation
they were getting from those who got new opportunities
and the confidence the Government had in the sense of
responsibility they were showing Montagu expressed the
hope that there would be plenty of opportunities for a
public discussion on these proposals.

In other words, the next step towards _administrative
reforms_ would come only if the British rulers became
convinced that Indians were using the powers granted to
them "to the satisfaction" of the rulers. The idea conveyed
to the Indian leaders was that they could hope to reach the
goal of _Home Rule_ step by step only if they worked out the
reforms to the satisfaction of the authorities. This did not
satisfy the leaders of the _Home Rule_ movement. They demanded
a deadline for granting _Home Rule_. Presiding over the
Congress session, Annie Besant suggested _Home Rule_ before 1923.

The reaction of the 'moderates' was different. They
warmly welcomed Montagu's announcement characterizing
it the "_Magna Carta_" of India. They tried to keep away
the 'extremists' as far as possible, as they had done earlier at
the Surat session of the Congress. They also tried their
best to prevent installation of Mrs. Besant as the president
of the Congress in the same way as they did earlier in the
case of Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai. Only that they failed
in their attempt this time due to the changed political climate
in the country. There was a clear indication of another split
in the Congress which had been reunited just a year ago at
Lucknow.

There were also certain other developments following
Montagu's announcement. One concerns the claims made
by the Sikhs in Punjab and the _non-Brahmins_ in South India.
Since the demands put forth by the _Muslim League_ had
already been accepted in the proposals for _administrative
reforms_ formulated at Lucknow, no fresh demands were made
this time on behalf of the Muslims. The Sikhs demanded the
right to communal representation through separate electoral
constituencies similar to that granted to the Muslims. _non-Brahmins_
also demanded separate representation or through
reservation in general constituencies.

A more dangerous development that took place was the
organized opposition of the ICS[^ics] and other service personnel,
both serving and retired. No organized movement of
this magnitude had been carried out by the British officials
or non-officials in India since the earlier agitation against
Ilbert Bill. Now, with Montagu's announcement of reforms,
they started organizing themselves on the apprehension of
losing all the privileges they had hitherto been enjoying.
They also organized communities like the Anglo-Indians and
Christians and encouraged organized agitations of the native
princes on the plea that they had the right to protect their
own interests.

It was in this background that Lord Montagu visited
India with the stated purpose of meeting the representatives
of the various political parties and organizations and giving
a concrete shape to the proposed reforms by ascertaining
their opinions. But, in effect, this led to the weakening of
the _Home Rule_ movement by making the different sections
and organizations take stands mutually opposed to each other.
Just like utilizing the Muslim community and its political
organization, the _Muslim League_, against the _Swaraj_ movement
immediately before the _Minto-Morley reforms_, so
Montagu's visit to India turned out to be instrumental in
providing opportunities to organize communities like the
Sikhs, _non-Brahmins_, Christians and Anglo-Indians and uniting
them with the native princes and official and non-official
Englishmen.

Meanwhile, the war began to turn in favour of England.
By the middle of 1918, Germany began to weaken, while
the _Allied Powers_ began to gain strength owing to the economic
assistance received from the United States, compelling
Germany to surrender in November 1918. Lord Montagu
wrote in his diary in February 1918: "I have kept India
quiet for six months at a critical period of the war", adding
that Indian politicians had nothing but his visit to think about
at that time.[^08/5]

[^08/5]: _Ibid_, p. 464.

The change favourable to England came not long after
Montagu wrote this note in his diary. India's assistance,
which Montagu had considered essential when he made his
announcement, was not considered that important now in
the changed circumstances. This was reflected in the new
_administrative reforms_ proposal known as the _Montagu-Chelmsford
Report_.

As we had noticed earlier, the meaning of the slogans
"_Swaraj_" and "_Home Rule_" was that India should get the
full right to _self-government_, at least by stages, of the same
nature as the Dominions of Canada and Australia. The
_Montagu-Chelmsford Report_ was a total rejection of this
demand. The Report made it clear that the concept of
_self-government_ referred to earlier in Montagu's announcement
could be made applicable only in the case of local bodies
like municipalities. Even at that level, there would be a few
nominated members along with the elected ones. That is to
say, they would not be fully elected bodies.

At the provincial level, there would be a legislative assembly
with a majority of elected members. But, even there,
there would be a number of nominated members. Furthermore,
the administration would be in the hands of the Governor
and a two-member Executive Council. The main feature
of the new "reforms" was that one of the two members of
the Executive Council would be an Indian and that certain
unimportant portfolios would be assigned to ministers from
among the elected members of the assembly. But, the
Governor had the right to change the decisions taken by the
ministers in relation to their respective portfolios. It was
clear that since all the important portfolios were reserved
for the Governor and his Executive Council and since the
Governor had the right to interfere with matters within the
powers of the ministers, these reforms did not even touch
the fringe of the demand raised by the _Home Rule_ movement.

In the case of the Central Government, the matter was
still worse. There, the Governor-General and his Executive
Council would exercise all the powers. The reforms at the
central level pertained only to an increase in the number of
elected members in the legislature and the extended right of
members to ask questions. Another feature of the _Montagu-Chelmsford
Report_ was that it gave rise to a new force
directly opposing the developing political movement in the
country. It contained the proposal to form a new body --- the
_Chamber of Princes_ --- designed to fight to protect the vested
interests of the princes.

In brief, Montagu returned to England after formulating
proposals that would render lifeless even the announcement
that he was compelled to make in the British Parliament in
August 1917 due to the international pressure created in the
atmosphere of the First World War.

## TOWARDS SPLIT AGAIN

The election of Annie Besant as the president of the
Congress clearly showed that the 'moderates' and 'extremists'
in the Congress once again started working unitedly. But the
contradiction between the two groups started becoming
sharper within months after the Congress session held under
Mrs. Besant's presidentship. The immediate reason for this
was the _Montagu-Chelmsford proposals_. The difference of
opinion that existed between the 'moderates' who cheerfully
welcomed the proposals and the 'extremists' who declared
them totally unacceptable led the organization towards a
split.

But this time, unlike the developments a decade earlier,
the differences did not lead to the expulsion of the 'extremists'
from the Congress. In fact, the 'moderates' left the Congress
and started a separate organization, called the _Liberal
Federation_.

Its beginning was in Bengal, and that too, before the
publication of the _Montagu-Chelmsford report_. The 'moderates'
in Bengal formed a new organization, the _National
Liberal League_, and issued a statement:

>We must be
prepared to give our accord and support to the positive side
of the scheme, if it takes us a long way to our objective. On
the contrary, if it falls short of our expectations, we must
express our disappointment and protest against it.

The Bengal radicals who met after the publication of
the _Montagu-Chelmsford report_, on the other hand, declared
that the proposals for reforms were disappointing and
unsatisfactory and that it would not lead to a _responsible
government_. These conflicting opinions expressed by the
'moderates' in Bengal before the publication of the report and
by the radicals immediately after it gave rise to three main
trends of opinion at the all-India level.

The first one was that of the 'moderates' who regarded
that the reforms were in the right direction and constituted
"a real and substantial step towards the progressive
realisation of _responsible government_". The second was that
of the leftist section which maintained that basically and in
details they were totally wrong and were beyond improvement.
The third trend which was in between these two, held
that the proposals were unsatisfactory, and argued for demanding
substantial changes, instead of totally rejecting them.

Even among the leader of the _Home Rule_ movement,
there were people holding the latter two views. For instance,
Tilak, one of the two most eminent leaders of the movement,
was the powerful sponsor of the policy of "_responsive
cooperation_", which became well known later in Indian politics.
That is, the nationalists must extend their cooperation
to the government commensurate with the cooperation
extended by the government to the Indian nationalist leaders
working with the objective of _Swaraj_ or _Home Rule_.

Mrs. Annie Besant, Tilak's comrade-in-arms in the
_Home Rule_ movement, on the other hand, advocated a
policy of _unconditional cooperation_. Thus, both Tilak and
Mrs. Besant were against _non-cooperation_.

Yet the 'moderates' started their moves against the
leaders of the _Home Rule_ movement alleging that Tilak,
Mrs. Besant and other leaders and ranks of the _Home Rule_
movement were on the side of _non-cooperation_. They further
alleged that the 'extremists' who occupied official positions in
the Congress following the restoration of unity were striving
to lead the organization along the path of _non-cooperation_.
In fact, it was on this ground that the 'moderate' leaders
formed the _Liberal Federation_.

The 'extremist' section holding official positions in the
Congress, in fact, adopted such an attitude as would avoid
another split in the organization. They decided to convene a
special session of the Congress in Bombay to resolve the
differences that existed between the two groups and evolve
a line generally acceptable to all sections in the Congress.
They hoped that the conference with the participation of
both the groups would help to arrive at a joint decision based
on mutual accommodation. The 'moderates', however, did not
participate in the conference. Instead, they held their own
conference in Calcutta and formed the _Liberal Federation_,
as mentioned above.

It must be specifically mentioned that, though separate
conferences were held, one in Bombay and the other in
Calcutta, the policy adopted in both of them on the reforms
proposals was, by and large, the same. One pointed to the
specific drawbacks in the proposals and suggested specific
modifications with a preface that the reforms proposals were
acceptable to them. The Congress led by the 'extremists'
also made the same critique and suggestions. But unlike the
'moderates', they prefaced their resolution with the statement
that the proposals were totally disappointing. This was the
difference between the two.

It would, however, be wrong to suggest that the difference
was only in terminology. Behind the difference in terminology,
there was a fundamental difference in regard to policy
and approach. Neither the 'moderates' like Surendranath
Banerji nor the 'extremists' like Tilak and Mrs. Besant had any
doubt on the question of accepting whatever was offered as
a means to demand more. The difference between the two
was over the question of how to get more. The 'extremists'
proposed to enter the legislatures and such other forums in
order to use them as a platform to oppose the rulers on every
occasion. They believed this to be the only way to win
_Swaraj_ or _Home Rule_. The 'moderates', on the other hand,
characterized this approach as negative and suggested functioning
in a more "constructive and constitutional" manner.

As indicated earlier, despite the difference in the means,
the goal of both the groups was the same. Both groups
wanted the self-governing of the provinces stipulated in the
reforms proposal to be widened with more departments
transferred to the elected ministers. Both wanted no delay
in establishing _responsible government_ at the Centre about
which the reforms proposal was silent. That is, they wanted
at least some departments at the Centre to be transferred to
the elected members as in the case of the provinces. They
also wanted that at least half of the official members of the
Executive Councils should be Indians both at the Centre and
the provinces, in addition to the elected ministers.

In brief, both the 'moderates' and the 'extremists' were
unanimous in the opinion that as a first step towards _Swaraj_
or _Home Rule_, the elected representation of the people at
the Centre and provinces must get more powers than what
was envisaged in the _Montagu-Chelmsford proposals_.

The identity of views with regard to the basic objective as
well as to the reforms proposals to be implemented immediately,
on the one hand, and the differences of opinion with
regard to the means to be adopted to achieve this aim, on
the other, went to prove that the strength of the (_bourgeois_)
class which both the 'moderates' and 'extremists' equally represented,
was growing rapidly.

It may be recalled that when the _bourgeoisie_ first emerged
as a political force, they adopted the means of declaring
absolute loyalty to the British rule and of making humble
representations to secure petty demands. Now they were
not satisfied with petty immediate demands as was the case
in the earlier days. The Indian _bourgeoisie_ had now
transformed itself into a class confident of its own strength to
get from the British _self-government_ for India in the sense of
full control of elected representatives over the internal administration,
remaining an integral part of the British Empire
though, and confident of getting the support of the peoples
and governments of the capitalist countries like the USA
and France in acquiring this right.

The problem was how to use this strength. The
_bourgeoisie_ as a class knew that it was impracticable to obtain
arms and arms training from foreign powers and create a
revolutionary army to smash the British rule in the way the
revolutionaries were trying to do before and during the war.
For that reason, one section of the _bourgeoisie_ represented
by the 'moderates' believed that the practical approach was to
maintain, as before, friendly relations with the rulers and
cooperate with them fully, although the purpose was to win
the new objective as well as the immediate demands. The
other section represented by the 'extremists', on the other
hand, believed that to achieve these same aims, it was necessary
to organize agitations to exert pressure on the rulers,
while adopting at the same time an approach of friendship
and cooperation towards them.

What led to the difference of opinion was Tilak's slogan
of "_conditional cooperation_." This is important. The very
term "_conditional cooperation_" makes it clear that the allegation
of the 'moderates' that Tilak and his comrades were
arguing for complete _non-cooperation_ was baseless. Let us
note in passing that this was what led later to the conflict
between the 'extremists' under Tilak's leadership and the _Congressmen_
led by Gandhi.

If it was the word "conditional" in the term "_conditional
cooperation_" that was opposed by the 'moderates' as well as
the co-workers of Tilak like Mrs. Besent, with the beginning
of the Gandhian period, the opposition came to the second
word of the term, namely, "cooperation". That is, if in the
earlier stages, the adversaries of Tilak blamed him for the
approach of _unconditional cooperation_, the followers of
Gandhi opposed his approach of cooperation with the government
even if it was conditional.

A fact that can be called an 'irony of history' must be
specifically mentioned here. Among those who were opposed
to the "conditional" part of "_conditional cooperation_"
included Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Later on, the
same Gandhi became a powerful opponent of the second
part of the term, namely, "cooperation". Since Tilak had
died at the beginning of the second stage, there was no
occasion for a direct confrontation between him and
Gandhi. It is certainly an irony of history that Gandhi who
adopted the approach of Annie Besant and the 'moderates' in
opposing "conditions" to cooperation, should become the
leader of the _Non-cooperation_ Movement within months and
that the followers of Tilak should oppose, at least partially,
the _Non-cooperation_ Movement led by Gandhi, in consonance
with their line of "_conditional cooperation_".

Tilak himself had realized during the last days of his
life that things were moving in that direction. In April 1920 --- four months before his demise --- Tilak formed a new
organization, the _Congress Democratic Party_. The manifesto
published in the name of the new party proposed to
participate in the ensuing elections according to the new
reforms and bring under the control of the Congress all
provincial legislatures and to use these positions to "offer
cooperation or resort to constitutional opposition, whichever
may be expedient and best calculated to give effect to the
popular will."

It is significant that Tilak now felt it necessary to form
a party of his own to oppose the growing trend of _non-cooperation_
in the Congress, just as he had in the earlier days,
formed a party of the 'extremists' to oppose the frigid policy
then followed by the 'moderates'.

Tilak's decision to form another organization to oppose
from within the Congress the policy of _non-cooperation_ and
to fight for the policy of "_conditional cooperation_" at a time
when the old 'moderates' were forming their organization, the
_Liberal Federation_, outside the Congress marked a new stage
in the history of the freedom movement and the leading role
of the _bourgeoisie_ in it. While protecting its own class interest,
the _bourgeoisie_ has a political aim of rallying the entire
people behind it. With regard to _Swaraj_ or _Home Rule_,
there is no difference between the 'moderates' and the 'extremists';
the entire _bourgeoisie_ is one for it. But it had not
yet been able to create unanimity on the question of how to
work towards achieving that national objective. Therefore,
the _bourgeoisie_ itself had now come to the scene to form
different organizations with different means to achieve the
common objective.

Like Naoroji and Gokhale in the earlier period, Tilak,
Lala Lajpat Rai and Mrs. Besant were those who came to
the forefront and played their respective roles at the various
stages of the development of the same class having the same
objective, though differing on the question of achieving this
objective. In addition to them, now a towering personality
had come to the scene --- Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.
This is the meaning of the differences of opinion over the
term "_conditional cooperation_" and the _Congress Democratic
Party_ formed by Tilak in its background.
