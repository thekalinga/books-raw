# Author's Preface

Originally written in Malayalam and serialized in the
_Deshabhimani Daily_, this book was brought out first in four
volumes in 1977. A second edition in single volume appeared
subsequently. I am glad that through the efforts of Sarvashri
BB Nayar, KT Zacharias, PK Sivadas and
CP Narayanan who translated it into English, this
edition is now coming out. My thanks are due to the four
translators as well as to Shri Atmanand Bhat and Dr.
KMN Menon who edited and prepared the matter for
the press and to Smt. MS Aleyamma who prepared the
Index. It was good of the Social Scientist Press at Trivandrum
who undertook the job of printing and publishing the
book.

As the reader will see, the volume ends with 15th August 1947. The last few chapters narrate the story of Indian
partition creating the two new states of Indian Union and
Pakistan. This in its turn culminated in the most extensive
slaughter of human beings and destruction of property. The
joyous occasion of the victorious end of _freedom struggle_
in other words ended in the biggest tragedy in human history.

Over two decades before I started the serial articles
which were subsequently collected and brought out in book
form, I had covered almost the same ground in my review
of Tendulkar's eight-volume biography of _Mahatma Gandhi_.
Originally written for and serialized in the _New Age_
Monthly, they were brought together in a volume, entitled
_The Mahatma and the Ism_. Confining itself to a review of
the _Mahatma_'s life, that volume traced the evolution and
final collapse of Gandhism as a philosophy and a programme
of political action. That volume ends as the same note
as the last few chapters of the present volume. The only
difference is that this is not confined, as the _Mahatma_ was,
to the evolution of Gandhism. This deals with _bourgeois_
nationalism as a whole and, of course, includes the philosophy
and political programme of Gandhism. The two volumes
may therefore be considered companion volumes, though
this is written with a much broader canvas.

In between the publication of _The Mahatma and the Ism_
and the first edition of this volume in Malayalam, a furious
debate raged in the undivided _Communist Party of India_ in
which I was naturally an active participant. Among the
various notes and articles produced for nearly a decade for
purposes of inner-party discussion, I also wrote a fairly large
volume under the title _Economics and Politics of India's Socialist
Pattern_. This was a major attempt for my own self-education
and for discussions among the members and friends of the
Party on various problems connected with the class character
and policies of the Congress Government which took over
the reins of administration from the British in 1947.

Thus being the basic character of that volume, it naturally
contained many things which, after clarification of
ideas which led to the formation of the _Communist Party
of India_ (Marxist), I found no more valid. I therefore rejected
the suggestions made by friends that a second edition of that
volume be brought out. The material contained in the book,
however, was used in writing two smaller volumes brought out
in the 1970s. _Indian Planning in Crisis_ was the title of one and
_Conflicts and Crisis_ was of the second. The former dealt with
the development of the economic crisis of the post-Independence
years and the latter bringing up-to-date the political
crisis which, in fact, had first made its appearance in 1947.
The two smaller volumes thus constituted a new edition of
the bigger _Economic and Political Crisis. of Socialist Pattern_.
They contained as sharp a critique of the economic and
political policies of the Indian _bourgeoisie_ after it became the
ruling party as the earlier published volume on the _Mahatma_
and the present volume on the _Freedom Struggle_ are of the
_bourgeoisie_'s role before 1947.

The critique of the philosophy and plan of political
action of the Indian _bourgeoisie_ which, under the charismatic
personality of _Mahatma Gandhi_, stood at the head of the
freedom movement, contained in the four volumes referred
to above is of topical importance today. The leadership of
the ruling Congress Party organized last year on a mass scale
the celebration of the Centenary of that organization. The
pronouncement made on that occasion in December 1985
by the Prime Minister who is also the President of the Congress (I) indicates the deep crisis which has engulfed that
party today. While taking pride in the centenary of Congress
development, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi played another
role --- a severe critique of the doings of the party, its prominent
leaders and governments headed by them. Did he
himself or any other top-ranking leader of that party care
to consider why the Congress which stood at the head of
_freedom struggle_ for 62 years since its formation came to
such a pass during the next 38 years that the President himself
has to take up the job of openly criticizing it?

The answer will be found in the three sections in the
last chapter, titled 'The Scheme of Partition', 'The Surgical
Operation', and 'Leaders of _Freedom Struggle_ in Power'.
The Mountbatten plan which was the culmination of the
prolonged negotiations undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi and
other Congress leaders contained within itself the seeds of
all that was painful and humiliating for many Congress
leaders including _Mahatma Gandhi_. That was the bitter
fruit of the astute strategy and tactics elaborated by the _bourgeois_
leadership under Mahatma Gandhi --- the strategy and
tactics of _mass action for negotiations with the British_. It was
this that enabled the British rulers to _Quit India_ as demanded
by the Congress but after performing a cruel surgical
Operation which brought into being two hostile States.

One argument likely to be advanced in this context is
that there is no use of crying over the split milk; the point is,
it may be urged, to deal with the present and the future.
But are the two things --- review of the past, deciding the
present and planning the future --- so opposed to each other?
I would, in fact, humbly plead that the economic and political
crisis through which the country has been passing for nearly 39 years and is passing today should be traced to the past
--- the class character of the _bourgeois leadership_ which stood at
the head of the freedom movement. As a matter of fact, the
Communist movement in the country,which, of course, was too
weak taking the country as a whole, had pointed out as early as
in the years of the _Quit India Struggle_ that the freedom won
on the basis of bargaining with the rulers would not take the
country anywhere. After the country attained Independence,
the undivided _Communist Party_ to begin with, and the
CPI (M) subsequently, persisted in projecting such general
policies as alternatives to the policies of the _bourgeoisie_
(ruling as well as Opposition _bourgeois_ parties).
The line of criticism made by the undivided Party to
begin with, and by the CPI (M) later, has been explained
in the two volumes which I wrote in the 1970s --- _Indian Planning
in Crisis_ and _Conflicts and Crisis_. I hope that the story
narrated in this volume will give the readers a better idea
of the content of the criticism made in the two volumes.
