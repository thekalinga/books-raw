# TENSIONS DURING THE WAR

## IMPACT OF THE '_BLITZKRIEG_'

During the summer of 1940, certain developments took
place in Europe which significantly affected the political
future of India, Europe and the world. The strategy adopted
originally by Britain and France was to afford all facilities to
Hitler to destroy the Soviet Union, the sworn enemy of
_Capitalism_ and imperialist domination. They expected that
in the event of a German invasion of Poland, the Soviet Union
would go to the defence of Poland, which would eventually
result in a war between Germany and the Soviet Union.
But the German-Soviet _no-war pact_ frustrated the design of
Britain and France. It made possible for Hitler to turn to
the west after conquering Poland. Although Britain and
France declared war on Germany as allies of Poland, in the
absence of an alliance with the Soviet Union, they were not
in a position to take military actions against Germany.
Hitler did not turn towards the Western European countries,
either. Thus, a situation of a 'farcical war' prevailed in Europe
during the last months of 1939 and initial months of 1940.

By summer the situation changed. The _Nazi_ forces
entered Western Europe and conquered the West European
countries including France, within about a month and half.
This was known as the '_Blitzkrieg_'. This transition from
the 'farcical war' to the '_Blitzkrieg_' was of great importance
in world politics. France and Holland which had been
trampling underfoot numerous countries in Asia and Africa
collapsed under the _Nazi_ attack. London and other cities of
Great Britain, another colonial power, received heavy doses of
bombardment. The British government and people feared that
the _Nazi_ forces might conquer the island under the cover of
the air attack.

This ignominious defeat of Britain and France helped
_anti-imperialist_ sentiments in the colonial countries including
India to soar. The revolutionaries in Indo-China, Philippines,
Malaya and other countries made conscious and organized
efforts to utilize the crisis of the ruling classes in the imperial
countries to strengthen the independence struggle in their
own countries. It was in this situation that the _Workers Party
of Vietnam_, which had made its indelible mark in world
history, and its leaders like Ho Chi Minh, Gen. Giap and
Le Duan prepared themselves for their epic battle for liberation
from the French colonial domination. In other SouthEast
Asian countries in which _Marxist-Leninist_ parties were
not well organized, or lacked mass base, war-time revolutionary
movements later became weak or even disintegrated.

In India, the _Marxist-Leninist_ party was weak. Besides,
the colonial government in India did not collapse as it happened
in many South-East Asian countries. Above all, a
_bourgeois_ national leadership capable of effectively using --- to
control --- the _anti-imperialist_ feelings of the people had
been existing in India. It was a leadership which stood in the
forefront of the fighting masses and adept in utilizing the
popular force for negotiating with the imperialist rulers. As
a continuation of this strategy, the Congress leadership
utilized the discomfiture of the British rulers following the
'_Blitzkrieg_' to open another round of negotiation with the
rulers. They maintained the hope that Britain, whose future
was in danger like other allied countries in Europe would be
prepared to show concessions if the Congress was ready to
extend cooperation which they needed in order to face the
danger to their own country. This led to serious differences
of opinion within the Congress leadership. Before considering
the details of these differences, it is necessary to refer in brief
to the impact of the '_Blitzkrieg_' on the internal politics of
Britain.

As noted earlier, Neville Chamberlain, the author of the
notorious policy of appeasement towards Hitler, was the
Prime Minister of Britain when the war broke out. There
was a strong feeling among the ruling classes of Britain that
the German-Soviet pact was a result of the failure of this
policy. This feeling got strengthened with the beginning of
the '_Blitzkrieg_' as a result of which the Chamberlain government
was replaced by a government headed by Winston
Churchill who was known to be a hard anti-_Nazi_. Although
Churchill was known to have had no sympathy towards the
Indian national movement, many 'friends' of India were in
his cabinet.

Many among the Congress leaders thought that if India
assured her assistance and cooperation to the British when
they were facing a dangerous situation, they would be compelled
to grant, in return, the demands which the Congress
had been raising continually. Gandhi's close disciples like
Rajagopalachari and Sardar Patel were prominent among
the spokesmen of this view. But Gandhi did not agree with
this. Serious differences arose within the leadership now as
ever before. A majority in the _Working Committee_ was against
Gandhi's opinion. The _Working Committee_ adopted a
form of struggle which was opposed to what Gandhi was
envisaging

As we have seen earlier, a similar situation arose immediately
after the war broke out, in which a majority in the
Working Committee was against the opinion of Gandhi. Then
Gandhi was holding the view that India should offer
unconditional assistance to Britain when she was facing an
extremely difficult situation. However, Nehru was of the
opinion that since Britain had been taking a rigid attitude
towards the national movement in India and other British
colonies, India could not cooperate with her in her war efforts
unless she relaxed this rigid attitude. A majority of the _Working
Committee_ agreed with Nehru, leading to the resignation
of Rajendra Prasad from the Congress presidentship in favour
of Nehru. Almost a similar situation prevailed in the days
following the '_Blitzkrieg_'. Once again the majority opinion
in the _Working Committee_ was against Gandhi's views.

It must be specifically mentioned here that when Gandhi
advocated unconditional assistance to the British in the days
immediately after the outbreak of the war, he did it subject
to a crucial condition. Gandhi was of the opinion that India
should not offer the kind of assistance which would go
against his creed of _non-violence_. He even advised the Briton
"to fight _Nazism_ without arms or, if... to retain the military
terminology, with _non-violent_ arms". Obviously, Gandhi
could not agree to the offer of assistance to the British, including
military service, which would involve violence. He
continued to hold the same view even after the beginning of
the "_Blitzkrieg_."

Interestingly, the dispute now was not over whether assistance should be offered to Britain at all as it
was the case earlier in the beginning of the war, but over the
kind of assistance, assistance involving violence or _non-violence_.
The majority in the _Working Committee_ supported
the views of Rajagopalachari and Sardar Patel, while a
minority remained with Gandhi who adhered to the '_non-violent_
assistance'. Although Nehru disagreed with the
majority, he refused to stand with Gandhi. On the resolution
adopted by the _Working Committee_ with majority votes,
Gandhi said:

>Rajaji was the framer of the resolution. He was as certain
of his position as I was of mine. His persistence and
courage and utter humility brought him converts. Sardar
Patel was his greatest prize.[^24/1]

[^24/1]: D. G. Tendulkar, _Mahatma_, Vol. 5, p. 299.

Although there was a sharp difference of opinion on
the attitude towards the British rulers and their war efforts,
every one in the Congress leadership was in agreement on
the objective of the Congress that the British rulers must
immediately declare their readiness to constitute a _constituent
assembly_ for India with the representatives of the
Indians as soon as the termination of the war and in the
meantime to introduce the necessary administrative changes
at the Centre to include Indian people's representatives in it
immediately.

The resolution adopted by the _Working Committee_ was
later confirmed by the _AICC_ making one more effort to bargain
with the British authorities.

## VINOBA, NEHRU, AND BOSE

Events did not develop as Rajagopalachari, Patel and
the majority in the _Working Committee_ expected. The assistance
offered by the Congress to the British war efforts did
not evoke the anticipated response in the rulers. They
refused to concede the demands raised by the Congress in
return for its offer of assistance. Although the Congress
leaders and the spokesmen of the government continued to
communicate with each other through public statements, the
gulf that existed between them remained as wide as ever.

The Congress demand was that the necessary changes
be made in the set-up of the Central government and in its
functioning so that India too might enjoy in effect the
_Dominion Status_ like many other former colonies. The
rulers, on the other hand, were not prepared to introduce any
change in the existing set-up beyond including the representatives
of the Congress and other organizations in the _Central
Executive Council_. Nor were they prepared to offer any
assurance as to the future constitution of India after the termination
of the war. In other words, the new situation created
by the '_Blitzkrieg_' did not bring any change in the rulers.

The government, on the contrary, was taking more
repressive actions against the Congress and other _anti-imperialist_
organizations. Although most of the top Congress
leaders, except Bose, were left free, leaders at the lower
levels were arrested and put behind the bars. In the provinces,
various charges were framed against many. Those who
were in jails had to suffer a lot. In addition to prohibiting
public meetings and curtailing the freedom of the press and
other mass media under the existing law, an emergency law
banning volunteer organizations was enacted. These repressive
actions caused deep anguish among the _Congressmen_
and the people.

In this background the Congress resolution offering
assistance to the government's war efforts lost its relevance.
The entire scheme to exert pressure on the rulers to
get the demands conceded through negotiations collapsed.
The majority of the _Working Committee_ members including
Rajagopalachri and Patel became convinced that a struggle
was the only way out. They appealed to Gandhi to resume
the leadership of the Congress.

Gandhi was prepared to resume the leadership of the
Congress only on his own terms. He explicitly stated that he
was not prepared to load a struggle which deviated from the
path of _non-violence_; the struggle which he would launch
would be subject strictly to the conditions and restrictions he
would place on it. The majority in the _Working Committee_,
on the other hand, was prepared to accept any condition put
forward by Gandhi. Thus, within hardly two months of taking
the decision to offer cooperation to the war efforts of Britain
rejecting Gandhi's _non-violent_ path, the _AICC_ now came
forward to launch a _non-violent_ _satyagraha_ and to appoint
Gandhi its commander-in-chief.

The _AICC_ took this decision in the middle of September 1940. Even before this decision was taken, mass struggles
of various forms were going on throughout the country. In
many important cities and industrial centres workers struck
work and organized processions in which tens of thousands of
workers and other poor and middle class people participated.
The _Communist Party_ and other leftist organizations were
in the forefront of giving these mass struggles an organized
leadership and in organizing anti-war propaganda. A section
of the ordinary _Congressmen_ and Congress committees cooperated
with them in these activities. It may be noted, for
example, that the _Kerala Provincial Congress Committee_
which was then under the leadership of the leftists gave a
call to organize anti-war demonstrations. The _Protest Day_
observation on 15th September led to a clash between the
demonstrators and the police. Gandhi and other Congress
leaders were disturbed over the growth of this tendency. The
problem before them was how to curb such 'violent' activities
when discussions were progressing on the launching of a struggle
under Gandhi's leadership. The problem of how to start
a 'strictly controlled struggle' was haunting them. After prolonged
discussions it was made clear that a mass struggle of
the type launched in 1930 and 1932 was not being visualized
now. It would be _individual satyagraha_ as in 1933. But as distinct
from the 1933 _satyagraha_, only those whom Gandhi believed
to have full faith in Gandhian philosophy and way of life
would be chosen to offer _satyagraha_. Gandhi, as long as he remained
outside the jail, himself will decide on the individuals
to offer _satyagraha_ one after the other. Strict instructions were
given out that except those chosen by Gandhi, no one should
violate the laws and rules framed by the government.

As in the case of the form of the struggle, Gandhi was also
particular about the issues to be raised through the struggle.
It was not a struggle for _Full Independence_; nor was _Dominion
Status_ the object of the struggle. The protest against
dragging the Indian people to a war without their consent
also did not form the basis of the struggle. The purpose of
the struggle was to express opposition to war in general and
to protest against the denial of freedom to propagate this
opposition.

In order to make this clear, it is necessary to understand
Gandhi's theoretical attitude towards war. In an earlier
chapter we have seen that Gandhi had given active support
to Britain in her war efforts and that he was opposed to
Tilak's opinion that the cooperation offered to the British
should be subject to certain political conditions. We have
also seen just above that at the beginning as well as at the
latter stages of the Second World War, Gandhi maintained
the same attitude towards the war. Briefly, Gandhi had
been maintaining the uncompromising policy of giving _unconditional
cooperation_ to the British in war. But when
it became clear that the British rulers were not only rejecting
the offer of _conditional cooperation_ by the Congress
but also gagging the press and the people and suppressing
the Congress, he admitted that his policy of _unconditional
cooperation_ had ceased to be relevant. Consequently, he changed
to unconditional opposition to war and unconditional
right to campaign against war. Gandhi viewed the impending
struggle under his leadership as opposition to war and
to restrictions imposed during the war.

Gandhi was in search of a person to be appointed the
first _Satyagrahi_ in the _individual satyagraha_ which he was
going to launch. Finally, he found Vinoba Bhave who had
been devoted for long to the Gandhian _constructive programme_
of spinning and propagation of _Khadi_ and whom
hw considered to be the best qualified and able to carry out
the kind of _satyagraha_ he had in mind. Thus, Vinoba who
till then had been a relatively unknown person whose activities
had been confined to an _ashram_ in a village near Wardba
all of a sudden gained all-India fame.

The form of the _individual satyagraha_ started by Vinoba
is also noteworthy. He would move from place to place in a
village and openly state that he was against war and
exhort the people not do anything that would help the prousecution
of the war. If he were arrested by the police, he
would go to the jail; otherwise he would go to the next village
and repeat the same thing there and so on. Vinoba was finally
arrested only after offering _satyagraha_ in this manner in some
villages.

It must specifically be stated that this _satyagraha_ was
against all wars, no matter who conducted them. Gandhi and
his disciples found absolutely no distinction between Hitler
and his gang who conquered other countries and the people
in those countries who resisted the Hitlerite aggression to
defend own their country. This was evident from the letters
Gandhi had addressed separately to Hitler and the Britons.
Their approach towards the war was not the political approach
of forging unity of the democratic forces in India and
abroad against the fascist powers as envisaged in the official
resolutions of the Congress, but the ethical and moral approach
of the believers who opposed use of force of all forms.

Gandhi's opinion that Vinoba Bhave was best qualified
to start the _individual satyagraha_ with such an approach
towards war need not surprise anyone. But what was indeed
surprising was Gandhi's choice of the successor to Vinoba.

Gandhi's choice of the Second _Satyagrahi_ did not fall
on acclaimed Gandhian disciples like Rajendra Prasad and
Shankarrao Deo, but on Jawaharlal Nehru! Although Nehru
showed utmost personal loyalty to Gandhi and carried out in
a disciplined way the decisions of the Congress on Gandhian
lines, he was no firm believer of Gandhian ideologies. He
had the tradition of rendering moral and material assistance
to the peoples of Spain and China in their fight against the
fascist and militarist forces. He was opposed to the British
rulers not only because of their colonial domination of
India, but also because of the role they played in the growth
of the fascist powers in Europe. That was why he was also
opposed to Gandhi's policy of offering unconditional assistance
to Britain in the initial stages of the war as well as to
the proposal of Rajagopalachari and others to offer conditional
assistance to the British in their war efforts.

Now the question is how did Gandhi's choice of the
Second _Satyagrahi_ fall on Nehru who had always been
dealing with the issue only politically by considering the
general nature of the war and Britain's role in it. In order
to find an answer to this question, it is necessary to examine
closely both the agreements and differences between the ideological
approaches accepted by Gandhi and Nehru, and the
reality of class politics underlying these approaches. As
indicated above, Gandhi approached the war from moral
and religious points of view. Nehru, on the other hand,
looked upon the war not in general terms, but a specific war
fought between fascism which had become a danger to the
whole world on the one side and the chief imperialist powers
of Britain and France on the other, in which the latter were
deploying freely the men and materials of their colonies
including India. But both Gandhi and Nehru who thus
viewed the war from different angles had to safeguard the
interest of the same (_bourgeois_) class. The political content
of the approaches adopted by both was the intention to rally
the Indian people behind that class and to utilize their organized
force to bargain with the British rulers. Although the
bargaining was prolonged for about a year, they failed to
bring about a change in the attitude of the rulers. As a
result, the Congress was moving towards an inevitable
struggle. The entire Congress leadership wanted Nehru to
join Gandhi and Vinoba Bhave in this struggle, for it would
create the impression that the struggle was being conducted
unitedly by the Congress overcoming the differences of opinion
that had surfaced at the different stages after the outbreak
of the war. In addition, it would strengthen the pressure
tactics employed by Gandhi, Nehru, Rajagopalachari and
Patel in different forms.

There was another important fact which accords particular
mention. Soon after bearing that a _satyagraha_ was going to be
launched under Gandhi's leadership, Subhas Bose wrote to
Gandhi offering his services in carrying out the struggle
successfully. But Gandhi rejected the offer stating that his
differences with Bose were fundamental in nature. But even
before the war broke out, Gandhi was not prepared to trust
Bose who had been the victim of punitive measures by the
leadership for having raised a challenge against Gandhi and
other right-wing Congress leaders. Between Gandhi and Bose
there was only difference of opinion, whereas the bond of
mutual trust between Gandhi and Nehru was stronger than
the difference of opinion between them. Bose would not be
able to participate in a struggle led by Gandhi and subject
to the conditions set by him, On the contrary, like Vinoba
Bhave, Nehru would be able to function within the Gandhian
framework, no matter how broad were the basic differences
that existed between Gandhi and Nehru. These were the
considerations basic to the two decisions of Gandhi --- the
selection of Nehru as the Second _Satyagrahi_ and the rejection
of the offer of cooperation made by Bose.

## DISRUPTION OF THE LEFT MOVEMENT

The difference that had begun to appear in the left
movement before the outbreak of the war became acute in
the months following the outbreak of the war. The leftists as a
whole were opposed to the compromising attitude of the
right-wing leaders of the Congress. However, there were differences
among them on the question of how to draw the Congress
leadership to the struggles against the war and imperialist
domination. In this respect, the Communist and the
_Congress Socialists_ took an attitude which was distinct from
that adopted by Subhas Bose. The Communist and the
_Congress Socialists_ regarded that since the Congress had
a decisive role to play in rallying the people against imperialism
and war, it was the duty of the leftists to preserve the
organization and unity of the Congress. Bose and his colleagues,
on the other hand, did not mind even if the fight
against the compromising policy of the right-wing leaders
led to a split in the Congress.

There were differences of opinion between the Communists
and _Congress Socialists_ on the question of how to carry
out the activities to maintain unity in the Congress. The
latter were working on the expectation that the entire right-wing
leadership of the Congress could be drawn to the path
of struggles. For them Congress discipline was supreme.
Their policy was to struggle as strongly as possible inside
the Congress to make the leadership accept the path of
struggle and carry out the programme decided upon by the
Congress leadership.

The Communists, on the other hand, while working
within the Congress with a view to leading it along the path
of struggle, led the people independently in their agitations
and struggles. They played a significant role in mobilizing
workers and organizing strikes against price rise during the
first months of the war. Considering the class character of
the Congress, they did not expect its leadership to go along
the path of struggles. They believed that it was the task of
the left to organize and rally the people against the compromising
policy of the Congress leadership.

On account of the serious differences of opinion that
existed between Bose and the _Congress Socialists_ on the one
hand and the Communists on the other, an intense ideological
struggle took place among these three parties in the first
months of the war. Bose and the _Congress Socialists_ complained
that the Communists were trying to grow at the
expense of other left parties. In March 1940, the _Congress
Socialist Party_ announced the expulsion of Communists from
that Party. Although the Communists had no formal connection
with the _Forward Bloc_ the polemics between the
Communist and the _Forward Bloc_ was as sharp as that
between the Communists and the _Congress Socialists_.

One of the reasons for the rise of these differences of
opinion and competition between these parties was the fact
that they viewed the war differently. While two camps with
Britain aligned with one of the camps are engaged in a war
with each other, how to utilize the situation and gain independence? --- this
was the common concern of the right-wing
Congress leaders, _Congress Socialists_ and the _Forward Bloc_.
Utilizing the war-time situation, the right-wing Congress
leaders as well as the "left" Nehru tried to bargain to derive
maximum gain. That was why Nehru was chosen as the
Second _Satyagrahi_ to succeed Vinoba Bhave.

The _Congress Socialist Party_, and the _Forward Bloc_, on
the other hand, looked upon the war-time situation as an
opportunity to organize a revolution, instead of arriving at a
compromise with the British rulers. But they disagreed with
each other on the question of how to organize a revolution in
India utilizing the war-time situation. We have already noticed
the revolutionary perspective of the _Congress Socialist
Party_ _vis-à-vis_ its special relationship with the Congress.
Bose and the _Forward Bloc_ led by him were trying to organize
a revolution with the assistance of the foreign powers
opposed to Britain, defying the decisions of the Congress,
if necessary. In other words, the political approach adopted
by the _Forward Bloc_ was the continuation of the political
outlook of the revolutionaries who tried to organize a revolution
in India with the aid of certain imperialist countries
during the First World War on the basis of the logic of
"enemy's enemy, the friend."

When the Congress decided to launch the individual
_satyagraha_ in October 1940, the differences in outlook that
existed among the left parties came to the surface. The _Congress
Socialist Party_ never lagged behind the Communists in
formally opposing the method of Gandhian _satyagraha_. But
instead of rallying the masses against this _rightist_ policy of
the Congress, they tried to successfully carry on at least the
_satyagraha_ led by Gandhi.

As we have noted in the previous section, Bose had
offered his services to Gandhi for the successful conduct of
the _satyagraha_. When this offer was rejected by Gandhi, he
secretly left for Germany where he established contact with the
_Nazi_ rulers with a view to organizing a revolution in India with
their aid. For the same purpose, he later went to Japan and
organized the _Indian National Army_ and established the
_Azad Hind_ Government abroad. The _Congress Socialist Party_
did not approve of these exploits of Bose initially, but when
the right-wing Congress leadership started eulogizing Bose as
an epic hero after the 1942 struggle, the Socialists also followed
suit.

The attitude of the _Communist Party_ was quite different
from all this. The Party agreed that the war had brought
about a situation which was favourable for a revolution. But
they did not look upon the war in an abstract way as did all
others. They examined the character of the war and Britain's
role in it by making an objective evaluation of the international
background in which the war broke out, the _resultant_
class forces and their interrelationships, the complex political
problems arising out of this situation and so on. On the
basis of this examination, the _Communist Party_ came to the
political conclusion that the war being fought by Britain
and France against _Nazi_ Germany was not a real _anti-fascist_
war, but it was an imperialist war. The Soviet Union tried
its best to ensure that tbo Second World War as it broke out
would be a real _anti-fascist_ War. The Soviet leaders suggested
that the military strength of the capitalist countries like Britain
and France and that of the Soviet Union should be
consolidated and combined together to administer a deadly
blow at the forces of Hitler and Mussolini. The Communists
pointed out that the rulers of Britain who were prominent
among those who rejected the Soviet proposal and prepared
the ground for Hitler's aggressive war were donning the garb
of anti-fascism in order to consolidate their domination over
India and that it was the task of the revolutionaries to tear
away this _anti-fascist_ garb and expose the real character of
British imperialism. On this basis, the _Communist Party_
examined critically the policies and approaches of the right-wing
Congress leadership, the _Congress Socialist Party_ and
the _Forward Bloc_. The Party fundamentally disagreed with
the standpoint of the Congress leadership that India . was
sympathetic to the _anti-fascist_ war being fought by Britain
and France and that since the British rulers were not prepared
to effect any change in their attitude towards India, India was
unable to cooperate with the British. It pointed out that
Britain had been following an imperialist policy not only
towards India but also towards the _anti-fascist_ world politics.
This was another reason for the Party's fundamental opposition
to the compromising policy of the Congress.

Neither the _Congress Socialist Party_ nor the _Forward Bloc_
subscribed to this view. The leadership of the _Congress Socialist
Party_ was in the hands of those who had been following
the line of the world social democratic movement for which
anti-Communism and _anti-sovietism_ formed the core ideology.
Although the path of Socialist-Communist cooperation was
opened up in 1935--36 under the leadership of Jayaprakash
Narayan, the _Congress Socialist_ leadership transformed itself,
like all social democratic parties, into a group expressing antiCommunism
and _anti-Sovietism_. They refused to perceive
the role being played by the Soviet union in world politics
and denied the fact that the Second World War was caused
by the _anti-Soviet_ politics of the Chamberlain & co. They
Visualized an anti-war movement based on India-British relation
alone without exposing the pro-fascist role played by
British imperialism in the war and world politics. In other
words, having conceded the British claim that they were fighting
an _anti-fascist_ war, they simply opted for a revolutionary
struggle in place of bargaining with the British.

Bose and the _Forward Bloc_ went a step further. For
them the slogan of _anti-fascist_ war was irrelevant. They
thought it's possible to gain independence with the assistance
of Germany and Japan which were fighting a war against
India's national enemy --- the British imperialism. This idea
reached its full and practical form in 1942--43 when the
Soviet Union and Germany were engaged in a crucial war
against each other and Japan had reached the door-steps of
India after conquering all the South-East Asian countries.
In fact, it had already started appearing in its primary form
during 1940--41 when a general feeling had begun to spread
that _Nazi_ Germany was the force that was going to be helpful
in destroying the British domination. The people desired
a powerful struggle to develop even if it was under Gandhi's
leadership. It was in these circumstances that Bose offered
his co-operation to Gandhi in launching the _individual
satyagraha_ campaign. When this offer was turned down by
Gandhi, Bose left for Germany secretly in January 1941.

Thus, four main political parties and views appeared
actively on the scene: the Congress leadership striving to
bargain with Britain while making _anti-fascist_ declaration,
the _Congress Socialist_ leadership which, while pretending to
oppose the Congress, was in effect approving its policies, the
_Communist Party_ which was striving to expose the real
character of the British rulers by tearing away its _anti-fascist_
veil, and the _Forward Bloc_ which was striving to organize a
revolution in India with the assistance of the fascist powers.

A word about the _Royist group_ which was a component
of the _anti-imperialist_ front during 1935--39. It had changed
itself into a political party right from the outbreak of the
war offering full assistance to the British in their war efforts
losing the left character it had been maintaining.

## IMPACT OF THE SOVIET-GERMAN WAR

The _Nazi_ military attack on the Soviet Union which
began on 22nd June 1941 brought about a fundamental
change in the relationship among the left parties and between
them and the Congress. It also affected the basic character
of war and the world politics. In this new development, each
party was compelled to re-examine its own political stand.

It need not be repeated here that the _Communist Party_,
as distinct from other parties, views war in the international
context in which it occurs. Communists in India, as elsewhere
in the world, evaluated the war in the background of the
sharpening contradiction between the decaying _World Capitalism_
and the growing Socialism --- the principal phenomenon
in world politics that emerged with the _October
Revolution_ in Russia. The Party's approach towards the
government and towards the political parties was consistent
with this evaluation.

This might sometimes create difficult problems for the
Communist Parties of some countries. The foreign policy
requirements for the existence and growth of the Soviet
Union, the only Socialist country in the world, might
often be incompatible with the internal policy requirements
of the Communist Parties in other countries in meeting its
obligations towards the _class struggle_ or national struggle in
their respective countries. However, this problem somewhat
lost its seriousness as more than a dozen countries came
under the Socialist system after the Second World War.
_Capitalism_ became less capable of annihilating the developing
Socialist World. But this was not the situation during
the first half of the 1940s when the _World Capitalism_ had
been trying to destroy the lone Socialist country in different
ways. The _Nazi_ military attack on the Soviet Union was the
culmination of this attempt. The Soviet Union, while mainly
relying on its own strength, needed the help of the imperialists
of Britain, France and the US A., to give a fitting
counter-blow to the _Nazi_ aggressors.

This placed not only the Communists but also those
_Congressmen_ and _Congress Socialists_ who had adopted an
_anti-fascist_ approach in India in a quandary. All of them
desired a Soviet victory in its _anti-fascist_ war and all of them
were prepared to do what they could in this regard. They
protested against the obstacles put in their way by the British
government. All of them agreed in the opinion that the British
government should change its policy in such a way that they
were able to help the Soviet Union. It was in fact the refusal
of the government to change its policy that led Congress
and the _Congress Socialist Party_ to the _Quit India Struggle_.
It was the same that led Subhas Bose to form the _Indian
National Army_ (_INA_) and the _Azad Hind_ Government and
to cooperate with Japan. Before entering into the details of
these, it is, however, necessary to dwell on the confusion
that existed within the _Communist Party_ on this issue.

During the first stage of the Second World War, the
international and national policies of the _Communist Party
of India_ were fully compatible with each other. It was not
at all difficult for the Party then to expose the fact that the
British imperialists were the main obstacle on the path of
creating the condition for waging a real _anti-fascist_ war and
that the war they were fighting was not an _anti-fascist_ war but
an imperialist war. Nor was it difficult for the Party to
state the need of starting an _anti-British_ mass struggle on
the ground that the same British rulers who had been pursuing
a pro-fascist policy were taking measures to continue
their domination over India. It was also easy to expose the
Congress leadership which was adopting a compromising
policy in this regard and to rally the people against it.

On this the _Congress Socialist_ and the _Forward Bloc_
had no disagreement with the Communists. But as regards
the international outlook, the former parties were at
loggerheads with the Communists. They did not agree with
the assessment of the Communists that the Second World
War was the result of the fundamental contradiction between
the Socialist society represented by the Soviet Union and the
capitalist world represented by the rulers of other countries
and that since Britain and France were the representatives of
the _anti-Soviet_ attitude, the war they were fighting was definitely
an imperialist war. They argued that the meaning of the
Communist stand was that they would give up their _antiBritish_
stand once Britain changed her attitude towards the
Soviet Union while maintaining the attitude towards India
unchanged. For this and other reasons the relations of these
parties with the _Communist Party_ continued to deteriorate.

The situation changed with the entry of the _Nazi_ forces
into the Soviet Union and the subsequent British-Soviet
pact. The incompatibility between the international interest
with regard to the victory of the Soviet Union's _anti-fascist_
war and the national interest of India's fight against the
British imperialist domination came to the surface. Differences
arose within the leadership of the _Communist Party_ on
the question of how to resolve these difficult problems that
resulted from the incompatibility of interests.

The leadership of the Party which remained outside
the jail considered that although the entry of the Soviet
Union had brought about a fundamental change in the international
character of the war, the Indian people could not
extend cooperation to Britain's war efforts, since the policy
of the British rulers towards India had not undergone any
change. The comrades in jails argued, on the other hand,
that 22nd June 1941 marked the beginning of a new phase
in world politics and that it was wrong not to perceive
its importance. After a protracted exchange of views between
the comrades inside and outside the jail for about six
months, the party leadership outside the jail (the Politburo)
adopted a resolution on 15th December 1941 generally
accepting the views of the comrades inside the jail.

The _Communist International_ in general and the _Communist
Party_ of Great Britain in particular had helped the
party leadership in taking this decision. They pointed out
to the _Indian Communists_ that adopting an approach towards
the war purely on the basis of the British attitude
towards India would be a _bourgeois_ nationalist approach
and not of proletarian internationalism that Communists
were expected to uphold. Although the Politburo could
not accept their arguments in the beginning, it prepared a
note entitled "Our New line on War: British Comrades
Correct Us" and included it in the _Party Letter_, a secret
publication of the party.

It must be noted in particular that one of the documents
on the basis of which the Party stated that the "British
Comrades Correct Us" was a letter which the General Secretary
of the _British Communist Party_, Harry Pollitt, had
sent to the members of that Party in December 1941. During
the first phase of the war, finding the incompatibility between
the _class struggle_ in his own country and the international
stand on the war, Pollitt requested permission from the
Party leadership to resign the general secretaryship. When
the permission was granted, he relinquished the post. Pollitt
then could not subscribe to the view characterizing the
war which was causing danger to the national interest of
Britain as an imperialist war. In the second phase of the
war, when Britain joined hands with the Soviet Union to fight
the _anti-fascist_ war, the working class and the _Communist
Party_ in India had to face a situation similar to that the
British working class and the _Communist Party_ had to face
during the first phase of the war. Although Harry Pollitt
had resigned the party general secretaryship, he fully participated
in carrying out the party decision. Furthermore, he
played an important role in the second phase of the war to
make the _Communist Party of India_ adopt a policy which
was fully acceptable to him.

These incidents are recounted here to get a clear picture
of the role played by Indian Communists in the period immediately
following the _Quit India Struggle_. Those who accuse
the Communists of characterizing the "imperialist war" as
"Peoples' war" 'overnight' for the sole reason that the
Soviet Union had entered the war must remember these facts.

The characterization of the war by Communists as
'imperialist' in its first phase and as "peoples' war" in the second
phase was based on one and the same principle. It is certainly
a crucial issue what attitude the ruling classes of Britain
take towards the Soviet Union which is destined to decide
the future of the human society. The _Communist Party_ had
never hidden its stand on this issue. Everyone who is interested
in man's onward march to Socialism would take the
same stand. It is noteworthy that the same Congress leader--
ship which later gave the call for the _Quit India Struggle_ had
adopted a resolution after the outbreak of the German-Soviet
war expressing sympathy to the Soviet people and praising
the Socialist system they were building. As we are going to
show in the next chapter, by adopting this stand, the Congress
leadership was striving to negotiate with the British in a new
form for a compromise. The Communist Party which had
been opposing the Congress policy of bargain continued its
opposition to that policy. The _Communist Party_ was of the
opinion that in the atmosphere of the decisive war being
fought between the _Nazi_ army and the Soviet Red army, the
way to India's freedom was opposition to fascism relying on its
own forces. As stated in the resolution of the Politburo
published on 15th December:

>Our policy in the present phase differs from the policy of
the national _bourgeois_ leadership in the same way as our
policy in the imperialist phase of the war differed from
their corresponding policy in that phase. Then they did
not frankly and openly declare it to be an imperialist war
which required an unconditional opposition. They dodged
and prevaricated, put up constitutional opposition, made
gestures of mass opposition to war, and ultimately settled
down with _individual satyagraha_ to wait for compromise
at the next favourable opportunity. One thing they did
not want was to rely upon people, to put up real resistance
'against war. Today they again refuse to rouse the people
to the consciousness that they have to win it in common
with other peoples of the world in order to ensure their
own freedom. They refuse to rely upon the people, to
rouse them to such activity and initiative that will smash
the obstacles which prevent India from playing her part
in the struggle for world liberation and thus paving the
way for her own liberation.[^24/2]
