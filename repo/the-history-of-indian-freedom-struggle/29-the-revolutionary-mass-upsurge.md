# THE REVOLUTIONARY MASS UPSURGE

## THE BEGINNING OF A STORM

Although the leaders of the Congress and the _Muslim
League_ were striving to win Indian independence and Pakistan
through bargains with the British, the feelings of the
Indian people were against this approach. Theirs was, in
general, the revolutionary approach of ending the British
rule through uncompromising mass struggles as distinct from
the _bourgeois_ class approach of bargain and compromise.

Worker's strikes and people's agitations for food which
broke out on a massive scale soon after the war led to frequent
clash between the people and the police and military
forces. In August 1945, 17 demonstrators were killed and
about 2,000 were arrested in Varanasi. In Bombay,an atmosphere
of revolt prevailed following a strike in September.

However, the efforts made by reactionary politicians and the
rulers to give it the character of a tension between Hindus
and Muslims succeeded to an extent. In this dozens of
people were killed several hundreds injured.

There were indications of the resurgence of people's
_anti-imperialist_ feelings which were remaining in a subdued
state during the war. Though with a semblance of Hindu-Muslim
frictions resulting from the propaganda of the indivisibility
of India conducted by the Congress and that of
the need to form an independent Sovereign Muslim nation
(Pakistan) conducted by the _League_, these constituted undeniable
evidence of the intense desire of the people to end
the British rule. While in many places an atmosphere of
tension and clash between Hindus and Muslims was created,
almost everywhere demonstrations were taking place with
the participation of the entire people above religious considerations.

As distinct from the earlier _anti-imperialist_ mass
upsurges, the people participating in them now were considerably
influenced by the fighting organizations of workers
and other labouring masses as well as the leftist parties
which provided a revolutionary perspective to them. The
_Communist Party_ which developed as a revolutionary mass
Party challenging the Congress leadership during the war
and the _Quit India Struggle_, the Socialists and other leftists
who had provided an organized leadership to the _Quit India
Struggle_ were able to play significant roles in the post-war
_anti-imperialist_ mass upsurges. Although all of them
except the _Communist Party_ were under the ideological
influence of the right-wing Congress leadership, they were
unable to imbibe emotionally the approach of the Congress
leadership. They felt sure that the opportunity had come to
wage an uncompromising struggle against the British imperialist
domination for a final victory and consequently were
unable to adjust themselves with the compromising policy
of the Congress leadership. Although identified themselves
fully with the Congress leadership in their attempts to
"isolate the Communists" accusing them of having "betrayed
the _Quit India Struggle_", these forces having been caught
in the high tide of strikes and _anti-imperialist_ demonstrations
began to cooperate with the Communists to impart
strength and militancy to these movements.

Two events which took place towards the end of 1945
played a significant role in raising post-war _anti-imperialist_
storms: the _INA trial_ and the decision of the government to
send Indian soldiers to Indonesia, Indo-China and other
South and South-East Asian countries. In organizing huge
demonstrations against these acts, Communists, Socialists as
well as the ranks of the Congress and the _League_ played
active roles.

With the defeat and surrender of Japan, the _INA_ consisting
of about 20,000 officers and men came under the
control of the British. The British government charged them with
failure to fulfil the obligation of loyalty to the British and
decided to try them for treason. As indicated earlier, the
_Communist Party_ or even the prominent Congress leaders
like Jawaharlal Nehru had no sympathy to the decision of
Subhas Bose to help the advance of Japan by forming the
_INA_. But none of them questioned the sense of patriotism
of Bose. In fact, _anti-imperialists_ had greatly appreciated
the cooperation extended by the former army officers and
men to Bose and other patriots who were led by the great
objective of liberating the country from the British. Therefore,
when Col. Shanavas, Capt. Dhillon and Capt. Sahgal,
who played most significant role in the _INA_, were tried and
sentenced to a long period of imprisonment. The people considered
it as an attack on the _anti-imperialist_ movement.
Demonstrations against the sentence were held throughout
the country and the government resorted to all repressive
methods including firing to disperse the demonstrators. But,
braving these repressive actions, the people surged ahead.
These protest actions took the highest form in Calcutta where
workers struck work for several days bringing the electric
power stations, transport, water supply, etc., to a standstill.
People raised barricades in the southern parts of Calcutta
and set fire to military vehicles. The Governor of Bengal
deployed the military to bring the situation under control.

Despite these repressive measures, there was no letup
in the people's actions until Sarat Chandra Bose, brother of
Subhas Bose and a top Congress leader, gave a call to stop all
demonstrations. Bose assured the people that the _INA_
officers who had been sentenced would be released and that
the Congress would strive to gain national independence
through "lawful and _non-violent_ means".

_Anti-imperialist_ demonstrations demanding the release
of the _INA leaders_ were also held in many other places
like Bombay, Mathura, Delhi, Meerut and Peshawar. In the
clashes that occurred in the course of these demonstrations, 40 people were killed in Calcutta and 23 in Bombay. Several
hundreds were injured in police actions all over the country.

Disregarding the people's actions in protest against the
_INA trial_, the British authorities went ahead with their decision.
In February 1946, Capt. Abul Rashid was tried, which
again led to a wave of protest demonstrations in Bengal.
This time the appeal to stop the demonstrations came from the
newly elected Chief Minister of Bengal, H. S. Suhrawardy.

While the leaders of the Congress and the _League_ were
engaged in the bargain with the British rulers to achieve their
respective demands, the people were expressing their protest
against the government's decision to send the Indian troops
to Indo-China and Indonesia on the pretext of completely
liberating the Japanese occupied countries after Japan's
defeat in the war. In each of these countries the people had
already set up their own national revolutionary government
in place of the imperialist rulers who had fled before the
Japanese invaders. Communists like Ho Chi Minh and comrades
in Indo-China, and _non-Communist_ nationalists like
Dr. Sukarno in Indonesia and Aung San in Burma were
leading these revolutionary governments. The British government
was trying to use the Indian troops to suppress these
revolutionary governments and restore the British imperialist
dominance in Burma, Malaya, and Singapore, the French in
Indo-China and the Dutch in Indonesia.

Demonstrations in protest against this were held all over
the country. Port workers in Bombay and Calcutta refused to
handle the shipments of military supplies and food to the
troops in Indonesia. The leaders of the Congress and the
_Muslim League_ openly protested against the government's
actions. The Congress leaders called upon the people to
observe 25th October as '_South-East Asia Day_'.

It may be stated that this was a beginning of the policy
of Asian friendship adopted by the _bourgeois_ leadership of
the Congress after independence. By observing the _South-East
Asia Day_ the Congress was making the claim that they
were not only fighting for independence of their own country
but also of the neighbouring countries and that they were
striving to sent out all imperialist powers from Asia along
with the British from India. It laid the foundation of the
active role played later by the _bourgeois_ leadership of the
Indian government in the _Bandung Conference_ and in other
Asian developments.

During the same period also appeared another aspect of
the Congress policy which revealed itself later, the policy of
"cooperation instead of confrontation" with the imperialists.
An incident occurred which pointed to these two aspects of
the same policy pursued by Nehru as the Prime Minister of
Independent India. Nehru expressed the desire to visit
Burma, Malaya and Indonesia to meet the national leaders
of these countries and to study the conditions of the Indians
living there. The British authorities in Malaya gave him
permission to enter the country subject to certain conditions.
But Nehru was not prepared to accept those conditions.
Lord Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander
of South-East Asia, realized the possible consequences of
refusing permission to Nehru who was likely to be prime
minister of Free India in the near future to visit these countries
and cancelled their earlier order imposing conditions. He
made arrangements for receiving Nehru at the airport with
all official courtesies and for facilities for his visits. This was
the first link in the chain of events leading to Mountbatten,
as the last Governor General of British India administering
the swearing in of Nehru and Jinnah, the former as the
Prime Minister of India, and the latter as the Governor
General of Pakistan.

This was the beginning not merely of the friendly
relation that developed between Nehru and Mountbatten; it
was also the beginning of the final effort to be made by the
_bourgeois_ leadership of the Congress to achieve their class
objective by coming to terms with the imperialist rulers,
while, at the same time, giving shape to _anti-imperialist_
feelings of the people and remaining in the forefront of the
mass upsurge that gave expression to these feelings. This
effort being made by the Congress leaders including Nehru
later gave rise to a number of contradictions. As we are going
to see in the following chapters, it led to the creation of a
gulf between a section of top Congress leaders including
Gandhi, on the one hand, and Nehru, Patel, Rajagopalachari
and certain other leaders, on the other. But immediately it
helped to enhance the popularity of the Congress. It also
helped them to create the impression that it was the Congress
that was standing in front of the people who were opposed
to the trial of the _INA_ men and to the deployment of Indian
troops to South-East Asia. It turned out to be an instrument
which could be effectively used in its election campaigns.

## THE _NAVAL MUTINY_

The Indian soldiers and young officers of the British
armed forces in India were not entirely free from the impact
of the mass actions in protest against the trial of the _INA_
men. Its impact took the highest form in the mutiny in the
_Royal Indian Navy_ in Bombay in February 1946. A month
before that the Indian airmen in the _Royal Indian Air Force_
mutinied and went on a strike in protest against racial discrimination
in the air force. The same feeling of discrimination
was present among the Indian members in all branches of
the British armed forces in India. But none of them reached
the form of the February _Naval mutiny_ which was historically
the most important incident in the post-war _anti-imperialist_
upsurge.

Fundamental changes had taken place during the war
in the structure of the army, air force and navy as well as in
the feelings and emotions of those who had joined these
branches of the armed forces. During the war, members of
the armed forces were not recruited from the so-called
"martial races" in selected provinces in India, as was the
case with the recruitments in the earlier periods. Now several
thousands of young men belonging to all castes and religions
from all provinces had joined the British armed forces in
India. Besides, there were now Indians in the armed forces
who performed technically skilled jobs which required
specialized training. Consequently, unlike the soldiers recruited
earlier, they were not prepared to submit themselves as mercenaries
and refused to put up with discrimination and
injustice. But there was no change in the views and behaviour
of the British officers of higher ranks towards the Indian
soldiers. They behaved as if they were born to rule India
and every Indian was obliged to submit himself before them.
Another thing that irritated the young Indian officers and
men was the racial discrimination meted out to them in
regard to pay, accommodation, food, demobilization benefit
and other service conditions. The Indians who often excelled
the whites in the jobs which required technical skill were
lower than the whites in rank. If anyone protested against
this, the white officers would shower abuse on them.

The younger officers and men were no longer prepared
to tolerate this situation. For, those who had occasions to
fight shoulder to shoulder with the British in foreign lands
had often witnessed incidents of the British soldiers of the
'omnipotent' imperialist rulers fleeing before the enemy
action, while the Indian soldiers stayed and fought the enemy
courageously. Besides, a section of Indian soldiers had
acquired a broader outlook as a result of the close contact
they had occasion to get with the _Allied forces_, particularly
the Soviet armed forces. They had developed an attitude
against fascism and in favour of freedom, democracy and
Socialism. Above all, the _Quit India Struggle_ and the formation
of _INA_ and the advance it had made in the initial stages
had exerted considerable influence on the Indian soldiers.
They had dreamt of the time when leaders like _Mahatma
Gandhi_ and Subhas Bose would wield political power in
India. They were eagerly looking for the opportunity to
serve under the national leaders. In other words, the tide of
national consciousness had considerably influenced them.

Unfortunately, no significant attempts have been made
to make a detailed and deep study of this process. The kind
of efforts to collect and publish historical facts with regard
to the 1857 revolt have not yet been made in the case of the
_naval mutiny_ and the related incidents. BC Dutt, who had
played a leading role in the _RIN mutiny_, stated:

>All the relevant records pertaining to the _Royal Indian
Naval Mutiny_ are in the archives of the Defence Ministry.
A comprehensive account of the Mutiny can be written
only at the instance of the Government of India. No official
history, however, has as yet been attempted nor has any
private initiative been encouraged. Someday, perhaps, the
historian of a future generation, free from the prejudices
and pressures of the present, will want to record the full
and unbiased story of the freedom movement. It is quite
likely that he will be both interested and enlightened
enough to appreciate the fact that there were many ways
of being an Indian patriot in those days before Independence.
When he comes across the story of the _RIN Mutiny_
he may not be inclined to dismiss the motive behind the
upheaval as just a violent agitation for a better quality
rice-and-_daal_ ration, as was given out to the people.[^29/1]

[^29/1]: BC Dutt, _Mutiny of the Innocents_, Bombay, Sindhu publications, 1971, p. 13.

In his book, Dutt describes the formation of a secret
organization called the '_Azad Hind_' to work in a self-sacrificing
manner in accordance with the national sentiments
kindled by the _INA_ movement and also the several incidents
which took place with its initiative.

The developments in _HMIS[^hmis] Talwar_ began with the
carefully organized demonstration on the Navy Day of 17th
December. Slogans like '_Quit India_', '_Down with Imperialism_',
etc., were inscribed on the _Talwar_. Although the authorities
were able to wipe off these slogans, they failed either to
discover the organized force behind it or to eliminate it. That
force was advancing step-by-step culminating in the mutiny
of about 20,000 naval ratings in all the ships stationed in
Bombay. The mutiny soon spread to the port cities like
Vishakhapatnam, Calcutta and Karachi. In Bombay, workers
went on strike and the people observed _hartal_ in sympathy
with mutineers. The encounter that followed between the
workers and the police and military forces in the streets of
Bombay on 22nd February is well-known. This was the highest
form of the post-war revolutionary upsurge.

[^hmis]: The Royal Indian Navy's ships carried the prefix HMIS, for His Majesty's Indian Ship

The very title of Dutt's book, _Mutiny of the Innocents_,
is significant in that it indicated the lack of correspondence
between the political reality and the inspiration they had
drawn from the _Quit India Struggle_ and _INA_. They entered
in the mutiny on the belief that the role they were playing
in the struggle for Indian independence would be decisive
and as such they believed that the national leadership would
bless them and render all assistance to them. Dutt's compliant
was that they did not get any assistance from the
national leadership as they had anticipated. The essence
of Dutt's evaluation was that they had not understood
that the national leaders were not striving at ending the
British rule by driving them out of the country but at sharing
the power through negotiations with the British rulers.
S Natarajan, then editor of the _Free Press Journal_, a Bombay
newspaper which gave wide publicity and assistance to the
mutineers, slated in the preface to Dutt's book:

>I was greatly amused at one stage to receive a message
from Mr. Asaf Ali who was in Bombay on a short visit.
His host dropped in one evening ... and taking me aside
said very solemnly: "Asaf Ali has told me to remind you
that Indians will soon be in power. It will be very difficult
for the Defence Minister if the strictest discipline is not
upheld now." There was more of this, with the suggestion
that Asaf Ali was expected to be the Defence Minister himself. ...
It was indicative of the new attitude of _Congressmen_
who feeling that Independence was at hand feared
that the last delicate negotiations would be upset by anything
the British disapproved.[^29/2]

[^29/2]: _Ibid_, p. 7.

Natarajan blamed the Congress and the _League_, the two
main elements of the national leadership, for neglecting the
_naval mutiny_. Basing themselves on the British propaganda
that the naval ratings were engaged in a struggle to improve
the ration of rice and _daal_", the leaders of the Congress and
the _League_ gave them the assurance that these problems
would be solved. They refused to recognize the fact that the
_naval mutiny_ was a revolutionary struggle against racial discrimination
and for '_Quit India_' and other demands. They
failed to imbibe the feelings of the ratings and the young
officers who were engaged in such revolutionary acts as taking
up arms and arresting the senior officers. The national
leadership was not prepared to promote it to the level of a
general armed revolt of all-India scale by spreading the naval
revolt and the strike that took place in Bombay in connection
with it to the ranks and young officers of army and air force.

Dutt did not exclude from criticism Aruna Asaf Ali and
other left-wing _Congressmen_ who had risen to the leadership
of the left revolutionary movement through the _Quit
India Struggle_ or the _Communist Party_ which was regarded
as the symbol of revolution. At the same time, he did not
deny the fact that they, as distinct form the leaders of the
Congress and the _League_, expressed themselves in favour
of the mutiny through their statements. They however, took
the attitude that only the national leadership was able to
carry forward the revolutionary movement which started with
the _naval mutiny_. That is, Dutt accused the leftists as well
as those known to be revolutionaries that their activities
were dependent on those leaders who had adopted the method
of negotiations, rather than the method of revolution.

It must be admitted that there is an element of truth
in this accusal. Aruna and her colleagues of _Quit India_ fame
looked upon themselves as leftists within the Congress. They
never had the perspective of creating a revolutionary leadership
as opposed to that of the Congress. Although the
_Communist Party_ had been working during the war challenging
the Congress leadership, it was of the view that a struggle
based on the unity of the leaders of the Congress and the
_League_ was the only solution to the national problems of
India. In other words, although both the left Congress
leaders like Aruna and the _Communist Party_ had visualized
the path of revolution, they considered either the Congress
alone or the _Congress-League_ unity as the main instrument for
revolution.

However, it would be wrong to maintain that leftist
_Congressmen_ or the Socialists or Communists were indifferent
to the _naval mutiny_. The strike of the workers in Bombay
was not a spontaneous action. The left _Congressmen_, Socialists
and Communists had worked in an organized manner
behind it. In the clash that took place between the striking
workers and the armed forces of the government many of
them had sacrificed their lives. The truth was that they could not
raise the struggle to the level of an all-India revolutionary
movement or to spread the mutiny to the other branches of
the armed forces.

Either the leaders of the Congress and the _League_ give
up the path of negotiations and adopt the path of revolutionary
struggles, or the Communists, Socialists and the leftist
_Congressmen_ gain sufficient strength to challenge the leadership
of the Congress and the _League_ and organize mutiny
in the other branches of the armed forces and also to combine
it with the higher forms of struggle of the workers,
peasants and other working masses --- one of these conditions
should be present for raising the _naval mutiny_ to an all-India
revolution.

Indian politics was proceeding before and after the war
in a manner in which it was impossible to realize either of
these conditions. The leaderships of both the Congress and
the _League_ had already adopted the method of negotiations.
The left including the _Communist Party_, on the other hand,
had not risen to the position of the national leadership of
the Indian people including the members of the armed forces,
although they had risen to the position as the leader of the
working class in certain places like Bombay and Calcutta.
It is significant to note that the leaders of the mutiny were
looking upon the leaders of the Congress and the _League_,
not upon the leftists, with expectations. Therefore, although
the _naval mutiny_ became a great event in the history of
Indian revolution, it did not become the forerunner of Indian
revolution as expected by the organizers of the mutiny.

## THE FATEFUL ELECTIONS

The elections to the Central and provincial assemblies
were going on in parallel to the _naval mutiny_. Since it had
been declared that actions with regard to constitution-making
would be taken through the legislatures which would be
formed following these election, they were considered to be
of great importance.

The country-wide strikes and demonstrations in protest
against the _INA trial_ which took place after the announcement
of elections, had brought about a new political atmosphere
in the country. The British government which was
convinced that they would not be able to carry on for long
by denying the national demand of India, decided to send a
group of Members of Parliament to India. Since the visit of
the Parliamentary delegation visited when the leaders of the
Congress and the _League_ were engaged in a vigorous election
campaign, much attention was not paid to it. But with the
outbreak of the _naval mutiny_ in the midst of the election
campaign, the government realized the need to resume discussions
with the participation of the Congress and the
_League_.

As soon as the _naval mutiny_ broke out, the British
government decided to send a _Cabinet Mission_ to India.
This was a clear indication of their realization that they
would not be able to bring the situation under control without
creating an impression among the people that efforts were
being made to start serious negotiations on the transfer of
power. Accordingly, the three-member _Cabinet Mission_
included the Secretary of State for India, Pethick-Lawrence,
as the leader, and Stafford Cripps who was known to be
connected with India in different ways. With this the British
government appeared as determined to see that this mission
did not meet the fate of the earlier _Cripps Mission_ and the
_Simla Conference_.

This move on the part of the government gave rise
to expectations among all the political parties that elected
people's governments would be formed at the Centre and in
the provinces and problems with regard to constitution-making
solved soon after the elections. Moreover, the claim
being made by the Congress that it represented the entire
Indian people including the Muslims and that of the _League_
that it was the representative of the Muslims were going to
be tested. Further, the character of the future Central and
provincial governments and that of the future constitution
would be dependent on the results of these elections. Political
parties participating in the elections and others looked
upon it in that way.

With the announcement of the election results, both the
Congress and the _League_ came out to argue that their respective
claims had been confirmed. However, the election results
also contained certain facts that could be utilized by each of
them to make out that the other's claims were untenable.
Consequently, arguments and counter-arguments were forcefully
raised by both of them. The post-election political
situation in the country was such that the British would be
able to utilize these controversies to protect their own interests.

The Congress won a majority of seats in the Central
legislature (57 out of 102). The _Muslim League_ annexed
most of the seats reserved for Muslims. The _Nationalist
Party_ which was influential among Hindus and the _Unionist
Party_ in Punjab which was popular among Muslims failed
to get representation in the Central Assembly. Using the
election results, Jinnah continued the argument that the
Congress was the Party of Hindus and that the _League_ was
the only party of the Muslims.

The situation in the provincial legislatures was different,
Demolishing the claim of the _League_ that it was the sole
representative of Muslims, the Congress won a majority of
seats and formed its own ministries in the Muslim majority
provinces of NWF Province and Assam.

In Sind and Bengal, the _League_ failed to command a
majority in the legislature. But they were able to form
ministries there which could be sustained only with the
support of European members. Similarly, in Punjab, the
_League_ failed to command a majority. But unlike in Sind
and Bengal, it was unable to form a ministry of its own there.
Consequently, the _Unionist Party_ formed a ministry headed by
Khizr Hyat Khan with the support of the Congress and the
Sikhs.

With the formation of the ministry in Punjab, an
important change came about in the political situation in
Punjab and other provinces. The British had, in fact, tried
to foster the _Unionist Party_ as a Muslim party independent
of the _League_ but loyal to the British. It may be recalled
that at the _Simla Conference_, Viceroy Wavell had included
a representative of the _Unionist Party_ in his list of members
in the proposed _Central Executive Council_ and that Jinnah
had strongly opposed his proposal. The _League_ put up a
determined fight to defeat the _Unionist Party_ in the elections
in Punjab. Thus, the _League_ won 79 out of 86 Muslim seats
leaving the remaining seven Muslim seats to the _Unionist
Party_ which with three non-Muslim seals it had won formed
a ministry with the support of 22 _Akali_ Sikhs and 51 Congress
members. With this also failed Wavell's plan to foster
the _Unionist Party_ as a counter to the claims made both by
the Congress and the _League_.

This new situation raised a question before the rulers:
which party they should favour now? The _Cabinet Mission_
was divided over this question. Wavell was of the opinion
that, since the _Unionist Party_ had no future, their favour
should go to the _League_. But Cripps was in favour of the
Congress. The leader of the Mission, Pethick-Lawrence
supported Cripps, while the third member of the Mission,
A. V. Alexander, favoured Wavell. This difference of opinion
reflected in the entire work of the Mission.

There was a similar difference of opinion within the
Congress leadership also. There emerged the opinion that
considering the proved influence of the Congress throughout
country and that of the _League_ in the Muslim community, it
would be wise to form _Congress-League_ coalition ministries
in all the provinces. The other opinion was that since it had
been proved that the _League_ was weak even in those Muslim
majority provinces which it claimed to form part of Pakistan,
the right way was to utilize all anti-_League_ political
forces and destroy _League_'s influence among the Muslims.

Even if _Congress-League_ coalition ministries were to be
formed, the _League_ would not allow _non-League_ Muslim ministers
in the cabinet. Since this was not acceptable to the
Congress, attempts made to form coalition ministries in Sind
and Punjab failed.

Clearly, this was the continuation of the controversy
which was raised at the _Simla Conference_. But the situations
then and now were different. Wavell then tried to induct
a _non-League_ _non-Congress_ Muslim into the ministry
disregarding the claims made by both the Congress and the
_League_. But now even Wavell could not make such of attempt.
Consequently, he had now moved to the position of
accepting the stand taken by the _League_. Even Cripps could
not make him change his stand. Thus, Congress ministries
were formed in the Muslim majority provinces of NWFP
and Assam, while in two other Muslim majority provinces
of Bengal and Sind the _League_ formed ministries which depended
entirely on the European members for their existence.
In Punjab, although the _League_ won in a majority of the
Muslim constituencies, a ministry opposed to the _League_ was
formed with the participation of the Congress in it. This
made the _Congress-League_ conflict sharper.

Gandhi who understood that this would take the country
to a dangerous situation began to think in terms which were
not likely to be appreciated by his colleagues. He felt not
only that the gulf between the Congress and the _League_ was
widening but also that the British rulers were utilizing the
situation to endanger the future of independent India. With
a view to avert such a situation, Gandhi suggested in his
first interview with the _Cabinet Mission_ that Jinnah should
be invited to form an interim government at the Centre.
Gandhi was prompted by the consideration that Jinnah,
on assuming the position of Prime Minister, would have
to deal with problems with a sense of responsibility and
would be compelled to adopt an attitude of conciliation.
Herein lay hidden the source of the difference between Gandhi
and his Congress colleagues which surfaced when the Congress
accepted office in accordance with the Mountbatten plan
in August 1947.

A majority of the members of the _Working Committee_
who were known to be disciples of Gandhi were eager to
take office as soon as possible by forming an interim government.
To suit that purpose they were prepared to accept, at
least to an extent, the claims made by Jinnah. It was this
eagerness that influenced them in the discussions first with
the _Cabinet Mission_ and later with Mountbatten.

As for Gandhi, there was no eagerness to take office.
He thought that the claim made by Jinnah was not an
independent and isolated phenomenon and that there was a
strategy of the British rulers behind it. He was of the
opinion that if _Congressmen_ yielded to schemes which would
water down the national stand of the Congress without perceiving
the designs of the rulers, it would lead to widespread
communal riots. Gandhi repeatedly cautioned his colleagues
against its consequences.

Whatever be the merit of Gandhi's approach, it suffered
from a weakness on the practical plane. The political power
which a majority of the _Working Committee_ members were
eagerly awaiting would not pass into the Congress. Instead,
he was suggesting that power should be passed into the hands
of Jinnah whom the _Congressmen_ considered to be adopting
all methods to destroy the Congress. Consequently, the _Working
Committee_ rejected Gandhi's proposal and conducted
negotiations with Jinnah and the _Cabinet Mission_ on sharing
power.

Now, imagine that the Congress leadership had accepted
Gandhi's proposal. Then, would it have been acceptable
to the Viceroy and Jinnah? Supposing that it was acceptable
to them, then to what end Jinnah would have used the new
political power which had passed in his hands? What repercussions
it would have created among the non-Muslim communities
in the country? It is impossible to answer these questions.

Gandhi himself had not examined the problems in details.
Finding no alternative in ending the tensions in the relationships
between the Congress and the _Muslim League_ on the
one side and those among the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh
communities on the other, which were deteriorating day by
day, Gandhi put forth the proposal on a "_let-us-try_" basis.

This, however, did not create any impact either on Jinnah
or any other political party. For, while making the suggestion
to invite Jinnah to form an interim government at the
Centre, a government with the participation of the Congress
had already been formed in Punjab excluding the _League_
which had won a majority of Muslim seats. The attempts
made in provinces to form _Congress-League_ coalition governments
had failed on account of the controversies with regard
to the political character of the Muslim ministers. As such
none considered Gandhi's proposal as of practical importance.
