# RIVALRIES AND NEGOTIATIONS

## THE BEGINNING OF COMMUNAL RIOTS

We have noted earlier that as the _Khilafat_ and _non-cooperation_
movement developed into a mass movement, the
rivalry between the Hindus and Muslims was pushed to the
background and the unity between the two communities
strengthened. However, in the last phase of this movement
itself, the unity broke up and communal riots began to break
out at least in some places like Malabar and Multan.

As the _Swaraj Party_ and the Gandhian organizations
like the _Spinner's Association_ began to function following
the withdrawal of the _non-cooperation_ and _civil disobedience
programmes_, the Hindu-Muslim problem became acute as
never before. The Hindu and Muslim leaders drifted apart
and began to raise the demand of their respective communities.
They were, however, not content now with creating
public opinion by issuing press statements and making
public speeches and with submitting petitions to the authorities
and using the Central and provincial legislatures as platforms
to raise the demands of their respective communities.
Communal riots broke out with the participation of hundreds
of thousands among both the communities leaving dozens of
people killed and several more injured in each such riot.
After the end of each riot, leaders of both the communities
accused each other for the holocaust. It may be recalled
that the more prominent among them were those who had
held high the banner of Hindu-Muslim unity during the
_Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_ movement.

It was in 1923 that Hindu-Muslim riots shot up as an
important political issue. In December 1923, the Congress
session was held at Cocanada (now, Kakinada). It was
presided over by one of the stalwarts of the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_
movement, Maulana Mohammed Ali, who
emphasized the need for preserving the Hindu-Muslim unity.
He utilized the opportunity to eloquently point out how his
Muslim brethren stood to gain if they cooperated with the
Hindu brethren, and the great loss they would suffer if they
cooperated with the British government. Highlighting the
fact that a firm believer in Hinduism (_Mahatma Gandhi_)
had gone to jail in defence of Islam, he asked: "What is it
that has happened since that staunch Hindu, _Mahatma
Gandhi_, went to the goal for advocating the cause of Islam
that we must cease to cooperative with his co-religionists?"

Notwithstanding Mohammed Ali's impassioned speech
from the Congress rostrum, a vast change had already started
taking place in both the Hindu and Muslim political leaders.
Among the stalwarts who had stood shoulder-to-shoulder in
the _non-cooperation_ movement, Pandit Malaviya, Lala
Lajpat Rai and many others had already joined the _Hindu
Mahasabha_, while many of the Muslim leaders joined the
_Muslim League_. This tendency had reached its zenith in 1924, the year in which the office of _Caliph_ was abolished
as a result of the political changes brought about in Turkey
under Kamal Pasha. With this disappeared the basic cause
of the _Khilafat_ movement.

With the launching of the _Khilafat_ movement, the
_Muslim League_ remained active. After the movement
failed, a meeting of the _League_ was held in Many 1924 at
Lahore which emphasized certain demands to be included
in the future constitution of the country. One of the main
demands was that the general nature of the constitution
should be federal with complete autonomy to the provinces
except in certain common subjects which were to be given
to the Centre. The second proposal concerned the representation
in the provincial legislatures. It emphasized that in
all elected institutions the minority should have adequate
and effective representation, through constituencies in which
the members of that particular community alone could
exercise franchise. It was also demanded that no bill or
resolution should be deemed passed if it was opposed by
three-fourths of the members belonging to any particular
community. The _League_ asked the Government to take
immediate steps to establish a fully _responsible government_,
incorporating these demands of the minority community.

On the other side, the _Hindu Mahasabha_ started
vigorous activities under the leadership of Malaviya. Defending
the organization in which the membership was restricted
exclusively to the Hindus, Malaviya said that since the
Congress was a political organization, it could not deal with
the social and other non-political problems of the different
communities, hence the need to organize the _Hindu Mahasabha_.
The Muslims valued their culture and the Hindus too
should value their culture, should preserve it and propagate
it, he said.

The attempts of each to value its own 'cultural ethos'
and to preserve and propagate them ended up in _Sanghatan_
(organization) and _Shuddhi_ (reclaiming the Muslim converts)
on the part of the Hindus and in _Tabligh_ (conversion to Islam)
and _Tanzim_ (providing models) on the part of the Muslims.
Attempts were made to convert the Hindus to Islam and the
Muslims to Hinduism. Volunteer organizations were formed
for this purpose. In the words of Malaviya, "Muslims have
been converting Hindus to Islam for centuries. The majority
of the present-day Muslims in India are Hindu converts.
Innumerable Christian organizations are engaged in religious
conversion. Therefore, the question of forming a Hindu organization
for conversion has become urgent".

A number of practical issues cropped up in this background.
The Muslims objected to the Hindus taking out
processions in front of mosques, playing instruments. They
complained that the growth of the Banyan trees worshiped
by the Hindus were obstructing their _Tazia_ processions. The
Hindus, on the other hand, protested against slaughtering
cows by the Muslims in public places in connection with the
celebration of _Id_ and other religious festivals.

Each such issue led to quarrels and clashes in many
localities, On both the sides several people were killed and
wounded. Serious clashes took place in Calcutta, Delhi and
Gulberga (then in Hyderabad State). The worst kind of riot
took place in Kohat in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP). The
communal passion and the resultant riots that erupted towards
the end of the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_ movement in
Malabar and Multan spread all over the country.

It is worth mentioning here that the Hindu and Muslim
members of the committees appointed to enquire into each
of these riots prepared reports which contradicted with each
other. For instance, Gandhi and Shaukat Ali were deputed
to enquire into the Kohat riots. Since the government did
not allow them to visit the spot, many went to them to give
evidence. The report prepared by Gandhi contained indications
that the Muslims were responsible for the riots,
whereas Shaukat Ali's report suggested provocation on the
part of the Hindus.

If this was the stand of the two most respected leaders
of the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_ days, the position of the not
so well respected can well be imagined. And these were
reflected in the approaches of the Congress, the _Muslim
League_ and the _Hindu Mahasabha_. Beyond expressing regret
over the riots, the Congress was never willing to fix the
blame on anybody. Like the Congress, the _Muslim League_
and the _Hindu Mahasabha_ expressed regret; each put the
blame on the other community. In other words, debates were
carried out on communal lines.

Attempts were made to find a solution to this situation
at various levels. In Bengal, on the initiative of
CR Das, leaders of both the communities signed a pact.
The _All-India Congress Committee_ appointed a committee
consisting of Dr. Ansari and Lala Lajpat Rai to prepare a
draft political agreement at all-India level. Motilal Nehru
and Abul Kalam Azad took the initiative to form "an
organization above communal thinking". They visualized
their new organization as one in which the membership would
be open only to those who declared that they were not and
would not become members of any party or organization
which the central leadership of the new organization considered
communal.

However, more important was the 21-days fast which
Gandhi undertook on 17th September 1924 to express his
mental agony over the countrywide riots and the consequent
loss of life and property. As expected, the fast helped to
turn people's attention towards the issue of communal unity.
The fast and the discussions that were held during the period
helped to bring about formally some temporary understanding.

The issues like procession in front of mosques, cow
slaughter and religious conversion, however, eluded a permanent
solution. For this and for the reason that there remained
disputes over the details of the _constitutional reforms_, communal
riots still continued. During the year 1925 after Gandhi
terminated his fast, 16 riots took place at different places in
the country. According to the official estimates, 112 communal
riots broke out in the years between 1922 and 1927 leaving 450 killed and more than 5000 injured. Of these 112
riots, 21 took place in 1926 alone.

The Hindu and Muslim leaders pointed their accusing
finger at each other for their instinct for violence to which
they attributed the unprecedented danger that loomed large
over Indian politics. "Pure nationalists" who were not
aligned to either of the camps came to the conclusion that
the communal strife was the result of the British strategy of
"divide and rule". MN Roy who was closely observing
the situation as the spokesman of the _Communist International_
as well as the then existing Communist groups in
India had pointed out that along with the British tactics, the
selfish interest of a small minority among the _bourgeois_-landlord
classes in India was also responsible for the strife.
They also blamed the reactionary outlook of the political
leaders belonging to both the communities.

For instance, an article in the name of the _Communist
Party of India_ that appeared in MN Roy's journal, _Vanguard_
dated 18th October 1923, stated:

>How to unite Hindus and Muslims? So far all the attempts
for such a union have failed. So long as the political
movement in India carried partially or wholly on religious
ground the unity will not be realised. The liquidation of
the _khilafat_ conference will not solve the problem.
National Congress as a political force is practically dead,
and a sort of amalgamation with a dead body will not
make much difference. Some radical changes are required
to create Hindu-Muslim unity and to revive the struggle
for the independence.[^11/1]

[^11/1]: _Vanguard_, Vol. 3, No.4, reprinted in Adhikari, _op. cit_, Vol 2, p. 212.

Suggesting a solution to the Hindu-Muslim problem the
article continues:

>Have the Hindus and Muslim masses nothing in common
in India? Are both of them not suffering equally under the
ruthless exploitation of British imperialism? Are they not
economically ruined by the British and Indian capitalists
and landlords? The union can only be realised when they
are told of their common grievances, so that they should
be conscious of their common miserable plight. It may be
difficult for _bourgeois_ political philosophy to find a common
ground to stand upon. The masses --- the common workers
and peasants --- are however as a matter of fact already
united by virtue of their common economic interests, only
the consciousness of this union is interfered with by large
doses of conflicting religious dogmas administered by
interested parties. Religious propaganda is an ingenious
method of exploitation of the _ignorant masses_ by the able
doctors of divinity. This they have to do in order to preserve
feudal rights of the upper classes, without whose
support they cannot live and prosper.[^11/2]

[^11/2]: _Ibid_, pp. 212--213.

The same idea were found expressed in different forms
in the journals run by _Indian Communists_, like the _Socialist_
of SA Dange. The documents collected by Dr. G. Adhikari
included some such views. All these showed clearly
that right from the inception of the _Communist Party_ as
a movement, a new approach towards the Hindu-Muslim
strife, as in the case of many other problems, appeared on
the Indian political scene. As distinct from the _bourgeois_- _petty-bourgeois_
approach, this new, Communist approach
linked the socio-cultural problem of Hindu-Muslim rift to
the political problem of _anti-imperialist_ struggle and to
the economic and political problem of the fight between the
_exploited_ and the _exploiter_.

In the then existing Indian political situation, the voice
of Communism was a very feeble one. It did not bring any
considerable change in Indian politics. But, as distinct from the
_bourgeois_-_petty-bourgeois_ politics, and challenging the very-fundamental
outlook of the religious leaderships of both
the communities, a new approach was manifest for the first
time on the Hindu-Muslim problem,concentrating on the unity
of the millions above religious, caste and other similar considerations.

## COMMUNAL AND CASTE POLITICS

As we have noted earlier, Muslin politics arose out of the
differences over the provisions contained in the 1909 and 1919
_constitutional reforms_ proposals of the British government.
Basic to the Muslim communalism and the demands raised
by the Muslim leaders was the fear that they would have to
submit themselves to the domination of the majority (Hindu)
community, once elected legislatures and governments responsible
to them came into existence. There was no dispute
over the issue of transfer of power to the Indians. The
dispute was over the rightful share they should get out of the
power going to be thus transferred. And the Muslim masses
enthusiastically rallied behind their leaders.

The demands put forward by the Muslim leaders
pertained to, among others, the representation they should get
in the legislatures, ministries and in government service with
the guarantee that those in such positions would be their
real representatives. It was because a satisfactory agreement
was made in 1916 at Lucknow in accordance with then prevailing
conditions, that Tilak, Motilal Nehru, Gandhi and
others could bring about a unity between the Hindus and the
Muslims in such a way as to enable them to conduct a joint
agitation based on the issues of _Khilafat_ and the 1919
_constitutional reforms_.

Like the Muslims, the _low-caste Hindus_, too, had
developed their own mass political agitations in the post1909
years fearing "_Brahmin_ domination in the event of
establishing a _responsible government_". The _Justice Party_
of Madras and the _non-Brahmin_ organizations of Bombay,
were next to the _Muslim League_ in terms of importance in
the growth of communal-caste politics. The _Justice Party_
had won the election in the 1920s and formed their ministry
in Madras. Following the course of the agitations organized
by the _Muslim League_ and other Muslim organizations
against Hindus, the _Justice Party_ and the _non-Brahmin_
organizations of Bombay organized widespread agitations
against _Brahmin_ domination. It was from such agitations
that leaders of anti-caste atheist movements like EV Ramaswami
Naicker emerged. In Maharashtra too, many groups
emerged as part of the _non-Brahmin_ movement, which later
became leftist parties.

The organizations of the depressed castes were formed
much later. Many of them developed into left oriented
anti-caste movements like that of Ramaswami Naicker.
Like the _Muslim League_, they also demanded representation
in the provincial-Central legislatures through electoral constituencies
reserved for them on the basis of separate electorate.
This demand for separate electorate led Gandhi to
undertake another fast to which we shall return later on.
Here we will only indicate that such a demand came to be
raised by _non-Caste Hindus_ as well as the Muslims.

Like the Muslims, _non-Brahmins_ and the depressed castes,
the minority communities like the Christians and Sikhs
too put forward their claims. They were in agreement with
the Muslims on one point, namely, that they were non-Hindus,
hence minority communities, and that they also feared the
domination by the majority (Hindu) community. But,
unlike Muslims, the Christians, devoid of a military tradition,
were leading a peaceful life. Besides, they were a minority
community in every part of the country, whereas the
Muslims constituted a majority at least in some regions or
even provinces. The Sikhs who possessed no less a military
tradition than the Muslims, were confined to one province
(Punjab). Hence, neither their claims nor their political
moves created any impact at the national level.

However, during the period in which Hindu-Muslim riots
broke out on a wide scale, the _non-Brahmins_ of Madras and
Bombay, the Sikhs in Punjab and the Christians all over India
came up with their own political demands, which added
a new dimension to Indian politics. The new dimension was
that while the leaders of the different communities were
unanimous in the matter of power being transferred to
Indians, they were at loggerheads with each other on the
nature of the new administrative set up.

An interesting fact was that both these were going on
in a parallel way. The _Swaraj Party_ continuously raised
the "national demand" in the Central legislature. They
demanded replacement of the administration by officials who
were not responsible to the people by a government of
people's representatives. In the provincial legislatures they
opposed the Government by every legitimate means and tried
to vote out the budgets. In Bengal and in the Central
Provinces they were even able to defeat the governments.

It was in these circumstances that Gandhi began his
fast in September 1924. Leaders of different parties and
communities met at Delhi to discuss the possibility of bringing
about peace and amity among communities, particularly
between the Hindus and Muslims. But the conference could
not come to any conclusion on the points of dispute. The
discussions revealed that the main issue of dispute was the
proposed _constitutional reforms_ and the position the different
communities would have in the new set up. Following
this, a conference was held on 23rd January 1925 under Gandhi's
chairmanship and appointed two sub-committees. The
task of one was to draw up a clear picture of the national
demand of _Swaraj_. This committee had to decide the form
of the future administrative set up. The task of the second
sub-committee was to examine the issues of dispute between
the Hindus and Muslims and suggest solutions to them. Thus,
a political situation came into being in which the controversial
issues such as processions in front of mosques and cow
slaughter were interwoven with the difference of opinion over
the share each community should have in _Swaraj_.

The _Lucknow Pact_ of 1916 solved the issues of dispute
which had cropped up in the first decade after the formation
of the _Muslim League_. The understanding arrived at on the
question of sharing power between the Hindus and Muslims
formed the basis of the Pact. But the disputes that existed in
the years 1924--1925 were not confined to the Hindus and
Muslims. The agitations conducted by the Muslims in an
organized manner which compelled the government to
concede their demands led the Sikh and Christian religious
communities as well as the lower caste groups among the
Hindus, including the depressed castes, to organize similar
agitations to win their own demands. Besides, the agitation of 1924--25 for national demands was many times more powerful
than that of 1916. The relentless and uncompromising battle
put up by Motilal Nehru, Vithalbhai Patel and others in the
Central legislature and CR Das and others in provincial legislatures
brought pressures on the British government. It
became evident that without offering something substantial,
it was impossible for the British to continue the rule as before.
In other words, it was in a situation in which most people were
convinced that a democratic set up was going to be a reality
very soon that the leaders of the different communities raised
the demands of their respective communities.

The British government resorted to a tactic cleverly utilizing
the situation in which the _bourgeois_ nationalists in India
have always got themselves enmeshed. The clearest manifestation
of this was the statement made by the Secretary of State
for India, Lord Birkenhead, in the British Parliament, which
the political leaders and newspapers of those days called
"Birkenhead's Challenge". Birkenhead stated:

>To talk of
India as an entity is as absurd as to talk of Europe as an
entity. Yet the very nationalist spirit which has created most
of our difficulties in the last few years is based on the aspirations
and claims of a nationalist India. There has never been
such a nation.

Describing at length the different religious communities
inhabiting India and denying her nationhood, he declared:
"If we withdraw from India tomorrow, the immediate consequences
would be a struggle _a outrance_... between the Muslim
and Hindu population." He challenged the Indian leaders
who criticized the British government to "produce a constitution
which carries behind it a fair measure of general agreement
among the great people of India". Confident of the impossibility
of such an exercise, Birkenhead boasted that they
would fulfil the obligation to the Indian people "of whom
we are the responsible guardians".

As the statement makes it clear, the actions of the British
government were governed by the knowledge of the
complexities of the problems faced by the Indian national
leaders and the confidence that the national leaders would
not be able to formulate a plan acceptable to the people and
leaders of the various religious communities, on the one
hand, and the difficulty in rejecting India's national demand
for a _responsible government_, on the other.

This naturally created a stir among the national leaders
who were to give a fitting reply to 'Birkenhead's challenge'.
The _Swaraj_ sub-committee and the Hindu-Muslim unity
committee formed at the conference convened in the wake
of Gandhi's fast began to function with increased vigour and
vigilance leading to an _all-parties conference_, the appointment
of a committee headed by Motilal Nehru to draw a blueprint
for India's constitution, the _Motilal Nehru Report_ and
other developments. We shall deal with these developments
later on. But here it is relevant to cite the observation made
by Gandhi on Birkenhead's challenge. Gandhi stated:

>Lord Birkenhead thinks the British Government are trustees
>of our welfare. We think they hold us in bondage
>for their benefit.
>
>His lordship says we cannot be a nation with our 9
>religions and 130 languages. We contend that for all
>practical purposes and for protection from outside, we are
>one nation. He thinks that _non-cooperation_ was a dreadful
>mistake. The vast majority of us think it alone
>awakened this sleeping nation from its torpor, it alone
>gave the nation a force whose strength is beyond measure.
>Birkenhead thinks that in Hindu-Muslim dissensions, the
>British Government kept its hand unsullied. It is the earnest
>belief of almost every Indian that the British Government
>are principally responsible for these quarrels.
>Birkenhead thinks we must cooperate with them.
>Deshbandhu has shown the way out. His offer stands.

Making it explicitly clear that such a cooperation can
only be on the basis of equality, Gandhi concluded:

>Let us gather that force, the _non-violent_ force of civil
resistance, and we shall be equal. This is no threat, no
menace, It is a hard fact.

That is, Gandhi perceived the caste-communal politics
including the Hindu-Muslim dissensions as part of the political
struggle against the British rule. Gandhi, like all other nationalists
including the _Swarajists_, thought in terms of solving
the Hindu-Muslim problem taking it an integral part of the
struggle to win independence.

Insofar as the _anti-British_ struggle, Gandhi's outlook
suffered from serious weaknesses and contradictions as was
the case with the outlook of other nationalists. That affected
the Hindu-Muslim issue as well. In later chapters, we shall
see that these weaknesses and contradictions were manifested
throughout the period beginning with the 1925--26 all-parties
discussions and ending with the partition of India in 1947. Here,
we will only point to the fact that MN Roy who was handling
the Indian problems on behalf of the _Communist International_,
was able to point to them right in 1925 through the articles
written by him. In the April 1925 issue of the _Masses_,
Roy published an article sharply criticizing the constitution
of the _all-parties committee_ formed under Gandhi's leadership
and its attitudes. He categorically asserted in the
article that the millions consisting of Hindus and Muslims
belonged to the same class and that it was the _bourgeois_
political leaders who were making them fight against each
other

>The developing consciousness of the masses of India
will give the lie to the disunion that is sown among them in
the name of religion by the hand of maulanas and swamis
(of the Hindu-Muslim unity committee), acting as the agents
of the existing social system of oppression and exploitation.

Let it be noted here that it was because of the continuation
of the situation that prevailed in 1925--26 to which Roy
pointed, that India was partitioned in 1947 and many leaders
like Swami Sradhanand (1926) and _Mahatma Gandhi_ (1948)
were assassinated.

## DISSENSIONS AND UNITY IN _BOURGEOIS_ POLITICS

The _Swaraj Party_ which emerged as a result of the split
in the Congress in the wake of the withdrawal of _non-cooperation_
was functioning with the perspective of transforming
the legislature into a platform of struggles. Accordingly,
the _Swarajists_ were striving to use the legislature in such a
way as to give expression to the _anti-imperialist_ feelings of
the people by staging walkouts frequently in the legislature,
voting out budgets and other official motions and boycotting
official members and the functions sponsored by them.

However, a change began to appear in this approach.
The opinion that it was futile to pursue such a policy began
to emerge among the leaders of the _Swaraj Party_ leading to
dissensions in the party, itself the offspring of dissensions
in the Congress.

We have already referred to the efforts made by CR
Das in his last days to move along the path of negotiations
with the tacit approval of Gandhi. Even at that time, Das
used the floor of the legislature as though the _Swarajists_ had
not given up the anti-government posture. After the demise
of Das, Motilal Nehru and other leaders continued to pursue
the same approach. In other words, the style of the parliamentary
work of the _Swaraj Party_ contained the vestiges of
Gandhian _non-cooperation_.

A section discontented with this policy emerged within
the _Swaraj Party_. The growth of this section and the subsequent
dissension in the Party became acute with the death
of CR Das. Therefore, some historians wrongly ascribe
the division in the Party to his death.

Earlier, we had referred to the time marked by the end
of the 'Tilak era' and the beginning of the 'Gandhian era'
in the Indian politics. It was the time when differences
arose between Tilak and Gandhi on the approach to be
adopted in relation to the 1919 reforms. Tilak soon died
and Gandhi emerged as the unquestioned leader of the
national movement. Tilak advocated the policy of conditional
(responsive) cooperation to the British, whereas Gandhi
stood for _non-cooperation_ with the authorities as part of the
struggle to achieve the objective. When these approaches
came to a clash with each other in the background of the 1920--21 mass upheaval, the Gandhian approach and method
of struggle gained upper hand, attracting even the followers
of Tilak to the camp of Gandhi. Tilak had the foresight
to perceive that things were taking shape in that direction.

However, the spirit of _non-cooperation_ continued to
persist in the new form of using the legislature forum for
the anti-government struggle. Besides, making it clear that
work in the legislature was only a partial, temporary function
of the Congress, it maintained itself as an organization
preparing for a confrontation with the Government in the
form of _direct action_. The _Spinners' Association_ and other
organizations based on the Gandhian "_constructive programmes_"
functioned to serve as tools for this purpose.

This was, however, not acceptable to the former 'Tilakites'.
They continued to assert that the _non-cooperation_
programme was a failure of Gandhism and that the only
course of wisdom was '_responsive cooperation_' as advocated
by Tilak. But this was not acceptable not only to the followers
of Gandhi but also to the majority in the _Swaraj Party_.
These differences brought the Party to an open split within
a few months after the death of CR Das in June 1925.
Generally speaking, the disillusionment that grew among the
leaders of the _Swaraj Party_ and the consequent thought of
the need to have a reconsideration of the policies being
pursued brought the Party to the split.

It may be recalled that the disillusionment among
those who had participated in the _non-cooperation_ started
with the perspective of "_Swaraj_ in one year" led to the
formation of the _Swaraj Party_. A feeling began to spread
rapidly that the _Swaraj Party_ too failed to achieve anything
substantial in the course of two or three years of its existence.

The iron fist of the British authorities started moving
against the _Swarajists_ who had given up the _boycott_ of the
legislature. The authorities alleged that they had links
with the revolutionaries including those who were engaged
in 'bomb-politics' and rendered assistance to them in their
revolutionary activities. It was a fact that the _Swarajists_
and the revolutionaries were equally opposed to the Gandhian
form of struggle. Thus, the measures being taken by the
Government purportedly to "curb violent activities" fell on
the _Swarajists_ and the followers of the Gandhian form of
struggle as well. The struggle the _Swarajists_ waged in the
legislature against these repressive measures apparently
failed.

Besides, the arguments put forward by the _Swaraj Party_
leadership on the floor of the legislature for the national
demand of a _responsible governments_ at the centre and in the
provinces turned out to be a cry in the wilderness. Two
trends of thought emerged in the _Swaraj Party_ as to how the
new situation should be met. Representing one of these
trends, Motilal Nehru introduced a resolution at the Kanpur
session of the Congress held in December 1925. The resolution
stated:

>In case no decision is announced on the terms of
the settlement offered to the Government by the Independent
and _Swarajya_ Parties of the assembly by the resolution passed
on the 18th February 1924, before the end of February1926,
the Party shall... intimate to the Government on the floor of
the House that the Party will no longer continue to remain
and work in the present legislatures as heretofore.

Needless to say, the resolution smacked of the vestige
of the Gandhian form of struggle. Malaviya introduced an
alternative resolution suggesting that the work in the
legislatures should be such that it should be most useful to
achieve expeditiously a fully _responsible government_. Cooperate
when it was necessary to win the national demand; adopt
a policy of obstruction when it was necessary.

Speaking in support of this resolution, MR Jayakar
announced that since he had serious differences with the
policies of the _Swaraj Party_, he along with NC Kelkar
and BS Moonje, had already resigned the membership in
the legislature. Jayakar advocated a definite policy of either
completely boycotting the legislatures or "occupying every
place of power, initiative and responsibility and giving no
quarters to the bureaucracy".

Clearly, this was the logical extension of the path
proposed by Tilak. The path of Tilak was now a thing of
the past. The resolution introduced by Malaviya with the
support of Jayakar and others was rejected by the Congress
and Nehru's resolution was adopted with a majority of votes.

The result was a split both in the Congress and in the
_Swaraj Party_. Those who advocated the line of _responsive
cooperation_ formed a party of their own. Besides, Jayakar,
Kelkar and Moonje, who had announced their resignation
from the _Swaraj Party_ at Kanpur itself, Lajpat Rai, Malaviya
and some others also joined the new party. The
communal-caste politicians who had earlier left the Congress
or were working against the Congress joined hands with the
new party and opposed and defeated the "obstructionist
policy" of the _Swaraj Party_. These assorted groups formed
ministries in a number of provinces. In the background of
these developments, the Congress session held in Gauhati
towards the end of 1926 gave up the "obstructionist policy"
which had been pursued by the _Swaraj Party_.

It became clear, however, that the path advocated by
Tilak was as futile as the Gandhian path of struggle as well
as the "obstructionist policy" of the _Swarajists_. The different
sections of the _bourgeois_ national leadership became
one in holding the view that as long as differences existed
among themselves and as long as caste-religious politics
continued to exist, both the Tilak path and the Gandhian
path would remain equally futile. All of them understood
that they would have to remain united, if they were to face
the British policy manifested through the arrogance contained
in the 'Birkenhead challenge' and through the repressive
policy to which they were subjected in one way or the other.
That was why they came forward, as a response to the
Birkenhead challenge, to convene an _all-parties conference_
and appoint an _all-parties committee_ with a view to find a
solution to the problems created by the religious-caste
politics.

It may be recalled that when a similar situation arose
in 1916, the _bourgeois_ leadership tried to face the British
rulers unitedly by arriving at an understanding among themselves
and between the Congress and the _Muslim League_.
The same effort was repeated in a way towards the end of
the 1920s.

But, in a decade, the country had witnessed considerable
changes. The _bourgeoisie_ as a class had become much
stronger. It had displayed the ability to conduct big struggles
by rallying the millions around it and to use the floor of the
legislature to strengthen the struggle outside. At the same
time, the working class politics too, though in its infancy,
had entered the scene and there were indications of the
coming clash between the _bourgeois_ politics and the working
class politics. Though with low level of political consciousness,
organizations of the working class, the peasantry and
other exploited classes were emerging and agitations and
struggles had begun to break out under the leadership of
these organizations. It was in this background that the
_bourgeois_ leadership was dealing with the national issues,
including the question of communal-caste politics.

This circumstance led to the manifestation of dissensions
among the different sections of the _bourgeois_ national leadership
in simultaneous with unity among them, surpassing the
dissensions. We have already described the concrete forms of
these dissensions. The split in the Congress and the further
split in the break away _Swaraj Party_; one section of the
Congress leadership joining the _Hindu Mahasabha_ and
another section joining the Muslim communal organizations;
the emergence of the various parties and organizations representing
other religious minorities and _non-Caste Hindus_ --- these
were the manifest forms of dissensions and splits in
_bourgeois_ politics.

However, there was one demand raised unitedly by the
_bourgeois_ national leaders above the different forms of these
dissensions, the demand that the next step in the constitutional
reform must be granting _responsible government_ equivalent
to the Dominions within the British Empire, like Canada
and Australia, in status.

None of the religious-communal parties and groups
raising dispute with the Congress over the share of their
respective communities after winning this demand had any
dispute with the Congress over the question of getting at
least the _Dominion Status_. Nor was there a dispute between
the 'moderates' inside and outside the Congress over this
issue. The Gandhians within the Congress and the _Swarajists_
were unanimous on this issue.

For the first time the _bourgeoisie_ was entering into
politics with a clear declaration of objective. It did not
dare to make such a clear declaration of objective in 1905--1906 or in 1916--1917. The change that came about in
Indian politics as a result of the Gandhian method of struggle
and the obstructionist policy pursued later by the
_Swaraj Party_ provided the _bourgeoisie_ this courage.

## TOWARDS '_FULL INDEPENDENCE_'

A considerable section was emerging in the Congress
dissatisfied with the demand of _self-rule_ in the sense of
_Dominion Status_ raised by the _bourgeois_ political leadership
of the Congress and the _Swaraj Party_. According to them,
_Dominion Status_ was inadequate. They wanted India to
become a free country independent of the British empire and
began to raise the slogan of _Purna Swaraj_, "_Full Independence_".
It also became clear that the Congress would split
on this issue and that the revolutionaries outside the Congress
would unite with the advocates of _Full Independence_ against
_Dominion Status_ demanded by the right-wing Congress leaders
and leaders of other _bourgeois_ parties. This contradiction
in objective and the resultant inner-party conflicts will be
dealt with later. However, it is necessary here to examine
briefly the circumstances that gave rise to these developments.

One of the results of the Gandhian struggle adopted by
the Congress was that it inspired the middle and poor sections
of the people to enter into the _anti-imperialist_ struggle. The
disappointment that grew generally among the _Congressmen_
over the usefulness of this form of struggle and the political
developments that followed did not affect this popular
struggle. A new generation emerged within and outside the
Congress convinced of the need to adopt forms of struggle,
Gandhian or otherwise, under the leadership of the Congress
and Gandhi or by forming new parties and organizations
for the purpose. Besides, an organized trade union
movement, widespread peasant agitations and struggles,
though not as organized as the working class movement, and
the organized activities of Communists and Socialists who
were trying to give a left-wing revolutionary orientation to
these movements and struggles became the characteristic
features of Indian politics.

Looking from a class point of view, it can be seen that
the foundations for all these were laid by the discontent of
the worker and peasant masses and their organizational consciousness.
In other words, these were germinated by the
intensity of the exploitation by the British imperialism and
the capitalists and landlords under its aegis together with the
mass indignation against it.

The leftists who were fighting for _full independence_ had
the support of even a section of the _bourgeoisie_. Its leaders
like Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, Sreenivasa
Iyengar and others were given wide publicity in the _bourgeois_
press. Even Motilal Nehru and other advocates of _Dominion
Status_ tried to placate the leftist _Congressmen_ advocating
_full independence_.

As a natural consequence of this, the Congress session
held in Madras 1.2 1927 declared '_full independence_' as its
final objective. Two years later, Jawaharlal Nehru was elected
president of the Congress at its Lahore session. The relevant
question here is: why was it that the right-wing Congress
leaders like Motilal Nehru, with Gandhi's blessings, joined
hands with the 'moderates' outside the Congress to win at least
the _Dominion Status_ on the one side, and attempted to placate
the left-wing _Congressmen_ demanding _full independence_, on
the other? In order to find an answer to this question, it is
necessary to examine the changes Indian economy had undergone
in the 1920s.

The position of British monopoly capitalists in India had
started showing weakness as a result of the problems Britain
had been facing during the war and in the years immediately
following the war. However, they were able to regain the
old position during the years 1923--1927. In the year 1926--27,
the British capital investment in India was 574.9 million
pounds, which increased to 1000 million pounds in 1928--29.

They could also control vast economic sectors of industries
and commerce worth many times their capital investment
by means of managing agencies and other systems.
They exercised wide control over banking and foreign trade.
Above all, because of their influence in the Central-provincial
governments in India, they could establish domination
over irrigation and plantations run on capitalist lines.

On the other side, the Indian capitalists also were growing.
In 1923, the number of factories in India was 5,144
which increased to 7,515 by 1927. Some of them were Indian
owned and others were British. It was only natural that the
Indian capitalists tried to change the proportion in their
favour while the British tried to maintain it in their favour.
In this competition, the government tried to take an attitude
helpful to the British capitalists, while the _bourgeois_ parties,
including the Congress, tried to tilt the balance in favour of
the Indian capitalists.

In this struggle between two sections of _bourgeoisie_ --- foreign
and national --- several issues of national importance
came up. The issues like the protection to Indian industrialists
from imports were hotly debated inside the Central legislature
and outside. In all these, the non-official members, including
the _Congressmen_, were anxious to protect the interests of
Indian capitalists, while the official members stood for British
interests.

Here an important issue deserves special mention. The
question concerns the parity of exchange between Indian
rupee and the British pound. The government decided to fix
the parity at Rs. 13.33, per pound instead of the prevailing rate
of Rs 15. The Indian capitalists pointed out that this was a
step detrimental to them. Hence, the _Congressmen_ and the
'moderates' outside the Congress opposed this move both
inside and outside the Central legislature.

Similarly, many issues pertaining to the interests of
Indian industrialists including that of protection to the steel
industry, came up. In all these, all the _bourgeois_ parties,
including the Congress, relentlessly fought for the interests
of the Indian capitalists. All these concrete issues together
led the _bourgeois_ political leadership to demand at least the
_Dominion Status_ for India.

However, it became clear that even if the entire _bourgeois_
leadership worked together for a minimum programme
to win _Dominion Status_, the British government was not
willing to concede it. The _Swaraj Party_ and the Congress
deplored the government for spurning the offer of cooperation
extended by CR Das during his last days. Hopes
were once again aroused when the Viceroy Lord Reading was
replaced by the "largehearted" Lord Irwin. The hopes reached
their zenith when Irwin called many political leaders, including
Gandhi, for a discussion. But they were soon belied.
According to Pattabhi Sitaramayya, the historian of the
_Indian National Congress_, the first week of November 1927
was turbulent. The Viceroy on tour cancelled his programme
and returned to Delhi. Letters were sent to all the prominent
leaders inviting them to meet him according to their convenience
after 5th November. It was clear that the Viceroy had
something important to convey. Gandhi received the invitation
while he was in Mangalore. He cancelled his programme
and immediately proceeded to Delhi. But the talk between
them was held in a lukewarm atmosphere. Lord Irwin only
gave him a copy of the statement made by the Secretary of
State for India announcing the appointment of _Simon
Commission_ to enquire and report on the _constitutional reforms_.
Gandhi wondered if it was for this that he was called
to Delhi to which the Viceroy's answer was a plain "yes".
Gandhi said that if that was the case, he would have got it
had it been sent in a one _anna_ postal envelope.

The Congress, the _Swarajists_ and all other _bourgeois_
parties demanded a decisive share for the Indians in drafting
a new constitution with _self-rule_ no less than that of _Dominion
Status_. The appointment of the _Simon Commission_
represented a rejection of this national demand --- for the
Commission was packed exclusively with Englishmen. On the
basis of the Commission's report it was for the British
government and parliament to decide the future form of the
government in India. The Indian _bourgeoisie_ was disturbed
in that it would have no role in the process of deciding the
future administrative set up which was to handle monetary,
tariff and taxation issues in which their interests always
clashed with that of the British. It was convinced of the fact
that the contradiction between them on the one hand and the
British capitalists and the government on the other was not
easy to resolve and that it would have to rally the entire
masses behind it if they had to resolve the contradiction.

Even at this stage, Motilal Nehru and other right-wing
Congress leaders were striving to resolve the problem by
putting forward the 'moderate' demand of _Dominion Status_
and holding skillful negotiations with the authorities. In this,
they had the blessings of Gandhi. At the same time they
were doubtful if they would be able to win this 'moderate'
demand by "skillful negotiations" alone. Consequently, they
realized that it would be necessary to give shape to another
mass movement like the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_ movements.

The Gandhian "_constructive programmes_" and the organization
based on these programmes constituted one of the
weapons for this purpose in the armoury of the _bourgeoisie_.
But there was a large section of people inside and outside the
Congress who were not likely to get attracted by such programmes
and organizations. They were the young revolutionary
activists with an outlook different from that of the
'moderates' and the followers of Tilak and Gandhi. This
section included the small but energetic _Communist Party_,
the numerous revolutionary groups connected with it or
independent of it, and tens of thousands of militant Congress
workers who had entered politics in response to the call given
by the Congress during the _non-cooperation_ period but,
while remaining still in the Congress, were working hand in
hand with the revolutionaries outside. The main link unifying
all these sections was the preparation that was being
made to organize a countrywide struggle to win the declared
objective of _full independence_.

As the announcement with regard to the appointment of
the _Simon Commission_ was made towards the end of 1927,
even the most 'moderate' of the _bourgeois_ leaders became
discontent. The right-wing Congress leaders were convinced
that the Government in Britain could not satisfy even the
'moderates'. Accordingly, the Madras session of the Congress
in December 1927 took two important decisions, one of
which was the declaration of _full independence_ as its ultimate
aim. The Congress thus adopted the spirit of the resolution
moved by Maulana Hazrat Mohani which it had rejected at
the Ahmedabad session six years ago.

However, to the right-wing _Congressmen_ this was a
short time tactic designed to win the support of the leftist
_Congressmen_ and the revolutionary masses in their attempt
to win the immediate demand of _Dominion Status_. This was
evident from their later moves. As for Gandhi, he stated
in public that the discussion on the resolution held in the
Madras session had "no more value than that of the debating
society of school children".

But, more important was another resolution passed at
the Madras session which stated:

>Whereas the British Government
have appointed the Statutory (Simon) Commission in utter
disregard of India's right of _self-determination_, this Congress
resolves that the only self-respecting course for India to
adopt is to _boycott_ the Commission at every stage and in
every form.

Accordingly, the Congress decided to organize protest
demonstrations all over India on the day of the arrival to the
_Simon Commission_ and to persuade other parties, organizations
and members of the Central-provincial legislatures
not to cooperate with the Commission in its work. It directed
the Congress members of the Central-provincial legislatures
to maintain their membership but, at the same time, make
the _boycott_ effective and attend the legislature only when
necessary.

Thus, the _boycott_ programme which was withdrawn
following the _Chauri Chaura_ incident was revived in a new
form. Even the right-wing Congress leaders realized that
they would be able to bargain with the authorities only in
the background of mass enthusiasm created by such a
movement and that if the bargaining failed, they would have
to launch once again a mass movement as they did in the 1920s.
The Madras session was the reflection of this realization.
