# THE _SALT SATYAGRAHA_

## BACKGROUND OF ECONOMIC CRISIS

To understand the political developments described in the
last few sections and those to be dealt with in the following
sections in their full import, it is essential to take a look at
the world-wide economic crisis that appeared towards the
late 1920s and the early 1930s.

It must be noted that the term "world-wide" employed
here in relation to economic crisis is not entirely correct,
because there was one country in the world which was free
from this crisis --- the USSR. Not only was there no crisis
but the economic reconstruction there was progressing with
amazing rapidity.

The developed capitalist countries like Britain, the USA,
France, Germany, Japan, etc., as well as the backward,
exploited countries including India were equally engulfed in
a deep and widespread crisis. Absolutely free from this, the
economic system of a country which had hitherto remained
backward, was being modernized and growing at an amazing
speed.

Here we need not go into the question of how this
affected the capitalist world in general, nor into the details
of its economic impact on India. The relevant question is
how it affected the feelings and emotion of the Indian people
in general and the different classes in particular. Here we
will deal with the question only to the extent it helps us to
explain how the _anti-imperialist_ mass feeling which had been
swelling for the last few years, how the left political forces
which were striving to give an organized form to this feeling
and how the Congress leadership which was striving to come
to a compromise with the rulers from a _rightist_ stand-point
as opposed to the left got crystallized.

As indicated earlier, it was a crisis of unprecedented
depth, which affected simultaneously all capitalist countries,
whether developed or underdeveloped. It was characterized as
the "crisis of production", because foodgrains and consumer
articles produced in factories piled up with no buyers. To
save themselves from the consequent fall in prices, the
capitalists were ready to destroy a considerable part of the
goods produced by dumping them into the sea or by burning
them.

But, it was not because there were no people who were
in need of these articles, but the people who were in need of
them had no money to buy them. Production above the
purchasing power of the consumers --- this is what is meant
by "over-production". As a result of this crisis, factories
were closed and farms were left fallow. Because of the
policy of the capitalists to maintain the rate of profit by
cutting down production, unemployment increased and the
wages of those employed fell. As a result, the purchasing
power of the potential buyers reduced further.

All these happened in India as well just as in the imperial
countries including Britain. Production fell both in
industry and agriculture. The prices of goods produced too
fell sharply. Small farmers and artisans could not get a fair
price for the goods they produced, while their burden of tax
and debt increased. At the same time, the prices of industrial
goods needed for their daily use did not fall to the
same extent as the fall in the prices of agricultural produce.
For all these reasons, they were pauperized.

The land of the small and middle peasants and the capital
investments of artisans and small businessmen were either
mortgaged or sold.

Closure, retrenchment, and cut in wages were widespread
in industries. A huge army of unemployed job-seekers rose
in towns and villages, consisting of people coming out of
educational and training institutions, workers retrenched
from factories and those who lost their land and trade.

The unrest and discontent that arose out of these conditions
formed the basis for the mass upsurge witnessed
towards the end of the 1920s. The news coming from the
Soviet Union where a new system free from such hardships
was being built up, made the people sit up and think.

This was what led to the growth of leftist ideology, an
inclination towards Socialism, though vague as it was, among
the younger generation. The propaganda conducted by
Jawaharlal Nehru in favour of Socialism and the Soviet
Union, the dissent expressed by leaders like Subhas Bose
and Jawaharlal too, with the compromising attitude of the
Congress leadership including Gandhi --- all these were the
reflections of the new left wind that had begun to blow over
India.

The world capitalist crisis not only imposed new burdens
on the labouring masses like the peasants and workers, but
also led to a serious political crisis in the entire capitalist
world. In the atmosphere of a shrinking market for agricultural
and industrial products, capitalist powers began to
compete with each other to grab as much of the market as
possible. Japan, Germany and the USA tried to push
England back from her position as the leading capitalist force
in the world, while England fought back to maintain her
position.

As an inseparable part of the competition between the
different capitalist powers and between different _bourgeois_
groups in each capitalist country, the imperial powers like
Britain began to tighten their grip on colonies like India.
As a result, new burdens were imposed not only on the poor
and middle classes in towns and countryside but also on
landlords and capitalists. Thus, the latter too were forced
to take _anti-imperialist_ positions to some extent, that is, in a
way that would not be detrimental to their narrow class
interests.

In many of the documents prepared by the Congress
leadership, including the letters written by Gandhi to the
Viceroy, one can see the deep concern at and protest against
the sacrifice of the interests of Indian capitalists for the
benefit of the British capitalists. The parity of the rupee
and the British pound, tariff regulations favouring the British
capitalists, ships used for export and import of goods, etc.,
became issues for sharp criticism. On all these issues, the
liberals outside the Congress and leaders like Jinnah who
was engaged in caste-communal politics favoured the position
taken by the Congress. The attempts made by the rulers to
use India as the milch cow for the British capitalists and the
resistance of the nationalists against them were found reflected
in these issues.

In the background of the economic crisis that affected
the entire capitalist world, the rulers of India put forward
a proposal which intensified these problems. The proposal
was to accord to Britain the most favoured treatment in the
matter of import duties. That is, British imports into
India would attract a lower duty compared as to those from
Japan, Germany, etc. This policy, known as "_Imperial Preference_",
came to sharp criticism from the Congress as well
as the liberals.

Former _Congressmen_ under the leadership of Malaviya
and Dewan Chamanlal had kept themselves aloof from the
decision to launch the _Salt Satyagraha_ and Gandhi's Dandi
march. They were continuing as members of the Central
Assembly defying the directive of the Congressmen to resign
from all elected bodies. It was at a time when the entire
country was discussing the _Salt Satyagraha_ and the _Dandi
March_ that the Bill on _Imperial Preference_ was introduced in
the Central legislature. Pandit Malaviya, Dewan Chamanlal
and others strongly opposed the _Imperial Preference_ and
moved amendments to it. Following the defeat of their
amendments they staged a walk out and resigned from the
legislature. The president of the Assembly, Vithalbhai Patel
too resigned along with them and declared his intention to
participate in the _civil disobedience movement_.

These developments showed that the contradiction
between British and Indian capitalists got intensified as a
natural consequence of the crisis that had affected the entire
capitalist world. This also explains why the right wing
Congress leaders like Gandhi and Motilal Nehru joined
hands with the left wing _Congressmen_ like Jawaharlal Nehru
and Subhas Bose and gave a call for a mass struggle
against the British rulers.

There was another important issue which deserves special
mention here. The competition between the British, on the
one hand, and other imperialist powers like Germany and
Japan, on the other, compelled Britain to take an attitude
different from what they had hither to been following with
regard to industrialization of India. India was one of the
important markets for the British industrial goods. The
imperialist powers like Japan were striving to capture it.
Hence, it was necessary for the British to protect the Indian
market from encroachment by the rival powers. At the same
time, it was also necessary for them to provide facilities to
British capitalists for increased capital investment in India.
It was with these twin objectives that the British adopted
the policy of _Imperial Preference_. This helped industrialization
of India to some extent. It also helped the British
capitalists to compete with Indian capitalists.

During the 1929--33 economic crisis, a number of new
industrial units came up in India, while the old ones were
further expanded. For example, the textile industry which
had developed on a large scale in Bombay and Ahmedabad
was extended to Madras. The sugar industry which was non-existent
till then began to grow in a big way. Cement and
other industries also began to grow during the same period.

A part of these industries was under British ownership.
The British realized that, while protecting India from the
attack of the capitalist rivals like Germany and Japan, the
best way to continue to use India as the milch cow was to
establish new industries in India under British ownership. This
approach which the British capitalists adopted to save themselves
from the growth of the Indian capitalists led to an
intensification of the contradiction between them and the
Indian capitalists.

During this period, a number of new industrial units
under Indian ownership too had sprung up. Among these,
the sugar industry deserves special mention. Till then, sugar
from Jawa was being imported into India. As such, the
British had nothing to lose if sugar industry developed here
even if it was under Indian ownership. On the contrary,
as a natural corollary to the growth of the sugar mills,
sugar-cane cultivation would develop yielding income to the
landlords and rich peasants engaged in its cultivation. This
was politically advantageous to the British. The consolidation
of the relation between the elites in the countryside
and the owners of sugar mills would help the maintenance
and growth of British influence in India.

Thus, utilizing the protective tariff against Jawa sugar,
Birla, Dalmia, Singhania, Thapar, Narang and others began
to extend their industrial operation to sugar industry. The
surplus of the big landowners in the rural areas was also
ploughed into the sugar industry. That is, landowners who
invested in industries, capitalist farmers who produced raw
materials for industries and the industrial capitalists interested
in the agricultural sector had all joined hands in the task
of modernizing Indian economy on capitalist lines.

This process was not, however, confined to the sugar
industry alone. During the same period, many industries
like cement, leather, _bidi_ and so on came up. Big landowners
and moneylenders entered the industrial sector for the first
time. Thus, '_Imperial Preference_,' introduced by the British
rulers to protect themselves from capitalist rivals like Japan
and Germany, in a sense, helped the growth of Indian capitalists
as well.

At the same time, the British tried to prevent the growth
of Indian capitalists in other areas utilizing the protective
shield of '_Imperial Preference_'. This led to the intensification
of the contradiction between Indian and British capitalists.
The Indian _bourgeoisie_ was guided in general by the self-confidence
gained through investment in certain industrial
sectors and the resentment at the policy of the ruling powers
preventing them from spreading to other sectors.

Along with this was another development which was
equally significant. Among the Indian capitalists who grew
within the limits of '_Imperial Preference_', a small minority
had grown swallowing the assets of small and medium capitalists
who were crushed as a result of the economic crisis.
Though there was common identity between big capitalists,
on the one hand, and the medium and small capitalists, on
the other, as a class, contradiction grew between them as rivals
in the same class. The big capitalists became confident
that they would be able to foster their class interest if they
adopted the twin approach of opposition by all means to the
British capitalists and of negotiation with them at the same
time. For the medium and small scale capitalists competition
from British capitalists was proving extremely dangerous.

In the circumstances, differences in policy and approach
began to arise among the different sections of the Indian
_bourgeoisie_ in conformity with their class interests. One
section thought in terms of an uncompromising struggle against
imperialism in accordance with the feelings of the leftwing
youth and the masses of workers and peasants, while
another section thought in terms of safeguarding, to the
extent possible, their class interest by utilizing every
opportunity of coming to a compromise with the rulers.

There were a number of instances of these two trends
appearing by turn in one and the same group or even the
same individual. But there was one group which continuously
and consistently adhered to the position that no chance
should be lost for a compromise and that was represented by
the Congress leadership consisting of the disciples of Gandhi
and pro-legislaturists. On the other side, there was another
section that stood firm in the path of struggle without any
compromise. It included a variety of individuals and groups
like Communists who had assumed by then an organized
form, the emerging Socialist groups, the left _Congressmen_
like Bose who, unlike Nehru, were not influenced by Gandhism.

The clash between these two groups broke out at different
stages and in different forms with which we shall deal in
the following sections. However, the political characteristic
of the period of the _Salt Satyagraha_ consisted of the fact
that it helped these two groups to stand together.

## FORMS OF STRUGGLE: GANDHIAN AND NON-GANDHIAN

The _salt satyagraha_ was launched on 6th April 1930.
As pointed out earlier, Gandhi organized his struggle subject
to severe restrictions. But, because of the emotion-charged
situation, the forms of struggle that people resorted to all
over the country violated the restrictions imposed by him.

Although the ritual violation of the salt law under
Gandhi's leadership was performed on 6th April as scheduled,
Gandhi was left free until 5th May. In between, almost all
leaders except Gandhi were imprisoned. Vallabhbhai Patel
was arrested in the course of the Dandi march itself. After
the Satyagragha was launched, all top Congress leaders,
including Jawaharlal Nehru, were put behind the bars. And
as the _Salt Satyagraha_ spread all along the seacoast following
the _Satyagraha_ launched by Gandhi, the volunteers as
well as the spectactors were subjected to unprecedented police
brutality.

Protesting against these, _hartals_, strikes and demonstrations
were held all over the country. The movement received
wide publicity in the country and abroad. Although there
was strict control on newspapers and other publications in
India, the arrests, police repression and protest demonstrations,
etc., got publicity to a considerable extent. Since
Gandhi was free, the statements issued by him encouraged
the protest demonstrations. He was determined to see that
the struggle remained within the limits set by him. This
was reflected in all his statements.

Realizing that he would not be allowed to remain outside
the jail for long, Gandhi issued a number of statements elaborating
how the struggle should be conducted in his absence.
The last among them, issued just a few hours before his
arrest, was a follows:

>Let not my companions or the people at large be perturbed
over my arrest, for it is not I but God who is guiding the
movement. ... Our path has already been chalked out for us.
Let every village manufacture or fetch contraband salt, sisters
should picket liquor shops, opium dens and foreign
cloth dealers' shops. Young and old in every home should ply
the _takli_ and spin and get woven heaps of yarn every day.
Foreign cloth should be burnt. Hindus should eschew untochability.
Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, _Parsis_ and Christians
should all achieve heart unity. Let the majority rest content
with what remains after the minorities have been satisfied.
Let the students leave Government schools, and Government
servants resign their service and devote themselves
to service of the people, we shall find that _Purna Swaraj_
will come knocking at our doors.[^14/1]

[^14/1]: GD Tendulkur, _Mahatma_, Vol 3, New Delhi, Publications Division, 1969, p. 32.

However, as Gandhi tried to draw the entire people into
his _non-violent_ struggle, other forms of struggle too were
adopted in many parts of the country. Some incidents may
be cited here to enable us to find the depth and form of
people's fighting spirit.

One such incident was the raid of Chittagong armoury
which took place before Gandhi issued the above statement.
Chittagong town and its surrounding areas(now in Bangladesh)
were the centres of 'bomb-politics'. The armoury raid was
designed to transform the countrywide _anti-imperialist_ fighting
spirit kindled by the call given by Gandhi into a revolutionary
form of struggle as distinct from the Gandhian
method.

The leader of this raid was Surya Sen, known as 'Master
Da' among his followers. By a well-coordinated action, these
revolutionaries were able to cut off the communication links
with the town and capture the police camp. With the captured
arms in their hands, they went around the city singing '_Vande
mataram_'. They also captured all the police stations on their
way and raised barricades to obstruct the movement of the
military. The entire town was under their control for several
days. They succeeded even in derailing a train carrying troops
to quell them.

It was an act which inspired all _anti-imperialists_ not
stunted by commitment to Gandhian philosophy. Many of
those who participated in the raid later became Communists.
But then they did not have the outlook of a working class
revolutionary party for raising a revolutionary army on the
foundations of mass struggles. Besides, they had the notion
that they would be able to defeat the police force and the
army of the British rulers by the courageous actions of a
handful of self-sacrificing brave individuals. Viewed from
this perspective, the Chittagong armoury raid was certainly
the best organized of all the revolutionary programmes carried
out by the politicians who believed in the cult of the bomb.
Having been able to defeat the police force in a town and
prevent the entry of the military, for a short time though it
was, by sheer grit and organization of a few well-trained
young men and women, they set the most inspiring example
for _petty-bourgeois revolutionaries_.

But this had all the weaknesses of the _petty-bourgeois_
revolutionary path. Although they captured all the police
camps in the harbour city of Chittagong, they did not capture
the Chittagong harbour which was a base of the British army
and one of its important communication links, which enabled
the British authorities to deploy easily their forces in the
harbour against the revolutionaries.

In addition to this weakness, which may be termed
technical, they had another weakness which was political in
nature. Theirs was not a revolutionary army which had
organized the workers, peasants and other masses of the
surrounding areas, winning their love and confidence. Therefore,
when they decided to withdraw from the town in the
wake of the arrival of the British army which they could
not resist, they had already become isolated from the people.
Even when the army entered the forests where they had taken
shelter, the revolutionaries in the town and the rural areas
could not organize an _anti-British_ struggle in Chittagong.
This is what distinguishes 'bomb-politics' from the working
class revolutionary methods practised in the national liberation
struggle in Vietnam and in the guerrilla war against
the _Nazi_ hordes. Thus, within a few days, the British were
able to capture the revolutionaries and institute proceedings
against 30 of them. Though the leaders went underground
for almost two years, the organization as a whole collapsed.

The mass upsurge that took place in the North West
Frontier region, now part of Pakistan, was different from
this. In that region, there was no organization of "bomb-politicians"
as in Bengal. The area was inhabited by the
Pathans, the Afridis, the Momandis and other tribes. It was
an uphill task for the British to defeat them and bring them
under their rule. Even after they were defeated, they continued
to organize innumerable resistance struggles against the
British. They took part in a big way in the _anti-imperialist_
struggles during the First World War and in the post-war
years. The new upsurge that swept across the country in the
wake of the _Salt Satyagraha_ also inspired them.

Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, popularly known as the
"Frontier Gandhi", was the most outstanding leader thrown
up in the struggles. The popular upsurge of the Pathans
under his leadership inspired India as a whole. The _Satyagrahis_
who formally belonged to the Congress and the _Khudai
Khidmatgars_ (Servants of God) organized by Ghaffar Khan
joined hands and raised a mass front of _people's struggle_.
(_Khudai Khidmatgars_ was a volunteer organization devoted to
social reform and cultural progress. And they inevitably
became part of the _anti-imperialist_ movement. The colour
of the uniform of the volunteers was white in the beginning,
but taking into consideration the climate of the region, they
changed it to red. Thus, the _Khudai Khidmatgars_ came to
be known as the "_Red Shirts_".)

Viewed from a class point of view the _satyagraha_ struggle
in this region which turned into a mass movement under the
leadership of the Frontier Gandhi, was similar to that in
other parts of India. In the Frontier Province the _satyagraha_
was conducted solely under the leadership of the upper
sections of the society. But the Pathans led by Ghaffar
Khan were able to maintain their tribal fraternity and raise
it to the level of a strong _anti-imperialist_ feeling. Besides,
they were also able to organize the Afridi and the Momandi
tribes on the basis of their tribal fraternity and make them
part of the _anti-imperialist_ political movement. Thus, what
one saw in the N. W. Frontier was an entire people rising
against imperialist domination. And this distinguishes the
mass movement in the N. W. Frontier from the Chittagong
armoury raid.

Just as Gandhi, Ghaffar Khan too tried his best to
keep the struggle _non-violent_. But once the tribals with the
tradition of _anti-imperialist_ struggle entered the field, it was
difficult to keep it _non-violent_. Thus, a demonstration
held in Peshawar under the official leadership of the Congress
ended in a clash with the police. Many Congress leaders
who went to the spot pleading with the demonstrators to
remain _non-violent_ themselves became the target of people's
anger. Disregarding the advice and direction of the leaders,
the people went ahead. In the end, in Peshawar as in many
other parts of India, the armed forces opened fire at the
people.

A particular incident connected with this firing deserves
special mention. That incident provided an indication to
the revolutionary atmosphere that existed in those days.
One of the army units which was ordered to shoot was the
Garhwali tribal battalion, which refused to open fire as they
considered it a cowardly act to fire unarmed people, an act
against their own military tradition. (It must be noted here
that the leader of this Garhwali unit, Chander Singh, later
joined the _Communist Party_ after completing his term of
sentence.)

Though different from the atmosphere of Chittagong
and Peshawar, another demonstration of the _anti-imperialist_
feeling inspired by _Salt satyagraha_ was witnessed in Sholapur
in Maharashtra. As in other provinces, the _satyagraha_ in
Sholapur was organized by an action council under the
leadership of the Congress. Sholapur was a town with a
population of industrial workers, though small in number.
Besides, it was influenced by 'extremist' politics from the time
of Tilak. Consequently, the struggle broke the limits of _non-violence_.
On 28th may a few policemen were killed in a clash
between the police and the people who participated in the
_satyagraha_. The police opened fire at the people in which five
persons were killed and more than a hundred wounded.
Restless at the turn of events, the people threw overboard
the principle of _non-violence_ and turned against the police.
Led by the worker volunteers, the people set fire to six police
stations, a military record room, a number of British offices
and liquor shops (they took particular care to see that the
fire did not spread to the neighbouring residential areas).
Along with the British officers, their trusted men and the
police had to flee the town. With the behaviour of the Garhwali
soldiers in Peshawar fresh in their memory, the authorities
did not send Indian troops to suppress the people of
Sholapur. Instead, they used British troops for the purpose.

The nature of the incident that took place in Sholapur
was different form those that took place in Chittagong and
Peshawar. It was a movement based neither on a handful of
brave adventurists as in Chittagong nor on the tribal fraternal
consciousness as in Peshawar. In Sholapur, the organized
industrial working class, in its primary stage though, a Congress
leadership which was striving to bring them and other
sections of the masses into the struggle,and political conditions
in which 'extremist' politics exercised a stronger influence on
the people including the _Congressmen_ than Gandhism were
all combined in the organized mass movement. It was, in
fact, a pointer to the nature of _freedom struggle_ in the days
to come.

In many other parts of India, the organized working class
responded to the call given by the Congress leadership and fought
vigorously against imperialist domination. They fought
with greater determination and vigour than traders, students
and other sections of the people. As distinct from the 1920--21
period, now the workers had their own exclusive organizations.

The workers in the 1930s had imbibed the experience of
their struggles conducted earlier under the leadership of
these organizations. Sholapur was the forerunner of the
coming country-wide struggles of traders and students in the
towns and of the peasants and other labouring masses in the
countryside.

Two of the three events mentioned here --- Chittagong
and Peshawar --- took place before Gandhi was arrested, which
showed the character of the _anti-imperialist_ movement of those
days. But, Gandhi, who had called off the _non-cooperation_
movement after the _Chauri Chaura_ incident, did not call off
the struggle after Chittagong and Peshawar. After Gandhi's
arrest, the leadership of the Congress outside the jail (the
_Working Committee_) appealed to the people and the Congress
committees at the lower levels to adopt every from of struggle
including a no-tax campaign.

Furthermore, Motilal Nehru who had come out after a
few weeks of imprisonment stated that the people in the
army and the police force were not bound to carry out
illegal orders. The fact that Motilal Nehru, an acclaimed
right wing leader of the Congress, did appeal to follow the
example shown by the Garhwali battalion was a reflection
of the then existing conditions.

In brief, whatever be the intention of Gandhi, the _Salt
Satyagraha_, in effect, turned out to be a programme which
inspired the people to enter the field of struggle. That is,
limitations of the Gandhian theory of struggle was no
hindrance to raising the _Salt Satyagraha_ to the level of a far
wider and better organized struggle than that of the 1920--21
period in which a wider spectrum of people from children
and women who had hitherto been confined to homes and
Hindus, irrespective of caste distinctions, to members of
religious minority communities, took part.

## NEGOTIATIONS

While the people in different parts of the country were
enthusiastically engaged in a glorious struggle, the Congress
leaders at the top and the _bourgeoisie_ which was giving full
support to them were not acting in consonance with the
feelings of the masses.

The capitalists, in general, tried to take advantage of
the struggle including the _boycott_ of foreign cloth. While
millions of people braving the police _lathi-charge_ and firings
were carrying out the _boycott_ of foreign cloth and setting
fire to them, the Indian cotton mill owners did two things.
On the one side, they gave liberal financial support to the
struggle, including the picketing, to ensure the success of the
programme of the _boycott_ of foreign cloth, and on the
other, induced the political workers out of jail to propagate
the use of _Swadeshi_, a programme which was more "practical"
than the programme of _boycott_ of foreign cloth. They reached
an understanding with the Congress leaders that the
latter would not stand in the way of selling the cloth produced
in Indian textile mills.

_Congressmen_ outside jails and _non-Congress_ liberals
began to implement a "constructive" programme in which
the people were to take the pledge of wearing only _Swadeshi_
cloth, while the mill owners were to observe certain conditions
regarding the production of cloth.

Obviously, this was a step capable of serving the interests
of Indian textile mill owners. The programmes of _boycott_ of
foreign cloth directly under the leadership of the Congress
and the programme of propagation of _Swadeshi_ not directly
under Congress leadership together created the necessary
conditions for the protection of the interests of the Indian
mill owners. But the capitalist class was not satisfied with
this alone. It also wanted solution to the political issue in
which the entire capitalist class, including those in the textile
industry, was interested.

The capitalists as a whole desired at least a constitutional
change if not _full independence_ as demanded at the Lahore
session of the Congress. They desired to use the political
atmosphere created by the country-wide struggle in which
hundreds were shot dead and tens of thousands beaten up,
to exert maximum pressure on the British rulers and thereby
acquire as much power as possible. They also wanted the
Congress to adopt a "pragmatic approach" necessary for
this purpose. In other words, they proposed entering into
negotiations with the British rulers, while at the same time,
rallying the entire people in the glorious _anti-imperialist_ struggle.

This was exactly what the Congress leaders, including
Gandhi, were contemplating. It may be recalled here that
within weeks of the adoption of the _full Independence_ resolution
at Lahore Congress --- at a time when the _Independence
Day_ was being observed all over the country in which millions
of people participated --- Gandhi wrote to the Viceroy reducing
_full independence_ to "eleven points" which made the leftist
devotees of Gandhi like Nehru feel uneasy. In all the
subsequent statements issued by Gandhi, in the speeches he
made and in the letters he wrote to the Viceroy during the
_Dandi March_ and after launching the _Salt Satyagraha_, the
approach of conciliation and negotiation was obvious. Just
before and after launching the _Salt Satyagraha_, Gandhi wrote
to the Viceroy saying that he was aware of the dangerous
possibilities inherent in the path of struggle he had adopted
and that since he wanted to avoid it, the government must
adopt a helpful attitude. He persisted in making such
statements till he was arrested on 5th May.

After the arrest, Gandhi could not make such statements
or speeches. But within two weeks of his arrest, he got
an opportunity to reiterate his approach from jail and get
worldwide publicity. The British rulers themselves helped
to create an atmosphere for this.

To understand the import of this development, it is
necessary to elaborate the attitude of the British rulers
towards the struggle. In Britain, as we have noted earlier,
the Conservatives who were in power till 1929 were
replaced by the _Labour Party_ which had been advocating a
policy of conceding India's political rights. (_Labour Party_
leader Clement Atlee who was a member of the _Simon Commission_
had expressed himself in favour of conceding India's
demands.) Besides, many prominent newspapers in Britain
had written editorial articles protesting against the repression
let loose by the government following the _Salt Satyagraha_ and
pleading for a conciliatory attitude towards the Congress.
The newspapers in the USA and other foreign countries,
as also foreign social and political leaders, religious heads
and others, expressed themselves in favour of India's independence
movement. In this international background, the
British government could not pursue a policy of repression
alone. The rulers had to adopt a dual policy of proceeding
legally against the violation of laws, and creating at the same
time the impression that the doors were not closed for
conciliation.

This explains why Gandhi was left free for weeks after
launching the _Salt Satyagraha_. It was for the same reason
that many top leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai
Patel were released immediately after a brief period
of imprisonment.

As part of this policy, a British newspaper correspondent
was allowed to interview Gandhi in jail and ascertain
his views on the terms of a conciliation. And this correspondent
was the representative in India of _Daily Herald_, the
organ of the _British Labour Party_. He had written a number
of articles in his paper expressing sympathy towards the
struggle led by Gandhi.

It was meaningful that a British correspondent with
such a political background was allowed to interview
Gandhi. This was a clear indication that the British _bourgeoisie_
and their government were eager to solve the problem
by negotiations as well as the Indian _bourgeoisie_ and its political
leadership, the Congress. While the latter viewed the
struggle as a means to bring pressure on the British rulers,
the former viewed the repression and the proposal for the
_Round Table Conference_ as instruments to bring pressure
on the Congress. They had made it clear that the Conference
would be held even if the Congress dissociated from it
and that necessary steps would be taken to "protect "law and
order"" if the leadership launched the _civil disobedience_.
While, on the one hand, the authorities took steps to teach
the 'law-breakers' a lesson by perpetrating violence on tens
of thousands of people, they, on the other hand, called the
(first) _Round Table Conference_ in London to which all leaders
excluding _Congressmen_ were invited.

However, both the sides knew that none of these methods
was going to be effective in the final analysis.

The Congress leadership knew that however massive
the _civil disobedience movement_, it would not take them to
the goal of _full independence_ demanded at the Lahore
Congress. Yet, it was not willing to adopt the means and forms
of struggle proposed by left _Congressmen_ and Communists.

Similarly, the British rulers knew that a _round table conference_
without the participation of the Congress could not
solve the political questions of India and also that the _civil
disobedience movement_ could not be suppressed by force.
Hence, the authorities wished to persuade the Congress to
postpone the _civil disobedience movement_ and participate
in the _Round Table Conference_.

The Congress leadership too wished to participate in
the _Round Table Conference_ on the condition that at least
some limited political rights short of _full independence_
demanded by them and taken by the people as their own,
be granted. In fact, the Indian _bourgeoisie_ as a whole expressed
the desire to make such a move.

The foreign friends of India sympathetic to the Indian
freedom movement as well as the liberals in India itself
were wondering if, in the atmosphere of the pressure tactics
exercised by both the sides, a compromise could be brought
about on the basis of terms acceptable to both the sides.

It was in this background that George Slocombe, the
Indian representatives of _Daily Herald_, held a talk with
Gandhi in jail. Slocombe sought to know from Gandhi
the terms on which the Congress would call off the _civil disobedience
movement_ and participate in the _Round Table
Conference_. Gandhi's reply, published in _Daily Herald_ and
in other foreign and Indian papers contained the following
terms:

1. The adoption of a constitution which grants the essence
   of independence to India should be brought
   within the purview of the _Round Table Conference_,
2. Concede the demands put forward by Gandhi with
   regard to the abolition of Salt Tax, Prohibition and
   the ban on foreign cloth.
3. Release all prisoners sentenced on political grounds
   with the suspension of the _Civil Disobedience Movement_.
4. Leave the remaining part of the '11 points' which
   Gandhi had submitted to the Viceroy to future negotiations.

Needless to state, these terms constituted a going back
not only from the Lahore resolution on independence but
also from the position taken by Gandhi in his statements and
in the letters he wrote to the Viceroy. The goal of _full independence_
was reduced to the "essence of independence", and
the majority of the minimum demand of '11-points' set
aside for future negotiations". Slocombe concluded his report
with a warning that unless the authorities were willing to
take the path of conciliation by accepting the very much scaled-down
demand of Gandhi, both England and India would be
caught in "a danger beyond imagination".

But the government was not willing to accept even this.
Hence, the struggle continued. A large number of Congress
committees were declared illegal and their properties, including
Anand Bhavan, the home of the Nehru family in
Allahabad which was donated to the congress when the
disobedience movement was launched, confiscated. Undaunted,
the people in tens of thousands continued the disobedience
programme in different forms in different places. Side by side,
the top leaders of the Congress and the liberals continued
their efforts to negotiate with the government.

On 20th June 1930, Motilal Nehru came out of the prison
after serving his first term of sentence. Before long, Slocombe
held an interview with him following which discussions were
held among Motilal, Slocombe and the liberal leader,
Jayakar. The subject of the discussion was the terms acceptable
to the Congress to participate in the _Round Table Conference_.
The opinions and suggestions that emerged in
these discussions were conveyed in a letter to Sapru. He in turn
approached the Viceroy with that letter. In the light of the
talks held with the Viceroy, Sapru and Jayakar visited
Motilal Nehru, who had been arrested once again, Gandhi
and Jawaharlal Nehru in jail.

The efforts of these two liberal leaders to evolve the
terms acceptable to both sides had the full support of the
Viceroy. Hence, the Nehrus and Dr. Sayed Mohamud were
brought to Yerwada jail where Gandhi had been kept. There,
a conference was held which was attended by Gandhi, the
Nehrus, Vallabhbhai Patel, Dr Mohamud, Jairamdas
Daulatram and Sarojini Naidu. Sapru and Jayakar pleaded
with the Congress leaders to climb down further from the
position taken by Gandhi in his interview with Slocombe.
But Congress leaders could not accept the plea. Some of
them, in fact, were of the opinion that the terms put forward
by Gandhi represented a backpedalling from the goal adopted
by the Congress. Hence, a further climb down from that
position was out of the question. The authorities on their
part were not willing to accept the terms put forward by
Gandhi. Thus, the first negotiation held after the launching
of the _civil disobedience movement_ failed.

There was one important development which needs
special mention here. Before the Yerwada discussion, Gandhi
wrote to the Nehrus in the North Indian jails expressing the
view that the time was not yet ripe for a negotiation. Gandhi
feared that in the then prevailing atmosphere of a countrywide
mass struggle, negotiations with the authorities by a
few leaders would do more harm than good. That is, Gandhi's
intention was to call upon the people to intensify the
struggle against the authorities who were not willing to accept
even the minimum demands put forward by him.

But this made one thing clear. Unlike the Congress
ranks and the people who participated in the struggle, the
Congress leaders were not thinking in terms of a "struggle
till the goal is achieved". Their assessment of the situation
was that there was no alternative but to advance along the
path of struggle for the time being till the time became propitious
for negotiations.

## THE _FIRST ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE_

We have noted earlier that the British government had
decided to hold the _Round Table Conference_ even if the
Congress did not participate in it, as a means to exert pressure
on the Congress. This conference began on 31st October 1930. In all 89 delegates attend it, 16 representing the
different political parties in Britain, 16 representing the
_Princely States_ of India, and 57 from the British Indian
provinces.

Because of the absence of the Congress, the Conference was
held in an atmosphere of unreality. It may be recalled that the
Congress leaders had declared that any decision taken in the
Conference would not be binding on them. Hence, the Prime
Minister Ramsay MacDonald's statement at the concluding
session on 19th January 1931 expressed the hope that those who
were not participating in the _civil disobedience movement_
would accede to the appeal of the Viceroy and participate
in the future proceedings of the Conference. And in expressing
this hope, he was sincere. For the ruling powers were
aware that a fruitful decision at a conference would be possible
only if the Congress participated in it. Therefore, within
a week after the conference, negotiations with the Congress
started once again.

The British authorities had made all that was necessary
to see to it that the new political set up that might emerge
out of the negotiations was favourable to them. The organizational
structure and the discussions in the Conference as
well as the statement of the British Prime Minister at the
end of the conference were orientated that way.

We have seen that there were three groups of participants
in the _First Round Table Conference_. Of these, the representatives
of the political parties of England and those representing
the Indian _Princely States_ were overtly opposed to the
goal of _full independence_ put forward by the Congress. They
were bent on putting every obstruction on the path of realizing
this goal. Among the British India delegates, there were,
besides the liberals like Sapru, Jayakar and Srinivasa Sastri,
representatives of minority communities like the Muslims,
the Depressed Castes, etc. Obviously the liberals had no sympathy
with the goal of _full independence_. The representatives
of the minority communities were more interested in furthering
their own communal interests than anything else.

And this provided a helpful atmosphere for the British
to put into practice their tactics of 'divide and rule'. The
British representatives argued for provisions to safeguard
the interests of the British capitalists who had invested in
India and of British officers serving in different parts of
India in various capacities. Besides, they tried to have the
vital departments of defence and foreign affairs to be vested
in the Viceroy instead of being handed over to the Indian
representatives.

The representatives of the _Princely States_ asked for
safeguards which would perpetuate their feudal rule. It was
amidst all these that the representatives of Muslims and the
Depressed Castes fought to bolster their 'special interests'.

The authorities used this situation to widen the gulf
that existed among these different interest groups, sharpen
the contradiction between them and make it appear that it
was because of these differences and contradictions that an
agreed solution failed to emerge. The authorities thought
that if this tactic succeeded, there would a big hurdle for
the Congress to cross, when the _Round Table Conference_ resumed
later with the participation of the Congress.

The _First Round Table Conference_ which was inaugurated
in this background took certain decisions unanimously,
One of the important decisions thus taken was that India's
future constitution should be federal in character and that
the British Indian provinces and the _Princely States_ should
have equal representation in it.

Apparently, it was a good decision. It meant that the
rulers of 600 and odd _Princely States_ which claimed themselves
to be fully independent and sovereign gave up that position
and agreed to become part of an administrative system
through elected representatives of the people. However, they
gave no assurance that the states which would become members
of federal India, would themselves institute democratic
governments based on the legislatures with elected representatives.
The idea was that this would in effect create obstacles
of autocratic rule in the states before the people of India
marching along the path of democracy.

This together with the vested interests of the British and
the claims of minority communities made it extremely difficult
for the realization of a system of _bourgeois_ democratic set
up as demanded even by the liberals. However, the 'moderates'
hoped that the decision with regard to a federal constitution
unanimously taken in the Conference would help to advance
along the path they desired. So, they wholeheartedly welcomed
the proposal.

But, once the discussions on the problems of minority
communities began, complications began to arise one after
another. Separate electorate envisaged for Muslims was
now demanded by the Depressed Castes leaders and certain
other minority communities as well. But the representatives
of the Muslim community stood firmly by their "special
rights" and emphatically stated in one voice that a constitution
which did not recognize this special right would not be acceptable
to them.

With this, the conference came to a standstill, and it
became impossible to proceed further. At this stage the final
plenary session of the delegates who were till then divided
into different sub-committees was held on 19th January 1931.
In that conference the Prime Minister made a statement on
behalf of the British government, which included the following
points.

1. The view of the British Government is that the responsibility
   for the Government of India should be placed upon
   the legislatures, central and provincial, with such provision
   as may be necessary to guarantee, during the period of
   transition, the observance of certain obligations and to meet
   other special circumstances, and also with such guarantees
   as are required by minorities to protect their political liberties
   and rights.
2. The British Government has taken note of the fact that
   the deliberations of the Conference have proceeded on the
   basis accepted by all parties, that the central Government
   should be a federation of all-India, embracing both the
   Indian states and British India in a bicameral legislature.
3. With the legislatures constituted on a federal basis, the
   British Government will be prepared to recognise the principle
   of the responsibility of the Executive to the Legislature.
4. Under the existing conditions the subjects of Defence
   and External Affairs will be reserved to the Governor General,
   and arrangements will be made to place in his hands
   the power necessary for the administration of these subjects.
   Moreover, as the Governor General must, as a last resort,
   be able in an emergency to maintain the tranquility of
   the State and must similarly be responsible for the observance
   of the constitutional rights of minorities, he must be
   granted the necessary powers for these purposes.
5. The Governor's Provinces will be constituted on the
   basis of full responsibility. Their Ministers will be taken
   from the Legislature and will be jointly responsible to it.
   The range of Provincial subjects will be so defined as to
   give them the greatest possible measure of _self-government_.
   The authority of the Federal Government will be limited to
   provisions required to secure its administration of Federal
   subjects and so discharge its responsibility for subjects
   defined in the constitution of all-India concern.

It also assured that while making safeguards during the
transition period as stated above, the reserved powers of
the Governor General and the Governors would be framed
and exercised "as not to prejudice the advance of India
through the new constitution to full responsibility for her
own Government".

Along with this, the Prime Minister made an observation
regarding the problem of minority communities. He stated
that the problem should be solved amicably through negotiations
among the different communities. He promised
the co-operation of his government in this regard.

He concluded his statement with an appeal to all
those concerned (the _Congressmen_) to call off the _civil
disobedience_ and participate in the future proceedings of the
Conference.

On 21 January, the _Congress Working Committee_ gave
a reply to this. It was stated emphatically that the proceedings
claimed to have taken place at the _Round Table Conference_
were not acceptable to the Congress. The Committee
charged the government with inviting only those whom it
liked and not those who really represented the Indian people.
The Committee pointedly stated that the Conference was
called by a government which had put behind the bars all the
leaders of the people striving to give shape to their aspirations,
a government which had resorted to ordinances one after
another, a government which had subjected thousands of
unarmed and peace-loving people to police _lathi-charge_ and
firings.

The Committee also made certain observations on the
statement made by the Prime Minister on 19th January. It
specifically stated that the Prime Minister's statement was
extremely vague and general and that it contained no concrete
proposal to justify a change in the policy of the Congress.
It made unambiguously clear that in the circumstances, the
only course open before the Congress and the people was to
further strengthen the struggle. As an indication of the continuance
of the struggle, the Committee appealed to the
people to observe the 26th January 1931 as _Independence Day_,
as a mighty demonstration of their firm determination to
march forward undeterred by repression.

Though a resolution to this effect was adopted, the
Committee decided against publishing it immediately. This
was because, as pointed out earlier, the leaders were determined
not to close the doors against any conciliatory move.
They were led by the suspicion that there was something in
between the lines in the Prime Minister's statement and the
desire to utilize it to go along the path of negotiation.

In this, they soon received an encouraging telegraphic
communication from London sent jointly by Sapru and
Srinivasa Sastri who had participated in the _Round Table
Conference_. They had sent this message when they were
returning to India after the Conference. It was an appeal
to the Congress leaders not to take any hasty decision regarding
the Prime Minister's statement and also a request for a
discussion of the matter with them soon after their arrival
in India. In deference to this, the Congress leaders decided
to postpone the publication of the resolution.

Events moved swiftly thereafter. On 25th January, the
Viceroy issued a statement. The essence of this statement
was that his government had decided, with the approval of
the provincial governments, to release from jail all members
of the _Working Committee_, both original and co-opted, who
were functioning from January 1930, in order to facilitate a
discussion on matters contained in the Prime Minister's
statement. The statement made it clear that the release
would be unconditional. It also made it clear that this decision
was an attempt to implement the Prime Minister's
statement and that his government would be behind none in
finding an amicable solution to the political and constitutional
problems once the situation returned to normalcy. The
Viceroy hoped that the Congress leaders would favourably
respond to the decision taken by the government.

Following this, 26 members of the _Working Committee_,
including those who had assumed charge temporarily, were
released. In a statement issued on his release, Gandhi said:

>I have come out of jail with an absolutely open mind, unfettered
by enmity, unbiased in argument and prepared to
study the situation, from every point of view and discuss the
Premier's statement with Tej Bahadur Sapru and other delegates.
on their return. I make this statement in deference to
the urgent wish expressed in a cable sent to me from London
by some of the delegates.

With this, the conditions changed as a whole. It may
be recalled that the talks which had taken place a few months
earlier in Naini Tal and Yerwada jails between Congress
leaders, on the one hand, and Sapru and Jayakar, on the
other, turned out to be unsuccessful. Gandhi had then
expressed the view that conditions prevailing at that time
were not conducive to negotiations. Now, the conditions
were becoming conducive. It was impossible then to call off
the struggle or come to an agreement with the government
on the basis of a decision by Congress leaders individually or
by a few of them. Now, all the top leaders of the Congress
were free. Thus, it became possible for them to hold discussions
and chalk out future programmes taking into
consideration the background of the _Round Table Conference_
held in their absence and the decisions emerging from
it. Thus, a new chapter was being opened in the history
of the _Satyagraha_ struggle of 1930.

## THE _GANDHI-IRWIN PACT_

As the top Congress leaders came out of the jail on the
unilateral decision taken by the authorities, the Congress
had to face a thoroughly confusing new situation. An impression
had gained ground among the people that an agreement
between the Congress and the government was in the
offing and that the struggle would be withdrawn. This was
strengthened by the decision of the _Working Committee_ not
to publish its resolution to continue the struggle.

However, the repression let loose against Congress
workers with the launching of the _Salt Satyagraha_ did not
end with the release of the leaders. Police _lathi-charge_ and
other repressive actions continued as before. Moreover,
there was a widespread feeling among Congress ranks and
the people in general against holding talks with the authorities
and reaching a compromise with them. Besides, the
Congress leadership which had to conduct talks with the
authorities against popular feelings, had to face innumerable
knotty problems in the course of the talks.

However, Gandhi and other top Congress leaders had
no doubt that a "situation mature enough for negotiations"
had come. So they held talks with Sastri, Sapru and Jayakar
soon after their arrival from London. And they came to
the conclusion that Gandhi and the Viceroy should begin
talks. At the same time, they decided to continue the
struggle while proceeding with talks. The _Working Committee_
which met at Allahabad on 31st January adopted the following
resolution:

>The _Working Committee_ having, out of regard for the
>wishes of Syts Sastri, Sapru and Jayakar, suspended
>publication of its resolution passed an 21--1-31, an impression
>has got abroad that the movement of _Civil Disobedience_
>has been suspended. It is, therefore, necessary to reiterate
>the decision of the Committee that the movement is to
>continue unabated until explicit instructions are issued
>to the contrary. This meeting reminds the public that
>picketing of foreign cloth and drink and drug shops in itself
>is no part of the _Civil Disobedience_ campaign, but that it is
>the exercise of the ordinary right of a citizen, so long as
>it remains strictly peaceful and causes no obstruction to the
>public.
>
>This meeting further reminds the sellers of foreign cloth,
>including foreign yarn, and Congress workers that the _boycott_
>of foreign cloth being a vital necessity in the interest of
>the masses, is a permanent feature of national activity and
>will remain so till the nation bas acquired the power to
>exclude foreign cloth and foreign yarn form India, whether
>by total prohibition or by prohibitive tariff.
>
>Whilst the response made by dealers in foreign cloth
>and foreign yarn to the appeal of the Congress to bring about
>a _boycott_ of foreign cloth, this meeting reminds them that it
>is not open to any Congress organization to hold out hopes of
>their being able to dispose of their existing stock in India.[^14/2]

[^14/2]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _The History of Indian National Congress_, Bombay
Padma publication (1964 reprint), p. 430

It can be seen that though the resolution gave a general
directive on the continuance of the struggle, it contained,
nothing concrete about anything, except on the _boycott_ of
foreign cloth and yarn. It was a time when various struggles,
including a "no-tax campaign", were going on in many
provinces including UP, the home province of the Nehrus.
The local Congress workers had to face numerous problems
in relation to each of these struggles. The Committee which
did not bother to give clear directions on these issues, however,
made it clear that even if the _civil disobedience
movement_ was withdrawn, the _boycott_ of foreign cloth would
continue. That the _civil disobedience movement_ might be
put off subject to certain conditions was thus implied in the
resolution which stated that the struggle must continue until
specific instructions were received.

This later led to differences and contradictions between
the leadership and ranks in the Congress, which we shall see
in the following sections. Within the Congress leadership
itself, there were some who looked upon the path of negotiations
with subdued opposition out of personal reverence to
Gandhi. Knowing all this, the leadership decided to take
itself to the path of negotiations.

When these developments were taking place, Motilal was
on his death-bed. He invited his colleagues in the _Working
Committee_ to Allahabad and expressed his wish to have the
discussions, which were to decide the future of India, held
in his presence at _Swaraj Bhawan_. He also made it clear
that the path he had chosen was one of negotiations. At the
same time, his only son, Jawaharlal, was badly disturbed at
the path of negotiations. This difference in approach between
the father and the son was symbolic of the difference
of opinion that was growing among Congress workers all
over the country.

Motilal Nehru passed away on 6th February before Sapru,
Jayakar and other delegates returned from England. The
impact of Motilal's death on Gandhi was revealed in several
of his statements. But what disturbed him more was the
continuance of the policy of repression by the government
even after his and his colleague's release from jail. Gandhi
said:

>Despite the official peace offer from Great Britain,
unprovoked assaults on innocent persons still continue.
Respectable persons are summarily and without apparent
reason deprived of their immovable and movable property
by mere executive action. A procession of women was forcibly
disbursed. They were seized by the hair and kicked
with boots. The continuance of such repression will make
Congress cooperation impossible even if other difficulties are
got over.

While all these were going on publicly, the Congress
leadership had given certain secret instructions as well.
According to Pattabhi Sitaramayya, the leadership instructed
the "_Congressmen_ not to start new struggles" and "not to
create new situations, although they might vigorously continue
the ongoing struggles". In other words, while voicing public
protest against the repressive policy of the government, the
leadership was in fact containing the fighting spirit of the
_Congressmen_.

It was necessary for the leadership to show that the
masses were behind it when it entered into negotiation with
the government, and at the same time it did not want to see
anything standing in the way of serious negotiations that
might be started when the "situation became mature". The
tactic they adopted was such that it served both these purposes.

Soon after their return from England, Sastri and Sapru
went to Allahabad and held prolonged discussions with Gandhi
and other Congress leaders. They suggested that, since
the government had taken the initiative for bilateral negotiations
in the form of releasing the top Congress leaders,
Gandhi must, without hesitation, write to the Viceroy seeking
appointment with him for direct talks. Accordingly, the first
round of talks between Gandhi and the Viceroy was held on 17th February which continued for two more days. All the
members of the _Working Committee_ were summoned to Delhi,
to become available for consultations during the talks. The
talks and consultations went on for quite some days at different
levels --- between the Viceroy and Gandhi, between Gandhi
and the members of the _Working Committee_, between the
Viceroy and the authorities in London and so on. Enquiry
into repression, the structure and powers of the _Round Table
Conference_, the release of political prisoners and a number
of other subjects came up for discussion. The question of
withdrawal or suspension of the struggle launched by the
Congress also came up. On each issue, contradictory proposals
came up from each side and compromise proposals were
worked out on a "_give and take_" basis.

At every stage the hope that the 'talks were progressing
successfully' and the despair that they were 'foundering'
alternated. In the end, by 5th March certain proposals acceptable
to both Gandhi and the Viceroy were worked out.
These proposals which Gandhi had accepted in his individual
capacity were immediately placed before the _Working
Committee_.

Nehru has gone on record in his _Autobiography_ that one
of the important proposals that Gandhi brought, _viz._, the
proposal on the framework of the future constitution, shocked
him. According to that proposal, what remained to be
done was only a more detailed discussion of the scheme of
_administrative reforms_ which was already discussed at the
_first Round Table Conference_. One of the essential elements
of the scheme was Federation; the other elements were '_responsible
government_' for India and the introduction of the
necessary safeguards in matters of defence and foreign
relations in keeping with interests of India. Similar safeguards
were to be introduced in other matters like the status
of minorities, the economic status of India and the liability
of public debt.

Nehru felt that the inclusion of these terms in the
negotiations which Gandhi conducted, though as an individual,
on behalf of the Congress endangered the objective of _full
independence_. He wondered if it was for an administrative
system with such 'safeguards' that they laboured so hard.
Was it for this that the resolution of _full independence_ and
the pledge were repeated several times? Feeling utterly
depressed, Nehru wrote in his _Autobiography_: "so I lay and
pondered on that March night, and in my heart there was a
great emptiness as of something precious gone, almost beyond
recall."

To satisfy Nehru and those of his thinking, Gandhi
gave certain interpretations to these terms. The explanation
was that it had been clearly stated that the safeguards visualized
in the compromise proposals worked out by him and
the Viceroy would be in the interests of India. Though this
did not convince him, Nehru stated, the talks he had with
Gandhi soothed his feelings to some extent. Accordingly,
despite the mental conflict and physical strain it caused, he
decided to accept the compromise proposal as interpreted
by Gandhi and make others accept it also.

Although Nehru and some other leaders accepted it out
of personal regard for Gandhi and their unshaken confidence
in him, discontent spread fast among the Congress ranks particularly
among the younger generation. Presiding over the
conference of the _All-India Naujawan Bharat Sabha_ held a
few days after the conclusion of the _Gandhi-Irwin pact_, Subhas
Bose gave vent to this discontent. A resolution incorporating
the feelings he had expressed was passed by the conference.
Also, at the Karachi session of the Congress held during the
same period, similar feelings were expressed against the
_Gandhi-Irwin Pact_.

One of the reasons for the expression of such feelings
was the continuance of the repression by the government
and the fact that no political prisoners other than the
_Satyagrahis_ were released from jail. Bhagat Singh and his
comrades were awaiting the hangman's noose. The government
was not willing to commute their death sentence. Tens
of thousands of people sentenced for "violent activities"
(many of them were _Congressmen_ themselves) were languishing
in jails. What made the ordinary political workers angry
was the fact that Gandhi had agreed to discontinue the
struggle at a time when the government was resorting to
revengeful actions against the activists who had devoted
their lives to the service of the country.

Gandhi did try to give expression to this feeling of the
people. He did not hesitate to plead with the Viceroy in the
most humble manner to save the life of Bhagat Singh and his
comrades and the release of all the political prisoners. But
his efforts proved to be of no avail. The Viceroy only stayed
the execution of Bhagat Singh and others for a few days and
promised to re-examine the cases of other political prisoners
in a lenient way.

The issue of those who had lost their jobs in the course
of the struggle, of political workers and other citizens who
had lost their properties, etc., were also brought to the
attention of the Viceroy in all their seriousness. But the
government was not willing to give any serious consideration
to these issues.

At the same time, on the issue of constitution, the
Congress retreated not only from its declared objective of
_full independence_ but also from _Dominion Status_. This was
what made the ordinary _Congressmen_ and a considerable
section of the people uneasy and dissatisfied. However, as
far as the Congress leadership, including Gandhi, was concerned,
the main consideration was to make maximum
gain out of the struggle which had been going on for nearly
a year. They had succeeded in making the government
recognize the fact that no talks on reforms would be fruitful
without the participation of the Congress. The Congress
leaders and the majority of Congress workers had been
released; and it was possible now to strengthen the organization
through the tireless activities of these workers.

In this circumstance, the leadership of the Congress
gave formally its approval 'unanimously' to the compromise
(despite the opposition privately expressed by Jawaharlal
Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and some others) in the hope that
with the newly acquired political stature and influence, it
would be possible to meet the manoeuvres of the authorities
and reach its goal step by step.
