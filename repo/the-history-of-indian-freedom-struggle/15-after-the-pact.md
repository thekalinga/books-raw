# AFTER THE PACT

## SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS OF THE PACT

The _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_ was signed on 5th March 1931. It
evoked both favourable and unfavourable reactions in
the Congress leadership and among the people. Both these
reactions found expression in the Karachi session of the
Congress held towards the end of the month.

However, there were certain things in the Pact which
caused joy and enthusiasm among ordinary Congress workers
as well as the masses. The volunteers who participated
in the prolonged _civil disobedience movement_ as well as
people at large felt proud and self-confident of the fact that
the rulers who realized that the propaganda slander let loose
by them against the movement and the brutal repression let
loose failed to stem the popular upsurge, were finally compelled
to negotiate with the national leadership.

The fact that Gandhi who had been ridiculed as the
"half-naked _fakir_" was invited to the Viceroy's lodge where
he held talks with the representative of the British Crown
as equals leading to the signing of a pact between the two
brought immense prestige to the national leadership in the
eyes of millions in India and abroad. This helped to make
Indian people confident of their organized strength and to
reinforce their determination to utilize it to march forward
to _full independence_.

The terms of agreement were also helpful to create such
an impression. On the very issue on which Gandhi had
launched his _Dandi March_ a year earlier, the authorities
had climbed down to some extent, and the people got the
right to make salt subject to certain conditions. The people
also got the right subject to certain restrictions to picket
foreign cloth shops and liquor shops. The Congress committees
which were declared illegal following the _civil disobedience
movement_ regained their freedom to function.

Above all, tens of thousands of _Satyagrahis_ who were
jailed following the _civil disobedience_ were released. The
thousands of meetings which were organized to accord reception
to them became full-scale propaganda meetings combined
with demonstration. The men and women who underwent
imprisonment for participating in the _Satyagraha_ won the
recognition and respect of the society. As a reflection of this,
the Congress leadership issued the directive to the effect that 50 percent of the delegates attending the Karachi Congress
should be the _Satyagrahis_ released from jails or those elected
by the _Satyagrahis_.

There was, however, another side of the coin. A
considerable section of the _Satyagrahis_ and lakhs of people
felt that though the authorities were compelled to climb down
to a considerable extent from the position they had taken
before the _civil disobedience movement_, the Congress leadership
surrendered on many vital issues. The local authorities
were continuing their repressive actions, particularly
against the peasant movement of UP which was started as
part of the _civil disobedience movement_, the "_Red Shirt_"
movement of NWFP, etc. Besides, when people began to
exercise their rights granted as per the terms of the Pact,
such as making salt and picketing foreign cloth and liquor
shops, the local authorities put numerous obstructions before
them. Because of all this, even ordinary _Congressmen_ who
were not known as leftists got concerned about the desirability
of the "Pact" and the future mode of action.

To crown all these, there was the problem of the release
of political prisoners. According to the terms of the Pact, only
the _Satyagrahis_ were to be released. Hence, those who were
put behind the bars for "bomb politics" or Communism or
even trade union activities did not come within the purview
of the agreement. Even among the _Satyagrahis_, those convicted
for "violent activities" would have to continue in Jail.
Among them were a large number of ordinary _Congressmen_.
Besides, there were a number of revolutionaries who were
confined to jail without trial right from the beginning of the
First World War.

In this context, the death sentence on Bhagat Singh,
Rajaguru and Sukhdev deserves particular mention. The
demand had come from all over the country that they should
be saved from the gallows. The very millions who adored
Gandhi as the leader of the _civil disobedience movement_ also
adored Bhagat Singh as another noble symbol of the national
struggle. Hence, it made the people generally uneasy when
Gandhi had made a pact with a Viceroy who refused to commute
the death sentence on Bhagat Sing and his comrades.
A section among them and the leftist political workers publicly
criticized Gandhi for such a compromise, And as a protest
against this, when Gandhi and the president-elect Vallabhbhai
Patel arrived at Karachi for the Congress session, a section
of the people came out to receive them with black garlands
and flowers.

Even at the time of signing the Pact, Gandhi was aware
of the feelings of the people. In a statement to the press
issued immediately after signing it, Gandhi said:

>I owe a word to hundreds, if not thousands of my erstwhile
>fellow prisoners on whose behalf I have been receiving
>wires, and who will still be languishing in jails when _Satyagrahi_
>prisoners who were jailed during the past 12 months
>will have been discharged. Personally I do not believe
>imprisoning, by way of punishment, even those who commit
>violence, through political motives, are entitled to
>claim, if not the same wisdom, certainly the same spirit of
>love and self-sacrifice that I would claim for myself.
>And, therefore, I could have justly secured their liberty
>in preference to my own, or that of fellow _Satyagrahis_, I
>should truthfully have secured it.
>
>But I trust they will realize that I could not in justice ask
>for their discharge. But that does not mean that I or the
>members of the _Working Committee_ have not them in mind.
>The Congress has embarked deliberately, though provisionally,
>on a career of _co-operation_. If _Congressmen_ honourably
>and fully implement the conditions applicable to them
>of the settlement, the Congress will obtain an irresistible
>prestige and would have inspired the Government with confidence
>in its ability to ensure peace as, I think, it has
>proved its ability to conduct disobedience.
>
>And if the people in general will clothe the Congress with
>that power and prestige, I promise that it will not be long
>before every one of these political prisoners is discharged,
>including the detenus, the Meerut prisoners, and all the
>rest.[^15/1]

Vol. I, Bombay, Padma Publications (1946 reprint), p. 447.

In this statement Gandhi dealt not only with the question
of political prisoners but also with the parties and groups
which had adopted revolutionary means as distinct from his
path of _non-violence_. He appealed to them to give up the
path of violence, if not as a creed but at least from the practical
point of view. He appealed to them to examine what
a tremendous people's might was unleashed by the struggle
he organized on the basis of _non-violence_. He requested
them:

>Let them preserve their precious lives for the service
of the motherland to which all will be presently called, and
let then give to the Congress an opportunity of securing the
release of all the political prisoners and may be even securing
from the gallows those who are condemned to them as
being guilty of murder.

At the same time, he made it clear that he did not propose
to make the people victims to any baseless optimism.
He could only declare openly what he personally and the
Congress desired; results were always in the hands of God
 --- that was his position.

What prompted Gandhi to issue such a statement was
his realization of the stubbornness on the part of the
government, on the one side, and the intensity of the people's
feelings, on the other. The authorities were not wholly
willing even to release the _Satyagrahis_. In the circumstances,
one need not speculate on the position they would take on
the question of commutation of the death sentence on Bhagat
Singh and his comrades and the release of those sentenced
for "violent" activities.

On the contrary, for the people the touchstone of the
intentions of the authorities was their attitude towards the
death sentence on Bhagat Singh and his colleagues and the
release of other political prisoners. In fact, these two issues
played a crucial role in the Gandhi-Irwin talks. There were
two courses open before Gandhi: Either to end the talks on
the basis of disagreement on these issues and restart the struggle
or get at least the _Satyagrahis_ released and the restrictions
placed on the Congress withdrawn, thereby creating the hope
in the minds of the people that it would be possible to get the
political prisoners released along with the resolution of other
issues through organized activities of the Congress. It was
clear from Gandhi's statement that he had chosen the latter
course. Thus, the Karachi Congress was held while thousands
of political prisoners, who, according to Gandhi himself,
were "patriotic and self-sacrificing though working through
a wrong method", were languishing in prisons, and Bhagat
Singh and his comrades had already been executed. (Realizing
the difficulty the execution of Bhagat Singh and his
comrades might create for Gandhi and the Congress,
Irwin offered to stay the execution till after the Karachi
session. But Gandhi rejected the offer. Gandhi made it clear
that if the authorities were determined to hang these young
men, he would face its consequence and that he did not need
any concession in the matter. Thus, on 23rd March they were
hanged. The Karachi Congress began on the 29th.)

The Karachi Congress which met in this background
witnessed many a stormy situation. Among the delegates
there was a large section which basically challenged the
_Gandhi-Irwin Pact_. At least a small minority in the leadership
too was of the same opinion. We have already referred
to the speech that Subhas Bose made as the representative of
the Congress Youth and the leftists, and the resolution
passed at the session of the youth held under his chairmanship.
Jawaharlal himself was unhappy. He wrote in his
_Autobiography_ :

>The principal resolution at Karachi dealt with the _Delhi
Pact_ and the _Round Table Conference_. I accepted it, of
course, as it emerged from the _Working Committee_, but
when I was asked to move it in the open Congress,
I hesitated. I went against the grain, and I refused first,
and then this seemed a weak and unsatisfactory position
to take up. Either I was for it or against it, and it was not
proper to prevaricate or leave people guessing in the matter.
Almost at the last moment, a few minutes before the resolution
was taken up in the open Congress, I decided to
sponsor it. In my speech I tried to lay before the gathering
quite frankly what my feelings were and why I have
wholeheartedly accepted that resolution and pleaded with
them to accept it. That speech made on the spur of the
moment and coming from the heart, and with little ornament
or fine phrasing in it, was probably a great success
than many of my other efforts, which had followed a more
careful preparations.

This was also the position of a majority of the delegates.
They in fact, could not digest this compromise. They felt
there was something wrong with it. But, the question as to
what other course was open before them worried them. However,
the release of a large number of their colleagues and
the freedom of activity which came in the wake of the compromise
had put some confidence in them. Thus, like Nehru,
they too, with hesitation, finally accepted it.

But during the discussions on the resolution on the execution
of Bhagat Singh and his comrades, the emotion of the
delegates became evident. The resolution which began with,
"This Congress while dissociating itself from and disapproving
of political violence in any shape or form", placed on
record "its admiration of the bravery and sacrifice of Bhagat
Singh and his comrades, Sukhdev and Rajaguru". The
resolution further stated that by their execution, "the Government
have lost the golden opportunity of promoting
good will between the two nations, admittedly held to be
essential at this juncture, and of winning over to the method
of peace, the party which, being driven to despair, resorts
to political violence".

Many delegates demanded deletion of the introductory
part of the resolution. While a heated debate on this was
going on inside, a huge black-flag demonstration was going
on outside. It was a demonstration of the feelings of the
leftist who held that Gandhi and the Congress leadership
which was holding fast the Gandhian method of "_non-violence_",
were mainly responsible for not commuting the
death sentence of Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

The resolution ratifying the _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_ was
adopted formally without any serious opposition. But the
resolution against the execution of Bhagat Singh and his
comrades was adopted in the face of opposition of an organized
minority. Although this clearly indicated the gap that
existed between Gandhi and his followers, with the adoption
of the resolution with the approval of the large majority of
the delegates, the unity of the Congress and the leading role
of Gandhi in it were consolidated.

## RESOLUTION ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

The Karachi Congress adopted a few more resolutions
besides the one ratifying the _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_ and the one
protesting against the execution of Bhagat Singh and his
comrades. The most important of these was the one enunciating
the fundamental rights which were to be adopted as
the "directive principles of the future constitution".

The Policy of Gandhi and the Congress High Command
was one of making such declarations as would satisfy the
'leftists' and of bargaining with the authorities under that
cover to bring about such changes in the administrative set
up as would protect their own (_bourgeois_) class interests.
It was as part of this strategy that they came forward,
with much hesitation though, to adopt the resolution on _full
independence_ at Lahore. It was with the same intention
that Gandhi and Vallabhbhai Patel, who commanded much
larger support withdrew to make Jawaharlal Nehru, the
known leftist leader, the president of the Congress. The
resolution on fundamental rights adopted at Karachi was
only a continuation of this strategy.

As already indicated, there was bitter resentment among
the people against the _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_ and the execution
of Bhagat Singh and his comrades. This had spread among
the ranks of the Congress as well. In the words of
Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya:

>At Karachi, there was a certain
cleavage between the younger and the older sections. People
were not wanting who began to doubt whether, after all, the
Congress was not drifting with the old current of _Dominion
Status_, British Imperialism and a Brown Bureaucracy and
whether the labour problem --- of the peasants and the workers --- and
Socialistic ideals were not going by the board. It
was necessary to reassure the country on this subject. Gandhi
was game for any issue provided it was an issue based on
_Truth and Non-violence_, and it was an issue too of the village
and the poor man.[^15/2]

[^15/2]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya. _Ibid_, p. 462.

It was in these circumstances that Jawaharlal Nehru
raised the question of fundamental rights in which he was
specially interested and presented it in the form of a resolution
before the _Working Committee_. Sitaramayya states
that there were many who doubted if it was proper to adopt
a resolution in such a hurry. Consequently, the _AICC_ was
entrusted with the task of reviewing the resolution to be
presented at the Karachi session and introducing suitable
amendments to it.

It is thus clear that Gandhi and his colleagues came
forward to adopt the left-oriented resolution prepared by
Nehru as a means to appease a section of the _Congressmen_
and the people at large who felt dissatisfied at the compromise
which Gandhi made with the rulers who had ordered
the execution of Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

In a sense, the very introduction to the resolution on
fundamental rights revealed the real situation. It said:

>This Congress is of the opinion that to enable the masses
to appreciate what _swaraj_ as conceived by the Congress,
will mean to them, it is desirable to state the position of the
Congress in a manner easily understood by them. In order
to end the exploitation of the masses, political freedom must
include real economic freedom of the starving millions. The
Congress, therefore, declares that any constitution which
may be agreed to on its behalf, should provide or enable the
_swaraj_ government to provide for the following: ...

As an inseparable part of the resolution ratifying the
_Gandhi-Irwin Pact_, it was decided that the Congress should
participate in the _Second Round Table Conference_ subject
to certain conditions. It was doubted, quite justifiably, if
a conference called by the British with the participation of
such disparate groups as the native princes, organizations of
communal and caste politics and the liberal political leaders
would lead to the declared objective of _full independence_.
(It was, in fact, this doubt which created discontent among
the people and the Congress ranks.) In order to resolve this
problem, the resolution while ratifying the Pact, made it
clear that the Congress delegates to the _Round Table Conference_
would be working for a system in which India
would have the right to sever relations with Britain at any
time and the people's representatives would have the real
right to exercise power over all departments, including
defence. But, even with this, the discontent among Congress
ranks, particularly the youth, could not be met. The
resolution on fundamental rights was yet another attempt
designed to serve the purpose.

It is worth noticing in this connection what Nehru states
in his _Autobiography_:

>(The resolution on Fundamental Rights) interested me
especially, partly because of what it contained, and even
more so because it represented a new outlook in the Congress.
So far the Congress has thought along purely
nationalist lines, and had avoided facing economic issues,
except in so far as it encouraged cottage industries and
_Swadeshi_ generally. In the Karachi resolution, it took a
step in a Socialist direction by advocating nationalisation
of key industries and services, and various other measures
to lessen the burden on the poor and increase it on the
rich. This was not Socialism at all, and a capitalist state
could easily accept almost everything contained in that
resolution.

Though Nehru declared that there was surely no Socialism
in it, the contents of the resolution on fundamental
rights which he got adopted on his own initiative made a
tremendous impact all over the country. Hundreds of
thousands of _Congressmen_ and the masses of people who had
no particular links with Socialism or Communism till then
were happy at and inspired by this resolution unanimously
passed under Nehru's initiative with Gandhi's blessings, by
the Congress.

However, the official circles, the _feudal-bourgeois_
interests and the bureaucracy got panicky over it. It was
widely propagated following the footsteps of imperialism
and its agents, that behind the Karachi Congress were hidden
"Bolshevik conspiracy" and "Russian gold". Nehru himself
has mentioned in his _autobiography_ about the rumour
spread by these circles that "an unknown person with
Communist leanings" met him at Karachi and the resolution
he moved was drafted by that man. Nehru emphatically
stated that all these were false, and he only placed before the
Congress certain proposals which he considered right. None
who has studied his nature and read his _autobiography_ could
ever question this statement. Though Nehru used to maintain
contacts with Communists and Socialists and tried to understand
their ideas, at no time did he show any indication of
being amenable to the suggestions of any group other than
the Congress. Other than picking an idea helpful to his
"left" _bourgeois_ outlook and pleading for that inside the
Congress, at no time did he adopt working class politics
against left _bourgeois_ politics. This was, in fact, the "principal
merit" that Gandhi and other Congress leaders had
found in him.

However, one could still discern certain Communist and
Socialist ideas reflected in the Karachi resolution on fundamental
rights. Though the Communists had ceased to be an
organized force following the _Meerut Conspiracy Case_, many
of them were still working within the Congress and outside,
in co-operation with individual _Congressmen_. There were
also other political groups which, though not Communists,
were working for the class interests of workers and peasants.
They were all with the _Congressmen_ in jails for participating
in the _civil disobedience movement_. Also, with _Congressmen_
in jails were the revolutionary groups which were more
numerous than the Communist and Socialist groups.

Traces of intimacy and friendship with them were
evident inside the Congress and among the delegates to the
Karachi session. Besides, MN Roy who played an important
role in the growth of the _Indian Communist_ movement
in its early days had arrived in India and started working in contact with different political groups, after being expelled
from the _Communist International_. It was rumoured in the
official circles that the "unknown person" mentioned in
Nehru's _autobiography_ was MN Roy.

Though under the influence of different revolutionary
groups, the resolution on fundamental rights which Nehru
got passed at the Karachi Congress was a programme which,
in his own words, "a capitalist state could easily accept".
The Karachi resolution on the fundamental rights did not
contain anything beyond the _bourgeois_ democratic slogans
raised by those who led _bourgeois revolutions_ in France and
other European countries. To enable the readers to appreciate
this, the _Declaration of Fundamental Rights_ contained
in the resolution, as varied by the _AICC_ meeting held
in Bombay in August 1931, is reproduced below. Under
the head "Fundamental Rights and Duties" 14 items are
listed, as follows:

1. Every citizen in India has the right of free expression
   of opinion, the right of free association and combination,
   and the right to assemble peacefully and
   without arms, for purposes not opposed to law and
   morality.
2. Every citizen shall enjoy freedom of conscience and
   the right freely to profess and practise his religion,
   subject to public order and morality.
3. The culture, the language and script of the minorities
   and of the different linguistic areas shall be protected.
4. All citizens are equal before the law, irrespective of
   religion, caste, creed or sex.
5. No disability attaches to any citizen, by reason of his
   or her religion, caste, creed or sex, in regard to public
   employment, office of power or honour, and in the
   exercise of any trade or calling.
6. All citizens have equal rights and duties in regard to
   wells, tanks, roads, schools and places of public resort,
   maintained out of State or local funds, or dedicated
   by private persons for the use of the general
   public.
7. Every citizen has the right to keep and bear arms, in
   accordance with regulations and reservations made
   in that behalf.
8. No person shall be deprived of his liberty nor shall his
   dwelling or property be entered, sequestered, or
   confiscated, save in accordance with law.
9. The State shall observe neutrality in regard to all
   religions.
10. The franchise shall be on the basis of universal adult
    suffrage.
11. The state shall provide for free and compulsory
    primary education.
12. The state shall confer no titles.
13. There shall be no capital punishment.
14. Every citizen is free to move throughout India and
    to stay and settle in any part thereof, to acquire
    property and to follow any trade or calling, and to
    be treated equally with regard to legal prosecution
    of protection in all parts of India.

A close examination of these 14 items reveals that not
one of them goes beyond the scope of _bourgeois democracy_.
In fact, they constituted the basis for the Fundamental Rights
enshrined in the constitution of "free" India adopted in 1950.
Suffice it to say that the Constitution was framed by limiting
the scope of many of the items included in the Karachi resolution
and by incorporating certain rights which it had
originally denied to the vested interests (e.g., the right of
religious bodies to conduct their own educational institutions).
Obviously, there was not an iota of Socialism in it.

Another paragraph in the resolution is concerned with
labour. It includes the following items.

1. The organisation of economic life must conform to
   the principle of justice, to the end that it may secure
   a decent standard of living.
2. The state shall safeguard the interests of industrial
   workers and shall secure for them, by suitable legislation
   and in other ways, a living wage, healthy
   conditions of work, limited hours of labour, suitable
   machinery for the settlement of disputes between
   employers and workmen, and protection against the
   economic consequences of old age, sickness, and
   unemployment.
3. Labour to be freed from serfdom and conditions bordering
   on serfdom.
4. Protection of women workers, and especially, adequate
   provision for leave during maternity period.
5. Children of school going age shall not be employed
   in mines and factories.
6. Peasants and workers shall have the right to form
   unions to protect their interests.

It needs no particular mention that this does not provide
any rights to workers and employees beyond those granted in
capitalist countries, including England, where social democratic
parties were in power. But the Congress till then was not
willing to adopt even these provisions officially. It may be
stated that these were the provisions which did not find a
place in the programme formulated by Gandhi when the
_Khilafat_-_Non-cooperation_ movements were launched or before
launching the Salt Sathyagraha, but demanded by the _AITUC_
and the Socialist-Communist groups from their very inception.
It is, therefore, important that they were now included in
the official resolution adopted by the Congress.

Equally important were the following items listed in the
paragraph on "Taxes and Expenditure".

1. The system of land tenure and revenue and rent shall,
   be reformed and on equitable adjustment made of
   the burden on agricultural land, immediately giving
   relief to the smaller peasantry, by a substantial reduction
   of agricultural rent and revenue now paid by
   them, and in case of uneconomic holdings, exempting
   them from rent so long as necessary, with such relief
   as may be just and necessary to holders of small estates
   affected by such exemption or reduction in rent, and
   to the same end, imposing a graded tax on net income
   from land above a reasonable minimum.
2. Death duties on a graduated scale shall be levied on
   property above a fixed minimum.
3. There shall be a drastic reduction of military expenditure
   so as to bring it down to at least one half of
   the present scale.
4. Expenditure and salaries in civil departments shall
   be largely reduced. No servant of the state, other
   than specially employed experts and the like, shall be
   paid above a certain fixed figure, which should not
   ordinarily exceed Rs. 500 per month.
5. No duty shall be levied on salt manufactured in
   India.

The influence of the organized peasant movement can
be seen in the first item. Even here, apart from the reduction
in the rates of tax and rent, the question of elimination of
big landlords was not raised. Thus, in the matter of land
relations, the Congress, at that stage, did not adopt even
the path of _bourgeois transformation_, let alone that of _bourgeois
revolution_.

The last paragraph of the Karachi Resolution dealt
with the "Economic and Social Programme". It contained:

1. The state shall protect indigenous cloth; and for this
   purpose the policy of exclusion of foreign cloth and
   foreign yarn from the country and adopt such other
   measures as may be found necessary. The state shall
   also protect other indigenous industries, when necessary,
   against foreign competition.
2. Intoxicating drinks and drugs shall be totally prohibited,
   except for medicinal purposes.
3. Currency and exchange shall be regulated in the
   national interest.
4. The state shall own or control key industries and
   services, mineral resources, railways, waterways,
   shipping and other means of public transport.
5. Relief of agricultural indebtedness and control of
   usury --- direct and indirect.
6. The state shall provide for the military training to
   citizens so as to organise a means of national defence
   apart from the regular military forces.

It is clear that even this paragraph did not contain anything
beyond the scope of a _bourgeois_ government. Later
events demonstrated the realization on the part of the _bourgeoisie_
that those sectors of industries which are of vital
importance even for capitalist development should be under
the ownership and control of the government. Only this
idea was included in the Karachi resolution.

But, as pointed out by Nehru in his _Autobiography_ and
by Dr. Sitaramayya in his History of the _Indian National Congress_
this resolution helped to meet, to an extent, the discontent of
the leftists. While continuing the policy of bargaining with
the rulers either through Gandhi and others leaders participating
in the _Round Table Conference_ or otherwise, they were
thus able to tie down the leftists to their own organized political
leadership by creating confidence in them that they
could approach the people with the resolution on fundamental
rights.

## ATMOSPHERE OF TENSION AND COMPROMISE AGAIN

As we have noted, the _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_ was signed
on the understanding that the Congress would participate
in the (second) _Round Table Conference_. Consequently,
when the Karachi Congress adopted the resolution ratifying
the Pact, it was decided that Gandhi and those nominated
by the _Working Committee_ would participate in the Conference.

In the first _Working Committee_ meeting following the
Congress, the question came up as to how many should participate
in the Conference. It was proposed first that because
many difficult problems were to be handled, a team of 15 to 20 representatives should be sent. In the discussion it was,
however, made clear that the task of the Conference was
not to frame the future constitution of independent India,
but to negotiate with the British rulers on the future administrative
set up of India. As such, it was finally decided to
send Gandhi as the sole representative of the Congress. Besides,
Gandhi had got an assurance from Viceroy Irwin that
besides the official representative of the Congress, Pandit
Malaviya, Sarojini Naidu and Dr. Ansari would be nominated
by the Government.

But, by the time the delegates had reached home after
the Karachi Congress, the situation had begun to deteriorate.
ate. There were constant frictions between the Congress
workers and the local authorities. Before going into details,
a central fact needs to be stated here. The understanding
arrived at between Gandhi and Lord Irwin, and between the
bureaucrats under Irwin and Gandhi was absent in the case
of Congress workers and the government officials at the local
level. As a result of the struggle that had gone on for
a year, the Congress workers had gained the confidence that
theirs was an organization with its own political individuality, and they were determined to utilize it to further consolidate
their rapport with the people. They engaged themselves in
arranging heroic welcomes to the leaders and volunteers
coming out of the jail, revitalizing the Congress committees
which were banned in the wake of the _civil disobedience
movement_, and organizing Congress committees wherever
the organization did not exist before the struggle. The leaders
and workers at all levels were also engaged in propaganda
campaigns explaining to the people the issues involved
in the _civil disobedience movement_, the stands taken by the
Government and the Congress on each of these issues and
the terms of agreement reached between Gandhi and Irwin
on them.

As part of this, campaign meetings and demonstrations
were held constantly in different parts of the country. The
Congress flag flew aloft all over the country. In accordance
with the terms of the agreement, the popularization of
_swadeshi_, the picketing of foreign cloth and liquor shops,
volunteer training, etc., had also begun. Thus, _Congressmen_
demonstrated through their action that they were the leaders
of a movement which was surging ahead challenging all the
repressions unleashed by the government.

These things disturbed the local authorities. They accused
the _Congressmen_ of running the organization as a parallel
government. Violating the terms of the Pact, they resorted
to _lathi-charge_ against Congress demonstrations in a
number of places. In many places, officers refused to release
those who were still in jail or to return the fines realized
from the people. They also refused to reinstate the dismissed
government employees; nor did they care to pay off the
due benefits to those who had resigned their jobs. Restrictions
were imposed on the number of volunteers and the
places chosen for picketing.

In short, conscious attempts were made by the local
authorities to take back some and to restrict all the rights
which the _Congressmen_ regarded as having won through
the year-long struggle.

As a natural consequence of this, the question arose as
to who was violating the terms of the Pact. The government
and the Congress accused each other of violating it.
In the circumstances, Gandhi suggested that the only way
left for the government was to refer the issue to a tribunal.
But this was not acceptable to the government. Thus, the
relations between the two sides began to deteriorate more
and more.

This situation prevailed all over the country. But it
came up with greater importance in the Bardoli _taluk_ of
Gujarat, in UP and NWFP. In these areas, the friction
between the two was more acute.

These three provinces had one characteristic in common.
During the period of the _civil disobedience movement_, these
areas witnessed the growth of movements and organizations
based on the most broad based popular unity and the deep-rooted
day-to-day problems of the people. Along with this
common characteristic, each area had its own special features.
Frictions developed between the local officials and
the _Congressmen_ in each of these areas in different forms.
But because of their common character, these turned into a
friction at the all-India level, _i.e._, between Gandhi and
the authorities in Delhi.

The Bardoli _taluk_ was renowned for its peasant struggles.
We have already referred to the no-tax campaign
conducted there with the blessings of Gandhi and under the
direct leadership of Vallabhbhai Patel. It continued even in
the months after the launching of the _Salt Satyagraha_. But with
the _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_, the situation changed. Gandhi and the
Congress advised those who had refused to pay land tax
during the campaign to pay the arrears as much as possible.
At the same time, Gandhi brought to the notice of the authorities
that on account of the fall in the prices of agricultural
produce, the farmers might not be able to the pay the tax
arrears in full. He also made an appeal to authorities to
take into account the losses the peasants had to suffer as a
consequence of the _civil disobedience movement_.

He further reminded the authorities of the fact that
because of the persuasive efforts made by himself and his
colleagues, an amount Rs 2.1 million had been paid out of
Rs 2.2 million due from the _taluk_ and so it would be wrong to
resort to repressive measures to collect the balance. He further
pointed out that the government had already given concessions
to the tune of more than a lakh of rupees to the peasants
who had not taken part in the movement considering
their financial difficulties and as such it would be an injustice
to take actions to collect this amount from those who had
participated in the movement. Therefore, he asked the
authorities to stop all actions to recover the amount.

The reply given by the provincial government was that
there were established rules and procedures to determine to
whom and on what reasons remission of current tax or tax
arrears might be allowed. The government's stand was that
the remissions allowed earlier were in accordance with these
rules and procedures and that they were yet prepared to
allow it to those who deserved it, again, in accordance with
these rules and procedures. The government also pointed
out that instead of trying to get tax remission to those who
deserved it in accordance with these rules and procedures,
the Congress was raising it as an issue of the relationship
between the Congress and government to which they could
not agree.

The situation in UP was different. An organized
peasant struggle as in Bardoli had not taken place there.
However, before and during the _Salt Satyagraha_ widespread
activities had been going on among the peasants. Jawaharlal
Nehru himself had actively participated in these activities.
(During the _Salt Satyagraha_, when he was released from jail
for a few weeks, he had set his attention mostly on peasants.)

Unlike in Bardoli, what worried the peasants and
Congress workers in UP was not the _Ryotwari_ system and
the land tax. The collection of rent and other oppressive
extractions by the big landlords, the _Zamindars_ and the
_Talukdars_, the dominant position these elements held in socio-cultural
fields and the suffering of the people under them
were the live issues in UP. That is, the peasant movement
in UP emerged not as much against exploitation in the
form of land tax by the government as in the case of Gujarat,
as against the all round exploitation and oppression by big
landlords like _Zamindars_ and _Talukdars_.

Nonetheless, this movement, too, was directed against
the British rule. For the _Zamindars_, _Talukdars_ and other
vested interests in the countryside constituted the social base
of the British rule in the areas. It was against this that the
Congress and the peasant movement under its leadership
directed its onslaught, as a natural consequence of which
the Congress was emerging as a militant mass movement
firmly entrenched in the millions of the countryside. So, it
was necessary for the British rulers to block this development
at any cost in the interest of their own existence.

The conditions in NWFP were still different. There,
an organized peasant movement as in Bardoli or UP had
not yet developed, nor was a form of struggle like the no-tax
campaign adopted. But, as pointed out earlier, mass
movements of the Pathans and other sections of the people
based on tribal fraternity had begun to rally under the banner
of the Congress. After the launching of the _Salt Satyagraha_
these tribal sections as a whole had been waging _anti-British_
struggles under the Congress. After the _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_,
their tribal organization, the '_Afghan Jirga_', was formally
affiliated to the Provincial Congress Committee, and the
'_Red Shirts_' under Ghaffar Khan to the Congress volunteer
force. Thus, the entire tribal people of the area became
an inseparable part of the Congress organization. The
political status of the Congress as an all-India organization
together with the tribal organization of the frontier region
made it a great political force in the region.

We have merely mentioned the situations prevailing in
these three regions in some detail. In other places too disputes
arose in one way or the other around the interpretation
of the terms of the Pact and the behaviour of the
authorities. Gandhi proposed that an impartial permanent
arbitration be constituted to settle all such disputes. The
main issues which were proposed to be referred to the board
were as follows:

1. Does picketing of liquor shops and liquor shop auctions
   include in picketing referred to in the terms of
   agreement?
2. Do the Provincial governments have the authority
   to specify the spot of picketing the liquor shops so as
   to keep them away from the immediate vicinity of
   the shops ?
3. Do the governments have the authority to restrict
   the number of picketers, thereby preventing them
   from picketing all the entrances to the shops.
4. Does the government have the authority to prevent
   peaceful picketing of the sale of liquor at the place
   and timing other than those for which licences were
   issued ?
5. Does it come within the authority of the government
   to demand and undertaking from the students who
   had participated in the _civil disobedience movement_
   to get re-entry into schools and colleges and from
   those who were denied pension and grants during the
   struggle for reinstating the pension and grants, that
   they would not participate in the _civil disobedience
   movement_s in future ?

Gandhi also proposed that the scope of meaning of the
different terms used in the terms of agreement and the usages
of such terms should also be left for arbitration.

The appeal made by Gandhi to the Government of India
for constituting a permanent arbitration board to settle the
disputes in respect of these issues and the appeal made to
the respective provincial governments to settle the disputes in
Bardoli and in UP were rejected. The result of exchanging
letters and holding negotiations for about three months
was disappointing. Therefore, on 11th August 1931 Gandhi
sent a telegram to the Viceroy in which he stated:

>I exceedingly regret to inform you that a letter from the
Bombay Government just received renders impossible my
departure for London. The letter raises issues of first
magnitude, as well as of facts as of law, and contends that
the Government must be the final judge on both. In naked
terms, this means that the Government should be both
the prosecutor and the judge with reference to matters
arising out of a contract to which they and the complainants
are parties. This is impossible for the Congress to
accept. When I read the Bombay Government's letter
together with Sri Malcolm Hailey's telegram received in
answer to my enquiry, and the reports of continuing harassment
in the UP, Frontier Province, and other Provinces,
they seem to me complete indication that I must not sail as
I promised. To communicate with you before coming to
a final decision, I have brought the foregoing facts to
your notice. I shall await reply before making an announcement.

The reply received from the Viceroy was not at all
satisfactory and on 13th August Gandhi conveyed to him his
final decision not to go to London. At the same time, the
_Congress Working Committee_ informed the lower committees
that with the decision not to participate in the _Round
Table Conference_, the _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_ should be considered
as non-operative, but they could continue with the
activities which they had been conducting so far until further
instructions.

Following this, Gandhi and the Congress leaders issued
statements explaining the reason for taking such a decision.
They blamed the government for adopting an approach
which, in effect, negated the understanding reached at the
time of signing the _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_. The response of
the government to the statement helped only to increase the
tension between the Congress and the government.

It was in these circumstances that the other delegates to
the _Round Table Conference_ embarked on their journey to
London. Malaviya and Sarojini Naidu, the two nominated
members, decided not to proceed to London in the circumstances
in which Gandhi would not attend the conference. (The
government had violated the earlier understanding that
Dr. Ansari also would be nominated.) Among the other representatives,
only Prabhashankar Pattani decided not to participate
in the conference because Gandhi was not attending it.

This created a new crisis. It was for holding a _Round
Table Conference_ with the Congress participation that the
government came forward for the _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_. Congress
and the _bourgeois_ leaders, of course, wanted to adopt
the path of negotiation and avoid a struggle as far as
possible. Hence, the moment it appeared that the government
and the Congress were drifting apart, attempts were made
once again to bring them together.

Thus, on 15th August, Gandhi, Vallabhbhai Patel,
Jawaharlal Nehru and Prabhashankar Pattani met the Viceroy
again. Following this, the government issued an official
communiqué. Gandhi and the top government officials exchanged
correspondence on the details of this communiqué,
leading Gandhi to retract his earlier decision and decide to
proceed to London.

An examination of the official communiqué and the
correspondence exchanged between Gandhi and the authorities
would reveal one thing: On none of the issues raised by
Gandhi after the Karachi Conference did the government
accept the terms to the satisfaction of the ordinary _Congressmen_
or to the people at large. It was not that Gandhi saw
any "change of heart" in the government which motivated
him to go to London. As Gandhi had made it clear at the
time of signing the Pact with Lord Irwin, the Congress had
consciously decided to adopt the path of negotiations at least
for the time being. Accordingly, any statement from the
authorities, however inconsequential, which would pave the
way for Gandhi's journey to London must be seized upon.
There was no other justification for this second compromise.

## THE _SECOND ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE_

The _Second Round Table Conference_ had been formally
started even before Gandhi and his colleagues reached
London. After the plenary session, the delegates had been
divided into different committees. It was in these committees
that discussions were really held.

The subject of discussion in one committee was the
form of federal set up in future India. Another one was to
go into the different aspects of the main problem relating to
the position the minority communities should have in the new
administrative set up. The discussions in these two committees
were of the utmost importance. Consequently, Gandhi
was a member of both these committees. And it was in
the proceedings of these committees that he actively participated.

Before examining the discussions held at different levels
and in different committees as well as the conclusions that
emerged from these discussions, it is necessary to look back
into the fundamental transformations that the British politics
and the economy had undergone. The _Labour Party_ which
was in power during the _First Round Table Conference_
and the _Gandhi-Irwin Pact_ went out of power in the middle
of 1931. MacDonald, who was the _Labour Party_'s Prime
Minister, and few of his colleagues left the Party, and joined
hands with the Conservatives to form a new government.
MacDonald was formally the Prime Minister of that
government also. But most of his former colleagues (_Labour
Party_ ministers) were in the opposition. In their place,
ministers belonging to the Conservative Party were installed.
Wedgwood Benn of the _Labour Party_ who was the
Secretary of States for India was replaced by Sir Samuel
Hoare of the Conservative Party.

What led to the change of government was the deep
economic crisis which had affected the capitalist world in
general and Britain in particular. We have already referred
to the economic crisis which began in 1929 which had
affected Britain very acutely. Goods piled up unsold,
factories remained closed and millions of workers were out
of employment. The adverse balance of payment became
a grave problem. As a natural consequence of these and as
a temporary solution to the difficulty arising from this, the
pound sterling was de-linked from the gold standard.

A majority of the members in the _Labour Party_ was
opposed to this policy of their leader, MacDonald, for they
feared that it would inevitably lead to rise in the cost of
living of the workers and that the capitalists and the government
would come out heavily against them. It was precisely
for this reason that the Conservative Party decided to lend
support to the Prime Minister and his colleagues who adopted
this policy. Thus, it was, in fact, a Conservative government
under the leadership of a (former) Labourite Prime
Minister. It is but natural to expect such a government to
pursue a policy against the freedom lovers in India as well
as against the working class in England.

Some historians hold the view that but for this change
in government, the _Second Round Table Conference_ would
have proved much more useful. But that was not the fact.
It may be noted that the _First Round Table Conference_ was
held when the _Labour Party_ was in power. Yet the British
rulers utilized the Conference as a platform to rally the
princes, organizations and parties which indulged in communal-caste
politics, and isolated individuals with no following
against the Congress. The _Second Round Table Conference_
in which the Congress was brought in was but a continuation
of the first.

Moreover, it was a _Labour Party_ government with MacDonald
as Prime Minister and Wedgwood Benn as Secretary
of State for India that tried to suppress the _Salt Satyagraha_
and the subsequent struggle as forcibly as a Conservative
government would have done. On the other hand, only after
realizing that the freedom movement under the leadership of
the Congress could not be suppressed even by the most
repressive actions and that any _round table conference_ without
the participation of the Congress would only end in a
failure, did the then _Labour Party_ Government decide to
bargain with Gandhi. But this new policy had the support
of the Conservative Party.

The well-known journalist Durga Das, who was in
London during the months immediately before the _Second Round Table Conference_ has given in his memoirs the talks
he had with the former Conservative Prime Minister Stanley
Baldwin (who later became the leader of the Opposition) and
the _Labour Party_ leader, Attlee.

The statement made by Viceroy Lord Irwin as directed
by the _Labour Party_ government on India's right to _Dominion
status_ had the support of Baldwin. As Atlee had told
Durga Das, "Baldwin's heart was with the _Labour Party_".
With this background in mind, Durga Das wrote on his
conversation with Baldwin, as follows:

>Baldwin traced the hostile climate to the hurt inflicted on
>Lancashire's textile industry by the Congress through its
>_boycott_ of British goods. The financial crisis precipitated
>in Britain by World War I had been aggravated by this
>_boycott_. The burden of Empire, he admitted candidly,
>was becoming more and more oppressive. It was more
>than likely that before long Britain would be compelled by
>sheer necessity to cut her losses.
>
>India, Baldwin declared reflectively, might secure _self-government_
>much earlier than anybody now thought
>possible. ... He himself was convinced of the need for a
>meaningful dialogue with the Congress. He would urge the
>the Indian leaders to employ to the maximum advantage
>whatever instruments were available to them now and
>whatever others were placed at their disposal under the
>coming reforms.[^15/3]

[^15/3]: Durga Das, _India: From Curzon to Nehru and After_, London, Collins, 1969, pp. 153--154.

Along with this, Baldwin gave another piece of advice
to Indian leaders: Reach a compromise with the Muslims.
It was the aloofness of the Muslims, for reasons which may
be real or imaginary, that would be used by the British
enemies of India's _self-rule_.

Two things became evident from the views expressed by
Baldwin, who was the spokesman of _monopoly Capitalism_
and also a realistic political leader. First, when the position
of Britain in the capitalist world had eroded and the Indian
freedom movement had strengthened, any attempt to keep
India under its iron thumb would be a disadvantage rather
than an advantage for the British ruling class. Second, the
British ruling class was striving to protect their interests in
India as much as possible, making use of the claims of Muslims
and others.

In this respect there was no fundamental difference
between the Labour and Conservative parties. Like the _Labour
Party_, the Conservative Party also was of the opinion
that efforts must be made to come to terms with the Congress
by bargaining with them on the principle of _self-rule_ for
India. The _Labour Party_ was equally interested in protecting
the vital interests of Britain in India while arriving at
any settlement. Both parties look upon the native princes,
the Muslim, Christian, Anglo-Indian and European communal
bigwigs and liberal political leaders as social forces
helpful in implementing the basic policy which both the
parties equally accept. Again, there was absolutely no
difference between the two parties in creating the impression
that the Indian question remained unresolved not because
they were unwilling to give up power but because of the
opposition from the above-mentioned sections.

There is, however, no denying the fact that there were
minor differences between the Labour government and the
Conservative government on the practical steps they took in
implementing this common policy. But the policy that the
_Labour party_ and its government pursued in relation to the
British working class as well as the Indian people was, in
the final analysis, one of protecting the class interests of the
British monopolists.

Right from the early years of the 20th century when,
under the leadership of Tilak and his colleagues the objective
of _Swaraj_ was adopted and the means of struggle to achieve
it were evolved, the British rulers had been pursuing the
policy of rallying the Muslim communal leaders and the bigwigs
of other minorities as well as the 'moderate' politicians
against the Congress. Not only the earlier Conservative and
Liberal governments but also the Labour government
which came to power later, consistently followed these
same tactics. What was witnessed in the _Round Table
Conference_ was only a new revised edition of this strategy.

As against this, the Congress adopted a two-pronged
counter-strategy: (1) to organize the people on a large scale
under its own flag to bring the necessary pressure on Britain
to make them accept the Indian demand of _Swaraj_ and
bargain with the British from the position of this organized
mass strength, and (2) simultaneously try to negotiate with
leaders of the Muslim and other minority communities in
order to find a solution to the minority problem acceptable to
them.

What was witnessed at the _Second Round Table Conference_
was a clash between these two policies being pursued by
the rulers and the Congress. The authorities argued that the
transfer of power to the Indian hands was impossible without
solving the "_Muslim question_" which had been there for the
past quarter of a century and also without a guarantee that
the interests of the Christians, Anglo-Indians, European
traders and the depressed communities would be protected.
Gandhi, on the other hand, argued that the main question
was not that of the minority communities but the unwillingness
to give up power on the part of the government. Besides,
each side competed for making the leaders of the minority
communities accept its view-point .The _Second Round Table
Conference_ was a scene of this competition.

In the midst of this controversy, the speeches made by
Gandhi in the Constitution Committee and the Minorities
Committee reflected clearly the position of _bourgeois_ leadership
which the Congress represented. Only certain relevant
points are summarised as follows.

1. The need of the day was not the preparation of a
   political constitution as Britain wanted to do, but to decide
   on the conditions for co-operations between India and Britain
   as two independent nations.
2. All other delegates were arguing for their respective
   communities or sections but he and the Congress which he
   represented were arguing for the entire Indian people.
3. All the proposals put forward by the government were
   intended to evade the vital issue of transfer of power to
   peoples' representatives in the name of minority communities.
   The talk of the authorities who were unwilling to part
   with power, of the share of the minority communities was
   like a talk of sharing a corpse.
4. Gandhi claimed that he was also arguing for the
   _Princely States_. He made it clear that the policy of the
   Congress was not to participate in the internal political struggles
   in the _Princely States_. Accusing the British government
   of refusing to part with power on the pretext of safeguarding
   the interests of the princes, Gandhi urged for the latter's
   co-operation.
5. Gandhi pointed out that he could understand the
   claims of other minority communities, but not those which
   were raised in the name of the depressed communities. The
   Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and others would continue to
   remain as separate religion groups. He asked his opponents
   whether they wanted the depressed communities to remain
   depressed in perpetuity. Gandhi stated:

>I would far rather that Hinduism die than that untouchability
lived. I will not bargain away their rights for their
kingdom of the whole world. Those who speak of political
rights of untouchables do not know India, do not know
how Indian society is today constructed, and, therefore,
I want to say with all emphasis that I can command, that
if I was the only person to resist this thing, I would resist
it with my life.

With all his persuasive speeches in the different committees,
Gandhi could not influence the direction of the _Round
Table Conference_. The representatives of the minority
communities, including the Depressed Castes, signed a joint
statement. It was a document which enumerated the demands
of each of the minority communities and pledging support to
the claims of each by all others. This was not acceptable to
Gandhi, nor was Gandhi's proposal to them.

In the circumstances, the proceedings of the Conference
as a whole were dead-locked making it evident that there was
no use in continuing it. MacDonald told the Conference that
if each representative gave him in writing their willingness
to abide by his decision on issues which the delegates could
not solve by mutual discussions, he was willing to mediate
in the matter. Gandhi said he was willing to accept his
mediation if it was confined to the problems of the Muslim
and Sikh communities. But the government was not willing
to accept Gandhi's proposal.

Thus, the conference ended without coming to any decision
and Gandhi returned home empty-handed. The authorities
were to make a world-wide propaganda that the conference
failed because Gandhi and the Congress could not solve
the problems of the minority communities.
