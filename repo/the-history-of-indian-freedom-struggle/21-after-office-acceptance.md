# AFTER OFFICE ACCEPTANCE

## THE _CONGRESS-LEAGUE_ RELATION

We have noted earlier that the Muslims were not
represented in the election by a single political party,
but by a number of organizations, parties and individuals.
The general picture of Muslim politics that presented itself
during the elections consisted of several organizations and
individuals among whom some were close to the Congress
and others opposed to it and receiving assistance from the
British government for that reason. This situation continued
even when the formation of ministries became a live issue.
In the Muslim majority provinces where the Congress met
with a number of electoral reverses, there was no single
political party of the Muslims capable of forming ministries.
It was not the _Muslim League_ but the _Krishak Praja Party_
and the _Unionist Party_ that formed ministries in Bengal and
Punjab, respectively, with support of other groups in the
legislatures. The _League_ had contested only a few seats
because it lacked the confidence of winning the elections.
So, the question of leaders of the _Muslim League_ forming
ministries did not arise.

However, the attitude of the Congress towards forming
ministries and the discussions held between the Congress and
certain Muslim organizations which were regarded nationalist
brought about a change in this situation. A situation began to
develop in which the _Muslim League_ which was only one of the
parties of the Muslims claimed itself to be the sole representative
of the Muslims. It was later alleged and repeated in
the posthumously published memoirs of Maulana Azad that
what led to the growth of the _Muslim League_ was the "rigid
attitude" adopted by the Congress in general and its president
Nehru in particular in regard to the formation of ministries.

In order to understand the truth of the matter, it is
necessary to look back to the Muslim politics at the time of
the elections. The capacity of the Congress to approach
the Muslim voters was limited. Among the Muslim majority
provinces, the Congress was strong only in the NWF Province.
In many areas there were a number of Muslim leaders who
wanted to maintain good relations with the Congress. _Jamiat-ul-Ulema_
was the powerful organization of such leaders.
Besides, the leaders of the Muslim organizations including
the _Muslim league_ were formerly the active workers of the
Congress. Like Jinnah, these leaders also were organizing
Muslims on the basis of 'moderate' politics and were in agreement
with the Congress on all issues except on the question
of Muslim representation in the new constitution.

There were also certain other Muslim parties almost in
all provinces representing the big landlords among the Muslims.
With the assistance of the British they were striving to
mobilize the Muslim masses against the Congress as well as
against the Muslim parties like the _League_, the _Jamiat-ul-Ulema_,
etc. Consequently, many Muslim parties including the
_League_ had reached some kind of informal understanding
with the Congress. It was partly as a result of this that the
Congress decided to contest only a few seats reserved for the
Muslims. This was mainly in the NWF Province.

Even at this stage there were frictions between the
'moderate' Muslim leaders like Jinnah and the Congress
leaders like Nehru. It was but natural that the general Congress
policy of fighting against the landlords and other
reactionary forces in order to wipe out hunger and poverty
and the Congress election manifesto were allergic to the
'moderate' Muslim politicians. Moreover, Nehru had repeatedly
stated during the election campaign that the caste-communal
politics was a product of the reactionary social
forces and that the demand of communal representation in
which the common people of all castes and religions had no
interest at all was of benefit to a handful of bigwigs among
them. Jinnah could not but contest these arguments.

Thus, even Jinnah who, as compared to many other
Muslim leaders, had been able to reconcile with Congress
raised voice against the approach of the _anti-imperialist_ front
represented by Nehru in his election campaign.

The situation became more complicated after the elections.
In the United Provinces where the Muslims constituted a
considerable force, the _Muslim League_ was led by a former
Congress worker, Choudhury Khaliquzzmam who held political
negotiations with the Congress leaders Govind Ballabh
Pant and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai. As a result of these negotiations,
Khaliquzzman rejected the offer of joining the minority
"interim" government of the loyalists in the province. The
informal understanding reached between the Congress and
the _Muslim League_ was that the _League_ would be a partner in
the government when the Congress formed its ministry after
ending the deadlock in connection with office acceptance.

However, this raised a controversy in the Congress
leadership. Many prominent Congress leaders including
Nehru and Azad were opposed to the understanding with the
League. Following discussions held within the Congress
leadership, it was finally decided to take ministers from the
_league_ under certain conditions. These conditions were as
follows.

1. The _Muslim League_ in the UP Assembly should
   not function as a separate group. Their members should join
   the _Congress Parliamentary Party_. Like other members of
   the _Congress Parliamentary Party_, they should function
   subject of the discipline of the Congress.
2. The _Parliamentary Board_ of the _League_ in UP
   should be dissolved and the _League_ members should work
   for the success of the Congress candidates in the future by elections.
3. In case the Congress decided to resign form the
   ministry or legislature,the _League_ members should follow suit.

These conditions were not acceptable to the _League_.
They meant that the members of the _League_ should become
_Congressmen_. Not only did the attempts to form a coalition
government in UP fail, but the _League_ leaders charged the
Congress leaders with trying to foist Congress domination
over the Muslims.

Its repercussions were not confined to UP alone. A
Country-wide campaign was conducted that the "Hindu
Congress" was trying to thrust its domination on Muslims
and other minorities. The case of UP was cited as an
example to show that the Congress was trying to establish
its single party rule without allowing the true representatives
of the Muslim community to participate in the ministry, even
after it had become clear that the Congress lacked the support
of the Muslims. The Muslims leaders, including Jinnah,
created the feeling among the Muslim community that its
political organizations should unite to defeat the Congress
design to establish Hindu domination.

As a direct consequence of this, the Muslim leaders
belonging to different organizations till then decided to join
the _League_. The _Unionist Party_ leader Sikander Hayat Khan,
the _Krishak Praja Party_ leader Fazlul Huq, Muhammad
Saadulla of Assam and others called upon their partymen to
join the _League_. All these were done in deference to the
call given by Jinnah to the Muslims to organize themselves
against the Hindu domination of the Congress and to regard
the _League_ the organization of their own. They resisted
what they considered to be "anti-Muslim" actions taken by
the Congress ministries in the different provinces and
organized the Muslim masses against them.

These activities that continued for three years from 1937
raised the _Muslim League_ to a new status. Like the Congress
which entered into negotiations with the government and
other political parties claiming itself to be the sole representative
of the Indian people, the _League_ now started negotiating
with the Congress as the party representing the Indian
Muslims. In order to bring pressure to bear on these negotiations,
the _League_ also organized various struggles. This
ultimately led the _League_ in 1940 to adopt the 'Pakistan
resolution' at Lahore.

There are some who hold that this situation could have
been avoided, had the Congress not taken such an adamant
attitude with regard to the formation of the ministry in UP
and evaluate the subsequent events accordingly. The developments
with regard to the origin and growth of the Congress
and the _Muslim League_, and the conflicts and compromises
between them as explained in the earlier chapters would show
that this is incorrect. It may be recalled that the _bourgeois_
section among the Muslims formed its own political organization
(the _Muslim League_) when the Congress (_bourgeois_)
leadership gathered enough strength to demand _Swaraj_ as
its political objective. Then the question was what share the
Muslim _bourgeoisie_ would get in the _Swaraj_. When the
Indian _bourgeoisie_ began to fight adopting different means
to achieve its objective, the Muslim _bourgeoisie_ began to do
the same. This was basic to the _Congress-League_ relations
which took different forms at different stages.

The _Congress-League_ conflicts in the initial period
(1906--1916); the _Lucknow Pact_ between them in 1916; the
_Khilafat_ movement which grew as part of Gandhi's _non-cooperation_
movement; the conflict between them following
the failure of the movement; the cooperation among the
Jinnah group, the 'moderates' and the Congress in the Central
legislature; the _Congress-League_ split on the question of
Gandhi's _civil disobedience movement_ and the _Round Table
Conferences_; cooperation between the Congress and the
_League_ once again, to a lesser extent though, following the
adoption of parliamentary programme by the Congress --- these
constitute the general picture of the _Congress-League_ relation.

In other words, a particular section of the _bourgeoisie_
belonging to the Muslim community was getting strengthened
as part of the Indian _bourgeoisie_ politically as well as socially
and economically. This was a conflict between two sections
of the _bourgeoisie_ which were equally interested in acquiring
power from the British, a conflict on the question of sharing
political power.

The elections to the provincial legislatures held in 1937
constitute an evidence to show the extent to which the Indian
_bourgeoisie_ in general and its component Muslim _bourgeoisie_
in particular had been able to make progress. The Indian
_bourgeoisie_ as a whole had been engaged in the task of deriving
maximum benefit out of the provincial autonomy incorporated
in the new constitution and also of gaining political
power at the Centre. The Muslim _bourgeoisie_, on the
other hand, had been trying to maximize their share of power.
It was this effort that appeared in the form of the urgent
demand of forming a _Congress-League_ coalition government
in 1937. It was the same that led the _Muslim League_ to raise
the slogan of Pakistan in the sense of dividing India into
"Hindu India" and "Muslim India" and dividing power
between the _bourgeoisie_ in the respective sectors.

It is meaningful that the need for a unified all-India
leadership for the Muslims was felt when it became clear
that the majority everywhere except in the Muslim majority
regions and consequently the political power in the provinces
passed into the Congress. The proposal for a _CongressLeague_
coalition was an expression of this desire. Just as
the Congress asked the British to accept its claim to represent
the Indian people, so the _Muslim League_ demanded the Congress
and the government to accept its claim to represent the
Muslim community.

This was a challenge to the claim made by the Congress
that it represented the entire Indian people. Similarly, the
support received by the Congress in regions like the NWF
Province and the programme of "mass contact" adopted by
the Congress to extend this support to other regions constituted
a challenge to the claim made by the _League_.

The stand taken by the _League_ leaders was that the
Congress and the _League_ were the organizations of the Hindus
and Muslims, respectively, and that they together should
settle accounts with the British and acquire the rights of the
Indian _bourgeoisie_. If this were conceded, then Congress
would cease to exist politically. That was why the Congress
demanded dissolution of the _League Parliamentary Party_ in
return to the induction of _League_ members in the ministry.
If this was accepted, then the _League_ would cease to exist.
That was why the _League_ leaders rejected this proposal.
In otherwords, basic to the rise of the _Muslim League_ during 1937--1940 was the division and in-fighting within the Indian
_bourgeoisie_.

## THE NEW POPULAR UPSURGE

The formation of Congress ministries in seven provinces
first and coalition ministries with Congress partnership later
in Assam and NWF Province gave rise to optimism among
the people throughout the country. People believed that the
now governments would bring measures against the vested
interests as envisaged in the Karachi-Faizpur Congress resolutions
and the Congress election manifesto. However, the
ministers and the Congress leaders did not act in accordance
with the aspirations of the people and even went against
them. They, in fact, took a number of actions against ordinary
_Congressmen_ and other political workers as well as
their supporters. Most ministries functioned in a manner in
which the ministers came to terms with the Governors,
British civilian officials and the vested interests.

Nehru expressed his protest and opposition to this state
of affairs, but with no effect. Gandhi who had ceased to be
even a four-_anna_ member of the Congress was standing firmly
behind the ministers and other right-wing Congress leaders.
Nehru was not prepared to raise his voice against Gandhi.
Nehru's biographer stated:

>...On the whole, the record of the Congress ministries
was, as Jawaharlal Nehru realized soon enough, static if
not counter-revolutionary. The worst cases were Bombay
and Madras. There was no question now of taking office
to combat the new Act; the ministers worked in close
cooperation with the Governors, and in carrying out minor
reforms forgot the major issues. Soon after they took office,
Jawaharlal, as Congress president, directed them to release
all political prisoners. Govind Ballabh Pant's first act on
taking charge in the UP was to sit down at his office
table to write the order for their discharge. But KM
Munshi, the Home Minister of Bombay, 'if anything more
royalist than the king', ignored his directive. Keen to
detain Communist and left-wing leaders, he asked a surprised
Viceroy to put the CID[^cid] of Bengal in touch with
his own CID to deal with Communists in and around
Bombay. When Jawaharlal rebuked Munshi for his zeal
in this matter --- 'you have already become a police officer'
 --- Munshi appealed to the higher authority of Gandhi and
continued as before. Jawaharlal protested in the _Working
Committee_ that the Congress ministers appeared more
concerned about the effect their actions would have upon
the British Government than upon their own people; but
his arguments had no effect.[^21/1]

[^cid]: Crime Investigation Department is the branch of a police force to which most plainclothes detectives.

[^21/1]: Sarvepally Gopal, _Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography_, Vol. I, Bombay,
Oxford University Press, 1976, pp. 229--230.

S Gopal also refers to BG Kher and C Rajagopalachari,
the Chief Ministers of Bombay and Madras, respectively.
Lord Linlithgow, the Viceroy, had advised the Bombay
Governor Lord Brabourne in a letter: "My advice to you,
for what it is worth, would be, here and elsewhere, to play
for time and to miss no chance of impressing Kher and his
colleagues with a sense of their own importance and of the
necessity for standing on their own legs." Dr. Gopal further
quotes what Lord Erskine, the Governor of Madras, "a diehard
Tory himself", recorded about Rajagopalachari: "In
fact, he is even too much of a Tory for me, for though I
may not go back twenty years, he wishes to go back two
thousand and to run India as it was run in the time of King
Asoka."[^21/2]

[^21/2]: _Ibid_, pp. 230--231.

The first issue on which the Congress ministries and the
left movement clashed was the release of political prisoners
and keeping in abeyance the repressive laws. In many provinces,
including Bombay and Madras, repressive actions
against political workers were revived. Without inhibition
the Congress governments resorted to such measures as
suppression of leftist newspapers and printing presses which
was the order of the day under the British. Instead of releasing
political prisoners, the Congress governments put more
inside jails.

Not only the activists of the left parties and the Congress
but also Congress committees (including leaders like
Nehru and Bose) raised their voice against these actions.
But that did not make any effect. The Congress ministers
continued to act according to their whims with the open
support of Gandhi. Nehru acquiesced in it in the name of
'Congress discipline'. "We cannot agitate against ourselves",
he said.

But facing these and other repressive actions, the agitations
and struggles of workers, peasants and students were
advancing. Communists and Socialists were ceaselessly working
to give these struggles an organized form, thereby
strengthening the _anti-imperialist_ front. Many Congress
committees too participated in these activities.

The strike launched by the workers of a British-owned
textile mill in Kanpur in July 1937 for increased wages and
for recognition of their union was a brilliant example of
such struggles. Although the Communists and Socialists were
in the forefront organizing and guiding the strike, the local
Congress Committee played an active role in it. Consequently,
it developed into a general strike of all workers in and
around Kanpur. Under its pressure, the UP Government
appointed an enquiry committee with Rajendra Prasad as
chairman to go into the demands of the workers. The report
it submitted conceded many demands of the workers.

The Kanpur strike became a model for worker's actions
throughout the country. It also helped to make _anti-imperialists_
all over India aware of the outcome if Communists,
Socialists and ordinary _Congressmen_ stood united in serving
and helping the workers. Following this, there was a wave
of strike struggles all over the country under the pressure of
which Congress governments in many states appointed committees
to enquire into workers problems and demands.
Feeling the wind of change many capitalists conceded the
demands of the workers to avoid strikes. There were others
who were not prepared to follow this path. In those industries
workers struck work which was supported by all political
parties including the Congress, compelling the Congress
governments to take action to make the capitalists concede
the workers' demands. More than 50 percent of the strikes
in 1937--39 was partly or fully successful.

These strikes were reflected in the number as well as in
the membership of trade unions which showed a big increase.
The number of unions went up from 241 in 1936 to 562
in 1939 and the membership from 268,000 to 390,000. The
increase was mainly in Bengal, Madras, Punjab and UP.
Among the trade unions it was the _AITUC_ under the leftist
leadership that took great strides. Its 71 affiliated unions
with 51,600 members in May 1936 rose to 193 unions with 348,000 members by February 1940. On the other hand,
the _National Trade Union Federation_ and its affiliated unions
led by the 'moderates' were weakened. Fearing isolation from
the working class its leadership decided in January 1938 to
merge their organization with the _AITUC_.

This advance of the working class flabbergasted the
Congress ministers and other right-wing leaders. In order to
stop this advance, they started taking repressive actions,
which was at its worst in Bombay. Apart from _lathi-charges_
and other acts of repression, they prepared a bill incorporating
most undemocratic provisions with regard to recognition
of trade unions. Strikes against this "Black Act" and in
defence of the immediate demands of the workers became
widespread. The impact of these actions was felt in the
Congress as well. Not only the ordinary Congress workers
and the local Congress committees but also the provincial
committees came out against the approach of the Congress
ministers.

This was also a period of peasant agitations and
struggles. The elections to the provincial legislatures were
held within a year of the formation of _All-India Kisan
Sabha_. As a result of the activities of the _Kisan Sabha_ and
also because of the declarations made by the Congress,
thousands of activists had entered in the midst of the peasants.
Even from among the ranks of the peasantry thousands
of militant workers had started rising. Mass meetings,
demonstrations and marches were held all over the country
demanding the Congress ministries to reduce rent, scale down
debt burdens and stop evictions as assured in the Congress
election manifesto and in the Faizpur resolution. The _Kisan
Sabha_ membership rose from 600,000 in May 1938 to 800,000 in 1939.

It must be noted that there was a fundamental difference
between this new peasant upsurge and the one witnessed
earlier under Gandhi's leadership. It was as part of the
National movement under the _bourgeois_ leadership that peasant
went into action when Gandhi gave a call. It was true that
there were tens of thousands of militant workers among
them. But Gandhi was not prepared to fan their fighting
spirit into a revolutionary fire. On the contrary, the Gandhian
method of struggle in those days which was anchored on
"_non-violence_", was an attempt to tie down the peasantry to
the confines of _bourgeois_ nationalism. In contrast to this,
an independent organization (the _Kisan Sabha_) of a revolutionary
class had emerged now,which, though cooperating with
the _bourgeois_ national movement, was functioning independent
of it and making its own contributions to the _anti-imperialist_
movement. Like the working class, the peasantry had adopted
as their own the _Red Flag_, _May Day_, etc., which are the
symbols of Socialist revolution. On such matters they showed
no hesitation in coming into a clash with the _bourgeois_
leadership of the Congress. As a matter of fact, the growth
of the _Kisan Sabha_ in the provinces where the Congress
ministries were in office and the role played by ordinary
_Congressmen_ and the Congress committees at the lower level
in its growth had disturbed the Congress ministers and the
right-wing Congress leaders. So, the higher Congress committees
mounted a political attack on the _Kisan Sabha_. They
directed that _Congressmen_ should not participate in the
activities of the _Kisan Sabha_. They asserted that the leadership
being given by the _Kisan Sabha_ and its activists in
organizing resistance to the violence let loose by the _Zamindars_
or the big landlords was "against the creed of _non-violence_
of the Congress". Not satisfied with this political
attack, they unhesitatingly took actions against the activists
of the _Kisan Sabha_ using the provisions of the existing repressive
laws.

However, they realized that this alone could not
contain the peasant movement. Therefore, they tried
to placate the peasants by conceding some of their demands
and making preparations for legislations to this effect, which
went in parallel to the repressive actions. Thus, in many
provinces the Congress governments appointed committees
to enquire and report on legislative measures to be introduced
with a view to ending _Zamindari_ and other land-ownership
systems.

The reports of most of these committees were extremely
'moderate' in content. Moreover, the Second World War broke
out and the Congress ministries resigned before initiating
legislative work based on these reports. Thus, these reports
did not benefit the peasantry in any way. However, it became
clear that the peasants, like the working class, could form
their own organizations and agitate and fight under the
banner of these organizations compelling the Congress ministries
to take actions favourable to them. This brought out
another important face of the _anti-imperialist_ front.

The _All-India Students Federation_ which was founded
in 1936 under the leadership of Communists and _Congress
Socialists_ also made similar progress in the years following
the formation of Congress ministries in the provinces. For
examples its membership increased from 40,000 in 1938 to 100,000 in 1939. This progress of the students' movement --- yet
another face of the _anti-imperialist_ front --- was achieved
against the wishes of the right-wing Congress leadership and
in spite of its opposition.

## MINISTRIES AND THE PEOPLE

The existence of the Congress ministries which took
office in July 1937 and the _non-Congress_ ministries in the
Congress minority provinces and also the 'interim ministries
which were in power in the Congress majority provinces
before the Congress decided to accept office enabled the
people to compare the Congress and _non-Congress_ ministries.
These _non-Congress_ ministries functioned more or less the
same way in which the Congress ministers functioned as in
charge of certain departments allocated to them in the provinces
in accordance with the 1919 _Reforms Act_. Therefore,
the coming into power of the Congress ministries had been
considered as the beginning of a new stage in the history
of Indian politics.

For about 18 years after Gandhi took over the leadership,
the Congress had been functioning as an organized opposition
to the British government. With the emergence of the
_Swaraj Party_, the Congress decided to extend its role of
opposition to the legislature. In 1930, it gave up the parliamentary
programme and became an opposition party functioning
only outside the legislature. A party which had been
thus functioning continuously as an opposition now in the
legislature, now outside the legislature, had taken office in
some provinces.

On a number of counts there were differences between
the Congress ministers and other ministers who had taken
office now. Some of these differences were conspicuous. For
example, the Congress decided that its ministers should not
draw a salary exceeding Rs 500 in deference to the resolution
adopted at the Karachi session. This was less than the
amount drawn by the _non-Congress_ ministers in other provinces
and the 'interim' ministers in the Congress majority
provinces. Further, the Congress ministers had followed the
Congress discipline and Gandhian way of life including habitually
wearing _khadi_. This made them distinct from other
ministers and created the impression that they took office
representing the _daridra narayans_ (poor).

A more basic change that had come about was that it was
made clear that though each ministry was functioning in a
particular province, it had to function as part of an all-India
organization and subject to its leadership and direction. The
Congress ministries had a common perspective and a common
programme giving clear and concrete directions in their day-to-day
functioning. There was a central organizational
leadership to supervise their functioning and to rectify the
mistake they committed in their functioning. This central organizational
leadership had the authority and capability to
reprimand and even to dismiss any ministry or minister who
disobeyed its directives. No _non-Congress_ ministry now in
power or an earlier ministry was subject to such a control.

Parties opposed to the Congress as well as the British
newspapers strongly criticized the functioning of the provincial
ministries under such a centralized political leadership. They
contended that it was undemocratic for an individual or
organization outside a province to be vested with powers
to interfere in the affairs of a ministry in that province.
The Congress leaders replied that the main political question
before India was that of the administration of the whole
country and not that how each province had to be administered.
The real question was how the administration of the
whole country including that at the Centre should be transferred
from the British to the Indians and how to effectively
carry on the struggle for the transfer of administration. The
Congress had taken over power in those provinces where
it had commanded a majority in the legislature only as part
of the process of organizing the people as a whole for the
purpose.

The _non-Congress_ ministries in other provinces had no
such perspectives and no such central leadership to control
and guide them. As distinct from them, the ministers of the
Congress who had adopted the political objective of uniting
the whole organization, perspective and method of struggle
must submit themselves to a centralized discipline.

The Congress which decided to exercise full control
over its ministries evolved a form of organization suited for
this purpose. Before the elections it had formed a _Parliamentary Board_
to nominate the candidates to contest elections
and to carry on the organizational work in connection with
the elections. After the elections it formed a Parliamentary
Sub-committee consisting of Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra
Prasad and Abul Kalam Azad to control the ministries and
to give them guidance in their activities.

The very constitution of the Parliamentary Sub-committee
with Patel as chairman and with Rajendra Prasad, a
well-known right-wing leader, as a member, needs special
mention. It was during the presidency of Nehru, a known
leftist, that the _Parliamentary Board_ was formed with a
_rightist_ majority and with no place for Nehru in it. This
Board was to control the functioning of the ministries. This was
a clear evidence to show the correlation of forces inside the
Congress. Nehru to attract the masses and secure their votes,
and Patel to control the ministries after winning the elections --- such
was the division of labour inside the Congress.

Although Nehru was not a member of the _Parliamentary
Board_, he was a force to be reckoned with in the formation
of the ministries and in their functioning. Durga Das
describes how the choice of the Chief Minister was made in
UP, the home province of Nehru.

>(Pandit) Pant told me one day of how his Ministry came
to be formed. Purushottamdas Tandon was senior to Pant
but was dedicated to the cause of Indian Sanskriti (culture)
which appeared to Nehru and Rafi a reactionary outlook.
Tandon was senior to Nehru too, and in fact was among
the few who called him by his first name. Rafi manoeuvred
to get Tandon to accept the Speakership of the UP
Assembly and thus cleared the way for Pant ... to take
over as Chief Minister. Rafi, on his part, told me how
he had helped to insulate the Pant Ministry against "the
irritable criticism and interference of the unpredictable
Nehru". Pant and he waited on Nehru at his residence in
Allahabad and sought his blessings for the induction of
Mrs. Vijayalakshmi Pandit in the Ministry. Nehru, who
doted on his younger sister, readily agreed. This plan did
succeed to a very great extent, but still Nehru could not
help an occasional outburst.[^21/3]

[^21/3]: Durga Das, _India: From Curzon to Nehru and After_, London, Collins, 1969, p. 184.

With the formation of ministries Nehru began to drift
away from his colleagues. He was not able to reconcile himself
with the functioning of the ministries controlled by Patel
and other right-wing leaders. Sometimes he publicly expressed
his sentiments in this regard. For example, Durga Das has
recorded an incident in which Nehru got infuriated at a
meeting when Pant's peon entered clad in his official uniform.
He was restive of many omissions and commissions of the
Congress ministries. He had noted a tendency in the
Congress ministers to be on good terms with the British
civil officials rather than considering the ministry as an instrument
in the struggle against the administrative system imposed
by the British. Nehru's fury at the official uniform of Pant's
peon was symbolic of his opposition to this tendency.


If this was the plight of Nehru, it is needless to mention
that of the ordinary _Congressmen_. People had great expectations
form the Congress leaders after they assumed
ministership as the spokesmen and representatives of the
_daridra narayans_.

>The expectations of the populace were pitched in a high
key. When _Zamindars_ (big landlords) were almost all
defeated in the elections, a big revolution which had already
been in full swing, received an added impetus in the
_Zamindars_ for the revision of old tenures and taxes.
Agrarian relief, scaling down debts, removal of intermediaries
in cultivation, restriction of the extent of lands
possessed by absentee landlords, abolition of illegal exactions ...
these were the batch of Reforms which the popular
ministers had to address themselves to.[^21/4]

[^21/4]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _op. cit_, pp. 54--55. A number of items such as
total prohibition in the list of Sitaramayya have been left out here.

In other words, the people had expected that many of
the demands raised by the peasantry before and after the
formation of the _Kisan Sabha_ could be realized with the
emergence of the Congress ministries.

The _Communist Party_, _Congress Socialist Party_ and
the left-wing _Congressmen_ tried to give an organized form
to these expectations that arose among the peasants, workers
and other labouring masses. Attempts were made to make
the Congress implement a programme for social transformation.
They consciously utilized the freedom of activities which
became available with the formation of the Congress ministries
to organize mass agitations and to form trade unions
and peasant organizations. They transformed the very existence
of the ministries under the command of Sardar Patel
into conditions for the growth of the left movement. They
came forward to raise the demand that the promises made
to the people in the election manifesto and other official
documents of the Congress must be fulfilled.


This led to serious clashes. The leftists and the ordinary
_Congressmen_ had started feeling that the Congress leaders
who had now become ministers were not functioning in
accordance with the promises formally given by the Congress.
From the incident narrated by Durga Das it must be
understood that even Nehru had shared this feeling. Dr.
Gopal, Nehru's biographer, stated that having understood
that he would not be able to reconcile himself with the political
atmosphere arising out of the formation of Congress
ministries, Nehru "virtually opted out of the day-to-day activities
of the domestic politics" and engaged himself in developments
outside India.[^21/5]

[^21/5]: S. Gopal, _op. cit_, p. 232.

The Congress governments freely used the provisions of
those very repressive laws which the British government had
been using against the Congress earlier, against the activists
of mass organizations. Protests against these actions
came not only from the ranks of the Congress but also from
certain Congress committees in the different provinces.

In sum, the formation of the Congress ministries at one
and the same time helped the growth of the _bourgeoisie_ as
well as of the left revolutionary forces fighting against the
_bourgeoisie_. It also helped each of them to formulate their
respective strategy for _anti-imperialist_ struggles. For the first
time in the history of the Congress and of Indian politics,
there emerged a _bourgeois_ strategy of bargaining with the
imperialists both by making use of the administrative
machinery and by rallying the people under a well-trained
centralized leadership as well as a leadership (Patel and
others) to put this strategy into practice. On the other side,
a leftist political force basing itself on the strategy of revolutionary
struggles against the Congress strategy of bargain
began to emerge.

Nehru who aspired to remain on the side of these
revolutionary forces but kept himself away from the conflicts
between these two forces for want of mental strength was
used by Patel and his cohorts as an ornament that could be
placed at the top of their organization. The left forces which
were uncompromisingly opposing the right-wing strategy of
bargain with the British imperialists found another prominent
leftist leader --- Subhas Bose --- to stand with them at least for
the time being. It was in the background of an impending
clash between the left forces with Nehru and Bose on their
side, and the right-wing leadership under Patel and Rajendra
Prasad that the next annual session of the Congress was
held in Haripura.

## TOWARDS CRISIS

The Haripura session of the Congress was held in
February 1938 in the shadow of a political crisis that arose
from the resignation of the Bihar Chief Minister Srikrishna
Sinha and UP Chief Minister Govind Ballabh Pant. The
resignation was a sequel to the refusal of the Governors to
concur with the decisions of the cabinets of Bihar and UP
to release political prisoners. The question arose before
the delegates to the session whether this political crisis would
remain confined to these provinces. Doubts were expressed
whether the assessment of the political situation made by
the Congress at the time of formation of the ministries
following the political-legal controversy that lasted for three
months was correct, whether the Governors were interfering
in the functioning of the ministries or not and, if they were,
whether it was not proper for the Congress leadership to
direct other Congress Chief Ministers also to resign and lead
a country-wide struggle.

A situation was developing all over the country which
might turn this into a crucial political issue. In Bengal, well-known
for the valour and sacrifice displayed in the _anti-imperialist_
struggle, thousands of political workers were behind the
bars. The government there did not take any action to release
them. Instead, it was resorting to fresh repressive measures.
Similarly, a considerable number of political prisoners from
Bengal and other provinces had been banished to the Andaman
Islands. The Central government did not even consider the
question of releasing them. This naturally created deep discontent
and unrest among the people throughout the country.
It was in this context that the Congress governments of
Bihar and UP decided to release the political prisoners
under their jurisdiction. The interference of the governors
drew a storm of protest from the people.

However, neither the Congress nor the Congress Chief
Ministers wanted to bring the matters to a head. On the
contrary, they adopted an attitude which would facilitate a
compromise. Durga Das, who was the Lucknow correspondent
of the _Statesman_, has put it on record that the UP
Chief Minister Pant had drafted his resignation letter very
carefully making sure that it did not impire his relations with
the Governor and that he (Durga Das) helped Pant to soften
the tone and approach of the draft.

The resolution adopted by the Haripura session of the
Congress had made reference to an incident which drew
objections from the Governor of UP In order to bring out
the attitude of the Congress leadership towards the issue involved,
the relevant part of the resolution is given below:

>On behalf of the UP Governor it has been stated that
the demonstrations organised to welcome the Kakori prisoners
and the speeches delivered by some of them had
interfered with the policy of gradual release of political
prisoners. The Congress has always discouraged unseemly
demonstrations and other objectionable activities. The
demonstrations and speeches referred to by the UP
Governor were strongly disapproved by _Mahatma Gandhi_.
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, President of the Congress, had
similarly taken immediate notice of the indiscipline which
was thus betrayed. Nor were they ignored by the Ministers.
As a result of these corrective steps public opinion
rapidly changed and even the persons concerned came to
realise their mistake.[^21/6]

[^21/6]: Zaidi and Zaidi, _op. cit_, p. 437.

The resolution was an open admission that the objections
raised by the Governor were not entirely baseless as well as
an expression of the readiness on the part of the Congress leadership
to carry on matters according to the wishes of the
Governors. The conciliatory attitude expressed in the resolution
was in fact an appeal to the Governors not to interfere
with the functioning of the ministers. Furthermore, this
conciliatory attitude would not be limited to the question of
the release of political prisoners. As we have repeatedly
pointed out earlier, the Congress leadership was striving at
a compromise with the British authorities on all the issues
including the Federal system at the Centre in such a way as
to protect maximally its own class interests.

However, the British authorities were aware of the fact
that a considerable section within the Congress was working
uncompromisingly against this conciliatory attitude. The
actions taken by the Governors of Bihar and UP were
designed to test the strength of this section as well as the
willingness of the leadership to resist it and continue this
conciliatory attitude. The resolution adopted at the Haripura
session had moreover shown that the leadership was prepared
for compromise disregarding the leftists. The resolution had
specifically stated that:

>Congress Ministers have more
than once declared their determination to take adequate
action in the matter of violent crime. ...[^21/7]

[^21/7]: _Ibid_, p. 437.

Consequently, soon after the Haripura session ministerial
crisis in Bihar and UP were brought to an end.
The ministers who had resigned resumed office and the
statements and counter-statements were exchanged between
the ministers and the Governors for this purpose. But the
Haripura session marked the beginning of an intense struggle
within the Congress on several issues including the question
of the release of political prisoners:

>The commotions and the convulsions in national thought
during the two preceding years were largely conditioned by
the concepts of Socialism and Communism which travelled
afresh into the country, the conflicts that arose in 1938
must largely be put down as the off-shoots of the earlier
antagonisms that had been raging indeed for some years
past in the Congress annals. Here was Gandhi who though
not a member of the Congress was still the power behind the
throne, the fountain spring of all ideas of _constructive
nationalism_ and the architect of that mighty barrage which
helped to stem successfully the tide of violence. There were
the younger folks who felt impatient over the slow progress
of the ideas rooted in _non-violence_ and were hard put to
discover shortcuts to vertical heights or make long jumps
over impassable gulfs. The formation of Ministries in
particular did not achieve that millennium nor did the
popular governments help to hasten the advent of that far
off divine event, the emancipation of the _Kisans_.[^21/8]

[^21/8]: Pattabhi Sitaramayya, _op. cit_, p. 72.

The growth of the _Kisan Sabha_ became an issue of
heated controversy in the Haripura session. The fact that
its leadership was not with the Congress but with the Communists
and Socialists agitated the right-wing Congress leaders.
They launched a heavy attack on the _Kisan Sabha_ for it was
functioning independent of the Congress discipline and was
hoisting red flag in its meetings and demonstrations. The
resolution adopted at the Haripura session stated:

>In view of the difficulties that have arisen in regard to
the _Kisan Sabhas_ and other organizations in some parts
of India, the Congress desires to clarify the position and
state its attitude in regard to them. The Congress has
already fully recognised the right of _Kisans_ to organise
themselves in peasant unions. Nevertheless, it must be
remembered that the Congress itself is in the main a _Kisan_
organization and as contacts with the masses have increased,
vast numbers of _Kisans_ have joined it and influenced
its policy. The Congress must, and has in fact, stood for
these _Kisan_ masses and championed their claims, and has
worked for the independence of India which must be based
on the freedom from exploitation of all our people. ... While
fully recognising the right of the _Kisans_ to organise _Kisan
Sabhas_, the Congress cannot associate itself with any activities
which are incompatible with the basic principles of
the Congress and will not countenance any of the activities
of those _Congressmen_ who as members of the _Kisan Sabhas_
help in creating an atmosphere hostile to Congress principles
and policy. The Congress, therefore, calls upon
_Provincial Congress Committees_ to bear the above in mind
and in pursuance of it take suitable action wherever call
for.[^21/9]

[^21/9]: Zaidi and Zaidi, _op. cit_, pp. 438--439.

It becomes obvious from the resolution that the conflict
between the left and right-wings of the Congress were getting
intense and that the problem of the relationship between
the _Kisan Sabha_ and the Congress arose as a symbol of this
conflict. The complaint of the right-wing was that the leftists
were going ahead with programmes, which were not to
their liking, of propagating the ideologies of Socialism and
Communism among the people and organizing peasants in
the organizations independent of the Congress based on these
ideologies. The resolution was adopted after a heated debate
with a majority of votes.

_Kisan Sabhas_ had been organized under the leadership
of the leftists in all provinces where the Congress ministries
were in power. The agitations, struggles, and demonstrations
conducted by them under the red flag were a headache not
only to the big landlords and the British rulers but also to
the Congress ministers. It had become such a strong movement
that it could march ahead even if it was opposed by
all the right-wing Congress leaders including Gandhi. This
was the case not only with the _Kisan Sabha_ but also of the
trade unions and students organizations. The message of
Socialism and Communism had spread extensively in these
movements. The Communist and Socialist parties had been
growing in strength capable of leading them. Utilizing the
freedom of speech and press and other civil liberties in the
provinces where the Congress ministries were in power, the
left parties were also engaged in publishing newspapers and journals
and organizing meetings and demonstrations.

Changes were taking place in the old revolutionaries
giving a fresh impetus to these developments. A considerable
section of the prisoners in the different jails in India,
including in the Andaman Islands, were those who believed in
the politics of bomb. Acquaintance with the Communist and
Socialist literature and world political developments including
the rapid progress achieved by the Soviet Union made them
rethink politically. They began to realize that the kind of
revolution that had taken place in Russia and for which
many other countries were preparing, would take place in
India only by organizing the different sections of the people
and making them politically conscious, rather than by physically
eliminating the enemies of the people. Many who later
became prominent Communist leaders were those who had
adopted the ideology of Communism at this stage.

The statement signed by the former bomb politicians
renouncing the 'bomb politics' was interpreted by the right-wing
Congress leadership as evidence to the increasing influence
of the Gandhian philosophy of _non-violence_. It was,
in fact, a victory of Socialism and Communism because it
showed that the revolutionary forces inside and outside the
Congress had begun adopting the perspective of working on
the basis of organized revolutionary strength of the working
class, peasantry and other toiling people.

It was as part of the approach of the right-wing leadership
to stem the upswing of the left forces that they decided
to install the leftist Subhas Bose as the president of the
Congress at the Haripura session. We have seen that the
right-wing leadership was able to implement their own policies
under the shadow of Nehru who had been placed as an
ornament at the top of the Congress continuously for two
years. They hoped that they would be able to perform the
same feat under the presidentship of Bose as well. And this
calculation was not an entirely misplaced one. Bose did not
cause any "trouble" to the right-wing leadership during
his presidency.

But by the time of the next session, the Congress was
once again heading towards a split. The fierce controversy
that raged in the Haripura session on the question of the
relationship between the _Kisan Sabha_ and the Congress was
the first indication of the storm that was gathering.

## _PRINCELY STATES_ AND THE CONGRESS

Another important issue which came to be hotly
debated in the Haripura session was the attitude of the Congress
towards the struggles for democracy in the _Princely
States_. As in the case of many other issues, the left stood
firmly against the attitude of the right-wing leadership on this
issue. But unlike on most other issues, certain non-left sections
also expressed dissatisfaction over the stand taken by
the right-wing on this matter.

As we have noted earlier, the official position of the
Congress was that it would not participate in the popular
struggles for democracy in the _Princely States_. The contention
of those who formulated this policy was that since the
princes were sympathetic to the struggle against the British
rulers, the Congress should not function in a manner that
disconcerted them. But with the development of the _bourgeoisie_
in the _Princely States_ as it did in British India, activities
for establishing the democratic principles and values which
were upheld by the Congress began to take place in these
states at least on a lower key. Just like the Congress demanded
the transfer of power from the British rulers to Indian
_bourgeoisie_, so the demand came from the _Princely States_
that the autocratic rule be ended and the _bourgeois democratic_
system introduced.

Basically, the _bourgeois_ leadership of the Congress
should have been sympathetic to this demand. But considering
the consequences of joining hands with democratic movements
in the _Princely States_, the Congress turned its back
and adopted the policy "non-interference in the internal
affairs of the _Princely States_".

A change came about in this in the _Round Table Conferences_
and in the years following the Conferences. It
became clear that the princes were one of the main forces to
support the British in rejecting the national demand raised
by the Congress. Undoubtedly, those who would 'represent'
the autocratic _Princely States_ in the Federation would be the
henchmen of the rulers of these states. Therefore, in order
for the Congress to achieve its objective, it was essential
that there must be a basic change in the administrative set-up
in the _Princely States_. So, the Indian _bourgeoisie_ had to
raise the slogan of _responsible governments_ in the states
along with the demand of _full independence_ for India.

It was in these circumstances that democratic organizations --- _Praja
Mandals_ --- working for the establishment of
democracy in the _Princely States_ emerged. An all-India conference
was convened in July 1936 at Karachi with a view
to provide the various _Praja Mandals_ scattered all over the
country a uniform perspective. An all-India organization of
the states' organizations was formed at the conference. The
leaders of that organization appealed to the Congress for
moral and practical assistance to the struggles being conducted
in the states since they looked upon the Congress as an
organization which represented their aspirations.

Although the democratic movements in the _Princely
States_ were under the leadership of the _bourgeoisie_, the
approach of the leaders of these movements was different
from that of _bourgeois_ leadership of the Congress towards
the autocratic rules in the states. They believed that they deserved
the full support from a movement like the Congress.
On the contrary, the right-wing leadership of the Congress
feared that if they antagonized the rulers of the states by
giving direct support to democratic struggles in the states,
that would weaken the _national front_ against the British
rulers.

This difference in approach was found reflected in the
top leadership of the Congress. Not only Nehru and Bose
but also those right-wing Congress leaders who had at
least a remote relation with the _Princely States_ were of
the opinion that the Congress should reconsider its attitude
towards the struggles in the _Princely States_. As a result, the
_AICC_ meeting held in Calcutta in October 1937 adopted a
resolution declaring support to the struggles of the people of
Mysore against repression.

However, this was severely criticized by Gandhi who
maintained that although the struggles of the people of the
_Princely States_ for _responsible government_ was just, the
direct participation of the Congress would do harm to these
struggles. The Communists, Socialists and other leftists
showed that Gandhi's argument was basically wrong and
pointed out that his argument in fact amounted to conceding
the contention of the autocrats in the states that the Congress
was an "outsider" to their states. They also pointed out
that since it had become clear that the British were trying to
weaken the country wide _freedom struggle_ by differentiating
between "British India" and "Indian India", _responsible
governments_ in the _Princely States_ should also be brought
within the definition of _Purna Swaraj_.

At least on this issue a section of the right-wing leadership
joined hands with the left. They joined the left forces
to raise protest against the draft resolution prepared by the
_Working Committee_ to be placed before the _Subjects Committee_
of the Congress at Haripura. The draft had completely
prohibited formation and functioning of _Congress Committees_
in the states. Finally, a "compromise" resolution was adopted
at the Haripura session which included the following
paragraph.

>The Congress therefore directs that, for the present,
_Congress Committees_ in the States shall function under the
direction and control of the _Congress Working Committee_
and shall not engage in parliamentary activity or launch
on _direct action_ in the name and under the auspices of the
Congress. Internal struggles of the people of the states must
not be undertaken in the name of the Congress. For this
purpose independent organizations should be started and
continued where they exist already with in the State.[^21/10]

[^21/10]: Zaidi and Zaidi, _op. cit_, p. 434.

That this 'compromise' resolution did not have an iota
of compromise would be clear to anyone who has read it.
Open struggle and parliamentary work are two facets of
political work. The compromise' here was that the right-wing
leadership had no objection to forming Congress
committees _sans_ these two facets of political work. This
meant that no "outsider" should interfere in the internal
affairs of the _Princely States_, that _Congress Committees_ are
"outside" organizations for the _Princely States_ and that they
should keep aloof from the conflicts between the subjects
and rulers of these states. Thus, under the veil of 'compromise'
the Haripura resolution re-affirmed the attitude of the
right-wing leadership towards the struggles of the people in
the _Princely States_.

It was but natural that there was a powerful section
among the delegates to the Haripura session which was
opposed to this resolution. Whereas the _Kisan Sabha_-Congress
relation was an issue on which the left and right
confronted each other, on the question of the _Princely States_
a section of the right-wing leadership together with the left
raised a challenge to the approach of Gandhi and his
associates. However, the resolution which was introduced by
the right-wing leadership was adopted with a majority of
votes.

In the months that followed the movements for _responsible
government_ forged ahead in many states. In Mysore,
Cochin, Travancore, Kashmir and in the states in Orissa,
Gujarat and other regions the slogan of _responsible government_
reverberated and the struggle for it assumed different
forms. For the first time since the formation of the Congress
various _Princely States_ became the scene of fight against
autocratic rule and for _responsible government_.

Two distinct approaches emerged within and outside the
Congress on how to handle the new situation.

As in the case with the struggle against the British, the
right-wing leadership adopted the policy of mobilizing the
people and utilizing the force thus gained to bargain with
the autocratic rulers in the states. As distinct form this,
the leftists started working with the perspective of leading
the people of the states along the path of revolutionary
struggles against autocratic rule. Depending on the correlation
of forces of the right and the left, particular path was
adopted in each state.

The State of Travancore was a brilliant example of the
revolutionary path. There an organized working class movement
and left parties based on it were growing for more than
a decade. These left movements had close links with similar
movements in the neighbouring state of Cochin and the
Malabar region of British India. Further, there was a state
_Praja_ movement led by _rightists_ but in which leftists actively
participated. Following the Haripura session of the Congress,
a _bourgeois_ democratic movement called the _State Congress_
came to exist there. Demands were raised for the establishment
of a fully _responsible government_ in the state. The
organized working class in the state actively participated in
the struggles waged to realize this demand. The agitation
organized by the State Congress in 1938 for _responsible
government_ and the political strike launched by the working
class as an independent class as part of this agitation were
important events in the political history of Travancore. The
agitation for _responsible government_ transformed itself into
a democratic struggle in which the working class led by the
left parties played a significant role.

The struggle conducted in the state of Rajkot in Gujarat
under the direct leadership of Sardar Patel with the blessings
of Gandhi was quite distinct from this. Neither an organized
working class nor leftist forces were there in that state and
consequently the movement was completely in the hands of
the _rightists_. The ruler of the state and Sardar Patel struck
a compromise which was thrown to the wind by ruler before
the ink was dry on the document forcing Gandhi to launch a
fast in protest against this.

The situation in Kashmir was different from both these
cases. Although bereft of any working class or left movement,
there was a _bourgeois_ leadership which had imbibed, to
an extent, the left ideology, which later became well-known
as the _National Conference_. Although leaders of the _National
Conference_ shared the thinking of the poor and middle
classes in the towns and countryside, they were not able
to organize the people on a revolutionary basis with a working
class outlook. All the weaknesses emanating from this
could be found reflected in the activities of the _National
Conference_ and its leaders like Sheikh Abdulla. But they
did not try to bargain with the ruler in the state and gain
their political objective as did the Gandhian leadership in
Rajkot. They adopted the path of organizing massive
struggles of the people which also found reflected in the later
day politics in the state.

Struggles for _responsible government_ broke out in many
more states. But the Congress was incapable of giving a
centralized leadership to these struggles. The resolution
adopted at the Haripura session to the effect that the Congress
was an 'outside' organization to the _Princely States_ and
that Congress committees should not interfere with the
internal affairs of the states cast its shadow over the democratic
movements in the states.

Despite this, a section of the right-wing leadership of
the Congress was forced by circumstances to remain on the
forefront of the _Praja_ movements. What forced them to take
this stand was the realization on the part of the Indian
_bourgeoisie_ that it was essential to end the autocratic rule
in the _Princely States_ to defeat the game of the British rulers
and also the desire of the _bourgeoisie_ in each state to share
power in their respective state.

## MINISTRIES AND THE RIVALS

The right-wing _bourgeois_ leadership of the Congress
used the ministries in such a way as to make use of the
growing _anti-imperialist_ trend to serve its own class interests.
The ministries tried to implement the main slogans of the
_anti-imperialist_ front, _viz._, _release of political prisoners_, _withdrawal
of the repressive laws_, and _legislation against the
interests of big landlords_. In the process they often came in
conflict with the Governors. In addition, they also initiated
steps towards introducing educational reforms, transformation
of Indian economy through industrialization and
prohibition of intoxicating drinks. The formulation of an
educational system linking education with manual labour and
the formation of the _National Planning Committee_ to introduce
economic planing in post-independence India deserve
special mention. These were the initial efforts made to tell
the people the shape of things to come in the administration as
well as in the economic and educational fields in independent
India.

However, the Congress did not have an undisputed all-India
representation as claimed by it; it was a minority in
five out of eleven provinces. Of these five provinces, only in
Assam and the NWF Province could it form ministries with
the support of certain other political groups and individuals.
In Sind, the Allah Baksh ministry which was formed after
the fall of the ministry headed by Gulam Hussain Hidayatullah
had the indirect support of the Congress. Therefore,
it introduced certain items of the Congress programme. The
governments of the remaining two provinces of Punjab and
Bengal were hostile to the Congress.

These two _non-Congress_ ministries did not command a
majority in the legislatures. The _Unionist Party_ of Sikandar
Hyat Khan in Punjab and the _Krishak Praja Party_ of Fazlul
Huq in Bengal were in power in these two provinces with the
support of certain other parties. Since both of them were
Muslim majority provinces, Jinnah made an attempt to bring
the governments and the ruling parties under the influence
of the _Muslim League_. But none of them yielded to Jinnah.
Fazlul Huq even tried to get the support of the Congress.
Although the _Bengal Pradesh Congress_ was in favour of it,
it had to reject it because the national leadership of the
Congress was opposed to it. In spite of the fact that the
Congress moved to the Opposition, Huq did not go to the
_League_. Similarly, the Hyat Khan ministry remained independent
of both the Congress and the _League_.

The situation in India as a whole was changing rapidly.
As we have indicated earlier, efforts made to form a _CongressLeague_
ministry in UP failed. The rejection of Huq's
request for support by the Congress created serious repercussions
in the _League_ leadership. Huq's appeal to Jinnah to
come to terms with the Congress was turned down. Jinnah
said that be too desired a settlement with Congress, but that
it became impossible because the Congress was trying to
compel the British to accept its demand and leave the
Muslims in the lurch.[^21/11]

[^21/11]: R Coupland, quoted in RC Majumdar (ed), _History and Culture of
the Indian People_, Vol 11, Bombay, _Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan_, 1959, p. 579.

The political developments in India during and after the
elections of 1937 prepared the ground for the rise of the
_Muslim League_ which was one of the several parties of the
Muslims, as the sole representative of the Muslim community.
Following the refusal of the Congress to give a share to the
Muslims in the UP ministry and to cooperate with the Huq
ministry in Bengal, the _Muslim League_ led by Jinnah started
a powerful campaign against the 'anti-Muslim attitude of the
Congress'. The report of the Committee headed by the _Nawab_
of Pirpur, appointed by the _League_ to enquire into the "_anti-Muslim_
measures taken by the Congress government in
UP" provided considerable motivation to the Muslims to
rally behind the _Muslim League_. The '_Pirpur Report_' was
hotly discussed by the Muslims all over India.

This was only the beginning. The alleged 'anti-Muslim
policy' being followed by the Congress governments in other
provinces created commotions among the Muslim masses.
Propaganda was extensively conducted that if the national
democratic set up as demanded by the Congress came to
exist, the Muslims would be physically eliminated and that
if that situation had to be avoided, the Muslims must set
aside the differences among themselves and strengthen the
_League_. The intention of those who let loose this propaganda
was to raise the _League_ to the position of a party of the
Muslims as opposed to the "Hindu political party" --- the
Congress.

With this anti-Congress propaganda of the _League_,
communal clashes between Hindus and Muslims and between
the Sikhs and Muslims began to erupt. These communal
clashes became the worst in 1940--1941 by which the Congress
had left the provincial governments. The _Muslim League_
had adopted a resolution in its Lahore session in March 1940 demanding an independent state of Pakistan by combining
the Muslim majority provinces in India.

Another event which took place in the same period which
needs particular mention was the anti-Hindi agitation in the
Madras province where a Congress ministry was in office.
The people were agitated over the decision of the ministry
to teach compulsorily in the schools Hindi which the Congress
considered as the "symbol of Indian nationalism". The
_Justice Party_ which was defeated in the 1937 elections tried
to fan the anti-Hindi sentiments of the people and turn it
against the Congress. The message of anti-Hindi agitation
reached the people who were already agitated over _Prohibition_
and the newly introduced sales tax to make good the deficit
caused by it. This was the beginning of the anti-North India
slogan raised by the _Dravidar Kazhagam_ and the _Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam_
later on.

The emergence of the _Muslim League_ as an all-India
force and the beginning of Anti-Hindi agitation in Madras
were pointers to the growth of certain new forces in Indian
politics. Along with these, an anti-Congress wave was rising
among the Sikhs, Christians, the depressed castes and others.
Each of these sections was raising challenge in its own way
to the claim made by the Congress that it was the sole representative
of Indian people.

None of these parties and groups was against the declared
objective of the Congress, _viz._, national independence
and a democratic set-up in India. What turned sections of
the people belonging to various religions and castes against the
right-wing leadership of the Congress was the rights they
were to enjoy in an independent democratic India. Therefore,
it would be absurd to characterize any of them as 'lackeys of
the British rulers' and 'enemies of national independence'.
That the British rulers succeeded in turning them individually
and collectively against the Congress and in their own favour
was beside the point. The division of the country into
India and Pakistan in 1947 and the accompanying communal
riots were the culmination of the British moves.

The origin of this was in the years 1937--1939. As
power was transferred to the _bourgeoisie_, though it was
confined to the provinces, dispute arose among the _bourgeoisie_
belonging to the different nationalities on the question
of sharing the power thus transferred. It was this dispute
and the communal riots that arose out of it that finally led
to the slogan of Pakistan and the _direct action_ based on it.

There is another side of the picture. Here we are
referring to the left political forces which had been supporting
the objectives declared by the Congress and challenging
its right-wing leadership while engaged themselves in practical
activities for the realization of these objectives. We have already
described the advance made by the left forces including
the Communists and Socialists, its impact in the country, and
the important position gained by the left outlook in the
election manifesto and other official documents of the Congress.
What follows are some instances which showed the
natural results of these trends.

As we have mentioned earlier, the _Communist Party of
India_ which was reorganized in 1933--1934 was declared
illegal in this period. A change in this situation came about
when the Congress ministries came to power in the provinces.
Since the Party was declared illegal by the Central government,
the Congress governments in the provinces had no
authority to lift the ban on it. However, they were able to
release political prisoners including Communists and Communist
sympathizers and to provide them facilities to conduct
meetings and publish newspapers and journals. This enabled
known Communists to work openly in the trade unions, _Kisan
Sabhas_ and other mass organizations and also to join the
Congress and contest elections. These facilities were offered
by the Congress governments in the provinces.

Using these facilities, the Communists began the publication
of the _National Front_, a weekly from Bombay and the
_New Age_, a monthly from Madras. The _National Front_ was
run by an editorial board consisting of the General
Secretary and members of the Politburo of the Party,
The office of the journal became the legal office of the illegal
Party. Prominent Communist leaders could participate
in the _AICC_ meetings as delegates and as press correspondents.
Thus,the ban on the Party remained only on paper.

Leaders of the _Congress Socialist Party_ which was not
banned, openly conducted their political activities. They
published their journal _The Congress Socialist_ from Bombay.
On the basis of an understanding reached between these two
parties they cooperated with each other in working in the
Congress, _AITUC_, _Kisan Sabha_, Students Federation and
other organizations.

It was true that differences also arose between them in the
process of these activities, and it was also true that these
differences led to a split between them later on. But they were
working together even at that stage on the basis of left unity.

Before and immediately after the election, the right-wing
Congress leadership did not prevent the growth of these left
forces in any way; they even helped them. But the situation
had begun to change after the elections. We have referred
earlier to the attack launched by the right-wing leadership
against the activities of the leftists in the _Kisan Sabha_. However,
the leadership at that time was not prepared to take
things to an open split in the Congress nor to take disciplinary
actions against the leftists. On the contrary, they kept the
leftists Nehru and Bose at the presidentship of the Congress
continuously for three years. Things were moving, however,
to a situation in which an open conflict between the left and
right-wings appeared inevitable. And the conflict did burst
out at the Tripuri session of the Congress.

The developments that took place before and after the
Tripuri session will be dealt with in the following chapter.
It is necessary to point out here that parties of the ruling
classes like the _Muslims League_ on the one side and the left
forces under the leadership of the Communists and Socialists
on the other, had started challenging the right-wing leadership
of the Congress. The dispute between the former and the
right-wing leadership of the Congress was over sharing the
power in the future administrative set up and not over the
form of the set-up and the method to shaping it. The latter,
on the other, opposed the right-wing leadership on the question
of the method to be adopted to achieve independence as
well as the social content of it.
