# Epigraph

England has to fulfil a double mission in India:
One destructive, the other regenerating --- the annihilation
of old Asiatic Society, and the laying of
the material foundations of Western society in
Asia. ... All the English _bourgeoisie_ may be forced
to do will neither emancipate nor materially mend
the social condition of the mass of the people,
depending not only on the development of the
productive powers, but of their appropriation by the
people. But what they will not fail is to lay down
the material premises for both. Has the _bourgeoisie_
ever done more?
