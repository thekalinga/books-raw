#  INTRODUCTION

Our historians once held the view that the Indian history
began with the advent of the Aryans. However, historians
from southern India argues that the Dravidian people have
had a more ancient and developed civilization than the Aryans.
Thus emerged the two streams of Indian history --- one
biased towards the Aryans and the other towards the Dravidians.
Both the streams are largely based on mythologies.
Instead of writing history based on myths, the present author
attempted some time back to examine what instruments of
production were existing at each historical epoch, what were
the social relationships that governed production with such
instruments, and how the changes in social relations led to
political clashes, wars and revolutions.[^02/1]

Many scholars and historians have emerged now, who
have examined history connecting it with the development of
instruments of production, although all of them cannot be
said to have fully assimilated the method of _Historical Materialism_.
These scholars have nonetheless subjected the
views and ideas of early historians to strong and effective
criticism. For example, the very title of the Sardar Patel
Memorial Lectures delivered by Professor Romila Thapar in 1972 was "Past and Prejudice", There she has pointed
out that there were two sections amongst the historians,
one that tried to justify and uphold imperialist domination
of India, and another sympathetic to _anti-imperialist_ struggles.
Historians of both these persuasions tried to examine
history with a prejudice and to formulate "historical theories"
that went well with their respective political biases.

This holds good for the writing of modern Indian
history as well. For example, the pro-imperialist historians
described the situation prevailing in India during the centuries
immediately preceding the advent of foreigners in such
a way as to strengthen the claim of the imperialists that the
traders from Portugal, Holland, France and England made
'uncivilized' India 'civilized'. Nationalist historians, on the
other hand, selected and interpreted historical facts in such
a way as to establish that it was the foreign domination alone
which stood in the way of India's modernization and progress
but for it, India would have achieved progress comparable
to any civilized country in the world.

I have tried to show elsewhere that anyone who examines
Indian history objectively would reject both these views
which are subjective and suited to serve the narrow interests
of the classes which their protagonists represent.[^02/2] In particular,
I have attempted to show that it was the weaknesses
inherent in the Indian social system evolved through centuries
which prepared the ground for foreign domination to
take deep roots in the country. Although it destroyed the
foundation of Indian society in its ancient and medieval
forms, it failed to modernize it on a new basis. It was the process
of modernization that began with the _freedom struggle_.

[^02/2]: _Ibid_.

This is an approach which is different from that of most
other authors on Indian _freedom struggle_. For example, the
pro-imperialist historians treated with contempt the _anti-British_
uprisings that took place earlier in the South in different
forms. The nationalist historians, on the other hand, considered
them as the beginning of and models for the struggle
for national independence. I evaluate these events yet
differently. In fact, people's resistance to the British rule
is as old as the British rule itself. Like the _anti-British_ revolts
under the leadership of Velu Thampi Dalava and Pazhassi
Raja in Kerala, the people in different parts of India had
revolted even before the British rule had got established in
the country. The 1857 uprisings were the most widespread
and the highest form of such local revolts. That widespread
_anti-British_ revolt which the British historians designated as
"_Sepoy Mutiny_" marked the end of a stage in the history of
the national movement. It was a higher form of revolts
jointly conducted by the peasant masses and the feudal gentry
who exploited them, in order to preserve the _varna_-_jati_ relations
and the village system based on these relations which
prevailed in the country before the establishment of the
British rule. At the same time, it was the final stage of a
national struggle of a particular type. Finally, the events
that followed the 1857 struggle showed that such struggles
would never be successful.

Twenty-six years after the suppression of the 1857 revolt,
another organized movement emerged against the foreign
domination. This was the _Indian National Congress_. As
distinct from the people who participated in the 1857 and
earlier _anti-British_ revolts, the people who formed the new
organization were those who perceived the 'progressive' character
of the British rule and foreign culture and wanted to
copy it in India. They were, however, distressed to notice
that the British rulers who introduced progressive changes in
their own country were standing against those changes being
introduced in India. This grievance became more wide-spread
and grew in intensity and finally turned into an _anti-British_
mass struggle. August 15, 1947, was the successful culmination
of this struggle. Therefore, _pro-Congress_ historians
claim that the growth and final victory of the _Indian National
Congress_ represented the continuation and successful culmination
of the mass revolts that took place in different parts
of India in 1857 and earlier.

Several books, monograph and research articles were
brought out in the early 1970's marking the Silver Jubilee of
Independence, in which studies on _anti-British_ revolts found
a prominent place. These researches have surely enriched our
historiography. Most scholars, however, failed to provide
logical answers to a number of important questions such as:

1. Why were the revolts that took place in 1857 and earlier
not successful ? Why did they get suppressed?
2. Why did the national independence movement that emerged
after the suppression of the 1857 revolt keep itself
away from armed struggle of the masses ? Why was it
that the central slogan of that movement came to be
'_non-violent_ struggle' even when it had reached the common
masses? Why did leaders of that movement
avoid the 'danger' of an armed mass struggle by coming
to terms with the foreign rulers ?
3. How was it that sectarian politics based on religious and
caste ideologies put obstacles before the nationalists
from the very inception of the freedom movement and
that the foreign rulers, taking advantage of this kind
of politics, were able to foster disruption within the
movement? How did India, a single political entity
throughout the _freedom struggle_, come to be divided
into two (Indian Union and Pakistan) which came into
clash with each other continually after independence ?
4. Why was it that August 15, 1947, which the entire people
of the country rejoiced at as the birth of a new era,
failed to enthuse _Mahatma Gandhi_ who had stood at the
head of the _freedom struggle_ for a generation ? Why
was it that when a section of his followers turned themselves
into new rulers, another section got disappointed
by the contradiction between their words and deeds? Why
was it that a large section among the Gandhians began
to organize the people one way or another against the
new rulers in the subsequent years?

In brief, the early national movement which culminated
in the 1857 revolt was violently suppressed by the
foreign rulers. The new national independence movement
which emerged around 1885, although it ended apparently
victorious, raised several new problems instead of fulfilling
the aims and objectives it had placed before the people. The
reason is not far to seek.

It was in the second half of the 18th century that the
British became rulers in some parts of India. It took nearly
a century for them to bring the whole of India under their
rule. And within another century, on August 15, 1947, they
had to wind up their regime and leave the country.

The Indian people fought bitter battles against the foreign
domination throughout this period. Thousands laid down their
lives in order to make these battles, in which millions participated,
victorious. Numerous families became destitute and
people faced brutal repressions. It was, in fact, the determination,
courage and the organizational skill demonstrated by
the people in these battles that forced the British to leave
the country.

But independence came not in the manner in which the
courageous patriots who participated in this long-drawn-out
struggle wanted it. The content of the pledge which the people
in thousands of villages and towns were taking on 26th January
every year since 1930 did not materialize. Foreign domination
over the social, political and cultural fronts was not overthrown;
change took place only in the political administration
of the country; White masters were replaced by Brown masters.

In the first stage of the fight for national independence
feudal princes headed the struggle, while in the second stage,
the _bourgeoisie_ was in the leadership. Further, this _bourgeoisie_
did not eliminate the pre-capitalist social system; instead, it
came to a compromise with it. Therefore, it is necessary to
reconsider both stages of the struggle for independence --- one
that ended with 1857 and the other that ended in 1947. The
weaknesses inherent in both the stages must be examined
objectively and evaluated. Being a modest attempt in this
direction, in the present work, my perspective is one of _Historical
Materialism_. Consequently, one may find in it an approach
quite different from that of the ordinary nationalist historian.

This may naturally raise some doubts in the minds of
non-Marxist historians. First, it may be asked: Does not a
commitment to _Historical Materialism_ amount to putting a
fetter on independent historical investigation? Second, whatever
be the situation with regard to other countries, is _Historical
Materialism_ relevant to India? In order to answer these
questions it is necessary to examine the essence of _Historical
Materialism_ and its methods of investigation.

We may begin with the _Manifesto of the Communist Party_
(_Communist Manifesto_ for brief), the most concise and comprehensive
of all the works written from the perspective of
_Historical Materialism_. Engels summarizes the content of
this work as follows.

> ... economic production and the structure of society of
every historical epoch necessarily arising therefrom constitute
the foundation for the political and intellectual history
of that epoch; ... consequently (ever since the dissolution
of the primeval communal ownership of land) all
history has been a history of _class struggles_, of struggles
between exploited and exploiting, between dominated and
dominating classes at various stages of social development; ... this
struggle, however, has now reached a stage
where the exploited and oppressed class (the _proletariat_)
can no longer emancipate itself from the class which
exploits and oppresses it (the _bourgeoisie_), without at the
same time forever freeing the whole of society from
exploitation, oppression and _class struggles_. ...(Preface:1883).

Later there arose some misconceptions among Marxists
on certain points relating to the essence of _Historical
Materialism_ as summarized above. In a correspondence,
Engels himself clarified the position on one of these points.
He stated:

>Marx and I are ourselves partly to blame for the fact
that the younger people sometimes lay more stress on the
economic side than is due to it. _We had to emphasise the
main principle, _vis-à-vis_ our adversaries, who denied it, and we
had not always the time, the place or the opportunity to give their
due to other factors involved in the interaction._[^02/3]

In this same self-critical letter Engels clearly brings out
the interaction between the economic and non-economic
factors.

> ...The economic situation is the basis, but the various
elements of the superstructure --- political forms of the _class
struggle_ and its results, such as constitutions established by
the victorious class after a successful battle, etc., juridical
forms, and especially the reflections of all these real struggles
in the brains of the participants, political, legal, philosophical
theories, religious views and their further development
into systems of dogmas --- also exercise their influence upon
the course of the historical struggles and in many cases
determine their from in particular. _There is an interaction of
all these elements in which, amid all the endless host of accidents
(that is, of things and events whose inner interconnection is
remote or so impossible of proof that we can regard it as non-existent
and neglect it), the economic movement is finally bound
to assert itself._ Otherwise the application of the theory to
any period of history would be easier than the solution
of a simple equation of the first degree.[^02/4]

This conception can be found in all the comprehensive
works of Marx and Engels and even in their brief correspondences.
Marx and Engles did not, nor did the Marxists,
ever consider Marxism to contain the ultimate and permanent
truth, unlike the faith of the believers in the _Vedas_ and
_Upanishads_. The Marxists, who strive not only to "interpret
the world in various ways" but also to "change it", examine
objectively the changes that are continuously taking place
around them, with the aid of the view briefly stated above.
This is the method of Marxism (_Historical Materialism_) for
historical investigations.

[^02/3]: Engels to Joseph Bloch. September 21 (22), 1890. Emphasis added.

[^02/4]: _Ibid_.

When the _Communist Manifesto_ was being written, Europe
was witnessing a violent revolutionary upsurge. Marx and
Engles who actively participated in this upsurge, analyzed
the various theoretical aspects of this revolution. The Introduction
written by Engels to the re-publication of Marx's
_The Class Struggle in France, 1848 to 1850_ analyzing the revolution
of 1848--49 and its lessons, throws light on certain
questions relating to the application of _Historical Materialism_:

>The work here re-published was Marx's first attempt to
explain a section of contemporary history by means of his
materialist conception, as the basis of the given economic
situation ... If events and series of events are judged by
current history, it will never be possible to go back to the
_ultimate_ economic causes. Even today ... it still remains
impossible ... to follow day by day the movement of industry
and trade in the world market and the changes which
take place in the methods of production in such way as
to be able to draw a general conclusion, for any point of
time, from these manifold, complicated and ever-changing
factors, the most important of which ... generally operate a
long time in secret before they ... (are) violently felt on the
surface.

In the Introduction, Engels also points to certain errors
made by Marx while undertaking to evaluate the _class struggles_
in France between 1848--50:

>When Marx undertook his work, the source of error
mentioned was even more unavoidable. It was simply impossible
during the period of the Revolution of 1848--49 to
follow up the economic transformation taking place at the
same time or even to keep them in view. It was the same
during the first months of, exile in London, in the autumn and
Winter of 1848--50. But that was just the time when Marx
began this work. And in spite of these unfavourable circumstances,
his exact knowledge both of the economic situation in
France before, and of the political history of that country
after the February Revolution made it possible for him to
give a picture of events which laid bare their inner connections
in a way never attained ever since, and which later
brilliantly stood the double test applied by Marx himself.

Stating that Marx wrote these in the midst of the revolutionary
upsurge in 1848--50 and that some changes were
introduced in the formulation as a result of the studies conducted
later by Marx himself, Engels continues:

>... we declared as early as autumn 1850 that atleast the
_first_ chapter of the revolutionary period was closed and
that nothing was to be expected until the outbreak of a
new world economic crisis. For which reason we were
excommunicated, as traitors to the revolution, by the very
people who later, almost without exception, made their
peace with Bismark --- as far as Bismark found their worth
the trouble. But history has shown us too to have been wrong,
has revealed our point of view of that time to have been
an illusion. It has done even more: it has not merely dispelled
the erroneous notions we then held; it has also
completely transformed the conditions under which the
_proletariat_ has to fight. The mode of struggle of 1848 is
today obsolete in every respect. ...

Marx and Bagels, however, did not confine themselves
to this self-criticism, with respect to the experience of
revolutionary struggles. They also reviewed carefully the
contents of each of their works written before, during and
after writing the _Communist Manifesto_. In this process they
did not hesitate to draw new conclusions whenever they
found new facts which convinced them of the need to revise
the conclusions they had earlier arrived at. They took particular
care to gather all the historical facts and statistics in
respect of all countries, including Russia, China and India.
They began to learn many languages for this purpose.

It is clear that Marx and Engels never regarded
themselves as sages who had realized the ultimate truth, but
as scientific investigators devoted to finding truth. It is in this
sense that Marxist students of history, including the present
author, accept the approach of _Historical Materialism_.

Anyone who is engaged in the study of and research in
history with the perspective of _Historical Materialism_ should
not neglect the historical facts brought out by other investigators
who do not adopt this perspective. Rather, each such
historical fact should be carefully examined. Similarly, the
conclusions they reach on the basis of these facts should be
critically examined. For example, several studies have come
out in the recent times in Indian history in general and in
the history of _freedom struggle_ in particular. Each of these
studies contains a good deal of valuable facts.

However, many of these studies are made with the perspective
of _bourgeois_ nationalism. Some others are, on the
other hand, written from the point of view of a religion or
from the narrow outlook of the people of a region or the
speakers of a language. Such biases can be discerned not
only in arriving at conclusions but also in selecting the
materials for study. They should not be blindly accepted.
At the same time, as scholarly investigators, they have
brought out historical facts. These facts must be used to
enrich the method of _Historical Materialism_.

The questions raised earlier make obvious the need to
enrich the method of _Historical Materialism_ by subjecting
the studies and investigations of non-Marxist historians to
critical examination. These questions are such that none of the
histories of _freedom struggle_ is capable of providing logical
answers to them. On the other hand, if one utilizes _Historical
Materialism_ to examine the entire _freedom struggle_ based on
the study of the development of India's past, the nature of
social system prevalent in India immediately before the establishment
of foreign rule in the country and the changes
introduced by the foreign rulers in this system, one can
provide answers which the nationalist historians are unable to
provide. This is what is being attempted in the present work.
