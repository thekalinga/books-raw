# TOWARDS _FULL INDEPENDENCE_

## THE DIVIDE AND RULE TACTICS

Whenever there was a mass upsurge, the British used to
resort to the divide and rule tactics to beat it back. As
we have seen earlier, they rallied the moderates against the
extremists and turned the Muslim big-wigs against the Congress
in 1905-06, and in 1919-21 used the moderates and
several communal and casteist organizations against the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_
movement. The same tactics were used
against the new mass upsurge which was started in 1928-29.

The first and foremost success they achieved was in the
field of trade union movement. As we know, workers'
organizations emerged in India linked with the freedom movement
in the wake of the extremist politics. We also know
that the attempts made by the British to stop this trend and
to make it an appendage of British imperialism and its agent,
the _Amsterdam International_, had failed. In 1928-29, they
adopted new tactics to make up this failure and to achieve
their objective. And they were successful in that attempt.

Along with the _Simon Commission_ which was appointed
to go into the question of constitutional reforms, certain other
commissions and committees had also been appointed by
the Government to draw the attention of the elite sections of
the Indian society to its side.

It had become necessary for the British _monopoly
capitalism_ to bring about a capitalist transformation in agriculture
in India. Changes in the agrarian structure too had
become necessary lo rally the landlord classes behind them.
For this purpose, an agricultural commission was appointed
with Lord Linlithgow as chairman. Similarly, a committee
with Sir Philip Hartog as chairman to prepare a report on
educational reforms to suit capitalist development and a
labour commission with Whitley as chairman were also appointed.
Whitley had the distinction of having drawn up a
number of planned schemes of industrial relations in Britain
which skillfully transformed the British trade union movement
into an appendage of British imperialism.

Since all these commissions and committees were intended
to protect the British imperialist rule, the militant sections
both inside and outside the Congress were against extending
cooperation to them. We have referred to earlier the
successful _boycott_ of the _Simon Commission_, the most important
of the these commissions, thanks to the unity of the left
and right forces inside and outside the Congress. A similar
approach was adopted by the leftists including the _Congressmen_
with regard to the _Whitely Commission_.

Although the left _Congressmen_ and Communists had
considerable influence in the _All-India Trade Union Congress_
(_AITUC_), the moderates were not an insignificant minority
in it. True, the _AITUC_ was far ahead of the Congress in
raising the immediate demands of the workers and in adopting
the objective of socialism. It may be noted that it
had adopted the objective of socialism in 1928, some three
decades before the Congress adopted, formally though,
"socialistic pattern" as its objective.

However, the _AITUC_ was lagging behind the Congress
on matters relating to the general political issues of _anti-imperialism_.
For instance, on account of the opposition of
the moderate leadership, _AITUC_ could not adopt a resolution
to affiliate to the _League against Imperialism_ whereas, the
Congress had affiliated itself to the _League_ and sent delegates
to its world conference.

This becomes further clear from the approach adopted
by the Congress towards the _Simon Commission_ and the
attitude of the moderates in the _AITUC_ towards the
Whiteley Commission. Both the left and right sections in
the Congress were united in the _boycott_ of the _Simon Commission_.
But there was no such a unity between the right and
left sections in the _AITUC_ in the _boycott_ of the _Whitely
Commission_. Further, the _AITUC_ split on this issue, the
first split in the Indian trade union movement.
Although a large number of top Congress leaders including
Tilak, Lajpat Rai and C. R. Das, had played a significant
role in the growth of the trade union movement.

there was a section of leaders under the political influence
of Gokhale and other moderates in the _AITUC_. Just as the
world Communist movement had influenced the leftists in
the _AITUC_, so the _Amsterdam International_ had influenced
the rightist trade union leaders. Thus, the leftist section
including the Congress who cooperated with the Communists
and other leftists and the rightists section under the influence
of the _Amsterdam International_ came to a clash with
each other.

The central point of dispute between these two groups
was the approach towards the Whiteley Commission. The
ruling circles who saw the depth and the extent of the people's
protest against the _Simon Commission_ were shrewd
enough to take the necessary precaution to see that the
commission on labour had Indian representatives.

Thus, the Whitley Commission had two representatives
of Indian workers on it. The moderate labour leaders,
N, M. Joshi and Dewan Chamanlal unilaterally agreed to
serve in the commission without consulting either the _AITUC_
or the different political groups in it. In fact, it was only
after they had accepted the membership that the very issue of
approach to the Commission came up before the _AITUC_.
Naturally, it aroused deep resentment among the delegates
to the Nagpur session of the _AITUC_ in 1929.

It was in the atmosphere of this resentment that the
decision to _boycott_ the Whitley Commission was adopted.
Simultaneously, two resolutions were passed, one demanding
the release of the accused in the _Meerut Conspiracy Case_
the other for affiliating the _AITUC_ with the _League_ against
Imperialism. Protesting against these resolutions adopted
by the majority, the moderate leadership walked out of the
conference and formed a rival trade union organization
based on moderatist outlook.

The British rulers realized that the success they had achieved
in splitting the trade union movement could not be
repeated easily in the political field. All shades of opinion from
the moderates outside the Congress to the leftists inside the
Congress and the different revolutionary groups outside, had
raised in one voice the demand of "at least a _Dominion
Status_". An ultimatum had already been served by the Congress
to the effect that if this demand was not conceded before 31st December 1929, _direct action_, including non-payment of
tax, would be launched. In the circumstances, the British
were forced to evolve a new tactic to engineer a split in the
political front.

Meanwhile, a political change favourable to this had
come about in Britain itself. In May 1929 the Labour Party
come to power defeating the ruling Conservatives. Although
the Commissions referred to above were appointed by the Conservative
Government, the Labour Party had played its own
role in all actions intended to tighten the British monopolist grip
on India. Therefore, it was clear that there would not be any
change in the government policy despite the Labour Party
being in power. But the Labour Party leaders had to pretend
that theirs was a government trying to protect the interests of
the British workers and the Indian democratic movement to
the extent possible. So, the Labour Party government came up
to take certain seemingly conciliatory steps without effecting
any fundamental change in the structure or terms of reference
of the _Simon Commission_. Thus, the Labour Prime Minister,
Ramsay MacDonald, called the Viceroy to England for
consultations. Further, it was proposed to hold a conference
in London with leaders of the different political parties and
sections to ascertain the Indian public opinion before enacting
an appropriate bill in accordance with the report of the
_Simon Commission_.

The Government accepted this proposal and the Viceroy
Lord Irwin accordingly issued a statement on 31st October.
In the statement, the Viceroy declared that the perspective
before the government in all considerations with regard to
constitutional reform, in general, was _Dominion Status_. It
marked the beginning of a calculated move to create disunity
between the Congress and the moderates, between thc leftists
and the rightists in the Congress, among the different organizations
which dealt with communal-caste politics, including
the _Muslim League_ and between these sections,on the one hand
and the Congress, on the other. As we shall see later, these
proposed (Round Table) conferences turned out to be a
platform to stretch out these disputes and quarrels endlessly.

However, these tactics of the government failed for the
time being. An all-India leadership conference was held
in Delhi within 24 hours after Irwin issued the statement.
The Conference in which Congress leaders like Gandhi and
Motilal Nehru and the liberals like Sapru and the President
of the Central Assembly Vithalbhai Patel participated, decided
to accept the Viceroy's proposals subject to the following
conditions.

1. The scheme which should form the basis of discussion
   at the Conference should be the implementation of
   _Dominion Status_.
2. A majority of the delegates to the conference should
   be from the Congress.
3. All political prisoners should be released forthwith.
4. The functions of the existing government of India,
   as far as possible in the present context, should be befitting
   a government of _Dominion Status_.

This resolution adopted by Congress and the moderates
outside it was, according to Jawaharlal Nehru, a success as
a decision of a conference in which the leftists and moderates
were participants; but as far as the Congress was concerned it
was a "step backwards".

For the Congress, the four conditions included in the
resolution were not negotiable. If the government were not
willing to accept them, the Congress would be unwilling to
cooperate with it. But, for liberals, this constituted their
maximum demand. Hence, they were willing for a compromise.
This was Nehru's evaluation of the resolution.

Thus, the leadership conference of November 1929 ended
in creating conditions for a break between the Congress and
the liberals. However, it helped to keep the liberals with
the Congress at least for the time being. The resolution
also helped to prevent a rupture between the left and right
wings inside the Congress and to move them together into
a struggle to be launched under Gandhi's leadership.

In accordance with the Calcutta resolution, the leftists
were obliged to wait for a year; meanwhile, if the government
granted _Dominion Status_, then the Congress would
accept it. On the contrary, if the government was unwilling
to grant this demand, the Congress, including Gandhi, was
obliged to launch a struggle.

Gandhi and Motilal Nehru used the leadership conference
as a means to fulfil the obligations of both sides and at
the same time to maintain the unity of the Congress. They
utilized the developments following the leaders' conference to
accede to the demand of the left wing _Congressmen_ to move
along the path of _direct action_ as directed by the Calcutta
session, since the government had refused to concede even
the very moderate demands of a liberal leader like Sapru.

## PREPARATIONS FOR THE NEW STRUGGLE

The general thinking prevalent among the _Congressmen_
after the Calcutta session was that since the granting of
_Dominion Status_ within one year as demanded at the session
was highly improbable, the Congress must make all preparations
to launch a struggle. However, Gandhi had his own
view on the nature of such preparations. The form of struggle
that Gandhi had visualized was one of "complete non-violence",
and of mobilizing the national force of the masses
patiently tolerating all the repressions that might come
form the "other side". And this must be achieved through
the "constructive" programmes he had formulated.

Soon after the Calcutta session, the Congress Working
Committee appointed a number of sub-committees to strengthen
mass contact and also to implement the "constructive"
programme. The sub-committees were intended to take
care of _boycott_ of foreign cloth, prohibition of liquor, removal
of untouchability, Congress organization, volunteer
organization and redressal of women's grievances.

The sub-committees on all these issues (except on the
last which remained on paper only) worked vigorously. Gandhi
himself was the chairman of the committee for the
_boycott_ of foreign cloth. Rajagopalachari was in charge of
prohibition and Jamnalal Bajaj was to lead the activities for
the removal of untouchability. The tours and other activities
of these leaders, though conducted in connection with the
discharge of their specific responsibilities, did help to create
a general awareness among the people about the Congress
session scheduled for the year-end and the developments that
were likely to take place subsequent to it.

The work of the Congress and volunteer organizations
served to create a wide mass base, unprecedented except perhaps
for the 1920-21 period. This showed that the Congress
had begun to grow with a base firmer than what it was in 1920-21.

It was during this period that the _Hindusthan Seva Dal_,
a volunteer organization of Karnataka, became an all-India
organization. The _Seva Dal_ and its camps were utilized to
impart elementary physical training as well as political education
that were essential for the volunteers. Decisions were
taken to enrol a certain percentage of the total population
of the provinces as members of Congress and establish
functionally effective committees in at least a minimum
number of districts with active members of the Congress
contributing a fixed percentage of their income towards the
Congress fund. Work based on these decisions helped transform
the Congress into a well-knit mass organization.

Work in the legislatures had begun to bear the mark of
the impending struggle. In the Central Assembly, President
Vithalbhai Patel gave the ruling that a debate on the Public
Safety Bill in the House would prejudice a fair trial of the
_Meerut Conspiracy Case_ which was going on simultaneously.
The ruling and the speech made by the Viceroy in utter disregard
to the ruling caused a havoc in the Assembly. In Bengal,
following the repeated defeats of the government in the legislature,
the legislature itself was dissolved. The general
impact of these events was so great and the fighting mood
of the people so high that it was decided that the Congress
members in the Central and provincial assemblies needed
to attend the legislatures only to retain their membership, utilizing
the rest of the time for political work.

The Congress moved on these lines at a time when the activities
of the revolutionaries, were going on with increased
vigour. The _Lahore Conspiracy Case_ trial involving Bhagat
Singh and his colleagues was progressing. The fast undertaken
by the accused in the jail and the death of one of them
(Jatin Das) had made the Indian people in general and the
youth in particular indignant. Proceedings of the _Meerut
Conspiracy Case_ involving many prominent Communist, and
_non-Communist_ trade union workers were also going on. A
large number of nationalist activists including many prominent
Congress leaders were imprisoned on various counts.

In this background, there was a widespread feeling
that the "_constructive programme_", organizational work and
partial _boycott_ of the legislature, etc., being carried out by
the Congress leadership were inadequate to meet the situation.
All this turned out to make the soil fertile for bomb-politics.

It was in these backgrounds that the leaders of the
Congress and the moderates entered into negotiations with
the British. This evoked sharp protests from the ranks,
as a reflection of which Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas
Chandra Bose who were regarded as leftist leaders tendered
resignation form the _Congress Working Committee_. The
revolutionaries outside the Congress who were engaged
in bomb-politics intensified their activities. They even tried
to blow up the train in which the Viceroy was travelling,
injuring some of his attendants. It was obvious that the
attack on the viceregal train was intended to prevent the
negotiations between the Viceroy and the Congress leaders
or at least to make them fruitless.

It was in this background again that the question came
up as to who should be the president of the Lahore session.
The general consensus was that at a time when a struggle for
independence was imminent, Gandhi was the only individual
strong enough to be its commander-in-chief. Ten provincial
committees proposed his name. The name of Vallabhbhai
Patel was proposed by five PCCs. Patel's nomination was
obviously in recognition of the leadership that he had given
to the successful Bardoli peasant struggle and of his capability
to lead the forthcoming struggle. Jawaharlal Nehru with
the support of three provinces was placed in the third position
in the list of presidential candidates.

Gandhi, however, declined his nomination. Nor did he
approve of the nomination of Patel who was in the second
position, Instead, he expressed his opinion in favour of
Jawaharlal Nehru whose position was third in the list. The
entire Congress leadership including Patel accepted Gandhi's
proposal. Thus, Jawaharlal Nehru who had never concealed
opposition to the policies pursued by the Congress leadership
including Gandhi and Motilal Nehru, was elected president
of the Congress.

This was an incident that invited considerable debate
in the political circles. What was the secret behind Gandhi,
the trusted leader of the majority, giving up the presidentship
of the Congress in favour of Jawaharlal Nehru, the
representative of a minority in the Congress? Why did the
entire Congress leadership decide to transfer the Congress
presidentship from the renowned moderate leader Motilal to
his son Jawaharlal? How far personal sentiments like Gandhi's
interest in Jawaharlal and Motilal's affection to his son influenced
the decision?

We have referred to above certain facts helpful in finding
answers to these questions. No matter how extensive
the popular force the Congress was able to rally behind
itself through "_constructive programmes_" and organizational
work, this alone was not sufficient to conduct a bitter _anti-British_ struggle.
For the leftists inside and outside the Congress
were not less active and militant than the Congress workers
who were engaged in _constructive programmes_ or organized
in _Seva Dals_. Only a leadership capable of mobilizing their
sense of self-sacrifice and cautious activities would be
able to inspire the millions in the struggle. Realizing this fact,
it was necessary to create the impression both among the
people and the Congress workers that the young generation of
leftists was being brought up to the leadership position.

Another factor that promoted Gandhi to propose Jawaharlal
to the presidentship of the Congress was his opinion
about his personality. However strongly he might express
his leftist ideology in his articles and speeches, Jawaharlal
Nehru was in the final analysis a "disciplined" disciple of
Gandhi. True, he was a staunch opponent of the views of
his father and leader; but when faced with practical politics
Jawaharlal transforms himself into a devoted Gandhian --- this
was Gandhi's assessment of Jawaharlal's personality.

For instance, nominating Jawaharlal to the presidentship
Gandhi stated: "And if he has the dash and the rashness of a
warrior, he has also the prudence of a statesman. A lover
of discipline, he has shown himself to be capable of rigidly
submitting to it even where it has seemed irksome. He is
undoubtedly an extremist, thinking far ahead of his surroundings.
But he is humble and practical enough not to force
to pace to the breaking point. He is pure as a crystal, he
is faithful beyond suspicion. He is a knight _sans peur_, _sans
reproche_. The nation is safe in his hands."[^13/1]

Subsequent events have proved the correctness of this
assessment. In his first presidential address and in numerous
speeches, statements and articles that followed, Nehru formulated
his leftist thoughts. Often it brought crises in the
leadership circles of the Congress and on occasions, he had to
give up the leadership position to freely express his dissent.
But on all such occasions he remained a trusted follower of
Gandhi. Whenever formidable challenges were raised against
the Gandhian leadership, its outlook and programmes, Jawaharlal
created the impression among the people that he stood
"between Gandhi and the leftists". In effect, however, he
had been saving the Gandhian leadership from the challenges
it had been facing. In the following pages, we shall see this
repeating again and again. Here we will only point out the
understanding Gandhi and other leaders had on the forthcoming
struggle following the Lahore Congress and the role
played by the election of Jawaharlal Nehru in the struggle.

It would be useful here to make a comparative analysis
of the struggles of 1920-21 and the forthcoming struggle of 1928-29. The basis of the former was the popular reaction
to the deepening economic and political crises in the post-war
years. Gandhi tried to provide an organized form to this
popular reaction for which he was the most skillful and experienced
of all the _bourgeois_ political leaders. He was
successful in accomplishing this by raising such simple slogans
as "_Swaraj_ in one year", collecting the Tilak _Swaraj_ Fund
and propagating the spinning wheel. And the limitations of
this approach were demonstrated themselves through the
_Chauri Chaura_ and other incidents.

[^13/1]: D. G. Tendulkar, _Mahatma_, Vol II, New Delhi, Publications Division, 1969, p. 372.

The situation in 1928-29 was different. There were now
not only the masses who had imbibed the spirit of mass
struggles, but also organized movements borne out of their
struggles as well as the revolutionary ideologies leading
them. There were the trade unions and their strike struggles,
the youth organizations and their forms of struggle, the agitations
and struggles of the peasantry and the revolutionary
organizations imbibing the communist and socialist ideologies
which had tremendously influenced these movements and
struggles. The impact of all these was found on the ranks and
active workers of the Congress as well as on a section of its
leadership. Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose and
other leaders of the younger generation, in fact, emerged as
the representatives of these sections.

It was a necessity for the _bourgeois_ Congress leadership
including Gandhi, to rally under its own banner these new
forces which had not yet emerged in 1920-21. At the same
time, they had to see to it that these revolutionary forces did
not cross the bounds set by the _bourgeois_ leadership on to
dangerous' paths. In other words, they had to "tame" these
revolutionary forces which were likely to constitute themselves
a challenge to the _bourgeois_ leadership. The most
suitable means for it was to install as Congress president a
widely accepted "young leader" like Jawaharlal who was a
devoted disciple of Gandhi and to exercise the control of the
right wing leadership on him.

Although the present decision pertained only to the
question of who should preside over the Lahore session of
the Congress, it marked the beginning of the future
developments. Through this decision Gandhi declared that his
successor in Indian politics would be none of the well known
Gandhians like Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajagopalachari and
Rajendra Prasad, but Jawaharlal Nehru who was known to
be an opponent of himself. The kind of _freedom struggle_
Gandhi visualized would not be complete even with leaders
like the eminent parliamentarian, Motilal Nehru and constructive
workers like Patel and Rajagopalachari. For that
purpose the leftist forces represented by Jawaharlal Nehru
must also be mobilized. Not only that. There must be a
guarantee that the leftist forces thus mobilized did not go
beyond the control of the social forces which he represented.
Gandhi was able to accomplish all this. And he knew that
Jawaharlal Nehru would be of greatest assistance to him in
"taming the leftist forces".

We have referred to earlier the statement of Tilak that
Gandhi represented the new mass upsurge and that he would
not stand in his way. Now the situation was somewhat
different from what was known as the "end of the Tilak era".
In 1928-29, Gandhi could not claim the sole representation
of the mass upsurge; Gandhi's leadership would become useful
and effective only if the new revolutionary forces represented
by Jawaharlal Nehru were mobilized. However, without
Gandhi and his right wing leadership, Jawaharlal would not
become the full representative of the new popular upsurge.
In other words, the _bourgeois_ national leadership would be
complete only if the disciples of Gandhi, the parliamentarians
and the younger generation of the left forces were brought
together. The election of Jawaharlal Nehru was an open
declaration of this fact.

## THE LAHORE SESSION

At the midnight of 31st December 1929, the hour at
which the one-year grace period given at the Calcutta session
of December 1928 ended, the Lahore session of the Congress
passed the resolution affirming _full independence_ as the
national objective. Soon after, the delegates led by President
Jawaharlal Nehru left the _Pandal_ to unfurl the Indian independence
flag.

The resolution was adopted almost unanimously, with
hardly 15 hands raising against in a gathering of thousands
of delegates. It was a rare spectacle of the disciples of
Gandhi, advocates of participation in legislature, leftists
and all other sections rallying behind the objective of _full
independence_ and the imminent struggle to achieve the
objective. A new voice of mass upsurge reverberated throughout
the country.

But behind this demonstration of unity revealed the
intense clash that took place among the various trends of
political thought and groups. On a number of occasions,
divisions were taken for voting and issues decided with a
narrow majority. Even in the case of the main resolution
on _full independence_, its different clauses came under heavy
attack before they were adopted with a narrow margin of
votes.

Though the president of the session was an acknowledged
leftist leader, the leftists moved a number of amendments
to many resolutions and to many clauses of the main
resolution moved officially. The point by point fight they put
up ended in votings. In the final stage of the session, Subhas
Bose and other lefist leaders who could not agree with the
leadership on the composition of the new _Working Committee_,
formed a new organization called the Congress Democratic
Party. Only the civil disobedience movement which was
launched a few weeks after that could save the Congress
from another split.

As we know, Jawaharlal Nehru was installed president
of the Congress as the representative of the younger generation
with leftist ideologies. In fact, his presidential address
was in consonance with the expectations of the delegates as
well as of the people at large. In the address, Jawaharlal
Nehru declared that he was a socialist and republican
fighting against all royal and feudal privileges. It was for
the first time that a Congress President was delivering such
a speech. And it was on this basis that he handled issues
like full independence and opposition to _Dominion Status_.

Based on the experience he had gained through the
participation in the Anti-imperialist _League_ and the visit to
the Soviet Union, he tried to link the _freedom struggle_ with the
world-wide anti-imperialist struggle and to the advance of
socialism. At the same time, he was of the view that
the struggle under the leadership of the Congress must be
valued as high as or even greater than his own views as a
leftist. In the Presidential address, he made clear that he
was endeavouring to get along well with his colleagues including
the Gandhians, on a number of issues such as the
role of non-violence in the struggle. Consequently, he remained
firm with the leadership rather than with his leftist colleagues
like Subhas Bose on questions of the composition of the
_Working Committee_ and the subsequent formation of the
Congress Democratic Party.

The position taken by Nehru as president in no way
influenced the leftist delegates. As mentioned above, they
fought out issue by issue. They even defeated some of the
proposals put forward by Gandhi by joining hands with
other non-Gandhian sections. For example, Gandhi suggested
that the programmes of the _boycott_ of foreign cloth, prohibition
and removal of untouchability should be conducted
under the auspices of organizations independent of the
Congress. (The manufacture and sale of _Khadi_ had already
been entrusted to the Spinners' Association, an organization
independent of the Congress.) This suggestion was rejected.
Similarly, as with the means of struggle, Gandhi suggested
that "peaceful and just" be replaced by "truthful and _non-violent_".
This too was rejected.

However, the sharpest confrontation was between the
leftists on the one hand and the disciples of Gandhi and the
advocates of participation in the legislature on the other. It was
as a sequel to this that the leadership had secured only a
narrow margin of votes. For example, the leadership had
moved a resolution condemning the bomb attack of the train
in which the Viceroy was travelling just a week before the
Lahore Congress. It was passed by a margin of only 48
votes.

Again, the resolution on _full independence_ began with an
appreciation of the statement of the leadership made in response
to the Viceroy's announcement of 31st October and the
efforts made by the Viceroy. This part of the resolution evoked
heated discussions. The left wing contented that the statement
of the leadership was a backpedalling from the objective
of the Congress and the Viceroy's announcement a trap. On
this issue the leadership could carry only a narrow majority
of 180 votes with them.

The main resolution _inter alia_ stated that "nothing is
to be gained in the existing circumstances by the Congress
being represented at the proposed _Round Table Conference_."
The phrase "in the existing circumstances" was subjected to
severe criticism. The left argued that this phrase was a
loophole left by the leadership in the resolution to enable
them to participate in a _round table conference_ in the future
on the pretext of "changed circumstances". Here also the
combined force of Gandhians and the protagonists of parliamentary
activities defeated the left wing with a narrow
margin.

The main resolution finally emerged in the session was
one that inspired a large majority of the delegates and even
the entire country, except a few among the protagonists of
parliamentary activities. The major features of the resolution
are as follows.

1) Although appreciating the Viceroy and leadership
   which issued the statement following his announcement and
   with the phrase "in the existing circumstances", the resolution
   declared that the Congress would not attend the _Round
   Table Conference_ to be called by the British.
2) Since the grace period allowed by the Calcutta
   session had come to an end and also since the moves made
   by the government in conceding the national demand was not
   satisfactory, the session declared that the immediate demand
   of the Congress was _full independence_. As a corollary of
   this, the Motilal _Nehru Report_ envisaging _Dominion Status_
   had become out-dated.
3) As a preliminary step towards organizing a campaign
   for _full independence_, the session called upon complete
   _boycott_ of the legislatures and committees constituted by the
   government and directed _Congressmen_ and others taking
   part in the national movement to abstain from participating
   in the future elections and the present members of the legislatures
   to resign their seats.
4) While appealing the people to zealously carry on the
   _constructive programmes_ of the Congress, the resolution authorized
   the _AICC_ "where it deems fit, to launch upon a
   programme of civil disobedience, including the non-payment
   of taxes, whether in selected areas or otherwise and under
   such safeguards as it may consider necessary".

The Lahore session adopted two other resolutions which
deserve special mention. One of them requested the rulers
of the princely states to establish responsible governments in
the states and guarantee the protection of civil liberties of
the people. This represented a change in the policy of
"non-interference in the internal affairs of the princely states"
which had hitherto been followed by the Gandhian
leadership of the Congress.

The other resolution was more sensational. It was a reiteration
of a resolution passed earlier at the Gaya session
making it clear that the Indian people would not be held responsible
for the unjust public debt imposed by the British
rulers on India. It also warned the prospective creditors of
future debts that free India would be liable to pay back the
debt only if it was convinced that it was just and reasonable.

These resolutions showed that the Congress which was
preparing for a struggle to achieve the immediate objective
of _full independence_ had started taking a different attitude
towards the rulers of the princely states who were the benchmen
of the British and towards those who were giving
the British government financial assistance. In other words,
the _bourgeois_ leadership became convinced of the need for
such a new approach to inspire the people to take part in the
_freedom struggle_ which was going to be launched within a
few weeks.

However, the composition of the new _Working Committee_
formed after the Lahore session was not in accord with the
leftist ideology expressed in the presidential address and in the
resolutions passed in the session. The leftists did not get
representation in the _Working Committee_ in proportion to
their strength among the delegates as displayed by the pattern
of voting on the different resolutions. All members in the
committee, except President Jawaharlal Nehru, were either
the disciples of Gandhi or the advocates of parliamentary
participation. It may be noted that the demand of the leftists
that the election to the _Working Committee_ must be democratic
was rejected by the leadership. Thus, Jawaharlal
Nehru became the head of a leadership which was formed
in a manner which was not in correspondence with the political
thinking current among the delegates and the common
people.

But surpassing all these issues and pushing them to the
background, the problem of the imminent struggle for _full
independence_ came up before the people. The new _Working
Committee_ met soon after the close of the Congress session
and decided to observe 26th January as _Full Independence_
Day throughout the country as the first step towards making
preparation for the struggle. The _Working Committee_ also
prepared a declaration to be read and adopted throughout
the country, as part of the observation of Independence Day.
The text of the declaration which inspired the entire people
and was repeated many a time is as follows.

We believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian
people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to
enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of
life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth.
We believe also that if any government deprives a people
of these rights and oppresses them, the people have a
further right to alter it or to abolish it. The British government
in India has not only deprived the Indian people
of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of
the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically,
culturally and spiritually. We believe, therefore, that India
must sever the British connection and attain _Purna Swaraj_
or Complete Independence.

India has been ruined economically. The revenue derived
from our people is out of all proportion to our income.
Our average income is seven pice, less than two pence,
per day, and of the heavy taxes we pay, twenty percent
are raised from the land revenue derived from the peasantry
and three percent from the salt tax, which falls
most heavily on the poor.

Village industries, such as handspinning, have been destroyed,
leaving the peasantry idle for at least four months in
the year, and dulling their intellect for want of handicrafts,
and nothing has been substituted, as in other countries,
for the crafts thus destroyed.

Customs and currency have been so manipulated as 10
heap further burdens on the peasantry, The British manufactured
goods constitute the bulk of our imports. Customs
duties betray clear partiality for British manufacturers,and
revenue form them is used not to lessen the burden on the
masses, but for sustaining a highly extravagant administration.
Still more arbitrary has been the manipulation of
the exchange ratio which has resulted in millions being
drained away from the country.

Politically, India's status has never been so reduced, as
under the British regime. No reforms have given real
political power to the people. The tallest of us have to
bend before foreign authority. The rights of free expression
of opinion and free association have been denied to
us, and many of our countrymen are compelled to live in
exile abroad, and they cannot return to their homes. All
administrative talent is killed, and the masses have to be
satisfied with petty village offices and clerkships.
Culturally, the system of education has tom us from our
moorings, our training has made us hug the very chains
that bind us.

Spiritually, compulsory disarmament has made us unmanly,
and the presence of an alien army of occupation, employed
with deadly effect to crush in us the spirit of resistance,
has made us think that we cannot look after ourselves or
put up a defence against foreign aggression, or defend
our homes and families from the attacks of thieves, robbers,
and miscreants.

We hold it to be a crime against man and God to submit
any longer to a rule that has caused this four-fold disaster
in our country. We recognise, therefore, that the most effective
way of gaining our freedom is not through violence.
We will prepare ourselves by withdrawing, so far as we can,
all voluntary association from the British Government,
and will prepare for civil disobedience including non-payment
of taxes. We are convinced that if we can but
withdraw our voluntary help, stop payment of taxes without
doing violence, even under provocation, the end of
this inhuman role is assured. We, therefore, hereby
solemnly resolve to carry out the Congress instructions
issued from time to time for the purpose of establishing
_Purna Swaraj_.

This Independence Pledge is a milestone in the history
not only of the _Indian National Congress_ but in the journey
of the entire people of the country.

## THE DANDI MARCH

The Independence Day was first observed on 26th
January 1930 all over the country. There was no province
or district which kept aloof from it. The thousands of public
meetings and the tens of thousands people who took the pledge
of complete independence made the resolution adopted at the
Lahore Congress and the pledge prepared by the _Congress
Working Committee_ the common property of the people of
the country.

The rulers got into a panic about the popular emotion
that swept across the country. They tried to meet it with
_lathi-charges_ and firings. Many, including the renowned
leftist leader, Subhas Bose, were arrested and sentenced to
long terms of imprisonment.

However, the rulers realized that the people's upsurge
for complete independence could not be suppressed by these
actions. Consequently, they initiated certain "conciliatory"
moves. Within 24 hours of the Independence Day observation,
Lord Irwin issued a statement to "remove the doubts"
in the minds of the Indians on the nature of the _Round Table
Conference_. It was a repetition of the statements made
earlier by the Viceroy himself and the British ministers.
However, it was couched in a language of appeasement.

In response to this, Gandhi made a statement which
deserves particular attention. The statement revealed the
gulf and contradiction that existed between the mass sentiments
expressed through the observation of Independence
Day and the political approach of the leadership represented
by Gandhi. The contents of Gandhi's statement can be summarised
as follows:

1. It thanked the Viceroy "for having cleared the
   atmosphere and let us know exactly where we (the rulers
   and the Indian people) stand".
2. The Congress is striving for the liberation of the
   starving peasants. In the struggle for its liberation, the
   Congress will make every effort to prevent it turning violent.
3. The Viceroy can take certain practical steps, if he
   desires to avoid a confrontation between the British rulers and
   the Indian people.

Gandhi explained these steps as follows:

a. Total prohibition.
b. Fix the rate of exchange at 1s. 4 d. per rupee.
Reduce the land tax at least by 50 percent and
bring that department under popular control.
d. Abolish the salt tax.
e. Reduction of military expenditure at least by fifty
percent as a first step towards reduction of military
expenditure.
f. Reduction of salary of the highest paid civil servant
at least by 50 percent in proportion to the reduction in
revenue incomes.
g. Protective tariff against foreign cloth.
h. Enactment of a bill reserving shipping to Indians.
i. Release of all political prisoners except those who
are sentenced for or undergoing trial for murder or attempted
murder; withdraw prosecution on political grounds; repeal
of section 124 (a) relating to treason and the 1918 Act relating
to detention without trial. Allow Indians living abroad
to return to India.
j. Abolition of the CID or bringing it under popular
control.
k. Issue of licences for fire-arms for self-defence,
subject to popular control.

It is obvious that these eleven demands put together
would not even mean _Dominion Status_, let alone _full
independence_. Hence, the statement aroused concern and
doubts among the leftists. Even Jawaharlal Nehru who was
officially the head of the Congress, was doubtful about these
"eleven-points".

But one who critically examines the events that took
place at each stage since Gandhi's entry into politics, needs
to have no doubt on that score. The _bourgeois_ leaders --- both
Gandhians and pro-legislaturists --- were utilizing every opportunity
to protect and develop its own (_bourgeois_) class
interest through negotiations with the British rulers and to
organize the common people, under strict control, in order
to create conditions for that. Gandhi's attempt to reduce the
national demand into the "eleven-points" within a month
after the adoption of the _full independence_ resolution was
another form of this method of struggle.

A close look at the "eleven-points" would reveal the
class interest that lay behind them. Most of them were the
demands raised by the industrial and commercial _bourgeoisie_.
While the demand for reduction or abolition of land tax, salt
tax, etc., which was of vital interest to the large majority of
poor peasants, the landless and workers, helped to rally the
large majority of the poor and the middle-classes, it did not
in the least hurt the interests of landlord-capitalist classes.
It is meaningful that Gandhi did not include such issues
as the heavy rent and interests borne by the peasantry and
the just wages for workers and middle class employees among
the burning problems faced by the poverty-stricken people
of India.

Even after the Lahore session, the congress leadership,
including Gandhi, was eager for starting negotiations with
the British. In fact, there were many intermediaries working
between the British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald
and the Congress leaders to arrive at a compromise and
Gandhi's "eleven-points" formed the basis of such a compromise.

However, the situation prevailing at that time was not
conducive for such negotiations. The mass sentiment that
swept across the country before and after the Lahore Congress
was against negotiations. Even if the Congress leaders
were willing to disregard this factor and start negotiations
with the British, the British rulers at that time were not
willing for talks. However great the mass support of the
Congress, there were the forces of communal-caste politics
ready to rally against it. The rulers thought that by using
these forces they could reject the national demand raised
by the Congress. This was evident form the repeated statements
made by the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State
for India in England and the Viceroy in India.

Thus, the politics of Gandhi who descended to the
"points" ended up in political kite-flying. The kite raised
by Gandhi, however, snapped in the storm of opposition
from the British government.

As a natural consequence of this, the Congress --- its
_bourgeois_ leadership --- was compelled to take an approach
of struggle. The _Working Committee_ which met at Sabarmati
for three days in the middle of February 1930 called
upon the people and Congress organizations to prepare for a
struggle. The Committee insisted that only those who take
non-violence as a creed (i. e, not as a practical policy)
should take part in the struggle. The Committee welcomed
Gandhi's willingness to lead the struggle subject
to this condition and authorized him and others who had
accepted non-violence as a creed to organize the struggle.
The Committee appealed to _Congressmen_ and the people
to extend all cooperation to the non-violence civil disobedience
to be launched under the leadership of Gandhi. The
Committee also suggested that with the launching of the
movement all those connected with official institutions, including
lawyers and students, should withdraw their cooperation
to the government.

An examination of this decision together with the statements
made by Gandhi before and after that would make
two things clear. First, the _bourgeois_ leadership including
Gandhi visualized a mass struggle in which people would be
brought to participate on the broadest possible scale. Second,
the leadership was particular that this mass struggle should
not go beyond the limits set by it and that if the doors of
negotiations with the British government were opened at any
stage of the struggle, that opportunity should be utilized to
negotiate with them.

As Gandhi himself had made it clear in a letter to the
Viceroy later and in many of his statements, the struggle
under his leadership was organized, on the one hand, against
the organized violence of the British government and, on the
other, against the tendencies of violence spreading widely
among the people. That is, the aim of struggle was to
convert the mass upsurge which Gandhi characterized as the
"violent tendency spreading rapidly all over the country"
into a mass movement that could be held in the grip of the
_bourgeoisie_ and from that position of strength bargain with
the British rulers.

Gandhi who had been authorized to lead the struggle
decided to organize country-wide civil disobedience on an
issue which was suited most for the purpose. Salt was an
essential article of the daily life of every family. The rules
and duties imposed by the British government for about
hundred years had deprived the people of their freedom to
make salt. On the immediate minimum demand that the
people should have the freedom to make salt, the Congress
under Gandhi evolved a form of struggle of breaking the
laws relating to the manufacture and distribution of salt.

This received country-wide publicity. While one section
ridiculed the form of struggle of breaking the law by making
salt from sea-water, another section was inspired by it. The
"_Salt Satyagraha_" was discussed all over the country. The
new wave of struggle swept across the country.

When statements regarding _Salt Satyagraha_ began to
come out, questions relating to its form and how and who
would lead it came up before the people. Things became
clear before long. It was made known that Gandhi himself
would inaugurate the _Salt Satyagraha_, accompanied by about 75 inmates of the Sabarmati _Ashram_. They would start on a
march on foot from the _Ashram_ on 12th March and reach
the village of Dandi on the coast of Gujarat on 5th April.
On the next day which coincides with the 11th anniversary
of the _Jhallianwala Bagh massacre_, they would make salt
from the sea-water.

What would happen if Gandhi was arrested during the 26-day-long Dandi March? Once Gandhi and his colleagues
reached Dandi and broke the salt law, would civil disobedience
be launched in other parts of the country? If so, how?
Would any other law besides the salt law be violated? If so,
who would decide it, how would it be conducted?

Innumerable questions of this nature came up before the
people and the Congress workers. Gandhi himself had
thought over these questions and discussed them with his close
colleagues. But, neither the people in general nor the Congress
workers knew what the decisions were. As for them,
this was of no consequence. They knew that India was going
to witness an unprecedented country-wide mass struggle and
that the Dandi March under Gandhi's leadership was its beginning.
They had read the reports on this march in the
newspapers. Articles comparing the Dandi March with other
earlier historic marches had attracted their attention. They
were thrilled by the idea that they were the eye-witnesses to
a historic event which would decisively influence the future
of the country as a whole. And they did not demand anything
more than this.

Meanwhile, Gandhi made another attempt to knock at
the door of negotiations. On 2nd March, ten days before
the start of the march, Gandhi wrote one more letter to the
Viceroy. Enumerating the misdeeds of the British rule which
was plundering India, he made it clear to the Viceroy that he
did not "intend harm to a single Englishman or to any legitimate
interest he may have in India". He also added that
his was an attempt also to convert the British people. He
appealed to the British to change their policies at least at that
late stage, and warned the Viceroy that if there was no indication
of such a change, he and his colleagues would proceed
to disregard the provisions of the salt law.

In response to the Viceroy's negative reply, Gandhi wrote:
"On bended knees I asked for bread and I have received
stone instead". He added: "It is open to the Viceroy to do
any other things except sending the usual reply. But the
time is not yet. He represents a nation that does not easily
give in, that does not easily repent ... It readily listens to
physical force ... The Viceroy's reply does not surprise me ...
the only public peace the nation knows is the peace of the
public prison ... India is one vast prison-house. I repudiate
this law, and regard it as my sacred duty to break the mournful
monotony of the compulsory peace that is chocking the
heart of the nation for want of free vent."

It had become obvious even before the Dandi march began
that it would develop into a great country-wide movement.
Therefore, Gandhi and the Dandi marchers led by him were
left free, while other Congress leaders were arrested and
sentenced. Vallabhbhai Patel who was on his way to organize
receptions to the Dandi marchers along their way, was arrested
and sentenced even before the march started. Other
Congress leaders were subjected to the same treatment all
over the country. But the national sentiments that had been
aroused around the Dandi March did not weaken. On the
contrary, the situation in the country as a whole had never
been so militant. In the place of one arrested, several more
came forward to take up his position. On one side were the
reports on the daily arrests, the trials and sentences, etc., and
the touching descriptions of the Dandi March which appeared
daily in the newspaper. On the other, there was the growing
determination on the part of the people in millions to surge
ahead braving all repressions until the victory is achieved.

It was in this emotion-packed background that Gandhi
and his followers reached Dandi on 5th April. Gandhi stated
that they would disregard the salt law the next morning, followed
by similar actions in different forms. Gandhi once
again wrote to the Viceroy with an appeal to abolish the salt
laws. Gandhi thus once again made it clear on behalf of the
national _bourgeoisie_ that positive response would be forthcoming
from the Congress if the rulers were willing to adopt the
path of negotiation even at that late stage. But the government
was not willing to oblige, which made the struggle
inevitable.
# TOWARDS _FULL INDEPENDENCE_

## THE DIVIDE AND RULE TACTICS

Whenever there was a mass upsurge, the British used to
resort to the divide and rule tactics to beat it back. As
we have seen earlier, they rallied the moderates against the
extremists and turned the Muslim big-wigs against the Congress
in 1905-06, and in 1919-21 used the moderates and
several communal and casteist organizations against the _Khilafat_-_non-cooperation_
movement. The same tactics were used
against the new mass upsurge which was started in 1928-29.

The first and foremost success they achieved was in the
field of trade union movement. As we know, workers'
organizations emerged in India linked with the freedom movement
in the wake of the extremist politics. We also know
that the attempts made by the British to stop this trend and
to make it an appendage of British imperialism and its agent,
the _Amsterdam International_, had failed. In 1928-29, they
adopted new tactics to make up this failure and to achieve
their objective. And they were successful in that attempt.

Along with the _Simon Commission_ which was appointed
to go into the question of constitutional reforms, certain other
commissions and committees had also been appointed by
the Government to draw the attention of the elite sections of
the Indian society to its side.

It had become necessary for the British _monopoly
capitalism_ to bring about a capitalist transformation in agriculture
in India. Changes in the agrarian structure too had
become necessary lo rally the landlord classes behind them.
For this purpose, an agricultural commission was appointed
with Lord Linlithgow as chairman. Similarly, a committee
with Sir Philip Hartog as chairman to prepare a report on
educational reforms to suit capitalist development and a
labour commission with Whitley as chairman were also appointed.
Whitley had the distinction of having drawn up a
number of planned schemes of industrial relations in Britain
which skillfully transformed the British trade union movement
into an appendage of British imperialism.

Since all these commissions and committees were intended
to protect the British imperialist rule, the militant sections
both inside and outside the Congress were against extending
cooperation to them. We have referred to earlier the
successful _boycott_ of the _Simon Commission_, the most important
of the these commissions, thanks to the unity of the left
and right forces inside and outside the Congress. A similar
approach was adopted by the leftists including the _Congressmen_
with regard to the _Whitely Commission_.

Although the left _Congressmen_ and Communists had
considerable influence in the _All-India Trade Union Congress_
(_AITUC_), the moderates were not an insignificant minority
in it. True, the _AITUC_ was far ahead of the Congress in
raising the immediate demands of the workers and in adopting
the objective of socialism. It may be noted that it
bad adopted the objective of socialism in 1928, some three
decades before the Congress adopted, formally though,
"socialistic pattern" as its objective.

However, the _AITUC_ was lagging behind the Congress
on matters relating to the general political issues of _anti-imperialism_.
For instance, on account of the opposition of
the moderate leadership, _AITUC_ could not adopt a resolution
to affiliate to the _League_ against Imperialison whereas, the
Congress had affiliated itself to the _League_ and sent delegates
to its world conference.

This becomes further clear from the approach adopted
by the Congress towards the _Simon Commission_ and the
attitude of the moderates in the _AITUC_ towards the
Whiteley Commission. Both the left and righl sections in
the Congress were united in the _boycott_ of the Simon Commisșion.
But there was no such a unity between the right and
left sections in the _AITUC_ in the _boycott_ of the _Whitely
Commission_. Further, the _AITUC_ split on this issue, the
first split in the Indian trade union movement.
Although a large number of top Congress leaders inculding
Tilak, Lajpat Rai and C. R. Das, had played a significant
role in the growth of the trade union movement.

there was a section of leaders under the political influence
of Gokhale and other moderates in the _AITUC_. Just as the
world Communist movement had influenced the leftists in
the _AITUC_, so the _Amsterdam International_ had influenced
the rightist trade union leaders. Thus, the leftist section
including the Congress who cooperated with the Communists
and other leftists and the rightists section under the influence
of the _Amsterdam International_ came to a clash with
each other.

The central point of dispute between these two groups
was the approach towards the Whiteley Commission. The
ruling circles who saw the depth and the extent of the people's
protest against the _Simon Commission_ were shrewd
enough to take the necessary precaution to see that the
commission on labour had Indian representatives.

Thus, the Whitley Commission had two representatives
of Indian workers on it. The moderate labour leaders,
N, M. Joshi and Dewan Chamanlal unilaterally agreed to
serve in the commission without consulting either the _AITUC_
or the different political groups in it. In fact, it was only
after they had accepted the membership that the very issue of
approach to the Commission came up before the _AITUC_.
Naturally, it aroused deep resentment among the delegates
to the Nagpur session of the _AITUC_ in 1929.

It was in the atmosphere of this resentment that the
decision to _boycott_ the Whitley Commission was adopted.
Simultaneously, two resolutions were passed, one demanding
the release of the accused in the _Meerut Conspiracy Case_
the other for affiliating the _AITUC_ with the _League_ against
Imperialism. Protesting against these resolutions adopted
by the majority, the moderate leadership walked out of the
conference and formed a rival trade union organization
based on moderatist outlook.

The British rulers realized that the success they had achieved
in splitting the trade union movement could not be
repeated easily in the political field. All shades of opinion from
the moderates outside the Congress to the leftists inside the
Congress and the different revolutionary groups outside, had
raised in one voice the demand of "at least a _Dominion
Status_". An ultimatum had already been served by the Congress
to the effect that if this demand was not conceded before 31st December 1929, _direct action_, including non-payment of
tax, would be launched. In the circumstances, the British
were forced to evolve a new tactic to engineer a split in the
political front.

Meanwhile, a political change favourable to this had
come about in Britain itself. In May 1929 the Labour Party
come to power defeating the ruling Conservatives. Although
the Commissions referred to above were appointed by the Conservative
Government, the Labour Party had played its own
role in all actions intended to tighten the British monopolist grip
on India. Therefore, it was clear that there would not be any
change in the government policy despite the Labour Party
being in power. But the Labour Party leaders had to pretend
that theirs was a government trying to protect the interests of
the British workers and the Indian democratic movement to
the extent possible. So, the Labour Party government came up
to take certain seemingly conciliatory steps without effecting
any fundamental change in the structure or terms of reference
of the _Simon Commission_. Thus, the Labour Prime Minister,
Ramsay MacDonald, called the Viceroy to England for
consultations. Further, it was proposed to hold a conference
in London with leaders of the different political parties and
sections to ascertain the Indian public opinion before enacting
an appropriate bill in accordance with the report of the
_Simon Commission_.

The Government accepted this proposal and the Viceroy
Lord Irwin accordingly issued a statement on 31st October.
In the statement, the Viceroy declared that the perspective
before the government in all considerations with regard to
constitutional reform, in general, was _Dominion Status_. It
marked the beginning of a calculated move to create disunity
between the Congress and the moderates, between thc leftists
and the rightists in the Congress, amog the different organizations
which dealt with communal-caste politics, including
the _Muslim League_ and between these sections,on the one hand
and the Congress, on the other. As we shall see later, these
proposed (Round Table) conferences turned out to be a
platform to stretch out these disputes and quarrels endlessly.

However, these tactics of the government failed for the
time being. An all-India leadership conference was held
in Delhi within 24 hours after Irwin issued the statement.
The Conference in which Congress leaders like Gandhi and
Motilal Nehru and the liberals like Sapru and the President
of the Central Assembly Vithalbhai Patel participated, decided
to accept the Viceroy's proposals subject to the following
conditions.

1. The scheme which should form the basis of discussion
   at the Conference should be the implementation of
   _Dominion Status_.
2. A majority of the delegates to the conference should
   be from the Congress.
3. All political prisoners should be released forthwith.
4. The functions of the existing government of India,
   as far as possible in the persent context, should be befitting
   a government of _Dominion Status_.

This resolution adopted by Congress and the moderates
outside it was, according to Jawaharlal Nehru, a success as
a decision of a conference in which the leftists and moderates
were participants; but as far as the Congress was concerned it
was a step backwards".

For the Congress, the four conditions included in the
resolusion were not negotiable. It the government were not
willing to accept them, the Congress would be unwilling to
cooperate with it. But, for liberals, this constituted their
maximum demand. Hence, they were willing for a compromise.
This was Nehru's evaluation of the resolution.

Thus the leadership conference of November 1929 ended
in creating conditions for a break between the Congress and
the liberals. However, it helped to keep the liberals with
the Congress at least for the time being. The resolution
also helped to prevent a rupture between the left and right
wings inside the Congress and to move them together into
a struggle to be launched under Gandhi's leadership.

In accordance with the Calcutta resolution, the leftists
were obliged to wait for a year; meanwhile, if the government
granted _Dominion Status_, then the Congress would
accept it. On the contrary, if the government was unwilling
to grant this demand, the Congress, including Gandhi, was
obliged to launch a struggle.

Gandhi and Motilal Nehru used the leadership conference
as a means to fulfil the obligations of both sides and at
the same time to maintain the unity of the Congress. They
utilized the developments following the leaders' conference to
accede to the demand of the left wing _Congressmen_ to move
along the path of _direct action_ as directed by the Calcutta
session, since the government had refused to concede even
the very moderate demands of a liberal leader like Sapru.

## PREPARATIONS FOR THE NEW STRUGGLE

The general thinking prevalent among the _Congressmen_
after the Calcutta session was that since the granting of
_Dominion Status_ within one year as demanded at the session
was highly improbable, the Congress must make all preparations
to launch a struggle. However, Gandhi had his own
view on the nature of such preparations. The form of struggle
that Gandhi had visualized was one of "complete non-violence",
and of mobilizing the national force of the masses
patiently tolerating all the repressions that might come
form the "other side". And this must be achieved through
the "constructive" programmes he had formulated.

Soon after the Calcutta session, the Congress Working
Committe appointed a number of sub-committees to strengthen
mass contact and also to implement the "constructive"
programme. The sub-committees were intended to take
care of _boycott_ of foreign cloth, prohibition of liquor, removal
of untouchability, Congress organization, volunteer
organization and redressal of women's grievances.

The sub-committees on all these issues (except on the
last which remained on paper only) worked vigorously. Gandhi
himself was the chairman of the committee for the
_boycott_ of foreign cloth. Rajagopalachari was in charge of
prohibition and Jamnalal Bajaj was to lead the activities for
the removal of untouchability. The tours and other activities
of these leaders, though conducted in connection with the
discharge of their specific responsibilities, did help to create
a general awareness among the people about the Congress
session scheduled for the year-end and the developments that
were likely to take place subsequent to it.

The work of the Congress and volunteer organizations
served to create a wide mass base, unprecedented except perhaps
for the 1920-21 period. This showed that the Congress
had begun to grow with a base firmer than what it was in 1920-21.

It was during this period that the _Hindusthan Seva Dal_,
a volunteer organization of Karnataka, became an all-India
organization. The _Seva Dal_ and its camps were utilized to
impart elementary physical training as well as political education
that were essential for the volunteers. Decisions were
taken to enrol a certain percentage of the total population
of the provinces as members of Congress and establish
functionally effective committees in at least a minimum
number of districts with active members of the Congress
contributing a fixed percentage of their income towards the
Congress fund. Work based on these decisions helped transform
the Congress into a well-knit mass organization.

Work in the legislatures had begun to bear the mark of
the impending struggle. In the Central Assembly, President
Vithalbhai Patel gave the ruling that a debate on the Public
Safety Bill in the House would prejudice a fair trial of the
_Meerut Conspiracy Case_ which was going on simultaneously.
The ruling and the speech made by the Viceroy in utter disregard
to the ruling caused a havoc in the Assembly. In Bengal,
following the repeated defeats of the government in the legislature,
the legislature itself was dissolved. The general
impact of these events was so great and the fighting mood
of the people so high that it was decided that the Congress
members in the Central and provincial assemblies needed
attend the legislatures only to retain their membership, utilizing
the rest of the time for political work.

The Congress movedon these lines at a time when the activities
of the revolutionaries, were going on with increased
vigour. The _Lahore Conspiracy Case_ trial involving Bhagat
Singh and his colleagues was progressing. The fast undertaken
by the accused in the jail and the death of one of them
(Jatin Das) had made the Indian people in general and the
youth in particular indignant. Proceedings of the _Meerut
Conspiracy Case_ involving many prominent Communist, and
_non-Communist_ trade union workers were also going on. A
large number of nationalist activists including many prominent
Congress leaders were imprisoned on various counts.

In this background, there was a widespread feeling
that the "_constructive programme_", organizational work and
partial _boycott_ of the legislature, etc., being carried out by
the Congress leadership were inadequate to meet the situation.
All this turned out to make the soil fertile for bomb-politics.

It was in these backgrounds that the leaders of the
Congress and the moderates entered into negotiations with
the British. This evoked sharp protests from the ranks,
as a reflection of which Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas
Chandra Bose who were regarded as leftist leaders tendered
resignation form the _Congress Working Committee_. The
revolutionaries outside the Congress who were engaged
in bomb-politics intensified their activities. They even tried
to blow up the train in which the Viceroy was travelling,
injuring some of his attendants. It was obvious that the
attack on the viceregal train was intended to prevent the
negotiations between the Viceroy and the Congress leaders
or at least to make them fruitless.

It was in this background again that the question came
up as to who should be the president of the Lahore session.
The general consensus was that at a time when a struggle for
independence was imminent, Gandhi was the only individual
strong enough to be its commander-in-chief. Ten provincial
committees proposed his name. The name of Vallabhbhai
Patel was proposed by five PCCs. Patel's nomination was
obviously in recognition of the leadership that he had given
to the successful Bardoli peasant struggle and of his capability
to lead the forthcoming struggle. Jawaharlal Nehru with
the support of three provinces was placed in the third position
in the list of presidential candidates.

Gandhi, however, decined his nomination. Nor did he
approve of the nomination of Patel who was in the second
position, Instead, he expressed his opinion in favour of
Jawaharlal Nehru whose position was third in the list. The
entire Congress leadership including Patel accepted Gandhi's
porposal. Thus, Jawaharlal Nehru who had never concealed
opposition to the policies pursued by the Congress leadership
including Gandhi and Motilal Nehru, was elected president
of the Congress.

This was an incident that invited considerablc debate
in the political circles. What was the secret behind Gandhi,
the trusted leader of the majority, giving up the presidentship
of the Congress in favour of Jawaharlal Nehru, the
representative of a minority in the Congress? Why did the
entire Congress leadership decide to transfer the Congress
presidentship from the renowned moderate leader Motilal to
his son Jawaharlal? How far personal sentiments like Gandhi's
interest in Jawaharlal and Motilal's affection to his son infiuenced
the decision?

We have referred to above certain facts helpful in finding
answers to these questions. No matter how extensive
the popular force the Congress was able to rally behind
itself through "_constructive programmes_" and organizational
work, this alone was not sufficient to conduct a bitter antiBritishs
trụggle. For the leftists inside and outside the Congress
were not less active and militant than the Congress workers
who were engaged in _constructive programmes_ or organized
in _Seva Dals_. Only a leadership capable of mobilizing their
sense of self-sacrifice and cautious activities would be
able to inspire the millions in the struggle. Realizing this fact,
it was necessary to create the impression both among the
people and the Congress workers that the young generation of
leftists was being brought up to the leadership position.

Another factor that promted Gandhi to propose Jawaharlal
to the presidentship of the Congress was his opinion
about his personality. However strongly he might express
his leftist ideology in his articles and speeches, Jawaharlal
Nehru was in the final analysis a "disciplined" disciple of
Gandhi. True, he was a staunch opponent of the views of
his father and leader; but when faced with practical politics
Jawaharlal transforms himself into a devoted Gandhian --- this
was Gandhi's assessment of Jawaharlal's personality.

For instance, nominating Jawaharlal to the presidentship
Gandhi stated: "And if he has the dash and the rashness of a
warrior, he has also the prudence of a stalesman. A lover
of discipline, he has shown himself to be capable of rigidly
submitting to it even where it has seemed irksome. He is
undoubtedly an extremist, thinking far ahead of his surroundings.
But he is humble and practical enough not to force
to pace to the breaking point. He is pure as a crystal, he
is faithful beyond suspecion. He is a knight _sans peur_, _sans
reproche_. The nation is safe in his hands."[^13-1/1]

Subsequent events have proved the correctness of this
assessment. In his first presidential address and in numerous
speeches, statements and articles that followed, Nehru formulated
his leftist thoughts. Offen it brought crises in the
leadership circles of the Congress and on occasions, he had to
give up the leadership position to freely express his dissent.
But on all such occasions he remained a trusted follower of
Gandhi. Whenever formidable challenges were raised against
the Gandhian leadership, its outlook and programmes, Jawaharlal
created the impression among the people that he stood
"between Gandhi and the leftists". In effect, however, he
had been saving the Gandhian leadership from the challenges
it had been facing. In the following pages, we shall see this
repeating again and again. Here we will only point out the
understanding Gandhi and other leaders had on the forthcoming
struggle following the Lahore Congress and the role
played by the election of Jawaharlal Nehru in the struggle.

It would be useful here to make a comparative analysis
of the struggles of 1920-21 and the forthcoming struggle of 1928-29. The basis of the former was the popular reaction
to the deepening economic and political crises in the post-war
years. Gandhi tried to provide an organized form to this
popular reaction for which he was the most skillful and experienced
of all the _bourgeois_ political leaders. He was
successful in accomplishing this by raising such simple slogans
as "_Swaraj_ in one year", collecting the Tilak _Swaraj_ Fund
and propagating the spinning wheel. And the limitations of
this approach were demonstrated themselves through the
_Chauri Chaura_ and other incidents.

[^13-1/1]: D. G. Tendulkar, _Mahatma_, Vol II, New Delhi, Publications Division, 1969, p. 372.

The situation in 1928-29 was different. There were now
not only the masses who had imbibed the spirit of mass
struggles, but also organized movements borne out of their
struggles as well as the revolutionary ideologies leading
them. There were the trade unions and their strike struggles,
the youth organizations and their forms of struggle, the agitations
and struggles of the peasantry and the revolutionary
organizations imbibing the communist and socialist ideologies
which had tremendously influenced these movements and
struggles. The impact of all these was found on the ranks and
active workers of the Congress as well as on a section of its
leadership. Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose and
other leaders of the younger generation, in fact, emerged as
the representatives of these sections.

It was a necessity for the _bourgeois_ Congress leadership
including Gandhi, to rally under its own banner these new
forces which had not yet emerged in 1920-21. At the same
time, they had to see to it that these revolutionary forces did
not cross the bounds set by the _bourgeois_ leadership on to
dangerous' paths. In other words, they had to "tame" these
revolutionary forces which were likely to constitute themselves
a challenge to the _bourgeois_ leadership. The most
suitable means for it was to install as Congress president a
widely accepted "young leader" like Jawaharlal who was a
devoted disciple of Gandhi and to exercise the control of the
right wing leadership on him.

Although the present decision pertained only to the
question of who should preside over the Lahore session of
the Congress, it marked the beginning of the future
developments. Through this decision Gandhi declared that his
successor in Indian politics would be none of the well known
Gandhians like Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajagopalachari and
Rajendra Prasad, but Jawaharlal Nehru who was known to
be an opponent of himself. The kind of _freedom struggle_
Gandhi visualized would not be complete even with leaders
like the eminent parliamentarian, Motilal Nehru and constructive
workers like Patel and Rajagopalachari. For that
purpose the leftist forces represented by Jawaharlal Nehru
must also be mobilized. Not only that. There must be a
guarantee that the leftist forces thus mobilized did not go
boyond the control of the social forces which he represented.
Gandhi was able to accomplish all this. And he knew that
Jawaharlal Nehru would be of greatest assistance to him in
"taming the leftist forces".

We have referred to earlier the statement of Tilak that
Gandhi represented the new mass upsurge and that he would
not stand in his way. Now the situation was somewhat
different from what was known as the "end of the Tilak era".
In 1928-29, Gandhi could not claim the sole representation
of the mass upsurge; Gandhi's leadership would become useful
and effective only if the new revolutionary forces represented
by Jawaharlal Nehru were mobilized. However, without
Gandhi and his right wing leadership, Jawaharlal would not
become the full representative of the new popular upsurge.
In other words, the _bourgeois_ national leadership would be
complele only if the disciples of Gandhi, the parliamentarians
and the younger generation of the left forces were brought
together. The election of Jawaharlal Nehru was an open
declaration of this fact.

## THE LAHORE SESSION

At the midnight of 31st December 1929, the hour at
which the one year grace period given at the Calcutta session
of December 1928 ended, the Lahore session of the Congress
passed the resolution affirming _full independence_ as the
national objective. Soon after, the delegates led by President
Jawaharlal Nehru left the _Pandal_ to unfurl the Indian independence
flag.

The resolution was adopted almost unanimously, with
hardly 15 hands raising against in a gathering of thousands
of delegates. It was a rare spectacle of the disciples of
Gandhi, advocates of participation in legislature, leftists
and all other sections rallying behind the objective of _full
independence_ and the imminent struggle to achieve the
objective. A new voice of mass upsurge reverberated throughout
the country.

But behind this demonstration of unity revealed the
intense clash that took place among the various trends of
political thought and groups. On a number of occasions,
divisions were taken for voting and issues decided with a
narrow majority. Even in the case of the main resolution
on _full independence_, its different clauses came under heavy
attack before they were adopted with a narrow margin of
votes.

Though the president of the session was an acknowledged
leftist leader, the leftists moved a number of amendments
to many resolutions and to many clauses of the main
resolution moved officially. The point by point fight they put
up ended in votings. In the final stage of the session, Subhas
Bose and other lefist leaders who could not agree with the
leadership on the composition of the new _Working Committee_,
formed a new organization called the Congress Democratic
Party. Only the civil disobedience movement which was
launched a few weeks after that could save the Congress
from another split.

As we know, Jawaharlal Nehru was installed president
of the Congress as the representative of the younger generation
with leftist ideologies. In fact, his presidential address
was in consonance with the expectations of the delegates as
well as of the people at large. In the address, Jawaharlal
Nehru declared that he was a socialist and republican
fighting againat all royal and feudal privileges. It was for
the first time that a Congress President was delivering such
a speech. And it was on this basis that he handled issues
like full indepenance and opposition to _Dominion Status_.

Based on the experience he had gained through the
participation in the Anti-imperialist _League_ and the visit to
the Soviet Union, he tried to link the _freedom struggle_ with the
world-wide anti-imperialist struggle and to the advance of
socialism. At the same time, he was of the view that
the struggle under the leadership of the Congress must be
valued as high as or even greater than his own views as a
leftist. In the Presidential address, he made clear that he
was endeavouring to get along well with his colleagues including
the Gandhians, on a number of issues such as the
role of non-violence in the struggle. Consequently he remained
firm with the leadership rather than with his leftist colleagues
like Subhas Bose on questions of the composition of the
_Working Committee_ and the subsequent formation of the
Congress Democratic Party.

The position taken by Nehru as president in no way
influenced the leftist delegates. As mentioned above, they
fought out issue by issue. They even defeated some of the
proposals put forward by Gandhi by joining hands with
other non-Gandhian sections. For example, Gandhi suggested
that the programmes of the _boycott_ of foreign cloth, prohibition
and removal of untouchability should be conducted
under the auspices of organizations independent of the
Congress. (The manufacture and sale of _Khadi_ had already
been entrusted to the Spinners' Association, an organization
independent of the Congress.) This suggestion was rejected.
Similarly, as with the means of struggle, Gandhi suggested
that "peaceful and just" be replaced by "truthfull and _non-violent_".
This too was rejected.

However, the sharpest confrontation was between the
leftists on the one hand and the disciples of Gandhi and the
advocates of participation in the legislature on the other. It was
as a sequel to this that the leadership had secured only a
narrow margin of votes. For example, the leadership had
moved a resolution condemning the bomb attack of the train
in which the Viceroy was travelling just a week before the
Lahore Congress. It was passed by a margin of only 48
votes.

Again, the resolution on _full independence_ began with an
appreciation of the statement of the leadership made in response
to the Viceroy's announcement of 31st October and the
efforts made by the Viceroy. This part of the resolution evoked
heated discussions. The left wing contented that the statement
of the leadership was a backpedalling from the objective
of the Congress and the Viceroy's announcement a trap. On
this issue the leadership could carry only a narrow majority
of 180 votes with them.

The main resolution _inter alia_ stated that "nothing is
to be gained in the existing circumstances by the Congress
being represented at the proposed _Round Table Conference_."
The phrase "in the existing circumstances" was subjected to
severe criticism. The left argued that this phrase was a
loophole left by the leadership in the resolution to enable
them to participate in a _round table conference_ in the future
on the pretext of "changed circumstances". Here also the
combined force of Gandhians and the protagonists of parliamentary
activities defeated the left wing with a narrow
margin.

The main resolution finally emerged in the session was
one that inspired a large majority of the delegates and even
the entire country, except a few among the protagonists of
parliamentary activities. The major features of the resolution
are as follows.

1) Although appreciating the Viceroy and leadership
   which issued the statement following his announcement and
   with the phrase "in the existing circumstances", the resolution
   declared that the Congress would not attend the _Round
   Table Conference_ to be called by the British.
2) Since the grace period allowed by the Calcutta
   session had come to an end and also since the moves made
   by the government in conceding the national demand was not
   satisfactory, the session declared that the immediate demand
   of the Congress was _full independence_. As a corollary of
   this, the Motilal _Nehru Report_ envisaging _Dominion Status_
   had become out-dated.
3) As a preliminary step towards organizing a campaign
   for _full independence_, the session called upon complete
   _boycott_ of the legislatures and committees constituted by the
   government and directed _Congressmen_ and others taking
   part in the national movement to abstain from participating
   in the future elections and the present members of the legislatures
   to resign their seats.
4) While appealing the people to zealously carry on the
   _constructive programmes_ of the Congress, the resolution authorized
   the _AICC_ "where it deems fit, to launch upon a
   programme of civil disobedience, including the non-payment
   of taxes, whether in selected areas or otherwise and under
   such safeguards as it may consider necessary".

The Lahore session adopted two other resolutions which
deserve special mention. One of them requested the rulers
of the princely states to establish responsible governments in
the states and guarantee the protection of civil liberties of
the people. This represented a change in the policy of
"non-interference in the internal affairs of the princely states"
which had hitherto been followed by the Gandhian
leadership of the Congress.

The other resolution was more sensational. It was a reiteration
of a resolution passed earlier at the Gaya session
making it clear that the Indian people would not be held responsible
for the unjust public debt imposed by the British
rulers on India. It also warned the prospective creditors of
future debts that free India would be liable to pay back the
debt only if it was convinced that it was just and reasonable.

These resolutions showed that the Congress which was
preparing for a struggle to achieve the immediate objective
of _full independence_ had started taking a different attitude
towards the rulers of the princely states who were the benchmen
of the British and towards those who were giving
the British government financial assistance. In other words,
the _bourgeois_ leadership became convinced of the need for
such a new approach to inspire the people to take part in the
_freedom struggle_ which was going to be launched within a
few weeks.

However, the composition of the new _Working Committee_
formed after the Lahore session was not in accord with the
leftist ideology expressed in the presidential address and in the
resolutions passed in the session. The leftists did not get
representation in the _Working Committee_ in proportion to
their strength among the delegates as displayed by the pattern
of voting on the different resolutions. All members in the
committee, except President Jawaharlal Nehru, were either
the disciples of Gandhi or the advocates of parliamentary
participation. It may be noted that the demand of the leftists
that the election to the _Working Committee_ must be democratic
was rejected by the leadership. Thus, Jawaharlal
Nehru became the head of a leadership which was formed
in a manner which was not in correspondence with the political
thinking current among the delegates and the common
people.

But surpassing all these issues and pushing them to the
background, the problem of the imminent struggle for _full
independence_ came up before the people. The new _Working
Committee_ met soon after the close of the Congress session
and decided to observe 26th January as _Full Independence_
Day throughout the country as the first step towards making
preparation for the struggle. The _Working Committee_ also
prepared a declaration to be read and adopted throughout
the country, as part of the observation of Independence Day.
The text of the declaration which inspired the entire people
and was repeated many a time is as follows.

We believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian
people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to
enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of
life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth.
We believe also that if any government deprives a people
of these rights and oppresses them, the people have a
further right to alter it or to abolish it. The British government
in India has not only deprived the Indian people
of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of
the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically,
culturally and spiritually. We believe, therefore, that India
must sever the British connection and attain _Purna Swaraj_
or Complete Independence.

India has been ruined economically. The revenue derived
from our people is out of all propotion to our income.
Our average income is seven pice, less than two pence,
per day, and of the heavy taxes we pay, twenty percent
are raised from the land revenue derived from the peasantry
and three percent from the salt tax, which falls
most heavily on the poor.

Village industries, such as handspinning, have been destroyed,
leaving the peasantry idle for at least four months in
the year, and dulling their intellect for want of handicrafts,
and nothing has been substituted, as in other countries,
for the crafts thus destroyed.

Customs and currency have been so manipulated as 10
heap further burdens on the peasantry, The British manifactured
goods constitute the bulk of our imports. Customs
duties betray clear partiality for British manufacturers,and
revenue form them is used not to lessen the burden on the
masses, but for sustaining a highly extravagant administration.
Still more arbitrary has been the manipulation of
the exchange ratio which has resulted in millions being
drained away from the country.

Politically, India's status has never been so reduced, as
under the British regime. No reforms have given real
political power to the people. The tallest of us have to
bend before fereign authority. The rights of free expression
of opinion and free association have been denied to
us, and many of our countrymen are compelled to live in
exile abroad and they cannot return to their homes. All
administrative talent is killed, and the masses have to be
satisfied with petty village offices and clerkships.
Culturally, the system of education has tom us from our
moorings, our training has made us hug the very chains
that bind us.

Spiritually, compulsory disarmament has made us unmanly,
and the presence of an alien army of occupation, employed
with deadly effect to crush in us the spirit of resistance,
has made us think that we cannot look after ourselves or
put up a defence against foreign aggression, or defend
our homes and families from the attacks of thieves, robbers,
and miscreants.

We hold it to be a crime against man and God to submit
any longer to a rule that has caused this four fold disaster
in our country. We recognise, therefore, that the most effective
way of gaining our freedom is not through violence.
We will prepare ourselves by withdrawing, so far as we can,
all voluntary association from the British Government,
and will prepare for civil disobedience including non-payment
of taxes. We are convinced that if we can but
withdraw our voluntary help, stop payment of taxes without
doing violence, even under provocation, the end of
this inhuman role is assured. We, therefore, hereby
solemnly resolve to carry out the Congress instructions
issued from time to time for the purpose of establishing
_Purna Swaraj_.

This Independence Pledge is a milestone in the history
not only of the _Indian National Congress_ but in the journey
of the entire people of the country.

## THE DANDI MARCH

The Independence Day was first observed on 26th
January 1930 all over the country. There was no province
or district which kept aloof from it. The thousands of public
meetings and the tens of thousands people who took the pledge
of complete independence made the resolution adopted at the
Lahore Congress and the pledge prepared by the _Congress
Working Committee_ the common property of the people of
the country.

The rulers got into a panic about the popular emotion
that swept across the country. They tried to meet it with
_lathi-charges_ and firings. Many, including the renowned
leftist leader, Subhas Bose, were arrested and sentenced to
long terms of imprisonment.

However, the rulers realized that the people's upsurge
for complete independence could not be suppressed by these
actions. Consequently they initiated certain "conciliatory"
moves. Within 24 hours of the Independence Day observation,
Lord Irwin issued a statement to "remove the doubts"
in the minds of the Indians on the nature of the _Round Table
Conference_. It was a repetition of the statements made
earlier by the Viceroy himself and the British ministers.
However, it was couched in a language of appeasement.

In response to this, Gandhi made a statement which
deserves particular attention. The statement revealed the
gulf and contradiction that existed between the mass sentiments
expressed through the observation of Independence
Day and the political approach of the leadership represented
by Gandhi. The contents of Gandhi's statement can be summarised
as follows:

1. It thanked the Viceroy "for having cleared the
   atmosphere and let us know exactly where we (the rulers
   and the Indian people) stand".
2. The Congress is striving for the liberation of the
   starving peasants. In the struggle for its liberation, the
   Congress will make every effort to prevent it turning violent.
3. The Viceroy can take certain practical steps, if he
   desires to avoid a confrontation between the British rulers and
   the Indian people.

Gandhi explaincd these steps as follows:

a. Total prohibition.
b. Fix the rate of exchange at 1s. 4 d. per rupee.
Reduce the land tax at least by 50 percent and
bring that department under popular control.
d. Abolish the salt tax.
e. Reduction of military expenditure at least by fifty
percent as a first step towards reducation of military
expenditure.
f. Reduction of salary of the highest paid civil servant
at least by 50 percent in proportion to the reduction in
revenue incomes.
g. Protective tariff against foreign cloth.
h. Enactment of a bill reserving shipping to Indians.
i. Release of all political prisoners except those who
are sentenced for or undergoing trial for murder or attempted
murder; withdraw prosecution on political grounds; repeal
of section 124 (a) relating to treason and the 1918 Act relating
to detention witout trial. Allow Indians living abroad
to return to India.
j. Abolitian of the CID or bringing it under popular
control.
k. Issue of licences for fire-arms for self-defence,
subject to popular control.

It is obvious that these eleven demands put together
would not even mean _Dominion Status_, let alone _full
independence_. Hence the statement aroused concern and
doubts among the leftists. Even Jawaharlal Nehru who was
officially the head of the Congress, was doubtful about these
"eleven-points".

But one who critically examines the events that took
place at each stage since Gandhi's entry into politics, needs
to have no doubt on that score. The _bourgeois_ leaders --- both
Gandhians and pro-legislaturists --- were utilizing every opportunity
to protect and develop its own (_bourgeois_) class
interest through negotiations with the British rulers and to
organize the comman people, under strict control, in order
to create conditions for that. Gandhi's attempt to reduce the
national demand into the "eleven-points" within a month
after the adoption of the _full independence_ resolution was
another form of this method of struggle.

A close look at the "eleven-points" would reveal the
class interest that lay behind them. Most of them were the
demands raised by the industrial and commercial _bourgeoisie_.
While the demand for reduction or abolition of land tax, salt
tax, etc., which was of vital interest to the large majority of
poor peasants, the landless and workers, helped to rally the
large majority of the poor and the middle-classes, it did not
in the least hurt the interests of landlord-capitalist classes.
It is meaningful that Gandhi did not include such issues
as the heavy rent and interests borne by the peasantry and
the just wages for workers and middle class employees among
the burning problems faced by the poverty stricken people
of India.

Even after the Lahore session, the congress leadership,
including Gandhi, was eager for starting negotiations with
the British. In fact, there were many intermediaries working
between the British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald
and the Congress leaders to arrive at a compromise and
Gandhi's "eleven-points" formed the basis of such a compromise.

However, the situation prevailing at that time was not
conducive for such negotiations. The mass sentiment that
swept across the country before and after the Lahore Congress
was against negotiations. Even if the Congress leaders
were willing to disregard this factor and start negotiations
with the British, the British rulers at that time were not
willing for talks. However great the mass support of the
Congress, there were the forces of communal-caste politics
ready to rally against it. The rulers thought that by using
these forces they could reject the national demand raised
by the Congress. This was evident form the repeated statements
made by the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State
for India in England and the Viceroy in India.

Thus, the politics of Gandhi who descended to the
"points" ended up in political kite-flying. The kite raised
by Gandhi, however, snapped in the storm of opposition
from the British government.

As a natural consequence of this, the Congress --- its
_bourgeois_ leadership --- was compelled to take an approach
of struggle. The _Working Committee_ which met at Sabarmati
for three days in the middle of February 1930 called
upon the people and Congress organizations to prepare for a
struggle. The Committee insisted that only those who take
non-violence as a creed (i. e, not as a practical policy)
should take part in the struggle. The Committee welcomed
Gandhi's willingness to lead the struggle subject
to this condition and authorized him and others who had
accepted non-violence as a creed to organize the struggle.
The Committee appealed to _Congressmen_ and the people
to extend all cooperation to the non-violence civil disobedience
to be launched under the leadership of Gandhi. The
Commillee also suggested that with the launching of the
movement all those connected with official institutions, including
lawyers and students, should withdraw their cooperation
to the government.

An examination of this decision togetherwith the statements
made by Gandhi before and after that would make
two things clear. First, the _bourgeois_ leadership including
Gandhi visualized a mass struggle in which people would be
brought to participate on the broadest possible scale. Second,
the leadership was particular that this mass struggle should
not go beyond the limits set by it and that if the doors of
negotiations with the British government were opened at any
stage of the struggle, that opportunity should be utilized to
negotiate with them.

As Gandhi himself had made it clear in a letter to the
Viceroy later and in many of his statements, the struggle
under his leadership was organized, on the one hand, against
the organized violence of the British government and, on the
other, against the tendencies of violence spreading widely
among the people. That is, the aim of struggle was to
convert the mass upsurge which Gandhi characterized as the
"violent tendency spreading rapidly all over the country"
into a mass movement that could be held in the grip of the
_bourgeoisie_ and from that position of strength bargain with
the British rulers.

Gandhi who had been authorized to lead the struggle
decided to organize country-wide civil disobedience on an
issue which was suited most for the purpose. Salt was an
essential article of the daily life of every family. The rules
and duties imposed by the British government for about
hundred years had deprived the people of their freedom to
make salt. On the immediate minimum demand that the
people should have the freedom to make salt, the Congress
under Gandhi evolved a form of struggle of breaking the
laws relating to the manufacture and distribution of salt.

This received country-wide publicity. While one section
ridiculed the form of struggle of breaking the law by making
salt from sea-water, another section was inspired by it. The
"_Salt Satyagraha_" was discussed all over the country. The
new wave of struggle swept across the country.

When statements regarding _Salt Satyagraha_ began to
come out, questions relating to its form and how and who
would lead it came up before the people. Things became
clear before long. It was made known that Gandhi himself
would inaugurate the _Salt Satyagraha_, accompanied by about 75 inmates of the Sabarmati _Ashram_. They would start on a
march on foot from the _Ashram_ on 12th March and reach
the village of Dandi on the coast of Gujarat on 5th April.
On the next day which coincides with the 11th anniversary
of the _Jhallianwala Bagh massacre_, they would make salt
from the sea-water.

What would happen if Gandhi was arrested during the 26 day long Dandi March? Once Gandhi and his colleagues
reached Dandi and broke the salt law, would civil disobedience
be launched in other parts of the country? If so, how?
Would any other law besides the salt law be violated? If so,
who would decide it, how would it be conducted?

Innumerable questions of this nature came up before the
people and the Congress workers. Gandhi himself had
thought over these questions and discussed them with his close
colleagues. But, neither the people in general nor the Congress
workers knew what the decisions were. As for them,
this was of no consequence. They knew that India was going
to witness an unprecedented country-wide mass struggle and
that the Dandi March under Gandhi's leadership was its beginning.
They had read the reports on this march in the
newspapers. Articles comparing the Dandi March with other
earlier historic marches had attracted their attention. They
were thrilled by the idea that they were the eye-witnesses to
a historic event which would decisively influence the future
of the country as a whole. And they did not demand anything
more than this.

Meanwhile, Gandhi made another attempt to knock at
the door of negotiations. On 2nd March, ten days before
the start of the march, Gandhi wrote one more letter to the
Viceroy. Enumerating the misdeeds of the British rule which
was plundering India, he made it clear to the Viceroy that he
did not "intend harm to a single Englishman or to any legitimate
interest he may have in India". He also added that
his was an attempt also to convert the British people. He
appealed to the British to change their policies at least at that
late stage, and warned the Viceroy that if there was no indication
of such a change, he and his colleagues would proceed
to disregard the provisions of the salt law.

In response to the Viceroy's negative reply, Gandhi wrote:
"On bended knees I asked for bread and I have received
stone instead". He added: "It is open to the Viceroy to do
any other things except sending the usual reply. But the
time is not yet. He represents a nation that does not easily
give in, that does not easily repent... It readily listens to
physical force... The Viceroy's reply does not surprise me...
the only public peace the nation knows is the peace of the
public prison.. India is one vast prison-house. I repudiate
this law, and regard it as my sacred duty to break the mournful
monotony of the compulsary peace that is chocking the
heart of the nation for want of free vent."

It had become obvious even before the Dandi march began
that it would develop into a great country-wide movement.
Therefore Gandhi and the Dandi marchers led by him were
left free, while other Congress leaders were arrested and
sentenced. Vallabhbhai Patel who was on his way to organize
receptions to the Dandi marchers along their way, was arrested
and sentenced even before the march started. Other
Congress leaders were subjected to the same treatment all
over the country. But the national sentiments that had been
aroused around the Dandi March did not weaken. On the
contrary, the situation in the country as a whole had never
been so militant. In the place of one arrested, several more
came forward to take up his position. On one side were the
reports on the daily arrests, the trials and sentences, etc., and
the touching descriptions of the Dandi March which appeared
daily in the newspaper. On the other, there was the growing
determination on the part of the people in millions to surge
ahead braving all repressions until the victory is achieved.

It was in this emotion-packed background that Gandhi
and his followers reached Dandi on 5th April. Gandhi stated
that they would disregard the salt law the next morning, followed
by similar actions in different forms. Gandhi once
again wrote to the Viceroy with an appeal to abolish the salt
laws. Gandhi thus once again made it clear on behalf of the
national _bourgeoisie_ that positive response would be forthcoming
from the Congress if the rulers were willing to adopt the
path of negotiation even at that late stage. But the government
was not willing to oblige, which made the struggle
inevitable.
