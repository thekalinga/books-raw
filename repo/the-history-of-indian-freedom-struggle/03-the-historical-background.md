# THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

## INDIA BEFORE FOREIGN DOMINATION

It has often been argued that those who formulated the
theory of _Historical Materialism_ were ignorant about India
and other countries of Asia, and therefore, _Historical
Materialism_ is not relevant to India or to its contemporary
problems. This is false. For, Marx and Engels were scholar-revolutionaries
who viewed the entire world with the fundamental
perspective of the _bourgeois_ democratic revolution that
was sweeping Europe and of the working class movement
that was part of it, and strove to help social transformations
everywhere. In the midst of their revolutionary activities,
they also attempted to evaluate the developments in India in
the background of the development of _World Capitalism_,
basing themselves on the materials accessible to scholars in
Europe at that time. However, no Marxist would claim that
the opinions they expressed resulting from these studies were
complete or faultless. Yet anyone who reads through their
works would admit that they were able to go deep into the
social transformation that was taking place in India and
perceive its essence in a manner in which other historical
investigators of their time were unable to do.

Marx and Engels wrote a number of articles in the
_New-York Daily Tribune_ in the 1850s which were of critical
importance in the history of British rule in India. Not
long after they wrote these articles, the struggle for independence,
which the British called the "_Sepoy Mutiny_", started.
They also wrote several articles when the struggle was going
on, observing the day-to-day development of events.

Though most of these articles were written by Marx
himself, Marx and Engels were constantly exchanging ideas
on the Indian developments, as they did on other issues.
Therefore, it can be rightly stated that these articles were
the result of the joint thinking of the two individuals who
formulated the concepts of _Historical Materialism_. These
articles have been collected and published in the form of a
book entitled, _The First Indian War of Independence (1857--1859)_.
No one who takes even a cursory glance at these
articles can dismiss the relevance to India of the theory of
_Historical Materialism_ under the pretext that those who formulated
it were ignorant about India.

The materials on which Marx based himself for comprehending
the nature and development of _World Capitalism_ and
for determining its future development were the facts relating
to the development of _Capitalism_ in England, which was the
most advanced capitalist country in the world at that time.
In particular, the statistics the rulers of England collected, the
reports they prepared, and the debates in British Parliament
and the press based on these materials, helped Marx to reveal
the real character of _Capitalism_ through his works, including
_Capital_. Similarly, the facts gathered by the British authorities
on India and the opinions formed on the basis of these
facts helped Marx to form his own opinion. Nevertheless,
just as in the case of _World Capitalism_, Marx was able to take
an approach with regard to India, which was diametrically
opposed to the views of the ruling circles.

However, Marx's evaluation of India was neither complete
nor faultless in its details. This becomes obvious if one
considers the volume of knowledge gained through studies
made by Indian as well as foreign scholars during the past
several decades since Marx wrote his articles on India. But
he was able to evaluate India's past and the changes being
introduced by the British rulers as well as the future results
of these changes. All this he did in such an amazingly accurate
fashion that it far outweighs the inadequacies in the
details of his analysis. In particular, this evaluation was done
from the viewpoint of a future Indian working class which
had not emerged on the Indian scene then.

As in all countries witnessing the advance of _Capitalism_,
a conflict was taking place in India also between the old pre-capitalist
forces and the new capitalist forces. Marx's
approach was one that helped the rising working class to
organize itself against the new dominating class of the _bourgeoisie_.
That was why the _Communist Manifesto_, which declares
that "the _bourgeoisie_, historically, has played a most
revolutionary part", states: "The other classes decay and
finally disappear in the face of modern industry; the _proletariat_
is its special and essential product."

There are two elements that distinguish the situation in
India from that in the European countries where Marx and
Engels conducted their practical political activities. The first
concerns the conflict between the old and the new, which in
India assumed the form of a conflict between the natives and
foreign rulers. This is because in India, the old was represented
by the native feudal lords and other representatives of
the old social system and the forces that overthrew them were
the foreigners. In Europe, on the other hand, the representatives
of both the old and the new were the natives themselves.

Marx is sympathetic to the foreign rulers to the extent
that they tried to destroy the old social system in India. But
since the old is replaced by suppression and exploitation
under the foreign domination, Marx expresses the anguish
and indignation of a revolutionary against foreign domination.

The second factor that distinguishes India of those days
was the fact that a working class had not yet emerged here,
whereas in all the European countries, that class, however
small it might have been, had already started emerging.
There the working class was becoming an organized force by
standing by the side of the _bourgeoisie_ in the fight against
_feudalism_ and for the establishment of democracy. Therefore,
right in the struggle between the old and the new, a
new (working) class, a class which is destined to "dig the
grave" of the dominant class within the new, had started
emerging. This was not the case with India. Here the conflict
was between the foreign rulers trying to subjugate India
by destroying _feudalism_ and establishing capitalist relations,
and the reactionary feudal social forces fighting to preserve
the decadent social system. Marx undertook the task of
revealing both the forces. In an article dated June 10, 1853,
Marx stated:

>I share not the opinion of those who believe
in a golden age of Hindustan. ... There cannot, however,
remain any doubt but that the misery inflicted by the British
on Hindustan is of an essentially different and infinitely more
intensive kind than all Hindustan had to suffer before.[^03/01]

[^03/01]: "The British Rule in India", in _The First Indian War of Independence_, 1857--59_, p. 15.

Comparing India with Italy, Marx wrote in the same
article

>Just as Italy has, from time to time, been compressed
by the conqueror's sword into different national masses,
so do we find Hindustan, when not under the pressure of the
_Mohammedan_, or the Mogul, or the Briton, dissolved into as
many independent and conflicting states as it numbered
towns, or even villages.[^03/02]

[^03/02]: _Ibid_, p. 14.

Marx has no regard at all for the Indian social life
which the ordinary nationalist proudly claims as "centuries
old". He even hates it. He is prepared to shed not a drop
of tear at its destruction. He remarks:

> ...We must not forget that these idyllic village communities,
inoffensive though they may appear, had always
been the solid foundation of Oriental despotism, that they
restrained the human mind within the smallest possible
compass, making it the unresisting tool of superstition,
enslaving it beneath the traditional rules, depriving it of
all grandeur and historical energies. We must not forget
that the barbarian egotism which, concentrating on some
miserable patch of land, had quietly witnessed the ruin of
empires, the perpetration of unspeakable cruelties, the
massacre of the population of large towns, with no other
consideration bestowed upon them than on natural events,
itself the helpless prey of any aggressor who deigned to
notice it at all. We must not forget that this undignified,
stagnatory, and vegetative life, that this passive sort of
existence evoked on the other part, in contradistinction,
wild, aimless, unbounded forces of destruction and rendered
murder itself a religious rite in Hindustan. We must
not forget that these little communities were contaminated
by distinctions of caste and by _slavery_, that they subjugated
man to external circumstances, instead of elevating
man to be the sovereign of circumstances, that they transformed
a self-developing social state into never changing
natural destiny, and thus brought about a brutalizing worship
of nature, exhibiting its degradation in the fact that
man, the sovereign of nature, fell down on his knees in
adoration of Hanuman, the monkey, and Sabala, the
cow.[^03/03]

[^03/03]: _Ibid_, pp. 20--21.

Marx's opinion about the British who destroyed such a
decadent, degenerate and old Indian society is this:

>England
has broken down the entire framework of Indian society,
without any symptoms of reconstitution yet appearing. This
loss of his old world, with no gain of a new one, imparts a
particular kind of melancholy to the present misery of the
Hindu, and separates Hindustan ruled by Britain from all its
ancient traditions, and from the whole of its past history.[^03/04]

On the question of the future of India, Marx wrote:

> All the English _bourgeois_ is may be forced to do will
neither emancipate nor materially mend the social condition
of the mass of the people. ... The Indians will not reap
the fruits of the new elements of society scattered among
them by the _industrial proletariat_, or till the Hindus themselves
shall have grown strong enough to throw off the
British yoke altogether.[^03/05]

[^03/04]: _Ibid_, p. 16.

[^03/05]: "The Future Results of the British Rule in India". _Ibid_, p. 38.

In brief, Marx recognized the historical truth that the
British functioned in India as the "instrument of history" to
cut at the roots of Indian social system which stood against
social progress for centuries. But he was not prepared to
compromise in any way with the inhuman aggression and
robbery committed by them on that pretext. Marx wrote:

>The profound hypocrisy and inherent barbarism of _bourgeois_
civilization lies unveiled before our eyes, turning from
its home, where it assumes respectable forms, to the colonies,
where it goes naked. They are the defenders of property.
But did any revolutionary party ever originate agrarian revolutions
like those in Bengal, in Madras, and in Bombay?
Did they not, in India, to borrow an expression of that great
robber, Lord Clive himself, resort to atrocious extortion,
when simple corruption could not keep pace with their rapacity?
While they prated in Europe about the inviolable
sanctity of national debt, did they not confiscate in India the
dividends of the _Rajas_, who had invested their private savings
in the company's own funds? While they combated the
French revolution under the pretext of defending "our holy
religion", did they not forbid, at the same time, Christianity
to be propagated in India, and did they not in order to
make money out of the pilgrims streaming to the temples of
Orissa and Bengal, take up the trade in the murder and
prostitution perpetrated in the temple of Juggernaut?[^03/06]

[^03/06]: _Ibid_, pp. 38--39.

It is clear that Marx and Engels gave India a new revolutionary
perspective that would prepare the ground for the
growth of democratic forces in the country by exposing the
nature of both the British domination and the feudal forces
that fought each other.

We rightly used to feel proud that India possessed a far
more ancient civilization as compared to the Europeans who
gradually established their domination over the country from
the sixteenth century. But the fact is that Indian civilization,
however ancient it might be, and its social life and economic
basis got completely destroyed with the arrival of the European
traders. Ordinary nationalists attribute this exclusively to
the use of force first by the foreign traders and then by the
foreign rulers in order to protect the interests of the former.
To say this would mean that a great and ancient civilization
was completely destroyed by the representatives of a relatively
inferior civilization.

This is contrary to the experience of history. There are,
of course, instances of people of inferior civilization conquering
countries of superior civilization in many parts of the
world. But in such instance, the victors were compelled to
adopt the civilization of the vanquished. The same thing
happened in the case of India also. Marx says:

>Arabs,
Turks, Tartars, Moguls, who had successively overrun India,
soon became Hinduized, the barbarian conquerors being, by
an eternal law of history, conquered themselves by the superior
civilization of their subjects.[^03/07]

[^03/07]: _Ibid_, p. 34.

This was altered only by the arrival of the foreign traders
who, unlike earlier conquerors, tried to destroy Indian
civilization. The process of this destruction reached its zenith
with the arrival of the most powerful among the European
capitalist countries, the British. Why? Because, as Marx
states:

>The British were the first conquerors superior, and,
therefore, inaccessible to Hindu civilization. They destroyed
it by breaking up the native communities, by uprooting the
native industry, and by levelling all that was great and elevated
in the native society.[^03/08]

[^03/08]: _Ibid_.

This does not, however, mean that the use of force had
no place in destroying Indian civilization. We come across
instances of large-scale use of brutal force by the British.
But what is more important than the use of force is the fact
that the Europeans represented a relatively more progressive
mode of production and production relations.

For several centuries, European countries were far behind
the Oriental countries like China, India, Iran and Egypt
in civilization. But by the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
there began to develop in Europe a new mode of production
and a corresponding production relation and also a new civilization
based on the new production relations leaving the
Oriental countries behind them. As illustrated in the _Communist
Manifesto_:

>The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened
>up fresh ground for the rising _bourgeoisie_. The EastIndian
>and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America,
>trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange
>and in commodities generally, gave to commerce,
>to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known,
>and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering
>feudal society, a rapid development.

And the results? The _Communist Manifesto_ continues:

>The _bourgeoisie_, wherever it has got the upper hand, has
>put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It
>has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound
>man to his "natural superiors", and has left remaining no
>other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest,
>than callous "cash payment". It has drowned the most
>heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm,
>of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of
>egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into
>exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible
>charted freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable
>freedom --- Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled
>by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked,
>shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.

The rise and development of capitalist society is the sum
total of these transformations, which affected all aspects of
human life. It was with the new life and inspiration that
resulted from these transformations that the European traders,
whom our ancestors ridiculed as "uncivilized", came
to India. As it happens so often in running races, the
Europeans who were trailing behind the hitherto advanced
countries like India, China, Iran and Egypt began to overtake
them in the race of progress of human society. The
process that helped the Europeans to achieve this progress
was the rise and development of _Capitalism_ which is so
masterly illustrated in the _Communist Manifesto_.

Why was India, which had remained in the forefront
for several centuries, pushed back at the stage of capitalist
development? Why were the Europeans, who hitherto were
trailing behind in the race of progress of human society, able
to overtake India and reach the forefront? Marx did not
have the relevant materials to find a clear answer to these
questions. So, he made no attempt to answer them.

Thanks to the efforts made by some investigators after
the life-time of Marx, some materials are now available
enabling us to answer these questions. Based on such materials,
the present author arrived at certain tentative conclusions:

1. The new mode of (agricultural) production developed by
   the invading Aryans broke up one by one the non-Aryan
   tribes. New societies emerged by the merging of different
   non-Aryan societies, on the one hand, and the non-Aryan
   and Aryan societies, on the other.
2. The productive capacity of the society as a whole
   increased as a result of the break-up of the tribal social
   system, as well as the progress in the mode of production.
   Consequently, the production activity became
   multifaceted, giving rise to a division of labour in the
   sense that a specific group of people became engaged in
   a specific type of occupation. As the productive capacity
   increased, all these factors together gave rise to a
   new production relation (_Chaturvarnya_) based on primitive
   form of exploitation. This turned into the caste system
   with greater complexity with the corresponding development
   of the mode of production and increased productive
   capacity.
3. There is no fundamental difference between the slave
   system that rose in ancient Greece, Rome and some West
   Asian countries and the _varna_-caste system that developed
   in India. The essential feature of both the
   system is the contradiction between the exploiters and
   the exploited. But there is one difference: in one system
   a large majority of the people were subjected to exploitation
   by openly declaring them slaves, whereas, in the
   other, the same thing was done in the guise of caste.
4. When the _varna_-caste system came into being, a special
   religious and ideological-philosophical framework was
   built up around the system of exploitation in order to
   maintain and justify the system. Thus, there formed
   in India a framework which was different from the religious
   and philosophical framework specific to exploitation
   in the form of the slave system. This is what
   appeared in the form of Hindu religion, Hindu philosophy
   and Hindu culture, which the Hindu communalists
   call the "Holy Indian Culture".
5. Although two different exploitative systems were
   prevalent in the West Asian countries and in India, there
   was one characteristic common to production in these
   regions in the ancient historical epoch. Generally
   speaking, the production process was for self-consumption.
   Only a small portion of the wealth produced was
   sold to others. Similarly, a small portion of the articles
   required for consumption was bought from others. In
   other words, the mode of production called "commodity
   production" was weak under both the systems.
6. The _varna_-caste system made the progress of commodity
   production slower than in the slave system. In
   India, the system give rise to the characteristic self-sufficient
   village system and the caste system as an
   integral part of it, under which the production of articles
   for local consumption was carried out by the local
   people themselves who were traditionally assigned
   specific occupations. Hence, the need for an exchange
   of articles across villages was reduced to the minimum.
7. Under _slavery_, on the other hand, the exploiting class
   had the motivation to sell the surplus appropriated from
   the slaves and lead a luxurious life with the money thus
   obtained. So, in the West Asian countries where the
   slave system existed, there was a more extensive exchange
   of commodities than in India with its self-sufficient
   village and caste systems. Therefore, it was necessary
   for the exploiting classes in those countries to plunder
   wealth which could be transformed into commodities.
   For this purpose they made large-scale incursions into
   India. The exploiting classes in India with self-sufficient
   villages could not resist these incursions and defeat
   the invaders.
8. None of these invaders could, however, destroy the
   foundation of the social system based on caste and self-sufficient
   villages. Even those who, taking inspiration
   from the dew Islamic religion, were out to conduct
   _jihad_ against non-Muslim religious believers could not
   destroy either the caste system or the self-sufficient
   villages. The result, however, was the formation of a
   'Muslim caste' side by side with the numerous castes
   among the Hindus.
9. In the area of production, however, the invasions
   helped to increase commodity production. But it did
   not spread to the whole of the society, for the articles
   that were bought and sold were luxury items in demand
   to satisfy the needs of the exploiting classes only,
   Similarly, as the exploiting classes began to appropriate
   more wealth corresponding to the increase in production
   the volume of goods sold in the market also increased.
   This increase in the exchange of commodities in the
   market, however, remained confined to the upper layer
   of society. At the lower level, commodity production
   and purchase of articles for consumption from the
   market remained extremely limited.
10. Excepting for a minority of the exploiting classes, the
    Indian social system continued to be one of self-sufficient
    villages which could not be destroyed by the invaders
    from West Asia. Nor could these invaders, emperors,
    and other military adventurers change the production
    relations in the rural areas and the social system based
    on them.
11. Here we see clearly the difference between this and
    the events after the arrival of the European merchants
    and the establishment of British power in the country.
    Unlike the foreign invaders from the _Vedic_ Aryans to
    the Mughals, the European traders came here with the
    seed of a social system which was foreign to India.
    They came here as the agents of the system of commodity
    production which cut at the very roots of 'Indian
    civilization' --- the systems of village self-sufficiency and
    castes.

They were not just the customary merchants who
bought here articles needed for maintaining the luxurious
life of the exploiting classes in their own countries, and sold
here a portion of the articles produced there. Rather, they
were the representatives of a new socio-economic system,
_Capitalism_, reaching every nook and corner of the world and
transforming the people everywhere into producers and consumers
for the world market. Having brought about an
all-pervading revolution in their own country, they came to
India, as they went elsewhere in the world, to fulfil the
mission of transforming everything into a commodity for
exchange. Neither the Hindu nor the Islamic form of
Indian civilization could survive it.

Thus, all the hitherto invaders who became the rulers
of India and who in the process became Indians themselves,
surrendered to the new (foreign) _Capitalism_. The last of the
'Indian' empires, the _Mughal Empire_, collapsed and a new
(British) empire, entirely foreign, began to emerge.

In sum, the "great ancientness" which helped India to
reach the forefront in the race of social progress upto a
stage, pushed the country to the background in the modern
era of the history of human society, in the era of _Capitalism_,
The "great ancientness" which once proudly produced wealth
became later a liability.

## THE CHANGES INTRODUCED BY THE BRITISH RULE: ITS DUAL CHARACTER

On the eve of the sixteenth century --- in 1498 --- Vasco De
Gama landed at Calicut. It was from then on that the domination
of _foreign Capitalism_, which culminated in the domination
by the British, began to take roots in India.

It was the Catholic monarchy of portugal that Vasco De
Gama represented. Before long, a group of traders from
Holland, a country of non-Catholics, came to India. Later
on, traders came from France and England. Keen competition
prevailed for nearly two centuries amongst the traders
from these four countries.

During this period the foreign traders had not turned
their attention to the sphere of internal trade (_i.e._ exchange
of commodities within the country). They confined themselves
to the purchase and exports of commodities that were
marketable in their own countries and to the import of
commodities for which there was a market in India. As such
the places of operation of the East India Company were
coastal areas. They had their headquarters in the port towns.

In the context of the political situation following the
decline of the _Mughal Empire_, the company needed a small
unit of military force for the maintenance and protection of
the trading centres; and they, therefore, organized such
security forces. But these forces did not move into the rural
areas in the interior for a period of over two centuries. Por
the limited purpose of protecting their trading interests they
adopted the tactics of co-operating with one or the other of
feudal chieftains. They had no intention, at that time, of
establishing their rule over this country.

It was in the middle of the eighteenth century that a
change in the situation came about. By that time, the Dutch
(Holland) had almost totally defeated the Portuguese. The
conflict between England and Holland had also ended in the
withdrawal of the British from Indonesia and of the Dutch
from India. Thus, only Britain and France remained in the
field of competition in India.

It was at a particular stage of this competition between
these two countries that the trading companies of these two
countries considered it necessary to have some hold over the
administration of the country, even for the protection of the
trading interests in which alone they had come to India
earlier. Thus, by the middle of the eighteenth century, an
intense struggle developed between them to protect their
trading interests and for getting some hold on the administration
of this country.

This struggle was not confined to India either; several
intensified battles and conflicts were taking place during this
period. At this time, a revolution took place in France,
smashing the antiquated social system. Following this, the
new French rulers unleashed another war in Europe, voicing
the message of the revolution. The misdeeds of the rulers
of France before the revolution and during the war following
the revolution had weakened France in relation to England,
both in Europe and in India. This resulted in a global defeat
for France.

Thus out of the four European countries which had
come to India from the beginning of the sixteenth century,
only England remained the ultimate victor. Only small
pockets like Pondicherry and Mahe remained in the possession
of France and Goa in the possession of Portugal.
Holland did not have any possession at all.

The _Battle of Plassey_ of 1757, in which the _Nawab_ of
Bengal, _Siraj-ud-Daula_, was defeated, was of crucial importance
in the history of the traders from England, which had
defeated the other three European powers through mutual
conflicts lasting nearly three centuries. "_Plassey_ started a
long chain of consequences which utterly changed the face
of India; the system of economy and government which had
lasted for centuries was transformed."[^03/09]

[^03/09]: Tara Chand, _History of the Freedom Movement in India_, New Delhi, Publications Division. Govt. of India, 1970, Vol I, p. 221.

Till then the British traders were also making obeisance,
like the Indian traders, to the Emperor at Delhi and to the
_Nawabs_ and other administrators subordinate to him, and
submissively waiting on them with respect and humility, for
favours and concessions. It was true they were using their
money-power and military strength in fights against some feudal lords with the connivance and assistance of some
others. But they were doing this while submitting totally to
the political supremacy of the Emperor and the administrators
under him.

A fundamental change came over this position with the
_Battle of Plassey_. They defeated the _Nawab_, _Siraj-ud-Daula_,
who was the foremost and the strongest among the subordinates
of the Emperor, and put in his place a new _Nawab_
(Mir Jaffar) who was so subservient to the foreign power as
to become the synonym for treachery and sedition. Thus,
the British became the _de facto_ controlling power in an area
which was of strategic importance.

Developments took place at a quick pace. In 1764 the
_Mughal Emperor_ himself granted the _Diwani_ to the British
Company empowering them the rule over the provinces of
Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. Thus, the English East India Company
became the direct controlling authority over a large
territory, instead of ruling through Mir Jaffer. Subsequently,
the British defeated the _Nizam_ and the _Sultan_ of Mysore
in South India, the _Marathas_ in Western India, and the
feudal lords in areas which now form part of Uttar Pradesh
and in Punjab (now divided, one part going to Pakistan)
and in Sind, now part of Pakistan. Thus:

>Within a hundred years from _Plassey_ the whole of India
had been forced to accept the British yoke. It was, from
the military point of view, a curious achievement. For in
all the battles fought the fighters were predominantly Indians.
The composition of the army of an Indian chief was
not very different from that of the East India Company.
The Indian chief's army consisted of a small contingent of
European soldiers led by European officers, especially in
the artillery arm, a quota of varying strength of European-trained
Indian infantry, and a large number of Indian horse
and foot fighting according to traditional ways. The army
of the Company consisted of a contingent of European
soldiers and an Indian infantry force trained by Europeans;
the third element, the untrained trooper, was absent or formed
an unimportant auxiliary force. Thus, the forces of
the Indian princes, under the command of European and
Indian officers fought against the company's forces consisting
of European and Indian soldiers under European and
Indian commanders.[^03/010]

[^03/010]: _Ibid_, p. 231.

It is needless to say that the army of the East India
Company was also similarly constituted.

The British subdued India not in a single battle of the
normal type. They utilised the services of a section of the
Indian chiefs, including their army, and subjugated the Indian
feudal chiefs, one by one, to the position of mere subordinates.
They used various tactics to suit this purpose. Battles
with their attendant merciless cruelty, diplomatic actions and
the _resultant_ friendly relations, policies and approaches
adopted to suit the exigencies of the situation in order to
establish their authority --- all these tactics were skillfully
employed to subjugate India.

It is needless to recount the reasons for their success in
this regard. The Indian chiefs were the representatives of a
social system which had remained stunted for centuries. The
foreign traders, on the other hand, represented a rapidly
developing social system. In the conflict between the representatives
of the declining and developing social systems, the
representatives of the latter emerged victorious.

The changes that followed this victory possessed a dual
character. A decadent social system faces all-round destruction
following the military defeat of the representatives of
that system. And that destruction eventually becomes complete.
But in this case, the new foreign rulers did not want a
complete destruction of the old --- they wanted victory only on
the military front --- for they knew that the development of
_Capitalism_ in India as it did in England would be a threat to
their interest. That was why Marx stated that:

>The Indians
will not reap the fruits of the new elements of society scattered
among them by the British _bourgeoisie_ till in Great Britain
itself the new ruling classes shall have been supplanted
by the _industrial proletariat_, or till the Hindus themselves
shall have grown strong enough to throw off the English yoke
altogether.[^03/011]

[^03/011]: _First Indian War of Independence_, p. 38.

It is this dual character of the social revolution that took
place in India, following the establishment of British rule
over this country, that paved the way for the struggle for
India's national independence. It was again this dual character
of the social revolution that gave rise to two types of
freedom movement in India --- that of 1857, and the other
that began after the 1857--59 struggle. Before going into the
details of these movements, let us examine the character of
this social revolution, how it manifested itself, and its impact
on various spheres of social life.

We have seen that the _Battle of Plassey_ of 1757 was the
turning point in the evolution of British rule in India. From
that time onwards, virtually, and from 1764, the year in
which the _Diwani_ was obtained from the Emperor at Delhi,
formally, the English East India Company became the actual
rulers of India. This had its impact on the entire social
system.

As we know, the social and administrative set-up prevailing
in India prior to the advent of the foreign traders consisted
of a hierarchy with more or less self-sufficient village
communities with local _self-government_ at the bottom, _i.e._,
the level of the villages, feudal chieftains, with limited responsibilities
of tax collection and rendering help during wars,
occupying an intermediate position, and the prince or the
Emperor at the top. This set-up and the social and administrative
system evolved with the development of _Capitalism_ in
England were poles apart in character. Consequently, there
was an unbridgeable gap and contradiction between the legal
enactments, rules and procedures and the consciousness and
conception developed as a consequence in the minds of
the people under these two systems. When the conflict between
the two differing systems was beginning to develop, the
_Diwani_ granted by the _Mughal emperor_ to the English East
India Company in 1764, in fact, facilitated the domination
by one over the other, that is, the domination of a system
imported from a foreign land over the one which had remained
relatively unchanged for several centuries.

On obtaining powers under the _Diwani_ the English
Company began to introduce in Bengal, and subsequently in
areas where they acquired administrative powers, such reforms
as would destroy the entire system in existence for
centuries, including village life, the domination of feudal and
caste-communal forces over it, the agricultural and industrial
structure and the juridical system. And after the
administrative power was transferred from the Company to
the British Crown, this process continued in a more planned
manner.

Under the rule of _Mughal Emperors_ land relations had
reached a relatively developed form in India, although the
system was not working uniformly throughout the country.
But there was one element common to all the variants of this
system. And this common element was that no attempt was
made by the administrative authorities to establish ownership
rights on land or even to seriously interfere with the rights
of those who were in possession of land. They confined
themselves to collecting land revenue at the prescribed rates.
The landlords who were emerging in the feudal system also
confined themselves to collecting rent from the occupants,
and did not interfere much with the rights and privileges of
the possessors of land. The dues payable to both the landlords
or to the administrative authorities were also fixed
according to convention. This system was in existence for
some centuries.

However, the new rulers (East India Company) tried to
replicate the conceptions and laws regarding land ownership
which were prevailing in their own country. Accordingly,
one section of the new rulers began to function on the basis
of the concept that the ownership rights rested solely with
the king or the ruler. Another section, on the other hand,
adhered to the theory that there must be a landlord in between
the ruler and the actual possessors of land. Efforts
were made to interpret the land ownership system in accordance
with the concepts held by the respective sections of
the rulers. Consequently, three land ownership systems
--- _Zamindari_, _Ryotwari_ and _Mahalwari_ --- with several variants
came into existence in different parts of the country.

Despite variations, all these systems are equally exploitative
and pauperize the possessor of land. Under the
_Zamindari_ system, the landlord, who was liable to remit a
prescribed amount to the government, could collect as much
as he wished from those in possession of the land. Under
the other two systems the Government directly collects the
tax from the possessors of land at rates fixed on an increasing
scale. The ultimate result of both types of collection is
the increasing burden on the cultivating peasants.

For instance, in the _Madras Presidency_, under the
_Ryotwari_ system, the land revenue collected in the year 1810--11 was £10,00,000. By 1825--26 the amount had increased
to £40,00,000. In Bombay, the revenue collected was
£8,00,000 in 1817, rising to £11,50,000 the next year and
to £18,60,000 by the year 1837--38.

As mentioned earlier, it was in Bengal that the English
Company had secured ruling power for the first time. There
the Company introduced the _Zamindari_ system. The agents
of the _Mughal Emperor_ collected in 1764--65 £8,18,000
which rose to £14,70,000 in 1765--66 and to £28,60,000 in 1790--91.

Not only the amounts collected directly by the Government
as tax or as rent through landlords but also the laws
enacted for this purpose disrupted the rural economy of
India. The theory that each piece of land must have an
owner --- either the ruler or the landlord, or alternatively, the
possessor --- was basic to the laws of land relations enacted
by the foreign rulers. This was an anathema to the traditional
Indian concepts and the consciousness of the people.
The core of the old Indian village system was that although
the possessors of land, the landlord, the feudal chief and
the ruler, had certain rights of their own, none of them had
an unlimited right.

When the English concept of land ownership was brought
into practice in India, the owner, whether it be the
_Zamindar_, or the landowner created by a legal enactment or
the possessor of the land could mortgage or sell his right on
the land. The land of the possessor could now be seized for
default in payment of rent due to the landlord or the taxes
due to the government, As a consequence, landowners and
those in possession of land fell into the grip of a new section,
the money-lender. According to Captain Wingate, the then
Revenue Survey Commissioner in the Bombay Province:

>A set of low usurers is fast springing up, by who, small
sums are lent for short period at enormous rates of interest
to the very lowest of the population who have not credit
enough to obtain advances from the more respectable of
village bankers.[^03/012]

[^03/012]: From the report of Capt. Wingate quoted by Tarachand, _op. cit_, p. 299.

Thus, the landlords and the usurers, the two sections
that emerged as a consequence of the land reform measures
introduced by the English Company, joined together to loot
the vast majority of peasants and other sections of the rural
poor. And the practice of paying a major share of the loot
to the English Company also came into vogue. Alongside
these, handicrafts and the foreign trade based on these
crafts, which had been extant for centuries in India, declined
gradually. For instance, Indian textiles exported in 1795--96
amounted to Rs. 21,22,319.5. In 1829--30, the value of textiles
exported fell to Rs. 6,95,725. On the other side, the
value of goods imported to India from England in 1814 was
£18,00,000. The value of imports rose to £45,00,000 in 1829. Thus, while the foreign market for goods produced
by handicrafts-men in India declined, the market for foreign
goods expanded.

The pauperization of the rural people as a result of the
land reforms introduced by the Company and the decline in
the trading and industrial sectors ruined both the villages
and urban areas alike. It will not be an exaggeration to say
that it was this decline and the ruin of the Indian people
that accelerated the development of _Capitalism_ in England.
English political commentators themselves have accepted
this fact.

>In England, too, the agrarian revolution had thrown
labourer out of land and increased unemployment, causing
great misery and hardship. But the Industrial Revolution
which followed soon absorbed the unemployed labourers in
the newly established manufacturing industries, so that the
period of unemployment and hardship was short. In India,
on the other hand, labour was released from industry but
there was no comparable development of industries or extension
of agriculture to absorb that labour. ... In India the
human suffering caused by the social revolution was incalculably
greater and much more prolonged.[^03/013]

[^03/013]: Tara Chand, _Ibid_, pp. 335--386.

A question may be raised as to why the people of India
were prepared to submit meekly to the situation, undergoing
sufferings and misery resulting from it, and why they did
not rise in revolt against British domination.

As will be seen in the following chapters, the people of
India did, in fact, rise in revolt on several occasions against
British domination, and in many cases these revolts assumed
the form of armed insurrections. Revolts had burst out at
various stages in various forms from one end of the country
to the other. And these revolts date back to the very beginning
of British domination.

None of these revolts was, however, as widespread as
the struggle of 1857. Nor were they centred around the centre
of power located in Delhi, considered the traditional capital
of Indian rulers. These revolts were, on the other hand,
isolated struggles carried on at places far away from Delhi
and confined to relatively small areas. And each one of these
struggles was suppressed as was the revolt of 1857. Why did
it happen?

The answer is simple. Traders had come to India even
earlier from West Asia and a few even from Europe and the
eastern countries like China. While carrying on their trading
activities, they were also participating at the same time in the
socio-cultural life of this country. In the process they identified
themselves with the life of this country. Many of them
settled down in India and subsequently became Indians.

The people of India regarded the European trading companies
located in the port towns and the persons working in
these companies in the same way as they did the traders
who had come to India earlier. They believed that these
traders, like their predecessors, would gradually become
'Indians' or at least maintain friendly relations with the
people of the country.

Two and a half centuries after the landing of Vasco da
Gama at Calicut, when the European powers, including the
British and the French began to engage themselves in intense
conflicts with each other in the middle of the 18th century
for domination, Clive of England and Dupleix of France
came to India as representatives of the trading companies
of their respective countries. With their arrival the character
of the trading companies which they represented changed
completely. In their efforts to beat each other they began to
exert influence on the local elites and gain control over the
administrative machinery through them. The _Battle of
Plassey_ represents an important stage in the victory which
England was able to win in this regard.

It must also be understood that the situation that developed
in India following the decline of the _Mughal Empire_
provided a fertile ground not only for the conflicts between
England and France but also for the earlier conflicts between
Portugal and Holland, and between these two countries
on the one hand and France on the other.

After Aurangazeb, no _Mughal Emperor_ possessed anything
more than the title. The _Nawabs_, princes and military
chieftains under these emperors were functioning as _de
facto_ rulers. There were also areas which were not even
formally part of the _Mughal Empire_. What prevailed in
India at the time was the dominance of provincial rulers and
feudal chieftains who were, formally or otherwise, independent
of the _Mughal Emperors_ of Delhi. Each one of these
provincial rulers was trying to extend his authority to wider
areas, and to curb the feudal chieftains in the areas under
his control. Such conflicts amongst the local rulers were
an integral part of the political situation prevailing in India
at that time. For instance, three princes in Kerala --- the
Zamorin of Calicut, the _Maharaja_ of Cochin and the _Maharaja_
of Travancore --- emerged as powerful rulers after
defeating in war several feudal chieftains. And it was in
those circumstances that Vasco da Gama landed in Calicut.
For two centuries thereafter, foreign trading companies
first, the Portuguese, and then the Dutch, and following them
the British and French tried to establish their trading supremacy
by alternately fraternizing and opposing this or that
ruler. The three rulers, on the other hand, utilized the
armed might of these European trading companies which
had maintained small naval forces originally to protect their
trade in order to extend their respective territories. The
same thing happened all over India. It became the practice
of those wielding power to seek the assistance of the
European trading companies for settling mutual conflicts as
also to solve disputes over succession within the ruling families.

Ruling families, feudal lords and the local chieftains,
however important they were in the social life of the time,
were not the only sections that constituted the elite of that
period. A class of traders was also emerging in India, although
at a pace slower than in the European countries. Groups of
people engaged in transporting and exchanging goods from
one end of the country to the other had come to be formed
in India. Many of them were so wealthy that they lent
money oven to the emperors and the princes.

In other words, social forces of _Capitalism_ were developing
within the medieval Indian society, although at a slower
pace than in the European countries. Trading was carried on
by these groups in collaboration with the European trading
companies. And in the process, the Indian commercial class
also made profits, as did the European trading companies.

All these sections, namely, the former rulers, feudal
lords, local chieftains and such others, as also those engaged
in trade and industry, were interested in the functioning and
development of the European trading companies. The European
trading companies, on the other hand, tried to carry on
trade without jeopardizing the interests of those sections.
The British who gained ultimate victory over other European
traders also continued this policy for some years even after
consolidating their position. The period extending up to the
middle of the 19th century witnessed a sense of co-operation
between the British rulers and the newly affluent classes
consisting of landlords, traders and usurers. But this
co-operation did not last long.

The Indian elite of those days did not realize that there
was a special feature which distinguished these foreign
traders from those who had come earlier in India's history.
Hence, they did not consider it in any way harmful or detrimental
to their interests to enter into economic contracts or
even military pacts with these traders.

The Indian elite did not realize at that time that France
and England had adopted, by the middle of the 18th century,
an approach different from that followed hitherto by the
European companies, which, if put into practice, would deprive
the elite class of India of its own ruling power. They had
only the blinkered view of getting the help of the European
companies for attaining their temporary selfish aims.

We have already noted briefly the developments which
followed the victory of the British in the _Battle of Plassey_,
namely, their taking over control of the administration in
Bengal, Bihar and Orissa by securing the _Diwani_ from the
Emperor in Delhi, the land reforms measures implemented
by them, and the decline of industry and trade in India as a
consequence of the economic policies pursued by the British
Government in England and by the new British rulers in
India. The ruinous changes that were brought about in the
sphere of economy did not leave the ruling classes alone.

In fact, the changes that were brought about in the
system of land ownership following the grant of the _Diwani_
in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa and later on in all other areas
which were brought under the domination of the British,
had their impact in the administrative and educational spheres
and in all sectors of the socio-cultural life of the country.
Axe fell on the very roots of the _Gram Panchayats_ and other
local self-governing bodies, of caste-communal organizations,
and not merely on the establishment, the Emperor and other
rulers, the feudal lords and the provincial chieftains. It was
such a transformation that the British rulers brought about
when they altered the system of revenue administration.

>The change was enormous which it was the nature of
this decree (relating to the decision of the Court of Directors
of the Company that its servants should take upon
themselves the entire care and management of the revenues --- EMS)
to produce. It was a revolution much greater,
probably, than any previous conjecture --- than even the
change from Hindu to _Mohammedan_ masters, had been
able to create. The transition from Hindu to _Mohammedan_
masters had only changed the hands by which the
sword was wielded, and favours were dispensed; the
machine of the Government, still more the texture of the
society, underwent feeble alterations, and the civil part of
the administration was, from conveniency, left almost
wholly in the hands of the Hindus. A total change in the
management of the revenues more deeply affected the
condition, individually and collectively, of the people of
India than it is easy for the European reader to conceive.
It was an innovation by which the whole property of the
country, and along with it the administration of justice,
were placed upon a new foundation.[^03/16]

[^03/16]: JaMes Mill, quoted by Tara Chand, _Ibid_, pp. 243--244.

The revenue department which was primarily responsible
for the collection of taxes became the main instrument of
general administration. The revenue department, from the
District Collector down to the village officer, controlled by
the rulers at the centre and provinces smashed the foundation
of the traditional administrative system which continued till
then. No longer did the village _Panchayats_ and other local
self-governing bodies, as also the local chiefs and feudal
lords who were supervising the functioning of these bodies
and taking a share of their income, find any place in the
administrative set-up. Instead, there was now a steel frame
which lay extended from the village staff at the bottom to
the Governor-General at the top.

The former elite classes, however, continued to enjoy
their old position and status of landlords and the income
derived therefrom, or _malikhan_. A small section of these
elites also obtained ruling powers as princes under the
suzerainty of the British as long as they remained loyal to the
new rulers. But none of them had any real or visible share
in the administration.

The moves towards evolving and consolidating this new
administrative set-up were gradual. In 1773, 1783, 1813, 1833, and 1853, each year, either an "India Act" was enacted
in the British Parliament or the administrative system
was reorganized in some other manner. At each stage the
role of the British Government enhanced. The foundation
of the former rulers and their subordinates, the feudal landlords
and of the socio-cultural life that was the basis of their
administrative functioning, was eroded in proportion to the
increase in the role of the British Government.

Many revolts erupted in several parts of the country
towards the end of the 18th century and the beginning of
the 19th. Not only was each of these revolts suppressed,
but the feudal lords who remained in power in Delhi, which
was India's centre of administration in the ancient and medieval
periods, and in surrounding areas were also subjugated.
It was with this development that the true colours of the new
(foreign) rulers were revealed to both the elite classes and
the common people throughout Northern India. It was the
outburst of the dissatisfaction that arose out of this situation
that was witnessed in the struggle for independence in 1857--59. Tara Chand describes the situation on the eve of
this outburst in the following words:

>A deadly pall hung
over India, under which the classes were smothered and the
masses breathed with difficulty. The Muslim and Hindu
ruling princes were disarmed and isolated; the Muslim and
Hindu families, tribes and castes which had provided soldiers,
administrators and leaders, were ostracised from offices
of responsibility and condemned to serve as helots; the
Muslim and Hindu learned classes were deprived of patronage
and slowly squeezed out of their avocations.[^03/17]

[^03/17]: Tara Chand, _Ibid_, p. 289.

In the background of the resultant discontent of the
elite class was the miserable life of two sections of the people --- the
artisans and urban poor, on the one hand, and the
pauperized peasants and the rural poor, on the other.
