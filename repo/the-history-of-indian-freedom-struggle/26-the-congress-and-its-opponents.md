# THE CONGRESS AND ITS OPPONENTS

## THE _INDIAN NATIONAL ARMY_

By the time Jayaprakash Narayan and other Socialist leaders
started functioning as an underground centre of the _AICC_,
the struggle had already become scattered. The centre in a
statement issued in November 1949 said that "our ranks
have been repleted; our resources, in the form of local assistance
in rural areas, and active enthusiastic support from
village youngmen have been reduced by repression". In spite
of this, the leaders of the underground organization firmly
believed that the Indian masses were solidly with them. So
they chartered a programme of action to make the struggle
more wide-spread and more democratic. The programme
included the following items.

>1. The peasantry should refuse to pay the land tax
>and obstruct the revenue and police officers to collect the
>tax. Even a military invasion should be rendered ineffective
>by flight into the jungles.
>2. Non-sale of food-crops and cattle.
>3. Non-acceptance of paper money.
>4. Emphasising upon the people the danger of food and
>cloth famine.
>5. Organization of _Swaraj Panchayat_ and boycotting
>of revenue or police officers.
>6. Roads, and telegraphs and railways to be destroyed
>to defeat the British military.[^26/1]

[^26/1]: R. C Majumdar, _History and Culture of the Indian People_, Vol. II, Bombay,
Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1969. p. 657.

But the programme remained only on the paper. This
was not because the people were loyal to the British, or they
were opposed to the _Quit India Struggle_, but because the
government had succeeded in suppressing with arms all
demonstrations of protest during the one and a half months
following 9th August. A general feeling spread among the
people that it was futile to fight the British.

However, while the struggle within India was being
suppressed, certain developments were taking place outside
the country, which culminated in the formation of the _Indian
National Army_, its attempts to enter India under the leadership
of Subhas Bose and its final defeat.

When Subhas Bose left India secretly in January 1941,
Japan was not a party in the Second World War. Germany
was making preparation to attack the Soviet Union under
the cover of the _no-war pact_ it had signed with it. Hitler
was waiting for an opportunity to attack Britain and the
countries under its possession after defeating the _Allied
forces_ in Europe. Therefore, Bose first went to Germany
where he established relation with the German Foreign Minister
Ribbentrop and the fascist rulers of Italy, and started making
regularly _anti-British_ propaganda on the German radio.
This evoked two different reactions among the politically
conscious people in India. Among those who had adopted
an _anti-fascist_ outlook, thanks to the systematic propaganda
carried out by _anti-fascist_ organizations in India including
the Congress, Bose's activities evoked opposition. They
were disturbed by his friendship with the fascist forces. At
the same time, another section expressed sympathy with his
activities. Their hatred towards the British rulers was
stronger than that towards the fascist forces.

The entire course of the war changed before long. During
the initial months when the German forces made rapid
advances, a general impression was created that the Soviet
Union would be defeated in the war. On the Asian front,
Japan began to make advances. This too helped to create
two reactions. It created sympathy towards the Soviet Union
and China and hatred towards Germany and Japan. The
second reaction was the feeling that Germany and Japan together
were crushing the British and India could utilize this
opportunity to win freedom. Both these reactions were found
reflected on the people at large and particularly among the
ranks and leadership of the Congress.

The Congress leadership participated in the talks with
Cripps as a compromise between these two outlooks. At
this stage, the sympathy towards the Soviet Union and
China bore more weight with the leadership. But as the
talks broke down, the joy over the advances being made by
Germany and Japan as well as the feeling that India would
be able to take advantage of the situation and gain freedom
became stronger. Even in the midst of their talks with Cripps,
the Congress leadership had maintained that in spite of
their sympathy to the _Allied powers_, they would not be able
to participate in the war efforts of the British as long as they
continued to hang on to power in India. Even in the _Quit
India Resolution_, the Congress reiterated its sympathy to the
Allies.

While this was the situation within the country, among
the Indian living abroad there was a wide-spread feeling of
admiration for Germany and Japan in their victory in the
war and the optimism that India would be able to utilize the
new world situation and gain independence. Even those
living in countries occupied by Germany and Japan, who had
_anti-fascist_ feelings, did not express them. Thus, Berlin
and Tokyo became the centres of the Indians who were eager
to wage an _anti-British_ struggle. Berlin was the main centre
of such activities until Japan declared war on the United
States and Britain. With Japan's entry in the war and its
triumphant march over many Asian countries, the centre was
shifted to Tokyo.

Rash Behari Bose, an Indian revolutionary who had left
India during the First World War was living in Japan as a
Japanese citizen. On his initiative, a conference of Indians
was held in Tokyo from 28th to 30th March 1942, which
formed the _Indian Independence League_ of the overseas
Indians. Following, a larger conference was held in Bangkok
from 15th to 23rd June in which 100 delegates representing
Indians living in East and South-East Asia participated. Rash
Behari Bose was elected president of the _Indian Independence
League_. The conference hoisted the Indian tri-colour flag
and declared the immediate attainment of complete freedom
for India its objective.

The Conference through a resolution invited Subhas
Chandra Bose, who was then living in Germany, 10 Asia.
Accepting the invitation, Subhas Bose reached Tokyo in
June 1943 and took over the presidentship of the _Indian
Independence League_ from Rash Behari Bose.

Meanwhile, in December 1941 Japan invaded Malaya
and defeated the British forces there. A number of soldiers
were taken prisoners of war. A small party of Indian soldiers
led by Capt. Sohan Singh who escaped from the advancing
Japanese forces surrendered finally after wandering in
the forest for a few days. The Japanese officers held talks
with Sohan Singh and suggested to him to form an "_Indian
National Army_" out of a selected number of Indian prisoners
of war and march to India in cooperation with the Japanese
forces to end the British rule there. Sohan Sing accepted
the suggestion. This was how the _Indian National Army_
(_INA_) was formed with Indian prisoners of war. In accordance
with the decision of the Bangkok conference, a
_Council of Action_ was set up with Rash Behari Bose as the
president and Sohan Singh as the minister of defence and
the Commander-in-Chief of the Army. However, the activities
of the Council were hampered for several reasons, and
it was only after Bose arrived and took up the leadership
that they could be carried out smoothly.

As Subhas Bose took over the leadership of both the
_Council_ and the _Indian National Army_, a new wave of enthusiasm
swept over the Indians in the Japanese occupied
countries and even over a section of nationalists in India.
It may be noted that after his taking over the leadership,
the name of the Council was changed to "_Provisional
Government_" on 21st October 1943. The feeling became
wide-spread among the nationalists in India and abroad that
the _INA_ and _Provisional Government_ were safe under the
leadership which was capable both of liberating India from
the British rule with the assistance of Japan and of preventing
Japan from establishing its domination on the country thus
liberated. It was also widely believed that the _anti-British_
underground movement led by Jayaprakash and other Socialist
leaders was going to achieve final victory with the offensive
actions of the _INA_ forces led by Bose.

The initial activities of the _INA_ were such as to create
this impression. Bose was determined to maintain independence
of the _INA_ and the _Provisional Government_ from the
Japanese government and its military bosses. A number of
biographical notes and reminiscences contained instances of
Bose having taken strong position against the actions of the
Japanese government which were not in correspondence with
his ideas.

The consciousness spread among the _INA_ men that
far from being the mercenaries of Japanese masters, they
were rising as the national army of India. In addition to the
former prisoners of war, a section of the civilians trained by
them also became an integral part of the _INA_. This enlarged
_INA_ with Bose as its supreme commander fought and marched
ahead. More than 4,000 among them were killed in actions, and finally they were able to set foot on the Indian soil in
March 1944. The Japanese ruler Tojo declared that Japan
was resolved to extend all means in order to help to expel
and eliminate from India "the Anglo-Saxon influence" and
enable India to achieve "_full independence_ in the true sense
of the term".

But by the time they were able to reach about 150 miles
inside the eastern borders of India, the course of the war
began to change. The _INA_'s first target was Imphal. However,
they could not achieve the objective because the Japanese
failed to reach the necessary supplies and materials. Meanwhile,
the monsoon set in preventing their further advance.
The British, on the other hand, used the opportunity to
regroup their forces and made a successful counter-attack
on the Japanese and _INA_ forces as the monsoon withdrew.
This marked the beginning of the end of the Japanese army
and the _INA_.

Thus, both the _Quit India_ movement inside India and
the _INA_ offensive outside India aborted. The British were
able to suppress the _Quit India Struggle_ using its police and
military forces. They were also able to defeat Japan and
recover Burma, Malaya and Singapore with the support of
the _anti-fascist_ forces all over the world and with the military
aid and cooperation from the Allies including the Soviet
Union and the United States.

But the _Quit India Struggle_ and the activities of the _INA_
had shaken the foundation of the British rule in India. The
former remained in a subdued state ready to erupt at the
first opportunity. The experience with the _INA_ provided the
warning that even the Indian soldiers who had been regarded
as mercenaries of the British might turn the direction of their
guns at an appropriate movement. When the _INA trial_ began
in the court, the ire of the people including that of the Indian
servicemen rose high. The country-wide protest against the
trail clearly showed that if the British were to hang on to
power arrogantly with the claim that they were successful in
suppressing both the movements, not only the people of
India in general but even the armed forces under the British
control would rise against them. This was confirmed by the
mutiny organized subsequently by the naval ratings in Bombay.

It was under these circumstances that the British decided
to re-start negotiations. Details of these negotiations will be
given in the latter chapters. However, it is necessary here
to find an answer to the questions why did the '_August
revolution_' fail and why did the _INA_ crumble after registering
partial success in the initial stage.

1. The _Quit India Struggle_ was not built upon the
   organized strength of the masses, no matter how wide a
   support it had received. It was the same leadership which
   had been arguing that any mass struggle was contrary to the
   principle of _non-violence_ that now called upon the people
   to adopt any method each of them considered appropriate in
   the _Quit India Struggle_. Even this call was subject to the
   principle of _non-violence_! Therefore, as Jayaprakash and
   others pointed out later, the absence of an organization
   strong enough to wage the struggle disarmed the people.
2. The _Quit India Struggle_ failed to create even a ripple
   among the armed forces maintained by the British. Like their
   English counterparts, the Indian soldiers continued to act in
   accordance with the orders given by their superiors. There
   was not one minor incidence of insubordination anywhere
   in India during the 1942 struggle as was witnessed in
   Peshawar during the 1930 _salt satyagraha_. Mutiny in the organized
   armed force is an important element in the success of
   any revolution. As Lenin stated, without immobilizing the
   armed forces no major revolution had succeeded and will not
   succeed.
3. The _INA_ was the first indication to the fact that the
   British Indian armed forces would not act as loyally as
   before. What made the _INA_ a strong-willed military force
   was the fact that a section of the Indian army turned against
   the British and thousands of civilians turned themselves
   into trained soldiers under such a popular leader like Subhas
   Bose.
4. Even at that stage, the Indian soldiers who were
   deployed against the _INA_ were acting loyally to the British
   rulers. Neither the organizers of the _Quit India_ movement nor
   the _INA_ was able to "immobilize" it. Added to this was
   the fact that in Europe in the west and in Asia in the east,
   the fascist powers were facing one defeat after another.
   All this led to the final defeat of the _INA_.

## AUGUST STRUGGLE AND THE _COMMUNIST PARTY_

In the midst of the people who were excited by the
politics of the _Quit India Struggle_ and the formation of
_INA_, the _Communist Party_ was growing as a new political
force in the country. From 1933--34 when a perpetually functioning
central leadership of the Party emerged, the
_Communist Party_ had been striving to unite the left forces
within and outside the Congress and to draw the Congress
along the path of an uncompromising struggle against the
British. Thus, the party was functioning as part of a leftist
united front in which the top Congress leaders like Jawaharlal
Nehru and Subhas Bose had played important roles.

As the war broke out, the _left front_ broke up and the
constituents of the front --- the _Communist Party_, the _Congress
Socialist Party_ and the _Forward Bloc_ --- began to proceed
along their respective ways. The Congress came under
the leadership of Gandhi, though deviating at times from
his path. The _Communist Party_ which was fighting against
the compromising policy being pursued by Gandhi and the
Congress, could eaam the appreciation of the _anti-imperialist_
circles in the country.

The situation changed once again in the second stage of
the war when Germany attacked the Soviet Union and Japan
overran the Asian countries and reached the eastern frontier
of India. People's indignation rose high against the British
rulers who were utilizing the economic and manpower resources
of India to protect their own imperialist interests
without conceding to India its right to independence. The
_anti-fascist_ attitude the Congress had hitherto been maintaining
got weakened. Not only Bose who, camping at Berlin,
Bangkok and other places, was cooperating with the fascist
forces, but also the Congress leaders in India began to take
an attitude which was in effect favourable to Japan on the
belief that "Japan would not attack India". Statements and
speeches contrary to the _anti-fascist_ policy and approach
that the Congress had been pursuing for a decade came in
abundance form leaders like Gandhi. Other Congress leaders
like Nehru and Azad who were disturbed by this new trend,
however, succumbed to the pressure of popular sentiments
and helplessly supported the _Quit India Resolution_.

As we have seen earlier, the only section in the Congress
which had uncompromisingly opposed this was the Communists.
The _Communist Party_ did not give in even after the
adoption of the _Quit India Resolution_ by the _AICC_. The
Party continued to hold that it was suicidal to launch the
_Quit India Struggle_ in a manner that would obstruct the war
efforts of the _Allied Powers_ including the Soviet Union in
the prevailing world situation in which the very future of the
Soviet Union was hanging in the balance and a large part
of Asia including the eastern border countries of India came
under Japanese occupation. It could not agree with the views
of Bose of liberating India with the assistance of Japan. So
the _Communist Party_ kept itself aloof from the _Quit India
Struggle_ as well as from the activities of the _INA_. Not only
that, the Party did not hesitate to organize campaigns among
the People that the activities on these lines were suicidal.

For the Party it was a period of great trial. It was
placed itself in a situation in which it had not only to challenge
the _bourgeois_ leadership of the Congress but had to
move against the current of _anti-imperialist_ feelings which
had become strong among all classes and sections of the
people. Furthermore, immediately before launching their
attack against the Congress, the authorities released many
well-known Communist leaders from the prison and withdrew
arrest warrants issued against many others who had escaped
arrest. This had helped to create an impression among a large
section of the people who had participated in the _Quit India
Struggle_ or who were otherwise sympathetic towards the
struggle that "the Communists had struck a deal with the
British".

This was the circumstance under which the Communists
came to be alienated from the people including those who had
regarded them highly for the part they had played earlier
in the _anti-imperialist_ struggles. Later, this was also utilized
by Nehru and other top Congress leaders in making fierce
propaganda against the Communists who, according to them,
"joined the other side during the independence struggle".

However, judging the activities of the Communists
before 1942 and after 1945, no one would think that they
would do anything that would help the British rulers in
suppressing the freedom movement. Hence, it is necessary
to examine objectively what the Communists did in the
period 1942--45.

It was true that the Communist did not take part in the
_Quit India Struggle_ called for by the Congress. It was also
true that at the end of the first stage of the struggle when
subversive activities were organized by the Congress functioning
underground under the leadership of Jayaprakash
Narayan and others, the Party mobilized all its resources to
campaign extensively among the people that the policy they
were pursuing was suicidal. Further, the opposition put up
by the Party against the approach of Bose of liberating
India with the assistance of Japan helped to spread bitterness
towards the Party amongst other _anti-imperialist_ forces in
the country. But the truth was that the Party adopted this
attitude on the basis of the _anti-fascist_ policies which had
been consistently followed by all _anti-imperialist_ forces in
the country and officially adopted by the Congress itself.

The 1942 _Quit India Resolution_ and all other official
documents and declarations of the Congress had expressed the
determination of the Congress not to do anything that would
impede the _anti-fascist_ war efforts of the _Allied Powers_
which included Britain. We have also noted that Nehru and
Azad amongst the top Congress leaders who had subscribed
to this view more strongly could not really agree to Gandhi's
policy with regard to the _Quit India Struggle_. Their dissent
was in essence the policy which was adopted by the _Communist
Party_ towards the struggle. On account of the "affectionate
pressure" from Gandhi and motivated by the rising _anti-imperialist_
feelings of the people, they renounced their own
stand and gave approval to the _Quit India Resolution_. The
_Communist Party_, on the other hand, adhered to its own
stand till the end --- this was the only difference.

The entire Congress leadership, including Gandhi,
Nehru and Azad utilized as ever before the situation arising
out of the present war as an opportunity to protect their own
(_bourgeois_) class interests by bargaining with the British
rulers. They subordinated the hatred towards fascism, sympathy
towards the Soviet Union and China and all other
sentiments to the policy of bargain with the rulers. They
were ready to cooperate in the war efforts if the government
was prepared to accept their conditions; otherwise, they would
launch a struggle that would obstruct the efforts of the government --- this
was the attitude of the Congress leadership.

The _Communist Party_ totally disagreed with this. The
Party pointed out that in the _anti-fascist_ war which was going
to decide the future of mankind, mobilizing masses against
fascism was not the concern of the British alone, but also of
the whole Indian people. The demands raised by the Congress
were just. The Party had no doubt about it. The Party
regarded that the British fighting the war without acceding
to these demands and with such policies as would only result
in creating discontent among the people was in effect defeating
their own efforts. It mobilized all its resources to place these
views before the people. Since the Party's propaganda campaigns
had this _anti-British_ component, the government's
repressive weapons were also used against it. Yet, the Party
maintained that launching the _Quit India Struggle_ in protest
against the adamant attitude of the British in a manner helpful
to the Japanese invasion was like burning the castle to kill
the rat.

It may be recalled that the call for the _Quit India
Struggle_ was given by the Congress when the historic battle
of Stalingrad was going on in Europe, while in the east the
Japanese forces had reached the eastern borders of India. In
that situation the Communist Party proposed that it was not
enough to conduct country-wide campaigns against the adamant
attitude of the British rulers and to build pressure in order to
compel them to concede the demands, but it was also necessary
to take all steps, including guerrilla war, against the
Japanese aggressors to stop the advance of fascism, should
Japanese fores crossed the Indian borders. The Party was of
the opinion that the Congress and other _anti-imperialist_
organizations must also conduct activities on a number of
war-time problems such as providing medical aid to the
victims of bombardment and organizing people against
hoarders and black-marketeers, including profiteering by
exploiting the war-time situation.

Nehru had at one stage agreed to these proposals. He
expressed the opinion in favour of organizing guerrilla squads
in areas falling to the Japanese forces. But after holding talks
with Gandhi, he gave up the idea. Yet, the Party did not
swerve. Furthermore, during the _Quit India Struggle_, the _Communist
Party_ acted in accordance with the programme which
was even accepted at least partly by Nehru at one stage. It
did not hesitate to establish contact with the government and
accept the assistance necessary for carrying out this programme.

Even while engaged in these activities, however, the _Communist
Party_ continued to organize campaigns against the
government's policy of refusing to arrive at an understanding
with the Congress on India's national demands and against
arresting them en masse.

This was a policy which was adopted not only by _Indian
Communists_ but also by Communists all over the world
during the _anti-fascist_ war. The French _Communist Party_,
the most glorious of them, devoted everything for the _anti-fascist_
guerrilla war. The Communist parties of the present
day Asian Socialist countries of Vietnam, Laos, Kampuchia,
Korea and China and the parties in other occupied countries
of Malaya, Burma, and Indonesia had accepted different
kinds of assistance including military training and military
hardware form the imperialist countries including Britain and
USA during the anti-Japanese war. It was with these materials
that the Communist parties and other _anti-fascist_
organizations in those countries prepared the people for the
fight against the colonial domination immediately after the
termination of the Second World War.

Such a situation did not develop in India. The Japanese
forces had to retreat even before entering India. The
_Communist Party_, however, did make some efforts, in a small
way though, to meet any Japanese attack. The authorities
had come forward to give training in guerrilla warfare to the
Communists for that purpose. The Party did not hesitate
to obtain assistance from the departments concerned for
organizing defence against air raids, etc.

At the same time, the _Communist Party_ organized massive
campaigns exposing the anti-people politics of the government
and stressing the fact that the _anti-fascist_ war could not be
fought keeping the Congress leaders behind the bars.
Simultaneously, the Party also made efforts to foster trade
unions, peasants organizations socio-cultural associations
and organizations of students, youth and women and to
bring the masses in the struggles against hoarding and black-marketeering
and against price rise and famine. The Party
also organized struggles against hoarders and black-marketeers
by systematically organizing relief work in the 1943
famine in Bengal and other provinces. As a result of all these
activities, there was tremendous increase in the membership
of the Party, the circulation of Party journals and people's
contributions to party fund.

It is often stated that the reason for the success of the
Party was that they were able to freely carry on their activities
while the Congress leaders were behind the bars and
the Socialists were working underground. That this was
hardly the truth can be seen from the fate of M N Roy and
other _Royists_ who were fully cooperating with government
during the same period. They enjoyed more freedom than the
_Communist Party_. It may be stated that the although many
of the Party leaders were released from prison, a number of
them had still remained inside. Similarly, though the arrest
warrants against many had been withdrawn, many others were
forced to remain underground. Cases against many leaders
were still pending in courts. It may be noted that the _Royists_
were free from all these problems. In spite of this, they met
with their doom because they were functioning as an appendage
of the government giving up the independent stand of
the working class. The _Communist Party_, on the other hand,
was opposing the _Quit India Struggle_ by organizing countrywide
campaigns against the general policies of the government.

This, however, does not mean that the _Communist
Party_ did not commit any error in translating its general
approach towards the _Quit India Struggle_ into practical
activities. Failing to properly appreciating the popular feelings
behind the struggle, the Party had often displayed a
tendency to denounce those participating in the struggle as
fascist agents. It had also made certain errors in organizing
mass struggles during this period. All such errors were subjected
later to severe self-criticism, particularly in the Second
Party Congress held in Calcutta in 1948.

Despite the omissions and commissions, the Party adopted
a policy which was by and large correct during the
_Quit India Struggle_. The Party combined _anti-imperialism_
with anti-fascism. It adopted an independent working class
revolutionary attitude facing both the provocations and
threats from the rulers and the rising popular sentiments
under the leadership of the _bourgeoisie_. The Communists
came out as a party independently organizing the people
while striving to criticize the British rulers who were fighting
the war while suppressing the people and their leaders, Bose
and his follows who were rejoicing at the victory of the fascist
forces and operating on the expectation that they would
be able to liberate India with their assistance, and the Congress
leadership which was looking upon the _anti-fascist_ war
as an opportunity to bargain with the British rulers. The
_Communist Party_ engaged itself in the task of organizing the
working class, the peasantry and other working masses on
the basis of this political approach of _anti-imperialism_ combined
with anti-fascism.

It was for the first time that the _Communist Party_ was
rising to such a level. With this it became clear that an
independent working class revolutionary party, small though,
had come into being standing on its on legs and challenging
the _bourgeois_ leadership. This constituted the meaning of
the growth of the Party at this stage.

## NEGOTIATION ATTEMPT THAT FAILED

Although the _Communist Party_ made great strides
during the _Quit India Struggle_ as compared to the earlier
period, it could not bring about any substantial change in
the political situation in the country. The Congress leadership
continued to be the symbol of people's aspiration for
freedom. Although the struggle failed, the freedom loving
people put it on a still higher pedestal. Politically, the _Muslim
League_ and other caste and communal parties continued
to be the forces capable of effectively challenging the Congress.
As a consequence, the post-war Indian politics was
again centred around negotiations among the Congress, the
British rulers, and the caste-communal parties including the
_Muslim League_.

Even when the _Quit India Resolution_ was adopted, Gandhi
and other Congress leaders had thought that things might
move in that direction. This explains the attempts made by
them to establish contact with the _League_ leaders in the days
immediately preceding the adoption of the resolution. It may
be recalled that the Congress President Azad and Gandhi
himself had made it clear that the Congress would not be
troubled even if the _Muslim League_ formed a government
at the Centre, provided it contained the essence of freedom.
It was, in fact, leaving the door open for negotiations on this
basis that the _Quit India Resolution_ was adopted by the
Congress. Furthermore, Gandhi had announced in his speech
before the _AICC_ that he would try to keep in touch with the
Viceroy as authorized by the resolution before launching
the struggle.

But the government arrested the Congress leaders
en masse without providing them opportunities for starting
such negotiations. It was followed by a communiqué issued
by the government justifying these actions. The communiqué
was designed to create hatred towards the Congress
among all those, particularly the foreigners, who wanted to
see that the fascist forces were defeated and those who felt
disturbed at any action which was likely to become an
obstruction before the war efforts. It sought to create the
impression that what was envisaged in the name of _Quit
India Struggle_ was destructive activities and if the Congress
was allowed to carry on these activities, it would doom the
_anti-fascist_ war efforts of the _Allied Powers_.

The charges levelled against the Congress and the
repressive actions resorted to by the government provided
Gandhi another opportunity to attempt to open negotiations.
Thus, on 22nd September, hardly a month and a half
after the mass arrests, Gandhi wrote a letter to the Viceroy in
which he repudiated the charges levelled against the Congress.
He sought to establish that neither he nor the Congress
could be held responsible for the destructions that had taken
place in the country. Gandhi expressedly stated that the
Congress did not approve of the destructive activities which
could have been avoided if the Congress leaders were left
free to lead the struggle. The people turned violent, according
to Gandhi, because the government, in addition to
rejecting the national demand raised by the Congress, arrested
the leaders en masse and brutally attacked the people who
were agitated over the arrests of their leaders.

Gandhi's letter was not released for publication by the
government until the middle of February 1943. A few months
later, the Congress charged the Viceroy and other officials with
deliberately withholding the contents of the letter from the
press. Basic to this allegation was the thinking that if it had
been released to the press soon after it was received, those who
were cooperating with the programme of destructive activities
thinking that it was in accordance with the instructions of
the Congress, would have withdrawn their cooperation which
would render the reason for their continued imprisonment
invalid. Interestingly, this charge was raised only after
Gandhi undertook a fast from 10th February. The fast was
undertaken on the ground that the reply he had received to
his letter of 22nd September and to the subsequent letters
was not satisfactory. Only two days after launching
the fast did the government reveal it to public. The
correspondence exchanged between Gandhi and the Viceroy
was released to the press by way of explaining the position
of the government.

The letter exchanged between Gandhi and the Viceroy
revealed that the Congress represented by Gandhi had no
sympathy at all either to the Socialists who were venturing to
give a revolutionary character to the _Quit India Struggle_, nor
to Bose who had been striving to liberate India with the
military assistance of Japan. The call for the struggle was
given as part of the usual pressure tactics to bring the authorities
once again to negotiations which were broken off as
a result of the failure of the _Cripps mission_.

The government took a rigid attitude to this struggle as
they did in the case of the 1932 _civil disobedience movement_.
They were determined to use all forces against the Congress.
The entire government machinery was brought in, including
the police and the military, in such a way as had never been
witnessed since the 1857 revolt. So Gandhi had to find a way
out of the crisis and the letter of 22nd September was a
first step taken in that direction. Further, this was another
example to show that _bourgeois_ politics could be handled
cleverly under the veil of spirituality. On the sole issue
of the repression let loose by the government all over
the country, Gandhi launched upon a twentyone-days fast on
the ground that the only weapon in the hands of a _satyagrahi_
facing violence was "self-affliction". And in the explanation
given to this action lay hidden an extremely clever _bourgeois_
political strategy.

Gandhi's statement that he and his colleagues could not
be held responsible for the destructive activities could be
interpreted to mean a denunciation of the destructive
activities themselves and based on this interpretation, the
government could release the Congress leaders from prison
and start negotiations with them as envisaged by Gandhi.
But this was possible only if the government was willing for
that. Alternatively, Gandhi's statement could be interpreted
in another manner which did not require denunciation of
the destructive activities. That is, the people who were agitated
and provoked by the brutal repression let loose by the
government simply gave expression to their natural feeling
in a way which was different from the Congress method of
agitation. In other words, negotiate with the authorities if
opportunities are open for it; otherwise, go along the way of
popular sentiments as far as possible and keep the people
under their sway without denouncing the violence on their
part --- this was the strategy.

However, the rulers too played _bourgeois_ politics. As
indicated earlier, even Winston Churchill who was known to be
a hard-core defender of imperialism had come to the conclusion
that Britain would have to leave India after the war. But,
since they were not willing to do so in the midst of the war,
they were determined to preserve their authority and rule
through organized repression, while the Congress was striving
to demonstrate and enhance its popularity among the
people through the '_Quit India Struggle_'. That was why the
Congress leaders were arrested en masse soon after the
_AICC_ meeting. And for the same reason, the rulers made
it clear from the beginning of the exchange of letters between
Gandhi and the Viceroy that they were not prepared to
let up the repressive actions. In a letter wrote to Gandhi before
the commencement of fast, the Viceroy stated:

>...but you many rest assured that the charges against the
Congress will have to be met sooner or later and it will
then be for you and your colleagues to clear yourselves
before the world, if you can. And if in the meanwhile
you yourself, by any action such as you now appear to be
contemplating, attempt to find an easy way out, the judgement
will go against you by default.[^26/2]

[^26/2]: D. G. Tendulkar, _Mahatma_, Vol 6, p. 192.

The meaning of this passage is evident. The Viceroy
was making an open declaration in unambiguous terms that the
government would not do anything to avert a possible danger
to the life of Gandhi as a result of the prolonged fasting. It
also constituted a warning to the effect that the military had
been kept ready to face the repercussions of Gandhi's possible
death in detention.

Luckily, nothing untoward, as the Viceroy expected,
happened. The fast, though precarious at times, passed off
its stipulated period. It ended with both parties holding
their respective positions firm: the authorities in their policy
of repression and Gandhi protesting against the repression.

Meanwhile the Congress President Azad, who came to
know of the fast from the newspaper, wrote a long letter to
the Viceroy in which he repeated what Gandhi had explained
in his own letters to the Viceroy. It became clear that the
line of argument with regard to the destructive activities was
not of Gandhi alone, but it was the line of the Congress
leadership as a whole. Thus, everyone understood that, like
Gandhi, the entire leadership of the Congress was searching
for a way out of the situation created by the incidents that
took place following the events of 9th August.

Utilizing the situation, Rajagopalachari who had left
the Congress a few months before the _Quit India Struggle_,
and the liberal leaders like Sapru began attempts to bring
the Congress and the government together for negotiations.
These attempts received support from a wide spectrum of
political opinions in different countries including England and
the United States. Suggestions began to come up that since
the Congress had authoritatively stated to be not in favour
of destructive activities, there was no justification for the
continued imprisonment of the leaders and that the stage
should be set for the formation of governments at the Centre
and in the provinces with the participation of the Congress
and the _Muslim League_ and for preparing a constitution acceptable
to all political opinions in the country. An atmosphere
conducive to negotiations began to appear.

There was, however, one pre-condition for the success
of these efforts: the release of the Congress leaders from
prison. The British were not prepared to do that. Having
known for sure that they would have to leave India after the
war, the British rulers decided to keep Gandhi and other
Congress leaders in prison until the war was over. They did
not even permit the leaders to exchange letters between them
and the leaders like Jinnah who were outside the prison.
The Congress leadership had no alternative other than
remaining in prison until the war was over.

## AN ALTERNATIVE _BOURGEOIS_ LEADERSHIP

The principal reason for the failure of the attempts
made by the Congress to start negotiations was the fact that
the British rulers were able to utilize the _bourgeois_ leadership
which had emerged in the meantime as an alternative to the
Congress, against the Congress and other organizations of
the movement for national independence. This _bourgeois_
alternative was the _Muslim League_ which had started functioning
as an organized political force raising the central
slogan of 'Pakistan'. It rendered valuable assistance to the
British authorities in facing the _Quit India Struggle_. In place
of the Congress slogan of '_Quit India_', Jinnah raised the
slogan of 'Divide India, and Quit'.

Apparently, this slogan was against both the Congress
and the British rulers. The _League_ was equally interested in
the British leaving the country, but not in the manner as
demanded by the Congress. The _League_ did not want to
see the Congress rising to the position of leading a united
India. Consequently, just as the Congress slogan "_Quit
India_' inspired the Indian people in general, so the _League_
slogan "Divide India, and Quit' inspired the Muslim masses.

We have already explained the general background in
which the Indian politics had reached this state. Ever since the
national demand for _Swaraj_ came to be raised and the agitational
programmes including _boycott_ launched to back up
this demand, the British rulers were able to set the Muslim
community against the Congress-led national movement.
However, in those days the Muslim leaders had not been
successful in bringing the entire community under one organization.
Many of them were with the Congress. A change in
the situation came only in 1937 when the Congress ministries
came to power in some of the provinces. The _Muslim League_
under the leadership of Jinnah gained considerable
strength through agitations against the Congress ministries.
It was as a continuation of this struggle that the _League_
adopted the Pakistan resolution in 1940.

Even at this stage, the _League_ could not claim to be
the sole party representing the Muslim community. The
_League_ had little influence on the ministries in those provinces
where the Congress was a minority in the legislature.
As we have seen earlier, for example, the Fazlul Haq
government in Bengal and the Sikandar Hyat Khan government
in Punjab were independent of the _Muslim League_. In the
Muslim majority border provinces of Sind and Assam, ministries
of the Congress or under the influence of the Congress
were in power. Besides, when the Congress ministries in
the provinces resigned in 1939, the Muslim ministers in some
of these provinces functioned in ways which were opposed to
the policies of the _League_. The Sind Chief Minister Allah
Baksh issued at the initial stage of the _Quit India Struggle_ a
statement holding the British authorities responsible for the
crisis, as a consequence of which he was removed from
office.

The situation changed as the people began to line up
behind the respective slogans of the Congress and the _Muslim League_. The influence of the _League_ on the elected
Muslim members in the legislatures increased and the ministries
of Bengal, Assam and the NWF Province passed into
the hands of the _League_. In Punjab the influence of the
_League_ increased after the death by the end of 1942 of
Sikandar Hyat Khan who was firmly opposed to the _League_
demand for Pakistan. In spite of this, an official _Muslim
League_ did not come up in Punjab.

The political changes that occurred in the months
immediately following the launching of the _Quit India Struggle_
were skillfully utilized both by the British government
and Jinnah. They proceeded by creating the impression that
the entire Muslim community was solidly behind the _League_.
They also created the impression that there were other
minority communities and the depressed sections among the
Hindus which, although did not entirely agree with the
_League_'s demand for Pakistan, were generally in support of
the _League_'s anti-Congress stance. The elites among these
communities were opposed to the slogan of '_Quit India_' and
to the struggle called for by the Congress. It was, in fact,
relying on the sympathy and support of the masses behind
these elites that the British rulers resorted to repressive
actions to suppress the _Quit India Struggle_. It was the same
that emboldened the British authorities to ridicule the efforts
made by Gandhi and Azad in prison to start negotiations.

Gandhi and other Congress leaders had known well that
this had created a serious situation. They were also conscious
of the fact that it was impossible to reach a settlement
with the British ignoring the _Muslim League_ and its slogan
of Pakistan. That was why they had tried to establish contact
with the _League_ leadership before adopting the _Quit
India Resolution_. It was for the same reason that Gandhi
wrote a letter to Jinnah from the prison, which the authorities
refused to deliver to him. They had no doubt that the
unity between the Congress and the _League_ was a precondition
for the success of any negotiation that they would have
to start with the British rulers in the post-war days.

Thus, by 1942--43 the question of the British leaving
India had ceased to be a controversial one. Instead, the question
now was whether they would leave an undivided India
handing over its administration to a government with the
participation of the Congress, the _League_ and other organizations,
or they would create two independent nations --- a
Hindu India and a Muslim India --- and transfer power to
their respective leaders.

Besides, the question also emerged as to whether the
_Princely States_ numbering about 600 would be an integral
part of an undivided India, or to which country would each
of them align itself, or would they remain independent sovereign
countries.

We shall deal in later chapters with the details of the
intense arguments, uncompromising proposals, private and
open discussions among the leaders of the people, and the
like that took place before and after the end of the war.
Here we shall deal only with certain general things relating
to the understanding which formed the basis of these arguments
and discussions.

As we had referred to earlier, from the time when the
idea occurred that India must become independent, two
parallel views began to gain ground on the meaning of
'independence'. One section thought that independence meant
revival of the ancient (Hindu) kingdoms and empires and of
the socio-cultural life that prevailed in those periods which
were regarded as the golden period of Indian civilization'.
Another section thought, on the other hand, that independence
meant a re-establishment of the reign of the Badshahs of
Delhi which was the capital of India in the medieval period.
The former may be called Hindu revivalists and the letter
Islamic revivalists.

From Jinnah's 'two-nations theory' it can be understood
that the _League_ was the organization of the latter. Jinnah
argued for the creation of two independent sovereign countries
on the plea that India was not one nation but two nations,
the Hindus and the Muslims. The _Muslim League_ slogan
of 'Divide India, and Quit' was a transformation of this argument.
They accused the Congress which opposed this slogan
that they stood for 'Hindu domination'.

It may be argued that there is an element of truth in it.
From the early _Sanyasi_ revolt of Bengal to Tilak's _Ganesh Puja_
and Gandhi's _ashram_ life, one could see the influence
of Hinduism in the history of Indian national struggle. Yet
the slogans they raised were those of modern (_bourgeois_)
nationalism. Not only freedom and democracy but also reformation
of communal and ritual practices and cultural
modernization were part of the freedom movement represented
by the Congress. And similar movements of reformation and
modernization had spread among the leaders of the Muslim
community. Each of the Muslim social and political movements
right from the Aligarh movement led by Sayyed Ahamed
Khan to the _Muslim League_ led by Jinnah gave expression
to the aspirations of the _bourgeoisie_ emerging from among
the Muslims. Until 1937--38 Jinnah himself had appeared as a
nationalist raising the slogan of modernization and nationalism
against Islamic revivalism.

Basically, the Congress and the _Muslim League_ thus
represented the same (_bourgeois_) class. The leaders of both
the parties wanted this class to develop; they wanted to create
conditions (political power) for a reorganization of the
society on capitalist lines. Yet, there were contradictions
and rivalries characteristic of capitalist society between them.
The dispute between them was over the sharing of political
power which was to be acquired and the sharing of the
gains resulting form the reorganization of the society on
capitalist lines making use of this political power. It was
this dispute that manifested itself in the form of the slogans
of "_Quit India_" on the one hand, and "Divide India, and
Quit" on the other.

From the beginning the British rulers were trying to take
advantage of this rivalry to protect their own imperialist
interests. When '_Quit India_' and the two-nations theory' came
to the fore, the divide and rule' tactics of the rulers revealed
its real character. They utilized the 'two-nations theory' and
the demand for Pakistan against the slogan of '_Quit
India_'. It was a political necessity of the British to expose the
claim made by the Congress that it was the sole representative
of the Indian people. But they, at the same time, claimed
that they wished India to remain undivided. Both Lord Linlithgow
who was the Viceroy at the time when the demand
for Pakistan was raised and Lord Wavell who succeeded him
expressed the desire that "India should remain one entity for
geographical and political reasons". And Lord Mountbatten
who at last performed the division tried to impress upon the
people that he did it reluctantly.

Having understood the tactics of the rulers, the Congress
leaders tried to devise certain counter-tactics. But the political
situation that prevailed was such that any such attempt was
bound to end in failure. One of the reasons for this was the
fact that the views held by most Congress leaders including
Gandhi contained elements of Hinduism. But what was more
important was that the British rulers were able to utilize the
Islamic views which had exerted considerable influence on
the Muslim communal leaders against India's national
demands. A modern secular political leadership had not yet
emerged capable of countering the Hindu and Islamic
varieties of the revivalist movements and their possible repercussions
on the Indian political life. And the frightening
consequences of this situation manifested themselves in 1944
and thereafter.

## THE CRISIS

Gandhi's fast and the attitude of the authorities towards
it put the Congress in a serious crisis. When the _Quit India
Struggle_ was launched the Congress leaders expected a mass
upsurge to take place compelling the authorities to seek
negotiations. That did not happen. On the contrary, the
authorities were determined not to enter into negotiations
with the Congress, even if Gandhi was to die fasting in
prison. The Congress leaders reached a dead end finding no
way out of the dilemma created by this situation.

The British rulers too were in a dilemma. Although
they had boasted that they had succeeded in suppressing the
_Quit India Struggle_ and were able to carry with them the
different organizations like the _Muslim League_, the mass
support to the Congress was increasing. A new generation was
emerging in India drawing inspiration from the underground
organizations which had been created following the suppression
of the _Quit India Struggle_ and from the activities of the
_INA_. Although keeping aloof from the _Quit India Struggle_,
the _Communist Party_ which had been organizing popular
agitations for the release of the Congress leaders and for
other demands of the people was also growing. The different
streams of _anti-imperialism_ were steadily gaining strength.

In the political field, certain developments took place in
the early months of 1943 which were likely to produce long-term
results. During and after Gandhi's fast, the liberal
leaders and certain former Congress leaders like Rajagopalachari
came out with the suggestion to start talks between the
Congress and the _Muslim League_ in order to find a solution
to the political problems. Presiding over a conference held
in 1943, the _League_ President Jinnah wondered why Gandhi
who had been continually writing letters to the Viceroy was
not writing to him. In response to this Gandhi wrote a letter
to Jinnah which the government refused to deliver to him
causing a storm of protest inside and outside the country.
Different sections of the people in England openly accused
the government of thwarting all attempts to find a solution
to the political problems.

To cap it all, a famine broke out in India, particularly
in Bengal, in 1943. Several thousands of people starved to
death under a government which was claiming itself to be
"functioning efficiently". The rulers and their agents tried
to make it out that the famine was caused by drought, which
was accentuated by uncontrolled increase in the population.
But any knowledgeable person knew that famine, rather
than being the result of nature's failure, was man made.

Democratic minded people pointed out that the famine
and the general price rise were due to hoarding and black-marketeering
being practised extensively by big landlords, moneylenders
and wholesale merchants utilizing the war-time situation.
Public opinion rose high against the authorities who
instead of taking actions against these anti-people elements,
were giving all protection to them. The demand came from
the people that the government should immediately release
the national leaders from prison and seek their cooperation
in the controlled distribution of food grains and other
essential articles.

The role played by the _Communist Party_ in this regard
deserves particular mention. The Party's attitude towards
the food problem as also towards the war and the problems
that arose out of the war was different from that of the
British rulers, on the one hand, and that of the organizers of
the _Quit India Struggle_, on the other. It was linked with the
solution to the day-to-day life problems of workers, peasants
and other sections of the common people.

As distinct from the organizers of the _Quit India Struggle_,
the Party had extended cooperation to the government
in matters relating to the control of the price and distribution
of food grains and other essential commodities. The Party
had campaigned against sabotage causing obstruction to these
activities. The Party had participated actively in the work
of the procurement and distribution of essential commodities
by cooperating with the authorities and by setting up separate
organizations for the purpose. The Party had organized
workers and peasants to get them engaged themselves fully
in the work of increasing industrial and agricultural production.

At the same time the Party emphatically stated that it
was impossible to control scarcity and price increase without
preventing profiteering by big landlords, wholesalers and
other vested interests. It put forward practical suggestions
to take over the stocks from big landlords and others and to
distribute them among the people. It not only demanded
actions to prevent food grains being transported from the
famine stricken areas but also formed volunteer organizations
to undertake this work where the authorities were
not prepared to do it.

The activities of peasant organizations engaged in these
jobs and the trade unions agitating against the capitalists
who were standing in the way of increased production in
factories became more wide-spread. Besides, the Party's
political campaigns went on emphasizing that the government
would not be able to solve these problems as long as they
kept the popular national leaders in prison.

The propaganda campaigns and the relief work organized
by the Party at the all-India level with regard to the Bengal
famine created a small ripple in Indian politics. It was true
that a considerable section of the people in the country did
not show favour towards these activities on the ground that
they were being organized by a party which was opposed to
the _Quit India Struggle_. They even opposed these activities.
However, it created considerable impact on those _non-Communist_
democrats who did not share the _Quit India_
politics. The approach of the Party during the campaign in
connection with Bengal famine was to serve the people under
any circumstance and under any condition and expose the
anti-people forces, and to state openly that the greatest
obstruction on the path of putting the anti-people forces in
their proper place was the policies of the British rulers.
Although keeping itself aloof from the Socialist Party and
other groups engaged in giving an organized character to the
_Quit India Struggle_ after its suppression and from the Congress
leadership which called for the struggle, the _Communist
Party_ had been building a movement against the exploitation
by the landlords, wholesalers and other vested interests
and against the anti-people character of the British rulers
who were abetting these exploiters.

Although famine, price rise and starvation death were
acute in Bengal, they were common throughout India. In each
province they showed up in accordance with its own characteristics,
but the crisis of the socio-economic system manifested
itself everywhere. Both the social life that continued
to exist for centuries and the administrative system that
had been there for decades were crumbling. The famine and
price rise were the outward manifestations of the deep crisis
that had affected all aspects of human life. The progressive,
_anti-imperialist_ minded people had no doubt that the solution
to this problem was to change India's existing socio-economic
system after ending the British rule. There was no difference
of opinion on the point that this task had to be accomplished
as soon as possible. The differences were on how to accomplish
this task. In the opinion of the _Communist Party_ the
immediate task was to turn the people against the vested
interests and the rulers by rendering all assistance to the
victims of famine, price rise and starvation taking help
from the government for this purpose. In the views of other
nationalists, there was no question of seeking the help of
the Government for the famine relief activities until the
foreign rulers left the country. There were sharp conflicts
between these to view points all over the country.

This situation created its impacts outside India also. The
famine stricken Bengal and other provinces demonstrated
the fact that the rulers were "efficient" only in keeping
the Congress leaders in prison and not in the procurement and
distribution of the essential articles to the people. It became
also clear that the government lacked the willingness to
seek the cooperation of the people and their leaders and also
capability to solve the problem without their cooperation and
that the continuance of this situation was dangerous to the
war efforts of the _Allied Powers_. In these circumstances, an
important change took place in the government. Viceroy
Linlithgow relinquished his post and his position was taken
over by Lord Wavell who was the Commander-in-Chief of
the British armed forces in India.

Apparently, this was only a change of the individual.
Lord Wavell was a party to all the decisions taken by Lord
Linlinthgow as the Viceroy. In fact, it was only because of
the obstinate attitude of Lord Wavell that the suggestion
(which was acceptable to the Congress) to form a government
at the Centre handing over the power of all the departments
including the defence to Indians was finally rejected during
the talks with the _Cripps mission_. So, the change in the
person who occupied the viceregal position was of no consequence.

However, the circumstance under which Linlithgow had
to relinquish the position is noteworthy. Durga Das had
stated in his memoirs that the American Presidential Representative
in India, W. Phillips, had told him that President
Roosevelt had suggested to British authorities that only a
person more imaginative than Linlithgow would be able to
solve the _Indian problem_. In an interview allowed to Durga
Das before quitting office, Lintithgow was reported to
have stated that India need not wish for independence for
another fifty years and that since the parliamentary system
would not grow in India, the British officers would have to
remain in India permanently.

It had become clear to the authorities in England and
to their foreign friends that it was unwise to try to solve the
_Indian problem_ by keeping such a person at the top of the
administration in India. In the existing political conditions
it was inevitable to create the impression that a change in
the situation was needed.

It was true that the situation did not change fundamentally
even after Lord Wavell became the Viceroy. That was
why when effective talks had to be started with regard to the
transfer of power in 1946--47, the Labour government which
was then in power sent Lord Mountbatten as the Viceroy. But
Wavell's appointment helped to create the impression of a
change at least for the time being. Certain steps he had taken
immediately after assuming office were in accord with this
impression. For instance, he visited the famine stricken areas
in Bengal. Besides, he ordered for the release of Gandhi on 6th
may, who had been ill in the prison since April 1944. Other
political leaders who were detained along with Gandhi in
the Aga Khan Palace were also released.
