# Fighting "The Inevitable": Stopping National Health Insurance at All Costs[^2/0]

Health care reform seems inevitable
these days. Nearly everyone agrees that the time has come to
mend the United States' patchwork system of health care. It appears to
be out of control, as it races toward consuming 18 percent of national
resources---more than $1 trillion a year---while it still does not cover at
least 37 million Americans. [^2/1] Since 1992, President Bill Clinton and his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, have raised expectations that they will succeed
in overhauling the way we receive and pay for medical care.

This is not the first time reform has seemed inevitable. Five times
previously liberal reformers believed they were on the brink of restructuring
the delivery or financing of health care to make it more widely
available and more affordable to greater numbers of people. But each
time, they ran into a no-holds-barred battle with the forces of reaction
led by the conservative leaders of the American Medical Association.
The AMA won every battle but one, the passage of federal Medicare for
the elderly.

With that one exception, the AMA has managed to stave off significant
reform for most of the century. The AMA is responsible, in large
part, for the way we get our health care today. And the health-care system
bears its stamp: it is a system that has made American doctors the wealthiest
in the world, but allows the health of Americans to lag behind those
in many other industrialized countries.

The history of the AMA and the five previous battles reveal the
AMA's true interests: the protection of doctors, their control of the system,
and their earnings. It also reveals the AMA's tactics and strategies.
The AMA has won by creating coalitions to directly defeat reform bills or
by working with key lawmakers to stall legislation until the moment for
change passes. Although the AMA's power has waned, it still looms as a
key factor when lawmakers ponder whether reform is politically possible.

The AMA is now engaged in the sixth battle over health-care reform.
Early on, the AMA set out to protect the existing system by promoting
limited reform to avert a major restructuring or greater government involvement.
And the AMA declared war on any proposals that borrowed
from the Canadians' government-run "single-payer" health-care system.

The AMA has sought to refashion its image from an obstacle to a
proponent of change. But, as in the past, it has evolved from acknowledging
the need for reform to adopting a hard line against it. AMA
leaders employ a sophisticated doublespeak, proclaiming "the status quo
must go," while actually opposing fundamental structural change. They
attack national systems in other countries by insisting on an "American"
solution. And they resort to scare tactics, raising alarms of "rationing" as
they did in the past with cries of "socialism."

The AMA has vowed to use every tactic and spend every dollar it can
to protect what it deems as the best interests of patients and doctors during
the national-health-care debate. Let the public beware: the AMA is
playing for keeps, and it is working for doctors. When the battle is over,
the AMA may be five out of six.

## THE FIRST BATTLE

Many leaders of the AMA were among those who thought compulsory
health insurance was inevitable in the years before 1920. At the time, the
AMA was in its Progressive phase, fighting for federal regulation of food
and drugs and a federal department of health run by a doctor, and the
prospect did not alarm it. In fact, the AMA stopped just short of endorsing
a model health-insurance bill in 1916. In a letter to the bill's authors,
Dr. Frederick R. Green, secretary of the AMA's Council on Health and
Public Instruction, wrote, "Your plans are so entirely in line with our own
that I want to be of every possible assistance."[^2/2]

The proposal was a cross between the German and English systems
and was meant for the working class only. German chancellor Otto von
Bismarck adopted the first national health program in 1883, mainly to
buy workers' loyalty to the government in the face of a popular socialist
movement. Versions of the program soon spread to most European nations.
A form of it reached Great Britain in 1911, when Prime Minister
Lloyd George established a government-run health system.

Reformers in the United States proposed a system that would help
workers pay for doctors, hospitals, medicine, maternity benefits, and
even funerals. Employers and employees each would kick in 40 percent
of the cost, and the government would pick up the rest. It was "compulsory"
because nearly all workers making under $1,200 a year would
be required to participate. Middleand upper-class people would continue
to pay for their own care, which was then delivered primarily by
family doctors.

But the AMA had its concerns, fearing that reformers night use insurance
laws to change the traditional way that doctors practiced medicine.
In this tradition, which the AMA had helped create, each doctor
worked independently, charged patients a fee for each service rendered,
expected patients to pay at the time of treatment, and provided free care
to those whom doctors deemed worthy of charity. Some reformers said
medical care could be delivered more efficiently if doctors instead
worked in groups and were paid a fixed annual amount for each patient,
with the payments spread among a pool of people through insurance or
taxes. But the AMA adamantly opposed those changes because they
would undermine physician control and limit their potential earnings.

To study the proposal---and protect the doctors' way of life---the
AMA set up a Committee on Social Insurance, chaired by a prominent
AMA member and insurance proponent, Dr. Alexander Lambert. He
was the doctor of former President Teddy Roosevelt, a supporter of compulsory
health insurance in his failed bid for president as the Progressive
candidate. For his staff, Lambert hired the Progressives' insurance expert,
Dr. Isaac M. Rubinow, a nonpracticing doctor, Russian immigrant,
and socialist.

Lambert and Rubinow advanced three arguments for compulsory
health insurance. First, it was good for the people. "No other social movement
in modern economic development is so pregnant with benefit to
the public," said an editorial in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_.[^2/3]
Most people simply did not have access to a doctor or medical care.
An AMA official had earlier estimated that each year there were 600,000
deaths and 3 million illnesses at a cost of $1.5 billion in economic loss
from preventable illness.[^2/4] Second, it would boost doctors'incomes. _JAMA_
reported that some British doctors saw their incomes double in poor industrial
districts under national health insurance.[^2/5] And finally, it was
inevitable. If Great Britain had adopted it, the thinking went, surely the
United States was not far behind.

To head off any major changes that might threaten doctors'incomes
or autonomy, the AMA's policy-setting House of Delegates in 1917 laid
down guidelines for health-insurance plans. The first insisted the insured
have freedom to choose their own physician, which would help
preserve independent practice. The second required payment of the
physician in proportion to the amount of work done, which would protect
the fee-for-service system. The third sought to relieve doctors from
administrative work. And the last sought to ensure AMA influence by requiring
M.D. representation on the program's oversight agencies.[^2/6]

### A Hostile Turnaround

But it was during 1917 that momentum for social change began to flag in
the United States. Within the ranks of the AMA, a split over national
health insurance grew. Generally, doctors at medical schools favored it,
and practicing physicians---fearing it was a threat to their autonomy and
incomes---opposed it. Meanwhile commercial insurance firms lobbied
against a government plan and business fretted about the costs. Even the
head of the American Federation of Labor opposed it because it took
away an issue he could use to organize workers. Many special-interest
groups lined up against it; few groups formed to support it.

When the United States entered the World War, an anti-German
fever spread at the AMA and across the country. The AMA's president
urged a witch-hunt for disloyal German doctors. Soon compulsory
health insurance was tainted as "un-American" because of its origins in
Germany. Following the Russian revolution, the AMA became caught up
in the Red Scare sweeping the country. And some AMA leaders branded
national health insurance as a detestable form of "socialism."

By 1920 the aura of inevitability surrounding compulsory health insurance
had vanished. _JAMA_ began publishing attacks on it, and the
AMA's Dr. Green denied he had ever embraced it. States that had considered
the model bill dropped it, and the concept was DOA at the AMA's
annual meeting. The House of Delegates dissolved the Committee on
Social Insurance and passed a resolution that stood for years as official
policy: the AMA is opposed to any compulsory plan of health insurance
run or regulated by any state or the federal government.

After the meeting, Lambert wrote to the reform group pushing
health insurance, advising it to go forward without organized medicine.
He told the reformers to offer physicians a fair proposition, and then
hammer the inadequacy of the health-care system and the profession's
refusal to improve it. "That will throw them on the defensive," he
wrote. Meanwhile, Lambert was philosophical about the AMA's Germanbashing
and red-baiting. "I think that my profession will get over its present
state of hysteria just as my ancestors got over the Salem witchcraft,"
he wrote. "They had it bad at that time, and the profession has got it
bad' now."[^2/7]

## THE SECOND BATTLE

In simple, stark, and shocking terms, the AMA's key spokesman in 1932
described what he saw as the struggle over the future of medical care in
the United States: "The alinement \[sic\] is clear---on one side the forces
representing the great foundations, public health officialdom, social
theory---even socialism and communism---inciting to revolution; on
the other side, the organized profession ... urging an orderly evolution
..."[^2/8]

A dozen years had passed since the AMA had turned against compulsory
health insurance, and in that time, physicians had come into
their own. By the 1930s physicians and the AMA had succeeded in shaping
the health-care system so that doctors were the dominant force. But
contrary to Lambert's prediction, the AMA had not gotten over its hysteria.
It still had it bad.

The declaration of war came from the pen of Dr. Morris Fishbein,
the glib, prolific, and omnipresent editor of the _AMA Journal_. For more
than a quarter of a century Fishbein personified the AMA, his visibility
spread through countless articles, columns, and books, and his voice well
known from myriad speeches and radio broadcasts. He had earned an
M.D., but he never practiced; he joined the staff of the _Journal of the
American Medical Association_ as an assistant editor in 1913 and rose to its
editorship in 1924. He remained in that post until the AMA Board, long
outshone by the editor, ousted him in a coup in 1949. Fishbein turned
the journal into the AMA's meal ticket; he became the AMA's mouthpiece.
A master of the well-turned phrase, Fishbein supplied physicians
with verbal ammunition against any and all perceived enemies of
organized medicine. And he decided that the Committee on the Costs of
Medical Care was a threat to the AMA and to doctors.

Founded in 1927, the committee had forty-five members that included
doctors---twenty-three had medical degrees---academics, social
workers, insurance company executives, and others. Eight private foundations
underwrote the committee's $1 million cost. The committee
had made it a point to reach out to the AMA. Indeed, its chairman was
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, a former AMA president and staunch Republican
who served as Secretary of the Interior under Herbert Hoover.

Over five years, the committee produced the most comprehensive
and detailed survey of health care in more than two dozen studies. It
came up with the first estimate of national health expenditures: $3.66
billion, or 4 percent of the national income. A study found about 30 cents
of every dollar spent on health care went to pay doctors. Another report
said only half of lower-income families had received medical care, and
the country needed a new, more efficient system to make sure they could.

The health-care system recommended by the majority of the committee
relied on group practices---that is, several doctors working together
collectively---based at hospitals. That would be a big change from
the way medicine was practiced, with each doctor working alone, usually
out of an office. To finance the care for most Americans, the majority
recommended using insurance, taxes, or both. To pay for the poor, it said
local governments should share the cost on a per capita or lump-sum
basis. But the majority said doctors should be allowed to continue in the
traditional fee-for-service practice. And while the majority backed voluntary
insurance, it rejected compulsory insurance.

That should have made the doctors on the committee happy. But it
didn't. In a sharply worded dissent, eight physicians declared the status
quo was just fine. They rejected group practice as "mass production"
medicine and insisted"the central place in medical practice" belonged to
the independent, fee-for-service general practitioner. As for financing,
the doctors attacked voluntary health insurance as a "bridge" to a compulsory
system. Government's only role should be to care for the poor,
they said, "with the ultimate object of relieving the medical profession of
this burden."[^2/9]

Fishbein immediately endorsed the dissenting doctors' view. His editorials
contained some of his most acerbic attacks, such as calling group
practices "medical soviets." Wilbur J. Cohen, an architect of Social Security
and a key figure in health policy, said Fishbein launched the AMA's
"devil theory of history" with his writings: liberals pushing national
health insurance sought to persecute doctors, not bring care to unserved
millions. Cohen added, "His use of that incendiary language set the tone
of the discussions for years to come."[^2/10]

### Intimidating Roosevelt

By the mid-1930s the country was struggling with the Great Depression,
and the nation's health-care problems appeared even starker than
before. With upwards of 14 million workers suddenly unemployed,
agitation for social legislation had regained credibility. The time seemed
ripe for the passage for compulsory health insurance. The AMA feared
Franklin D. Roosevelt would tack it on to his Social Security legislation.

In January 1935 a federal panel, appointed by Roosevelt, called for
expanded public health programs and nationwide preventive medicine.
It also suggested the cost of health care be paid for with insurance. But
the AMA intimidated Roosevelt. He did not recommend adoption of
compulsory health insurance because he feared it would be used to block
Social Security legislation and its retirement benefits for the elderly, regardless
of income. The Social Security bill that came to Congress for
consideration in 1935 mentioned health insurance in only one line, and
that merely called for it to be studied. Yet even that line was deleted after
the AMA sent telegrams protesting it.

The AMA did not take its victory for granted. In February 1935 it
called a rare special session of its House of Delegates to reaffirm the
guidelines placing doctors in control of all medical care and practice that
they had established for any "social experiment in changing the nature of
medical practice." And the AMA took its fight to every arena, and conducted
surrogate battles through state and local medical societies.

AMA-affiliated medical societies launched a boycott against the Borden
Milk Co. to get at the Milbank Fund, which the company funded and
which advocated compulsory health insurance. The boycott worked.
Milbank fired its director and muted its program on health.[^2/11]

When federal employees organized the Group Health Association in
Washington---creating what would now be called a health-maintenance
organization---to provide medical care to government workers at a fixed
fee per person, the local medical society and the AMA responded in 1937
by expelling the doctors and seeking to end their hospital privileges. The
federal government successfully sued the AMA for antitrust. But more
often such actions by AMA affiliates went unchallenged.[^2/12]

And the AMA created its own "research" to knock other studies. For
example, a government study found a large proportion of the population
could not afford to pay for medical care and that the care given was
inadequate. The AMA surveyed its medical-society affiliates, and, not
surprisingly, found, "Fully 90 percent of all the sources consulted reported
they knew of no significant number of persons needing and seeking
medical care who were unable to obtain it." But as AMA historian
James G. Burrow noted, despite such assurances, "an increasing percentage
of the population became harder to convince."[^2/13]

### No New Deal on Health

In July 1938 health-reform advocates in the Roosevelt administration or
chestrated a three-day National Health Conference in Washington, D.C.,
to sell a national health program. Studies presented there showed
health-care needs had outgrown the health-care system---a third of the
population received inadequate or no medical service, and an even
larger segment suffered financially from illness. The conference recommended
a program that the states would operate with federal subsidies.
It called for expanded public-health services as well as maternal and
child health services, through the Social Security system; expansion of
hospital facilities; increased aid for those on relief or who had no money
for health care; and a plan to compensate lost wages from a temporary or
permanent disability. It also called for a comprehensive medical program
financed by insurance, or taxes, or both.

Once again, a national health-insurance plan appeared to be inevitable.
In a private meeting, AMA leaders offered the Roosevelt administration
a deal: the AMA would support all of the other proposals if the
Administration would drop compulsory health insurance. The Administration
rejected the deal. When the AMA called another special session
of its House of Delegates, it publicly adopted the terms of the spurned
deal. To avoid national health insurance, the AMA was willing to make
concessions.

But circumstances once again dissipated the aura of inevitability,
rendering many of the AMA's concessions unnecessary. Roosevelt
backed off from personally pushing the suggested reforms after a more
conservative Congress was elected in 1938. The health-care bills introduced
by New Deal legislators went nowhere. The entire movement
ground to a halt soon after the United States entered World War II. The
AMA stalled long enough so that changing politics and war again shoved
social reform aside.[^2/14]

## THE THIRD BATTLE

The AMA went into shock in 1948. President Harry S Truman defied
conventional wisdom and defeated the Republican presidential candidate,
Thomas E. Dewey. Truman had made health care a major issue in
his campaign, lashing out at the "well-organized medical lobby" and the
"Republican 80th 'do-nothing' Congress." While Dewey sided with the
Republicans on health care, Truman chided them for killing the national
health plan he had supported when he became President following
Roosevelt's death.[^2/15]

The Democratic plan sought to create a national health system
under Social Security that would cover everyone, regardless of income,
and would be run by the federal government. It was the most farreaching
proposal ever offered, and it was the first to be backed by
a president. When Truman triumphed---he also regained Democratic
control of Congress---the election was deemed a mandate for his healthinsurance
plan.

A major change in the American health-care system again appeared
to be inevitable. But this time the reform focused primarily on the financing
of care. Unlike reformers of the Progressive era, Truman did not
seek to reorganize the system by pushing doctors into group practice.
Nor did he try to change fee-for-service payments. He wanted the federal
government to finance the system so everyone, no matter how rich or
poor, would have equal access to medical care. The United States was
spending only four cents on the dollar for health care, and Truman declared,
"We can afford to pay more than 4 percent."

Although the AMA was willing to endorse federal subsidies for hospital
construction, public health departments, and medical research, it
continued to draw the line at a national health-insurance system. The
AMA acted out of ideology: it and its members railed against the encroachments
by the Big Government created under the New Deal and
feared the rise of socialism, such as had happened in Great Britain after
the war. But the AMA also sought to defend the autonomy and incomes
of its members. After all, even if the government allowed doctors to continue
to rule medical care, under a national system it could decide to
change the way medicine was delivered or even set fees. And the AMA
was wedded to the status quo.

Public sentiment, however, appeared to be running in favor of
sweeping changes, according to various polls. For example, 52 percent of
New Yorkers favored a compulsory system and 70 percent of Washington,
D.C., residents backed Truman's plan. Even a poll taken by a physicians'
group that the AMA set up to fight compulsory health insurance
found that 55 percent of those surveyed favored a federal prepaid medical
plan.[^2/16]

In 1949 the AMA kicked off a counteroffensive. In an emergency
session, it passed a special $25 assessment on its members to build a
war chest. The assessment was controversial, especially among newspapers,
whose editorial pages criticized it as unseemly. Even some doctors
blanched at the thought of a political fund. But the AMA's members
responded enthusiastically, sending in more than $2.2 million in the first
year of the campaign.[^2/17]

Meanwhile the AMA scrambled for an alternative to Truman's plan,
and found it in an innovation in health-care financing it had once
spurned---private health insurance. Over the years, _JAMA_ editor Fishbein
and other AMA spokesmen had sniped at all forms of insurance,
suggesting they might interfere with the doctor-patient relationship.
They said people should put money into savings accounts so they could
pay for health care when the need arose. And they complained that too
many people spent more money on movies and candy than on medical
services. But faced with Truman's plan, the AMA began vigorously boosting
what it called voluntary private health insurance.[^2/18] For those who
could not afford to buy insurance, the AMA unofficially backed the Republican
plan of appropriating $200 million in federal funds to subsidize
the purchase of private health insurance for the poor.

### Five Million Bucks Stop Here

To sway public opinion, starting in 1949 the AMA launched one of the
first nationwide political-public relations campaigns in U.S. history. The
AMA hired the San Francisco-based husband-wife public relations team
of Clem Whitaker and Leone Baxter, generally considered the first
modern-day political consultants. They came to the AMA's attention by
helping Earl Warren become Governor of California, and then, at the
behest of the AMA-affiliated California Medical Association, running
the campaign that defeated Warren's plan for a state-run health system.
The AMA paid Whitaker and Baxter $100,000 a year until 1952, when
they left to run the Eisenhower-Nixon presidential campaign. During its
three-and-a-half-year run, the AMA's campaign cost nearly $5 million,
an unprecedented sum.[^2/19]

Whitaker and Baxter's National Education Campaign on National
Health Insurance consisted of hundreds of pamphlets, leaflets, and radio
and print ads. The duo created coalitions with civic and farm groups,
veterans' and other conservative organizations, and businesses. They
promoted an image to capture people's imagination: an 1891 painting by
the British artist Sir Luke Fildes of an old-fashioned doctor watching
over a sick child. They printed 65,000 copies of a poster of the painting---to
be hung in physicians' offices---with the headline: KEEP POLITICS
OUT OF THIS PICTURE! The poster went on to describe compulsory
health insurance as "political medicine" that would create inferior medicine,
red tape, and a heavy tax burden, and would bring "a politician between
you and your doctor." And the AMA adopted a simple slogan:
"The Voluntary Way Is the American Way."

The campaign also resorted to red-baiting, heating up the Red Scare
already gripping the country as the hot war turned into the Cold War.
The AMA asserted the U.S. system was the best in the world, and that its
deficiencies were being greatly exaggerated. It charged Truman's program
of "socialized medicine" would turn doctors into "slaves," and
accused Truman aides of being "importers of alien philosophies."[^2/20] An
AMA president speaking on radio during peak listening time said,
"American medicine has become the blazing focal point in a fundamental
struggle which may determine whether America remains free or
whether we are to become a socialist state."[^2/21]

Within a year of the start of the intense, controversial campaign,
Whitaker and Baxter had won over the public in the debate on Truman's
plan. They had seized the initiative from Truman by redefining the issue
in the popular imagination. No longer was it a question of greater health
security, as Truman defined it. Now it was a battle over "socialized medicine."
In 1950 the effort to enact a national health-insurance plan ground
to a halt. Conservative Republicans won control of Congress, and with
the start of the Korean War, Truman backed away from national health
insurance. The AMA's stall had worked again.

## THE FOURTH BATTLE

After the AMA defeated Truman's health-insurance plan, it faced few
challenges during the 1950s. But the decade also brought about a shift in
tactics by proponents of national health insurance: focusing on the elderly.
Health needs and costs were greatest for those over sixty-five, and
the number of older people has grown steadily with the rise in standard
of living. But the system of private insurance that developed to finance
medical care began to exclude the elderly as bad risks.[^2/22]

The liberal-Democratic response was to seek to help the elderly by
including hospital coverage in the benefits they received from Social
Security. After all, senior citizens had a reasonable claim on assistance in
the Social Security program, which they had helped finance. And by accepting
Social Security, society had agreed that the elderly needed special
help

The AMA's leaders opposed any extensions of Social Security, primarily
because it covered those who could afford to pay for their own
medical costs, but also because they feared it would be an incremental
step to a national health-insurance program for everyone, regardless of
age or income. As it had in the past, the AMA insisted that the government
should help only the poor. It also said that any national program to
do even that should be run by private business or, failing that, state governments.

The war began in 1957, when an obscure Rhode Island congressman
introduced a bill to cover hospital costs for the elderly under Social
Security. The AMA reacted strongly and quickly---too much so, one of its
lobbyists said years later in retrospect. For the next eight years, the AMA
engaged in an expensive and intense battle with the AFL-CIO and other
proponents of national health insurance. In its filings with the government,
the AMA reported it spent about $1.6 million on lobbying, including
$1 million in 1965 alone for an advertising blitz. Doctors complained
they had to spend so much because of the concerted efforts of Big Labor.
But during that period, the AFL-CIO reported spending a little more
than half the AMA amount.[^2/23]

In 1960 Massachusetts Democratic senator John F. Kennedy won a
narrow victory over Republican vice president Richard M. Nixon. Enactment
of a government-run health program for the elderly stood out as a
priority on Kennedy's agenda. Once again, the AMA found itself on the
defensive. And it again responded by seeking an alternative that did little
to seriously change the status quo while protecting the dominance of
doctors. First, the AMA gave its conditional backing to a law creating
what was known as the Kerr-Mills program, in which the federal government
provided matching grants to states to offer insurance assistance to
the needy elderly. No one was particularly enthusiastic about Kerr-Mills,
named for its sponsors Senator Robert Kerr (D-Okla.) and Representative
Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.). But to the AMA, it was preferable to the legislation
that would become Medicare.

The battle to influence the public became intense. The AMA started
a mass-media campaign to counter materials being distributed by the
labor-backed National Commission of Senior Citizens. Among its propaganda
techniques, the AMA's red-baiting stood out. In the early 1960s,
for example, an actor-cum-political spokesman, Ronald Reagan, cut a
33.33 rpm record for the AMA's "Operation Coffee Cup." The AMA's
Women's Auxiliary urged doctors' wives to hold coffees to play the recording,
entitled "Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine."
Reagan warned listeners, "One of the traditional methods of imposing
statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine." If Medicare
passed, he said, "one of these days you and I are going to spend our
sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it once
was like in America when men were free."[^2/24]

The AMA also battled Kennedy on his own turf, and in his favorite
medium, television. In a nationally televised address from Madison
Square Garden, where 20,000 elderly people cheered him on, Kennedy
argued for the passage of legislation that would extend Social Security to
cover hospital care of all the elderly. But Kennedy, a usually charismatic
speaker, fell flat, delivering one of the worst addresses of his career.
After the crowd cleared out, Dr. Edward R. Annis, the AMA's most
dynamic speaker, stood at the podium where Kennedy had been a few
hours earlier. The AMA had rented the hall---and even paid extra to
keep it from being cleaned---to film Annis delivering a rebuttal. In a
speech that was nationally broadcast the next night in a time slot purchased
by the AMA, Annis looked out over the empty seats and the
pennants, paper cups, and flyers that littered the floor. He then gave a
"hellfire and brimstone" speech staking out the AMA's unyielding opposition
to Kennedy's plan. Annis warned viewers, "The public is in danger
of being blitzed, brainwashed and bandwagoned. ... "[^2/25]

### The Johnson Juggernaut

The AMA and its allies succeeded in stymieing Kennedy during his
shortened term in office. But Kennedy's assassination, and the assumption
of power by Lyndon B. Johnson, changed everything. A master politician,
Johnson, more than Truman or Kennedy, knew how to whip
Congress into line. And when Johnson campaigned for president in
1964, he promised he would make Medicare a top priority. He won in a
landslide, and his coattails helped elect one of the most liberal, Democratic
Congresses ever. On the first day of his new term, he kept his campaign
promise by sending up Medicare as House Resolution No. 1. A
national health-insurance program for the elderly appeared to be inevitable.

The AMA stood fast in its opposition to Medicare, and offered an
alternative plan. In February 1965 Dr. Donovan Ward, the AMA's president,
and three other AMA officials presented their objections and their
plan in an executive hearing on Medicare at the invitation of the Ways
and Means Committee. Mills, the committee's chairman, was a friend of
the AMA who believed the financing of Social Security should not be
tampered with

"The American Medical Association opposes H.R. 1 as it opposed
the same legislation which was rejected by the last two Congresses," Ward
said. "It would represent a dangerous venture by the Federal Government
in the field of health care. ... Government regulation and control
which would be established under this bill is not compatible with good
medicine."[^2/26]

The sponsors of Medicare had hoped to tiptoe around the AMA by
simply excluding doctors from the legislation, making it a hospitalpayment
program only. But the AMA made hay of this fact. "We are
opposed to offering false promises to the unfortunate who do need help.
This bill would provide only a fraction of the care necessary in
any serious illness, a fact which many of our aged do not realize,"
Ward said. [^2/27]

The AMA proposed its alternative, Eldercare. For poor seniors only,
the plan covered hospital and doctor bills. Meanwhile, an AMA ally,
Representative Thomas W. Byrnes (R-Wis.), also jumped on the fact that
Medicare covered only hospital care. He introduced a bill allowing the
elderly to purchase private insurance to cover hospital and doctor bills
in a federally administered program. It was also a voluntary program.
General government revenues would pick up two thirds, and the elderly
would pick up the other third through deductions from their pension
checks.

Mills had put aside his reservations and signaled to the President
that he would go along after Johnson's huge victory. To everyone's surprise,
he sought a consensus by including a scrap from each major proposal
into a whole new program, and in the process, creating an even
more ambitious and far-reaching program than Medicare's sponsors had
dared to propose. The result was referred to as a "three-layer cake." Medicare
Part A, taken from H.R. 1, covered hospital costs. Medicare Part B,
borrowed from Byrnes, covered doctor bills. And Medicaid, fashioned
from the AMA, covered the poor. The President's point man on Medicare,
Wilbur J. Cohen, crowed: "In effect, Mills had taken the AMA's ammunition,
put it in the Republicans' guns, and blown both of them off
the map."[^2/28]

In a set of extraordinary circumstances, the AMA had lost. The
AMA was at the peak of its power--seven of every ten doctors belonged
to it, a higher percentage of doctors as members than ever before or
since. In defeat, the AMA would never wield quite as much power. But it
had learned about the value of money, the significance of working Congress,
the importance of staking out a position. And after the AMA's
leaders quelled a move by its members to boycott Medicare, it made sure
doctors would benefit from the new national program. Johnson, like
Truman, did not seek to reorganize health care, but simply to expand it.
Medicare became a pipeline of money to hospitals and doctors.

## THE FIFTH BATTLE

The AMA, still smarting from its defeat on Medicare, soon faced an even
more daunting challenge. United Auto Workers president Walter P.
Reuther renewed the campaign for national health insurance in a speech
to the American Public Health Association in November 1968. He said
the U.S. system was in a state of crisis, and announced a new Committee
for National Health Insurance would push for a government-financed
and -run program of universal health insurance. His call for reform
opened a floodgate of proposals. Politicians from conservative Republican
president Richard M. Nixon to liberal Democrat senator Edward M.
Kennedy echoed his declaration that a crisis faced the U.S. health-care
system. The rush to reform placed doctors and hospitals once again on
the defensive. [^2/29]

The AMA denied the system faced a crisis. It called the U.S. system
the best in the world and insisted that many of the health problems cited
by studies and experts were more likely the result of societal factors and
economics than the absence of medical treatment. The few gaps in the
system could be fixed, the AMA said, warning that frustration with rising
costs should not automatically lead to the scrapping of the existing
system.

To patch the cracks, the AMA offered a plan called Medicredit. It
would have given everyone under sixty-five tax credits, graduated from
100 percent for those who pay no taxes to 10 percent for those at the upper
bracket, to buy a private health-insurance plan. The AMA assigned
its lobbyists to round up legislators to back the plan. Within a year the
AMA published a list of ninety-five Medicredit sponsors in the House.
Two thirds of them got contributions from the AMA's political-action
committee for their campaign funds for the next election.[^2/30]

According to an official AMA history, Medicredit's acknowledgment
that the federal government has a legitimate role in the financing of
health care was a sharp break from the AMA's past. But the history also
admits, "No one in the AMA was so naive as to think that a Medicredit bill
would pass." It was little more than a bid to gain a seat at the negotiating
table.[^2/31]

At that table were two key players, Kennedy and Nixon. Kennedy,
who held the key chairmanship on the Labor and Public Welfare Subcommittee
on Health, became labor's chief sponsor for national health
legislation. Hints of presidential aspirations gave his position added
strength. Nixon, a pragmatist, faced the problem of fashioning a conservative
response in a liberal era.

Kennedy and Nixon agreed on fundamental problems: too many
Americans did not have access to health care, and those who did were
paying more but getting less for their health-care dollar. They expressed
concerns about the skyrocketing costs of health care. The Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, for example, showed that per capita
health spending had more than doubled to $270 in 1969 from $128 in
1960.

But Kennedy and Nixon responded with very different plans, sparking
a debate about the proper role of government in health care. Kennedy
proposed the Health Security Act to create what is now called a
tax-based "single-payer" system. It would wipe out private healthinsurance
companies and finance health care for everyone through Social
Security. Nixon offered the National Health Insurance Partnership,
a prototype of what today is "managed competition." It would preserve
private health-insurance firms, require companies to offer insurance to
employees, and restructure the delivery of care through prepaid group
practices called health-maintenance organizations, or HMOs. [^2/32]

In 1974 the timing seemed ripe. Both Nixon, to the dismay of most
of his cabinet, and Kennedy, to the outrage of labor, moved toward compromise.
They both sought to require employers to offer standardbenefit
insurance plans to employees, make the people pay out of
pocket, deductibles and copayments, and also require them to pay at
least $1,000 before covering catastrophic care. Both also accepted the
continued existence of insurance companies, although Nixon would
have them sell policies while Kennedy would have them administer a
federal system. Nixon would make participation by employees voluntary,
and Kennedy would make it mandatory. Nixon also would decentralize
the system by requiring states to administer it, while Kennedy would impose
federal control.[^2/33]

Although compromise seemed to be in the air, labor and the AMA
blasted Kennedy's proposal. Labor abandoned Kennedy and stayed with
the Health Security Act. The AMA reintroduced Medicredit and criticized
both Kennedy's and Nixon's efforts to restructure American health
care. The reform movement momentarily stalled with the start of impeachment
proceedings against Nixon. After he resigned, the new President,
Gerald R. Ford, started the ball rolling again, saying, "Why don't we
write---and I ask this in the greatest spirit of cooperation---a good health
bill on the statute books before Congress adjourns?"[^2/34]

### The Doctors' Dozen

Ways and Means chairman Mills took Ford's words to heart in August
1974. He whipped together a compromise plan in which employers and
employees would have to participate in a national program financed
through private insurance premiums; the poor, the self-employed, and
others would be covered in a state-run alternative program funded by
new general revenues, and catastrophic costs would be covered under a
federal program funded by a 0.4 percent hike in employer payroll tax.
1975.
The committee became a magnet for lobbyists and PAC contributions
from special interests with a stake in a national health-care system.
The AMA tapped its wealthy members to raise ample funds for its political
action committee, which gives money to the campaign funds of political
candidates. In 1974 the AMA's PAC set aside $25,000 strictly for
contributions to members of the Ways and Means Committee---a large
sum in those days. In 1973 and 1974 the PAC contributed more than $1
million to 245 federal candidates---an even larger sum. Half of the candidates
supported Medicredit and the other half were undeclared.[^2/35]

When Mills met with members of the committee to seek support for
his proposal, he found that what he once thought of as solid ground had
turned to quicksand. No coalition could form a clear majority, with labor
insisting on the single-payer plan and the AMA and other conservative
groups backing tax credits. The committee first took a vote on the AMA's
approach. It deadlocked at 12--12, with 7 Republicans and 5 southern
Democrats voting for the AMA's Medicredit plan.

That twelve-member bloc determined the fate of the Mills proposal.
The leader of the AMA's congressional sponsors and a key member of
the Ways and Means committee, Representative Joel T. Broyhill (R-Va.),
insisted that any health-care proposal had to win the support of the
AMA-led medical profession. After the committee split on several votes,
Mills realized that the twelve committee members wedded to the AMA
plan held the key to any future compromise. On August 21, 1974, Mills
gave up. "I think the members of the committee will agree with me that
we've done everything we can to bring about a consensus," he said. "We
don't have that consensus."[^2/36]
The AMA and labor were pleased. The AMA had locked up enough
votes to undermine the compromise. And labor had succeeded in delaying
consideration of what it perceived as a weaker program. Labor
looked to the 1974 elections, in which it predicted there would be a liberal
landslide in Congress, giving it a better chance of getting its preferred
program passed. They were right about the election: seventy-five
new Democrats backing a labor-supported health plan won, and fiftyfour
of the legislators who had supported the AMA plan lost or retired,
including Representative Broyhill.

After the election, AMA leaders feared that a national healthinsurance
plan looked even more likely to pass in 1975. Dr. Russell B.
Roth, the AMA leader, shifted the AMA's position to accept what appeared
to be the lesser of two evils. Rather than face a national healthcare
system, Roth said requiring employers to offer medical coverage to
workers "seems an acceptable alternative to our Medicredit approach."[^2/37]
At the AMA's December meeting, its delegates reluctantly went along: [^2/38]
Of the proposals on the table, the AMA's had changed the most.

Ironically, as 1975 opened, the future of a national health-care plan
dimmed. Mills left Congress in disgrace after being caught in an escapade
with an Argentine striptease artist, and Kennedy returned to
labor's fold, again sponsoring the single-payer Health Security Act. Dealing
with a worsening economy, Ford did not offer a health-care plan at
all. Instead, he slapped a moratorium on any new federal programs that
would create additional federal spending.

Meanwhile, unexpected roadblocks arose for the path for health legislation
in Congress. In the post-Watergate atmosphere of reform, Congress
changed its committee structure, triggering a dispute between
Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce. The committee chairmen
argued about which one would write the national health-insurance legislation.
After they failed to resolved their differences, each committee
held separate hearings and let the bill die. The moment had passed.[^2/39]

### The "Evils" of HMOs

The AMA also had to fight against attempts to restructure the way health
care was delivered during the 1970s. Reformers again sought to create a
more efficient system by pushing prepaid group practices, once again
threatening the private independent fee-for-service practice. The AMA
leaped to its protection and succeeded in slowing and limiting the
change.[^2/40]

The AMA had long opposed prepaid group practice, or what it
called "the evils of contract practice." The AMA believed that doctors
were exploited in systems that paid physicians a fixed fee for each patient,
rather than a fee for each service. And the AMA's distrust remained
despite the camouflage of a new name: health-maintenance organizations,
or HMOs.

President Nixon introduced HMOs in his first plan for the healthcare
system. Taking and recasting a liberal reform, Nixon proposed
HMOs as a middle path between labor's centralized system and the feefor-service
system. Unlike a centralized system, HMOs would not require
a new government bureaucracy. And at the same time, HMOs would reverse
the "illogical incentive" of fee for service to reward doctors and hospitals
for providing more services and to penalize them for returning patients
to health.[^2/41] Nixon called for planning grants and loan guarantees,
hoping to increase the number of HMOs to 1,700 in 1976 from thirty
in 1971.

Kennedy also favored the development of HMOs, and he proposed
a more ambitious $5.1 billion aid package to rapidly expand the number
of them. But the AMA and conservatives together beat back the program.
Nixon scaled back his request, and the AMA, which accepted "limited,
experimental" HMOs, urged defeat of Kennedy's proposal. What
finally passed was an experimental pilot program for about 100 HMOs
costing $325 million over five years. The AMA had succeeded in restraining
the growth of HMOs, even if it could not stop them altogether. By
1978 just 168 HMOs were in operation, and only fifty-two met federal
requirements---a far cry from Nixon's goal of 1,700.

### The Last Gasp

National health insurance had one last gasp during the 1970s. Jimmy
Carter's election to the presidency in 1976 seemed to brighten the prospects
for national health insurance since he had campaigned for it to
court labor's support. The aura of inevitability returned. Yet when Carter
assumed office, he shifted gears and declared that health-care costs had
to be slowed first. Instead of national health insurance, he proposed limiting
hospital-cost increases to 9 percent in 1978 and increasingly smaller
percentages until a new payment system was created.[^2/42]

The AMA staked out its compromise position on reform. Among the
key elements were standard benefits, an employer mandate to offer employees
health insurance, a patient's freedom of choice of benefit plan
and physician, subsidies for the poor to buy private insurance, and a pluralistic
system of health-care delivery. The principles were contained in a
bill before both houses of Congress.[^2/43]

"We recognize that the present system is not perfect," Dr. William C.
Felch, chairman of the AMA's Council on Legislation, told a government
hearing on national health insurance. "But any modifications must be
accomplished without radical restructure that would undermine or
sacrifice the great strengths of our system which far outweigh any imperfections."[^2/44]

By September 1979 no longer willing to wait for Carter, Kennedy introduced
the Health Care for All Americans Act, which resembled his
compromise plan. Developed by a labor coalition, the plan would insure
everyone for basic medical services. It attempted to combine the benefits
of competition with the controls of regulation. It set both national and
state budgets for health-care spending, but allowed five consortia of insurance
companies and providers to compete for business. But it was so
complex that some joked it was a Rube Goldberg design.

Carter responded by introducing a more limited plan. It included
only care for catastrophes, but required that everyone be covered. Among
its equally confusing features were a requirement that employers offer
their workers health insurance meeting federally established standards,
and the merger of Medicare and Medicaid into one program called
HealthCare. Carter also sought to use market competition in his plan by
allowing private insurers to sell both employer and HealthCare plans.

Neither plan passed. The rivalry between Kennedy and Carter
spilled into the Democratic primaries as both ran for President. Carter
won the first round, promising "to kick Kennedy's ass," and then doing it.
But Carter lost the second round, going down to defeat at the hands of
the former AMA pitchman, Ronald Reagan. Under Reagan, national
health insurance lay dormant. The AMA celebrated its survival of another
bout of inevitability.

## THE SIXTH BATTLE

In January 1989 a proposal for a government-run system of national
health insurance appeared for the first time since the 1970s. National
health insurance was a dead issue during the Reagan years, but with the
start of the new Bush Administration a small but growing group of liberal
doctors sought to revive it. In its opening shot, the 1,500-member
Physicians for a National Health Program declared: "Our health-care
system is failing. Tens of millions of people are uninsured, costs are skyrocketing,
and the bureaucracy is expanding. ... It is time for basic
change in American medicine."[^2/45]

Every authority on the nation's health was struck by the same paradox:
costs for care continued to soar, accounting for 12 percent and more
of the gross national product, while at the same time the number of people
without health insurance was some 37 million and increasing. The
growing problems of cost and access led to the creation of a host of
committees---including a business-labor commission headed nominally
by three former presidents, and a bipartisan congressional committee---to figure out how to fix a system that appeared to be badly broken.
The liberal doctors behind the national health-insurance proposal
thought their timing was right. The paradox facing the United States
does not exist in other Western industrialized countries because they
have national health-care systems. Only the United States and South
Africa do not. Americans were becoming more disenchanted with the
U.S. system. Perhaps it was time for the government to step in, as it had in
Canada. In Canada the federal and provincial governments collect taxes
to finance health care, eliminating the need for private insurance companies,
and negotiate budgets for spending on health care directly with
doctors.

In March 1989 a widely quoted poll sponsored by a pharmaceutical
firm found that 60 percent of U.S. citizens said they preferred the Canadian
health-care system over the one in the United States.[^2/46] The liberal
doctors' proposal for a single-payer program similar to Canada's was
published in the _New England Journal of Medicine_, accompanied by an editorial
declaring: "Universal Health Insurance: Its Time Has Come."[^2/47]

The conservative doctors at the American Medical Association
viewed the turn of events with alarm. Already, the AMA was in a fierce
battle with Congress over a plan, borrowed from the Canadian system, to
limit the growth of physician pay under Medicare. Now a proposal to
adopt the entire structure of the Canadian system was gaining ground.
In June, when delegates met for the AMA's annual meeting, they kicked
off a counteroffensive.

They endorsed a new AMA Board report that echoed Dr. Morris
Fishbein's assessment of half a century earlier: "It is not an overstatement
to emphasize that American medicine is at a crossroads, with one
road leading to government controls, rationing of care, and other objectionable
results inherent in a nationalized system, and the other leading
to a strengthened U.S. system preserving all of the advantages that mark
the American system as being the best in the world."[^2/48]

### The AMA's Reacts

The AMA adopted its well-worn strategy of fighting major change to the
health system, which organized medicine had spent millions of dollars
and mighty effort to help shape. The AMA delegates, who regularly
renew their opposition to "socialism," passed a resolution directing
AMA staff to run a public-relations campaign attacking the flaws in
the Canadian system.[^2/49] They also endorsed the board's campaign---"Strengthening the U.S. Health Care System"---and authorized a budget
of up to $2.5 million for a campaign to run at least through 1990.
Dr. James H. Sammons, the AMA's top executive, said, "I wouldn't argue
with anybody who says that $2.5 \[million\] is just a beginning."[^2/50]

Dr. James S. Todd, then the AMA's second-in-command, replied
to the _New England Journal_'s editorial, claiming, "It's Time for Universal
Access, Not Universal Insurance." He compared the prospects of a
government-run health program to the hapless Post Office, and questioned
the "siren song of foreign programs."[^2/51]

As in the past, the AMA sought to identify alternatives to a major restructuring
of the system. To patch the system's cracks, the AMA turned
to its past policies. The keystone was requiring employers to offer workers
a standard health-insurance package, an idea the AMA had adopted
in the 1970s. To cover the uninsured, the AMA called for expanding the
coverage of the Medicaid program through national minimum standards
and a plan to develop state risk pools for the uninsured and
medically uninsurable. The AMA developed those proposals after unemployment
and loss of insurance soared in the recession of 1982. Since
the 1930s, the AMA had urged the government to pay for the health care
of the poor.

The AMA still considered health care a privilege, not a right. In an
attempt to make points with the public, and to soften this position, the
AMA's leaders announced with great fanfare that the delegates would be
voting on a patients' Bill of Rights at its December 1989 meeting in
Honolulu. But to the leaders' embarrassment, the delegates balked and
failed to ratify the Bill of Rights.[^2/52] However, the delegates finally passed a
version of the Bill of Rights, which said patients have a right to "the availability
of care," after a lengthy debate at their June 1990 meeting [^2/53]

The delegates did agree with the leadership on one major issue.
They recommended that the counteroffensive against a Canadian-style
system be repackaged and promoted, so that in future debates physicians
will be able to present and identify with a positive and proactive
health-care program."[^2/54]

### The "New" AMA's "New" Plan

In February 1990 Dr. James H. Sammons abruptly resigned as AMA executive
vice president in the wake of a scandal, and Dr. James S. Todd
took his place. Todd immediately went to work fashioning a "new AMA"
that was less confrontational, more willing to compromise, and eager to
end the AMA's isolation from other groups. One of the first incarnations
of this "new AMA" was the renaming of its battle plan as "Health Access
America."

The AMA held a press conference in Washington on March 7, 1990,
to unveil the sixteen-point plan. "It's a double package, something we can
take to Congress and the American people," said president Dr. Alan R.
Nelson. He added the AMA's real purpose: "We've got to put a merciful
end to all those preposterous discussions about a national health system
such as England's or a national health-insurance system like Canada's."[^2/55]

If the AMA wanted a place at the negotiating table over the future of
American health care, it had to offer a plan. Other proposals had begun
appearing almost monthly. In January 1989 the National Leadership
Commission on Health Reform suggested in broad outlines a system
relying on employer-provided health insurance. In August 1989 the
American Academy of Pediatrics released its plan for universal health
care. In September 1989 the AFL-CIO announced it was resuming its
drive for a national health plan, although it would not push any one specific
plan, and the American Academy of Family Physicians and the
American Society of Internal Medicine had released their plans. Just
days before the AMA's announcement, the bipartisan Pepper Committee
created by Congress approved a recommendation for requiring employers
to either provide insurance to workers or pay into a governmentrun
pool, commonly known as a "play-or-pay" plan.

Not surprisingly, the ideas contained in Health Access America tilted
toward the interests of physicians. By requiring employers to cover
workers and a broad expansion of Medicaid, the plan made sure doctors
would be paid for their work. By opposing total reliance on HMOs or
budget caps to control costs, it sought to avoid reductions in physician
pay. And by insisting on changing laws to make it harder for patients to
sue doctors accused of malpractice, it sought to remove a nagging form
of physician accountability. The plan also would strengthen the AMA by
making it the negotiator between doctors and the government.

Not all doctors bought the AMA line. The American College of Physicians,
the country's largest specialty group, representing 77,000 internal
medicine specialists, demonstrated a breach in the AMA's vision of
physician unity. Dr. John R. Ball, ACP executive vice president, said his
group had quit the AMA's sessions on reform. "The ACP attempted to
get the AMA to speak more bluntly of the physician's responsibility," Ball
said, but there was no "substantial discussion" of the M.D.'s role in assuring
the quality of care or containing costs. Another ACP official derided
the AMA's plan as a "Band-Aid solution."[^2/56]

### Influencing the Inevitable

Throughout 1991 the AMA tried to position itself as a proponent of
change, not an obstacle. Todd met with old AMA enemies and surprised
them by his conciliatory approach and a demeanor far less arrogant than
that of Sammons. The AMA president, in a rare occurrence, met with
the president of the AFL-CIO. They agreed that Medicaid should be expanded
and that an employer-based approach appeared more politically
feasible than a single-payer plan.

But the AMA continued warring on the Canadian system. In April it
released a poll that it said showed most Americans wanted only a repair
job, not a replacement, of the health-care system. The leading expert on
health-care polls, Dr. Robert Blendon of Harvard, said the AMA's survey
stacked the deck by asking leading questions. He also said the AMA poll
was contradicted by eight other polls that found that more than 60 percent
of Americans wanted a national health-insurance plan.[^2/57]

In May 1991 the AMA sought to solidify its new image. In specialtheme
issues _JAMA_ published thirteen different health-care-reform
plans, and the AMA's nine specialty journals ran another fifty-two articles
on reform and the uninsured. Dr. George D. Lundberg, editor in
chief of the AMA's journals, editorialized that it was no longer acceptable
for so many people to be uninsured. He said the system had to change:
"An aura of inevitability is upon us."[^2/58]

Todd proclaimed that the AMA was forging the beginnings of a national
consensus on health care. "We want to talk to people and not reject
anything out of hand. Changes are inevitable, and it is never wise to oppose
the inevitable. Our goal is to achieve a position where we can influence
legislation and proposals early in their development," he said.[^2/59]

The AMA's push fanned the flames of political change, and John
Sununu, George Bush's chief of staff, saw health care as little more than
a Democratic campaign issue for the presidential election in 1992.
Sununu called AMA's leaders on the carpet for their agitation for health
reform. But the AMA did not back down, and it proved right about the
voters' interest in health care. Harris Wofford, an underdog Democratic
candidate for an open senate seat in Pennsylvania, pounded away at the
need for reform and won. (The AMA's political action committee, of
course, contributed to the campaign of his Republican opponent.)[^2/60]

By 1992 the concern over the ailing health-care system had reached
epidemic proportions, and nearly every expert and interest group, and
most politicians, offered a cure. A week before the first presidential primary,
even President Bush presented a plan. Lundberg, in the second
_JAMA_ dedicated to reform, counted fifty-seven national and state legislative
proposals. He urged AMA members to continue to push for reform,
despite unavoidable trade-offs.

As if to goad doctors into getting on board with the AMA's strategy,
Lundberg wrote an editorial titled "The Aura of Inevitability Intensifies."
In it, like Fishbein before him, Lundberg exploited the fears of the
AMA doctors: "If business continues as usual without major change (in
the health-care system), I predict a meltdown by 1996. At that point, in a
worst-case scenario, the Congress would panic and nationalize the entire
health-care industry; they can do that." And, to scare his physicianreaders
even more, he said doctors would be "conscripted as government
employees."[^2/61]

Meanwhile the AMA's chief executive continued to mend fences by
appearing before the Group Health Association of America, the country's
largest HMO organization, and burying the hatchet. "While the
AMA has long recognized the existence of HMOs, we have been slow in
recognizing and accepting the benefits of HMOs," Todd said.[^2/62]

But while Todd was carrying olive branches to former foes, the
American College of Physicians released its own version of health-care
reform, which was far different from the AMA's. "Health care is a fundamental
right, not an economic privilege," ACP chief executive Ball said.
Added ACP president Dr. Willis C. Maddrey, "With this proposal, our
physicians acknowledge that the health-care system is so broken that
something much greater than incremental reform must be done to
fix it."

In its plan, the ACP was inviting the government to take a greater
role in health care. The ACP called for a national budget to limit healthcare
costs; the AMA had always said this would cause rationing of care.[^2/63]
At its December 1992 meeting, the AMA rejected a national budget and
stuck with letting "the market" control costs. The ACP, in an unusual
move, took a shot at the AMA, saying it was disappointed. "Health-care
reform begins with cost control, and cost control begins with the commitment
to living under a budget," Ball said.[^2/64] AMA delegates declared the
ACP shot "inaccurate, unprofessional, and insulting."[^2/65]

But the signs were clear. Unlike in the five previous battles over
health-care reform, the AMA could not keep the House of Medicine together.
Not only had the ACP gone its own way, but the American Academy
of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics
appeared to be at odds with the AMA.

### Preparing for the Inevitable

The election of Bill Clinton put the first Democrat in the White House in
a dozen years and gave the country the first president in nearly a generation
who had campaigned for health-care reform. He emphasized how
serious he was by putting his political career on the line by appointing his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to head the task force that would create
his reform proposal. He promised to unveil a proposal in 100 days after
his inauguration, but missed his deadline by months.

Lundberg, in an editorial, declared, "The Aura of Inevitability Becomes
Incarnate."[^2/66] As in the past, the AMA gradually moved from a
conciliatory stance toward the Clintons to a harder line against true reform.
In the early stages of the process, the AMA sought to follow the
strategy Todd had earlier described: it would not oppose inevitable
change, but it would do everything it could to shape the proposals being
developed by the new Administration. To do this, the AMA dipped into
its ample financial reserves to run $3 million worth of advertising in major
national newspapers and magazines as part of its $10 million, fouryear
Health Access America campaign. And the AMA's political action
committee spent $6.3 million in the 1991--92 election cycle, more than
other health groups or specialinterest of any kind.[^2/67]

But much to the AMA's chagrin, Mrs. Clinton did not include the
AMA or any other special-interest group among the 538 members of her
Health Care Task Force. And the AMA publicly whined about being kept
from the table. And for the first months of the Clinton administration,
the AMA and the Clintons publicly tested each other. Mrs. Clinton
hinted that certain special-interest groups were greedy, and the AMA reacted
with offense. The AMA accused the Clintons of locking out doctors,
and the Clintons assured the country that doctors were involved.

To greet Clinton's proposal, the AMA planned a three-pronged attack.
First it would deploy its lobbyists in its $8.7 million Washington operation
to buttonhole politicians to explain the AMA's angle on the plan.
Within a week of the announcement, the AMA would mail its analysis to
the nation's 718,000 doctors and medical students and to the media. And
the AMA told its members to urge their patients to contact their representatives.

The AMA had fought fiercely in the past, and Todd pledged to do no
less during his watch: "We will mount the most vigorous congressional
effort in our history, fighting for what is best for patients and physicians
alike."[^2/68]

The AMA showed it could mobilize doctors by staging a "lobbying
day" in Washington in March 1993. Hundreds of members went to Capitol
Hill to meet with their representatives, and the AMA invited politicians
to speak to an audience of doctors. Responding were all the major
health-care players, from Vice President Al Gore to Representative Fortney
"Pete" Stark (D-Calif.), the frequent AMA antagonist and chairman
of the Ways and Means Committee health panel.

The AMA sent representatives to meet with the Health Care Task
Force several times, and just before Clinton abandoned his reform-plan
deadline, Todd wrote a boastful note to AMA's trustees: "It would appear
that the President may need us more than we need him to get his healthsystem
reform plan through the Congress. The negotiating leverage
should be ours."[^2/69]

In June, Mrs. Clinton addressed the AMA at its annual meeting, and
she pressed every button she could to evoke an emotional response
among doctors to win them over to her side. She praised them, and
promised change in malpractice laws and federal clinic regulations. As a
high-ranking AMA official said after her speech, "I couldn't have written
it better myself."

When Clinton's rough draft was leaked in September, a diplomatic
James Todd said he was "cautiously optimistic," and AMA publicrelations
people smiled and said that the AMA was happy with about 80
percent of the plan. The AMA had won a key battle when Clinton rejected
a single-payer plan as an option. Instead he offered a vaguely
defined program called "managed competition," which borrows many
ideas of the old Nixon plan. Clinton proposed to build on the existing
employer-based health-insurance system, emphasizing giant HMOs that
compete with each other as well as continuing to offer traditional fee-forservice
medicine at higher prices. But issues dear to the AMA's heart
remained unresolved: whether there would be malpractice reform,
health-spending caps, and cuts in physician pay under Medicare.

The AMA's conciliatory tone abruptly changed following Clinton's
September 22 televised address to Congress on his health plan. In its
$700,000 mailing on September 24 to all the nation's doctors and medical
students, the AMA rolled out its artillery and blasted away. The language
of the package, actually an appeal for an AMA battle fund, left
little doubt about where the AMA stood: "We have serious reservations
about the President's proposal. ... We are troubled by the degree of
centralized regulation. ... We are also deeply concerned that the means
to finance reform are unclear."

The AMA's rejection of key provisions of the Clinton plan stood out
by the way the package described the opposition. The AMA "unequivocally"
and "staunchly" opposes a national health-spending budget and a
national board that would set the budget. It "strongly opposes" a singlepayer
health system. And it "is adamantly opposed" to restrictions on
fee-for-service practice.

The cooperative and conciliatory AMA had given way to the confrontational
AMA. The AMA appeared to be following its old path,
switching into high gear to battle in Congress what it could not change in
conference with the Clinton administration. As much as the AMA has
claimed it has transformed into a friendlier, more flexible "new" AMA, as
Clinton's campaign for health reform began in fall 1993, it sounded like
the "old" AMA of hardball politics.

The delegates at the AMA's December 1993 meeting further eroded
the image of a "new" AMA. Leading the charge back to the past was
Dr. Edward R. Annis, who was the AMA's chief spokesman in its battle
against Medicare three decades earlier. "The AMA is going hand-inhand
with the Clinton Administration," Annis said in his first speech to
the House since he was AMA president in 1963--64. "The Administration
is determined to dictate and control the way American medicine is
practiced."[^2/70]

His rhetoric led conservative delegates to attempt to rescind AMA
support of employer mandates, the foundation of the AMA's Health
Access America plan. But AMA leaders, fearing the political fallout
from such a move, worked out a compromise. The resolution, which the
House adopted, says the AMA supports one of three options: 1) requiring
employers to pay for their workers' health insurance, 2) requiring
each individual to buy health insurance, or 3) a combination of the two.
In one vote, the delegates had nearly severed one of the few links between
the AMA plan and Clinton's proposal.

The partially successful assault on the AMA's own policy by a bloc of
conservative members showed again how out of touch delegates are with
the mainstream of physicians. The AMA released a poll it had commissioned
showing that 70 percent of U.S. doctors support an employer
mandate. Dr. Robert Graham, chief executive of the American Academy
of Family Physicians, attended the meeting as a delegate. He said, "The
AMA leadership really believes reform is important, but the rank and file
\[delegates\] would kill it without qualm."[^2/71]

A week after the AMA meeting, Clinton hosted a pep rally in the Old
Executive Office Building next to the White House. There representatives
from ten doctors' organizations expressed their support for
Clinton's health-care plan. "The presence of these physicians here
debunks the notion that the plan we have presented is some sort of biggovernment
bureaucratic plan that erodes the doctor-patient relationship,"
Clinton said.

In February 1994 the AMA suffered another body blow at the hands
of the independent American College of Surgeons. Dr. David D. Murray,
chairman of the ACS Board of Regents, representing 55,000 members,
told the House Committee on Education and Labor that it would support
a single-payer, Canadian-style system because it provided "the best
assurances that patients would be able to seek care from any doctor of
their choice ... can probably be made more simple and more workable
administratively."[^2/72]

Support by such a prominent group for an idea that the AMA long
had tarred as no less than un-American heartened the many single-payer
supporters in Congress while it upset the self-styled reformers at the
AMA. Dr. Robert E. McAfee, the AMAs president and a surgeon himself,
expressed astonishment at the surgeons' position. He warned that a
single-payer system would take "medical decisions out of the hands of
doctors and their patients and (give] that power to faceless government
bureaucrats and bottom-line-oriented MBAs." He said single-payer medicine
would result in rationing of care and in new technology not being
made available.[^2/73] It was the sort of propaganda against "socialized medicine"
that made the AMA famous.

The stands by the surgeons and the others---representing more than
350,000 physicians, far more than the AMA's membership---again demonstrated
that if there is one Voice of Medicine, it was not the AMA. As
the director of the Washington office of the American Academy of Family
Physicians put it: "The AMA doesn't speak for the entire medical community."[^2/74]
