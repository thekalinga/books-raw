# License to Make Money: Turning Medicare into a Cash Cow[^3/0]

In the century-long struggle
over national health insurance, Medicare is the only major political battle
that the AMA lost. But now doctors are hooked on Medicare, the federal
program that helps 35 million elderly and disabled people pay their hospital
and doctor bills. That's because even in defeat, the AMA won a victory
for doctors. The price the AMA demanded for not boycotting
Medicare was the government's agreement to allow doctors to set their
own fees. Critics refer to this arrangement as the federal government's
"open checkbook."

Soon after the enactment of Medicare in 1965, the AMA's opposition
turned into an obsession with keeping the checkbook open. That is
not surprising. Medicare transformed the way medical care is delivered
and paid for, and with private insurance is the driving force in the healthcare
system today. Medicare also has changed the way doctors practice
medicine. About a third of a doctor's earnings, on average, come from
Medicare. Even though many doctors complain that Medicare pays too
little, it has helped make many doctors wealthy.

But the personal financial gains that doctors have made through
Medicare have come at the expense of the very people who are supposed
to be helped by the federal health program: the elderly. Senior citizens'
share of hospital and doctor bills have risen so much that they are spending
as much out-of-pocket on health care now as they did before Medicare.
And as any worker can tell from looking at the Medicare deductions
and taxes from his paycheck, the burden on taxpayers continues to grow.

For the past three decades, the AMA has battled to protect doctors'
earnings under Medicare in the face of government attempts to curb the
skyrocketing costs. Each time Congress has considered measures to slow
Medicare expenses, and specifically to rein in doctors' pay, the AMA has
gone to war. Physician income is the AMA's bottom line. And its obsession
with Medicare illustrates how the AMA is not that different from a
plumbers' union. As Princeton economist Uwe E. Reinhardt, one of the
leading experts on physician pay, puts it, "The AMA is a trade union. I
know they hate the word 'trade union,' but I mean let's face it, that's what
they are. And the overwhelming preoccupation is the professional freedom
and the economic achievement of their members."[^3/1]

The AMA has been largely successful in its goal. Total earnings of
U.S. physicians make them the envy of doctors around the world. During
the 1980s, professionals such as lawyers and accountants also saw their
incomes rise rapidly. Yet as one study of doctors' incomes concluded,
"Physicians remain the most highly compensated professionals, and
their absolute income gain in the 1980s exceeded that of any other profession."[^3/2]

## RAGS TO RICHES

Doctors were not always as wealthy or influential as they are today. Most
doctors fell into the lower end of the middle class when the AMA was
founded in 1847. A few doctors rose to wealth and prominence, but most
were simply not rich. In the 1850s, for example, a Massachusetts doctor
earned an average of $600 per year, while a typical annual budget for a
family of five in New York was about $540, according to Paul Starr, who
traced the rise of the medical profession in _The Social Transformation of
American Medicine_.[^3/3] He cited an article from that era complaining that
medicine was "the most despised of all the professions." When a young
man chose to become a doctor, the article said, "the feeling among the
majority of his cultivated friends is that he has thrown himself away."

Fifty years later, doctors had made gains but still weren't rich. A doctor's
yearly income was in the range of the $1,000 made by federal employees
and the $759 made by ministers, and about double the $540
made by the average worker. But by the 1920s, doctors' earnings were rising
much faster than the cost of living, and a 1928 AMA survey found
doctors' average annual income was $6,354. During the Depression, doctors,
like everyone else, saw their incomes drop. But the gap between
doctors and most workers continued to widen: doctors on average made
about $4,000, four times as much as the $990 average earned by all
workers.

The long, slow road to prosperity closely followed the medical profession's
success in persuading society to give it a licensed monopoly. For
most of America's history, doctors and their fees were either regulated or
subject to truly competitive markets. When America was a colony, governors
played a major role in setting doctor fees. After the United States
won independence, states continued licensing doctors. In the 1830s and
1840s, states repealed licensing laws. That unleashed the competitive
market. Soon just about anyone could declare himself a doctor, and
many people did. These "irregular" practitioners created fierce competition
for the "regular" doctors, who followed a style of practice they said
was based on science. For most of the 1800s, the regulars had too many
competitors and too few paying patients.[^3/4]

A year after the state of New York repealed its physician licensing
law, the regulars founded the AMA, primarily to upgrade medicaleducation
standards, but also to improve the image, status, and incomes
of doctors. In the AMA's first Code of Ethics, one section called for the
posting of fee bills listing the range of fees for particular services to discourage
price-cutting among physicians. Another section warned
wealthy physicians not to give free advice to affluent patients because
that made it harder for poorer doctors to collect from their rich patients.
The Code did little to reduce competition.[^3/5]

The AMA took other steps to advance the interests of doctors. It
campaigned against the irregulars, calling them quacks; it fought against
hospitals and dispensaries for the poor, which it accused of stealing paying
patients, and it lobbied for licensing laws and improved educational
standards. By the 1870s states began reestablishing physician licensing
laws, but it wasn't until after the turn of the century that the AMA's drive
for education reform was successful. The AMA played a major role in
setting the rules for admittance to medical school, education and training,
licensing, and even hospital privileges. The number of medical
schools dramatically shrank. Fewer schools meant fewer graduates. That
meant fewer competitors. And doctor incomes began to rise.[^3/6]

### Ensuring Doctors' Pay

When the Great Depression hit in the 1930s, it became clear that many
people could not afford to pay their doctor bills. An answer to that problem
was private health insurance, which the AMA reluctantly accepted
only after making sure doctors remained in control. In fact, it was doctors
associated with the California Medical Association, an AMA affiliate, who
created the first Blue Shield plan in the late 1930s as an alternative to a
state-run health insurance program. Other doctor-controlled private insurance
Blue Shield plans soon followed in other states. The plans created
an important precedent by allowing doctors to set their fees. The
plans could limit their payments to doctors, but allowed doctors to bill
patients for the difference between the plans' payments and the doctors'
usual fees. Doctors called this practice "balance billing"; critics tarred it
"extra billing."

After World War II, the private health-insurance industry boomed,
aided partially by government intervention. To control postwar inflation,
the government froze wages but allowed companies to compensate employees
with health benefits and exempted those benefits from taxes. As
a result, most contracts between management and labor unions included
company payment for workers' health insurance. The increased demand
for medical care coincided with a shortage of physicians. Not surprisingly,
doctors' incomes began to rise, at a rate of 5.9 percent a year, twice
the consumer price index.[^3/7] By 1965 doctors'average annual earnings hit
nearly $30,000, about five times the median average income.[^3/8]

## MAKING MEDICARE PAY

Since the 1920s the AMA has balked at the prospect of the government
running a national health program. Its leaders worried that the government
would try to tell doctors how to do their jobs and feared it would set
physicians' fees. At the heart of the AMA's battle against "socialized medicine"
was its determination to protect the independence and economic
standing of doctors.[^3/9]

Bitterness and anger characterized the AMA's eight-year war beginning
in 1957 against health-care legislation that ultimately became Medicare.
The AMA refused to accept the need for it, even though studies
showed that senior citizens were increasingly having a hard time paying
for health care and an even more difficult time finding health insurance.
Medicare was designed to make sure the elderly would continue to have
access to health care at an affordable price.

On July 29, 1965, the day after Congress enacted Medicare and the
day before Johnson signed the bill into law, the President met with eleven
AMA leaders at the White House. Many doctors talked openly about boycotting
Medicare. One right-wing doctors' group loudly urged physicians
to shut down the new program. Without the doctors' cooperation,
Medicare would flop, Johnson and his staff knew. The President wasn't
about to let that happen.

Johnson used all his wiles to impress and ingratiate himself with the
AMA doctors. He relied on his folksiness, his presence, and a ten-point
memo written by his health aide, Wilbur J. Cohen, to placate the doctors.
He promised no government interference in physicians' practices, and
invited the AMA to help write Medicare's rules. And he opened the government
checkbook. Medicare would become a conduit for cash to doctors
and hospitals.

Johnson allowed doctors to set their own fees under Medicare. The
plan would pay "reasonable charges" based on what doctors customarily
charged and what the prevailing charges were in the area; and charges
would be updated each year. But no one had determined what was a
customary and prevailing rate, leaving doctors free to create the baseline
for future increases. And they did that by hiking their fees. As a result of
the higher fees and the increased number of patients in the first year of
Medicare in 1966, the average physician's earnings rose 11 percent to its
highest level ever, $32,170.[^3/10]

Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.), the House Ways and Means
Committee chairman who fashioned Medicare, also gave doctors a financial
bone. Retired AMA lobbyist James W. Foristel recalled, "Right after
Representative Mills gave in to President Johnson on Medicare, he called
in eight AMA trustees to give them the bad news. 'Here's what I can do for
you,' Wilbur said. "I'll write into the law a provision that will allow physicians
to direct bill for their services, rather than being forced to accept
the Medicare payment as payment in full. "[^3/11]

That provision borrowed the practice of physician extra billing from
the doctor-controlled Blue Shield plans. And it meant doctors could
choose to be paid by the government directly---called "taking assignment"---or
to collect from the patient, who would then seek reimbursement
from the government. If doctors took assignment and billed the
government, they knew the government would pay, but they had to accept
the government-established "reasonable charge" as full payment. If
doctors billed the patient, they depended on the patient's ability to pay,
but could charge more than the government would pay.

Doctors said they sought the privilege of extra billing because they
thought the government should be in the business only of helping
seniors who could not pay their bills. Repeatedly, the AMA sought to include
a "means test" in federal health insurance to determine whether a
person needed the help in the first place. The AMA maintained it was
the right of the elderly to pay their doctors as much money as they
wanted, and extra billing allowed this right to be exercised.

But Medicare did not give the elderly a free ride. They had to pay the
first $50 and 20 percent of the rest. If their doctors billed the government,
that was all they paid. If the doctors billed the patient, the sky was
the limit on what the patient might have to pay.

After meeting with Johnson, the AMA's leaders took the golden bait
and urged their members to comply with the law. In October 1965 the
AMA held an emergency meeting. Its members were hostile to Medicare
and cool to their own leaders. By the end of the two-day meeting,
however, the AMA membership decided to go along with Medicare. It
slowly dawned on them that Medicare may be government-run, bureaucratic,
and even a tad socialistic, but it was an unparalleled opportunity.

The next summer, the AMA held its annual convention just days before
the official start of Medicare on July 1, 1966. The House of Delegates
passed a notable resolution: it recommended AMA members to bill
Medicare patients, not the government-freeing doctors to charge whatever
the traffic would bear. [^3/12]

### Unreasonable costs and Charges

In February 1970 the Senate Finance Committee released a stunning report,
which opened: "The Medicare and Medicaid programs are in
serious financial trouble."[^3/13] Medicare had started just four years earlier,
the report said, but the cost of paying hospitals and physicians had
soared beyond expectations and belief. Already Congress had to increase
Medicare taxes 25 percent to meet skyrocketing hospital costs. And the
government had to hike the premium paid by senior citizens 33 percent
to cover the rapidly rising doctors' bills.

The report blasted the way the government set physicians' "reasonable
charges" under Medicare. The law said charges should not be
higher than what local insurance companies paid. But that was what was
happening, according to the report's survey of eight common procedures
performed on the elderly in 1968. A comparison of the maximum
Blue Shield payments for the procedures with the average Medicare
charges produced astonishing differences. In Illinois, for example, the
most the Blue Shield plan would pay for cataract surgery was $165; Medicare
paid on the average $444, nearly three times as much. In Florida,
Blue Shield paid at most $117 for a hernia operation, for which Medicare
paid an average of $255, more than twice as much. And in Texas, Blue
Shield's top payment for a gallbladder operation was $95, while Medicare's
average payout was $303, triple the amount.

"No one can say for certain how much money has been overpaid as a
result of the failure to apply the statutory limitation on 'reasonable
charges,'" the report said. But it added, "It is safe to say Medicare has
spent many hundreds of millions of dollars more than otherwise would
have been required."

### Overpaying for Medicare

Worse, the report disclosed that in 1968 the government paid more than
$25,000 in Medicare reimbursements to at least 4,300 individual practitioners
and 900 physician groups. And Medicare payments exceeded
$100,000 to at least 68 solo practitioners. The staff examined the records
and created profiles on the doctors who were raking in the most. "Hundreds
of the payment profiles indicate that the physician involved might
be abusing the program," the report charged. "For example, we found
many general practitioners each paid $15,000, $20,000, or more for laboratory
services. We found large payments being made for what appear
to be inordinate numbers of injections. In many cases we found what is
apparently overvisiting and gang-visiting of patients in hospitals and
nursing homes."

The report described this practice: "A physician may see as many as
30, 40, and 50 patients a day in the same facility---regardless of whether
the visit is medically necessary or whether any service is furnished. The
physician in many cases charges his full fee for each patient, billing Medicare
for as much as $300 or $400 for one sweep through a nursing home."

In a congressional hearing on the report, AMA president Dr. Gerald
D. Dorman showed a film to legislators to display physician involvement
in Medicaid and Medicare. The film followed one doctor working in a
poor Chicago neighborhood and another one in a rural Kentucky
county. The country doctor said he kept his clinic open twenty-four
hours a day, 365 days a year. He said every day he saw more than 100 patients,
and sometimes as many as 200. After the film, Senator Russell B.
Long (D-La.), who had originally opposed Medicare, spoke.

"May I just make one comment on that film? I think that the kind of
thing we just saw in Kentucky is a disgrace," Long said. "Based on the figures
he gave, these people are getting about three minutes attention
each. I don't think anybody, I don't care if he's Louis Pasteur, can give anybody
much treatment if he is only giving them three minutes attention."
He added, "We are willing to pay for the care patients are getting. We are
not willing to pay for the care patients are not getting. We don't feel we
ought to have to pay for a half hour's attention when the patient only got
three minutes'attention."

One of Medicare's original sponsors, Senator Clinton P. Anderson
(D-N.M.), told the AMA officials: "The key to solving these problems is
the physician. He is the common element of control in all aspects of
health care. He literally and figuratively has his finger on the pulse
of these areas of difficulty and their potential solution."[^3/14]

## APPLYING THE BRAKES

In the decade that followed the hearing, three different presidents trieda
mix of refinements, fee freezes, peer-review systems, and complicated
regulatory schemes to curb costs, all to no avail. The AMA managed to
defend the basic way Medicare paid doctors---a fee for each service, updating
what the doctor customarily charged or what the prevailing rate
was in the area. For most of the 1970s the government continued to
pump money to hospitals and doctors to fulfill its primary goal: to help
people get health care, not to control costs.

That all changed with the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, a conservative
Republican who had opposed Medicare in the 1960s. Previously
presidents had placed health concerns above costs concerns in their approach
to Medicare. Reagan reversed the order. Ironically, organized
medicine had hailed Reagan as its champion during his campaign for
President. But the AMA leaders' joy turned to apprehension as his
budget-cutters began wielding an ax.

For the first time in its history, Medicare became a target for budget
cuts. The AMA and other health-care providers found themselves facing
an unexpected united front: Reagan's ideologically conservative budget
officials teamed up with the liberal-Democratic legislators who controlled
the tax-writing Ways and Means subcommittee on health. The
White House wanted to cut the budget, and Congress wanted to protect
the elderly. That left hospitals and doctors targets for budget savings.

The budget-cutters first took on hospitals, responsible for nearly
two-thirds of Medicare costs. When Medicare was first enacted, the government
paid hospitals their costs and an added amount to allow the hospitals
to expand their facilities to meet the increased number of patients.
President Jimmy Carter had sought to impose a capon hospital costs, but
hospital and AMA lobbyists persuaded Congress to block his initiative.
By 1980 Medicare costs had soared.

To nearly everyone's surprise, a major overhaul of Medicare hospital
payment sped through Congress and the bureaucracy in a matter of
months, not years. The new system was called Diagnostic Related
Groups, or more commonly DRGs, which averaged costs for several procedures
into one charge. This made budgeting of costs easier and more
predictable. It went into effect in September 1983.

Next came the doctors' turn under the knife. Most people believed
their fees were too high, particularly for the elderly and disabled covered
by Medicare. In 1983, according to a report in the _New England Journal of
Medicine_, 80 percent of doctor bills exceeded Medicare's "reasonable"
rates. That resulted in the elderly paying $2.5 billion extra for physician
services. Indeed, the elderly were being hit hard, the report said: Medicare
beneficiaries paid more than half of physician charges through premiums,
additional insurance, deductibles, and extra billing. [^3/15]

But revamping Medicare payments to doctors did not come as easily
as it did for hospitals. A struggle ensued between 1983 and 1989. Nearly
all of the AMA's long-held and treasured notions about how doctors
make a living were questioned. The AMA became obsessed with Medicare
during the 1980s, as shown by its record of its official communications
with the federal government. During the 1981--82 session of
Congress, about a quarter of the AMA's communications dealt with Medicare.
By the 1989--90 session, more than one-half did. [^3/16]

## FIGHTING THE FREEZE

The AMA often attempts to preempt or prevent government action by
recommending a voluntary approach be taken by doctors. In 1983 the
organization could feel the hot breath of government panting down doctors'
necks. Government experts were projecting that rising hospital and
doctor bills would bankrupt Medicare in a decade. As a way of getting
those costs under control, Congress began eyeing doctor bills paid by
Medicare.

On the eve of an AMA conference in February 1984 that would discuss
the future of Medicare among other things, Dr. James H. Sammons,
the AMA's chief executive, returned _USA Today_ reporter Steven Findlay's
call. Findlay later recalled he asked what the AMA was prepared to do.
Sammons "blurted out that the AMA would call on physicians to voluntarily
freeze their fees for six months or a year. He assured Findlay that
the Board of Trustees would approve of the plan. "It's time we (doctors)
helped get the economy of the country back on its feet," he told
Findlay. [^3/17]

On the day the interview appeared on the front page of _USA Today_,
the board met and, true to Sammons' prediction, approved the call for a
one-year voluntary freeze. The AMA's PR apparatus hastily arranged a
press conference for the rest of the news media. In a few hours the board
members put the best face they could on the new policy.

"It is a sincere attempt on the part of the AMA to participate in the
solution rather than contribute to the rapid escalation of the cost of
health care in our country," said Dr. Frank J. Jirka, Jr., the AMA's president
and one of the few Democrats ever to make it to the top in the conservative
doctors' group. "We felt that at this particular time in history,
when we have some really depressed conditions in this country, that it is
incumbent on us as physicians to reduce some of these rising costs." The
board chairman, Dr. John J. Coury, predicted that most physicians would
comply with the AMA call. "I'm not a gambler," he said, "but I'm willing
to bet that 85 percent to 90 percent of the physicians of this country will
participate."[^3/18]

Critics of the AMA and physicians in general took a different view.
They all noted that the timing of the call for a freeze coincided with a
movement in Congress to tighten the regulations on how Medicare
would pay for physician fees. Members of Congress were discussing,
among other things, a bill that would end extra billing by requiring
"mandatory assignment." That is, the bill would make doctors accept the
government's reimbursement as full payment for treating Medicare payments.
AMA officials reviled this notion as "public-utility regulation of
medicine" and predicted that as many as 60 percent of the doctors accepting
assignment voluntarily would drop out. That would force many
Medicare patients to find new doctors and could cripple the whole
system.

Another suggestion was to apply the new payment system developed
for hospitals to doctors---in other words, create diagnostic related groups
(DRGs) that would carry a price tag that the government would pay up
front. That way, if doctors could do it for less, they made a bigger profit.
The AMA rejected this notion as too complicated and unworkable. It
pointed out that the listing for medical procedures contained at least
7,000 different codes, making it nearly impossible to create usable DRG
categories. And a third way was a government-imposed freeze on the fees
doctors could charge for treating Medicare patients. Reagan had told the
AMA he would seek a fee freeze the year before, when he addressed the
AMA's annual meeting. [^3/19] The AMA opposed any mandatory government
policy.

Among the skeptics of the AMA's voluntary fee freeze was House
Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-111.), who was pushing
legislation creating mandatory assignment. He said the AMA's call for a
voluntary fee freeze showed that the "AMA agrees that doctors are
charging Medicare patients too much." He added that Congress had
squeezed hospitals and hit beneficiaries with Medicare cuts, and it was
now time to reject the notion that "it is not all right to restrict doctors'
fees."[^3/20] Representative Andrew Jacobs, Jr., (D-Ind.), chairman of Ways
and Means Subcommittee on Health, derided the AMA's fee freeze, calling
it a "New Year's resolution" that doctors would not follow. He earned
the lasting enmity of the AMA by pushing for mandatory assignment
anda government-imposed freeze.[^3/21]

### War Threatened

Sammons warned the Reagan administration and Congress if they continued
to push mandatory assignment they would have a war on their
hands. Doctors revived talk from the 1960s about boycotting Medicare,
leaving seniors and the disabled stranded. The AMA had flooded the
halls of Congress with doctors. In April 1984, on a voice vote, Congress
backed away from mandatory assignment for doctors under Medicare.
_American Medical News_ noted the defeat of mandatory assignment and
patted the AMA, its owner, on the back for its call for a voluntary fee
freeze. [^3/22]

But the Administration and Congress were determined to find savings
in Medicare doctor fees. And two months later, in June, Congress
enacted a fifteen-month freeze on Medicare doctor fees. The mandatory
fee freeze made doctors accept reimbursement from the government at
the rate they charged in July 1983. Congress also added inducements to
doctors to accept assignment of Medicare fees as a "participating physician."
The incentives included an earlier end to the fee freeze and a form
of free doctor advertising through a "participating-physicians" directory
the government would distribute to the public. The law also authorized
fines or a suspension from Medicare for "nonparticipating physicians"
with a pattern of increasing charges to Medicare patients during the
freeze. Doctors had until October 1, 1983, to decide if they would participate.

In September, Department of Health and Human Services secretary
Margaret M. Heckler, Senator Robert Dole (R-Kan.), Representative
Jacobs, and Cyril Brickfield, of the American Association for Retired
Persons, held a press conference to promote the new wrinkles in Medicare
physician payment. They wanted to call the problem to the attention
of the more than 30 million elderly and disabled citizens covered by
Medicare. Dole hailed the AMA, which, he said, could have been "a key
potential roadblock" to the Medicare reforms. Jacobs later recalled he
was stunned by the praise heaped on the AMA by Dole, Brickfield, and
Heckler. The AMA already had announced it was planning to file a suit to
block the freeze. [^3/23]

When the AMA disagrees with the government, it frequently goes to
court. A week after the press conference, the AMA sued the Department
of Health and Human Services, charging that the government-imposed
fee freeze was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection
clauses in the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments. The lawsuit complained
doctors were the only professionals whose fees were frozen to reduce
the federal budget deficit. It argued that the freeze denied senior
citizens the right to select their own doctors because it prevented them
from paying the higher fees doctors charged non-Medicare patients.
The suit also sought a delay in the program's October 1 start because doctors
did not get fee information as early as promised, making it difficult
for them to decide whether to become "participating physicians."

"As part of their lawsuit," Jacobs recalled later, "they had to file
against HHS secretary Margaret Heckler. She lived in Boston and
worked in Washington. Should they file it in Washington? Did they file it
in Boston? No, they filed it in Indianapolis. They went directly to my
mother's doctor and asked him to be one of the plaintiffs."[^3/24]

On April 18, 1985, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that
the AMA lacked standing to bring the issue to court because no patients
had been denied care as a result of the freeze. Backed by the courts, Congress
extended the freeze to May 1986 for participating physicians and
through the end of 1986 for nonparticipating physicians.

### Pump Up the Volume

The AMA, acting as the self-proclaimed leader of medicine, claimed a
big victory in holding the line on Medicare costs. And lots of rhetoric was
exchanged, but in the end it was shown that the freeze did not help consumers.
In fact, doctors found a way to outfox freezes implemented by
the AMA as well as by the government.

The AMA estimated that 73 percent of the physicians chose to comply
with its voluntary fee freeze. It said the average doctor's fees rose
5.5 percent, higher than the overall rate of inflation of 3.7 percent but
the lowest fee increase since the last government-imposed freeze on fees
in the early 1970s. As a result, the AMA declared its year-long freeze a
success. [^3/25]

Others were less laudatory. Government economist Daniel Ginsburg
said, "The fee freeze definitely inhibited price movement. But obviously
not all doctors felt obliged to go along with it." And some were plain critical.
Charles Inlander, executive director of the consumer group the People's
Medical Society, said, "The fact is that doctors' fees are rising at a 66
percent higher rate than inflation. That to me is not a great victory of
consumerism in this country. It shows that the medical profession has
a long way to go to bring their prices into the reality of the American
economy."[^3/26]

Research later showed decisively that neither the AMA's nor the government's
fee freeze had worked. One study examined Medicare spending
on doctors in four states between 1983 and 1986. It found, "By 1986,
Medicare and its beneficiaries were spending 29.5 percent more for physician
services than three years before. This amounted to a $132 increase
(per beneficiary), up from $450 annually in 1983 to $582 in 1986."[^3/27]

Why had the fee freeze failed? Simply, doctors did not want a pay
cut, and they found a way to actually increase their pay by increasing the
number of services they provided their patients. The study concluded,
however, "a real possibility" existed that doctors had responded to the
freeze just by increasing the number of services per patient. More services
meant more bills. More bills meant more Medicare spending. And
that meant the freeze did not cut into doctors'incomes.

Not all physicians had pumped up the volume, the study found.
Medicare spending increased disproportionately for surgery, radiology,
and special diagnostic tests, which together accounted for two-thirds of
the expenditure growth. Those services tended to be initiated by physicians
rather than patients, countering the argument that patients demanded
more services.

The authors drove home their conclusion by pointing out that
patients would not likely know how to determine whether it was appropriate
to undergo X rays and specialized tests, such as echocardiography
and cardiac monitoring. And, the study said, "It is also noteworthy that
increased surgical volume was observed frequently among those procedures
that are considered 'overpaid' relative to the physician effort involved
in performing them."

## PRESERVING FEE-FOR-SERVICE MEDICINE

During the mid-1980s the AMA had to make a choice about how it
wanted doctors to be paid. Medicare was under siege and on the brink of
bankruptcy. The AMA found itself fighting a two-front war: protecting
Medicare from budget cuts and protecting doctors' pay from layers of
regulations and restrictions. It also was struggling with an image problem,
as more and more people viewed doctors as greedy and avaricious.
AMA public-relations specialist Toba Cohen told _The Wall Street Journal_ in
1986, "If I could knock 'avarice' off the phrase 'greed and avarice,' that's
probably doing what I was hired to do."[^3/28]

Meanwhile, nearly everyone agreed, the inflationary system of paying
doctors under Medicare, which had made many a physician prosperous,
had to go. The old method of customary, prevailing, and reasonable
fees was no longer customary, prevailing, or reasonable. The system,
critics said, encouraged the growth of doctor charges and the volume of
services. It also sent the wrong signals to doctors in their decisions on
where to locate and what to specialize in. The system, which was based on
a series of updates of what doctors had charged in the past, favored surgeons
and specialists and slighted family doctors and pediatricians. It
also tended to favor the time a doctor spent conducting a procedure and
worked against the time a doctor spent with patients. And it was so complex,
layered by the government with regulations and modifications, that
it confused patients and doctors alike. [^3/29]

Even top AMA officials conceded that the way doctors were paid under
Medicare had to change. But the alternatives being bandied about in
Washington did not look promising to the AMA. All of them rejected the
AMA's preferred basis of payment: a fee for each service. Liberal Democrats,
such as Senator Edward M. Kennedy, continued to suggest imposing
the DRG payment system on doctors. Conservative Republicans, led
by the Reagan administration, still favored a type of payment known as
capitation. Under it, Medicare would pay doctors a yearly lump sum for
each patient, rather than a fee for each service. This system is widely used
in health-maintenance organizations. The AMA criticized that method
for using the profit motive to discourage proper treatment. Capitation
also resembled the contract practice the AMA had damned as unethical.

Given the alternatives, the AMA opted for a fee schedule, which
some of its affiliate state medical societies had used before Medicare. The
schedule would be based on a scale that placed "relative values" for each
service performed. For example, it would assign one value to an office
visit, and then rank that in relation to, say, a surgical procedure. The
ranking was supposed to be "budget neutral"; that is, it would not be
used to cut the amount of money the government set aside for Medicare.
And, most importantly, it would preserve the AMA's preferred method
of fee-for-service payments.

The other incentive for the AMA to opt for a fee schedule was that it
would also probably make the payment system more rational by basing it
on the effort, training, skill, and time it actually took a physician to do his
or her job rather than relying on the fees he or she had always charged.
This in theory would increase payments to family physicians and pediatricians---the
lowest-paid doctors---and lower the payments to surgeons
and other specialists---who were the highest paid.

## PAY ON A NEW SCALE

In 1986 Congress created a thirteen-member Physician Payment Review
Commission to advise lawmakers on how to reform the way Medicare
pays doctors. The first thing it did was reject DRGs and capitation as the
only payment methods for physicians. Instead, it endorsed the idea of
creating a fee schedule. The schedule would be based on the amount of
resources a doctor spent in effort and time to complete a procedure.
Then the scale would rank the procedures relative to each other. Hence
the schedule took on the unwieldy name, Resource-Based Relative Value
Scale, which was shortened to RB-RVS.[^3/30]

To create this device, the commission contracted with Harvard sociologist
William C. Hsiao. Hsiao in turn subcontracted with the AMA to
use its "masterfile," the nation's most complete list of doctors, and other
expertise. The AMA originally sought the contract, but the Justice Department
nixed its bid, noting possible antitrust problems. As a doctors'
organization, the AMA had potential conflicts of interest in creating a
Medicare physician fee schedule, the government lawyers warned. Two
years and $2.5 million later, Hsiao unveiled the first model RB-RVS. He
published the version initially in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ on
September 29, 1988, and a month later in the _Journal of the American Medical
Association_. [^3/31]

The long-awaited study got a chilly reception. Dr. James S. Todd, the
AMA's second-in-command, expressed the AMA's ambivalent view in an
editorial. The scale, he conceded, "provided an acceptable alternative to
such dubious schemes as diagnostic related groups for physicians and
mandatory capitation." But now the AMA had to evaluate the scale's true
impact, whether it could be "translated into the cold, hard realities of
Medicare policy."[^3/32]

Hsiao was undaunted. "The RB-RVS could provide a fair and equitable
approach to compensating physicians for the services they provide,"
he wrote in _JAMA_. "We believe that RB-RVS could also enhance
cost-effective medical care and ameliorate the manpower shortage in
some primary-care specialties."[^3/33] Hsiao also said at a press conference,
"The playing field is tilted against office and hospital visits and time
spent with patients---not just for internists and family physicians but
across all specialties. Physicians are much more generously rewarded for
diagnostic tests and surgery."[^3/34]

The Physician Payment Review Commission struggled with many issues
raised by a national fee schedule, including such fine points as
whether allowances should be made for the differences in the cost of living
found, say, in Los Angeles vs. Paris, Texas. About a year and a half
into the commission's deliberations, Representative Fortney "Pete" Stark
(D-Calif.) and Representative Willis D. Gradison, Jr. (R-Ohio), of the
Ways and Means health panel, sent a letter complimenting the commission
for its work on geographic variations, but asked how the schedule
would hold down the Medicare costs for doctors' services.

"That put a much more difficult issue on our agenda," recalled commission
member Thomas E. Reardon, a doctor from Portland and an
AMA Board member. "We began to look at ways to do that. And that is
when ETs came up.[^3/35]

### Lowering the Volume

The Physician Payment Review Commission had a problem. It had embraced
fee-for-service as a basis for paying doctors in its new fee schedule.
But, as medical economists had long pointed out, fee-for-service
encouraged doctors to perform more services. And studies showed that
doctors, when confronted with the Medicare fee freeze, had responded
by simply requiring more patient visits and ordering more clinical tests.
In other words, they increased the volume of service to make up for lost
income. The commission began studying ways to encourage doctors to
perform only appropriate services, to cut out unnecessary and marginal
procedures.

The AMA offered its suggestions: change the laws to

l) make medical
malpractice lawsuits harder to file and the awards to victims smaller,

2) begin studies of what it called practice parameters (guidelines for
treatment), and

3) free doctors from antitrust laws.

The AMA insists that
fear of malpractice lawsuits leads many doctors to practice "defensive
medicine," that is, to conduct tests of marginal value simply to avoid
being sued. The AMA also pushed studies of practice parameters to
create guidelines on appropriate treatments and care.

The commission acknowledged these problems, but it instead looked
north and east for a way to control costs. It examined the way doctors
were paid in British Columbia and Quebec as well as in Germany, which
in 1985 had undergone a major reform. The commission came away
with a budgetary device known as "expenditure targets."[^3/36] The targets
were quickly dubbed ETs in a nod to the popular movie E.T., about an
extraterrestrial alien who comes to earth and befriends a little boy.

ETs were designed as a carrot-and-stick for doctors. Each year the
government would set targets as a goal for the increase in Medicare payments
to doctors. If the growth of doctors' expenses stayed under the
targets, the government would reward physicians by setting higher targets
the next year. But if the doctors' expenses exceeded the targets, the
government would lower the next years' targets to recoup the excess.
Another problem for the new fee schedule arose. If doctors thought
the Medicare fees were not high enough, they could simply pass on the
additional cost to their patients through extra billing. The representatives
of senior-citizen groups on the commission especially worried
about this problem. But commission members representing doctors argued
that doctors needed the ability to bill beyond Medicare's set fees,
which they said were too low. The commission heatedly debated whether
the fee schedule should simply ban extra billing.

At the end of the debate, the commission settled on a reform package
that was described as a "three-legged stool." One leg created a new,
fairer fee schedule for doctors, the RB-RVS. A second leg protected
seniors by putting a cap on the extra amount a doctor could charge them.
And the third leg was ETs, which sought to bring skyrocketing doctor
costs back to earth.[^3/37]

### Medicines Schism

The commission's proposal posed a great challenge to the AMA. At its
interim meeting in Dallas in December 1988, the AMA and about two
dozen specialty societies debated Hsiao's fee schedule. Because the
schedule rated the value of different work, it pitted specialist against
generalist, surgeon against family practitioner, doctor against doctor.
But the AMA managed to keep all the participants together, stressing the
need for doctors to speak with one voice in the process of reforming
Medicare. Members of the Physician Payment Review Commission all
complimented the AMA's diplomatic abilities in keeping medicine together.
Reardon played a key role in persuading the AMA and the specialty
societies to compromise. By the end of the meeting, organized
medicine supported the use of a relative value scale---with refinements,
of course---but rejected proposals to limit extra billing and to impose
ET s.[^3/38]

One major specialty association, however, boycotted the AMA meeting.
The American College of Surgeons had from the start opposed the
AMA's decision to support the switch from historical-based charges
(usual, customary, and prevailing) to a resource-based relative value
scale. The reason was clear: surgeons stood to lose the most from any fee
schedule derived from such a scale.

On February 7, 1989, the American College of Surgeons held a rare
Washington press conference to announce its proposals for physicianpayment
reform. The statement, read by Dr. Paul Ebert, the College's director,
did not make front-page news in the general press, but it shook
the House of Medicine: "At the heart of our new comprehensive plan is
a public commitment from the American College of Surgeons, the surgical
specialty societies, and their more than 85,000 members, to work directly
with Congress ... to reach an agreement on a broad range of
physician-payment goals that can be implemented in an orderly manner."
Key among its proposals was an acceptance of ETs as long as Congress
set up a specific target for surgeons, separate from the target for
other physicians.

In other words the surgeons had broken with the rest of organized
medicine to cut a separate deal with Congress. "Those of us in surgery
believe that it is impossible to effectively and efficiently address the volume
issue across the entire spectrum of medical services," Ebert said.
The college instead proposed having its own ETs in "an attempt to address
the issue of increased volume of services exclusively within the
scope of surgical specialty."[^3/39]

The defection of the surgeons was a big blow to the AMA. The College
of Surgeons had undermined the AMA's position that physicians
and specialty groups were unified in opposing ETs. An AMA official lamented,
"The surgeons made ETs a viable legislative and political issue."
It also gave Representative Stark the upper hand in the debate, allowing
him to use the "divide and conquer" approach to dealing with medicine.[^3/40]

## THE SHOWDOWN

In March 1989 Stark launched a series of hearings on the "three-legged"
payment reform devised by the Physician Payment Review Commission.
Stark, chairman of the health subcommittee of the budget-conscious,
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, made his goal clear at
the outset: "The fundamental problem is that Medicare gives doctors
a blank check. The more services they provide, the more they earn
whether or not the services are needed. Payment reforın must correct
this perverse incentive."

The government blank check had to stretch further every year, Stark
complained. In 1989 Medicare spending on doctor services soared
16 percent, far above the rate of inflation. In the previous five years,
Medicare spending on doctor services alone more than doubled to $28
billion. "We cannot continue to pass these cost increases on to the elderly
for their 25 percent \[share of the tab\] or to the taxpayers at large for the
approximately 75 percent they are paying," Stark said.[^3/41]

The increasing financial burden on the elderly, one of the nation's
largest voting blocs, particularly worried Congress. The premiums
seniors paid to cover their share of Medicare's doctor services had nearly
doubled in five years, and in the previous decade their out-of-pocket
costs had nearly tripled. Seniors were paying 15 percent of their income
for medical care, the same that they paid when Medicare began in
1966.[^3/42]

Why were Medicare payments to doctors going up so quickly? Inflation,
expensive new technologies, and an aging population figured in.
But studies also traced a major cause right back to the doctors. They were
increasing the volume of their services to patients: more office visits,
more diagnostic tests, more surgical procedures, and, of course, more
bills. Dr. Phillip R. Lee, of the Physician Payment Review Commission,
testified, "Some studies suggest in some areas as many as 20 to 30 percent
of the procedures performed are either unnecessary or of marginal benefit.
If we could eliminate or reduce those, we could save all the money
we need to finance Medicare and still have some left for other things that
need to be done."[^3/43]

The AMA's vice-chairman, Dr. Joseph T. Painter, assured Stark that
the AMA supported one leg of the stool: the creation of a new fee
schedule. But the AMA vigorously objected to the other two legs: the
limit on doctors' extra billing of patients and the spending goals of ETs.
Painter focused the AMA's attack on ETs, which Lee's commission had
designed specifically as an incentive to discourage unnecessary procedures.
Painter said ETs "may appear to be a painless way to hold down
expenditures, but it must be recognized for what it is, an implicit system
to ration care."

"Why is it rationing?" challenged Stark. "All we are suggesting is that
you go back at the end of the year among yourselves and say, 'Guys, we
spent too much. It doesn't have to be rationing. You all would say that
when you don't get as much money as you want, but you could also reduce
your fees, couldn't you, and come to the target? That doesn't have to
deny quality service. \[But\] that is the AMA's position: if we don't get what
we want, we won't treat people."[^3/44]

On June 14 Stark's subcommittee approved the package in an 8--3
vote. It contained the fee schedule, with the the automatic ETs and limits
to extra billing intact. The Bush administration signed on, seeking a way
to control Medicare costs. In fact, the top Bush health adviser, William L.
Roper, insisted on ETs. He much preferred paying doctors a set fee per
patient as a way of cutting the Medicare budget, and initially he was
lukewarm to a fee schedule. ETs made the fee schedule acceptable.[^3/45]

### The War on ETS

But the AMA mounted an effort to keep the government checkbook
open, even if it came at the expense of Medicare patients and taxpayers.
In a blunt, angry speech before the AMA's annual meeting on June 19,
1989, organized medicine's top doctor, Dr. James H. Sammons, declared
war on ETs, growling, "It's rationing, no matter what the hell they say."[^3/46]
ETs were one of the AMA's worst nightmares. When the AMA fought
Medicare in the 1960s, it warned that medical service would depend on
government budgets, not patients' needs, under "socialized medicine."
Twenty-five years later, no AMA leader would publicly brand ETs socialism.
But in his speech---and his last crusade as the AMA's chief---Sammons resurrected bitter memories of the battle over Medicare by
calling ETs "the biggest challenge facing the AMA since 1964."[^3/47]

To wage the war, Sammons activated the same kind of political and
public-relations machine that the AMA had used to successfully fight
proposals for national health care since the end of World War II. Sammons
unleashed the AMA's lobbyists in Washington and revved up the
PR apparatus in Chicago. He urged state and local medical societies to
join the battle and encouraged members to contact their representatives
and senators. The AMA set up a telephone at its annual meeting so doctors
could call their representatives in Washington. And the AMA's newspaper
ran a front-page appeal to doctors to contact their congressmen.[^3/48]

In Washington the AMA's lobbyists orchestrated more than a dozen
floor speeches by House members assailing ETs.[^3/49] Top AMA leaders visited
the White House to press their case with President Bush. Within six
weeks of Sammons' declaration, the AMA had sent three letters to every
member of Congress and several more to members of key House and
Senate committees. More noticeably, the AMA took out a full-page ad in
major newspapers aimed at Congress. The ad showed a picture of an
elderly woman and in large type asked: "How Do You Tell Someone on
Medicare She's an 'Expenditure Target'?"[^3/50]

The ad campaign created a storm of complaints. Labor unions and
seniors' groups blistered the AMA for conducting "a slick and dishonest
media campaign to protect their control of Medicare's golden goose,
while pretending to be acting for older Americans who are in fact being
squeezed by skyrocketing doctor charges."[^3/51] Gradison, the ranking Republican
on Stark's subcommittee, angrily attacked the ads as "heavyhanded"
and a "scare tactic" aimed at the elderly.[^3/52] Health and Human
Services secretary Louis Sullivan, an AMA member, called the ads "misleading"
and a "deception on the American public." Sullivan threw the
Bush administration's support behind ET5.[^3/53]

On June 28, 1989, the full Ways and Means Committee, after two
days of closed-door meetings, also approved the package, and carved out
a separate target for the surgeons. The AMA had few friends among the
committee's members. Indeed, Stark was the AMA's worst enemy. And
the ranking minority member, Gradison, declined to take any political
action committee contributions, closing an avenue for AMA influence.
After the vote, the AMA issued a statement criticizing the closed-door
meetings and accusing the committee of attempting to leave the "dirty
work"of rationing care in the hands of doctors. [^3/54]

The reform package still faced a rough road. First it had to pass the
health subcommittee of Representative Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.)
and then the full committee on Energy and Commerce in the House.
Then it had to go through the Medicare subcommittee of Senator Jay
Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) and the full Finance Committee in the Senate. Finally,
it had to pass the full House and Senate. The AMA's prospects for
knocking off ETs along the way looked good. The AMA had many more
friends on the Energy and Commerce and Senate Finance committees
than it had on the Ways and Means Committee.

On June 29 Waxman's health subcommittee passed a version of the
reform package---but, as the AMA had hoped, it had dropped ETs. Two
weeks later, the full Energy and Commerce Committee approved the
"two-legged" stool. Coincidentally, the AMA had honored Waxman as its
legislator of the year and gave him $5,000 in contributions in 1989.[^3/55]
But Waxman carefully distanced himself from the AMA's lobbying campaign
against ETs, telling _Congressional Quarterly_, "I hold my point of
view in spite of their ad campaign, not because of it."[^3/56]

By the fall, the reform package had moved to the Senate Finance
Subcommittee on Medicare, headed by Rockefeller. The senators had
two versions of the legislation to consider: Stark's bill with the ETs and
Waxman's without ETs. Rockefeller, and the subcommittees ranking Republican,
Senator Dave Durenberger of Minnesota, proved to be determined
to pass the reform package. The AMA pinned its hopes on its long
relationship with Durenberger, and did all it could to establish one with
Rockefeller.

When Durenberger went through a particularly tough election in
1988 because he faced charges of ethics violations, the AMA's political
action committee came to his aid, contributing $9,800 directly to his
campaign and spending another $134,527 independently to campaign
for him.[^3/57] The AMA also focused much energy on Rockefeller. Sammons
recounts how he paid several visits to Rockefeller and even chased
him to an underground shuttle to the Capitol, trying to persuade him to
junk ET s.[^3/58] And although the AMA's PAC had supported Rockefeller's
opponent in his last election, it gave Rockefeller two $1,000 contributions
in 1989 and another $5,000 in 1990 for his reelection campaign.[^3/59]

Rockefeller and Durenberger worked with the AMA to find an alternative
to ETs. Bush, they felt certain, would not sign a reform package
into law without some way to control the volume of physician services.
And they knew Stark would not give up ETs very easily, either. Finally, the
two senators came up with a compromise---MVPS, which stood for Medicare
Volume Performance Standards. The AMA signed on after Rockefeller
agreed to ensure that the new standard would require action by
Congress, would only be advisory, and would include a role for the AMA.

The _Congressional Quarterly_ noted, "The AMA had succeeded in
making 'expenditure target' a dirty word. Rockefeller went so far as to
disavow a committee briefing paper that used the name. 'We do not have
expenditure targets,' he insisted. We have volume performance standards,
and I insist that the words be changed.'

Over five days, Rockefeller led the drive to get Congress to pass Medicare
physician-payment reform in 1989. Other legislators, including
powerful congressional leaders, even told him to drop the entire reform
package. But he pushed on, often working late into the night to hammer
it out. Finally, in a late-night conference in November, ETs died. Rising
from the ashes were the MVPS, toughened to include a default mechanism
that would set the standards if Congress failed to act. MVPS did just
about everything ETs did, said the Physician Payment Review Commission
staff, and though more flexible had the same overall effect. Many in
Washington, and even other doctors' groups, saw MVPS as little more
than a face-saving deal for the AMA. But Sammons claimed victory:
"We are pleased the expenditure target proposal has been soundly rejected."[^3/60]

Dr. Phillip Lee, the payment-review-commission chairman, said, "I
think the AMA clearly has got to say they defeated expenditure targets,
and that's fine with me. But I think the volume performance standard
gives the clear message to doctors that we must do something about the
volume of unnecessary services now being provided." He added, "The
fundamental problem of the American system is that we gave an open
checkbook to hospitals and physicians. Now we are trying to close that
checkbook."[^3/61]

The federal government has begun phasing in Medicare physicianpayment
reforms, which will not be completely in place until 1996. But
early reports indicate the reforms have begun to work, although the
AMA has described the government's handling of the MVPS a disaster.
Extra billing has dropped dramatically, with fewer than a tenth of all doctor
bills under Medicare seeking additional payment from patients.[^3/62]
And the growth in doctors' Medicare expenses have come in lower than
the government-set targets.[^3/63]

### Charging More, Making More

Even if the AMA was not entirely successful in its battles over Medicarepayment
reform, it served a useful purpose for physicians. It bought
them time to make a bundle of money. While the AMA and Congress
argued over the best way to reform physician pay, doctors were busy
making up for any sacrifices they may have made under the governmentimposed
Medicare fee freeze by upping their fees faster than the rate of
inflation. Not surprisingly, their incomes also outraced inflation during
this time of playing catch-up.

In 1987 and 1988, AMA surveys found, doctors' average incomes
rose twice as fast as inflation. During the three years of the Medicare fee
freeze from 1983 to 1986, average net physician income rose to $119,500,
an increase of $15,000. In 1987 average income jumped to $132,300,
nearly matching the increase of the three previous years.

By 1990 doctors' average net income before taxes had risen to
$164,300, nearly twice what it was a decade before. Or, viewed another
way, three-quarters of the doctors made more than $90,000, and half of
them made more than $130,000. In 1992, the AMA reported, the average
doctor's income was $177,400, with surgeons making an average of
$244,600, internists $159,300, and family physicians at the bottom, making
$111,800.

The AMA acknowledges that doctors make much more than other
people, but it notes doctors require years of training, have specialized
skills, and make life-and-death judgments. Doctors graduate with huge
debts and start careers later in life. Most doctors work long hours and
face great stress. The AMA also pointed out that in real dollars, adjusted
for inflation, doctor incomes dipped slightly from 1989 to 1991.

Those arguments offer little comfort to most working people, who
make nowhere near the earnings of doctors but who must bear the brunt
of the cost of the nation's health care. From 1982 to 1990, the average
earnings for full-time employees grew from about $18,500 to $25,900, a
raise of 4.3 percent a year. During the same time, doctors' average income
rose from $98,000 to $164,000, or 6.6 percent a year. At the start of
the 1980s, a doctor earned about five times as much as the average
worker. By the end of the decade, a physician made six times as much.[^3/64]
