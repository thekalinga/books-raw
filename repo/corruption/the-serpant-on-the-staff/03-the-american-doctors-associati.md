# The American Doctors' Association: Looking After Medicine's Special Interests

Mere mention of the American
Medical Association's name elicits strong negative and positive reactions.
Some doctors boast that they never have been AMA members and would
never join that bunch of fossils. Others seem shocked anyone could think
that the AMA is anything less than a noble organization defending what
it is best for patient and doctor alike.

Some people hold AMA responsible for everything wrong with the
health-care system. Conspiracy theorists consider the AMA to be at the
center of all manner of plots to stifle alternative medicine, to keep cures
for cancer from the public, and to restrict the availability of health foods
and vitamins. Others think of the AMA as a group of medical elders
looking out after us, a kindly Big Doctor who removes the bad apples and
makes sure we get the latest medical miracles we have come to expect.
Some think the AMA stands for high principles, but has let the country
down by not campaigning for this cause or that. The author of one
popular book, for instance, berates the AMA for not taking on the diet
industry.

Despite the spirited reactions, most Americans have only the vaguest
idea what the American Medical Association actually does. The AMA is
much more and much less than what the public or even physicians think.

## HOW THE AMA AFFECTS OUR LIVES

In point of fact, the American Medical Association, the nation's largest
physician group, affects everyday life in America, often subtly. Your family
doctor's training as a medical student and resident was influenced by
standards the AMA helped shape. The AMA also has a hand in the doctor's
continuing education to maintain _his_ (though the number of female
doctors is rising, most are still men) skills and knowledge after he is in
practice. And the AMA's Principles of Medical Ethics and opinions from
the AMA's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs guide the doctor's behavior
as he cares for you.

The AMA is not the scientific authority it once was, when as recently
as a few decades ago it ran the largest clinical meetings in medicine and
operated its own laboratory. But it still has a huge impact on what physicians
and public know about medicine.

The AMA regularly issues positions on scientific matters and it conducts
public-health campaigns on such subjects as adolescent health,
domestic violence, and cholesterol reduction, typically with generous
support from drug companies, food companies, and other corporate
sponsors.

Perhaps the AMA's biggest influence is as a medical communicator.
To try to keep up with the latest medical developments, many harried
physicians rely on the _Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)_, a
weekly that has been published since 1883. With a 700,000 circulation, a
little over half of it in the United States, _JAMA_ is the largest general medical
journal in the world. Independent researchers who conduct the studies
that appear in medical periodicals consider the AMA's flagship
second only to the _New England Journal of Medicine_ in prestige. The AMA
also publishes ten medical specialty publications and a weekly newspaper,
_American Medical News_, which focuses on political and economic
developments in medicine. Each week, hungry for medical news, the
mass media publish or broadcast reports based on studies appearing in
_JAMA_ or its sister publications.

To make sure the AMA message and news from its publications are
not missed, the AMA has created a huge public relations apparatus.
Each week the PR staff sends news releases to 4,000 medical and science
journalists. It also dispatches video news releases based on studies in
_JAMA_ via satellite to 340 TV outlets; this information is often incorporated
into the broadcasts by the networks and local stations. And five days
a week, the AMA sends one-minute medical reports to 5,000 radio stations
via satellite or a toll-free phone number. In a joint project between
the AMA and NBC, American Medical Television produces medical information
aimed at physicians, but also can be viewed by lay people, on
cable television. The AMA publishes a number of consumer books on
health, such as the popular _American Medical Association Family Medical
Guide_.

It is fair to say that no one on the planet disseminates more words on
medicine to the profession and the public than the AMA. All of this influences
what our doctors do to diagnose and treat us and helps establish
what we expect from our physicians.

But the AMA's influence goes beyond mass communications into
hands-on medicine. If you are admitted into the hospital to have a baby
or undergo a bypass operation, or into a nursing home to recover from a
stroke, or into a hospice to live out your days, the AMA is there. From
birth through death, the AMA has a role, sanctioned by the U.S. government,
in setting standards in these institutions through the Joint Commission
on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, of which the
AMA is a major owner. The AMA determines the very language of medical
practice: when the doctor submits your bill to the insurance company
or government program for reimbursement, he or she writes down a
code number for whatever the problem may be from a book written by
the AMA.

## THE AMERICAN DOCTORS' ASSOCIATION

But the AMA is far more than a benign arbiter of medical standards and
a publisher of medical journals. Protection of the power, privilege, and
pocketbooks of physicians is the AMA's compass. The AMA's name is
pretentious and misleading, suggesting it is the guardian of all aspects of
medicine. It would be the equivalent of the American Bar Association
calling itself the American Justice Association. The American Medical
Association more appropriately should be called the American Doctors'
Association.

The AMA may accomplish things that help patients, but make no
mistake, it is a doctor-first organization. If you believe the AMA's claims
that your well-being as a patient is its first priority, then you probably believe
that Marcus Welby was a real doctor. The AMA did not evolve into
one of the wealthiest and most powerful political lobbies to protect our
rights as patients, or as consumers, the more assertive term doctors hate.
Rather, it has worked hard to look after physician income and interests.

It is because of the AMA, for instance, that consumers do not have
access to the National Practitioner Data Bank run by the U.S. government
that lists doctors who have committed malpractice, ethical
breaches, or crimes. The AMA argued that the public would misunderstand
this information, so it used its clout to keep the data away from us.

Doctors who perpetrated such wrongdoing historically had nothing
to fear from the AMA. Until recently, the AMA never disciplined its errant
members convicted of wrongdoing. In more of a symbolic move
than anything else, the AMA began purging its membership rolls of doctors
who had already lost their licenses, often years before. The AMA had
its reasons for this token gesture. It was trying to obtain government approval
for the profession to police itself, a responsibility doctors had
botched in the past.

## PRACTICING MEDICAL POLITICS

Some of the AMA's influence has been diminished in recent years as
other groups representing medical specialists have risen in importance.
But the AMA remains the premier practitioner of the art and science of
medical politics. The AMA is the proverbial 800-pound gorilla on Capitol
Hill.

No other group involved in health care---certainly none representing
consumers---can touch the AMA in terms of influence or access to
power brokers. The AMA pays dearly for this perk. It consistently outspends
not only all other medical groups but virtually all other special
interests.

American presidents seeking to make changes in the health system
without consulting the AMA do so at their own risk. If nothing else, the
AMA has great power as a spoiler, and can delay, derail, and destroy the
best-laid plans of presidents, legislators, and consumer activists. In his
address launching the Health Security Act, a reform on which he has
seemingly staked his presidency, Bill Clinton gave a nod to the AMA. It
was one of only two organizations he mentioned by name. He said nice
things about doctors, and made out the insurance companies and drug
manufacturers to be the villains in the health-care crisis. The Clinton administration
seemed to fathom that the best way to get the legislation
passed was to try to stay in the good graces of the AMA.

While Clinton said the system was badly in need of repair, the AMA
considers it only partially broken. For the AMA the glass is 85 percent
full. In the AMA mind, the 15 percent of the population without insurance
is the primary problem. The AMA says it wants a "pluralistic system,"
one offering several choices to consumers. But what it really means
is that it wants to preserve the fee-for-service component of the system in
which doctors are paid for each service rendered instead of fixed average
amounts per patient or some other financial arrangement.

One reason our system is in trouble is because the AMA historically
has seen health care as a privilege rather than a fundamental right for
Americans, a privilege all but the poor must pay for by themselves. At
least until now, Congress has gone along. In part because health care is
not a basic right, 38 million uninsured Americans do not have easy access
to doctors. They often delay seeking medical attention until they are extremely
sick, when their conditions are far more difficult and expensive
to treat.

Another reason we are in trouble is because doctors in the AMAendorsed
fee-for-service system have had few incentives to hold down
costs. As "captains" of the health-care team, physicians recommend
whether we undergo expensive hospitalizations and the latest in costly
high-tech testing and therapies. Because many physicians were not prudent,
they now have insurers and the government more closely monitoring
which medical services are provided to us. Doctors are not totally to
blame because we as consumers, with expectations fed by the media,
pressure physicians to give us the newest and best and to do everything
they can. For these and a cascade of other complex reasons, we are paying
the price as our nation's health-care bill soon will surpass $1 trillion,
consuming nearly a fifth of our Gross National Product. Americans
spend more per capita on health care than any other people in the world.

## THE SHRINKING VOICE OF MEDICINE

Hillary Rodham Clinton, "navigator" of the president's health plan,
came to make peace and common cause with the AMA at the physician
group's annual meeting in 1993. The AMA official who introduced her
attempted to demonstrate the group's authority and standing in American
life when he said the AMA represents 90 percent of the doctors in
the country and 100 percent of the patients.

Just as it is questionable that the AMA represents patients, its claim
to represent such a high proportion of the nation's estimated 650,000
doctors is dubious. AMA membership numbers are an important aid in
looking beyond the AMA's vast resources to evaluate its right to speak for
the profession and determine how much weight to give its positions.

Historically, the AMA has proclaimed itself to be the Voice of Medicine.
It is a catchy phrase, and one that fit in the 1960s when nearly threequarters
of American physicians were members. But with the defeat on
Medicare, rising dues, protests against its position on abortion, and other
factors, the AMA has experienced a significant drop in membership.

The only way the AMA can claim to represent 90 percent of physicians
is through its federation of medical specialty organizations. Most of
the doctors whom the AMA calls members have not chosen to belong directly
to the AMA. Instead, they are "members" because their specialty
society, such as the American College of Physicians, the American College
of Surgeons, and the American Academy of Family Physicians,
sends a single delegate to AMA meetings. The AMA counts these physicians
to boost its apparent membership and its prestige before Congress
and the public. But this is a desperate move by an association that cannot
compel doctors to become members and has considerable difficulty persuading
them to join voluntarily. The different specialty groups often are
warring factions whose own agendas and policies may not coincide with
those of the AMA's.

The AMA's real membership figures undermine its title as being the
Voice of Medicine. By its own reckoning the AMA has 41 percent "market
share"-its term for the proportion of eligible physicians who are
members. The AMA shouts that 90 percent of doctors are in its ranks,
but more meekly has set a goal by the turn of the century to have 50 percent
of physicians as members. And it will probably have trouble reaching
it.

### Membership Bloat

A closer examination shows that the AMA exaggerates its membership
figures to inflate its significance. Even the AMA does not have the audacity
to claim 576,000 members, which would be 90 percent of American
doctors. Rather, in media reports, in its ad campaigns aimed at decisionmakers,
and other forums, the AMA often trumpets that its membership
is "300,000 physicians strong." If there is strength in numbers, the AMA
is far weaker than its press releases would have us believe.

When asked its membership figures in summer 1993, the AMA said
it had 275,510 members. But closer examination reveals that the AMA
doctors its figures. Subtract 32,045 medical students, who pay a nominal
$20 a year in dues and who after all are not physicians, the membership
falls to 243,465 physician members, and market share dips to 38 percent
of physicians. Eliminate all physicians with reduced dues, such as residents,
young physicians and military doctors, and also dues-exempt retirees,
you are left with 153,268 members, just 24 percent of American
doctors who pay full annual dues of $420.

The proportion of full-dues-paying members is less than half of
what it was twenty years ago and a third of what it was thirty years ago.
The "powerful" AMA of the 1990s is a shadow of the AMA of the golden
age in the 1960s.

## HOW THE AMA IS ORGANIZED

The AMA is organized somewhat along the lines of federal and state governments.
At its center is the House of Delegates, its legislative branch,
often referred to as the House of Medicine. The House, the shorthand
name for this body, represents a variety of viewpoints within medicine.
Its delegates come from the fifty state medical societies and from the District
of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. Each of
these groups gets one vote per 1,000 members, and delegates are elected
by state or territorial societies' Houses of Delegates rather than by popular
vote.

The next-largest contingent of delegates comes from about eighty
medical specialty societies, such as the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the
American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. These delegates also are
not elected by popular vote, but are appointed by the medical specialty
groups' presidents or by their governing bodies. The smallest source of
delegates is the ten special sections representing such areas as hospital
medical staffs, medical schools, students, the Public Health Service, and
military physicians. The military and Public Health Service groups are
represented by their own surgeons general, while the other sections elect
their delegates.[^1/1] Within the House of Delegates, each specialty group
and each section gets a single vote.

The House of Delegates meets twice a year to vote on hundreds of
resolutions and reports prepared by the AMA's Board of Trustees and
various councils and committees, dealing with such topics as medical education,
science, ethics, public health, and delivery of medical services.
The annual meeting is held in Chicago, AMA headquarters city, in June,
and the interim or midyear meeting is held in December, typically in
some vacation spot, such as Honolulu, Las Vegas, or San Francisco.

The AMA House of Delegates meetings open on a Sunday with
pomp (an honor guard from a military group presents the colors),
prayer (from rotating religious groups), and pomposity (with speeches
by AMA leaders and sometimes a visiting dignitary). The politicking begins
before the opening session, with early-morning breakfasts by state
delegations or other groups. As the meeting wears on, various caucuses
huddle to promote their special interests, such as those of medical
schools, surgeons, or geographic areas. They hold hot dog lunches, cocktail
parties, luaus, Texas barbecues, wine-and-cheese tastings, and other
events to attract fellow delegates, whom they hope to persuade to vote
this way or that on particular issues. The New Jersey delegation hands
out boxes of saltwater taffy, the Washington delegation, apples, and the
Hawaii delegation has distributed orchids. These groups and others do
what they can to make friends and win votes for their favorite resolutions
and to lobby for their slate of candidates for the AMA Board of Trustees
or other posts. When expenditures on electioneering seemed to be getting
out of hand in the 1980s, the House formally urged restraint.

The House on Sunday and Monday breaks into "reference committees,"
comparable to congressional committees, which conduct hearings
at which any physician, AMA member or not, can speak. Outside groups,
such as the National Rifle Association and the AIDS activist group ACTUP,
sometimes are perinitted to express their opinions. The nine reference
committees, each dealing with specific areas such as legislation,
public health, and medical practice, typically are where issues are
debated in the greatest detail in hopes of influencing the delegatemembers
serving on the reference committees. The individual reference
committees, aided by AMA staff, then summarize the proceedings and
prepare recommendations on how the House of Delegates should vote.
Committees often work well into the night to reach a consensus and to
prepare their reports.[^1/2]

The full House of Delegates, consisting of about 440 members,
convenes Tuesday morning to begin voting on these issues and meets
until Thursday at annual meetings and Wednesday at interim meetings.
The House may adopt, reject, or refer back various pieces of business.
The meetings, directed by a parliamentarian known as the Speaker
of the House, go on for hours and hours, sometimes disposing of the
most serious issues without debate and other times endlessly discussing
where to place a comma or semicolon. The AMA likes to refer to this as
"democracy in action."

Positions taken at the meeting serve as AMA policy and help guide
the AMA's more than 1,200-member staff on what direction to take in its
day-to-day activities. AMA policy is not legally binding for society at
large, but has influenced state and federal lawmakers and the courts.

Most policies pushed through by delegates will languish as a matter
of record in the AMA _Policy Compendium_, a book listing several thousand
AMA policies, including its concern about destructive themes in rockand-roll
music, its questioning of the validity of studies that exclude
women, its misgivings about the high cost of medications, and its opposition
to the use of amphetamines as a weight-loss method. Every delegate
with a pet project or pet peeve has a chance to make it part of
the compendium. However, as large as it is, the AMA does not have the
time or money to give all these policies its full attention. Furthermore,
Dr. James S. Todd, who since 1990 has been AMA executive vice president,
the AMA term for chief executive, has stressed that the AMA now
has to do fewer things and to do them better.

One of the more important duties of the House is to elect the AMA's
powerful Board of Trustees, a sort of executive branch that includes the
AMA president. The AMA Board has the ultimate legal and financial responsibility
for the association, a not-for-profit organization that runs on
a $180-million-a-year budget and owns several for-profit subsidiaries involved
in investments, real estate, and other businesses. The Trustees
also travel regularly to Washington to present AMA views to Congress.
The board members speak to state and local medical societies, to the auxiliaries,
and to other related groups to keep them informed of new developments,
to make them feel connected to the national organization, and
to listen to their problems. Board members also explain AMA policies on
all sorts of issues, such as euthanasia or health reform, to the public
through the media. The board, which meets approximately every other
month, determines AMA policy when the House of Delegates is not in
session. The House later may affirm or reject board positions.

The board's real power rests with the chairman, who decides which
members carry out what duties. If a member is on the outs for some reason,
he or she may get few choice assignments. Chairmanship of the
board is often the route to becoming AMA president, a high-profile job
with little power, which entails making loads of speeches, making appointments
to committees, eating lots of chicken dinners, and collecting
about a $200,000-a-year stipend.

### The Delegates Are Not Representative

The AMA makes much of its "democratic" House, but its delegates are
not representative of the medical profession, as AMA research has
shown. Delegate positions tend to go to older, more established physicians
with the time and interest to devote to medical politics. But the
views of such delegates may not be those of the broader physician population.

The typical delegate is an office-based private practitioner at a time
when physicians increasingly are working for hospitals and healthmaintenance
organizations or in other nontraditional settings. The
AMA has student, resident, and young physician sections and has spots
on its board earmarked for students and residents. But, generally, younger
physicians who are building practices simply are unable to get involved.
As a result, the House of Delegates underrepresents today's
younger, more ethnically and racially diverse group of physicians, and
the greater number of female doctors.

Traditionally, minority groups within medicine have not felt welcome.
The House of Delegates did not have its first woman delegate until
1915. Dr. Nancy W. Dickey was elected the first woman to be a fullfledged
board member in 1989. For most of the AMA's history, blacks
effectively were kept out of the organization. Because of their race they
were barred from many county medical societies, and therefore from the
national group. The first African-American delegate did not enter the
House until 1949, and there have been few since. However, in 1993--94,
the AMA Board's chairman is an African-American, Dr. Lonnie R. Bristow.
He was the first African-American to be elected to the board in the
AMA's history, and is expected to be named president-elect in 1994.

Despite such changes, the House of Delegates remains an old boys'
club. The average delegate is a white male, nearing senior citizen status at
sixty-three, compared with the average physician, who is forty-five. AMA
statistics show other contrasts: 19 percent of today's physicians are
women vs. 7 percent of AMA delegates; just over 3 percent of American
physicians are African-American vs. under 1 percent of delegates; and
21 percent of American physicians are foreign graduates, vs. 3.3 percent
of AMA delegates.[^1/3]

### AMPAC: The Political Arm

Another important face of the AMA is AMPAC---American Medical Political
Action Committee---the conduit through which the AMA collects
and distributes money to politicians so it can have the access it needs to
make its views known and sway votes. AMPAC operates officially as a
separate organization, although there is overlap in doctors who move
back and forth from board membership in both. Doctors oriented toward
patient care or education traditionally have been distrustful of
AMPAC, feeling it does not represent the best side of medicine. Yet,
over the years, recent AMA leaders, including longtime chief executive
Dr. James H. Sammons, moved to the top of the organization's hierarchy,
having been active in AMPAC and its state affiliates.

AMPAC has won notoriety and fame as one of the biggest spenders
on politics and as an innovator in new means of influencing politicians.
The AMA and AMPAC always are at war with such public-interest
groups as Common Cause and Public Citizen, which seek to reform
campaign-finance laws to put stricter limits on monied interests. Common
Cause president Fred Wertheimer describes the AMA and AMPAC
as "arrogant."

AMPAC contributions provide a map for the issues that really matter
to the AMA. Like all special-interest groups seeking favors, AMPAC
channels funds to politicians in positions to advance its economic and
"reform" agenda. Over the years AMPAC has rewarded members of
Congress who voted for its favored legislation, and attempted to punish
those who voted against it. And the AMA and AMPAC have declared innumerable
wars against Congress when it was considering legislation
that would curb physician pay or would affect their prerogatives.

But rarely, if ever, has AMPAC put its money on the line for publichealth
matters, such as gun control, tobacco, or abortion. Harvard medical
student Joshua M. Sharfstein and his father, Dr. Steven S. Sharfstein,
examined whether AMPAC contributed money to politicians who supported
the AMA's stated positions on those three issues. The results, published
in the January 6 _New England Journal of Medicine_, showed that
AMPAC gave more money to representatives who opposed the AMA's
public health stands than it did to legislators who supported them. The
AMA criticized the Sharfstein study as too"narrow."

## MEDICINE'S PLUMMETING POLLS

In addition to the AMA's internal troubles, organized medicine is losing
public confidence. A 1993 AMA-sponsored opinion survey reported new
lows in the public perception of the image of the AMA and doctors in
general.

Mrs. Clinton alluded to the bad news in her speech to the AMA.
"Most doctors and other health-care professionals choose careers in
health and medicine because they want to help people," she said. "But
too often ... that motive is clouded by perceptions that doctors aren't
the same as they used to be, they are not doing what they used to do, they
don't care like they once did."

Furthermore, people do not trust the leaders of medicine as they
once did. In fact, polls show a dramatic drop in the proportion of people
who said they had a great deal of confidence in medical leaders: from 73
percent of those surveyed in 1966 to 33 percent in 1986.[^1/4] After Harvard
professor Robert J. Blendon reported that stunning downturn, the AMA
began asking people to rate the job the AMA is doing to help assure
quality medical care. The first five years of the survey recorded a gradual
decline in the AMA's combined good and excellent rating, from 59 percent
to 51 percent, while its poor rating doubled to 10 percent. But in
1993 the proportion who thought the AMA was doing a good or excellent
job plummeted to 43 percent, while those who thought it was doing
a poor job held fast at 10 percent.[^1/5]

Though most of the public probably would be hard-pressed to detail
the AMA's activities, in this poll, the organization continued to lose
ground in the public eye as a scientific and educational organization.
From 1989 to 1993, the survey asked people to say how reliable they believe
the AMA is as a source of information on health. More than half
think the AMA is _somewhat_ reliable---indicating more than a hint of
doubt or skepticism about the AMA as the house of medical experts.
More importantly, the AMA researchers found, the proportion of people
surveyed who said they believed the AMA was a _very_ reliable source of
information on health dropped from 31 percent to 23 percent.

### The Doctors' Image Is Declining

As the AMA's reputation has suffered, so has the image of physicians in
general. The vast majority of people consistently give high marks to their
own doctors, but they don't feel the same way about the medical profession.
This finding is comparable to the way the public feels about politicians:
they like their own representatives, but distrust Congress as a
whole.

Most people agree that doctors stay up-to-date on advances in medicine
and take a genuine interest in their patients. But the most recent results
from AMA polls found than 71 percent think doctors keep their
patients in the waiting room too long, about 60 percent think doctors do
not involve patients enough in deciding on treatment, and 44 percent
believe doctors act like they are better than other people. Those statistics
are a far cry from the more positive picture painted in an AMA survey in
1956.[^1/6] Back then, only 22 percent thought doctors kept them waiting too
long, 19 percent thought doctors were not sufficiently frank with them in
discussing their treatment, and just 9 percent said doctors "think he's better
than other people."

More damning to the medical profession, however, is the growing
belief that doctors are too interested in making money---a rise to 69 percent
in 1993 from 60 percent in 1982. More than two-thirds of the people
surveyed the year before said they think doctors' fees are too high.
But worst of all, the share of those who think people are beginning to
lose faith in doctors---62 percent in 1982---hit an all-time high in 1993 at
70 percent.

Indeed, the image of the doctor in popular culture has changed dramatically
in the past two generations. Science writer Natalie Angier
noted the decline of doctors' images---"From Dr. Welby to Dr. Giggles, a
Steep Slide," is how the headline writer put it---in an article about the
treatment of doctors in movies and on television shows for the _New York
Times_ Sunday Arts and Leisure section. Dr. Welby was everyone's dream
of a good doctor; Dr. Giggles was the star villain in a slasher movie. It is
almost startling to see a rerun of Dr. Ben Casey on television simply because
he seems so in control. Angier noted that today's TV doctors have
more problems than their patients.[^1/7]

Many commentators note that all authority figures fell in popularity
during the anti-establishment decade of the 1960s and the antiheroic
decade of the 1970s. Lawyers, judges, businessmen, and, of course, politicians
and journalists, all saw their ratings sag. Blendon, considered the
top expert on health-care polls, found that the leaders of medicine still
ranked twice as high as leaders of other major institutions. But while the
others have enjoyed an upswing in confidence, the trust in medical
leaders has continued to decline.

There is much speculation about this. Hillary Clinton, in her pitch to
the AMA for health-care reform, pointed out that the tremendous stress
from the breakdown of the health-care system and "because ... we
haven't taken responsibility for fixing it"---has added to the clouds hanging
over doctors' heads. Others have pointed out that doctors' high income---on
average $177,400 and rising-makes them easy targets for
criticism by most wage earners, who on average make about a sixth as
much as doctors do.[^1/8] Some suggest that people put so much faith in
medicine's ability to cure---reminiscent of religious faith in the Dark
Ages---that a sharp disappointment results when it fails to fulfill the unrealistically
high expectations.[^1/9]

Blendon said the public generally has a lot of confidence in professions
or institutions that show altruistic behavior, scientific competence,
and a nonpolitical nature. If public confidence is based on those three
factors, it is not surprising that the image of the AMA has sunk so low.

### Looking After Doctors' Well-Being

Dr. Arnold S. Relman, the respected editor emeritus of the _New England
Journal of Medicine_, sought to explain the public's sense of betrayal by the
AMA in an interview published in the _AMA Journal_: "I think that the
AMA has the image of a trade organization. It represents what is best for
the economic and political interests of its members, and the American
public expects more than that from its doctors. Society subsidizes the education
of our physicians and then it grants them the licensed monopoly
to practice, assuring them authority and independence and power. This
power is granted on the condition that physicians put their patients
first---truly ahead of everything else."[^1/10]

The AMA is well aware of its image problem, in part because of its
polls and in part because of the prodding of people like Relman. Even its
own editor, _JAMA_'s George D. Lundberg, recognized the seriousness of
the AMA's ailing reputation in 1985. He wrote an editorial following the
release of an AMA poll showing the sharp decline of public trust of physicians
and organized medicine. He outlined a series of steps to rehabilitate
the image of medicine, including one point about appearances vs.
reality. "We should spend less time and money on influencing laws and
regulations and on formal public relations and should spend more time
and money on making things right," he declared. [^1/11]

Health-care reform offers the AMA that possibility, but so far the actions
of the AMA appear once again to be focused on issues that primarily
benefit doctors and the AMA: legal tort reform limiting a doctor's
liability if he or she is sued for malpractice, an attack on a global budget
and other fiscal devices that might limit doctors' pay, and relief from
antitrust laws to strengthen the doctors' bargaining position over economic
and other practice issues. To woo the AMA, Hillary Clinton offered
to help doctors rebuild their image.

But the AMA so far has not taken her up on her offer. Instead, at
their December 1993 meeting AMA delegates backed away from the
Clintons and their own four-year-old plan. The AMA doctors simply
could not stomach the idea of requiring employers to pay for the insurance
of their workers. Many of them, after all, have offices that employ
people. That means they, too, would have to pay for their employees'
health insurance.

The AMA's switch brought a harsh rebuke from Hillary Clinton. She
said, "Remember that the AMA institutionally opposed nearly every
health-care reform we've ever been able to achieve." She downplayed the
AMA's importance as a force in the health-care debate. Her husband
shared her chagrin. The President said he was "real disappointed" at the
