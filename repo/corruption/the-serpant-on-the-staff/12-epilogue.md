# EPILOGUE

As ,
THE 1990s began, the American
Medical Association moved into an elegant mirrored-glass building
in Chicago. The new headquarters is Japanese-designed and forwardlooking,
featuring sharp angles and a postmodern notch at the top. Left
behind in the move was the AMA's old home, kitty-corner from the new
one. It was a decades-old gray masonry structure, shaped like a squat
square block, looking more like a fortress than the home of the nation's
largest doctors' group. After the move, the AMA summarily razed the old
building and paved it over for a parking lot.

At the same time, the AMA began refashioning its image in an attempt
to bolster its sagging reputation. The AMA replaced the ornery
Texas general practitioner, who ran the association with an iron fist until
a financial scandal undid him, with his deputy, a smoother, Eastern
establishment-type. It spent $800,000 on a campaign to enhance the organization's
image, including doctoring the logo to make the snake-onthe-staff
look friendlier and more trustworthy. And it spent more than
$1 million more to buy ads in newspapers and magazines to boost the
image of doctors and to stress that a "new" AMA had emerged in time to
take part in the great national debate on health-care reform.

But try as it might, the AMA simply has not been able to bury its past,
or many of its problems, in the rubble of its old headquarters. In its move
to a new location, it has had little choice but to take with it a lot of old
baggage. And that baggage is the foundation on which stands the AMA,
its leaders, its policies, its politics, and its tactics.

Still, there is a new AMA. Throughout its history, the AMA has
reluctantly adapted to the change around it. When confronted by new
technology, potent social reforms, or inescapable economic shifts, the
AMA has taken the necessary steps to survive as an organization, to position
itself, to maintain influence, and to protect the interests of its members.
In doing so, the AMA also has abandoned positions or policies it no
longer needs.

Take the AMA's current stand on the use of tobacco. After the Surgeon
General issued his landmark condemnation of smoking in 1964
and on through the 1970s and into the mid-1980s, the AMA waffled.
However, the AMA's line now is clearly antitobacco, although the organization
itself is far from taking on the role as the ultimate antitobacco warrior.
From a political standpoint, the AMA no longer needs to make the
same trade-offs it once did with tobacco-state lawmakers who controlled
Congress when the AMA fought to defeat, and then shape, Medicare.
Now, on health-care legislation, the AMA must deal in the House with
two liberal Democrats from California and two moderate Democrats
from the Midwest, and in the Senate with two other moderate Democrats,
one from West Virginia and another from New York. From the perspective
of public relations, the AMA can gain points only by appearing
to be health-conscious, rather than politically expedient. And, in the debate
over sky-high health-care costs, the AMA can point to the expensive
care required by smokers and claim it is fighting that public-health
scourge. In contrast with the past, neutrality on tobacco issues no longer
pays political dividends for the AMA. It adapted.

And the AMA even came around on the issue of whether physicians
should be able to profit on the treatments they prescribe for their patients.
After defending the rights of doctors to "self-refer" patients to
clinical labs, MRI centers, and other physician-owned facilities, the AMA
decided the negative publicity was not worth the trouble. In an effort to
paint itself as an ethically responsible organization, the AMA imposed
stricter ethical guidelines, although it did not ban self-referrals altogether.
Besides, the AMA concluded that the main building boom of the
most popular high-tech facilities, such as MRIs, was over.

But while the AMA shucks such stands, it stays close to its core positions.
And that is where the "New" AMA vanishes and the "Old" AMA
reappears. All that the AMA does, it does to protect those core positions.
They are not all necessarily or inherently bad stands, but they are doctorcentered,
not patient-centered. Those core positions include

1) protecting
and extending the power of the AMA as an organization in and of
itself;
2) defending the autonomy or independent authority of doctors
over medical practice,
3) maintaining the AMA's and doctors' influence
over the entire health-care system,
4) ensuring doctors still can operate
under the fee-for-service system, and
5) enabling physicians to make as
much money as possible.

All of these positions are threatened by the
prospect of serious, structural reform of the U.S. health-care system.
That is why the AMA is a cheerleader for just enough reform to avoid a
major overhaul.

The AMA is fighting a three-front war on health-care reform. First,
it must battle with the Clinton administration and Congress to remove or
soften changes that adversely affect doctors. Second, it must joust with
other medical groups, including those nominally under its umbrella, that
have embraced positions the AMA opposes. And finally, to maintain its
membership and its status as a political powerhouse, the AMA must
counter the impression that it is a fading organization.

Board members and staff have confided that some of the saberrattling
on health-care reform is calculated more at rallying a membership
they perceive as highly conservative and frightened of even minor
changes than in reflecting the beliefs of those who govern the AMA. Its
leaders' public-relations efforts are designed to demonstrate to their special
audiences that the AMA is doing something. The political pragmatists
in the leadership are ready to make deals with the Administration
and Congress, knowing that the terms will be unpopular among many
members and that they will have to cajole these constituents.

AMA leaders are well aware that disgruntled members can vote with
their feet. The AMA reported in November 1993 that its membership
drive had for the year thus far fallen 3 percent short of the goal. The
AMA plays to a hard-to-please membership: physicians are accustomed
to having their way. Likewise, many members expect their leaders and
lobbyists to have the ability to march into Washington and get whatever
they want.

### THE "NEW" AMA's NEW LEADER

The "new" AMA's leader is a Harvard-trained surgeon turned medical
politician: Dr. James S. Todd. He already has brought a new attitude to
the AMA, dropping the confrontational blustering of the past for a more
conciliatory approach. Starting in the mid-1980s as the AMA's second-incommand,
he helped shape the organization's response to many outside
challenges. Now, in the 1990s, as the executive vice president, Todd has
already begun reconsidering some of those earlier responses.

Todd faces a formidable task. He must restore the AMA's reputation,
which the organization's own polls show to have reached a new low. He
must rebuild the membership, which has drained away so badly that the
percentage of doctors who are members has sunk to a level comparable
to what it was at the turn of the century. At the same time he must hold
together a profession split among factions of specialty and subspecialty
groups. And he must steer the AMA through potentially the biggest
change in the U.S. health-care system in more than a generation.

The sixty-two-year-old, white-haired Todd says he relishes his job,
and would not give it up for positions for which he has been approached
by executive headhunters, even one paying in the seven figures. He
gained his first recognition within the AMA's hierarchy during the 1970s
for his work on the malpractice-insurance crisis in New Jersey. But it was
in 1980 that he rose to prominence within the AMA as the chairman of
the committee that rewrote the Principles of Ethics. He served as board
member from 1980 until 1985, when the AMA hired him as deputy executive
vice president, the No. 2 staff position.

Todd made an unexpected early ascension to the top job at the AMA
when a scandal forced the AMA's longtime executive vice president, Dr.
James H. Sammons, to quit a year earlier than he had planned. Sammons
backed Todd as his successor, and it didn't take long for the AMA to offer
Todd a three-year contract, which in 1993 was renewed for another three
years. Todd makes $442,000 a year in his position as the head of the
$188-million not-for-profit membership association.

We had tried over several months to speak with Todd about issues
discussed in this book. But he expressed a reluctance to be interviewed.
Todd told us in a letter in fall 1993: "Under normal circumstances, I'd be
pleased to cooperate unconditionally but, from all indications, your book
about the AMA will hardly fit the definition of 'normal'" He reiterated
AMA concerns expressed a year earlier that our refusal to provide the
organization with a copy of our book outline indicated we "had made up
our minds about the AMA before completing the research and that, as a
result, your research would focus on 'proving'your convictions." He stipulated
he would consent to an interview only if he were permitted to review
for factual accuracy the section of the book pertaining to this
interview. We reluctantly agreed. More than a month passed before the
interview took place.

We finally sat down with Todd for a one-hour interview on November
3, 1993, in the conference room adjacent to his sixteenth-floor office
in the Chicago headquarters.

Todd assumed the job as the AMA's top doc at a time when the organization
and the health-care system were being buffeted by talk about
and perhaps the reality of reform. He has become a master of the rhetoric
of change. The AMA chief executive often has talked about the
AMA's House of Medicine being a House Divided and organized medicine
being on the verge of civil war between feuding specialties. He has a
plaque on a shelf in his office with a quote from Abraham Lincoln, who
dealt with a nation divided and at war with itself. Said Lincoln: "Let neither
a worship of the past, nor a confusion of the present, prevent us
from preparing wisely for the future."

Behind Todd's desk is another framed saying. This one is from The
Prince by the political theorist Machiavelli, known best for his philosophy
that all necessary means should be used to maintain authority. Here
there is a warning: "It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult
to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to
handle, than to initiate a new order of things."

Along these lines, one of the first things Todd did when he became
executive vice president was to proclaim the creation of a "new" AMA.
When asked what was wrong with the old one, Todd responded, "Nothing,
but times change, and an organization that fails to stay in step with
the times is doomed to failure." Todd looked back at his first year in his
job: "1990, ten years to a millennium, tremendous change in the governance
of this structure, tremendous change in needs of people for medical
care. It just was time to make a statement that said we were concerned
about all these things."

We wondered what about the AMA was new. After all, the same doctors
essentially were running the AMA before and after it declared itself
reborn. After a pause Todd replied, "I think it's more responsive. I think
the doctors of this country realize that change is inevitable, that they
want somebody or something that is going to help them accommodate to
this change, that can be a visible symbol of what physicians are trying to
do. You know that perception in this world is reality. You need to use the
terms and fit your action to what is going on at that particular time."

We asked about the future of the AMA after the system was reformed.
Some AMA staffers had suggested to us that the AMA might become
irrelevant under certain scenarios. As to the future, Todd said,
"The whole goal of the AMA at the moment, both at the board level and
at the staff level, is to make this organization flexible, agile, responsive
when necessary, out in front when appropriate." The AMA also is seeking
government permission to reestablish itself as the enforcer of discipline
of physicians, and at the same time to act as the doctors' bargaining
agent.

We pointed out how the AMA's own polls show that the image of doctors
and the AMA has slipped among most people. Todd acknowledged
this and noted that this "distrust" on the part of the public is affecting
other professions, including lawyers, clergymen, and businessmen. And
he said other AMA polls show the public trusts the AMA more than the
government. When asked about the size of the AMA's membership, he
said it is proportionally higher than most other voluntary associations.

The name American _Medical_ Association suggests a group that looks
after the interests of both doctors and patients. And the AMA likes to say
that that is what it does, though our conclusion is that the AMA is a
doctor-first organization. We asked why the group shouldn't be called the
American _Doctors_' Association. Todd answered: "Because it's more than
that. The doctors belong to it. Doctors supply a considerable amount of
their resources to help us do what it is we do. But we do a lot of things that
are not directly for the benefit of doctors. I mean, the campaign against
cholesterol. The campaign against violence. Adolescent health. And you
could name, I suspect, women's health, our consumer publishing activity.
We're more than a doctor organization."

When it comes down to the interests of doctors vs. the interests of
patients, we asked which way the AMA would go. Todd finessed an answer.
"Hopefully the right way," he said. We asked for an example. "A
good example is the resource-based relative value schedule (sic). The
resource-relative value schedule was not fundamentally to the doctors'
economic interest," he said. We asked why this was contrary to physician
interests. After all, the chairman of the AMA Board had referred to this
system as a means of preserving fee-for-service. Todd said: "Because fees
were going to be limited, there was going to be a foundation upon which
to judge the appropriateness of physicians' fees. But the basic issue was
that neither the physician nor the public had any method by which to determine
the appropriateness of fees or physicians to justify them."

We asked how this scale benefits patients. "Cost containment. Plain
and simple," said Todd. But at the time the AMA made the decision to
work for a fee schedule, the other options were fixed fees, known as capitation,
or diagnostic-related groups (DRGs), both of which would have
reduced payments to physicians even more. All the fee schedule does is
preserve fee-for-service. Then we asked how does fee-for-service, a frequently
chanted AMA mantra, benefit patients. "Sixty percent of the
people in this country get their care under fee-for-service. It is the preferred
mode of care delivery amongst all of the polls we do."

When asked why fee-for-service medicine is so important to the
AMA, Todd said, "Before the government and the insurance companies
got involved, it used to be a one-on-one relationship of mutual trust and
responsibility. And that's fundamental in the healing process. Are you
going to enjoy seeing a different doctor every time you go to your facility?
Don't you want to develop a sense of trust, a relationship, a personal relationship?"

In other systems, such as health-maintenance organizations, we
pointed out that patients don't necessarily lose that continuity. "You
might, but you don't have to," Todd agreed. "But, you know, one size
doesn't fit all. And yes, you can level some criticisms at the fee-for-service
system; you can level some criticisms at the managed care-HMO systems.
And I think that what we're trying to say is patients ought to have the information
upon which they can make their personal judgment as to
where they want to be."

We asked whether the AMA will outlive health-system reform. Todd
said that the AMA's missions relating to science and medical education
will help the organization survive no matter what. He expressed irritation
about media views of the AMA that emphasize its political and socioeconomic
activities over its other missions. He said that for every
dollar the AMA spends on "socioeconomics," it spends two dollars on
other things, including science and education. And he downplays the
pacesetting millions the AMA's PAC spends on politics, calling the money
it contributes to each politician's campaign fund as a "drop in the bucket."

Some observers say the AMA may be less relevant after reform. But
Todd said, "I can make an argument it will be more relevant because the
AMA is the only organization that is able to accommodate all of the diverse
interests within the profession. We may not agree with them. They
may be divisive, but we understand them and can explain them. And if
you have increasing centralization of health care at the government
level, the government is not going to want to deal with eighty-nine specialty
societies. They are physically incapable of doing it. And therefore
they are going to look to some sort of structure or organization than can
embrace all of the diversity of medicine." He described the AMA as the
"final common pathway" of all the conflicting agendas within medicine.

The interview occurred just days after President Clinton finally unveiled
his 1,342-page Health Security Act. The Clinton bill not only
would require at least one fee-for-service plan in each region, but would
allow a physician organization like the AMA to negotiate on behalf of
doctors. Todd said the Administration had made some changes the AMA
had sought. Still, much remained unclear about what would transpire in
the months ahead. Todd said this much: "I think this is going to be one
of the greatest domestic debates this country has ever seen. It will far
surpass Social Security, and I don't think we've seen anything close to
what will eventually pass. I get the impression that something will happen
next summer, next fall. The Congress can't go home without having
done something on health-system reform."

## THE AMA's FUTURE

There is a saying within organized medicine that if there were no AMA,
one would have to be invented. And for nearly 150 years, the AMA has
struggled to hold together the often-warring factions within medicine.
The outcome of the reform efforts will be important for us all, but for the
AMA as a _political_ organization it could be a matter of life or death. Even
though the AMA has helped maximize doctors' earnings from Medicare,
its membership dropped after its loss on this issue in the mid-1960s. If it
cannot deliver for its constituents on the current health reform, its membership
could further erode or even evaporate.

Hillary Rodham Clinton, the President's chief navigator for health
reform, has predicted that under reform a "Darwinian struggle" will take
place among health insurers. Reform also will bring to bear evolutionary
forces on the AMA. And as it did after it lost its monumental battle over
Medicare, the AMA is likely to sharpen its focus.

After Medicare, the AMA leadership faced two paths. One was to devote
the organization to science and educational issues, doctoring in the
purer Asklepian form, symbolized by the single serpent on the staff. The
other was the political path, seeking the power to look after doctors' financial
interests. Mercury, the patron god of businessmen, symbolized
by the twin serpents of the caduceus, would favor this approach.

The AMA chose the second path, that of politics, transforming the
organization into a big-time wheeler and dealer. The AMA says only onethird
of its budget goes to politics. But as one of the country's largest
PACs and a self-proclaimed 800-pound gorilla on Capitol Hill, it has no
problem opening doors in Washington. AMA leaders even classify their
meetings about physician pocketbook issues with politicians as being
"educational." And over the years, the AMA has increasingly concentrated
on defending and cushioning doctors against change.

Whatever happens with health reform, the AMA will survive in some
form. It is well financed, has a strong survival instinct, and often has had
its way. Hence, we advise the public: listen to what the AMA has to say, but
consider that its message may not be as altruistic as it would have you believe.
Remember it is a doctor-first organization, a special interest that
may not put patient interests first. Recognize that though it uses the symbol
of Asklepios, a minor god in the Greek Pantheon, that the AMA is as
fallible as other human institutions, that it may blunder policies on
health issues because of its own ignorance, bias, poor judgment, and political
agenda. Beware the Serpent on the Staff.
