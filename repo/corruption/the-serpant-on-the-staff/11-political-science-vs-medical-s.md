# Political Science vs. Medical Science: Bungling Health Policy on the AIDS Epidemic[^9/0]

Larry kramer watched powerlessly
as friends died from a strange new infection afflicting young gay
men. A physician who cared for many of these men prodded the New
York playwright to sound the alarm in the gay community about the dangers
of unprotected, promiscuous sex. In his 1985 play _The Normal Heart_,
Kramer recounts the incident: Emma, the physician, chides Ned Weeks,
a stand-in for the author, for his less-than-successful efforts to get the
word out. Weeks angrily asks the physician what her medical brethren
were doing to fight the growing epidemic: "What the fuck is your side
doing? Where's the goddamned AMA in all of this?"[^9/1]

It was a good question. Instead of being in the forefront of fighting
the disease, the AMA sat on the sidelines, with much of the rest of
organized medicine and the government, and failed to respond quickly
to this modern plague. As gay men and then intravenous drug users
were infected and died, the medical establishment, which should have
shown compassion and attacked the problem the best it could, looked the
other way. AIDS did not become a public concern until years later, when
the "innocent victims" were recognized: heterosexuals infected by the
tainted blood supply, hemophiliacs, and babies born to infected women.

It was not until 1987, six years into the epidemic, that the AMA
adopted its first comprehensive package of policies designed to help the
profession and the public deal with the outbreak. AIDS proved to be difficult
for the American Medical Association to tackle in part because it
involved sexual transmission of disease---and homosexual sex at that.
Doctors and doctor organizations appear to be just as squeamish about
sex as the rest of society, a situation that fosters ignorance and the spread
of disease. In the aftermath of this public health-policy fiasco, by October
1993, 339,250 Americans had been diagnosed with AIDS and
204,390 had died. Another one million had been infected with Human
Immunodeficiency Virus, the so-called AIDS virus.[^9/2]

## A VICTORIAN MIND-SET ON SEX

The AMA has a history of mishandling sexual issues. In the Victorian
Age, Dr. Denslow Lewis broke new ground when he studied sexual response
in men and women. The Chicago sexologist presented his landmark
findings at the annual scientific conference of the American
Medical Association in 1899, scandalizing many attendees.

Scientific reports presented at the meeting ordinarily were included
in the Proceedings of the AMA carried in the _Journal of the American Medical
Association_. But after some outraged doctors declared the research
obscene, the study was suppressed. However, in the 1970s, a Nashville
psychiatrist discovered the injustice done to Lewis and championed
his cause. Finally, eighty-four years after Lewis originally submitted his
manuscript and seventy years after his death, the sexologist received
his due. Dr. George D. Lundberg, _JAMA_'s editor, published Lewis's findings
in July 1983 under the heading "Delayed Communications." In an
editorial in the _Journal_, Dr. William Masters, the famed sexologist, said
that if Lewis's research had been published earlier, much suffering over
sexual matters could have been avoided.[^9/3]

In more recent times, the AMA blushed about sexually transmitted
diseases. The organization launched a public service campaign on television
to attack the rising incidence of venereal disease in the sexually
switched-on sixties. But when the networks leaned on the physician
group, AMA officials eliminated from a sixty-second animated announcement
specific mention of syphilis, gonorrhea, and the expression
"intimate contact."[^9/4] Victorian sensitivities prevailed once again.

## OUT OF THE CLOSET, ONTO THE EXAMINING TABLE

If the AMA had trouble dealing with heterosexual sex, homosexual sex
was even more difficult. During the early years of the "gay liberation"
movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, homosexuals protested
being stigmatized not only in society at large but in medical offices. Psychiatry,
which labels what is "normal," had for a century officially defined
homosexuality as a type of mental illness. If a physician took a sexual history,
a rare occurrence in itself, he or she would consider a homosexual
abnormal by definition. And, if the doctor did encounter a gay patient,
he or she probably would not be aware of the special health problems
connected with homosexuality, such as gastrointestinal diseases and sexually
transmitted infections linked to anal sex.

The AMA began to consider addressing the issue of gays in the early
1970s. It was a reflection of a time when legislators in some states had
removed from the books antisodomy statutes that had prohibited sexual
relations between consenting adults of the same sex. AMA delegates
considered a resolution in December 1974 calling for decriminalization
of homosexual relations between consenting adults. But conservative elements
shot down this policy because they feared AMA support "might
be misinterpreted as an endorsement of prostitution."[^9/5] The House of
Delegates the following June found a way around this, declaring they
supported "in principle repeal of laws which classify as criminal any form
of noncommercial sexual conduct between consenting adults. ..."[^9/6]

Six years later, in December 1981, AMA delegates passed their first
policy concerning homosexuals' health-care needs. The AMA said "nonjudgmental
recognition of sexual orientation enhances the ability to render
optimal patient care," especially in care of homosexuals. Gays
praised the organization for saying that physicians should be educated to
be"attuned" to the special medical and psychological needs of homosexuals.
But activists were incensed when the AMA said it would encourage
development of programs to make gays aware of "the possibility of sex
preference reversal in selected cases" using aversion therapy, such as
with electrical shocks.[^9/7]

The 1981 AMA report on homosexuality made brief mention of
some unusual diseases, referred to as "opportunistic infections," that
seemed to be related to immune-system problems in gay men. AMA delegates
did not know it, but they were witnessing a volcano about to erupt.

## AIDS: THE EARLY YEARS

On June 5, 1981, in its publication _Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report_,
the federal Centers for Disease Control, the government's top disease
watchers and fighters, reported on the appearance of opportunistic infections
in five young Los Angeles men. They had been diagnosed with
_Pneumocystis carin√º_ pneumonia and other viral and fungal infections ordinarily
found in people such as those with cancer or who had undergone
organ transplants, people whose immune systems had been
severely suppressed. Two of the gays had died, according to the report.

The collection of symptoms initially was referred to as GRIDS: gayrelated
immune deficiency syndrome. The name for the disease was
changed to AIDS---acquired immune deficiency syndrome---when doctors
found the condition also occurred in heterosexual intravenous drug
users who shared needles. Blood and semen were the carriers of the
virus that caused the disease.

The AMA staff considered the new disease a mere curiosity. It did
not expect the outbreak to become a worldwide pandemic. Dr. Norbert
Rapoza, a virologist who joined the AMA Department of Drugs in spring
1982, told _American Medical News_ that the AMA had been "slow on the
uptake---we thought (AIDS) would be confined to maybe 5,000 cases
and would disappear."[^9/8]

Dealing with an emerging epidemic, the AMA, which claims to be
concerned about the public's health, was indecisive. Dr. Leonard Fenninger,
AMA vice president for science policy at that time, said the organization
was divided internally over what to do. Physicians from areas
more heavily affected by AIDS, such as California, wanted the AMA to
make AIDS policy a top priority, while other factions downplayed its significance.
The best the AMA could muster in its first policy statement,
adopted in December 1983, was to support publication of information
about AIDS for the profession and public, call for physicians to become
aware of AIDS symptoms, endorse "nonjudgmental" care for patients,
and to request doctors uninformed about AIDS or who "do not choose to
provide ... care" to know to whom to refer patients.[^9/9]

Monumental effort was required to get the House of Delegates to
adopt this innocuous statement, which had been strongly opposed by
many rank-and-file delegates. The Council on Scientific Affairs, the
House's scientific branch, and the staff had to twist arms to get even that
passed. [^9/10]

Fenninger, who before joining the AMA was assistant head of the
National Institutes of Health, said the very nature of AIDS made it a
tricky subject even for doctors. The problem was the disease was intimately
linked to anal sex in homosexuals and to drug abuse in underclass
African-American and Latino communities. It was not a subject about
which the typical AMA delegate cared to know. By the time the AMA
adopted its AIDS policy in 1983, the tally kept by the CDC had reached
2,841 people diagnosed with AIDS, 1,158 of whom had died. [^9/11]

## THE AMA FINALLY TAKES A STAND

Some people argue that no significant public health efforts could have
been undertaken to attack AIDS until the test for HIV antibodies was approved
in March 1985. The test made it possible to screen the blood supply
through which some patients had been infected. Also, for the first
time, the test made it feasible for sexual partners of AIDS patients to find
out if they had been infected---though no treatment was available. Still,
the AMA did not act until two years after the test was approved.

In June 1987, six years into the AIDS epidemic, the House of Delegates
for the first time was considering a comprehensive package of
AIDS policies. At this time the CDC's AIDS count had reached 53,812
diagnosed cases, with 31,862 deaths. [^9/12]

Dr. David Ostrow, an AIDS researcher at the University of Michigan
and a member of an AMA advisory panel on AIDS formed in 1985, said
the intent of the AMA policies was good. But he complained that it had
been slapped together quickly by AMA staff a week earlier without consulting
with the advisory panel or other AIDS experts. "This is going to
be the first time that the AMA has said what it thinks about AIDS, and the
report was done without the input of the experts," he said.[^9/13]

With an unusually large contingent of press in attendance, America
seemed to be awaiting word of the AMA view on AIDS. The AMA unveiled
a complex package of forty recommendations to attack the disease.
It supported education programs to prevent the spread of AIDS,
extension of anti-discrimination laws to cover people infected with HIV,
review of research on how to prevent HIV among intravenous drug
users, and development of methods for public-health officials to warn
sexual partners of HIV-infected people.

The cornerstone of the policy package was testing for antibodies to
HIV. AMA delegates endorsed routine antibody testing in clinics for people
with sexually transmitted diseases, those seeking family planning services,
and pregnant women in the first trimester. The AMA supported
mandatory testing of prison inmates, immigrants, and military recruits.
The AMA contended voluntary testing should be encouraged for homosexuals,
bisexuals, and intravenous drug users, and their sexual partners.

Significantly, the delegates came out for routine, voluntary testing of
patients requiring invasive procedures or surgery if they lived in areas
with a high incidence of AIDS or who were homosexuals or drug abusers.
If voluntary patient testing were refused, delegates urged that hospitals
and doctors consider mandatory testing. In other words, patients
were seen as a potential source of HIV for doctors. It had not been
stressed yet what the experts already suspected: HIV spread could be a
two-way street.

Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, a conservative praised for his approach
to caring for AIDS patients, endorsed the AMA's policies: "Imperfect
as they may seem to some, \[they\] would be a good start on a
national policy."[^9/14] But some experts warned that AMA policy could be
used to justify abuses such as removal of doctors from their jobs, as had
happened in a recent incident at Chicago's Cook County Hospital. "They
\[AMA delegates\] recommend routine testing of all health-care workers
and don't give reasons for that," researcher Ostrow said. "They don't say
anything about the right of an infected doctor to work."[^9/15] The AMA, in
fact, was laying the groundwork for an AIDS policy disaster.

## DEFENDING A DOCTOR'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE A PATIENT

A few months earlier, Dr. W. Dudley Johnson, a Milwaukee surgeon who
pioneered heart-bypass techniques, shocked many when he revealed
that he and his partners had refused to treat two patients infected with
AIDS. Since the spring of 1986, Johnson and his partners had begun
screening the blood of all prospective patients for HIV antibodies. He
told the _Milwaukee Journal_ that he did not know of any surgeons who had
contracted HIV from infected patients: "I want to keep it that way." After
that, several other health-care workers admitted they had refused to care
for AIDS patients. [^9/16]

Some doctors feared that their lives and their livelihoods---with potential
lifetime earnings in the multimillions---could be jeopardized by
an accidental stick with a needle smeared with HIV-infected blood or a
bloody bone fragment slicing through their gloves during surgery. Furthermore,
studies showed that many doctors preferred not to treat HIVinfected
patients and homosexuals in general.

Mindful of the negative image of doctors refusing care to sick patients,
the AMA Board of Trustees in November 1987 declared doctors
had an ethical obligation to care for patients with HIV/AIDS. Dr. Russel
H. Patterson, vice chairman of the AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial
Affairs, said: "For centuries, the medical professional has taken care
of patients with contagious diseases-smallpox, bubonic plague, whooping
cough, to name a few. Society has accorded physicians a special place
in life, and, in return, has come to expect that even at some risk to themselves,
physicians will take care of patients. The Judicial Council believes
nothing has changed. Doctors should be expected to take a degree of risk
in caring for patients with AIDS."[^9/17]

Buttressing its case, the AMA Board proudly pointed to the organization's
original Code of Ethics from 1847, which stated: "When pestilence
prevails, it is their \[physicians'\] duty to face the danger and to
continue their labors for the alleviation of the suffering, even at the
jeopardy of their own lives." The policy was unprecedented in medical
annals. In fact, in earlier times, many physicians, including revered figures
such as Galen, the second-century medical scholar and physician to
Roman emperors, ran away from plagues. Because doctors fled from
towns devastated by the Black Death, some European governments enacted
laws in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to forbid such behavior.

### The AMA Offers an Escape Route

The AMA's citation of the 1847 statement on physicians facing down
pestilence sounded noble, but it was misleading. When the organization
streamlined its Principles of Ethics in 1957, mention of the duty to care
for patients during contagious outbreak was dropped.[^9/18] No one had
foreseen a plague like AIDS.

Furthermore, despite its apparent high-minded stand, the AMA
gave doctors a different message out of the other side of its mouth: physicians
could excuse themselves from caring for patients whom they considered
themselves "not competent" to treat. Dr. Alan R. Nelson, AMA
Board chairman, put the most positive spin on this by saying a referral
may be in the patient's best interest "when caring for that patient is not
within the current realm of the physician's competence."[^9/19] This view was
consistent with Principle VI of AMA's Principles of Ethics, which has
held since 1912 that except in emergencies, physicians should be "free to
choose whom to serve, with whom to associate and the environment in
which to provide medical services."[^9/20]

If a doctor felt that continuing caring for an AIDS patient was
beyond his skills and knowledge, he only was bound ethically to try to
find the patient a new physician or to give the patient reasonable notice
that he was being dropped. Society holds soldiers, policemen, and firemen
to a higher standard than the AMA held physicians in this medical
crisis.

Dr. David Rogers, vice chairman of the National Commission on
AIDS, said doctors refer patients routinely to consultants with special
expertise. For example, neurosurgeons are not qualified to perform
hysterectomies. But Rogers contended that the AMA position provided
doctors with an "ethical" excuse to keep AIDS/HIV patients out of their
offices. He said patients with HIV sometimes need specialized care, but
"80 percent-plus of their treatment ought to be in the hands of ordinary
working-stiff doctors." Jeffrey Levi, government relations director of the
AIDS Action Council, agreed. "I don't know of any other disease for
which there is that kind of bail-out option."[^9/21]

The AMA's position on physicians' obligation to patients with HIV/
AIDS posed a deeper dilemma, one that goes to the very root of the
AMA philosophy toward patient care. Ethicists said that the AMA policy
flowed from the "contract model of medical care." With this approach,
care for patients in effect is a commodity, and physicians are not required
to practice medicine in a _moral_ fashion. Under AMA ethics, with the exception
of emergencies, doctors could pick and choose which patients
they were willing to treat. In the AMA's own _Journal_, medical ethicists
Dr. Abigail Zuger and Steven H. Miles urged the profession to change its
approach. They called for a "virtue-based medical ethic," under which
patients with AIDS or other dread diseases would be cared for because it
was the right thing to do.[^9/22]

But the AMA is not about to budge on its philosophy. It may condemn
the sin of refusing compassionate care to patients with HIV infections
or full-blown AIDS, but the sinner is, as the AMA puts it, "free to
choose whom to serve."

## DOCTORS WITH AIDS

One of the AMA's brightest moments during the AIDS crisis was when it
successfully went to bat in court for Gene Arline, a Florida teacher who
was fired because she had experienced three relapses of tuberculosis.
Citing AMA arguments, the Supreme Court for the first time created a
standard for defining whether people with infectious disease were handicapped
and therefore qualified for protection against discrimination
under the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Only if an individual's disease
posed a "_significant risk_" to others was an employer justified in removing
him or her from the job. Lower courts extended the finding to
the HIV-infected.[^9/23]

But the AMA seemed to ignore its own landmark case in the winter
of 1991 when the CDC nailed down the first spread of HIV from a
health worker, a Florida dentist, to his patients. Anticipating a public
backlash against all doctors, the AMA reversed its position and called for
the infected doctors and health workers to stop performing "invasive" or
surgical procedures on their patients.

It all started in late July 1990, when the CDC issued a report on a
dentist with AIDS who may have infected a young woman, designated as
Patient A. Based on another, far more infectious blood-borne virus, hepatitis
B, experts had long recognized the possibility of health workers infecting
their patients.

Nobody was prepared for the fallout from the first HIV infection
spread from doctor to patient. The public was panicky. Doctors tried to
be reassuring, but they were not persuasive. Medicine was in deep denial.
The CDC convened experts in August 1990 to review the dangers
infected health workers posed to their patients and what could be done
to prevent HIV transmission. During the discussions, underlying differences
of opinion became clear as representatives of various groups
staked out positions on whether infected health workers should be restricted
and how to define which procedures posed possible dangers to
patients. Foreshadowing events to come, virologist Norbert Rapoza, the
AMA representative, asked: "What does the HIV-infected health-care
worker who gets cut during an invasive procedure tell the patient into
whose open wound he has bled: 'I'm sorry but I've just killed you'?"[^9/24]
The position was consistent with 1987 AMA policy, which said an infected
physician should not place his or her patients at risk. Until the implications
of the dental case started to sink in, no one had paid much
attention to the AMA policy.

Other health experts attending this session thought they could head
off the AMA's propensity to restrict infected health workers. They
pointed out that patients faced far greater risks from hospital-spread infections
or from the unsteady hand of a surgeon who had been abusing
alcohol or drugs or who was upset from an argument with a spouse earlier
in the day. With little media coverage, the debate initially remained
confined to the small circle of medical-association officials and CDC consultants.

However, the incident assumed a new urgency when Patient A went
public with her story. She was Kimberly Bergalis, of Fort Pierce, Florida,
a clean-cut twenty-two-year-old who had no known risk factors for HIV.
She said she had never had sexual intercourse. Her only apparent means
of catching the disease was from having been treated by Dr. David Acer,
though investigators did not know and may never know precisely how
the virus passed from dentist to patient. By chance, a state health investigator
figured out the dental spread of HIV because Bergalis mentioned
that Acer had extracted her molars, and he happened to know
that the dentist had AIDS.

Acer, forty, died September 3, 1990; four days later, several Florida
newspapers published a letter Acer had written to inform his patients
about his illness and his contention that he had followed CDC guidelines,
including wearing a mask and gloves. Some experts think Acer may have
been less than scrupulous about following those guidelines or that he deliberately
infected-murdered---his patients. More than 500 former patients
soon came forward to be tested. On September 21 it was revealed
that two more patients had been diagnosed with HIV. (Ultimately, six
HIV infections would be linked to Acer.)

Meanwhile, Bergalis and her parents mounted a campaign calling
for mandatory testing for HIV of all doctors to prevent a recurrence of
what happened to Kimberly. They also urged that patients be tested to
protect health workers. Bergalis was the first HIV patient to go public
and complain bitterly about how the medical profession had responded
to the AIDS epidemic.

While there were some calls for widespread testing and restriction of
infected physicians, Dr. M. Roy Schwarz, AMA vice president for medical
education and science, said such actions were premature: "Until science
proves it unequivocally, we think ... that it would not be wise to change
the guidelines \[for testing\]---unless the CDC has evidence we don't know
about."[^9/25] This seemed to contrast with the sort of get-tough approach
advocated earlier by AMA virologist Rapoza.

### Internal Tension About Policy

The AMA was experiencing internal tension over the issue, and would
soon take a course different from that suggested in the Acer case.
Schwarz said the Acer case brought AIDS into focus for the AMA by raising
questions about what should be done, on the one hand, with a doctor
who was HIV-positive, and, on the other, to protect the public health. He
said in an interview that some within the AMA felt strongly that this was
an ethical matter: "Since we above all else try to 'Do no harm,' that in this
case we'd err on the side of caution. If you were HIV-positive you should
not do any invasive procedure, and if you did it, you ought to disclose to
the patient and let the patient make their choice."

He said he was among those who believed there was no scientific evidence
for limiting HIV-infected physicians. He compared this restrictive
approach to "saying go ahead and burn the people at the stake because
you think they're witches even though you haven't got any evidence for it.
I was convinced that the risk \[of doctor-to-patient transmission\] was extraordinarily
small ... probably so small you could never measure it.
And therefore you shouldn't jump to a blanket public policy requiring a
whole bunch of things on what is primarily a theoretical risk."[^9/26] This
view would prevail, but only after a year and a half on a policy roller
coaster.

## PUBLIC RELATIONS VS. PUBLIC HEALTH

Shortly, events turned up the pressure, and AMA leadership felt compelled
to adopt a strong public position. The CDC had found through
genetic testing of viruses that three patients had been infected by virtually
the same virus found in Acer, the _Los Angeles Times_ reported on
January 11, 1991.[^9/27]

There was no public health threat, but the anticipated public fear
was palpable. The AMA wanted to stifle potential panic. Responding to
the article, the AMA Board, which had been slow on the draw in the past,
sometimes taking years to hammer out policy, was stampeded in a twohour
discussion to adopt a policy on HIV-infected health workers. The
board chose to take what it described as an ethical stand. But in trying to
reassure the public, it jeopardized the welfare of HIV-infected physicians.

In a statement on January 17, 1991, the day before the CDC officially
published the latest findings in its _Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report_, the AMA Board of Trustees said that because of "uncertainty
about risks to patient health, the medical profession, as a matter of medical
ethics, should err on the side of protecting patients. ... Until the uncertainty
about transmission is resolved, the AMA believes that HIVinfected
physicians should not perform invasive procedures that pose an
identifiable risk to transmission or should disclose their seropositive status
prior to performing the procedure and proceed only if there is informed
consent." Physicians at risk who perform invasive procedures
should be tested periodically for HIV on a voluntary basis, the AMA said.

A high-level CDC official said, "I can only assume that when they
heard what the report was going to say, they sort of said, 'Oh, oh, maybe
it's right and what side of this do we want to be on?"" He contended that
the board adopted the policy "for PR purposes. They feared the press
would come out and say, 'Here are all these rich doctors protecting themselves.
All they care about is themselves and their incomes. They don't
care about patients. They weren't going to be viewed as protecting the
self-interest of doctors. They really went way beyond even what CDC was
thinking of at that point." In fact, the AMA had set the tone for a monumental
policy debate.

The board was retreating from the legal principle the AMA had established
of a significant risk of disease spread being grounds for removal
from a job. It now advocated a new standard, saying that any HIV-infected
health worker who posed an identifiable risk to his or her patients
should be removed. If anyone could come up with a scenario under
which there was the remotest chance of HIV transmission from a doctor
to patient, then the health worker would be prohibited from performing
the procedure. To steady the public's nerves, the AMA was proposing an
unattainable zero-risk standard. Schwarz explained at the time: "The
board thinks we have to help the public to manage their fears."[^9/28]

### The AMA Is Assailed

The AMA had dug itself into a hole from which it would be hard to extract
itself. It and the American Dental Association, which had taken a
similar stand, immediately came under attack. Critics saw the AMA position
as an unscientific, public-relations gimmick that was unworkable
because physicians who disclosed their status would be committing professional
suicide. No patient would want to go under the knife of an HIVinfected
surgeon, though there was no evidence the patient was at a
real risk.

The Centers for Disease Control conducted a conference in February
1991 at which representatives from medical, public health, and labor
groups thrashed out what should be done. The AMA and ADA stood
alone in support of voluntary testing.

"Even if the policy is not universally effective, it is better than any of
the alternatives," Dr. Nancy W. Dickey, an AMA Board member, told the
hostile audience. "And patients are certainly better off knowing that the
profession has publicly reaffirmed that their interests will always come
first."[^9/29]

In contrast, public-health groups, strongly influenced by advocates
for people infected with HIV, took a "civil rights" approach and opposed
even voluntary testing for fear it would lead to mandatory testing. They
were concerned that such restrictive policies could result in infected doctors
and other health workers losing their jobs and facing discrimination
for no good reason.

The AMA was singled out for criticism at the session. However, the
AMA attempted to create an image of AMA solidarity with the rest of
medicine. _American Medical News_, the official AMA newspaper, reported
that the AMA joined with other groups in opposing mandatory testing.
But the truth was the AMA and the ADA stood alone, as the _Journal of the
American Medical Association_ pointed out. [^9/30] While the AMA and ADA
wanted the Acer affair to serve as the basis for policy, other medical
groups portrayed the case as a rarity, and hence a poor model for national
policy.

The AMA claimed to be putting patients first, but there was another
interpretation. By abandoning HIV-infected doctors, most of whom
were gay, the AMA could quiet public fears and keep the heat off the rest
of the profession.

## SLAY THE AMA

The House of Delegates reviewed the board's actions during a particularly
tumultuous time. ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power),
an activist group famous for street theater, attacked the AMA's policies
on AIDS, national health insurance, and alternative healing at the AMA's
annual meeting in Chicago in June 1991. ACT UP staged what it called a
"Slay the AMA" protest. Protesters marched on the AMA's meeting headquarters,
carrying signs calling on the AMA to oppose mandatory HIV
testing of physicians, and posters with pictures of board members with
the word GUILTY stamped across their foreheads. As the more than 200
protesters marched, some spray-painted "Fight the AMA" slogans onto
the street and buildings and shouted murderer" at AMA delegates. One
ACT UP member infiltrated the House of Delegates during a speech by
Vice President Dan Quayle, shouting that "People with AIDS need national
health care." The Secret Service whisked her away. Quayle told a
press conference that he supported mandatory testing of doctors and
patients.

Outside the hotel, more than two dozen protesters were arrested for
mob action. ACT UP made it clear that it viewed the AMA as an obstacle
to ensuring that people with AIDS as well as other Americans obtain
medical care.[^9/31]

### "Tell or Quit": Getting Tough with HIV-Infected Health Workers

During the annual session, the House reaffirmed the policies on testing
of physicians who performed invasive procedures the board had advocated
the previous January. Board member Dr. Raymond Scalettar summarized
the policy: infected physicians should "tell or quit."[^9/32]

Public hysteria about iatrogenicor doctor-caused AIDS was growing.
Dentists were buying advertisements announcing they had been tested
to be free of HIV, a move that critics felt would create a false sense of
security among patients. In some cases, infected physicians went public
or were exposed in the press, with the result that they were fired or had to
shut down their practices.

The CDC in July 1991 issued guidelines to encourage health workers
who performed exposure-prone procedures to undergo testing for
HIV, and those found infected were urged to stop performing such procedures
unless they were counseled by an expert review panel on how to
continue. The agency did not define which procedures posed a special
risk, leaving that decision to medical, surgical, and dental societies and
local hospitals. Board member Dickey said that the CDC guidelines were
"close to AMA policy. ... Speaking for the medical profession, we accept
the charge to further identify exposure-prone procedures."[^9/33]

Science may not have backed AMA and CDC policies, but the policies
resonated with public opinion. Polls conducted in the summer of
1991 showed that the vast majority of patients wanted to know if their
doctors were infected, and most said they would seek care elsewhere if
their caregivers were infected with HIV. Likewise, the public felt that patients
should inform their doctors if they were HIV-infected. Soon, the
politicians, currying public favor, weighed in.

Congressman William E. Dannemeyer, the rock-ribbed conservative
Republican from Southern California, introduced a bill in Kimberly
Bergalis's name designed to establish mandatory testing of physicians
who performed invasive procedures and patients scheduled to undergo
them. The proposal also required physicians to be tested for HIV in connection
with obtaining malpractice insurance and hospital privileges.
Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican from North Carolina,
introduced an amendment to the House-passed Treasury Appropriations
Bill. Helms's punitive legislation would have hit health workers with
ten years in prison and/or $10,000 in fines for not disclosing to patients
that they were HIV-infected.

The AMA favored controls and testing, but not the heavy hammer of
criminal law. In a letter delivered to Helms the day before the vote,
Dr. James Todd, AMA'schief executive, said, "The American Medical Association
believes that only through application of sound medical principles,
rather than through the arm of the criminal justice system, will we
be able to confront the issues of HIV-infected health workers with compassion,
dignity and rationality and thus ensure the safety and health of
all our patients."

Helms's bill passed in summer 1991 by an 81--18 margin. As a backstop,
by a 99--0 margin, the Senate also passed another amendment to
the Treasury Appropriations Bill, developed by the Senate leadership,
mandating that states receiving funding for health programs adopt CDC
guidelines or their "equivalent" on health-care workers being tested and
disclosing their status to patients. Weeks later, on a voice vote, the Senate
passed another Helms amendment attached to the Commerce Appropriations
Bill that required passage of state laws that would allow doctors
performing invasive procedures to test patients for HIV without first obtaining
specific consent, except in emergencies.[^9/34]

## SEEKING A CONSENSUS

When the AMA was called on to lead the way on developing policy on
infected doctors, it gladly took on the role. But because it promoted a policy
based on public relations rather than science, it seriously bungled the
job, alienating other medical and advocacy groups and unnecessarily
keeping the public on edge.

The CDC announced in August 1991 that with the help of medical
organizations it intended to "quickly" develop a list of exposure-prone
procedures, those in which a health workers' blood might come into contact
with a patient's body cavities, mucous membranes, or tissue beneath
the skin. The CDC, like the AMA, discouraged infected physicians from
performing exposure-prone procedures.

In this guideline the CDC said it wanted the private sector, the national
medical societies, to reach a consensus on which procedures were
risky for HIV-infected doctors to perform. CDC planned to incorporate
that information into its guidelines. CDC has no regulatory power, but its
recommendations often are adopted as state or federal laws. However,
bills before both Houses showed that some in Congress favored forcing
the states to accept CDC guidelines for HIV-infected doctors.

Responding to the CDC, the AMA, nominal leader of American
medicine, sponsored a conference, hoping to involve dozens of medical
specialty groups in the development of a list of exposure-prone procedures.
Going into the meeting, only a handful of groups, including the
American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had declared their support for
keeping HIV-infected members of their specialties out of the operating
room, especially when exposure-prone procedures were being performed.
They, along with the American Dental Association, had promised
to develop lists of invasive procedures that posed the greatest risk.

With the press kept out, AMA leaders gave attendees lessons in public
relations and AMA-style realpolitik. Todd, AMA chief executive, said:
"There is a definite need to address and decrease the current public fear
and panic." He emphasized that no documentation existed of a medical
doctor infecting a patient with AIDS, and that any physician who admitted
he or she was HIV-positive would be destroyed professionally. "However,
it still seems reasonable and ethically correct to identify those few
procedures where transmission might be possible and ask for selfrestrictions.
... If we make any error, it must be in favor of the patient,"
he said.

Scott W. Wilber, director of the AMA's Department of Congressional
Relations, observed that Congress was in a mood to take some action:
"They \[Congress\] have to do something this year. They have to show
leadership and respond to their constituents." He told medical groups
that they needed to create the perception that "medicine cares about
more than their own self-status."[^9/35]

Perception and image, rather than science, were serving as the basis
for public-health policy at this point in the AMA mind. But it immediately
became obvious that in this policy battle, the AMA was going to
have problems trying to persuade the other groups to develop a list. The
would-be leader had virtually no followers. The only thing those in attendance
supported was the concept of educating the public and health
workers about HIV, hardly a policy breakthrough. They could not agree
on a list of "green light" or safe procedures, let alone on those that might
be amberor red-light procedures.

The AMA prefers to present a united front, but in this case seemed
to be sending out conflicting messages. Board member Dickey said the
AMA still was committed to the CDC plan to develop a list of risky,
exposure-prone procedures "to help reassure our patients that it is their
interest and well-being that AMA puts first." At the same time, AMA's
science vice president Schwarz said compiling such a list could make "the
situation worse, not better" by suggesting that the risk of contracting
HIV from an infected doctor was higher than it really was. [^9/36]

## THE BERGALISES HAVE THEIR SAY

As hearings were being organized in September 1991 on his bill to control
AIDS through mandatory testing of health workers and patients,
Congressman Dannemeyer charged that Health Subcommittee chairman
Henry A. Waxman, a liberal California congressman with a large
gay constituency, was attempting to prevent the dying Kimberly Bergalis
from testifying. Finally, Bergalis was scheduled to testify at the second
hearing on September 26. With massive media coverage, Bergalis rode a
train to Washington from her Florida home. Emaciated and exhausted,
she had to be brought into the hearing room in a wheelchair. Bergalis's
testimony was poignant, though brief: "I would like to say that AIDS is a
terrible disease which we must take seriously. I did nothing wrong, yet I
am being made to suffer like this. My life has been taken away. Please enact
legislation so no other patient or health-care provider will have to go
through the hell that I have. Thank you." It took fifteen seconds.

Her father, George Bergalis, minced no words: "Kimberly is the result
of ten years of protection, of covert action, of unwillingness to address
the real issue." He said Congress should start treating HIV/AIDS as
a health issue rather than a civil-rights issue. [^9/37] Others testified that widespread
testing of doctors and patients would be too costly, costing billions
and offering a false sense of security since HIV-negative one day
could be HIV-positive the next. Dannemeyer and his supporters counterattacked,
saying that testing can be done at a low cost as evidenced by
the U.S. military's testing of recruits.

Congress in October rejected the restrictive Helms and Dannemeyer
legislation. Instead, a bill written by the Senate leadership, which gave
the states leeway in developing policy, was passed by the House and soon
signed by President Bush. It required the states to adopt CDC guidelines
on dealing with infected health-care workers and exposure-prone procedures
or else lose vital federal funding. But the states were given
considerable leeway by allowing them to adopt guidelines that were the
_equivalent_ of CDC recommendations. This provision also took some
pressure off the CDC to develop a list of risky procedures, though the
agency officially continued to try to do so.

### Medical Groups Oppose the AMA Stand

Meanwhile, support for the list eroded even more among the medical societies.
The American Dental Association, which for the previous ten
months had repeatedly said it would produce a list of exposure-prone
procedures, saw the weakening resolve of other groups and on September
30 dropped the quest. It said there was no scientifically valid way to
compile a list.[^9/38]

A month later the American College of Surgeons, the largest organization
of surgeons, assaulted the CDC-requested plan, noting that a
dental extraction "is the only procedure that can be logically called
'risk prone.'" The College said it was "dismayed that insurers, licensing
bodies, government agencies and legislative bodies may propose regulations
based on the CDC guidelines, because such actions are not based on
direct scientific data; they are not cost effective; they are intrusive to the
extreme; and they are unable to achieve their desired intent."[^9/39]

Despite the rejection by other groups, the AMA kept trying to reassure
the public by promising to make a list of exposure-prone procedures.
Reacting to the American College of Surgeons'opposition, Dickey
said: "The general public, in response to both their concern for the disease
and how it has accelerated in response to the Bergalis case and others
in Florida, really don't care what the numeric risk is. They want some
form of guarantee. Until science can provide numbers that are reassuring
to the public and dictate clearly to the profession, the AMA will probably
continue its current policy."[^9/40]

By November 1991, when the CDC had hoped to publish final
guidelines, the AMA was the only major group left that endorsed the
CDC approach to compile a list of exposure-prone procedures. The
guidelines were ridiculed at a CDC-sponsored conference in November.
Dr. LaMar McGinnis, Jr., chairman of the AIDS committee of the American
College of Surgeons, charged that the plan involved "biopolitics"
rather than science. At the meeting, one-time supporters of the plan,
including the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, renounced
the concept of listing exposure-prone procedures. By December 1991
the CDC was sending out signals that it too was going to abandon support
for lists of exposure-prone procedures, and the AMA too was considering
backing off on the plan.

## THE AMA FLIP-FLOPS AGAIN ... AND AGAIN

Kimberly Bergalis died December 8, 1991.[^9/41] Her father warned physicians
and other health workers: "Someone who has AIDS and continues to
practice is nothing better than a murderer." He again urged that HIV
testing be required for both doctors and patients.

The next day, December 9, at the AMA meeting in Las Vegas, a committee
heard support for a report that would have rejected making a list
of exposure-prone procedures and would have made AMA policy consistent
with other major groups. But then word came out on December
10 that three patients might have been infected with HIV by a
Philadelphia surgeon. Mercy Catholic Medical Center, one hospital
where the surgeon had operated, conducted a "look-back" study of
330 patients to determine whether any of the doctor's patients were
infected. The research turned up the three surgical patients infected
with HIV.

Could this be the long-feared case of a medical doctor spreading
HIV to his patients? Should the AMA stand by its much-pilloried policy?
Or should it drop the policy and rejoin the rest of medicine?
On the verge of reversing a controversial policy it had promoted for
a year, the AMA leadership was spooked, even though the infections in
all three Philadelphia patients could be explained by their having engaged
in behaviors that put them at risk for HIV. The AMA Board met
late into the night and decided to recommend that the organization, at
least for the moment, should not drastically change its policies. AMA delegates
went along with the board and merely asked the medical community
to "determine if there is any scientific basis for the development
of a list" of exposure-prone procedures.[^9/42]

In the background, CDC officials had been conferring with the AMA
staff to try to find a way for the AMA to gracefully abandon its by now
highly embarrassing policies. In a memo to his staff, Dr. Gary Noble, deputy
director of the CDC, said, AMA science vice president "Roy Schwarz
called to say that, much to his chagrin" the AMA House had failed to
drop the proposal. "He hopes this can be repaired by passage of a new
resolution at the next meeting in June."[^9/43]

The AMA was left holding the bag. It didn't officially give up on the
concept until its annual meeting in June 1992, when it returned to the
position of saying that HIV-infected physicians should not be removed
from practice unless they posed a significant risk to public health, the
standard used under federal laws. According to Schwarz, the AMA had
"become more comfortable with the scientific conclusion that the risk
was very small. When that point occurred, then the policy was clarified
and everybody started singing completely from the same hymnal."[^9/44]

In the end, the AMA had little clout in gathering medicine's forces in
an important policy skirmish involving AIDS. Its position had been derided
as unscientific and as a ploy to alleviate perceived public fears
raised by an aberrational incident in which a dentist in an unexplained
fashion gave HIV infections to six patients. Look-back studies involving
more than 19,000 patients treated by infected surgeons have failed to
turn up patients whose doctors had infected them.[^9/45] The CDC eliminated
its call for a national list of exposure-prone procedures, and the
states had wide latitude to develop policy regarding HIV-infected workers.
The CDC recommended that HIV-infected health workers be handled
on a case-by-case basis and be permitted to stay on the job unless
they posed a danger to patients.[^9/46]

## THE WRONG QUESTION

The AMA had improperly framed debate on the issue, putting the public
and the medical profession through an unnecessarily difficult and
rancorous process. Dr. Mervyn Silverman, president of the American
Foundation for AIDS Research and former San Francisco health commissioner,
contended: "The AMA was asking the wrong question: 'What
do you do with the infected health-care worker?' They should have been
asking, 'How do you reduce the spread of blood-borne illnesses in a
health-care setting?'"[^9/47]

Plastic surgeon Dr. Jane Petro, a lesbian and president of the American
Association of Physicians for Human Rights in 1991, during the policy
debate in 1991 said that as a result of the furor created by the Acer
case there had been "a witch-hunt where a large number of people were
fired, either because they were perceived to possibly be gay or perceived
to possibly be HIV positive." Based on reports to her organization representing
gay and lesbian doctors, the Lambda Legal Foundation, and to
the American Civil Liberties Union, Petro estimated that up to 500 HIVinfected
physicians lost their positions.[^9/48]

The AMA's position of "tell or quit" contributed to the sacrifice of
these vulnerable physicians. The AMA had used a tenet of the Hippocratic
Oath, "First, do no harm," as its rationale to protect the public from
HIV-infected physicians. But this public-relations posture mainly served
to protect straight, uninfected physicians from mandatory testing. By
isolating the infected minority, the AMA gave the oath a new twist: do no
harm ... to the profession.

The AIDS crisis showed how the game of medical politics could get
in the way of sound public health policy and medical science. The AMA
argues that its response may have been slow, but no more so than other
institutions. Roy Schwarz said, "I think the AMA wasn't much different
than any other organization in society. First, we didn't know much about
it. We tried to scramble to catch up. We tried to educate physicians to the
best of our resources. We have not ducked a single tough issue in AIDS
from a policy standpoint. It hasn't always been easy to get to a consensus
and clear policy."[^9/49]

After breaking a virtual policy blackout in 1987, the AMA has had a
mixed record on AIDS, winning both high praise and scathing criticism.
Former surgeon general Koop said he was delighted by the AMA's "aggressive
action against AIDS and the willingness of the AMA Board of
Trustees to expend large amounts of money on their AIDS Action Plan,
which would include plans for education and projections about the
spread of the epidemic. The AMA may earn its share of criticism, but it
should be lauded for this private-sector effort of the doctors of America
against AIDS."[^9/50]

Advocates for people with AIDS also praised the AMA's 1987 amicus
brief which the Supreme Court adapted to provide guidelines by which
people with contagious diseases, including HIV, were protected against
discrimination under federal laws defending the rights of the handicapped.
However, responding to the Acer case in Florida, the AMA in
1991 ignored these standards in opposing HIV-infected physicians performing
invasive procedures.

The AMA looked after _healthy_ physicians, as reflected by the fact that
in 1991 it established a disability-insurance program to safeguard the incomes
of doctors who _become_ HIV-positive. It has done little to help those
unfortunate enough already to be HIV-positive. Benjamin Schatz, executive
director of the American Association of Physicians for Human
Rights in San Francisco, which runs a program to help HIV-positive physicians
stay on the job, said the AMA "has taken their HIV-positive colleagues
and thrown them to the wolves. They haven't done a damn thing
for them." He said the AMA gave $10,000 to AAPHR's Medical Expertise
Retention Program and refers HIV-infected doctors to his relatively
small organization rather than offering them services. [^9/51]

The AMA has issued many policy recommendations urging that
funds be made available for education and prevention of HIV as well as
calling for testing and protection of the rights of people infected with
HIV. But, in some important instances, the AMA came down on the side
of public relations and image rather than putting patients and science
first. During the AIDS crisis, the AMA too often was guilty of publichealth
malpractice.

In Congress, the AMA received some credit for lobbying successfully
on bills to fund AIDS research. But some lobbyists for gay groups contend
that the AMA for the most part has been MIA, missing in action, on
AIDS issues.

Larry Kramer, the playwright whose efforts led to the formation of a
leading social-service agency for the HIV-infected as well as ACT UP, in
an interview complained that doctors failed to use their considerable
moral power to bring about change. "The AMA's record on dealing with
AIDS has been frightful and shameful. More than anyone else, the doctors
in this country know how awful AIDS is and how pervasive it is, and
how dangerous it is, and how it is now a plague. And they have done precious
little to use that knowledge to pressure government to do anything
about it."[^9/52]
