## THE SUBJECTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW


INTERNATIONAL law is primarily concerned with the rights,
duties, and interests of States. Normally the rules of conduct
that it prescribes are rules which States are to observe, and in
the same way treaties may impose obligations which the
signatory States alone agree to perform. But this does not
necessarily imply that no other entities or persons, whether
natural or legal, can come within the dominion or bounty of
international law.[^62/1]

However, certain authorities assert that States are the only
subjects[^62/2] with which international law is concerned. A natural
stumbling block for so wide a theory has always been the case
of slaves and pirates. As a result of general treaties,[^62/3] certain
rights of protection, etc., have been bestowed on slaves by
the society of States. Also under customary rules of inter-
national law, individuals who commit the offence of piracy
_jure gentium_ on the high seas are liable as enemies of mankind
to punishment by any apprehending State.[^62/4] These two apparent
exceptions to the general rule have been reconciled by treating
slaves and pirates _jure gentium_ as objects, and in no sense as
subjects of international law. Moreover it has been said by
the same authorities that on a proper analysis, it would be
found that the so-called rights or duties of slaves and pirates
_jure gentium_ are technically those of States and States only.
Thus, in the case of slaves, it is argued, the international
Conventions under which slaves enjoy protection really cast
duties on the States parties; without such duties on the States
to recognise and protect their interests, slaves would not possess
any rights at international law.

As against this theory that individuals are only incumbents
of rights and duties at international law insofar as they are
objects and not subjects, there is a theory which goes to the
limit in the opposite direction. This theory which is held by
the noted jurist Kelsen and his followers maintains that in the
ultimate analysis, individuals alone are the subjects of inter-
national law. A faint version of this theory had already
appeared in the following passage in Westlake[^63/1]:---

> The duties and rights of States are only the duties and rights
of the men who compose them ".

Kelsen analyses the notion of a State, and affirms that it is
purely a technical legal concept serving to embrace the totality
of legal rules applying to a group of persons within a defined
territorial area; the State and the law may almost be described
as synonymous. The concept of the State is used to express
in technical language legal situations in which individuals alone
are bound to do certain acts or receive certain benefits in the
name of the collectivity of human beings to which they belong.[^63/2]
For instance, when we say that Great Britain is responsible at
international law for some wrong committed against another
State by one of its officials or a member of its armed forces,
this is only a technical method of expressing the fact that the
British people as a whole, i.e., the individuals subject to
British law, are bound through the persons who constitute its
Government to give redress for the wrong imputed to Great
Britain as a State. The duties resting on a State at inter-
national law are thus ultimately duties binding on individuals.
In this respect, according to Kelsen, there is no real
distinction between State law and international law. Both
systems bind individuals, although international law. as a
matter of technique does so only mediately and through the
concept of the State.

From the purely theoretical standpoint, and in logic,
Kelsen's views are undoubtedly correct. But as a matter
of practice, international lawyers and the statesmen they
advise, work on the realistic basis that their primary concern
is with the rights and duties of States. It is true that from
time to time treaties do provide that individuals may have
rights, a remarkable recent illustration being the 1965 Con-
vention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of other States, enabling private foreign
investors to have access to international machinery for the
settlement of their disputes with investment-receiving States.[^64/1]
But otherwise it will generally be found that treaty provisions
are couched in the form of rules of conduct binding upon, or
conferring rights on States. This is also consistent with the
long-standing British practice of treaty negotiation. The
Crown when negotiating treaties does not do so as trustee or
agent for private citizens. As Lord Atkin said in an important
judgment[^64/2]:---

>When the Crown is negotiating with another sovereign a
treaty, it is inconsistent with its sovereign position that it
should be acting as agent for the nationals of the sovereign
State, unless indeed the Crown chooses expressly to declare
that it is acting as agent".

At the same time, it serves no purpose to gloss over the
exceptions to the general working rule. There are cases where
international law binds individuals immediately and not merely
mediately in Kelsen's sense. It is a pure play on words to
say that slaves and pirates _jure gentium_ are not subjects, but
objects of international law. For example, the rule of inter-
national law by which States are authorised to attack, seize, and
punish pirates _jure gentium_, is a rule "imposing a legal duty
directly upon individuals and establishing individual respon-
sibility".[^65/1] It would be straining the facts to interpret the rule
as casting a duty not on individuals but on States, for no State
is bound to punish pirates if it chooses to abstain from doing so,
while the power to apprehend pirates is scarcely a right in its
proper connotation.

It is maintained by the protagonists of the traditional theory
that, in any event, such alleged exceptional cases are only in
fact apparent exceptions, for in essence the liability to punish-
ment of pirates _jure gentium_ and the right of slaves to their
freedom derives from municipal law, and not from international
law. They claim that generally no rule of international law
can operate directly or indirectly upon individuals without
some municipal legislative implementation of the rule.[^65/2] How-
ever, as to pirates _jure gentium_ Kelsen cogently says[^65/3]:---

>The fact that the specification of the punishment is left to
national law, and the trial of the pirate to national Courts,
does not deprive the delict and the sanction of their inter-
national character.

That is a consideration applicable to all the exceptional cases.

Irrespective of municipal legislative implementation of the
rules therein contained, there is no question that, however
exceptionally, many modern treaties do bestow rights or impose
duties upon individuals. It was authoritatively decided by the
Permanent Court of International Justice in the _Danzig Railway
Officials' Case_ that if by a particular treaty the parties intended
to confer rights on individuals, then these rights should receive
recognition and effect at international law, that is to say
from an international Court.[^65/4] In that case, Poland contended
that the agreement between herself and Danzig fixing the
conditions of employment of Danzig railway officials, whom
she had taken over, conferred no right of action on these
officials. She maintained that the agreement being an inter-
national treaty, and not having been incorporated into Polish
law, created rights and obligations only between the con-
tracting parties, and that failure to carry out such obligations
would involve her in responsibility only to Danzig and not to
private individuals. While the Permanent Court was ready
to admit this as a general rule, it declared that in the particular
case the intention of the parties was to create rights enforceable
by private citizens, and therefore the Danzig officials had their
cause of action against the Polish administration as under the
agreement. It may well be said that insofar as it purports to
confer rights upon individuals, the Geneva Prisoners of War
Convention of 1949 is such a treaty, within the meaning of the
Permanent Court's decision.

This controversy as to whether international law binds
individuals is by no means of theoretical significance only.
Towards the end of the Second World War when the Allies
were concerting measures to prosecute war criminals, there was
some hesitation whether international law could indeed reach
out to punish Heads of State, Ministers, and high military and
administrative functionaries responsible for initiating the war
and authorising the perpetration of atrocities. In the event,
the theoretical objections to such a course were disregarded,
and pursuant to agreements to this effect which were without
precedent in international law,[^66/1] international trial tribunals
were set up at Nuremberg and Tokyo. Among the offences
for which charges were laid were crimes against peace (for
example, beginning a war of aggression or in violation of
treaties), crimes against humanity (for example, murder or
persecution of racial or religious groups), crimes under the
laws of war, and the conspiracy to commit these crimes. The
judgment of the Nuremberg International Tribunal in 1946
(followed later by the judgment in 1948 of the Tokyo Inter-
national Tribunal) establishing the guilt of certain of the
defendants in respect of these charges, and affirming their
individual responsibility under international law, is of historic
significance. The principles of international law recognised
in the Agreement or Charter setting up the Tribunal of August
8, 1945,[^67/1] and in the Tribunal's Judgment were subsequently
formulated by the International Law Commission of the United
Nations as a Draft Code on Offences against the Peace and
Security of Mankind (_see_ Report concerning the work of its
second session presented to the General Assembly in 1950).
In these principles, as formulated, the references are to per-
sons" as being guilty of crimes against the peace and security
of mankind. In the light of these principles, too, one point
has been clarified, namely that international law can reach
over and beyond traditional technicalities, and prevent guilty
individuals sheltering behind the abstract concept of the State.[^67/2]
According to the Nuremberg Tribunal[^67/3]:---

>Crimes against international law are committed by men,
not by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who
commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be
enforced".

This trend of international law towards attaching direct
responsibility to individuals was reaffirmed in the Genocide
Convention adopted by the United Nations General Assembly
on December 9, 1948, which is somewhat in advance of the
Nuremberg principles.[^68/1] Under the Convention, the States
Parties agreed that genocide (i.e., acts committed with intent
to destroy in whole or in part national, ethnical, racial, or
religious groups) and the conspiracy or incitement to commit
genocide, attempts, and complicity therein, should be punish-
able on trial by national courts or by an international criminal
tribunal. Article IV of the Convention emphasised the aspect
of individual responsibility by providing that _persons_ com-
mitting the Acts should be punished "whether they are
constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private
individuals".

These developments lay in the direction of imposing duties
on individuals under international law.

But parallel thereto, there has been also a movement for
conferring rights on individuals, even as against States of which
such individuals are nationals or citizens. This is implicit in
the Nuremberg judgment of 1946, inasmuch as it recognises
that the victims of crimes against humanity committed even
by their own Governments, are entitled to the protection of
international criminal law. So also does the Genocide Con-
vention of 1948 purport to protect the very right of human
groups to exist as groups. In this connection reference must
be made to the movement to protect human rights and funda-
mental freedoms sponsored by the United Nations under the
powers given in Article 1 and other provisions of the United
Nations Charter, a subject which is discussed in a later Chapter.[^68/2]
In Europe the human rights movement has been advanced as a
result of the European Convention for the Protection of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed at Rome on Novem-
ber 4, 1950.[^68/3] Under the Convention, there were established
a European Commission of Human Rights with administrative
power to investigate and report on violations of human rights,
and a European Court of Human Rights, which commenced
to function in 1959, and in several cases already,[^69/1] both the
Commission and the Court have inquired into a violation of
human rights alleged by an individual against his own Govern-
ment.

In regard to individuals in general, it should be noted that
there is a widely recognised rule of international practice that
before an international tribunal, the rights of, or the obligations
binding individuals at international law, are respectively
enforceable at the instance of or against those States only
whose nationality such individuals possess.[^69/2] In other words
an individual cannot generally assert his own rights against a
State before an international tribunal or be answerable to a
State in the same jurisdiction for failing in his obligations, but
only through the State of which he is a national.

The European Court of Human Rights does not represent an
exception to the rule, as the parties to the European Conven-
tion for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms, and the European Commission of Human Rights
have alone the right to bring a case before the court. Indivi-
duals cannot of their own motion invoke the Court's jurisdiction.

Certain points require emphasis in this connection. In the
first place, the rule precluding an individual from approaching
an international tribunal is one of a general nature only, and
already certain exceptions to it have appeared. Thus, by treaties
concluded after the First World War (_see_ Articles 297 and 304
of the Treaty of Versailles, 1919, and the Polish-German
Convention of May 15, 1922, relating to Upper Silesia[^69/3])
individual claimants were allowed access to the various Mixed
Arbitral Tribunals set up pursuant to the provisions of these
instruments, although as it turned out Governments intervened
in some of the more important cases in support of their nationals.
Again, under the Treaty creating the European Coal and Steel
Community of April 18, 1951, under the Treaty establishing the
European Economic Community (Common Market) of March
25, 1957, and under the Treaty establishing the European
Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) of March 25, 1957,
individuals, private enterprises, and corporate entities have been
given certain rights of direct appeal to the Court of Justice of
the Communities against decisions of organs of the Com-
munities. Mention may also be made of the right of United
Nations Officials to take proceedings before the United Nations
Administrative Tribunal for alleged non-observance of their
contracts of employment or the terms of their appointment.
Moreover, the opinion of many international lawyers is that,
in certain limited cases, access by individuals or corporations
to international tribunals is necessary and should be allowed,
and it may be expected that in the future changes in this
direction will come about.[^70/1] Second, the fact that individuals
have such procedural incapacities before international tribunals
is not necessarily inconsistent with their status as subjects of
international law. There are similar instances of persons with
procedural incapacities before municipal Courts (for example,
infants, who under English law can only bring an action by a
next friend or defend it by a guardian _ad litem_), who are never-
theless regarded as subjects of municipal law. Third, the
International Court of Justice has held[^70/2] that an international
institution, as distinct from a State, is entitled to espouse the
claim of one of its officials against a State for damage or injury
suffered, thus recognising that, at all events, this function of
protection does not belong exclusively to States.

International practice has in recent years extended the range
of subjects far beyond that of States only:---

(a) International institutions and organs, such as the United
Nations and the International Labour Organisation (ILO)
were established under international Conventions containing
constitutional provisions regulating their duties and functions,
for example, the United Nations Charter, 1945, and the Con-
stitution of the International Labour Organisation.

In its Advisory Opinion just mentioned the International
Court of Justice expressly held, in terms which are applic-
able to other international organisations, that the United
Nations is, under international law, an international person.
According to the Court[^71/1]:---

> That is not the same thing as saying that it is a State, which
it certainly is not, or that its legal personality and rights and
duties are the same as those of a State.... What it does mean
is that it is a subject of international law and capable of possessing
international rights and duties, and that it has capacity to
maintain its rights by bringing international claims.

Moreover within the United Nations and the International
Labour Organisation, for example, are other organs, and even
individuals,[^71/2] whose activities are regulated by rules set out in
these constitutional intruments.

Even regional international organisations and Communities
(e.g., the European Economic Community) may by the terms of
their constituent instruments be endowed with international
personality, as, for example, the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
sation (NATO), which possesses "juridical personality" under
Article 4 of the Agreement of September 20, 1951 on the Status
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, National Represen-
tatives, and International Staff.

It should be mentioned, however, that some positivist writers
oppose the attribution of international personali to inter-
national institutions, and maintain what is known as a theory
of "commion organs" Under this theory international
organisations are regarded as domestic institutions common to
the participating States, and whose activities are in essence the
activities of these States, and not as true international agencies.
It is difficult to reconcile such a conception of the status of
international institutions with all the facts, and in the South
West Africa Cases, 2nd Phase (1966),[^72/1] the International Court
of Justice, dealing with the League of Nations, ruled that
individual member States had, with reference to mandates, no
separate, self-contained right they could assert before a Court,
over and above the League's collective, institutional activity.

(b) Several "law-making Conventions have been con-
cluded in regard to matters of international criminal law,
for example, the Geneva Conventions dealing with the Sup-
pression of Counterfeiting Currency (1929), and with the
Suppression of the International Drug Traffic (1936), the
Single Narcotic Drugs Convention adopted at New York in
1961, the Tokyo Convention on Offences and Other Acts
Committed on board Aircraft (1963), and the Hague Con-
vention for the Suppression of the Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft
(1970). Under these Conventions, States have concerted or
may concert their action for the punishment of certain inter-
national offences or crimes in which individuals alone were
concerned. Thereby, delinquents such as international drug
traffickers and counterfeiters, and persons" hijacking" an
aircraft, have become subjects of conventional rules of inter-
national criminal law in much the same way as pirates _jure
gentium_ under customary rules.

(c) Under treaties concerning national minorities, individuals,
as already mentioned, were given the right of securing redress
by application to an international Court (_see_, for example,
Articles 297 and 304 of the Treaty of Versailles, 1919).

(d) Subdivisions of States,[^72/2] dependencies, protectorates, and
territories were brought within the scope of several " law-
making " Conventions, in order better to secure the working
of the provisions of these Conventions which required applica-
tion by all administrative units throughout the world, whether
States, colonies, protectorates, or territories. An appropriate
example is the provision in Article 8 of the Constitution of the
World Health Organisation of 1946 that territories or groups
of territories "not responsible for the conduct of their inter-
national relations " may be admitted as Associate Members of
that Organisation.

(e) Insurgents as a group may be granted belligerent rights
in a contest with the legitimate Government, although not in
any sense organised as a State.[^73/1]

A further significant point, often lost sight of, is the fact
that international law is not solely concerned with advancing
the political interests of States, but to a large extent also with
the interests and needs of individuals and non-State entities.
So it is that a primary aim of many notable " law-making
Conventions of the past seventy years, including such instru-
ments as the Geneva Prisoners of War Convention of 1949 and
the Geneva Convention of 1949 for the Protection of Civilian
Persons in Time of War, and the large number of Conventions
adopted by the Conferences of the International Labour
Organisation, has been the welfare and health of the individual.
Moreover, a number of international organisations are speci-
fically devoted to advancing and ensuring respect for the rights
and interests of individuals, in effect taking over, to some
extent, internationally, the functions of diplomatic protection
formerly performed by States. It would not therefore be a very
revolutionary step if one further step were to be taken, and inter-
national law were to confer rights on individuals directly and _ex
proprio vigore_ without necessarily operating for this purpose
through the medium and under the cover of the State. So far, it
is only in exceptional cases that such an advance has been
made.

Then, as a final point, there is the fact that a considerable
weight of contemporary opinion, represented particularly by
the newly emerged States, favours the view that peoples as such
have certain inalienable rights under international law, among
which are the right to self-determination, the right freely to
choose their political, economic and social systems, and the
right to dispose of the natural wealth and resources of the
territory occupied by them. Obviously this conception of the
inalienable rights of peoples as such conflicts with the traditional
doctrine that States are the exclusive subjects of international
law. These rights of peoples as such were recognised in the
Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning
Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accord-
ance with the United Nations Charter, adopted by the General
Assembly in 1970, where the Declaration elaborates in detail
the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.
In its Advisory Opinion of June 21, 1971, on the Legal Con-
sequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa
in South West Africa (Namibia), the International Court of
Justice treated the people of the Mandated Territory of South
West Africa as having, in effect, rights at international law,
including a right of progress towards independence, which had
been violated by South Africa's failure as Mandatory Power
to comply with its obligations to submit to the supervision of
United Nations organs (_see_ I.C.J. Reports, 1971, 16, at p. 56,
where the Court referred to the people of the Territory as a
"jural entity" and as an " injured entity ").

To sum up, it may be said:---

(a) That under modern practice,
the number of exceptional instances of individuals or non-State
entities enjoying rights or becoming subject to duties directly
under international law, has grown.

(b) That the doctrinaire
rigidity of the procedural convention precluding an individual
from prosecuting a claim under international law except
through the State of which he is a national, has been to some
extent tempered.

(c) That the interests of individuals, their
fundamental rights and freedoms, etc., have become a primary
concern of international law.

These and other developments of recent years[^75/1] appear to
show that the theory that States are the exclusive subjects of
international law cannot be accepted today as accurate in all
respects, although it may be a good working generalisation
for the practical international lawyer. The use of the State
as a medium and screen for the application of international
law cannot now do justice to all the far-reaching aims of the
modern system.

Yet it is as wrong to minimise this traditional theory as
artificially to explain away the developments that have subjected
the theory to such strain. The bulk of international law
consists of rules which bind States, and it is only in the minority
of cases, although it is a substantial minority, that lawyers have
to concern themselves with individuals and non-State entities
as subjects of international law.

and Supranational Tribunals (1966); Nørgaard, The Position of the Individual

[^62/2]: The term "subject of international law" is capable of meaning:---

    (a) an
    incumbent of rights and duties under international law;
    
    (b) the holder of a
    procedural privilege of prosecuting a claim before an international tribunal;
    and
    
    (c) the possessor of interests for which provision is made by international
    law. These three meanings are not always kept distinct in the literature on
    the question whether individuals and non-State entities may be subjects of
    international law.

[^66/1]: The Agreement for setting up the Nuremberg Tribunal, dated August 8,
1945, between Great Britain, the United States, France, and Russia provided
in Article 7 of the Charter annexed thereto that:---

    ... The official position of the defendants, whether as Heads of
    State or responsible officials in Government Departments, shall not be
    considered as freeing them from responsibility or mitigating punishment".
    _Cf._ the Charter of January 19, 1946, concerning the constitution of the
    Tokyo Tribunal.

[^67/1]: Some writers questioned the validity and propriety of the Tribunal,
as well as the legality of conferring upon it, by Agreement of the Four Powers
(i.e., Great Britain, the United States, France, and Russia), jurisdiction to
deal with certain offences against the law of nations, formulated for the first
time in such Agreenient, e.g., crimes against the peace, and crimes against
humanity. _Cf._ Kelsen, International Law Quarterly (1947), Vol. I, pp. 153 _et seq._

[^67/2]: The Nuremberg Tribunal rejected the argument urged on behalf of the
defendants that they were being prosecuted for international crimes under
rules of law ex post facto inasmuch as prior to 1939--1940, such crimes as
crimes against the peace had not been defined or made punishable under
existing international law. It pointed out that the defendants must have
known that their actions were illegal and wrong, and in defiance of inter-
national law (_see_ Official Record of Trials, Vol. I, Official Documents, at p. 219).
This ruling has been widely criticised; for typical criticism and discussion,
_see_ Finch, American Journal of International Law (1947), Vol. 41, at pp. 33

[^67/3]: _See_ Official Record, Vol. I, Official Documents, at p. 223. The Tribunal
also pointed out that it had long been recognised that "international law
imposes duties and liabilities upon individuals as well as upon States ".

[^68/1]: Note that in respect of the crimes against humanity as charged before the
Nuremberg Tribunal, the Tribunal limited its jurisdiction over these to such as
were committed in connection with or in execution of crimes against peace,
or war crimes proper.

[^69/3]: Under this Convention, the independent procedural capacity of individuals
as claimants before an international tribunal was recognised even as against
the State of which they were nationals; _see_ Steiner and Gross v. Polish State
(1928), Annual Digest of Public International Law Cases, 1927--1928, Case
No. 188.

[^70/1]: An early precedent also is that of the Central American Court of Justice
(1908--1918), which did have jurisdiction to deal with disputes between States
and private individuals, although no significant conclusions can be drawn
from its meagre record of activity over a period of ten years.

Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, a constituent sub-
division of a State party (e.g. a province or State of a Federation) may, with
the approval of that State, go to arbitration or conciliation with an investor
of another State party (_see_ article 8).

[^73/1]: Another instance is the status of the Holy See as a subject of international
law from 1871 to 1929, before the Lateran Treaties; as to which _see_ Kunz,

Governments in exile, as during the Second World War, _see_ F. Ē. Oppenheim,

Tribunal that the Sovereign Order of Malta is a subject of international law;
_see_ Cartolari v. Sovereign Order of Malta, Annali di Diritto Internazionale
(1951), Vol. IX, p. 153. A further case of a non-State entity, which is possibly
a subject of international law, is that of the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC); _see_ Kunz, American Journal of International Law (1959),
Vol. 53 at no. 132.

[^75/1]: One interesting development was the conclusion in February and Novem-
ber, 1965 of educational and cultural agreements between France and the
Canadian province of Quebec, with provision for a supervisory France-
Quebec Co-operation Commission. True, this was with the concurrence of
the Canadian Government, but in the result a component of a Federation was
brought within the range of international law. _See_ Fitzgerald, American
Journal of International Law, Vol. 60 (1966), pp. 529--531. A later develop-
ment was the conclusion in September, 1969, of a Quebec-Louisiana Cultural
