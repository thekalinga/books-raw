THE AGENTS OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
DIPLOMATIC ENVOYS, CONSULS, AND
OTHER REPRESENTATIVES
1.- DIPLOMATIC ENVOYS
Nearly all States today are represented in the territory of
foreign States by diplomatic envoys and their staffs. Such
diplomatic missions are of a permanent character, although
the actual occupants of the office may change from time to
time. Consequent on a development over some hundreds of
years, the institution of diplomatic representatives has come to
be the principal machinery by which the intercourse between
States is conducted.
In fact, however, the general rise of permanent as distinct
from temporary diplomatic missions dates only from the
seventeenth century. The rights, duties, and privileges of
diplomatic envoys continued to develop according to custom
in the eighteenth century, and by the early nineteenth century
the time was ripe for some common understanding on the
subject, which as we shall _see_, took place at the Congress of
Vienna in 1815. Developments in diplomatic practice since
1815 rendered necessary a new and more extensive codification
of the laws and usages as to diplomatic envoys, which was
achieved in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations
concluded on April 18, 1961.1 Customary international law
will, however, continue to govern questions not expressly regu-
lated by the Convention (_see_ Preamble).

Classification of Diplomatic Envoys
Originally, some controversy centred around the classification
of diplomatic representatives, particularly as regards matters
of precedence and relative status. Ambassadors sent on a
temporary mission were called " Extraordinary" as contrasted
with resident envoys. Later the title
Later the title "Extraordinary" was
given to all Ambassadors whether resident or temporary,
and the title of " Plenipotentiary" was added to their
designation. In its literal sense the term " Plenipotentiary"
signified that the envoy was fully empowered to transact
business on behalf of the Head of State who had sent him on
the mission.
The designation " Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Pleni-
potentiary came to be applied to almost all diplomatic
representatives of the first rank, such as Ambassadors and
Ministers, with the exception of Ministers resident. This
titular nomenclature survives today, although the reasons for
its use are not commonly appreciated.
The Congress of Vienna in 1815 attempted to codify the
classifications and order of precedence of diplomatic envoys.
This codification, better known as the " Regulation of Vienna ",
was, subject to certain adjustments, incorporated in the pro-
visions of Articles 14 to 18 of the Vienna Convention on Diplo-
matic Relations of April 18, 1961. According to these provi-
sions, heads of diplomatic mission are divided into three
classes:

(1) Ambassadors or nuncios accredited to Heads of State,
and other heads of mission of equivalent rank.1

(2) Envoys, ministers, and internuncios accredited to Heads
of State.
1 This class does not include Legates, as previously under the Regulation
of Vienna, because the new codification purports to deal only with heads of
mission. Also, the provisions of Article 2 of the Regulation of Vienna that
only Ambassadors, Legates, or nuncios should possess the representative
character in relation to the accrediting Head of State, were not adopted.
No provision was made for the class of " Ministers resident", which was
established by the Conference at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, in modification of
the Regulation of Vienna. As to this former class, _see_ Twiss, The Law of
Nations (2nd. edition, 1884) Vol. I, at p. 344.

Part 4.--International Transactions

(3) Chargés d'affuires accredited to Ministers for Foreign
Affairs,
Except in matters of precedence and etiquette", there is to be
no differentiation between heads of mission by reason of their
class. The class to which heads of their missions are to be
assigned is to be agreed between States. Heads of mission are
to take precedence in their respective classes in the order of the
date and time of taking up their functions; for this purpose, they
are considered as taking up their functions either when they
have presented their credentials, or when they have notified
their arrival and a true copy of their credentials has been
presented to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the receiving
State, or other Ministry according to the practice of this State.
Alterations in the credentials of a head of mission not involving
any change of class, are not to affect his precedence. These
provisions as to precedence are to be without prejudice to any
practice of the receiving State regarding the precedence of
the representative of the Holy See. The procedure to be
observed in each State for the reception of heads of mission is
to be uniform in respect of each class.
The attribution of the title of Ambassador, as distinct from
Minister, to the head of a diplomatic mission depends on various
factors, including the rank of the States concerned. Sometimes
an embassy is a matter of tradition, as for example between
France and Switzerland. Usually, however, now, the popula-
tion and importance of the country of mission are the deter-
mining factors. There are none the less many cases of
anomalies in the allocation of embassies, which reflect a lack
of uniformity of practice.
An envoy on an ad hoc mission is usually furnished with a
1 " Etiquette " includes ceremonial matters, and matters of conduct or
protocol.
2 In its Report, _op. cit._, the International Law Commission made significant
mention of the growing tendency of most States today to appoint Ambassadors,
rather than Ministers, as heads of missions. The titular rank of Minister is
now, in fact, being used more and more for a responsible or senior member
of the legation.

document of Full Powers? setting out his authority which in due
course he presents to the authorities of the State with whom
negotiations are to be conducted, or to the Committee on Full
Powers of the Conference at which he is to represent his
country.
Appointment and Reception of Diplomatic Envoys
The machinery of diplomacy used to be attended by a
good deal of ceremony and ritual, and to a certain extent this
still applies. Ceremonial procedure, for instance, is generally
observed in regard to the arrival and departure of diplomatic
envoys.
The appointment of an individual as Ambassador or Minister
is usually announced to the State to which he is accredited in
certain official papers, with which the envoy is furnished,
known as Letters of Credence or Lettres de Créance; these are
for remission to the receiving State. Apart from the Letters of
Credence the envoy may take with him documents of Full
Powers relating to particular negotiations or other specific
written instructions.
States may refuse to receive diplomatic envoys either :---


(a) generally, or in respect to a particular mission of negotia-
tion; or (b) because a particular envoy is not personally
acceptable. In the latter case, the State declining to accept
the envoy is not compelled to specify its objections to the
accreditation or to justify them (_see_ Article 4 paragraph 2 of
the Vienna Convention). Consequently, to avoid any such
conflict arising, a State wishing to appoint a particular
person as envoy must ascertain beforehand whether he will
be persona gruta. Once such assent or agrément is obtained,
the accrediting State is safe in proceeding with the formal
appointment of its envoy. None the less, at any later time, the
receiving State may, without having to explain its decision,
notify the sending State that the envoy is persona non grata, in
which case he is recalled, or his functions terminated (Article 9
of the Vienna Convention).

Part 4.-International Transactions
Rights, Privileges, and Immunities of Diplomatic Envoys.1
These are primarily based on the need to ensure the efficient
performance of the functions of diplomatic missions (_see_
Preambie to Vienna Convention), and to a secondary
degree on the theory that a diplomatic mission personifies the
sending State (the "representative character " theory). The
theory of "exterritoriality", whereby the legation premises
represent an extension of the sending State's territory, may now
be discarded for all practical purposes. In the Australian case
of Ex parte Petroff (1971, unreported), where two persons had
been charged with throwing explosive substances at the
Chancery of the Soviet Union's Embassy in Canberra, in the
Australian Capital Territory, it was sought to argue in pre-
rogative writ proceedings that the magistrate concerned had no
jurisdiction to deal with the alleged offences as these were
committed on foreign territory. Fox, J., of the Supreme Court
of the Australian Capital Territory, rejected this contention and
expressly held, after a full review of the authorities, that an
embassy is not a part of the territory of the sending State, and
that the accused could be prosecuted for such alleged offences
against the local law.
As we have seen, diplomatic envoys enjoy exemption from
local civil and criminal jurisdiction.
They also have a right to inviolability of the person. This
protects them from molestation of any kind, and of course from
arrest or detention by the local authorities (_see_ Article 29 of
the Vienna Convention). Inviolability attaches likewise to the
legation premises and the archives and documents of the
legation (_see_ Articles 22 and 24 of the Vienna Convention).
Articles 34 and 36 of the Vienna Convention provide
that diplomatic agents are exempt from all dues and taxes,
other than certain taxes and charges set out in Article 34 (e.g.
1 Articles 20 to 41 of the Vienna Convention deal with these rights, privileges,
and immunities in detail. Considerations of space have precluded a full
treatment in the text, or an examination of the position of the subordinate
personnel of diplomatic missions, as provided for in the Convention.
2 _See above_ pp. 259--261.
3 As to the exemption in respect of the legation premises, _see_ Article 23 of
the Vienna Convention.

charges for services rendered), and also from customs duties.
The latter exemption was formerly a matter of comity or
reciprocity.
A new right is conferred by Article 26 of the Convention,
namely a right of members of a diplomatic mission to move and
travel freely in the territory of the receiving State, except in
prohibited security zones. Other privileges and immunities
dealt with in detail in the Convention include the freedom of
communication for official purposes (Article 27), exemption
from social security provisions (Article 33), and exemption
from services and military obligations (Article 35).
Termination of Diplomatic Mission
A diplomatic mission may come to an end in various
ways:

(1) Recall of the envoy by his accrediting State. The letter
of recall is usually handed to the Head of State or to the Minister
of Foreign Affairs in solemn audience, and the envoy receives
in return a Lettre de Récréance acknowledging his recall. In
certain circumstances, the recall of an envoy will have the
gravest significance; for example, where it is intended to
warn the receiving State of the accrediting State's dissatisfaction
with their mutual relations. Such a step is only taken where
the tension between the two States cannot otherwise be resolved.

(2) Notification by the sending State to the receiving State
that the envoy's function has come to an end (Article 43 of the
Vienna Convention).

(3) A request by the receiving State that the envoy be
recalled. This is equally a step of grave significance inasmuch
as it may presage a rupture of diplomatic relations.

(4) Delivery of passports to the envoy and his staff and suite
by the receiving State, as when war breaks out between the
accrediting and receiving States.

(5) Notification by the receiving State to the sending State,
where the envoy has been declared persona non grata and
where he has not been recalled or his functions terminated,
S.I.L.-14

that it refuses to recognise him as a member of the mission
(Articles 9 and 43 of the Vienna Convention).

(6) Fulfilment of the object of the mission.

(7) Expiration of Letters of Credence given for a limited
period only.
2.-CONSULS
Consuls are agents of a State in a foreign country, but not
diplomatic agents. Their primary duty in such capacity is to
protect the commercial interests of their appointing State,
but commonly a great variety of other duties are performed
by them for the subjects of their State; for example, the
execution of notarial acts, the granting of passports, the
solemnisation of marriages, and the exercise of a disciplinary
jurisdiction over the crews of vessels belonging to the State
appointing them.
The laws and usages as to the functions, immunities, etc.
of consuls were codified, subject to certain adaptations, altera-
tions, and extensions, in the Vienna Convention of April 24,
1963, on Consular Relations (based on Draft Articles adopted
in 1961 by the International Law Commission). The Con-
vention covers a wide field, but does not preclude States from
concluding treaties to confirm, supplement, extend, or amplify
its provisions (Article 73), and matters not expressly regulated
by the Convention are to continue to be governed by customary
international law (_see_ Preamble).
The institution of consuls is much older than that of
diplomatic representatives, but the modern system actually
dates only from the sixteenth century. Originally consuls
were elected by the merchants resident in a foreign country
from among their own number, but later the Great Powers
established salaried consular services and consuls were des-
patched to different countries according to the requirements
· Formerly, in certain countries, consuls exercised extra-territorial juris-
diction over their fellow-nationals to the exclusion of local municipal Courts.
As to this, _see_ the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Case
Concerning Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco,
I.C.J. Reports (1952), 176, at pp. 198 _et seq._

------
Chap. 14.---The Agents of International Business 391
of the service. Consuls are frequently stationed in more than
one city or district in the State to which they are sent, thus
differing from diplomatic envoys. There are, of course, other
differences. Consuls are not equipped with Letters of Credence,
but are appointed under a commission issued by their Govern-
ment; the appointment is then notified to the State where the
consul is to be stationed, the Government of which is
requested
to issue an exequatur or authorisation to carry out the consular
duties. If there is no objection to the appointment of the
person concerned as consul, the exequatur is issued. Normally
a consul does not enter on his duties until the grant of an
exequatur. If, subsequently, his conduct gives serious grounds
for complaint, the receiving State may notify the sending State
that he is no longer acceptable; the sending State must then
recall him or terminate his functions, and if the sending State
does not do so, the receiving State may withdraw the exequatur,
or cease to consider him as a member of the consulate. Article 23
of the Vienna Convention of 1963, goes much further than
this accepted practice, permitting a receiving State at any
time to notify the sending State that a consular officer is not
persona grata, or that any other member of the consular staff is
not acceptable.
Heads of consular posts are divided into four classes :---


(a) Consuls-general. (b) Consuls. (c) Vice-consuls. (d) Con-
sular agents (_see_ Article 9 of the Vienna Convention of 1963,
_ante_). Generally speaking, they take precedence according to
the date of grant of the exequatur.
Rights and Privileges of Consuls
Consuls seldom have direct communication with the Govern-
ment of the State in which they are stationed except where
their authority extends over the whole area of that State,
or where there is no diplomatic mission of their country in
the State. More usually such communication will be made
through an intermediate channel, for example, the diplomatic
envoy of the State by which they are appointed. The procedure
is governed by any applicable treaty, or by the municipal law

------

and usage of the receiving State (_see_ Article 38 of the Vienna
Convention of 1963).
As pointed out abovel consuls do not, like diplomatic
envoys, enjoy complete immunity from local jurisdiction.
Commonly, special privileges and exemptions are granted to
them under bilateral treaty, and these may include immunity
from process in the territorial Courts. Apart from this it
is acknowledged that as to acts performed in their official
capacity and falling within the functions of consular officers
under international law, they are not subject to local pro-
ceedings unless their Government assents to the proceedings
being taken.
In practice a great number of privileges have attached
themselves to the consular office. In the absence of such
privileges, consuls would not be able properly to fulfil their
duties and functions, and accordingly as a matter of convenience
they have become generally recognised by all States. Examples
of such privileges are the consul's exemption from service on
juries, his right of safe conduct, the right of free communication
with nationals of the sending State, the inviolability of his official
papers and archives, and his right if accused of a crime to be
released on bail or kept under surveillance until his exequatur
is withdrawn or another consul appointed in his place. Certain
States also grant consuls a limited exemption from taxation
and customs dues.
In general, however, the privileges of consuls under customary
international law are less settled and concrete than those of
1 _See above_, p. 264.
2 There is, _semble_, no such corresponding general inviolability of the
consular premises, nor are such premises extra-territorial in the sense that
consuls may there exercise police powers, exclusive of the local authorities,
over the citizens of their State. Thus, in 1948, in the Kasenkina Case in the
United States, where a Russian woman, presumably detained by Soviet
consular officers, jumped to the street from the window of a room in the
Soviet Consulate, the United States Government insisted on the position that
consular premises were subject to local police control in a proper case; _cf._
Preuss, American Journal of International Law (1949), Vol. 43, pp. 37--56. But
_see now_ the rule of inviolability of consular premises laid down in Article 31
of the Vienna Convention of 1963; this prohibits authorities of the receiving
State from entering, without consent, only that part of the consular premises
used exclusively for the work of the consular post, and provides that consent
to enter may be assumed in case of fire or other disaster requiring prompt
protective action.

------
Chap. 14.---The Agents of International Business 393
diplomatic envoys, although in the Vienna Convention of
April 24, 1963, referred to, _ante_, it was sought to extend to
consuls mutatis mutandis, the majority of the rights, privileges,
and immunities applying under the Vienna Convention on
Diplomatic Relations of April 18, 1961, subject to adjustments
in the case of honorary consuls. In that connection, it is
significant that in recent years, both Great Britain' and the
United States have negotiated standard consular Conventions
or treaties with a number of States in order that the rights and
privileges of consuls may be defined with more certainty, and
placed on as wide and secure a basis as possible.
The modern tendency of States is to amalgamate their
diplomatic and consular services, and it is a matter of frequent
occurrence to find representatives of States occupying, inter-
changeably or concurrently, a diplomatic and consular posts.
Under the impact of this tendency, the present differences
between diplomatic and consular privileges may gradually be
narrowed.
3.-SPECIAL MISSIONS OF A NON-PERMANENT NATURE
In addition to their permanent diplomatic and consular
representation, States are often obliged to send temporary
missions to particular States to deal with a specific question or
to perform a specific task, and such missions may be accredited,
irrespective of whether in point of fact permanent diplomatic or
consular relations are being maintained with the receiving
State. Of course, it is fundamental that a special mission of
this nature may be sent only with the consent of the State which
is to receive it.
The rules governing the conduct and treatment of these
special missions of a non-permanent character were the subject
1 _Cf._ the series of such consular treaties concluded by Great Britain with
Norway, the United States, France, Switzerland, Greece, Mexico, Italy,
the Federal Republic of Germany, and other States.
* _See_, e.g., Engelke v. Musmann, [1928] A.C. 433. Consular functions may be
  performed by a diplomatic mission; _see_ Article 3 paragraph 2 of the Vienna Con-
  vention on Diplomatic Relations, _supra_. Similarly, diplomatic functions may be
  carried out by a Consular Officer (not necessarily a head of the post) in a State,
  where the sending State has no diplomatic mission, and with the consent of the
  receiving State; _see_ Article 17 of the Vienna Convention of 1963.

------
394
Part 4.- International Transactions
of a Convention on Special Missions adopted by the United
Nations General Assembly on December 8, 1969, and opened
for signature on December 16, 1969. The Convention was
based on the final set of draft articles prepared in 1967 by the
International Law Commission, which had had the subject
under consideration since 1958.1
The Convention is largely modelled on provisions of the
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961, while
there has also been some borrowing from the text of the Vienna
Convention on Consular Relations of 1963. No distinction
was made by the Convention between special missions of a
technical nature and those of a political character, and its
provisions apply also to the so-called " high level" special
missions, that is missions led by heads of State or Cabinet
Ministers, subject however to the special recognition of the
privileged status of the leader of the mission in such a case.
Privileges and immunities are conferred upon the members of
special missions to an extent similar to that accorded to per-
manent diplomatic missions, the justification being that the
like privileges and immunities are essential for the regular and
efficient performance of the tasks and responsibilities of special
missions (_see_ seventh recital of the preamble to the Con-
vention).
The Convention on Special Missions of 1969 contains, inter
alia, the following provisions which differentiate it from the
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961, while at
the same time reflecting differences between the nature of
special missions, on the one hand, and that of permanent
diplomatic missions, on the other hand:a) Two or more
States may each send a special mission at the same time to
another State in order to deal together with a question of
common interest to all of them (Article 6). (b) Before appoint-
ing members of a special mission, the sending State must inform
the receiving State of the size of the mission, and of the names
and designations of its members (Article 8). (c) The seat of the
mission is to be in a locality agreed by the States concerned, or,
1 For text of draft articles and commentary thereon, _see_ Report of the
Commission on the Work of its Nineteenth Session (1967).

------
Chap. 14.-The Agents of International Business

in the absence of agreement, where the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the host State is situated, and there may be more
than one seat (Article 17). (d) Only such freedom of movement
and travel is allowed as is necessary for the performance of the
functions of the special mission (Article 27; contrast Article 26
of the Vienna Convention). (e) An action for damages arising
out of an accident caused by a vehicle used outside the official
functions of the person sought to be sued is not within the scope
of immunity from the civil and administrative jurisdiction of the
host State (Article 31 paragraph 2 (d)). (f) Immunities are
allowable to a mission representative in transit through a
third State only if that State has been informed beforehand of
the proposed transit, and has raised no objection (Article 42
paragraph 4).
4.-OTHER CATEGORIES OF REPRESENTATIVES
AND AGENTS
Representatives and Observers Accredited in Relation to Inter-
national Organisations
The increasing establishment of permanent missions and
delegations accredited in relation to international organisations
prompted the United Nations General Assembly in 1958 to
invite the International Law Commission to consider the subject
of the relations between States and inter-governmental inter-
national organisations. As a result of the Commission's
labours at its sessions in 1968, 1969, 1970, and 19711 a com-
posite set of draft articles was prepared dealing with the
conduct and treatment of:---

(a) permanent missions to inter-
national organisation; (b) permanent observer missions of non-
member Governments to international organisations; and

(c) delegations to organs of international organisations, and to
conferences of States convened by or under the auspices of
international organisations. These draft articles encompass
mutatis mutandis much the same matters as dealt with by the
1 For text of the principal draft articles and commentary thereon, _see_ the
Reports of the Commission on the Work of its Twentieth (1968), Twenty-first
(1969), and Twenty-second (1970) Sessions.

Part 4.-International Transactions
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 and the
Convention on Special Missions of 1969, and represent a
substantial contribution to the whole corpus of diplomatic law,
while serving to stabilise the practice as to these new classes of
representatives and delegates. However, the contrary position
of representatives of international organisations accredited to
States was not dealt with, mainly because these representatives
would of necessity be officials of the organisation concerned,
and therefore their status would normally be covered by the
appropriate rules and regulations of the organisation. More-
over, the draft articles do not purport to regulate the position of
representatives or observers accredited to regional organisations
or organs of, or conferences convened by these regional bodies;
only general or universal international organisations are within
the scope of the articles.
As was to be expected, the drafts are in numerous places
based upon provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations of 1961. Where, as a practical matter, the Vienna
Convention cannot have application, the Convention has not
been copied; for example, the rule has been adopted that States
parties may freely appoint the members of missions or delega-
tions (_see_ draft Articles 10, 55, and 84).
Non-diplomatic Agents and Representatives
States may employ for various purposes agents, other than
regularly accredited diplomatic envoys or consuls. These may
be of a permanent character, such as Trade Commissionersland
officers of independent information or tourist services. No
special rules of international law have developed with respect to
such agents. Their rights and privileges may be the subject of
specific bilateral arrangement, or simply a matter of courtesy.
Normally, they may expect to be treated with consideration by
receiving States.
Independent representatives unlike the commercial counsellors or com-
mercial attachés of permanent diplomatic missions.
