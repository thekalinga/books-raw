RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF STATES
CHAPTER 8
JURISDICTION
1.-GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
THE practice as to the exercise by States of jurisdiction over
persons, property, or acts or events varies for each State,
and these variations are due to historical and geographical
factors which are likely to play a less important role in the
future when countries become more knit together. For
example, the Anglo-American group of States pay allegiance
preponderantly to the territorial principle of jurisdiction,
according to which each State may exercise jurisdiction over
property and persons in, or acts occurring within, its territory.1
This preferential attachment to the territorial theory springs
from the circumstance that in the territories under Anglo-
American dominion sea frontiers predominate, and the free
or unrestricted movement of individuals or of property to or
from other countries did not in the past occur so readily or
frequently as between States bounded for the most part by
land frontiers. On the other hand, the European States take
a much broader view of the extent of their jurisdiction precisely
because the Continent is a network of land or river frontiers,
and acts or transactions of an international character have
been more frequent owing to the rapidity and facility of
movement across the frontiers between these countries.
Historically, it was not often that Anglo-American Courts
were called upon to exercise jurisdiction wider than the
territorial jurisdiction, but with the increasing speed of modern
communications this is not likely to remain a permanent
condition.
1 For affirmation of this principle, _see_ Board of Trade v. Owen, (1957] A.C.

Chap. 8.-Jurisdiction
243
International law sets little or no limitation on the jurisdiction
which a particular State may arrogate to itself. It would
appear to follow from the much discussed _Lotus Case_ (1927),
decided by the Permanent Court of International Justice, that
there is no restricticn on the exercise of jurisdiction by any State
unless that restriction can be shown by the most conclusive
evidence to exist as a principle of international law. In that
case the Permanent Court did not accept the French thesis
France being one of the parties---that a claim to jurisdiction
by a State must be shown to be justified by international law
and practice. In the Court's opinion, the onus lay on the
State claiming that such exercise of jurisdiction was unjustified,
to show that it was prohibited by international law.
There is one practical limitation on the exercise of wide
jurisdiction by a particular State. To quote a distinguished
Judge, 2 " no State attempts to exercise a jurisdiction over
matters, persons or things with which it has absolutely no
concern". As, generally,
As, generally, persons or things actually in the
territory of a State and under its sovereignty must affect
that State, it will be found that the territorial basis of juris-
diction is the normal working rule.
2.- TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION
The exercise of jurisdiction by a State over property, persons,
acts or events occurring within its territory is clearly conceded
by international law to all members of the society of States.
The principle has been well put by Lord Macmillan?:---

" It is an essential attribute of the sovereignty of this realm,
as of all sovereign independent States, that it should possess
jurisdiction over all persons and things within its territorial
limits and in all causes civil and criminal arising within these
limits ".
According to the British practice, the mere physical presence
of any person or thing within the territory is sufficient to
attract jurisdiction without the necessity for either domicile

or residence. Indeed, under the so-called principle of " tran-
sient jurisdiction ", a British Court may exercise jurisdiction
in regard to a person, based on the service of proceedings on
him during a mere fleeting visit to British territory. Further-
more, the legislature is presumed to intend that its legislation
shall be restricted in its application to persons, property and
events in the territory over which it has territorial jurisdiction,
unless a contrary intention appears, and statutes are construed
with reference to this presumed intention. A similar rule of
construction is applied in the United States. 4
For the purposes of territorial jurisdiction, besides actual
territory, it has been customary to assimilate the following to
State territory :---


(a) The territorial sea.

(b) A ship bearing the national flag of the State wishing
to exercise jurisdiction.

(C) Ports.

(a) The territorial sea.-As mentioned in the preceding
chapter, vessels of non-littoral States have a right of innocent
passage through the waters of the territorial sea, or maritime
belt, but there is no right of innocent overflight for aircraft.
There was formerly some doubt whether foreign vessels which
were merely in transit through the territorial sea were subject
for all purposes to the jurisdiction of the littoral State. In R.
v. Keyn (The Franconia)" it was held that an English Criminal
Court had in the absence of a Statute no jurisdiction over a
crime committed by a foreigner on a foreign vessel less than
three miles from the coast. This decision astounded many
English legal authorities, and was nullified by the enactment

Protocol of October 15, 1966 to the Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters of
April 26, 1966 (Hague Conference on Private International Law), a judgment
based on the exercise of such jurisdiction is not to be recognised or enforced
by the Courts of another State if the defendant so requests.

Chap. 8.-Jurisdiction
245
of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act, 1878, giving the
Courts jurisdiction over offences committed within the maritime
belt, which was defined as three miles from the shore.
According to the Act, however, a foreigner was only to be
prosecuted by leave of the Secretary of State.
The subject of arrests and criminal investigations on board
foreign merchant vessels passing through the territorial sea,
and of civil process against such vessels, is dealt with as part of
the right of innocent passage in Articles 19--22 of the Conven-
tion on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone, signed at
Geneva on April 28, 1958. These provisions impose limita-
tions on the jurisdictional rights of the coastal State, in the
interests of minimising interference with shipping in transit.
In connection with crimes committed on board a foreign
merchant vessel during its passage through the territorial sea,
Article 19 provides that the coastal State may not arrest any
person or conduct any investigation, except in the following
cases :---

(a) if the consequences of the crime extend to the
coastal State; or (b) if the crime is of a kind to disturb the peace
of the country or the good order of the territorial sea; or (c) if
the assistance of the local authorities has been requested by
the captain of the ship or by the consul of the country whose
flag the ship flies; or (d) if it is necessary for the suppression of
illicit traffic in narcotic drugs. These limitations do not apply
to the right of the coastal State to take any steps authorised by
its laws for the purpose of an arrest or investigation on board
a ship passing through the territorial sea after leaving internal
waters. With regard to crimes committed before the vessel
entered the territorial sea, if the ship, proceeding from a foreign
port, is only passing through the territorial sea without entering
internal waters, the coastal State may not take any steps on
board the vessel to arrest any person or conduct any investiga-
tion. Article 19 applies also to Government vessels, whether
operated for commercial or non-commercial purposes (_see_
Articles 21 and 22).
Civil process is dealt with in Article 20. First, the coastal
State is not to stop or divert a foreign merchant ship passing
through the territorial sea for the purpose of exercising civil

------
246
Part 3.-Rights, etc., of States
jurisdiction in relation to a person on board the ship. Second,
the coastal State may not levy execution against or arrest such
a vessel for the purpose of any civil proceedings, except only in
respect of obligations or liabilities assumed or incurred by the
ship itself in the course or for the purpose of its voyage through
the coastal waters; but this is without prejudice to the right of
the coastal State, in accordance with its laws, to levy execution
against or to arrest, for the purpose of any civil proceedings, a
foreign merchant ship lying in the territorial sea, or passing
through the territorial sea after leaving internal waters. Article
20 applies also to Government vessels operated for commercial
purposes (_see_ Article 21), but not to Government vessels oper-
ated for non-commercial purposes (_see_ Article 22).

(b) " Floating Island."---A ship bearing the national flag of
a State is for purposes of jurisdiction treated as if it were
territory of that State, on the principle that it is virtually a
floating island". This rule applies whether the flag-ship
is on the high seas or within foreign territorial waters. It
applies particularly to warships and State ships used only on
Government non-commercial service, inasmuch as under
Articles 8 and 9 of the Convention on the High Seas, signed at
Geneva on April 29, 1958, these have complete immunity on
the high seas from the jurisdiction of any State other than the
flag State. The "floating island" metaphor was, however,
criticised in R. v. Gordon-Finlayson, Ex parte An Officer;?
there the Court pointed out that a ship is not part of the territory
of the flag State but jurisdiction may be exercised over the ship
by that State in the same way as over its own territory. A
leading writer4 on international law also severely condemned
_See_ R. v. Anderson (1868), L.R. 1 C.C.R. 161; 11 Cox C.C. 198. The
rule was also applied in the decision of the Permanent Court of International
Justice in _The Lotus_, Pub. P.C.I.J. (1927), Series A, No. 10, and in the decision
of an international arbitral tribunal in The Costa Rica Packet.

  of an extradition treaty, deemed to have been committed in the territory of
  the flag State, which is a party to the treaty; _see_ R. v. Governor of Brixton

the "floating island" theory and the principle of the terri-
toriality of vessels on the high seas. Yet the theory continues
to receive recognition and application."

(c) Ports.-A port is part of internal waters, and therefore is
as fully portion of State territory as the land itself. Neverthe-
less, ships of other States are subject to a special regime in
port which has grown from usage, and varies according to the
practice of the State to which the port belongs.
The general rule is that a merchant vessel enters the port of
a foreign State subject to the local jurisdiction. The deroga-
tions from this rule depend on the practice followed by each
State. There is, however, an important exception which
belongs to the field of customary international law, namely,
that a vessel in distress has a right to seek shelter in a foreign
port, and on account of the circumstances of its entry is
considered immune from local jurisdiction, subject perhaps
to the limitation that no deliberate breaches of local municipal
law are committed while it is in port. On the other hand, some
authorities concede only a qualified immunity to such vessels.
As we shall _see below_," foreign public vessels are subject to
special rules of jurisdiction and their status in port is con-
sidered in connection with these rules.
Where offences or misdemeanours are committed on board
vessels berthed in foreign ports, jurisdiction depends on the
practice followed by the territorial State of the port concerned.
According to the British practice, foreign merchant vessels
in British ports and British merchant vessels in foreign ports
are subject to the complete jurisdiction and police regulations
of the State of the port.3 But in criminal matters, it is not usual
for British authorities to intervene and enforce the local
jurisdiction unless their assistance is invoked by or on behalf
of the local representative-for example, a consul---of the
flag State of the vessel, or those in control of the vessel, or
1 _See_ Article 23 of the Rome Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign
Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface, of October 7, 1952, which provides
that for the purposes of the Convention, a ship or aircraft on the high seas is
to be regarded as part of the territory of the State in which it is registered.

------
248
Part 3.---Rights, etc., of States
unless the peace or good order of the port is likely to be
affected. British practice maintains that in each case it is
for the authorities of the territorial State to judge whether or
not to intervene.
The practice of the United States and of France is somewhat
different from that of Great Britain, a distinction being drawn
between :---

(a) matters of internal discipline or internal economy
of the vessel, over which the authorities of the flag State, includ-
ing consuls, are considered to have primary jurisdiction; and

(b) matters affecting the peace or good order of the port, which
are reserved for the jurisdiction of local Courts and local
authorities. Thus, in Wildenhus' Case, the United States
Supreme Court held that the stabbing and killing of one
Belgian seaman by another on board a Belgian ship in an
American port was subject to local prosecution, and was
excluded from jurisdiction by the Belgian Consul.
The differences between the various State practices are far
more a question of form than of substance, and it would
appear possible by international agreement to bridge these
artificial gaps (_cf._ in this connection the Convention and
Statute of December 9, 1923, on the International Régime of
Maritime Ports).
Technical Extensions of the Territorial Jurisdiction
Apart from the assimilation to territory of the maritime
belt, of ships at sea, and of ports, certain technical extensions
of the principle of territorial jurisdiction became necessary in
order to justify action taken by States in cases where one or
more constituent elements of an act or offence took place
outside their territory. These extensions were occasioned by
the increasing facilities for speedy international communication
and transport, leading to the commission of crimes in one
State which were engineered or prepared in another State.
Some States in whose territory such ancillary acts took place,
declined to prosecute or punish the offenders responsible on
the ground that as the acts were accessory to a principal offence

------
Chap. 8. ---Jurisdiction
249
committed elsewhere, the territorial jurisdiction did not apply."
But several States met the new conditions by technically
extending the territorial jurisdiction :---


(a) Applying the subjective territorial principle, these States
arrogated to themselves a jurisdiction to prosecute and punish
crimes commenced within their territory, but completed or
consummated in the territory of another State. Although
this principle was not so generally adopted by States as to
amount to a general rule of the law of nations, particular
applications of it did become a part of international law as a
result of the provisions of two international Conventions, the
Geneva Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting
Currency (1929), and the Geneva Convention for the Suppres-
sion of the Illicit Drug Traffic (1936).2 Under these Con-
ventions, the States parties bound themselves to punish, if
taking place within their territory, conspiracies to commit and
intentional participation in the commission of counterfeiting
and drug traffic offences wherever the final act of commission
took place, as also attempts to commit and acts preparatory to
the commission of such offences, and in addition agreed to
treat certain specific acts as distinct offences and not to con-
sider them as accessory to principal offences committed else-
where (in which case these specific acts would not have been
punishable by the State in whose territory they took place).

(b) Pursuant to the objective territorial principle, certain
States applied their territorial jurisdiction to offences or acts
commenced in another State, but:---


(i) consummated or com-
pleted within their territory, or (ii) producing harmful con-
sequences to the social order inside their territory. The objective
territorial theory was defined by Professor Hyde as follows:---

" The setting in motion outside of a State of a force which
produces as a direct consequence an injurious effect therein
1 _See_ in this connection, the House of Lords decision in Board of Trade v.
Owen, [1957] A.C. 602; [1957] 1 All E.R. 411, to the effect that a conspiracy
in England to commit a crime abroad is not indictable in England unless the
contemplated crime is one for which an indictment would lie before an English
Court. _See also_ R. v. Cox, [1968] 1 All E.R. 410 (alleged conspiracy to com-
mit fraud in France), and p. 250, n. 1, _post._
2 This Convention has continued to remain in force as between its parties
notwithstanding the penal repression provisions of the Single Narcotic Drugs
Convention of 1961.

------
250
Part 3.-Rights, etc., of States
justifies the territorial sovereign in prosecuting the actor when
he enters its domain ".
Illustrations of the theory were given in an official League of
Nations report concerned with the criminal jurisdiction of
States over offences committed outside their territory;' these
were:---

(a) a man firing a gun across a frontier and killing
another man in a neighbouring State; (b) a man obtaining
money by false pretences by means of a letter posted in Great
Britain to a recipient in Germany.
The objective territorial principle was applied in the pro-
visions of the two international Conventions just referred to,
and has also been recognised in decisions of English, German,
and American Courts. But the most outstanding example of
its application has been the decision of the Permanent Court of
International Justice in 1927 in the _Lotus Case_.3 The facts in
that case were shortly, that a French mail steamer, _The Lotus_,
collided on the high seas with a Turkish collier, due allegedly to
the gross negligence of the officer of the watch on board the
Lotus, with the result that the collier sank and eight Turkish
nationals on board perished. The Turkish authorities insti-
tuted proceedings against the officer of the watch, basing the
claim to jurisdiction on the ground that the act of negligence
on board _The Lotus_ had produced effects on the Turkish
collier, and thus according to the rule mentioned above,4 on
a portion of Turkish territory. By a majority decision, the
Permanent Court held that the action of the Turkish authorities
was not inconsistent with international law.

  States Courts have exercised extra-territorial jurisdiction under anti-trust
  legislation in respect to such arrangements between foreign corporations as
  have or may have monopoly-producing effects or repercussions in the United
  States. In the German Federal Republic, an alien may be rightfully convicted
  of an offence, committed abroad, of disclosing official secrets, if the result of
  such disclosure be to endanger the security of forces stationed in the Republic's

251
Territorial Jurisdiction over Aliens
Territorial jurisdiction is conceded by international law as
much over aliens as over citizens of the territorial State. As
Judge J. B. Moore pointed out in the _Lotus Case_, no presump-
tion of immunity arises from the fact that the person against
whom proceedings are taken is an alien; an alien can claim
no exemption from the exercise of such jurisdiction except so
far as he may be able to show either:---


(i) that he is, by reason
of some special immunity, not subject to the operation of the
local law, or (ii) that the local law is not in conformity with
international law.
Territorial Jurisdiction over Criminals
Great Britain (by long tradition), the United States, and
several other countries, adhere for the most part to a territorial
theory of criminal competence. Indeed, the British theory,
which has been modified as a result of the two international
Conventions mentioned above, goes so far as to deny to States
the right to assume over non-nationals a criminal jurisdiction
which is not properly territorial. But the practice of most
other States departs from an exclusive territorial theory.
The territorial criminal jurisdiction is founded on various
principles. Its normal justification is that, as a matter of
convenience, crimes should be dealt with by the States whose
social order is most closely affected, and in general this will
be the State on whose territory the crimes are committed.2
Important considerations also are that the territorial State has
the strongest interest, the greatest facilities, and the most
powerful instruments for repressing crimes whether committed
by subjects or citizens, or by aliens resident or domiciled within
its territory.3
Although, as we have seen above, the territorial principle
has been extended in several ways, it would appear from the
1 _See above_, p. 249.

Part 3.---Rights, etc., of States
Cutting Case (1887)' that such principle alone does not justify
a State prosecuting a non-national temporarily within its terri-
tory for an alleged offence against its laws, committed abroad on
a prior occasion. The United States Government maintained
this position in its exchanges with the Mexican Government
over this case, which concerned the arrest in Mexico of an
American citizen, Cutting, for having published in Texas an
article alleged to constitute a libel on a Mexican citizen. The
objections formulated by the United States against the applica-
tion of the territorial principle to such a case, have subsequently
been widely supported.
Exemptions from and Restrictions upon the Territorial
Jurisdiction
Certain immunity from the territorial jurisdiction is by
international law, and by municipal law, conferred on:---


(a) Foreign States and Heads of foreign States.

(b) Diplomatic representatives, and consuls of foreign
States.

(c) Public ships of foreign States.

(d) Armed forces of foreign States.

(e) International institutions.
The immunity of these several objects from, at least, the
civil (if not the criminal) jurisdiction is not one of an absolute
character; that is to say, there is no definite prohibition under
international law of a voluntary submission by these objects to
the territorial civil jurisdiction. Hence, if the immunity be
duly waived, the exercise of jurisdiction by the territorial
State becomes permissible.

(a) Foreign States and Heads of Foreign States
The rule is that foreign States and Heads of foreign States
may sue in the territorial Court, but cannot as a rule be sued
there unless they voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of that
Court either ad hoc or generally by a treaty. As pointed out
in Chapter 6, this immunity is dependent on recognition.

Chap. 8.-Jurisdiction

The same principles apply to foreign States as to the Sovereigns
of such States, but it is a curious fact that the rule of immunity
used to be stated-as for example by Marshall, C.J., of the
United States Supreme Court, in 1812, in the classical case of
Schooner Exchange v. M'Faddon"_in. terms which applied
only to foreign Sovereigns. The explanation is that the idea
of the State as a juristic personality, distinct from its Sovereign,
is of recent origin only. Thus, as late as 1867, doubt existed
in England whether a foreign State under a Republican form
of government could sue in English Courts, although this
right had always been conceded to foreign Sovereigns.?
Several principles have been suggested as the basis of this
immunity:---
-


(i) Par in parem non habet imperium. One sovereign power
cannot exercise jurisdiction over another sovereign power, but
only over inferiors.

(ii) Reciprocity or comity.3 In return for a concession of
immunity, other States or Sovereigns of such States make
mutual concessions of immunity within their territory.

(iii) The fact that in general the judgment of a municipal
court cannot be enforced practically against a foreign State or
Sovereign thereof, or that the attempt to do so would be
regarded as an unfriendly act.

(iv) An implication from the circumstances; the very fact
that a State allows a foreign State to function within, or a
foreign Sovereign to visit, its territory, signifies a concession of
immunity, as no foreign State or foreign Sovereign could be
supposed to enter on any other terms. One Judge well
described this as "an implied obligation not to derogate from
a grant".4


(v) The merits of a dispute involving the transactions or

policy of a foreign Government ought not to be canvassed in
the domestic Courts of another country.1
The rule of jurisdictional immunity of foreign States and
foreign Heads of States has two aspects of significance:---


(1) An immunity as to process of the Court. (2) An immunity
with respect to property belonging to the foreign State or
foreign Sovereign. Aspect (1) may best be considered in the
light of the British practice, which is similar in essentials to
that followed by most other States. The English authorities
lay it down that the Courts will not by their process "implead
a foreign State or foreign Sovereign; in other words, they will
not, against its will, make it a party to legal proceedings
whether the proceedings involve process against its personality
or aim to recover from it specific property or damages. In the
Cristina,it was held that a writ in rem for the recovery of
possession of a vessel, requisitioned by a Government, im-
pleaded that Government since it commanded the defendants
to appear or to let judgment go by default, thus imposing a
clear alternative of submitting to jurisdiction or losing posses-
sion of the ship and ancillary rights. The writ and subsequent
proceedings were accordingly set aside.
This aspect of the rule of immunity is so strictly applied
that process even indirectly "impleading" a foreign State or
foreign Sovereign has been treated as to that extent bad. It
was consistent with such strict application that British and
American Courts should hold State-owned commercial ships
to be immune from all territorial process.
As to aspect (2) of the rule of immunity, the Courts apply
the principle that they will not by their process, whether the
foreign State or foreign Sovereign is a party to the proceedings
or not, allow the seizure or detention or judicial disposition of
property which belongs to such State or Sovereign, or of which
it is in possession or control. If the foreign State or foreign
Sovereign has no title to the property alleged to be impleaded,

255
it must at least show rights to possession or control in order to
claim immunity. Aspect (2) was applied in the case mentioned
above, the Cristina, in addition to aspect (1), the House of
Lords ruling that a writ in rem issued in Admiralty against a
vessel in the control of a foreign Government for public
purposes, imported process against the possessory rights of a
foreign Sovereign. As a condition of obtaining immunity, the
foreign Government needs only to produce evidence showing
" that its claim is not merely illusory, nor founded on a title,
manifestly defective."1 It is not bound to give complete proof
of its proprietary or possessory title.
The rule of immunity is not confined to proceedings in rem,
for immunity can be claimed even if the proceedings are
in personam but would if successful have the indirect effect of
depriving the foreign State or foreign Sovereign of proprietary
or possessory rights, or of any rights of control.2
In recent years when foreign States have engaged in a wide
variety of commercial activities, the question has been raised
whether a State has immunity from territorial jurisdiction in
respect of acts relating to its trading affairs. The Courts of
several countries, notably Italy and Belgium, have not refused
to exercise jurisdiction in such cases. And in at least one
American case, 3 it was ruled that a foreign trading corporation
did not enjoy immunity merely because some of its stock was held

agent of a foreign State, with legal title to a local debt, is calculated or intended
to displace such title to the debt, nor could the action proceed against the
debtor Bank holding the moneys in question.

by a foreign State, or because its commercial activities were regar-
ded by the Government of that State as governmental or public.
The immunity of a foreign State or foreign Sovereign from
jurisdiction is not in all cases an absolute one, as sometimes,
depending on the nature of the remedy sought, there is no
exemption from process. 2 Thus the following proceedings
appear to be exceptions to the rule of immunity:---
-


(i) Suits relating to the title to land within the territorial
jurisdiction, not being land on which legation premises are
established. The principle which is applied here is that the
local State has too vital an interest in its land, to permit of any
derogation from its jurisdiction over suits concerned with the
title thereto.

(ii) A fund in Court (a trust fund) is being administered in
which a foreign State or foreign Sovereign is interested, but
not if the alleged trustee happens also to be a foreign sovereign
Government. 3

(iii) Representative actions, such as debenture holders'
actions, where a foreign State or foreign Sovereign is a debenture
holder.

(iv) The winding-up of a company in whose assets the
foreign State or foreign Sovereign claims an interest.
State practice also shows that not all States are ready to
concede a full extent of immunity from jurisdiction. First,
some States apply the distinction mentioned above between
State-like activities of foreign States or Sovereigns (jure imperii)
and their purely commercial activities (jure gestionis), allowing
immunity only in the former instance. Secondly, the muni-
cipal Courts of certain States follow a practice of closely

our Courts in any circumstances

examining the nature and object of each particular transaction,
in respect to which immunity is claimed, to determine whether
or not the transaction really pertains to the functions of the
foreign State. Thirdly, there is no clear practice as regards
the immunity of foreign Governmental agencies or instru-
mentalities, and of foreign semi-public corporations. Some
States are prepared here to follow the municipal law of the
foreign State concerned, other States have regard to circum-
stances other than that municipal law, in order to ascertain
whether the agency or corporation is part of the foreign State.
As to foreign semi-public corporations, in particular if they
are not of the character of departments of State, but simply
separate juridical entities, the privilege of jurisdictional im-
munity does not attach. It would seem from Krajina v. Tass
Agencyl and Baccus S.R.L. v. Servicio Nacional del Trigo2
that it is a question of degree whether separate juridical
incorporation has proceeded so far as to deprive an agency of its
character as a department of State, or whether notwithstanding
its incorporation, it still possesses that character. A separate,
incorporated legal entity may, by the reason of the degree of
governmental control over it, nonetheless be an organ of the State.
A decisive criterion is whether the corporate entity is in
effect the alter ego of a government. 3
The immunity from process covers conduct by the foreign
State or foreign Sovereign which is a breach of local municipal
law. In such case, if the territorial State feels aggrieved by the
breach of its laws, the only course open to it is to seek diplo-
matic redress. The immunity extends also in respect of
personal acts such as a promise of marriage, and even if the
foreign Sovereign is living incognito.4
As mentioned above, the immunity may be waived by express
or implied consent. If the waiver is express, it must be made
with full knowledge of its consequences, and with the full

authority of the sovereign Government in question. What
amounts to an implied waiver depends on all the circumstances
of the case, and the Courts have been extremely reluctant to
infer a waiver of immunity. Thus it has been held that the
following acts did not amount to a submission to jurisdiction:---


(a) A submission to arbitration proceedings preceding action,
or even a subsequent application to set aside these proceedings. 2

(b) Living in the jurisdiction and entering into contracts there.3

(c) Seizure by the agents of a foreign State of a vessel within
the jurisdiction."

(d) A clause in a contract, 5 to which the foreign Sovereign
is party, whereby it is agreed that the Sovereign will submit
to the jurisdiction of the territorial Courts in matters arising
out of the contract.
Nothing short of an undertaking given in face of the Court
at the time when the Court is asked to exercise jurisdiction will
suffice as a submission to jurisdiction.5
In this connection may be considered the matter of set-offs
or counter-claims against a State which has begun suit in the
Courts of the territorial State. The principle is that a foreign
State suing as aforesaid submits itself to the ordinary incidents
of the suit, so that, for instance, a defendant may set up a set-off
or counter-claim arising out of the same matter in dispute, but
not an independent and unrelated cross-claim, the test being
whether the cross-claim is sufficiently connected with or allied
to the subject-matter of the foreign State's claim as to make it
necessary in the interests of justice that it should be disposed of
along with that claim. The justification of this principle is

that if a foreign State or foreign Sovereign chooses voluntarily
to litigate, it must abide by all the rules like any other litigant
and ultimately take all the consequences of its decision to
sue. According to a decision of the United States Supreme
Court, the principle may apply, and immunity be lost even in
the case of an "indirect " counter-claim, that is to say one
arising out of facts or transactions, extrinsic to those on which
the plaintiff State's claim is based. The decisive test is, in
effect, whether there has been on the part of the plaintiff State a
definitive election to submit for all purposes to the Court in
which the suit was instituted. These principles apply mutatis
mutandis to proceedings by diplomatic representatives and con-
suls (_see below_; and _cf._ also Article 32 paragraph 3 of the
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of April 18, 1961).

(b) Diplomatic Representatives, and Consuls, of Foreign States
The jurisdictional immunities of diplomatic agents are set
out in Articles 31--32 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations of April 18, 1961. They enjoy absolute immunity
from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State, and
immunity from its civil and administrative jurisdiction except
in three special cases specified in Article 31, namely:---

(a) Actions
for recovery of purely private immovable property. (b) Actions
relating to succession in which they are involved in a purely
private capacity. (c) Actions relating to any private,
professional or commercial activity exercised by them. In
Great Britain, the immunity of diplomatic envoys rests partly on
the common law, embodying the approved rules of custom of
international law, and partly on Statutes, namely, the Diplo-
matic Privileges Act, 1708, the International Organisations
(Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950, the Diplomatic Immuni-
ties (Commonwealth Countries and Republic of Ireland) Act,
National City Bank v. Republic of China (1955), 348 U.S. 356.
. Under Article 29, the person of a diplomatic agent is inviolable, and he is
not liable to any form of arrest or detention.
* A person who acquires diplomatic status after proceedings have been insti-
  tuted against him, becomes entitled to immunity, notwithstanding that he has
  previously taken steps in the action; _see_ Ghosh v. D'Rozario, [1963] 1 Q.B.106;
  (1962] 2 All E.R. 640.

Part 3.-Rights, etc., of States
1952, dealing with the privileges of High Commissioners from
the Commonwealth and of the Ambassador of Ireland, and
their staffs and families, the Diplomatic Immunities Restriction
Act, 1955 (_see below_, p. 263), the Diplomatic Immunities
(Conferences with Commonwealth Countries and Republic of
Ireland) Act, 1961, and now the Diplomatic Privileges Act,
1964. Under the 1708 Act, which has always been regarded
      as merely declaratory of the common law, all writs whereby
      the person of an ambassador might be arrested or his goods
      seized, were null and void. The 1950 Act, replacing prior
      statutory provisions, extended the privileges of immunity from
      diplomatic representatives proper to a wider class, including
      officers of approved international organisations, members of
      organisations or Committees thereof, and persons on special
      missions relating thereto. The 1964 Act was passed to give
      effect to the provisions of the Vienna Convention of 1961,
      _ante_, and thus to enable ratification of the Convention.
      This immunity of diplomatic envoys extends not merely to
      their own persons, but to their suite, and members of their
      family forming part of their household, provided that they are
      not nationals of the receiving State (_see_ Article 37 of the Vienna
      Convention). Usually, the practice in most countries is to
      deposit periodically with the Foreign Office or similar Govern-
      ment Department a list of personnel for whom exemption from
      the territorial jurisdiction is claimed. In this list will be found
      the names of first, second, and third secretaries, counsellors,
      attachés, etc.?
      In Great Britain, statements of the Foreign Office as to the
      1 For the special conditions governing the immunity of administrative and
      technical staff, and members of their families, members of the service staff,
      and private servants of members of the mission, _see_ paragraphs 2--4 of Article
      37 of the Vienna Convention. _See also_ In re C. (An Infant), [1959) Ch. 363;
      [1958] 2 All E.R. 656 (a son of a diplomatic agent, ordinarily resident with
      him, cannot be made a ward of Court without the latter's consent).
      2 The mere possession of a diplomatic passport or visa, without actual
      membership of a diplomatic mission accredited to the territorial or any other
      State, is insufficient to confer immunity; _see_ United States v. Coplon and
      Gubitchev (1950), 88 F. Supp. 915, and U.S. v. Melekh (1960), 190 F. Supp. 67
      (United Nations employee with Soviet diplomatic passport). The publication
      of lists is provided for, in respect of persons covered by the International
      Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950, by Section 2 of that Act.

diplomatic status of a particular person are accepted as con-
clusive by British Courts in the same way as with foreign
States and foreign Sovereigns. This was emphatically laid
down by the House of Lords in the leading case of Engelke
V. Musmann.2
The immunity from jurisdiction is subject to waiver, which
must be express (_see_ Article 32 paragraph 2 of the Vienna
Convention). If the person claiming privilege is of lesser
rank than the head of the legation, the waiver must be made
by or on behalf of the superior envoy or his Government, and
must be made with full knowledge of the circumstances and
of that person's rights; a waiver merely by a solicitor as such
for that person is insufficient.3 British Courts usually insist on
strict proof of waiver.
If the Ambassador or other head of mission waives the privi-
lege of a subordinate diplomatic official, then that privilege
ceases irrespective of the desire of that official to retain his
immunity. 4
A waiver of immunity from jurisdiction does not imply
waiver of immunity in respect of the execution of the judgment,
for which a separate waiver is necessary (_see_ Article 32 para-
graph 4 of the Vienna Convention).
When the mission terminates, immunity continues for a
reasonable time to enable the envoy to leave the receiving coun-
try, and in any event, as to acts performed by him in the
exercise of his functions (_see_ Article 39 paragraph 2 of the
Vienna Convention). This extension of the period of immunity
does not apply to a diplomatic agent who has been dismissed,
and whose immunity has been waived by the Ambassador or
head of the mission.5
The principle on which the jurisdictional immunity of a
diplomatic envoy is based is that he should be free to perform
official business on behalf of his country, without disturbance,

interference, or interruption. This principle applies so as to
cast a shield of inviolability over the legation premises (unless
used for subversive purposes), all property held for the better
fulfilment of the envoy's mission, and means of transport (_see_
Article 22 of the Vienna Convention).
It seems that if a diplomatic agent engages in espionage
against the State to which he is accredited, that State is not
bound to respect his jurisdictional immunity.?
If a diplomatic envoy passes through or is in the territory of
a third State which has granted him a passport visa, if such visa
was necessary, while proceeding to take up or to return to his
post, or when returning to his own country, the third State
must accord him inviolability and such other immunities as
may be required to ensure his transit or return (Article 40
paragraph 1 of the Vienna Convention).
Immunity from jurisdiction should not be confused with
immunity from liability, for once the exemption from juris-
diction is effectively waived, liability may arise. The comments
of Lord Hewart, C.J., in the case of Dickinson v. Del Solar3
are in point:
Diplomatic agents are not, in virtue of their privileges
as such immune from legal liability for any wrongful act. The
accurate statement is that they are not liable to be sued in the
English Courts unless they submit to the jurisdiction. Diplo-
matic privilege does not import immunity from legal liability,
but only exemption from local jurisdiction".
The new international organisations established during and
immediately after the Second World War brought into being
a class of international officials, such as the members of the
Secretariat of the United Nations Organisation, and of delegates
to meetings of international organs, whose duties and functions
clearly required immunity from local jurisdiction of a similar

functional conception of immunity of diplomatic envoys.

the arrest of a diplomatic agent is a moot question. On the alleged
Soviet " harassment of foreign diplomats, _see_ United States Department of
State Bulletin (1952), Vol. 27, pp. 786--8.

kind to that enjoyed by diplomatic representatives of foreign
States.
Accordingly, legislation was enacted both in the United
States and in Great Britain to extend immunity to these persons,
as well as to the international organisations of which they
were members. In Great Britain, this was effected by the
above-mentioned International Organisations (Immunities and
Privileges) Act, 1950,2 replacing earlier enactments, and the
various Orders-in-Council pursuant to the Act, while in the
United States there was passed the Federal International
Organisations Immunities Act of 1945. The detailed provisions
of the two Acts lie beyond the scope of this book, but in
general it can be said that their effect is not as wide as is
suggested by their titles. A limited but reasonably liberal
immunity is conferred on international officials and delegates
to international organs, which may, as in the case of diplomatic
representatives, be waived by higher authority.3 The extent of
the immunity, where it exists, varies with the grade or category
to which the particular official or delegate belongs. Thus, as
with diplomatic envoys, the immunity is one not from legal
liability but from jurisdiction.
Finally, it should be emphasised that the immunity of
diplomatic envoys is applicable in respect of acts in their
private, as well as in their official capacity. Such immunity for
private acts has not been conceded to all classes of international
officials under the new British and American legislation just
referred to. In this connection, there has been a novel enact-
ment in Great Britain, the Diplomatic Immunities Restriction
Act, 1955, providing for the withdrawal by Order-in-Council of
the immunity for private acts of foreign diplomatic envoys,
their servants and staff, where British envoys are not accorded
the same degree of immunity for private acts by the accrediting
foreign States concerned.
1 _See also_ Chapter 19 below, pp. 582--585
? Other examples of enactments of this kind are the European Coal and Steel
Community Act, 1955,
and the German Conventions Act, 1955.
3 _Cf._ The Ranollo Case (1946), 67 N.Y.S. (2d) 31, where the Secretary-
General of the United Nations did not press the immunity of his chauffeur.

Part 3.-Rights, etc., of States
Consuls
Consuls are not diplomatic agents, and in respect of private
acts, are not immune from local jurisdiction, except where this
has been specially granted by treaty. But apart from treaty
provisions, as to official acts within the limits of consular
powers under international law, they are exempt from the
jurisdiction of judicial or administrative authorities of the
receiving State, unless the immunity is waived by the sending
State. The rules applicable to the waiver of the immunity of
diplomatic envoys apply mutatis mutandis. The justification
of this limited consular immunity is that the consul is received
by the country where he resides as an officer of a foreign State
charged with the performance of consular duties, and to carry
out these duties properly he obviously requires immunity from
local process.
Consuls who are at the same time diplomatic representatives
of their States, are entitled to general immunity even in respect
of private matters.2
The subject of consular immunities is now dealt with in
detail in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, signed
on April 24, 1963 (referred to, pp. 390--391, 393, _post._).

(c) Public Ships of Foreign States
Men-of-war and public vessels of foreign States, while in
the ports or internal waters of another State, are in a great
measure exempt from the territorial jurisdiction. For this
purpose, a private vessel chartered by a State for public
purposes, for example, the transport of troops, transport of
war materials, is a public vessel. Proof of character as
men-of-war or as public vessels is supplied by the ship's flag
_See_ Waltier v. Thomson (1960), 189 F. Supp. 319 (consular immigration
officer immune from suit for allegedly false representations concerning pros-
pects for immigrants).

Digest of Public International Law Cases, 1931--1932, p. 328. A consul who
later acquires diplomatic status is immune from process as to acts outside the
scope of his duties, committed while he was consul, so long as he retains his
new status; _see_ Arcaya v. Paez (1956), 145 F. Supp. 464.

in conjunction with the ship's documents, for example, the
commission issued and signed by the authorities of the State
to which she belongs.
There are two theories as to jurisdiction in the case of public
ships of a foreign State:---

(a) The "floating island" theory
according to which a public ship is to be treated by other
States as part of the territory of the State to which she belongs.
By this theory, the jurisdiction of the territorial Court is
excluded for all purposes where any act is done, or offending
party found on board the ship. (b) The territorial Court
accords to the ship and its crew and contents certain immunities
depending not on an objective theory that the public ship is
foreign territory, but on an implication of exemption granted
by the local territorial law. These immunities conceded by
local law are conditional and can in turn be waived by the
State to which the public ship belongs.
In Chung Chi Cheung v. R.,' a case of a crime committed on
board a Chinese public vessel in the territorial waters of Hong
Kong, that is, British territory, the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council rejected the former and approved the latter
theory. On the particular facts of the case, it held that the
Chinese Government had waived immunity, and that the
Hong Kong Court had jurisdiction. It pointed out that
theory (b) alone was consistent with the paramount necessity
for each nation to protect itself from internal disorder by trying
and punishing offenders within its boundaries. In support of
its views, it cited the classical judgment of Marshall, C.J., of
the United States Supreme Court, in Schooner Exchange v.
M'Faddon, where the immunity of public vessels was based on
an" implied licence " to enter a port, the licence containing an
exemption from the jurisdiction of the State which granted the
rights of hospitality.
Where a public vessel is in port, no legal proceedings will
lie against it, either in rem for recovery of possession, or for
damages for collision or in respect of members of its crew.
But the jurisdictional immunity extends only so far as necessary
(1939) A C. 160.
2 (1812), 7 Cranch 116.
1

------
266
Part 3.-Rights, etc., of States
to enable such public vessel to function efficiently as an organ
of the State and for State purposes.
"The foreign Sovereign could not be supposed to send his
vessel abroad if its internal affairs were to be interfered with,
and members of the crew withdrawn from its service, by local
jurisdiction ".1
Therefore such vessel is bound to observe the ordinary laws
of the port such as quarantine and sanitary regulations, and
not to assist in breaches of local revenue laws. Any failure
to respect these laws and regulations would be a ground for
diplomatic representations, and possibly for expulsion.
Crimes committed on board the vessel while in port, except
against a local subject, remain within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the authorities of the vessel's flag State, including the
commander of the vessel itself. Furthermore, some authorities
maintain that individuals who do not belong to the crew, and
who, after committing a crime on shore, board the vessel in
order to take refuge, cannot be arrested by the local authorities
and removed from the vessel if consent to this course is refused
by the commander of the ship. Where such consent is refused,
the local authorities have their remedy through the diplomatic
channel against the Government of the flag State. On the
other hand, several authorities have expressed the view that
such fugitive criminal should be given up to the local police.
Possibly, asylum may be granted on grounds of humanity, in
cases of extreme danger to the individual seeking it. If
members of the crew break the local laws while ashore, they
are not protected, although normally the local police would
hand them over to the ship's authorities for punishment or
other action, but if the breaches were committed ashore while
on duty, or in the course of official duties, the members of the
crew concerned would, it appears, enjoy complete immunity
from local jurisdiction.3

State-Owned Commercial Ships
For some time, foreign Governments have embarked in
trade with ordinary ships, and have been competing with
shippers and ship-owners in the world's markets. The question
has therefore arisen whether the ordinary principles as to
immunity of public vessels should apply to such ships. The
argument for the affirmative has been based on the Government
ownership of these vessels, and on the risk of " impleading"
a foreign State when exercising jurisdiction in respect of the
ship. It has also been put that the" maintenance and advance-
ment of the economic welfare of a people in time of peace
is no less a public purpose than the maintenance and training
of a naval force. 1
On the other hand, severe criticism has been levelled at this
modern development of the immunity of public vessels. The
objections to the concession of immunity are two principally:---


(1) The doctrine of the immunity of the property of foreign
Sovereigns is a concession to the dignity, equality, and inde-
pendence of foreign sovereign Powers and arises by virtue of
the comity of nations. But it is not consistent with the dignity
of sovereign States that they should enter the competitive
markets of foreign commerce, and ratione cessante, the privilege
of immunity should be withheld. (2) There is injustice to
nationals of the territorial State when a foreign Government
may sue these nationals for matters arising out of its commerce
while at the same time enjoying absolute immunity should
actions in rem or in personam be brought against it. It has
been said in answer to these objections that the remedy to a
person injured is by diplomatic representations through his
Government. Lord Maugham's observations on the uncertain
value of diplomatic redress form a trenchant commentary on
this argumenta:
"In these days and in the present state of the world, diplo-
matic representations made to a good many States afford a
very uncertain remedy to the unfortunate persons who may have
been injured by the foreign government ".

Part 3.-Rights, etc., of States
The position at present is that certain English and American
decisions support the doctrine of immunity of State-owned
trading vessels, but there have been a number of judicial
utterances distinctly unfavourable to the immunity of public
vessels in commercial service. It will be recalled also that
under Articles 20 and 21 of the Convention on the Territorial
Sea and Contiguous Zone of April 28, 1958, public vessels
operated for commercial purposes are not exempt from civil
process in rem if they are lying in the territorial sea, or passing
through the territorial sea after leaving internal waters. 3
There is besides the fact that a number of countries refuse to
concede such immunity, or are parties to the Brussels Conven-
tion of 1926, mentioned in the following paragraph.
After the First World War, a number of international
conferences discussed the subject of jurisdiction over com-
mercial ships owned by foreign Governments. There was an
almost unanimous opinion that the same legal remedies and
actions should apply as in the case of any other ship-owner.
In April, 1926, a large number of States, including Great
Britain, signed at Brussels an International Convention for
the Unification of Certain Rules concerning the Immunities of
Government Vessels. This Convention came into force in
1937, but has been ratified or acceded to by only a small
number of States. Its general effect was that ships and cargoes
owned or operated by States were, in respect of claims relating

in Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman (1945), 324 U.S. 30, the United States
Supreme Court refused to allow immunity to a vessel owned by a foreign
Government but not in its possession and service, where the Department of
State did not expressly recognise that vessel's immunity.

to the operation of the ships or the carriage of cargoes,
to be subject to the same rules of liability as privately-
owned vessels. From these provisions, there were excepted
ships of war, or Government patrol vessels, hospital ships,
and ships used exclusively on governmental and non-com-
mercial service although even in regard to these, certain claims
(for example, of salvage) were permissible. The International
Law Commission has favoured the rules laid down in this
Convention

(d) Foreign Armed Forces
Armed forces admitted on foreign territory enjoy a limited,
but not an absolute, immunity from the territorial jurisdiction.
The extent of the immunity depends upon the circumstances
in which the forces were admitted by the territorial Sovereign,
and in particular upon the absence or presence of any express
agreement between the host and the sending State regulating
the terms and conditions governing the entry of the forces in
the territory
In the absence of such an express agreement, the bare fact
of admission of the forces produces certain generally recognised
consequences of international law. The principle here applying
was stated in classical terms by Marshall, C.J., of the United
States Supreme Court in Schooner Exchange v. M'Faddon' and
were condensed by a very learned Judge2 into the following
general doctrine:---

"A State which admits to its territory an armed force of a
friendly foreign Power impliedly undertakes not to exercise
any jurisdiction over the force collectively or its members
individually which would be inconsistent with its continuing
to exist as an efficient force available for the service of its
sovereign."
In other words, the principle is that the territorial or host
State impliedly undertakes not to exercise any jurisdiction

to the passage of troops through foreign territory, and not to their sojourn.

Part 3.-Rights, etc., of States
over members of the visiting force in such a way as to impair
the integrity and efficiency of the force.
Applying this principle, it follows that by implied grant or
licence from the territorial State:---

(1) The commander of the
visiting force, and the Courts of such force, have exclusive
jurisdiction over offences committed by the members within
the area in which the force is stationed, or in relation to matters
of discipline, or over offences committed outside the stationing
area, but while the members concerned were actually on duty.

(2) The visiting force and its members are immune from the
local jurisdiction, whether civil or criminal, in regard to
matters of internal administration of the force, or necessarily
involved in the performance by such force of its duties (for
example, the bearing of arms, use of motor transport, etc.).
On the other hand, if the members of the force commit offences
outside their area and while engaged on non-military duties,
for example, recreation or pleasure, the territorial State may
claim that they are subject to local law.
It follows further from the above principle that there is no
complete waiver of jurisdiction by the territorial State when
granting a licence or permission to an armed force to enter
its territory; as one learned Judge? has put it, "the extent
of the licence does not correspond with the extent of the
waiver".
Normally, the authorities or Courts of the visiting force
will, at least in matters of discipline or internal adıninistration,
be immune from the supervisory jurisdiction of the local
Courts by the exercise of the prerogative writs (for example,
habeas corpus), unless perhaps there has been a clear case of
exceeding their competence, such as a sentence passed upon a
person who was not a member of the armed force. 3
1 Also, although normally entitled to exercise jurisdiction, the receiving
State may, on the grounds of comity or courtesy, allow the authorities of the
visiting force to deal with the alleged offenders; _cf._ advice of Professor
Yokota in connection with the arrest and prosecution of British naval ratings
in Japan for robbery, London " Times " October 9, 1952.

Chap. 8.---Jurisdiction
271
It is clear that opinions may differ as to how far immunity
should be conceded to foreign visiting forces in order that
military efficiency should be preserved. United States judicial
pronouncements and practice generally favour absolute
immunity for this purpose; not so the British practice.
Differences of opinion have indeed arisen with reference to the
exercise of civil jurisdiction over members of a visiting force.
In the case of Wright v. Cantrella an Australian Court held as
regards American forces on Australian territory for the purpose
of the Pacific War, that the existence or efficiency of those
forces would not be imperilled if an individual member were
subject to a civil suit in the territorial Courts for an injury
caused to a local citizen even in the course of that member's
duties.
The above principles apply if there is no express agreement
between the State admitting and State sending the armed
forces. If, however, there is such an agreement, then _semble_
its terms will govern the jurisdiction of the Courts; for example,
if the admitting State agrees that the visiting forces shall be
exempt from local jurisdiction in all civil and criminal matters,
the Courts are bound by the exemption so conceded. 3
The exemption from jurisdiction is conceded only to visiting
armed forces, and not to a visiting band of men without armed
organisation and unconnected with military operations,
although they may take orders from persons of military rank;
nor is it to be conceded if the members of the visiting band
mix freely with the local inhabitants and are not a body subject
to proper military discipline and organisation. 4
During the Second World War, Great Britain and other
countries in the British Commonwealth enacted legislation
conferring on certain (but not all) Allied forces within their
territories, notably the United States forces, complete jurisdic-
tion over the respective members of these forces and a corre-

lative exemption from local criminal jurisdiction except where
the visiting force waived its exclusive right of jurisdiction.1
In the post-war period, States have had to meet the impact
of an important new development, the stationing of troops and
of accessory civilian or depot personnel in foreign territory in
pursuance of regional security arrangements such as the North
Atlantic Security Pact of April, 1949, or of international forces,
including peacekeeping forces, under the United Nations
Charter. A solution in this connection was adopted by the
North Atlantic Powers in an Agreement signed in London on
June 19, 1951, relative to the status of the forces of such
Powers. This provides that the sending and receiving
States are to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over members of a
visiting force of a North Atlantic Power and civilian component
personnel, subject to:---

(a) exclusive jurisdiction being exercised
by each State respectively in regard to offences which are
punishable only by its laws; (b) the sending State having the
primary right to exercise jurisdiction, in cases of concurrent
jurisdiction, in relation to offences solely against the property
or security of such sending State, or against the person or
property of members of the force or civilian component
personnel, or offences arising out of any act or omission in
performance of official duty, with the receiving State entitled
to the primary right to exercise jurisdiction as to other offences.
As to civil jurisdiction, no claim of immunity is to be pressed
by the sending State except where members of the force act
within the scope of their official duties. Other provisions in
the Agreement enable review and modification of the subject
of jurisdiction in the event of hostilities, and lay down certain
minimum standards to be observed by the Courts of the receiv-
ing State. This has been followed by a number of other

International Law (1957), Vol. 51, pp. 29--62. Somewhat similar principles
have been followed in the stationing of forces agreements concluded by the
Soviet Union; for texts, _see_ American Journal of International Law (1958),
Vol. 52, pp. 210--227. Note also the Tokyo Agreement of February 19, 1954,

status and stationing agreements, coupled with _de facto_
practices and arrangements, sometimes not governed by any
defined guidelines or sometimes not the subject of any uniform
or consistent application.
The ultimate effect however may be to cut down the general
principle that the sending State has exclusive jurisdiction over
offences by servicemen within the limits of their quarters, or
while on duty.1

(e) International Institutions
International institutions such as the United Nations and
the International Labour Organisation have been conceded
immunity from the territorial jurisdiction both under inter-
national agreements (_see_ the Conventions on the Privileges and
Immunities of the United Nations and of the "Specialised
Agencies" adopted by the United Nations General Assembly
in 1946 and 1947) and under municipal law (_see_, for example,
the British International Organisations (Immunities and
Privileges) Act, 1950, and the United States Federal Inter-
national Organisations Immunities Act of 1945).2
The subject of their general privileges and immunities is
dealt with in Chapter 19, below.
3.- PERSONAL JURISDICTION
Personal, as distinct from territorial jurisdiction, depends on
some quality attaching to the person involved in a particular
legal situation which justifies a State or States in exercising
jurisdiction in regard to him. Practically, the jurisdiction is
only employed when the person concerned comes within the
power of the State, and process can be brought against him.
This will occur generally when such person enters the territory
of the State either voluntarily or as a result of successful
extradition proceedings.
1 Nevertheless, the trend in the case of United Nations peacekeeping forces,
of an international composition, is towards absolute immunity from the
jurisdiction of the receiving State.
2 Note also the various Headquarters Agreements concluded by the United
Nations and the specialised agencies, referred to below, pp. 584--585.

------
274
Part 3.--Rights, etc., of States
According to present international practice, personal juris-
diction may be exercised on the basis of one or other of the
following principles :---


(a) Active nationality principle.---Under this principle, juris-
diction is assumed by the State of which the person, against
whom proceedings are taken, is a national. The active
nationality principle is generally conceded by international
law to all States desiring to apply it. There is indeed a
correlative principle of the law of extradition that no State
is bound to extradite from its territory a national guilty of an
offence committed abroad.

(b) Passive nationality principle.---Jurisdiction is assumed by
the State of which the person suffering injury or a civil damage
is a national. International law recognises the passive
nationality principle only subject to certain qualifications.
Thus it would appear from the Cutting Casel that a State
which does not admit the passive nationality principle is not
bound to acquiesce in proceedings on this basis brought
against one of its nationals by another State. The justification,
if any, for exercising jurisdiction on this principle is that
each State has a perfect right to protect its citizens abroad,
and if the territorial State of the locus delicti neglects or is
unable to punish the persons causing the injury, the State of
which the victim is a national is entitled to do so if the persons
responsible come within its power. But as against this, it
may be urged that the general interests of a State are scarcely
attacked "merely because one of its nationals has been the
victim of an offence in a foreign country".2 The passive
nationality principle is embodied in several national criminal
codes, in particular the codes of Mexico, Brazil, and Italy.
Great Britain and the United States, however, have never
admitted the propriety of the principle.

Chap. 8.---Jurisdiction
275
In the _Lotus Case_, Judge J. B. Moore, an American
Judge on the Permanent Court of International Justice,
declared that an article of the Turkish Penal Code whereby
jurisdiction was asserted over aliens committing offences
abroad " to the prejudice " of a Turkish subject was contrary
to international law, but it is not clear to what extent other
members of the Court shared or differed from this view.
4.-JURISDICTION ACCORDING TO THE PROTECTIVE PRINCIPLE
International law recognises that each State may exercise
jurisdiction over crimes against its security and integrity or its
vital economic interests. Most criminal codes contain rules
embodying in the national idiom the substance of this principle,
which is generally known as the protective principle.
In Joyce v. Director of Public Prosecutions, the House of
Lords seems to have held that the English common law
recognises a principle of jurisdiction akin to the protective
principle, namely that an alien owing some kind of allegiance
to the Crown may be tried by British Courts for the crime of
treason committed abroad. Underlying the House of Lords
decision is the consideration that such a crime is one directly
against the security and integrity of the realm, and its reasoning
is applicable to other statutory offences of similar scope (for
example, against the Official Secrets Acts).
The rational grounds for the exercise of this jurisdiction are
two-fold:---


(i) the offences subject to the application of the
protective principle are such that their consequences may be of
the utmost gravity and concern to the State against which they
are directed; (ii) unless the jurisdiction were exercised, many

72 F. Supp. 230. Also in U.S. v. Rodriquez (1960), 182 F. Supp. 479, the
protective principle was used to justify the prosecution of aliens for false
statements in immigration applications, and in Rocha v. U.S. (1961), 288 F. (20)
545, the prosecution of defendants for being engaged in a " war brides racket",
i.e. conspiracy abroad to arrange sham marriages between aliens and American
citizens, so as to gain a preferential immigration status, thereby evading
American immigration laws. _See also_ Stegeman v. United States (1970),
425 F. (2d) 984 (jurisdiction held to be exerciseable in respect to debtors
guilty of fraudulent concealment of assets abroad, in breach of the Federal
Bankruptcy Act of the United States, upon the ground that the Act was
designed to serve important interests of government, related to national
commerce and credit).
2

Part 3.-Rights, etc., of States
such offences would escape punishment altogether because
they did not contravene the law of the place where they were
committed (lex loci delicti) or because extradition would be
refused by reason of the political character of the offence.1
The serious objection to the protective principle is that each
State presumes to be its own judge as to what endangers its
security or its financial credit. Thus in many cases, the
application of the protective principle tends to be quite
arbitrary.
5.---JURISDICTION ON THE HIGH Seas
The rules of international law concerning the high seas or
open sea were codified, and to some degree extended in the
Convention on the High Seas, signed at Geneva on April 29,
1958, and drawn up by the first Conference on the Law of
the Sea.2
The high seas or open sea received definition in Article 1 of the
Convention as all parts of the sea that are not included in the
territorial sea or in the internal waters of a State.
The doctrine of the " freedom of the high seas" (or "free-
dom of the open sea ") is explained in Article 2, and the circum-
stances in which the doctrine became established, may briefly
be mentioned. Historically, navigation on the high seas was
at first open to everybody, but in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries---the periods of great maritime discovery---claims
were laid by the powerful maritime States to the exercise of
sovereignty, indistinguishable from ownership, over specific
portions of the open sea. For example, Portugal claimed
maritime sovereignty over the whole of the Indian Ocean and
a very great proportion of the Atlantic, Spain arrogated rights
to herself over the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico, and even
Great Britain laid claim to the Narrow Seas, and the North Sea.
1 The principle of non-extradition for political crimes is now securely
established; _see below_, pp. 351--352.
2 This Convention was based on Draft Articles prepared by the International
Law Commission. Under Article 35, after the expiration of a period of five
years from the entry into force of the Convention, a request for revision of the
Convention may be made by any party, and the United Nations General
Assembly may decide upon the steps, if any, to be taken in respect of such
request.
* _See also above_, pp. 213--215.

------
Chap. 8. ---Jurisdiction
277
Grotius was one of the first strenuously to attack these
extensive claims to sovereignty. His objections were based
on two grounds :---

(1) The ocean cannot be property of a
State because no State can effectively take it into possession
by occupation. (2) Nature does not give a right to anybody
to appropriate things that may be used by everybody and are
inexhaustible---in other words, the open sea is a res gentium
or res extra commercium.
In opposition to the principle of maritime sovereignty, the
principle of the freedom of the open sea began to develop, as
Hall has pointed out, in accordance with the mutual and
obvious interests of the maritime nations. It was seen that
too often, and to the great inconvenience of all States, con-
flicting claims were laid to the same parts of the open sea.
Furthermore, it came to be realised that any claims to maritime
sovereignty were of little practical value except in time of war
when it was useless to assert them without the backing of a
powerful navy. The freedom of the open sea was thus seen to
correspond to the general interests of all States, particularly as
regards freedom of intercourse between nations.
The term, the " freedom of the high seas", as we now know
it, signifies:---
--(a) that the high seas can never be under the
sovereignty of any one particular State; (b) that there is
absolute freedom of navigation on the high seas for vessels of
all nations whether merchantmen or warships; (c) that in
general no State may exercise jurisdiction over ships within
that sea not bearing its flag; (d) that a State may, as a general
rule, exercise jurisdiction over a particular ship only in virtue
of the maritime flag under which that ships sails; (e) that
every State and its citizens are entitled to make use of the high
seas for laying submarine cables and oil pipelines (the so-called
" freedom of immersion "), for the conduct of fisheries, and
for scientific or technical purposes; (f) that there is absolute
freedom of flight above the open sea for all aircraft.2

  access to the sea by land-locked States. _Cf._ the Convention on Transit Trade

As a
These various components of the freedom of the open
sea must now be read subject to the recent developments
concerning the rights of coastal States over the continental
shelf and contiguous submarine areas, considered in the
previous Chapter.1
The " freedom of the open sea " has never warranted a
state of unregulated lawlessness on the high seas, and certain
rules for the exercise of jurisdiction over vessels at sea became
necessary in order to avoid conditions of anarchy.
measure of necessary supervision, the rule was early established
that all vessels, public or private, on the high seas are subject
to the jurisdiction (in general, exclusive) and entitled to the
protection of the State under whose maritime flag they sail.2
From this followed the corollary rules that no ship may sail
under a particular flag without proper authority from the flag
State, nor sail under a flag other than the one it is properly
authorised to raise. Every State, coastal or non-coastal, has
the right to sail ships under its flag (Article 4 of the Convention),
but is under a duty not to allow a vessel wrongfully to sail
under its flag. Moreover, there should be some genuine
link between a vessel and the State which grants the right to
fly its flag (Article 5). Vessels under an unauthorised flag are
liable to capture and confiscation by the State whose flag has
wrongfully been raised, and the warships of any State may call
on suspicious vessels to show their flag.3 If there is reasonable
ground for suspecting that a merchant ship is engaged in piracy
or the slave trade, it may be boarded, and if necessary searched
(Article 22 of the Convention on the High Seas).
1 _See above_, pp. 219--220, and 223--228.
* The nationality of a vessel for " flag" purposes is determined by the
  State of registration; in other words, by the ship's documents. _See_ Article 5
  of the Convention on the High Seas. The principle of a single flag for each
  ship is laid down in Article 6 of the Convention. It is for each State to
  determine under its own law which ship has the right to fly its flag; _see_ Muscat
  Dhows Case (Permanent Court of Arbitration, 1905), U.N. Reports of Inter-
  national Arbitral Awards, Vol. IX, p. 83.
  SA vessel which is not sailing under the identifiable maritime flag of a
  State is not entitled to protection, and may be seized in suspicious circum-
  stances; _see_ Naim Molvan, Owner of Motor Vessel " Asya" v. A.-G. for
  Palestine, (1948) A.C. 351.

Chap. 8.--Jurisdiction
279
For the protection of the interests of maritime States, inter-
national law conceded to such States a right of " hot pursuit
The matter is now dealt with in Article 23 of the Convention
on the High Seas. This right of " hot pursuit" signifies that
if the coastal State has good reason to believe that a foreign
vessel has infringed its laws and regulations while in the
territorial sea, it may be pursued and apprehended even on
the high seas, provided that: (a) such pursuit is commenced
immediately while the vessel or its accessory boats be still
within the internal waters or territorial sea, or within the
contiguous zone, if the supposed offence be in respect of rights
for the protection of which the zone was established; (b) the
pursuit is continuous and uninterrupted;1 (c) a visual or
auditory (not radio) signal to stop has been given from such
distance as to be seen or heard by the fugitive ship, i.e. a mere
sighting is insufficient; (d) the pursuers are warships or military
aircraft or other Government ships or aircraft specially author-
ised to that effect, although the craft making the arrest need
not be actually the one which commenced pursuit. The right
of hot pursuit ceases as soon as the vessel pursued enters the
territorial sea of its own country or of a third State.
Also, the coastal State may exercise jurisdiction over foreign
vessels outside the maritime belt where there is grave suspicion
that such vessels are a source of imminent danger to the
sovereignty or security of that State. This jurisdiction is
permitted solely on the basis of, and as a measure of self-
protection. A currently debatable point in this connection
is whether a coastal State is, upon grounds of self-defence,
entitled in peace-time to arrest a foreign naval vessel in non-
territorial waters for the reason that such vessel was conducting
offshore electronics intelligence operations and other forms of
sophisticated surveillance, as distinct from mere visual observa-
tion. This issue was raised in 1968 in the case of the arrest by a
1 According to the standard work,
Poulantzas, The
Right of Hot Pursuit in
International Law (1969), at p. 43, the two most important elements of a

commencement.

North Korean patrol boat of the American electronics intelli-
gence vessel, the Pueblo, then operating in North Korean
coastal waters. However, a number of facts surrounding the
Pueblo are the subject of dispute.
Other cases of the exercise of jurisdiction on the high seas
are due to certain international Conventions whereby the
States parties conceded to one another rights, in time of peace, ,
of visiting and searching foreign vessels at sea. These rights
were granted for limited purposes only, which are suggested by
the titles of the particular Conventions concerned, for example,
the Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph
Cables, 1884, the General Act of Brussels of 1890 for the Repres-
sion of the African Slave Trade, and the Interim Convention of
February 9, 1957, for the Conservation of North Pacific Fur
Seal Herds. 1
Apart from these instances, there are some Conventions
which cast duties on States to enforce certain rules, e.g., the
Convention of 1954, as amended, for the Prevention of the
Pollution of the Sea by Oil.
Questions of the regime on the high seas boil down usually
to whether or not particular States are bound or entitled to
exercise jurisdiction.?
In time of war, the rights of jurisdiction of belligerent
maritime States on the high seas are considerably extended.
1 For examples of such Conventions and treaties, _see_ Laws and Regulations
on the Regime of the High Seas (United Nations), Vol I (1951), at pp. 179
_et seq._
? A new problem arose in 1964--1965, with the commencement of transmis-
sions by offshore radio stations in the North Sea area, moored or on fixed
installations outside territorial sea limits. A great deal of what was trans-
mitted consisted of" pop songs " and non-classical music, with some religious
broadcasting, while the programmes were interspersed with advertising. It
was officially alleged that such stations were in breach of the municipal laws of
North Sea countries, including telecommunication regulations, Essentially,
the questions of international law involved reduce to whether or not an
adjacent coastal country is entitled to exercise jurisdiction in respect to the
stations, and the persons concerned in manning them. The proposition that
the stations are acting in breach of general international law, as distinct from
regulations in application of international Conventions, cannot really be
sustained, and for this reason, among others, the term pirate" bestowed
upon them is inapt and misleading. Obviously it is not contrary to inter-
national law to listen to their programmes, nor _semble_ is the mere fact that
their transmissions can be received in a country sufficient to invest that country

A belligerent State has a general right of visit and search of
neutral shipping in order to prevent breaches of neutrality
such as the carriage of contraband. As we have seen, rival
parties in a civil war may obtain these powers of search as a
result of the recognition of belligerency, and the consequent
grant of belligerent rights.
The nuclear weapons test ban treaty of 1963, referred to in
Chapter 7,2 applies to nuclear weapons tests above or in the
waters of the high seas.
Finally, all States have become bound by customary rules as
well as by international Conventions to observe certain regula-
tions relative to the safety of navigation at sea, and to ensure,
by legislation or otherwise, that vessels flying their flags shall
act in conformity with these regulations. In collision cases on
the high seas, the practice as to the exercise of jurisdiction by
States has continued to be fluid. Some States claim jurisdiction
where the damaged vessel is under their flag; other States,
where the vessels involved in the collision consent to their juris-
diction; and certain other States, where the ship responsible for
the collision is in one of their ports at the time proceedings are
instituted. In the _Lotus Case_, the Permanent Court of Inter-
with jurisdiction on the basis of the objective territorial principle. If the
vessels are stateless, and the persons concerned, including those through whom
advertising, fuel, etc., are supplied, are not nationals of any of the coastal
countries, the question of whether any such country is entitled in international
law to exercise jurisdiction is obscure. It is true that cogent arguments can
be advanced in favour of the exercise of jurisdiction according to the protective
principle, as it may be said that the security and good order of coastal countries
are detrimentally affected by:---

(a) the disturbance to the regime of allotted
frequencies, caused by offshore broadcasts; (b) the interference with com-
munications related to essential services, e.g., safety of navigation; (c) the
possible interference with communications connected with space exploration,
and space satellites. Under the auspices of the Council of Europe, an Agree-
ment was concluded to deal with the subject, viz., the European Agreement
for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted outside National Territories,
signed at Strasbourg on January 22, 1965, and in the United Kingdom, the
Marine, etc., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967 was enacted to strike down
North Sea or other offshore broadcasts.

Part 3.-Rights, etc., of States
national Justice held, by a majority, that in collision cases on
the high seas there is no rule of international law attributing
exclusive penal jurisdiction to the flag State of a ship involved in
the collision as regards an offence committed on that ship, and
that jurisdiction could be exercised by the flag State of the ship
on which the offence had produced its effects in the course of the
collision. The rule in the _Lotus Case_ was disapproved by the
International Law Commission (_see_ Report on the work of its
eighth session, 1956) and by the Conference at Brussels in
1952, which adopted the Convention for the Unification of
Certain Rules relating to Penal Jurisdiction in Matters of
Collision and other Incidents of Navigation. Article 11 of the
Convention on the High Seas now provides for the exclusive
jurisdiction of the flag State in penal or disciplinary proceedings
arising out of collision cases, subject to penal and disciplinary
jurisdiction being conceded to a non-flag State over an accused
person of its nationality, or the holder of a master's certificate,
etc., issued by it. The general rules to be observed for prevent-
ing collisions at sea are set out in an annex to the Final Act of
the London Conference of 1960 on the Safety of Life at Sea;
these came into operation generally on September 1, 1965.
Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas
Fears that modern technical improvements in fishing, leading
to unrestricted exploitation, might deplete the living resources
of the high seas, have prompted efforts to devise an international
regime to ensure conservation. In the absence of general
control by an international organ, any such regime must
depend on individual and collective action by States to super-
vise conservation measures.
This indeed is the purpose of the Convention on Fishing and
Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas, signed
at Geneva on April 29, 1958, and drawn up by the first Con-
ference on the Law of the Sea. It supplements a number of
existing regional treaties of fishery conservation.
1 The Convention is based upon Draft Articles drawn up by the International
Law Commission. Article 20 provides that after the expiration of a period of
five years from the entry into force of the Convention, a request for revision
of the Convention may be made by any party, and the United Nations General
Assembly may decide upon the steps, if any, to be taken in respect of such
request.

------
Chap. 8.--- Jurisdiction
283
Article 1 reaffirms the right of free fishing in the open sea;
it recognises that the nationals of all States may freely engage
in fishing on the high seas subject to their treaty obligations,
to the interests and rights of coastal States under the Conven-
tion, and the provisions as to conservation in the Convention.
It also imposes on all States the duty to adopt, or to co-operate
with other States in adopting such measures for their respective
nationals1 as may be necessary for conservation.
The principal provisions of the Convention, other than
Article 1 may be summarised as follows:---

(a) A State whose
nationals fish any stock or stocks in any area of the high seas,
not exploited by citizens of other States, is duty bound to edict
conservation measures for its own nationals in that area, when
necessary. (b) If the nationals of two or more States are
engaged in fishing the same stock or stocks in any area or areas,
these States are to prescribe conservation measures by common
agreement, and, failing agreement are to resort to arbitration.2

(c) A coastal State has a special interest in the maintenance of
the productivity of the living resources of the high seas in any
area adjacent to its territorial sea; even if its nationals do not
operate in these areas, it is entitled to participate in collective
controls, and it has the right in the absence of agreement with
other States concerned, to introduce unilateral measures of
conservation appropriate to any stock, provided that these are
urgently necessary, are based on appropriate scientific findings,
and do not discriminate against foreign fishermen. (d) Any
State which, even if its nationals are not engaged in fishing in
an area not adjacent to its coast, has a special interest in con-
servation in that area, may agree with the State or States whose
nationals are engaged in fishing there, on conservation measures,
and failing agreement, may resort to arbitration. (e) The
primary method of arbitration is to be by reference to a special
Thus excluding the enforcement of such measures against the nationals of
other States.
* This word is used, although the Convention does not refer to the process
  of reference thereunder as arbitration". Article 5 deals with the position,
  both as to (a) and (b), where nationals of other States subsequently engage in
  fishing the same stock or stocks.

Developments since 1958 in the Law of the High Seas
The subject of developments since 1958 in the law of the high
seas has been treated in the preceding chapter (_see_ pp. 230--236).
6.-JURISDICTION ACCORDING TO THE UNIVERSAL
PRINCIPLE: PIRACY
An offence subject to universal jurisdiction is one which
comes under the jurisdiction of all States wherever it be
committed. Inasmuch as by general admission, the offence is
contrary to the interests of the international community, it is
treated as a delict _jure gentium_ and all States are entitled to
apprehend and punish the offenders. Clearly the purpose of
conceding universal jurisdiction is to ensure that no such
offence goes unpunished.
There are probably today only two clear-cut cases of universal
jurisdiction, namely the crime of piracy _jure gentium_, and war
crimes (_see below_, pp. 518--520). All States are entitled to
arrest pirates on the high seas, and to punish them irrespective
of nationality, and of the place of commission of the crime.
The principle of universality of punishment of war crimes was
affirmed by the Geneva Conventions of 1949 relative to
prisoners of war, protection of civilians, and sick and wounded
personnel. In the Eichmann Case (1962), the Supreme Court
1 A European Fisheries Convention was signed at London on March 9,
1964, partly to extend limits of territorial fishery waters, partly for conserva.
tion purposes (_see_ Article 4); it distinctly recognises the special interest and
legal authority of the coastal State, subject to a duty not to discriminate and
to consult upon request (_see_ Article 5).
* The transport of slaves is not such a case; a State may prevent and
  punish the transport of slaves only in ships authorised to fly its flag, or prevent
  the unlawful use of its flag for that purpose (Article 13 of the Convention
  on the High Seas).

------
Chap. 8.---Jurisdiction
285
of Israel, sitting as a Court of Appeal, relied in part upon the
principle of universal jurisdiction in upholding the conviction
by a Court in Israel of Eichmann, a war criminal, for war
crimes and crimes against humanity, thereby overruling ob-
objections that Eichmann's actions occurred in Europe during
the Second World War before the State of Israel was actually
founded, and that his offences were committed against people
who were not citizens of that State.
Crimes or delicts _jure gentium_, other than piracy and war
crimes, raise somewhat different considerations. Thus the
offences of drug trafficking, trafficking in women and children,
and counterfeiting of currency have been brought within the
scope of international Conventions, but have been dealt with
on the basis of " aut punire, aut dedere", that is, the offenders
are either to be punished by the State on whose territory they
are found or to be surrendered (extradited) to the State which
is competent and desirous of exercising jurisdiction over them.
This is so even with the international crime of genocide under
the Genocide Convention of 1948 (_see_ Article VI, which pro-
vides for a trial by the Courts of the State in the territory of
which the crime was committed, or by an international tribunal,
and hence not by the Courts of all States).
Piracy _Jure Gentium_
In its jurisdictional aspects, the offence of piracy _jure gentium_
is quite unique. A pirate is subject to arrest, trial, and punish-
ment by all States on the ground that he is an enemy of mankind
(hostis humani generis). The ship or aircraft involved is
similarly subject to seizure by all States. By his conduct, the
pirate is deemed automatically to lose the protection of his
flag State and any privileges due to him by virtue of his
nationality.
1
As to which, _see_ Historical Survey of the Question of International Criminal
Jurisdiction (United Nations Secretariat, 1949), at pp. 1 _et seq._
* So far is this the case that the taking of property by a pirate _jure gentium_
  does not divest the title of the true owner (pirata non mutat dominium); _see_
  Oppenheim, International Law, Vol. I (8th Edition, 1955), pp. 616--617.

286
Part 3.--Rights, etc., of States
Formerly it sufficed to define piracy as meaning simply
murder or robbery on the high seas by persons who were in
effect outlaws. But this definition was gradually widened to
bring it into line with conditions not prevalent when the
customary rules on the subject were first evolved. According
to Article 15 of the Convention on the High Seas of April 29,
1958, piracy consists of any illegal acts of violence, detention,
or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by
those aboard a private ship or private aircraft, and directed,
either on the high seas, against a ship or aircraft, or persons
or property thereon, or, in territory or waters of the nature of
terra nullius (i.e. not under the jurisdiction of any State) against
a ship or aircraft or persons or property thereon. It also
includes acts of an accessory nature to the main offence; e.g.
inciting. In 1934, it had been held by the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council, in the case of _Re Piracy Jure Gentium_,
that actual robbery was not an essential element of the crime
of piracy, and that a frustrated attempt to commit a robbery on
the high seas could be considered piracy. It follows from this
now extended meaning of piracy that the offence may be
prompted by motives other than gain, e.g. revenge. Moreover,
the instrument of the offence may be an aircraft as well as a
ship, while the victim may be another aircraft, provided that it
is on the high seas or in terra nullius.
Because of the operative words "committed for private
ends", acts inspired by political motives and which would
otherwise be treated as piratical, do not constitute piracy _jure
gentium_. In respect to the other operative words " against
another ship or aircraft or against persons or property
board, it has been claimed that the hijacking of an aircraft can
never be piracy _jure gentium_, because the offence is committed
within " and not against the aircraft, nor against the persons
or property on board.
At the outset, it is necessary to distinguish piracy at inter-
national law and piracy at municipal law. Under the laws of
on
1 (1934) A.C. 586.

------
Chap. 8.- Jurisdiction
287
certain States, acts may be treated as piratical which are not
strictly speaking acts of piracy _jure gentium_. For example,
under English criminal law the transport of slaves on the
high seas is piracy, but is not so according to international law.
In the same way, one must distinguish piracy _jure gentium_ from
acts (such as, e.g., arms running) which may be deemed to be
piracy under bilateral treaties or under joint declarations of
policy by States, for the strict meaning of piracy _jure gentium_
cannot be extended by such treaties, or by joint declarations,
designed to govern only the relations between the States
subscribing to them.
Private vessels or aircraft only can commit piracy, except
that a public vessel or aircraft under the control of a crew which
has mutinied may be treated as private, if the crew commit
piratical acts (Article 16 of the Convention on the High Seas).
A man-of-war or other public ship under the orders of a recog-
nised Government or recognised belligerent Power is not a
pirate. Difficulties in this connection have arisen when hostili-
ties at sea have been conducted by insurgents in the course of
a civil war. Obviously it is to the interests of the legitimate
parent Government to declare that the insurgent vessels are
pirates and to put them at the mercy of the navies of the great
maritime Powers. The British practice, however, has been not
to treat these insurgent vessels as pirates so long as they abstain
from repeated or wilful acts of violence against the lives and
property of British subjects. It would seem, however, that
insurgent units, which commit acts of violence or depredation,
in no way connected with the insurrection, such as entirely
arbitrary attacks upon foreign shipping, may legitimately be
treated as guilty of piracy _jure gentium_.
1 _See_, however, Oppenheim, International Law, Vol. I (8th Edition, 1955),
p. 613. Examples of such treaties are:---

(a) the abortive Treaty concluded at
the Washington Naval Conference of 1922 providing that persons violating
the humane rules of maritime warfare should be tried and punished "as if
for an act of piracy"; and (b) the Nyon Arrangement of 1937 for joint
action by the European Powers to prevent sinkings of merchant vessels in the
Mediterranean by unidentified submarines during the course of the Spanish
Civil War, which attacks were referred to as piratical acts". As to the
inapt use of the word "pirate as applied to offshore radio stations in the
North Sea area, _see_ p. 280, n. 2, _ante_.

------
288
Part 3.---Rights, etc., of States
A test is sometimes suggested for distinguishing the un-
licensed violence of piracy from the recognised action permitted
to insurgents, namely that there is an insurgent government or
administration with which foreign States may conduct relations,
and which is capable of assuming responsibility for the acts of
those serving in its armed forces. The test therefore is whether
the insurgent vessels are acting under the orders of a responsible
government against which a State, affected by any injury to
its citizens, may obtain redress according to the recognised
principles of international law. Inasmuch as the essence of
piracy is the absence of any government which can be held
responsible for the piratical acts, it follows that generally speak-
ing, apart from the circumstances in which the acts were com-
mitted (e.g., if such acts consist of entirely arbitrary attacks
upon foreign shipping), the offence of piracy is negatived if
there be such a government.
The seizure of piratical vessels or aircraft should be carried
out only by warships or military aircraft, or other ships or
aircraft on government service authorised to that effect (_see_
Article 21 of the Convention on the High Seas).
7.- PROBLEMS OF JURISDICTION WITH REGARD TO
AIRCRAFT
One consequence of the increase in the volume, range,
and frequency of the international air traffic, coupled with the
growing number of countries in which the aircraft of regular
airlines are registered, has been the emergence of difficult
problems of jurisdiction in respect to offences committed on
board aircraft in flight. If this were not enough, another
development has been the grave menace to the safety and
reliability of international civil aviation due to the multiplica-
tion of hijacking incidents, and of terrorist acts against aircraft
about to take off or land, and against airline passengers.
The first major attempt to deal with these problems was made
* In the case of the Ambrose Light (1885), 25 Fed. 408, an American Federal
  Court held that an armed vessel commissioned by Colombian insurgents was
  properly seized as a pirate because there had been no express recognition of the
  insurgents as belligerents.

------
Chap. 8.---Jurisdiction
289
by the Tokyo Convention of September 14, 1963, on Offences
and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft. The
main objects of the Convention were:---

(a) to ensure that
persons committing crimes aboard aircraft in flight, or on the
surface of the high seas, or any area outside the territory of any
country, or committing acts aboard such aircraft to the danger
of air safety, would not go unpunished simply because no
country would assume jurisdiction to apprehend or try them;

(b) for protective and disciplinary purposes, to give special
authority and powers to the aircraft commander, members of the
crew, and even passengers. Aircraft used in military, customs, or
police services were excluded from the scope of the Convention.
Normally, it is the subjacent State which exercises jurisdiction
over offences committed in its airspace, but an over-flying air-
craft may not have landed or been called upon to land, with the
result that the subjacent authorities are deprived of the
opportunity of taking police action, or the commission of the
offence may not have been noticed until the aircraft reaches a
destination outside the territory of the country in whose air-
space the offence was committed. Object (a) was achieved
principally by providing that the country of registration of the
aircraft is competent to exercise jurisdiction over the offences
and acts mentioned, and by obliging States parties to the
Convention to take the necessary measures to establish their
jurisdiction as the country of registration (_see_ Article 3).
Coupled with this was the provision in Article 16 that offences
committed aboard an aircraft are for purposes of extradition
to be treated as if they had occurred also in the territory
of the country of registration; hence, if the offender takes
refuge in a country which is party to the Convention and
also party to an extradition treaty with the country of registra-
tion, making the alleged offence an extradition crime, the
offender can be duly extradited. The Convention did not
exclude the criminal jurisdiction of countries which exercise
this according to the active nationality principle or passive
nationality principle.
The Convention contained detailed provisions giving effect
to object (b), and enabling the aircraft commander to disembark

------
290
Part 3.-Rights, etc., of States
an offender and deliver him, if necessary, to the competent
authorities of a State party to the Convention. However,
these provisions are not to apply in the airspace of the country
of registration of the aircraft, and they apply to overflights
across the high seas or territory outside the territory of any
country only where:---


(i) the last point of take-off or next point
of intended landing is situated in a country, not the country of
registration; or (ii) the aircraft subsequently flies into the air-
space of a country not that of registration, with the offender
still on board.
With regard to hijacking, it is fair to say that the Tokyo
Convention made no frontal attack upon this offence, but
dealt in only a limited manner with hijackers; for example, by
enabling hijackers to be taken into custody or subjected to
restraint in the same manner as other offenders, and by provid-
ing for restoration of control of the hijacked aircraft to the
lawful commander, and for the continuance of the journey of
passengers and crew.
A more ambitious, more elaborate effort to deal with hijack-
ing was made in the Hague Convention for the Suppression
of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, opened for signature on
December 16, 1970. By this date, hijacking had assumed the
proportions of a world-wide problem, which threatened to
undermine international aviation. The Convention was con-
fined to hijacking, leaving the matter of armed attacks, sabotage,
and other forms of violent action directed against civil aviation
and aviation facilities to be dealt with by a later diplomatic
conference. The Convention did not fully apply the aut
punire, aut dedere principle (i.e., the country where the offender
might happen to be should prosecute him, or extradite him to
a country having jurisdiction to try him for the offence), but
provided a reasonably adequate framework for the exercise of
jurisdiction, with obligations of extradition or rendition
according to the existence of an extradition treaty or of a
reciprocal practice of rendition.
The key provisions in the Convention are Article 1, defining
the offence of hijacking, although not calling it such, Article 2,
obliging each State party to make the offence punishable by

------
Chap. 8.---Jurisdiction
291
severe penalties, and Article 4, providing that States parties
are to take measures to establish jurisdiction over the offence
and related acts of violence against passengers or air crew.
The offence is defined as unlawfully, by force or threat, or by
any other form of intimidation, seizing or exercising control
of an aircraft" in flight ", or attempting to commit such an act,
or being the accomplice of any person performing or attempting
to perform such an act. Under Article 3, paragraph 1, an
aircraft is considered to be "in flight" at any time from the
moment when all its external doors are closed following em-
barkation until the moment when any such door is opened for
disembarkation. In the case of a forced landing---and
experience has shown this may be an important point-the
"
flight" is deemed to continue until the competent authorities
take over responsibility for the aircraft and for persons and
property on board. Under Article 4 (_see above_), jurisdiction
is to be established by contracting States in the following
cases :---
-(a) when the offence is committed on board an air-
craft registered in the contracting State; (b) when the hijacked
aircraft lands in a contracting State's territory with the alleged
hijacker still on board; (c) when the offence is committed on
board an aircraft leased without crew to a lessee who has his
principal place of business in the contracting State, or---if no
business---his permanent residence there.
The Convention applies only to civil aircraft, and not to
aircraft used in military, customs, or police services, but it is
immaterial whether the aircraft is engaged in an international
or domestic flight. However, for general purposes, the Con-
vention is only operative if the place of take-off, or the place
of actual landing of the hijacked aircraft be situated outside
the territory of the State in which the aircraft is registered.
This restriction does not affect the far-reaching provisions in
Article 6 for taking custody of a hijacker or alleged hijacker
present in a contracting State's territory, in Article 7 for the
obligatory prosecution of non-extradited alleged hijackers, in
Article 8 for the inclusion of hijacking as an extraditable offence
in extradition treaties or the treatment of the offence as an
extraditable one in the relations between States which surrender

------
292
Part 3.---Rights, etc., of States
alleged offenders on a basis other than that of an extradition
treaty, and in Article 10 for mutual co-operation between
States in relation to criminal proceedings against alleged
hijackers, for these provisions in Articles 6 to 10 are to apply
whatever the place of take-off or the place of actual landing of
the hijacked aircraft, if the hijacker or alleged hijacker is found
in the territory of a State other than the State of registration of
that aircraft.
The Hague Convention is not as stringent as it should be,
and throughout reflects a compromise between different
approaches to criminal law and to the rendition of offenders, but
its prompt conclusion, in the surrounding circumstances, did
meet an urgent need.
