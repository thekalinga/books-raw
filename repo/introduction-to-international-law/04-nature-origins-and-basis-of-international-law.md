## NATURE, ORIGINS AND BASIS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW

### NATURE AND ORIGINS

#### Definition

International law may be defined as that body of law which is
composed for its greater part of the principles and rules of
conduct which States feel themselves bound to observe, and
therefore, do commonly observe in their relations with each
other,[^1/1] and which includes also :---

(a) the rules of law relating to the functioning of international
institutions or organisations, their relations
with each other, and their relations with States and
individuals; and

(b) certain rules of law relating to individuals and non-State
entities so far as the rights or duties of such
individuals and non-State entities are the concern of
the international community.

This definition goes beyond the traditional definition of
international law as a system composed solely of rules governing
the relations between States only. Such traditional definition
of the subject, with its restriction to the conduct of States
_inter se_, will be found set out in the majority of the older
standard works of international law, but in view of developments
during the last three decades, it cannot stand as a
comprehensive description of all the rules now acknowledged
to form part of the subject.

These developments are principally :---

(i) the establishment
of a large number of permanent international institutions or
organisations such as, for example the United Nations and
the World Health Organisation, regarded as possessing international
legal personality, and entering into relations with
each other and with States; and

(ii) the present movement
(sponsored by the United Nations and the Council of Europe)
to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals,[^2/1]
the creation of new rules for the punishment of persons
committing the international crime of genocide or race destruction,[^2/2]
and the imposition of duties on individuals under the
historic judgment in 1946 of the International Military Tribunal
of Nuremberg, by which certain acts were declared to
be international crimes, namely, crimes against peace, crimes
against humanity, and conspiracy to commit these crimes.[^2/3]
Both categories of developments have given rise to new rules
of international law, and may be expected to influence the
growth of new rules in the future. The definition given above
is intended to cover such new rules under heads (a)[^2/4] and (b).

Nevertheless, from the practical point of view, it is well to
remember that international law is primarily a system regulating
the rights and duties of States _inter se_. So much is hinted at
in the very title "international law", or in another title
frequently given to the subject---"the law of nations ", although
strictly speaking the word "nation" is only in a crude way a
synonym for the word "State".[^3/1] Indeed, it is a very good
practical working rule to regard international law as mainly
composed of principles whereby certain rights belong to, or
certain duties are imposed upon States.

Nevertheless, although the principal component of the system
is represented by binding rules, imposing duties and conferring
rights upon States, international lawyers have now
increasingly to concern themselves with _desiderata_, guidelines,
and recommended standards expressed in a non-binding form
(e.g., as in the Declarations adopted by the United Nations
General Assembly, the Recommendations of the International
Labour Conference, and the Recommendations of the periodical
Consultative Meetings held under the Antarctic Treaty of
1959), but which many States concerned feel constrained to
observe. These may indeed eventually evolve into binding
legal rules, e.g., by general acceptance or approval (_cf._ Article
IX, paragraph 4 of the Treaty on Antarctica of 1959, under
which recommended measures may become "effective"
upon approval by the parties concerned).

The main object of international law has been to produce
an ordered rather than a just system of international relations,
yet in later developments (for example, in the rules as to State
responsibility concerning denial of justice,[^3/2] and in the rules
and practice as to international arbitration) there has been
evidence of some striving to ensure that, objectively, justice be
done between States. Moreover, apart from seeing that States
receive just treatment, the modern law of nations aims at
securing justice for human beings. It is significant further
that the word "Justice" appears in the titles respectively of
the Permanent Court of International Justice and its successor
the International Court of Justice, both being judicial tribunals
set up to decide disputes between States and to give advisory
opinions according to international law.[^4/1] That justice is a
primary purpose of the law of nations emphasises its kinship
to State law.

#### General and Regional Rules of International Law; Community Law

There is a recognised distinction between general and regional
rules of international law, that is to say between, on the one
hand, rules which, practically speaking, are of universal
application,[^4/2] and, on the other hand, rules which have developed
in a particular region of the world as between the States there
located, without becoming rules of a universal character. The
best illustration of such regional rules are those which have been
commonly followed by the group of Latin American States, for
example, the special rules relating to diplomatic asylum. This
so-called "Latin American international law" and the nature
of regional rules were discussed by the International Court of
Justice in the Colombian-Peruvian Asylum Case (1950);[^4/3] according
to the judgments in this case :---

(a) regional rules are not
necessarily subordinate to general rules of international law,
but may be in a sense "complementary" or "correlated" thereto,
and

(b) an international tribunal must, as between States in
the particular region concerned, give effect to such regional
rules as are duly proved to the satisfaction of the tribunal.

In this connection, there may perhaps be noted also the
modern tendency towards regionalism in international organisation,
reflected in the fusion of States into regional "functional "
groupings (for example the European Economic Community
(Common Market) under the Treaty of Rome of March 25,
1957, establishing this Community), the conclusion of regional
security treaties (for example, the North Atlantic Security Pact
of April 4, 1949[^5/1]), the creation of regional international organs
(for example, the South Pacific Commission established in
1948), and the establishment of regional international tribunals
(for example, the Court originally established by Articles 31--45
of the Treaty constituting the European Coal and Steel Community
of April 18, 1951, and which is now the Court of Justice
of this Community, of the European Economic Community
(Common Market), and of the European Atomic Energy Community
(EURATOM) under the Rome Convention of March
25, 1957, Relating to Certain Institutions common to the
European Communities).

The common rules (including the judge-made law of the
Court) applicable within the legal and administrative framework
of the European Communities have developed to such an
extent since 1957 as to merit the designation of "Community
Law" (_droit communitaire_).[^5/2] One of the distinctive characteristics
of this Community Law may be its direct applicability,
in certain cases and under certain conditions, in the systems of
national law of each member of the European Communities,
with national Courts also ready to give effect to Community
Law where its primacy ought to be recognised,[^5/3] e.g., if the
Community rule or norm is clear and precise, and unconditional,
without the need for further implementary action.

#### Origins and Development of International Law

The modern system of international law is a product, roughly
speaking, of only the last four hundred years. It grew to
some extent out of the usages and practices of modern European
States in their intercourse and communications, while it still
bears witness to the influence of writers and jurists of the
sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, who first
formulated some of its most fundamental tenets. Moreover,
it remains tinged with concepts such as national and territorial
sovereignty, and the perfect equality and independence of
States, that owe their force to political theories underlying the
modern European State system, although, curiously enough,
some of these concepts have commanded the support of newly
emerged non-European States.

But any historical account of the system must begin with
earliest times, for even in the period of antiquity rules of conduct
to regulate the relations between independent communities
were felt necessary and emerged from the usages observed by
these communities in their mutual relations. Treaties, the
immunities of ambassadors, and certain laws and usages of
war are to be found many centuries before the dawn of
Christianity, for example in ancient Egypt and India,[^6/1] while
there were historical cases of recourse to arbitration and
mediation in ancient China and in the early Islamic world,
although it would be wrong to regard these early instances as
representing any serious contribution towards the evolution
of the modern system of international law.

We find, for example, in the period of the Greek City States,
small but independent of one another, evidence of an embryonic,
although regionally limited, form of international law which
one authority---Professor Vinogradoff---aptly described as
"intermunicipal"[^6/2]. This "intermunicipal" law was composed
of customary rules which had crystallised into law from
long-standing usages followed by these cities such as, for
instance, the rules as to the inviolability of heralds in battle, the
need for a prior declaration of war, and the enslavement of
prisoners of war. These rules were applied not only in the
relations _inter se_ of these sovereign Greek cities, but as between
them and neighbouring States. Underlying the rules there were,
however, deep religious influences, characteristic of an era in
which the distinctions between law, morality, justice and
religion were not sharply drawn.

In the period of Rome's dominance of the ancient world,
here also emerged rules governing the relations between Rome
and the various nations or peoples with which it had contact.
One significant aspect of these rules was their legal character,
thus contrasting with the religious nature of the customary
rules observed by the Greek City States. But Rome's main
contribution to the development of international law was less
through these rules than through the indirect influence of
Roman Law generally, inasmuch as when the study of Roman
Law was revived at a later stage in Europe, it provided analogies
and principles capable of ready adaptation to the regulation of
relations between modern States.

Actually, the total direct contribution of the Greeks and
Romans to the development of international law was relatively
meagre. Conditions favourable to the growth of a modern
law of nations did not really come into being until the fifteenth
century, when in Europe there began to evolve a number of
independent civilised States.[^7/1] Before that time Europe had
passed through various stages in which either conditions were
so chaotic as to make impossible any ordered rules of conduct
between nations, or the political circumstances were such that
there was no necessity for a code of international law. Thus
in the later period of Roman history with the authority of the
Roman Empire extending over the whole civilised world, there
were no independent States in any sense, and therefore a law
of nations was not called for. During the early medieval
era, there were two matters particularly which militated against
the evolution of a system of international law :---

(a) the temporal
and spiritual unity of the greater part of Europe under the
Holy Roman Empire, although to some extent this unity was
notional and belied by numerous instances of conflict and
disharmony; and

(b) the feudal structure of Western Europe,
hinging on a hierarchy of authority which not only clogged the
emergence of independent States but also prevented the Powers
of the time from acquiring the unitary character and authority
of modern sovereign States.

Profound alterations occurred in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. The discovery of the New World, the Renaissance
of learning, and the Reformation as a religious revolution
disrupted the facade of the political and spiritual unity of
Europe, and shook the foundations of medieval Christendom.
Theories were evolved to meet the new conditions; intellectually,
the secular conceptions of a modern sovereign State
and of a modern independent Sovereign found expression
in the works of Bodin (1530--1596), a Frenchman, Machiavelli
(1469--1527), an Italian, and later in the seventeenth century,
Hobbes (1588--1679), an Englishman.

With the growth of a number of independent States there
was initiated, as in early Greece, the process of formation of
customary rules of international law from the usages and
practices followed by such States in their mutual relations. So
in Italy with its multitude of small independent States, maintaining
diplomatic relations with each other and with the
outside world, there developed a number of customary rules
relating to diplomatic envoys, for example, their appointment,
reception and inviolability.[^8/1]

An important fact also was that by the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries jurists had begun to take into account the evolution
of a community of independent sovereign States and to think
and write about different problems of the law of nations,
realising the necessity for some body of rules to regulate
certain aspects of the relations between such States. Where
there were no established customary rules, these jurists were
obliged to devise and fashion working principles by reasoning
or analogy. Not only did they draw on the principles of
Roman Law which had become the subject of revived study in
Europe as from the end of the eleventh century onwards, but
they had recourse also to the precedents of ancient history, to
theology, to the canon law, and to the semi-theological concept
of the "law of nature"---a concept which for centuries
exercised a profound influence on the development of international
law.[^9/1] Among the early writers who made important
contributions to the infant science of the law of nations were
Vittoria (1480--1546), who was Professor of Theology in the
University of Salamanca, Belli (1502--1575), an Italian, Brunus
(1491--1563), a German, Fernando Vasquez de Menchaca
(1512--1569), a Spaniard, Ayala (1548--1584), a jurist of Spanish
extraction, Suarez (1548--1617), a great Spanish Jesuit, and
Gentilis (1552--1608), an Italian who became Professor of Civil
Law at Oxford, and who is frequently regarded as the founder
of a systematic law of nations.[^9/2] The writings of these early
jurists reveal significantly that one major preoccupation of
sixteenth century international law was the law of warfare
between States, and in this connection it may be noted that by
the fifteenth century the European Powers had begun to
maintain standing armies, a practice which naturally caused
uniform usages and practices of war to evolve.

By general acknowledgment the greatest of the early writers
on international law was the Dutch scholar, jurist, and
diplomat, Grotius (1583--1645), whose systematic treatise on
the subject _De Jure Belli ac Pacis_ (The Law of War and Peace)
first appeared in 1625. On account of this treatise, Grotius
has sometimes been described as the "father of the law of
nations ", although it is maintained by some that such a
description is incorrect on the grounds that his debt to the
writings of Gentilis is all too evident[^10/1] and that in point of time
he followed writers such as Belli, Ayala and others mentioned
above. Indeed both Gentilis and Grotius owed much to their
precursors.

Nor is it exact to affirm that in _De Jure Belli ac Pacis_ will
be found all the international law that existed in 1625. It
cannot, for example, be maintained that Grotius dealt fully
with the law and practice of his day as to treaties, or that his
coverage of the rules and usages of warfare was entirely comprehensive.[^10/2]
Besides, _De Jure Belli ac Pacis_ was not primarily
or exclusively a treatise on international law, as it embraced
numerous topics of legal science, and touched on problems
of philosophic interest. Grotius's historical pre-eminence
rests rather on his continued inspirational appeal as the creator
of the first adequate comprehensive framework of the modern
science of international law.

In his book, as befitted a diplomat of practical experience,
and a lawyer who had practised, Grotius dealt repeatedly with
the actual customs followed by the States of his day. At the
same time Grotius was a theorist who espoused certain doctrines.
One central doctrine in his treatise was the acceptance
of the "law of nature" as an independent source of rules of
the law of nations, apart from custom and treaties. The
Grotian "law of nature" was to some extent a secularised
version, being founded primarily on the dictates of reason,
on the rational nature of men as social human beings, and in
that form it was to become a potent source of inspiration to
later jurists.

Grotius has had an abiding influence upon international law
and international lawyers, although the extent of this influence
has fluctuated at different periods, and his actual impact upon
the practice of States was never so considerable as is traditionally
represented. While it would be wrong to say that his
views were always treated as being of compelling authority---
frequently they were the object of criticism---nevertheless his
principal work, _De Jure Belli ac Pacis_, was continually relied
upon as a work of reference and authority in the decisions of
Courts, and in the text-books of later writers of standing. Also
several Grotian doctrines have left their mark on, and are
implicit in the character of modern international law, namely,
the distinction between just and unjust war,[^11/1] the recognition
of the rights and freedoms of the individual, the doctrine of
qualified neutrality, the idea of peace, and the value of periodic
conferences between the rulers of States.

The history of the law of nations during the two centuries
after Grotius was marked by the final evolution of the modern
State-system in Europe, a process greatly influenced by the
Treaty of Westphalia of 1648 marking the end of the Thirty
Years' War, and by the development from usage and practice
of a substantial body of new customary rules. Even relations
and intercourse by treaty or otherwise between European and
Asian governments or communities contributed to the formation
of these rules. Moreover the science of international law
was further enriched by the writings and studies of a number
of great jurists. Side by side there proceeded naturally a kind
of action and reaction between the customary rules and the
works of these great writers; not only did their systematic
treatment of the subject provide the best evidence of the rules,
but they suggested new rules or principles where none had yet
emerged from the practice of States. The influence of these
great jurists on the development of international law was
considerable, as can be seen from their frequent citation by
national courts during the nineteenth century and even up to
the present time.

The most outstanding writers of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries following the appearance of Grotius's
treatise were Zouche (1590--1660), Professor of Civil Law at
Oxford and an Admiralty Judge, Pufendorf (1632--1694),
Professor at the University of Heidelberg, Bynkershoek
(1673--1743), a Dutch jurist, Wolff (1679--1754), a German
jurist and philosopher, who constructed an original, systematic
methodology of international law and the "law of nature",
Moser (1701--1795), a German Professor of Law, von Martens
(1756--1821), also a German Professor of Law, and Vattel
(1714--1767), a Swiss jurist and diplomat, who was greatly
influenced by the writings of Wolff, and who perhaps of these
seven men proved to have the greatest influence. In the
eighteenth century, there was a growing tendency among
jurists to seek the rules of international law mainly in custom
and treaties, and to relegate to a minor position the "law of
nature", or reason, as a source of principles. This tendency
was extremely marked, for instance, in the case of Bynkershoek's
writings and found expression particularly also in the works of
Moser, and von Martens. There were, however, jurists who at
the same time clung to the traditions of the "law of nature",
either almost wholly, or coupled with a lesser degree of emphasis
upon custom and treaties as components of international
law. As contrasted with these adherents to the "law of
nature", writers such as Bynkershoek who attached primary or
major weight to customary and treaty rules were known as
"positivists".

In the nineteenth century international law further expanded.
This was due to a number of factors which fall more properly
within the scope of historical studies, for instance, the further
rise of powerful new States both within and outside Europe,
the expansion of European civilisation overseas, the modernisation
of world transport, the greater destructiveness of modern
warfare, and the influence of new inventions. All these made
it urgent for the international society of States to acquire a
system of rules which would regulate in an ordered manner
the conduct of international affairs. There was a remarkable
development during the century in the law of war and neutrality,
and the great increase in adjudications by international arbitral
tribunals following the Alabama Claims Award of 1872 provided
an important new source of rules and principles. Besides,
States commenced to acquire the habit of negotiating general
treaties in order to regulate affairs of mutual concern. Nor
was the nineteenth century without its great writers on international
law. The works of jurists belonging to a number of
different nations contributed significantly to the scientific
treatment of the subject; among them were Kent (American),
Wheaton (American), De Martens (Russian), Klüber (German),
Phillimore (British) Calvo (Argentinian), Fiore (Italian),
Pradier-Fodéré (French), Bluntschli (German), and Hall
(British). The general tendency of these writers was to
concentrate on existing practice, and to discard the concept of
the "law of nature", although not abandoning recourse to
reason and justice where, in the absence of custom or treaty
rules, they were called upon to speculate as to what should
be the law.

Other important developments have taken place in the
twentieth century. The Permanent Court of Arbitration was
established by the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907. The
Permanent Court of International Justice was set up in 1921
as an authoritative international judicial tribunal, and was
succeeded in 1946 by the present International Court of
Justice. Then there has been the creation of permanent
international organisations whose functions are in effect those
of world government in the interests of peace and human
welfare, such as the League of Nations and its present successor
---the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation,
the International Civil Aviation Organisation, and others
referred to in Chapter 19 of this book. And perhaps most
remarkable of all has been the widening scope of international
law to cover not only every kind of economic or social interest
affecting States, but also the fundamental rights and freedoms
of individual human beings.

It is characteristic of the latter-day evolution of international
law that the influence of writers has tended to decline, and
that modern international lawyers have come to pay far more
regard to practice and to decisions of tribunals. Yet the spelling
out of rules of international law from assumed trends of past
and current practice cannot be carried too far. This was
shown at the Geneva Conference of 1958 on the Law of the
Sea, and at the Vienna Conferences of 1961, 1963, and 1968--1969
on, respectively, Diplomatic Relations, Consular Relations,
and the Law of Treaties, when in a number of instances an
apparent weight of practice in favour of a proposed rule of
international law did not necessarily result in its general acceptance
by the States represented at the Conferences. Nevertheless,
"natural law" writers have ceased to command the
same degree of influence as formerly, perhaps because of the
emergence of a number of States outside Europe and which
did not inherit doctrines of Christian civilisation such as that
of "natural law". These new States (in particular the Afro-Asian
group) have challenged certain of the basic principles
of international law, stemming from its early European evolution
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.[^14/1] Moreover,
many long-standing rules and concepts of international law have
been subjected to severe strains and stresses under the impact
of modern developments in technology, of modern economic
exigencies, and---not least---the more enlightened sociological
views and attitudes which prevail today. Above all, there is
the present unprecedented political state of affairs, for which
the traditional system of international law was not devised,
namely, the division of the world into global and regional blocs,
the existence of a "third world" of numerous newly-emerged
States, undeveloped economically and technologically (and
sometimes possessing unstable governments), and the numerous
groupings and associations into which States have formed themselves.
Apart from this, international law is now called
upon to find new rules to govern the fields of nuclear and
thermonuclear energy, and scientific research generally, to
regulate state activities in the upper atmosphere and in the
cosmos, to protect and control the environment of man, and
to establish a new legal régime for the exploration and exploitation
of the resources of the seabed beyond the limits of
national sovereignty.

#### Present-Day Status of International Law

International law, as we know it today, is that indispensable
body of rules regulating for the most part the relations between
States, without which it would be virtually impossible for them
to have steady and frequent intercourse. It is in fact an
expression of the necessity of their mutual relationships. In
the absence of some system of international law, the international
society of States could not enjoy the benefits of trade
and commerce, of exchange of ideas, and of normal routine
communication.

The last half-century witnessed a greater impetus to the
development of international law than at any previous stage
of its history. This was a natural result of the growing interdependence
of States, and of the vastly increased intercourse
between them due to all kinds of inventions that overcame the
difficulties of time, space, and intellectual communication.
New rules had to be found or devised to meet innumerable
new situations. Whereas previously the international society
of States could rely on the relatively slow process of custom[^15/1]
for the formation of rules of international law, modern
exigencies called for a speedier method of law-making. As
a result, there came into being the great number of multilateral
treaties of the last seventy years laying down rules to be observed
by the majority of States --- "law-making treaties" or
" international legislation", as they have been called. Apart
from these "law-making treaties" there was a remarkable
development in the use of arbitration to settle international
disputes, and at the same time the Permanent Court of International
Justice came by its decisions to make an important
contribution to the growth of international law. The mantle
of the Permanent Court has now descended upon its successor,
the International Court of Justice. Nor should there be
forgotten the work of codifying and progressively developing
international law at present being sponsored by the United
Nations with the expert aid of a body known as the International
Law Commission, created in 1947.[^16/1]

It is true that in some quarters there is a tendency to disparage
international law, even to the extent of questioning its
existence and value. There are two main reasons for this:---

(a) the generally held view that the rules of international
law are designed only to maintain peace; and

(b) ignorance of the vast number of rules which, unlike
the rules dealing with "high policy", that is, issues of
peace or war, receive little publicity.

Actually, however, a considerable part of international law
is not concerned at all with issues of peace or war. In practice,
legal advisers to Foreign Offices and practising international
lawyers daily apply and consider settled rules of international
law dealing with an immense variety of matters. Some of
these important matters which arise over and over again in
practice are claims for injuries to citizens abroad, the reception
or deportation of aliens, extradition, questions of nationality,
and the interpretation of the numerous complicated treaties or
arrangements now entered into by most States with reference
to commerce, finance, transport, civil aviation, nuclear energy,
and many other subjects.

Breaches of international law resulting in wars or conflicts
of aggression tend to receive adverse attention, and from them
the public incorrectly deduces the complete breakdown of
international law. The answer to this criticism is that even
in wartime there is no absolute breakdown of international law,
as many rules affecting the relations of belligerents _inter se_ or
with neutrals are of vital importance and to a large extent are
strictly observed. Another consideration is worth mentioning.
Even in the case of war or armed conflict, the States
involved seek to justify their position by reference to international
law. This applies also in "crisis" situations,
short of war; for example, during the Cuban missile crisis of
1962, the United States relied to some extent on the Inter-American
Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance of 1947 as a legal
basis for its "selective" blockade of Cuba.

It is possible to argue further that in municipal law (that
is, State law), breaches, disturbances and crimes take place,
but no one denies the existence of law to which all citizens are
subject. Similarly, the recurrence of war and armed conflicts
between States does not necessarily involve the conclusion that
international law is non-existent.

Finally, it is incorrect to regard the maintenance of peace
as the entire purpose of international law. As one authority
well said,[^17/1] its _raison d'être_ is rather to

>form a framework within which international relations can
be conducted and to provide a system of rules facilitating
international intercourse; and as a matter of practical necessity
it has, and will, operate as a legal system even when wars are
frequent.

The same authority goes on to say :---

>It is, of course, true that the ideal of international law must
be a perfect legal system in which war will be entirely eliminated,
just as the ideal of municipal law is a Constitution and legal
system so perfect, that revolution, revolt, strikes, etc., can never
take place and every man's rights are speedily, cheaply, and
infallibly enforced.

Lapses from such ideals are as inevitable as the existence of
law itself.

### THEORIES AS TO BASIS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW

Much theoretical controversy has been waged over the
nature and basis of international law.
Some discussion of the theories should help to throw light
on many important aspects of the subject.

#### Is International Law True Law ?

One theory which has enjoyed wide acceptance is that
international law is not true law, but a code of rules of conduct
of moral force only.[^18/1] The English writer on jurisprudence,
Austin, must be regarded as foremost among the protagonists
of this theory. Others who have questioned the true legal
character of international law have been Hobbes, Pufendorf,
and Bentham.

Austin's attitude towards international law was coloured
by his theory of law in general. According to the Austinian
theory, law was the result of edicts issuing from a determinate
sovereign legislative authority. Logically, if the rules concerned
did not in ultimate analysis issue from a sovereign authority,
which was politically superior, or if there were no sovereign
authority, then the rules could not be legal rules, but rules of
moral or ethical validity only. Applying this general theory to
international law, as there was no visible authority with
legislative power or indeed with any determinate power over
the society of States, and as in his time the rules of international
law were almost exclusively customary, Austin concluded that
international law was not true law but "positive international
morality" only, analogous to the rules binding a club or
society. He further described it as consisting of "opinions
or sentiments current among nations generally".[^18/2]

The reply to Austin's view is as follows :---

(a) Modern historical jurisprudence has discounted the force
of his general theory of law. It has been shown that in many
communities without a formal legislative authority, a system
of law was in force and being observed, and that such law did
not differ in its binding operation from the law of any State
with a true legislative authority.

(b) Austin's views, however right for his time, are not true
of present-day international law. In the last half-century, a
great mass of "international legislation" has come into
existence as a result of "law-making treaties" and Conventions,
and the proportion of customary rules of international law
has correspondingly diminished.[^19/1] Even if it be true that
there is no determinate sovereign legislative authority in the
international field, the procedure for formulating these rules of
"international legislation" by means of international conferences
or through existing international organs is practically
as settled, if not as efficient, as any State legislative procedure.

(c) Questions of international law are always treated as
legal questions by those who conduct international business
in the various Foreign Offices, or through the various existing
international administrative bodies. In other words, the
authoritative agencies responsible for the maintenance of
international intercourse do not consider international law
as merely a moral code. As Sir Frederick Pollock has well
said :---

>If international law were only a kind of morality, the
framers of State papers concerning foreign policy would throw
all their strength on moral argument. But, as a matter of
fact, this is not what they do. They appeal not to the general
feeling of moral rightness, but to _precedents, to treaties, and to
opinions of specialists_. They assume the existence among
statesmen and publicists of a series of legal as distinguished
from moral obligations in the affairs of nations.[^19/2]

Certain countries indeed in practice expressly treat international
law as possessing the same force as the ordinary law
binding their citizens. Under the Constitution of the United
States of America, for example, treaties are "the supreme
law of the land" (Article VI, 82). Judges of the United States
Supreme Court---the highest Court of the land---have repeatedly
recognised the constitutional validity of international law.
In one case,[^20/1] Marshall, C.J., declared that an Act of Congress
"ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations
if any other possible construction remains". In another
case,[^20/2] Gray, J., made the following remarks :---

>International law is part of our law, and must be ascertained
and administered by the Courts of Justice of appropriate
jurisdiction, as often as questions of right depending upon it
are duly presented for their determination.

Moreover, the legally binding force of international law
has been asserted again and again by the nations of the world
in international conference. To take one illustration, the
Charter creating the United Nations Organisation, drawn up at
San Francisco in 1945, is both explicitly and implicitly based
on the true legality of international law. This is also clearly
expressed in the terms of the Statute of the International Court
of Justice, annexed to the Charter, where the Court's function
is stated as being "to decide in accordance with international
law such disputes as are submitted to it" (_see_ Article 38).

In connection with the Austinian theory, it is useful to
bear in mind the difference between rules of international law
proper, and the rules of "international comity". The former
are legally binding, while the latter are rules of goodwill and
civility, founded on the moral right of each State to receive
courtesy from others. The essence of these usages of "comity"
is thus precisely what Austin attributed to international law
proper, namely a purely moral quality.[^20/3] Non-observance of a
rule of international law may give rise to a claim by one State
against another for some kind of satisfaction, whether it be
diplomatic in character or whether it take the concrete form
of indemnity or reparation. Non-observance of a usage of
"comity" on the other hand produces no strict legal consequences
as regards the State withholding the courtesy; the
State affected by the withdrawal of the concession may reply
in the same kind and retract its own courtesy practices, but
beyond this narrow reciprocity, there is no other legal action
open to it.[^21/1]

This cumulative evidence against the position taken by
Austin and his followers should not blind us to the fact that
necessarily international law is _weak law_. Existing international
legislative machinery, operating mainly through lawmaking
Conventions, is not comparable in efficiency to State
legislative machinery. Frequently the rules expressed in such
Conventions are formulated in such a way as to give wide
options or areas of choice to the States parties (_see_, e.g., the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States, March 18, 1965). In spite
of the achievement of the United Nations in re-establishing a
World Court under the name of the International Court of
Justice, there still is no universal compulsory jurisdiction for
settling legal disputes between States. Finally, many of the rules
of international law can only be formulated with difficulty, and,
to say the least, are quite uncertain, being often incapable of
presentation except as a collection of inconsistent State practices,
while there are, in different areas of the subject, fundamental
disagreements as to what the rules should be. In
1960, the second Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea,
with eighty-seven States participating, failed to agree on a
general rule fixing the width of the territorial sea, thus repeating
the experience of the Hague Conference of 1930, while the
Vienna Conference on the Law of Treaties of 1968--1969
revealed basic differences over the rules as to invalidity of
treaties, and over the doctrine of _jus cogens_[^22/1] (superior principles
or norms governing the legality of treaty provisions).

#### Theories as to "Law of Nature"

From earliest times,[^22/2] as we have seen, the concept of the
"law of nature" exercised a signal influence on international
law. Several theories of the character and binding force of
international law were founded upon it.

At first the "law of nature" had semi-theological associations,
but Grotius to some extent secularised the concept, and
as his followers later applied it, it denoted the ideal law founded
on the nature of man as a reasonable being, the body of rules
which Nature dictates to human reason. On this basic
conception, theorists erected various structures, some writers
adopting the view that international law derived its binding
force from the fact that it was a mere application to particular
circumstances of the "law of nature". In other words,
States submitted to international law because their relations
were regulated by the higher law---the "law of nature", of
which international law was but a part. The concept of
the "law of nature" underwent further specialisation in the
eighteenth century. The later refinements can be seen in the
following passage from Vattel's _Droit des Gens_ (1758)[^22/3] :---

>We use the term necessary Law of Nations for that law
which results from applying the "natural law" to nations. It is
necessary, because nations are absolutely bound to observe it.
It contains those precepts which the "natural law" dictates to
States, and it is no less binding upon them than it is upon
individuals. For States are composed of men, their policies
are determined by men, and these men are subject to the
"natural law" under whatever capacity they act. This same
law is called by Grotius and his followers the internal Law of
Nations, inasmuch as it is binding upon the conscience of
nations. Several writers call it the natural Law of Nations.

Vattel's views in this connection led him to hold that the
assumption that one or more States could overview and control
the conduct of another State would be contrary to the "law of
nature".

The general objection to theories based on the "law of
nature" is that each theorist uses it as a metaphor for some
more concrete conception such as reason, justice, utility, the
general interests of the international community, necessity, or
religious dictates. This leads to a great deal of confusion,
particularly as these interpretations of the "law of nature"
may differ so widely.

Traces of the "natural law" theories survive today, albeit
in a much less dogmatic form. An approach kindred to that
of "natural law" colours the current movement to bind
States by international Covenants to observe human rights and
fundamental freedoms,[^23/1] while to some extent a "natural law"
philosophy underlies the Draft Declaration on the Rights and
Duties of States of 1949 prepared by the International Law
Commission of the United Nations.[^23/2] "Natural law" has
been invoked also in order to justify the punishment of offenders,
guilty of the grosser and more brutal kind of war crimes.
Besides, there are the writers who adopt an international
sociological standpoint, who treat the conception of "natural
law" as identical with reason and justice applied to the international
community, and who look upon it as thereby elucidating
the lines of the future development of international law.[^23/3]

Because of its rational and idealistic character, the conception
of the "law of nature" has had a tremendous influence---a
beneficent influence---on the development of international law.
If it has lacked precision, if it has tended to be a subjective
rather than an objective doctrine, it has at least generated
respect for international law, and provided, and still provides,
moral and ethical foundations that are not to be despised. As
against this, its main defect has been its aloofness from the
realities of international intercourse shown in the lack of
emphasis on the actual practice followed by States in their
mutual relations, although the majority of rules of international
law originally sprang from this practice.

#### Positivism

The theory known as "positivism" commands a wide
support, and has been adopted by a number of influential
writers. We have already seen that Bynkershoek was an
eighteenth-century "positivist", but the modern "positivist"
theories have refinements and are expressed in generalisations
not to be found in Bynkershoek's writings.

The "positivists" hold that the rules of international law
are in final analysis of the same character as "positive"
municipal law (i.e., State law) inasmuch as they also issue
from the will of the State. They believe that international
law can in logic be reduced to a system of rules depending for
their validity only on the fact that States have consented to
them.[^24/1]

Positivism begins from certain premises, that the State is a
metaphysical reality with a value and significance of its own,
and that endowed with such reality the State may also be
regarded as having a will. This psychological notion of a
State-will is derived from the great German philosopher,
Hegel. To the State-will, the "positivists" attribute complete
sovereignty and authority.

Pursuant to their initial assumptions, the "positivists" regard
international law as consisting of those rules which the
various State-wills have accepted by a process of voluntary
self-restriction, or as they have termed it, "auto-limitation".[^25/1]
Without such manifestation of consent, international law would
not be binding on the society of States. Zorn, one of the most
characteristic of the "positivists", indeed regarded international
law as a branch of State law, as external public law (äusseres
Staatsrecht), and only for that reason binding on the State.[^25/2]

The "positivists" concede that the difficulty in the application
of their theory relates to customary international law. They
admit that sometimes it is impossible to find an express
consent in treaties, State papers, public documents, diplomatic
notes, or the like, to being bound by particular customary rules.
They therefore, consistently with their consensual theory, argue
that in such exceptional cases the consent must be regarded as
"tacit" or "implied".[^25/3] This reasoning is often carried a stage
further by arguing that membership of the society of States
involves an implied consent to the binding operation of established
customary rules of international law. On the face of
it, this is begging the question, as such a general implied
consent could only be conditioned by some fundamental rule
of international law itself, and it would still be necessary to
explain the source and origin of this fundamental rule.

The outstanding positivist has been the Italian jurist Anzilotti,
later Judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice.
In Anzilotti's view, the binding force of international law can
be traced back to one supreme, fundamental principle or
norm, the principle that agreements between States are to
be respected, or as the principle is better known, _pacta sunt
servanda_. This norm _pacta sunt servanda_ is an absolute postulate
of the international legal system, and manifests itself in
one way or another in all the rules belonging to international
law. Consistently with this theory, Anzilotti holds that just
as in the case of treaties, customary rules are based on the
consent of States, and there is here an implied agreement.
The following passage from his treatise[^26/1] illustrates his views :---

> Every legal order consists of a complex of norms which
derive their obligatory character from a fundamental norm
to which they all relate, directly or indirectly. The fundamental
norm determines, in this way, which norms compose a given
legal order and gives unity to the whole. The international
legal order is distinguished by the fact that, in this order, the
principle _pacta sunt servanda_ does not depend, as in international
law, upon a superior norm; it is itself the supreme
norm. The rule according to which 'States must respect the
agreements concluded between them ', thus constitutes the
formal criterion which distinguishes the norms of which we
speak from other norms and gives unity to the whole; all
norms, and only the norms, which depend upon this principle
as the necessary and exclusive source of their obligatory character,
belong to the category of those with which we are concerned
here.

The main defect in this analysis is that the norm _pacta sunt
servanda_ is only partially an explanation of the binding force
of international law. Anzilotti's view that customary rules
are binding on States by virtue of an implied pactum (or treaty)
is no more convincing than the "tacit" consent arguments
of other "positivists".

The principal objections to positivism as a whole may be
formulated as follows :---

(1) The notion of the State-will is purely metaphorical, and
is used to express the fact that international law is binding on
the State. It does not explain the fact. For example, when a
treaty has been ratified by, say, Great Britain, we can if we
like say that the ratification is an expression of Great Britain's
will to become bound by the treaty. This language, however
alluring and figurative, merely describes a situation of fact,
that the competent British executive organ has ratified a treaty,
and that the British people through their representatives have
become responsible for the fulfilment of treaty obligations.
The State-will is thus a mere _façon de parler_, as the only will
or wills which operate are those of the individuals who govern
Great Britain.

(2) It is difficult to reconcile the facts with a consensual
theory of international law. In the case of customary rules,
there are many instances where it is quite impossible to find
any consent by States to the binding effect of these rules.
Moreover, the consensual theory breaks down in the crucial
case of a new State admitted into the family of nations, as, for
example, those African States, emerged since 1957 by way of
"decolonisation". Such a new State is bound by international
law from the date of its emancipation without an express act of
consent. The idea that in such an instance there is a "tacit"
or "implied" consent, merely strains the facts. The reality is
that other States look to the new State to comply with the
whole body of established international law. This has consistently
been the attitude of two influential Great Powers---the
United States of America and Great Britain. As to the
United States, the authoritative Moore's _Digest of International
Law_[^27/1] says :---

>The Government of the United States has on various
occasions announced the principle that international law, as
a system, is binding upon nations, not merely as something
to which they may be tacitly assumed to have agreed, but also
as a fundamental condition of their admission to full and
equal participation in the intercourse of civilised States.

Professor H. A. Smith on an examination of British official
legal opinions and State papers relative to questions of international
law declared that therein[^27/2] :---

> ... It is clearly emphasised that international law as a
whole is binding upon all civilised States irrespective of their
individual consent, and that no State can by its own act release
itself from the obligation either of the general law or of any
well established rule.

(3) It is never necessary in practice when invoking a particular
rule of international law against a particular State to
show that that State has assented to it diplomatically. The
test applied is whether the rule is one generally recognised by
the society of States. As Westlake[^28/1] has put it :---

> It is enough to show that the general _consensus_ of opinion
within the limits of European civilisation is in favour of the
rule.

(4) There are concrete examples today of treaty rules, particularly
those laid down by "law-making" treaties, having an
incidence upon States without any form of consent expressed
by or attributable to them. A striking example is paragraph 6
of Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which provides that
the United Nations is to ensure that non-Member States shall
act in accordance with the principles of the Charter so far as
may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace
and security.

These objections to positivism are by no means exhaustive,
but they sufficiently illustrate the main defect of the theory---
the fallacy of the premise that some consensual manifestation is
necessary before international law can operate.

In spite of its many weaknesses, positivist theory has had one
valuable influence on the science of international law. It has
concentrated attention on the actual practice of States by
emphasising, perhaps unduly, that only those rules which
States do in fact observe can be rules of international law.
This has led to a more realistic outlook in works on international
law, and to the elimination of much that was academic,
sterile, and doctrinal.

### Sanctions of Observance of International Law

A controversial question is the extent to which sanctions,
including sanctions by way of external force, are available
under international law, to secure observance of its rules.
At one extreme there is the view that international law is a
system without sanctions. However, it is not quite true that
there are no forcible means of compelling a State to comply
with international law. The United Nations Security Council
may, pursuant to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter
of June 26, 1945, in the event of a threat to the peace, breach
of the peace, or act of aggression, institute enforcement action
against a particular State to maintain or restore international
peace and security, and to the extent that the State concerned
is in breach of international law, this is in effect a form of
collective sanction to enforce international law. Also, under
Article 94 paragraph 2 of the Charter, if any State, party to
a case before the International Court of Justice, fails to perform
the obligations incumbent upon it under a judgment rendered
by the Court, the Security Council may upon application by
the other State, party to the same case, make recommendations
or decide upon measures to be taken to give effect to the judgment.
It must be acknowledged, however, that the United
Nations Charter does not otherwise allow the use of force,
collectively or individually, for the enforcement of international
law in general.[^29/1] Under Article 2 paragraph 4 of
the Charter, Member States are to refrain from the threat or
use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence
of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent
with the Purposes of the United Nations. The right of self-defence
permitted to Member States by Article 51 of the
Charter is only against an actual armed attack. These provisions
have restricted the liberty formerly enjoyed by States
to use forcible measures, short of war, such as retorsion and
reprisals (_see_ Chapter 16, _post._), or to go further and resort
to war in order to induce other States to fulfil their international
obligations. Historically, war used to be, in a sense, the
ultimate sanction by which international law was enforced,
but upon its strict interpretation the Charter prohibits the
unilateral application, without the authority or licence of the
Security Council, of sanctions to enforce international law,
and permits only sanctions, of the nature of enforcement or
preventative action, duly authorised by the Security Council,
in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.
These may include, not only the actual use of force, but also
economic sanctions (e.g., the imposition of a collective embargo
upon trade with a particular State or entity), as has already
occurred in the case of South Africa[^30/1] and of Rhodesia.[^30/2] Moreover,
since the critical point is the need for the Security Council's
authority, it is _semble_ not required that force be applied collectively
by a number of States, for a single individual member
of the United Nations may be authorised to take unilateral
forcible action, as occurred in 1966 when the United Kingdom
was so authorised, for the purpose of preventing the transport
of oil to Rhodesia.[^30/3]

If the word "sanctions" be taken in the larger sense of
measures, procedures, and expedients for exerting pressure
upon a State to comply with its international legal obligations,
then the above-mentioned provisions of the United Nations
Charter are not exhaustive of the sanctions which may become
operative in different areas of international law. By way of
illustration, reference may be made to the following instances :

(a) Under the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation
(_see_ Articles 24--34), a procedure is laid down for dealing
with complaints regarding a failure by a Member State to
secure the effective observance of an International Labour
Convention binding it; this can lead to a reference to a Commission
of Enquiry, or if necessary to the International Court
of Justice, and in the event of a Member State failing to carry
out the recommendations in the Commission's report or in the
decision of the International Court of Justice, the Governing
Body of the Organisation may recommend "action" to the
International Labour Conference in order to secure compliance
with the recommendations.[^31/1]

(b) Under the Single Convention
on Narcotic Drugs of March 30, 1961 (_see_ Article 14), if any
country or territory fails to carry out the provisions of the
Convention, the aim of which is to limit the quantity of narcotic
drugs in use to the amount needed for legitimate purposes,
a body known as the International Narcotics Control Board is
entitled to call for explanations from the country or territory;
should the explanations be unsatisfactory, the Board may call
the attention of other competent United Nations organs to the
position, and may go to the length of recommending a stoppage
of drug imports or exports or both to and from the country or
territory in default.

(c) The constituent instruments of certain
international organisations provide that Member States not
complying with the basic principles laid down in these instruments
may be suspended or expelled (_see_, e.g., Article 6 of the
United Nations Charter).

(d) An international legal obligation
is sometimes enforceable through the procedures of domestic
legal systems, subject to the appropriate sanctions applying
under these systems; for example, under Articles 54--55 of
the Convention of 1965 on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, each
contracting State is to recognise an arbitral award made
pursuant to the Convention as binding, and is to enforce the
pecuniary obligations imposed by the award as if it were a
final judgment of a court in that State.

(e) Acts by a particular
State, in breach of international law, may sometimes be treated
by other States as invalid and inoperative. In its Advisory
Opinion of June 21, 1971, on the _Legal Consequences for
States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia
(South West Africa)_, the International Court of Justice ruled
that South Africa's continued presence in Namibia (South
West Africa) was illegal, and that Member States of the United
Nations were obliged to recognise the invalidity of South
Africa's acts as to Namibia, and to refrain from acts and
dealings with South Africa implying acceptance of the legality
of its presence in, and administration of Namibia, or lending
support or assistance to these.[^32/1]

Notwithstanding the sanctions possible under the United
Nations Charter, together with the range of pressures which
may be applied to compel a State to comply with international
law, it still remains true that the international community
does not have available to it a permanent organised force for
securing obedience to the law, similar to that which exists in
a modern State. The question then is whether this complete
absence of an organised external force necessarily derogates
from the legal character of international law. In this connection,
there is a helpful comparison to be made between international
law and the canon law, the law of the Catholic Church.
The comparison is the more striking in the early history of the
law of nations when the binding force of both systems was
founded to some extent upon the concept of the "law of
nature". The canon law is like international law unsupported
by organised external force, although there are certain punishments
for breach of its rules, for example, excommunication
and the refusal of sacraments. But generally the canon law is
obeyed because as a practical matter, the Catholic society is
agreeable to abide by its rules. This indicates that international
law is not exceptional in its lack of organised external force.

Nor should it be forgotten that there are tangible sanctions for
those rules of international law, at least, which impose duties
upon individuals. For example, persons who, contrary to
international law, commit war crimes, are no less subject to
punishment than those who are guilty of criminal offences under
municipal law. Another illustration is that of the international
law crime of piracy _jure gentium_; every State is entitled to
apprehend, try, and punish (if convicted) persons guilty of this
crime (_see_ Geneva Convention on the High Seas of April
29, 1958, Articles 19 and 21, and Chapter 8, _post._). Similarly,
under the Hague Convention of December 16, 1970 for the
Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, hijacking and
like acts endangering the safety of aircraft, and persons and
property on aircraft, are made punishable by contracting
States who are entitled to place offenders in custody and take
other appropriate measures.[^33/1]

It is clear from the above analysis of theories as to the basis
of international law, that a complete explanation of its binding
force, embracing all cases and conditions, is hardly practicable.
Indeed, there is something pedantic in the very notion that
such a comprehensive explanation is necessary or desirable.

Apart from the sanctions and pressures mentioned above,
one of the main elements reinforcing the obligatory character
of the rules of international law is the empirical fact that States
will insist on their rights under such rules against States
which they consider should observe them. Obviously, if
States did not insist on respect for these rules, international law
would not exist. The ultimate reasons that impel States to
uphold the observance of international law belong to the
domain of political science, and cannot be explained by a
strictly legal analysis. In other words, to some extent at least,
the problem of the binding force of international law ultimately
resolves itself into a problem no different from that of the
obligatory character of law in general.

under international law is responsible therefor and liable to punishment."

[^2/4]: There is a division of opinion among writers whether international law
includes the "internal" law of international institutions, such as the rules
governing the rights and duties of officials of these institutions. For the view
that the expression "international law" in Article 38 of the Statute of the
International Court of Justice does not cover this "internal" law, _see_ per
Judge Córdova I.C.J. Reports, 1956, at pp. 165--166.

[^3/1]: "International law" is the title most frequently adopted by English and
American jurists (_cf._ the treatises of Hall, Westlake, Oppenheim, Kent,
Wheaton, Hyde, and Fenwick). Twiss, and Lorimer elected to use the title
"law of nations", while Hannis Taylor and A. S. Hershey preferred "international
public law". Other suggested titles have been "the law between
Powers" (e.g., by Taube), "inter-State law", and "the law of the community
of States" (e.g., by Verdross). Judge Jessup in his Transitional Law (1956),
adopted this latter title to denote "all law which regulates actions or events
that transcend national boundaries".

[^4/1]: There are besides the several references to "justice" in the Charter of
the United Nations signed at San Francisco on June 26, 1945; _see_ e.g., the
Preamble, Article 1, paragraph 1, Article 2, paragraph 3, and Article 76.
Humanitarian considerations are not in themselves sufficient to generate
international legal rights and obligations: _South West Africa Cases, 2nd Phase_,

in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in the Eastern Empire and in Italy,
while the Sovereigns of medieval England observed certain rules and usages
in their relations with foreign Sovereigns.

Mediterranean countries and apparently collected in Spain in the fourteenth
century.

[^9/2]: Of particular importance was the contribution of the so-called "school"
of Spanish writers, including Suarez and Ayala, mentioned above. In their
works one finds powerfully expressed the concepts of the universal validity of
a law of nations, and of the subjection of all States to a higher law, which
influenced jurists in succeeding centuries. The influence of scholars and
writers in Eastern Europe such as Paulus Vladimiri (1371--1435) of the University
of Cracow, should also not be overlooked. For discussion of the
writings of Vittoria and Suarez, _see_ Bernice Hamilton, Political Thought in
Sixteenth Century Spain (1963).

International Law Commission, which has a standing invitation to send an
observer. For the impact upon international law of the new Asian and other
States, _see_ Syatauw, Some Newly Established Asian States and the Development
of International Law (1961), and S. P. Sinha, New Nations and the Law of

fifteen members, appointed in their individual capacity as experts, first met in
1949. Subjects dealt with by the Commission since 1949 have included the
basic rights and duties of States, offences against the peace and security of
mankind (the Nuremberg principles), reservations to treaties, the regime of the
high seas, the law of treaties, arbitral procedure, nationality, statelessness, international
criminal jurisdiction, the definition of aggression, State responsibility,
diplomatic and consular practice, succession of States and Governments, and
relations between States and inter-governmental organisations. The Commission
now consists of twenty-five members.

[^19/1]: Indeed a significant number of customary rules of international law have
now been formulated as rules in multilateral Conventions; as, e.g., in the
case of the four Geneva Conventions of April 28--29, 1958, on the Law of the
Sea, and the three Vienna Conventions of April 18, 1961, on Diplomatic
Relations, of April 24, 1963, on Consular Relations, and of May 22, 1969,
on the Law of Treaties, codifying the customary rules as to diplomatic and
consular privileges and immunities, and as to the law and practice of treaties.

[^20/3]: An illustration of such a usage of courtesy was the privilege accorded,
within certain limits, to diplomatic envoys to import, free of customs dues,
goods intended for their own private use. This courtesy privilege has now
become a matter of legal duty upon the State of accreditation under Article
36(1)(b) of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of April 18, 1961.

[^21/1]: In this connection, reference should be made to judicial "comity". For
example, British Courts apply "comity" when giving recognition to the
legislative, executive, and judicial acts of other States. _See_ Foster v. Driscoll,
[1929] 1 K.B. 470. "Comity", in its general sense, cannot be invoked to
prevent Great Britain, as a sovereign State, from taking steps to protect its
own revenue laws from gross abuse; _see_ decision of House of Lords in Collco
Dealings, Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, [1962] A.C. 1 at 19; (1961)
1 All E.R. 762 at 765.

[^22/1]: _See_ pp. 59--61, _post._

[^22/2]: The concept of a "law of nature" goes back to the Greeks, and its history
can be traced through the Roman jurists up to medieval times when it found
expression in the philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas (1226--1274). _See_ Barker,
Introduction to Gierke, Natural Law and the Theory of Society: (transl. 1934),
Vol. I, xxxiv-xliii.

[^22/3]: Preliminaries. §7.

[^23/1]: The United Nations General Assembly, on December 17, 1966, unanimously
approved a Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and
a Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The two Covenants were opened
for signature on December 19, 1966.

[^24/1]: This is the more specialised meaning of the term "positivist". In its
broader sense, the term "positivist" denotes a writer, such as Bynkershoek
and others, who maintains that the practice of States (custom and treaties)
constitutes the primary source of international law. Also, some "positivists"
held that the only true law,"positive" law, must be the result of some externally
recognisable procedure; _see_ Ago, Positive Law and International
Law", _American Journal of International Law_ (1957), Vol. 51, pp. 691--733.

[^25/1]: The "auto-limitation" theory was adopted by Jellinek in his work,
Die rechtliche Natur der Staatenverträge (1880).

[^25/2]: Another refinement of positivist theory is Triepel's view that the obligatory
force of international law stems from the Vereinbarung, or agreement of
States to become bound by common consent; this agreement is an expression
of a "common will" of States, and States cannot unilaterally withdraw
consent.

[^25/3]: This view has also been adopted by Soviet Russian jurists; _see_ Professor
G. I. Tunkin's, _Droit International Public: Problèmes Théoriques_ (Paris, 1965

[^29/1]: _See_ Kunz, "Sanctions in International Law", _American Journal of International
Law_ (1960), Vol. 54, pp. 324--347. United Nations "peacekeeping"
operations cannot, strictly speaking, be regarded as a category of sanctions
for the observance of international law, although sometimes serving to prevent
the occurrence of breaches of international law. The primary purpose of
United Nations peacekeeping forces or peacekeeping missions is to restore or
maintain peace, or to mitigate deteriorating situations; _see_ pp. 620--621, _post._

[^30/1]: _See_ the Resolutions of the Security Council of August 7, 1963, and
June 18, 1964, calling upon all States to cease the sale and shipment to South
Africa of arms, ammunition of all types, and military vehicles.

[^30/2]: _See_ the Resolution of the Security Council of November 20, 1965, calling
upon all States to do their utmost in order to cease all economic relations with
Rhodesia, such cessation to include an embargo on oil and petroleum products.

[^30/3]: _See_ the Resolution of the Security Council of April 9, 1966, empowering
the United Kingdom to take steps, by the use of force if necessary, to prevent
ships taking oil to ports from which it could be supplied or distributed to
Rhodesia.
