5.--NEW TERRITORIAL TITLES, TERRITORIAL
CHANGES, AND TREATIES; NON-RECOGNITION
Often States acquire new territorial or other rights by
unilateral act on their part which may be:---

(a) according to
international law, or (b) in violation of international law. In
case (b), recognition may be sought in order to turn a doubtful
title into a good one and because the recognition will amount
to a waiver by the other States of claims or objections incon-
sistent with the title thus recognised. In this way, the possi-
bility that non-recognition may defeat a claim based upon
acquiescence or prescription is excluded. The continuance
of formal relations with the State concerned, after such terri-
torial acquisition, does not of itself imply the recognition of
the new territorial title.
In January, 1932, there was enunciated by Mr. Stimson,
United States Secretary of State, a doctrine of non-recognition,
which has since become widely known as the Stimson Doctrine of
Non-Recognition. This declaration of policy was due to events
in the Far East. In 1931, Japan, then a member of the League
of Nations, invaded Manchuria, which was legally under the
sovereignty of China. Subsequently, the Japanese forces
overran and conquered Southern Manchuria. The United
States refused to recognise this new situation or any treaties
with China legalising it, and to clarify this attitude, Mr.
Stimson, in a communication to the Chinese and Japanese
Governments, announced that:---

" The United States cannot admit the legality of any situation
_de facto_ nor does it intend to recognise any treaty or agreement
between those Governments, or agents thereof, which may
impair the treaty rights of the United States ... and that it
does not intend to recognise any situation, treaty or agreement
which may be brought about by means contrary to the covenants
and obligations of the Treaty of Paris of August 27, 1928".
The Treaty of Paris referred to in Mr. Stimson's communica-
tion was the General Treaty of 1928 for the Renunciation of
War (known as the Briand-Kellogg Pact); this had been signed
by the United States, as well as by China and Japan. Mr.
Stimson claimed that by the doctrine a caveat would "be

placed upon such actions which, we believe, will effectively bar
the legality hereafter of any title or right sought to be obtained
by pressure of treaty violation ".
The Stimson doctrine of non-recognition was explicitly
a statement of United States national policy, although at the
same time it was, according to Professor Briggs,2 "in part, an
attempt to establish the invalidity of treaties obtained through
employment of duress in the wider sense of coercion against
a State". The Stimson declaration was followed some two
months later by a Resolution adopted by the League of Nations
Assembly on March 11, 1932, formulating a duty of non-
recognition in these terms:---
-
" It is incumbent upon the Members of the League of Nations
not to recognise any situation, treaty, or agreement which may
be brought about by means contrary to the Covenant of the
League of Nations or to the Pact of Paris."
In the events which happened during the period 1932--1940,
both the Stimson doctrine and the Assembly Resolution proved
ineffectual, although towards the end of, and after the Second
World War, the principle which they sought to uphold was to
some extent vindicated by the restoration to certain States of
the territory which had previously been taken from them by
force.
Since the adoption of the United Nations Charter in 1945,
followed by the establishment of the United Nations as a
working body, there has been a discernible trend towards a
doctrine of the non-recognition of territorial changes and
treaties that have resulted from the threat or use of force against
the territorial integrity or political independence of any State,
or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the
United Nations. This is reflected in the following:---a) The

United Kingdom and the United States where, in respect to recognition
matters, a certificate or expression of opinion of the executive in an appropriate
case will bind domestic courts. _See_ pp. 161--163, _ante_.

United Nations Charter.

provision in the Bogotá Charter of the Organisation of American
States, April 30, 1948 (_see_ Article 17) that "no territorial
acquisition or special advantages obtained either by force or
by other means of coercion " are to be recognised. (b) Article
11 of the Draft Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States,
prepared by the International Law Commission in 1949, to
the effect that every State is under a duty to refrain from recog-
nising any territorial acquisition by another State obtained
through the threat or use of force against the territorial inte-
grity or political independence of another State, or " in any
other manner inconsistent with international law and order"
..

(c) Article 52 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
of May 22, 1969, providing that a Treaty is void if its conclusion
has been procured by the threat or use of force" in violation
of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter
of the United Nations ". (d) The Declaration on Principles
of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-
operation Among States in Accordance with the United Nations
Charter, adopted by the General Assembly in 1970, proclaiming
the following principle:---
" No territorial acquisition resulting
from the threat or use of force shall be recognised as legal ".
The question of obligatory non-recognition has arisen in
relation to the current situations respectively in South West
Africa (Namibia), where in spite of United Nations Resolutions
and rulings of the International Court of Justice to the contrary,
South Africa continues to purport to exercise authority as
mandatory, as if it were not subject to the supervision of United
Nations organs, and in Rhodesia, which is governed by a
régime resulting from the unilateral declaration of independence
of November 11, 1965. A Resolution adopted by the United
Nations General Assembly on October 27, 1966, declared that
South Africa had failed to fulfil its obligations as mandatory,
with the result that the mandate was terminated and South

ciliation of 1933, and the Lima Declaration of 1938 on Non-Recognition of the
Acquisition of Territory by Force.

West Africa came under the direct responsibility of the United
Nations, thus carrying the implication that Member States
were bound to recognise this position, and not to recognise
the continuance of South Africa's status as a mandatory.
Similarly, a Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on
November 17, 1966, which, inter alia, condemned Portugal and
South Africa for supporting the Rhodesian régime, and called
upon the United Kingdom Government to take all necessary
measures to put an end to that régime, involved the implication
that Member States were under a duty not to recognise the
régime. In a Resolution adopted on November 17, 1970, the
Security Council urged States not to recognise the régime.
In its Advisory Opinion of June 21, 1971, on the Legal
Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South
Africa in South West Africa (Namibia), the International
Court of Justice ruled:---

(1) that inasmuch as the continued
presence of South Africa in Namibia was illegal by reason of
its refusal to submit to the supervision of United Nations
organs, South Africa was under an obligation to withdraw its
administration from the Territory immediately, and to end
its occupation there; and (2) that Member States of the United
Nations were under an obligation not to recognise the legality
of South Africa's presence in Namibia, or the validity of South
Africa's acts on behalf of or concerning Namibia, and were
to refrain from any acts and any dealings with the South
African Government implying recognition of the legality of, or
lending support or assistance to, such presence and adminis-
tration. Moreover, the validity or effects of any relations
entered into by any State with South Africa concerning Namibia
ought not to be recognised by the United Nations or its Member
States. Although the Advisory Opinion is confined to rulings
upon the particular circumstances of South Africa's relationship
to Namibia, these pronouncements may well be used in the
future for wider purposes to support a generalised rule imposing
a duty of non-recognition of all territorial and other situations
brought about in breach of international law.
