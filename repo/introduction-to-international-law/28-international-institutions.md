CHAPTER 19
INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
1.-THEIR STATUS AND FUNCTIONS AS SUBJECTS OF
INTERNATIONAL LAW
As we have seen in a previous chapter, the subjects of inter-
national law include not only States, but international
institutions such as the United Nations, the International
Labour Organisation and similar bodies. The word " institu-
tion" is here used in its widest sense as nomen generalissimum
for the multiplicity of creations for associating States in
common enterprises.
Although strictly speaking the structure and working of
these bodies and associations are primarily the concern of that
department of political science known as international organisa-
tion or administration, their activities none the less materially
impinge upon the field of international law. It is important
to _see_ in what way they come within the range of international
law or contribute towards its development.
In the first place, just as the functions of the modern State
and the rights, duties, and powers of its instrumentalities are
governed by a branch of municipal law called State con-
1 _See_ Chapter 3, above, at pp. 70--71.
2 The expansion in number, and range of duties of international organisa-
tions has been enormous since 1900. By 1950, there were, according to a
United States official publication, International Organisations in which the
United States Participates (1950), over 200 international bodies, of which
about 60 could be described as major international institutions. Since 1950,
the number has materially increased, and must continue to increase. _See also_
Treaties in Force. A List of Treaties, etc., of the United States in Force on
January 1, 1970 (Department of State, 1970), pp. 259--374, showing the
constituent instruments of the major international organisations to which the
United States Government is currently a party; this list affords some idea of
the wide span of functions discharged by these bodies.

stitutional law, so international institutions are similarly
conditioned by a body of rules that may well be described as inter-
national constitutional law. These international bodies having
important duties to perform on behalf of the international
community, whether of a world-wide or regional character,
provide that community with its constitutional framework.
This constitutional structure does not follow precisely the
same pattern as in the Constitutions of modern States, but
there are significant analogies. For instance international
institutions perform as organs of the international society a
large number of functions which can be classified as executive,
legislative, and judicial in the same manner as the functions of
modern States. As to international executive functions, it is
true that there is no central executive organ with the same
degree of authority over the international community as any
Government wields over a modern State, but the admin-
istrative powers that would have been vested in such a central
international body if it had existed, are possessed cumulatively
by and distributed over a number of international institutions,
each with separate and different responsibilities; for example,
the executive function of enforcing world peace belongs to the
United Nations, the supervision of world labour conditions is
a special power of the International Labour Organisation
(ILO), and the improvement of world education and learning
is a particular duty of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). If these individual
responsibilities were discharged in toto by one instead of by
several international bodies, the world would possess the
organic counterpart of the executive in a modern State.
With regard to international legislative functions these are
performed on a limited scale by several organs, including the
United Nations General Assembly, the International Labour
Conference, and the World Health Assembly. To a similarly
restricted extent, international judicial functions are vested in
the International Court of Justice, and can be vested in other
international tribunals.
However, there is no such thing as a separation of powers
under the Constitutions of most international institutions,

------
Chap. 19.--International Institutions
563
which may, through their organs, exercise legislative or judicial,
or quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers, in the same way
as they carry out administrative or executive functions. Nor
are certain international institutions executive organs in the
strict sense, being merely consultative and advisory only.
Varied indeed may be the legal structure of these organisa-
tions; true corporate entities, collectivities of States function-
ing through organs taking decisions, 2 and loose associations
meeting only in periodical conferences, sometimes largely
hingeing on an element of continuity represented by a secre-
tariat or secretarial Bureau.3
Besides, there are three important general points to be
noted :---

(1) The functions of certain international institutions
may be directed primarily to inspiring co-operation between
States, i.e., so-called "promotional " activities, and only in a
secondary degree to the carrying out directly of any necessary
duties, i.e., so-called " operational" activities. Thus the Food
and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)
and the World Health Organisation (WHO) are much more
"promotional" than " operational " bodies. (2) Even so far
as they are "operational ", international institutions are as a
rule empowered only to investigate or recommend, rather than
to make binding decisions. (3) In most instances, international
institutions are but little removed from an international
conference, in the sense that any corporate or organic decision
depends ultimately on a majority decision of the Member
States, i.e., the agreement of the corporators. Most inter-
national institutions are keyed not so much to the taking of
1 For instance, the Commission of the European Economic Community
(Common Market) under the Treaty of Rome of March 25, 1957, establishing
the Community, exercises at the same time, regulatory, quasi-judicial, and
administrative powers.

1966, 6, at p. 30.
E.g., the Hague Conference on Private International Law.
4 It is a question of construction of the relevant instruments or treaties
whether the corporators (i.e., the member States) are entitled to exercise any
powers appertaining to the institution, or whether this is a matter of organic
or institutional action only; South West Africa Cases, 2nd Phase, I.C.J. Reports,
1966, 6, at p. 29.

binding executive decisions, as to the making of non-mandatory
recommendations for the guidance of their organs, and of their
member States.
Apart from the law and practice (based on their Constitutions
and on general principles of international law) of such bodies,
there is another direction in which international institutions
may influence the development of international law. In the
past, when States were almost exclusively the subjects of the
law of nations, the traditional body of international law
developed through custom, treaty, and arbitral decisions as the
product of the relations of States _inter se_. But international
institutions, as subjects of international law, can have relations
not only between themselves, but also with other subjects,
including States, so that in addition to the relations between
States, we have the two following kinds of relations that can
lead to the formation of new rules of international law:---


(1) relations between States and international institutions; and

(2) relations between international institutions themselves.
Already there have been significant instances of rules evolving
from these two relations. As to (1), relations between States
and international institutions, in 1948, for example, there arose
the question whether in respect of injuries suffered by its agents
in Palestine (including the assassination of Count Folke
Bernadotte, United Nations Mediator), the United Nations
could claim compensation as against a _de jure_ or _de facto_
Government, even if not a Government of a Member State of
the organisation, for the damage to itself through such injuries.
Pursuant to a request for an advisory opinion on this point,
the International Court of Justice decided in 1949 that the
United Nations as an international institution was entitled to
bring such a claim. With regard to (2), relations of inter-
national institutions _inter se_, the practice of these bodies in
concluding agreements with each other is materially affecting
the rules of law and procedure concerning international
transactions.
· _See_ Advisory opinion on Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the Service of
the United Nations, I.C.J. Reports (1949), 174.

------
Chap. 19.--- International Institutions
565
That is quite apart, too, from the relations between inter-
national institutions and individuals, which, as in the case of
relations between States and individuals, already foreshadow
the growth of important new principles of international law.
An illustration is to be found in the Advisory Opinion, just
mentioned, of the International Court of Justice, where the
Court had to consider whether the United Nations, in addition
to suing for compensation for the damage to itself through
injuries suffered by its agents, could also recover damages for
the actual loss or harm caused to such agents, or to the persons
(for example, relatives) entitled through them to compensation.
In effect, the question was whether the United Nations could
espouse the claims of its agents in the same way as States, under
the rules of State responsibility for international delinquencies,
can sponsor claims by their nationals. This involved recon-
ciling the dual position of agents of the United Nations, as
servants on the one hand of the Organisation, and as nationals
on the other hand entitled to the diplomatic protection of their
own States. The solution adopted by the majority of the Court
was that the United Nations was entitled to bring such a
claim, inasmuch as its right to do so was founded on the
official status of its agents irrespective of their nationality, and
was therefore not inconsistent with the agents' privilege of
receiving diplomatic protection from their own States.1
One general consideration needs to be stressed. The true
nature and purpose of present-day international institutions
cannot be understood unless we realise that these bodies
represent one kind of instrumentality whereby States are
associated in a common purpose of improving human welfare.?
Finally reference should be made to the regional inter-
national institutions, the purposes of which are largely inte-
grative and functional, such as the European Economic Com-
munity (EEC, the Common Market). These would require
a study in themselves, to such an extent do they constitute
11.C.J. Reports (1949), at pp. 184--186.
* Indeed, the whole field of action of international institutions has become
  dominated in the last decade by the aspect of aid and technical assistance to
  less-developed countries.

novel precedents in the law of international organisations.
Nor are they necessarily limited in their scope to the region
or community which is being integrated; their ramifications
may extend further through "association " Conventions, as,
e.g., the Yaoundé Convention, July 20, 1963, associating the
EEC with certain African States.

2.-GENERAL LEGAL NATURE AND CONSTITUTIONAL
STRUCTURE
Functions and Legal Capacity
International institutions are defined by reference to their
legal functions and responsibilities, each such institution having
its own limited field of activity. The Constitutions of these
bodies usually set out their purposes, objects, and powers in
special clauses. For example, Article 1 of the United Nations
Charter (signed June 26, 1945) defines the Purposes
the United Nations under four heads, of which two in par-
ticular are the maintenance of international peace and security,
and the development of friendly relations among nations
based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-
determination of peoples. Similarly the Constitutions of other
international bodies, for example, of the International Labour
Organisation (_see_ Preamble and Article 1 referring to the
" objects" of the Organisation), and of the Food and Agri-
culture Organisation of the United Nations (_see_ Preamble and
Article 1 referring to the Organisation's " Functions "), contain
provisions defining their special objects and responsibilities.
The definition in each Constitution of the international
body's particular field of activity is analogous to the " objects ?
clause in the memorandum of association of a limited company
under British Companies legislation. In both cases, the
corporate powers of the international institution on the one
hand and of the limited company on the other, are determined
by the statement of functions or objects. The analogy can be
carried further inasmuch as the recent practice in the Con-
stitutions of international organs of defining the " objects " in
as general and comprehensive a manner as possible resembles
> >

------
Chap. 19.--- International Institutions
567
the present-day methods of company lawyers in drafting
" objects " clauses in very wide terms to preclude any doubts
later arising as to the legal capacity of the company concerned.
As international institutions are defined and limited by their
constitutional powers, they differ basically from States as
subjects of international law. In their case, problems such as
those raised by the sovereignty or jurisdiction of States cannot
arise, or at least cannot arise in the same way. Almost every
activity is _prima facie_ within the competence of a State under
international law, whereas practically the opposite principle
applies to an international organ, namely, that any function,
not within the express terms of its Constitution, is _prima facie_
outside its powers. As the International Court of Justice has
said referring to the United Nations?:---

" Whereas a State possesses the totality of international
rights and duties recognised by international law, the rights and
duties of an entity such as the Organisation must depend upon
its purposes and functions as specified or implied in its
constituent documents and developed in practice ".
Thus no international body can legally overstep its constitu-
tional powers.
For example, the International Labour
Organisation cannot constitutionally purport to exercise the
peace enforcement functions of the United Nations Security
Council, and order (say) a cease-fire in the event of hostilities
between certain States.
Besides its express powers, an international organ may have
under its Constitution such functions as "are conferred upon
it by necessary implication as being essential to the performance
of its duties".? Thus in the Advisory Opinion mentioned
above, the majority of the International Court of Justice held
that by implication from its Charter, the United Nations had
the power of exercising diplomatic protection over its agents,
and could therefore sponsor claims on behalf of such agents
against Governments for injuries received in the course of
11.C.J. Reports (1949), at p. 180.

point.

their official duties. In a later Advisory Opinion, the Court
held that the United Nations General Assembly had implied
power to create a judicial or administrative tribunal, which
might give judgments binding the General Assembly itself.
In relation to the corporate nature of international bodies,
the question arises whether they possess legal personality:---


(a) at international law; and (b) at municipal law.
In the case of the League of Nations, although the Covenant
did not expressly confer juridical personality, the general view
was that the League had both international and municipal legal
personality. This was based partly on the principle that such
personality was implicitly necessary for the efficient per-
formance by the League of its functions, and partly on its
practice in repeatedly acting as a corporate person, for example
concluding agreements with the Swiss Government, taking
over property and funds, etc.
The Constitution of the League's present successor---the
United Nations likewise contained no express provision as
to legal personality, the draftsmen assuming that this was
more or less implicit from the context of the Charter taken as
a whole. It was however provided in Article 104 of the
Charter that the United Nations should enjoy in the territory
of each of its Members" such legal capacity as may be necessary
for the exercise of its functions and the fulfilment of its
purposes ". Subsequently in February, 1946, the United
Nations General Assembly approved a Convention on the
Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations which by
Article 1 provided that the United Nations should possess
"juridical personality" and have the capacity to contract, to
1 _See_ Advisory Opinion on Effect of Awards made by the United Nations
Administrative Tribunal, I.C.J. Reports (1954), 47. The United Nations has,
_semble_, also implied power:---

(1) To undertake the temporary administration
of territory, as part of a peaceful settlement of a dispute between two States,
and with their consent; _cf._ the assumption of temporary administration of
West New Guinea 1962--1963 by the United Nations Temporary Executive
Authority (UNTEA) under the Indonesia-Netherlands Agreement of
August 15, 1962. (2) To borrow money by way of bonds or other securities
for its purposes under the Charter; _cf._ the General Assembly Resolution of
December 20, 1961, authorising the issue of United Nations bonds to a total of
200 million dollars.

acquire and dispose of immovable and movable property, and
to institute legal proceedings. The Convention was followed
by legislation in several States, but according to the municipal
law of certain countries, 1 under the Convention in conjunction
with Article 104 of the Charter, the United Nations would
probably be regarded as having legal personality even without
such legislation. In this way, the municipal legal personality
of the United Nations may be considered well-established.
As to the organisation's international legal personality, the
International Court of Justice in its Advisory Opinion men-
tioned above, on the right of the United Nations to claim
compensation for injuries to its agents, decided that the United
Nations is an international legal person, having such status even
in its relations with non-Member States.2
Apart from the United Nations Charter, the Constitutions
of other international institutions, both general and regional,3
contain provisions similar to Article 104 of the Charter or to
Article 1 of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities
of the United Nations (_see_, for example, Article 39 of the Con-
stitution of the International Labour Organisation, Article XV

(1) of the Constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organisa-
tion of the United Nations, and Article IV (1) of the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund). In accor-
dance with the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of
Justice, mentioned above, the majority of these institutions
would be deemed to possess international legal personality.
As to municipal legal personality, however, the various pro-
visions in their Constitutions reflect no coherent doctrine as to
how such personality is to be recognised at municipal law.
For instance, Article 47 of the International Civil Aviation
Convention of 1944, dealing with the legal capacity of the

  _See_, as to the European Economic Community (Common Market)
  Articles 210--211 of the Treaty of Rome of March 25, 1957, establishing the
  Community.

570
Part 6.-International Institutions
International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) provides
that: -
"The Organisation shall enjoy in the territory of each con-
tracting State such legal capacity as may be necessary for the
performance of its functions. Full juridical personality shall
be granted wherever compatible with the Constitution and
laws of the State concerned ".
This formula seems to leave States parties free to grant or
withhold the privilege of legal personality if their municipal
law so permits, whereas the corresponding provisions in most
other Constitutions of international bodies bind States members
fully to recognise such personality.
Classification
It is difficult to suggest a satisfactory classification of
international institutions.
Classification of such bodies according to functions, for
example as economic, political, social, etc., or even as judicial,
legislative, and administrative, leads to difficulty owing to the
overlapping of their responsibilities.
The possible distinction between :---

(a) global or world-wide
bodies, for example, the United Nations and the International
Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), and (b) regional bodies,
for example, the South Pacific Commission, and the Council of
Europe, will become less important in time, because of the
general tendency of global bodies to establish their own regional
organs or regional associations.
A suggested distinction is that of international institutions
into those which are _supra-national_ and those which are not.
A _supra-national_ body is generally considered to be one which
has power to take decisions, directly binding upon individuals,
institutions, and enterprises, as well as upon the Governments
of the States in which they are situated, and which they must
carry out notwithstanding the wishes of such Governments.
The European Coal and Steel Community, created by the
Treaty of April 18, 1951, is regarded as such a _supra-national_
body, inasmuch as it may exercise direct powers of this nature
in regard to coal, iron, and steel in the territories of its Member

------
Chap. 19.--International Institutions
571
States. So also is the European Economic Community
(Common Market), established by the Treaty of Rome of
March 25, 1957. International bodies, not of the _supra-
national_ type, can only act, or execute decisions by or through
Member States. The defect in this classification resides in the
fact that the word "_supra-national_" is one which lends itself
so easily to misunderstandings.
Then there is also the special category of international public
corporations, controlled by Governments, as shareholders, or
otherwise. These differ from the usual type of international
organisations insofar as they are corporations governed by the
municipal law of the place where their headquarters are situated,
as well as by the Conventions establishing them. An illustra-
tion is the European Company for the Chemical Processing of
Irradiated Fuels (EUROCHEMIC) established under the
Convention of December 20, 1957.
Co-ordination of International Institutions
The draftsmen both of the League of Nations Covenant and
of the United Nations Charter attempted to solve the problem
of integrating international institutions and co-ordinating their
working. Their purpose was a highly practical one, to ensure
that these bodies should function as an organic whole, instead
of as a group of dispersed and isolated agencies.
Under Article 24 of the Covenant, it was provided that there
should be placed under the direction of the League all inter-
national bureaux already established by general treaties,
provided that the parties to such treaties consented, as well as
all such international bureaux and all commissions for the
regulation of matters of international interest thereafter
constituted. These provisions, for various reasons, resulted in
only six international bodies, including the International Air
Navigation Commission and the International Hydrographic
Bureau being placed under the direction of the League. Of
course, apart from these six institutions, there was co-ordination
between the League of Nations and the International Labour
Organisation up to the date of the League's dissolution by

------
572
Part 6.- International Institutions
reason of the following:---


(i) organic connection, members
of the League for example being ipso facto members of the
International Labour Organisation; (ii) a common budget;

(iii) the vesting of certain functions of the International
Labour Organisation in the Secretary-General of the League,
for example custody of the original texts of International
Labour Conventions; and (iv) actual co-operation between
the two bodies in investigating certain economic and social
problems.
More concrete and detailed provisions for the co-ordination
of international bodies were included in the United Nations
Charter. Their effect may be summarised as follows:---


(a) The international institutions described as "the various
specialised agencies, established by intergovernmental agree-
ment and having wide international responsibilities, as defined
in their basic instruments, in economic, social, cultural,
educational, health and related fields ", were to be brought
into relationship with the United Nations through agreements
entered into between these institutions and the United Nations
Economic and Social Council, such agreements to be approved
by the United Nations General Assembly and by each such
institution (Articles 57 and 63, paragraph 1, of the Charter).

(b) The United Nations Economic and Social Council was
empowered to co-ordinate the activities of the international
institutions entering into such agreements through consultation
with and recommendations made to them, and through
recommendations made to the General Assembly and Member
States of the United Nations (Article 63, paragraph 2).

(c) The United Nations, through its organs, was to make
further recommendations for co-ordinating the policies and
activities of these institutions (Article 58). (d) Regular
reports and observations thereon were to be obtained from
these institutions through the Economic and Social Council in
order mainly to ensure that they were giving effect to the
1 It should be noted that the language of Article 57 seems somewhat narrower
than the corresponding provisions of Article 24 of the League of Nations
Covenant, and does not cover all organs carrying on any kind of international
activity.

recommendations made to them (Article 64). (e) The
Economic and Social Council was empowered to arrange for
reciprocal representation between it and the specialised
agencies" at their respective meetings (Article 70).
Parallel provisions for co-ordination are also to be found in
the Constitutions of other international bodies, both of the
" specialised agencies" and of institutions not in this category,
including provisions for relationship with the United Nations,
for common personnel arrangements, and for common or
mutual representation.1
Through the application in practice of these provisions the
net of co-ordination has been cast not only wider, but deeper.
The "specialised agencies "---the name applied to the bodies
brought or to be brought into relationship with the United
Nations---have become for all practical purposes major opera-
ting arms of the United Nations, or to use a striking phrase in
one official report, its "specialised organisational tools".?
Further, through its Economic and Social Council, the
United Nations has been able to make continuous scrutiny of
the activities of the "specialised agencies" to ensure that
they function with some kind of organic unity.
Co-ordination and co-operation are also provided for by
inter-organisation agreements, consisting of:---

(1) Relationship
agreements between the United Nations and the special-
ised agencies under Articles 57 and 63 of the Charter.

(2) Agreements between the specialised agencies themselves.

(3) Agreements between a specialised agency and a regional
organisation (for example, that between the International
Labour Organisation and the Organisation of American
1 E.g., co-operative relations between the Organisation of American States
(OAS) and the United Nations are provided for in the Charter of the former,
and the Treaty of Rome of March 25, 1957, establishing the European
Economic Community (Common Market) provides that the Community may
conclude agreements with international organisations, creating an association
for joint action, etc. (_see_ Article 238).
Report of President of the United States to Congress on the United
Nations, 1948, p. 12. Although not a specialised agency, the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also been brought into working relation-
ship with the United Nations, and with specialised agencies having a par-
ticular interest in atomic energy, by special agreements with these institutions.

States). (4) Agreements between regional organisations.
Category (1) of the relationship agreements between the
United Nations and specialised agencies contain elaborate
provisions in a more or less common form for:---

(a) reciprocal
representation at their respective meetings; (b) enabling
United Nations organs and the specialised agencies to place
items on each other's agenda: (c) the reciprocal exchange of
information and documents; (d) uniformity of staff arrange-
ments under common methods and procedure; (e) considera-
tion by the specialised agencies of recommendations made to
them by the United Nations and for reports by them on the
action taken to give effect to these recommendations; 7) uni-
formity of financial and budget arrangements; (g) undertakings
by each specialised agency to assist the United Nations General
Assembly and Security Council in carrying out their decisions;
and (h) obtaining Advisory Opinions from the International
Court of Justice with regard to matters arising within the
scope of the activities of each specialised agency.1
It is true that besides the bodies with which the United
Nations has entered into relationship as specialised agencies,
there are numerous other international institutions that have
not been integrated into the one general system aimed at by
the Charter. Where the definition of specialised agencies in
Article 57 is wide enough to cover them, these outside inter-
national organs will no doubt in due course become the
subject of relationship agreements with the United Nations.2
1 From time to time, also, the United Nations General Assembly and the
Economic and Social Council have adopted resolutions designed to make co-
ordination more effective, emphasising the necessity of avoiding duplication of
effort, and calling for a greater concentration of effort on programmes de-
manding priority of effort, with particular reference, recently, to economic,
social, and human rights activities.
? International, regional, and national non-Governmental organisations,
also, may collaborate on a consultative basis with the Economic and Social
Council under Article 71 of the United Nations Charter. The Council has
granted to certain such bodies "consultative status" in categories I and II
respectively. Those of category I status may propose items for inclusion in
the provisional agenda of the Council and its commissions. The Council may,
besides, consult ad hoc with certain non-Governmental bodies, not enjoying
category I or category II status, but which are on the Council's Roster. All
such bodies may send observers to meetings, and may consult with the United
Nations Secretariat.

There is a committee of the Economic and Social Council known
as the Committee on Negotiations with Inter-Governmental
Agencies which, if necessary, can act upon the specific instruc-
tions of the Council, directing it to negotiate with specific
international organisations determined by the Counci).
The Economic and Social Council, with its Co-ordination
Committee, has a primary responsibility by consultation and
other action for maintaining co-ordination, particularly in the
economic, social, and human rights fields. But there is also a
special organ known as the Administrative Committee on
Co-ordination, which was established pursuant to a resolution
of the Council, composed of the Secretary-General of the
United Nations, the executive heads of the specialised agencies,
and the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), with the following duties, inter alia :---The
taking of appropriate measures to ensure the fullest and most
effective implementation of the agreements between the United
Nations and related agencies, the avoidance of duplication or
overlapping of their respective activities, ensuring consultation
on matters of common interest, the consideration of possibilities
of concerted action, and the solution of inter-agency problems.
The executive heads of the various programmes and separate
organisations within the United Nations system also participate
fully in the proceedings of the Administrative Committee on
Co-ordination. Within the framework of this Committee,
which is itself assisted by a Preparatory Committee, there are
also inter-agency consultative committees, such as the Con-
sultative Committee for Public Information, and technical
working groups on different aspects. Aided by these organs,
the specialised agencies have followed the general practice of co-
operating in common fields of activity. There is frequent
inter-agency consultation, particularly as most specialised
agencies have adopted rules providing for prior consultation
before taking action in matters of common concern to each other.
1 Other co-ordinating bodies are:---

(a) The Advisory Committee on
Administrative and Budgetary Questions appointed by the General Assembly.

(b) The Inter-Agency Consultative Board. (c) The International Civil Service
Advisory Board dealing with common administration policies. (d) The
Joint Panel of External Auditors.

The specialised agencies are entitled to attend meetings of the
Economic and Social Council and of its subsidiary organs, and
to make statements at such meetings.
On August 3, 1962, the Economic and Social Council set up a
Special Committee on Co-ordination with the following
principal duties:---

(a) to keep under review the activities of the
United Nations family in the economic, social, human rights,
and development fields, and to consider priority areas or
projects related to the objectives of the United Nations Develop-
ment Decade (for the period 1962--1972), and to submit recom-
mendations on these matters to the Council; (b) to study the
reports of the Administrative Committee on Co-ordination,
appropriate reports of the United Nations organs, the annual
reports of agencies in the United Nations family, and other
relevant documents, and to submit its conclusions to the
Council in the form of a concise statement of the issues and
problems in the domain of co-ordination arising from these
documents, which call for special attention by the Council.
This Special Committee, whose name was changed in 1966 to
that of the " Committee for Programme and Co-ordination
has held joint meetings with the Administrative Committee on
Co-ordination and the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions. By resolution of January 13, 1970,
the Council reconstituted the Committee for Programme and
Co-ordination to perform wider programming, reviewing, and
co-ordinating functions as to the activities of the United
Nations family in economic and social fields, and enlarged the
Committee to a membership of twenty-one (formerly sixteen).
Organic Structure and Composition
The organic structure and composition of the specialised
agencies and other international bodies vary in the case of
each institution. Nevertheless, they have some features in
common:---


(1) Constitutional Seat or Headquarters.---The Constitutions
of international institutions usually fix the location of the
headquarters, but this is sometimes left for later decision by the
Member States.

------
Chap. 19.-International Institutions
577

(2) Membership.---The Constitution usually provides that
original signatories may become members upon ratification or
acceptance of the instrument, while other States may become
members upon admission by a special majority vote of the
competent organs of the particular international body con-
cerned. Where a clause in a Constitution defines the conditions
under which such other States may be admitted to membership,
it is imperative, according to the International Court of Justice,
that such conditions be strictly adhered to. Under certain
Constitutions of the specialised agencies (for example, the
Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation, UNESCO) the privilege of admission
to membership on acceptance of the Constitution is allowed to
Member States of the United Nations. In the case of certain
specialised agencies, too, for example, the World Health
Organisation (WHO) and the International Telecommunica-
tion Union (ITU), territories or groups of territories may be
admitted to " associate membership", a status which entitles
them to participation in the benefits of the organisation,
without voting rights or the right to become member of an
executive organ. Under the Constitution of the International
Labour Organisation (ILO), territories may be represented at
the International Labour Conference by or through advisers
appointed to the delegation of the Member State responsible
for the territory or territories concerned.

(3) Conditions of Withdrawal by, or Expulsion and Suspension
of, Members. There is no uniform or coherent practice in this
matter. Most usually members are allowed to give a twelve
months' written notice of intention to withdraw; but the
provisions of the Constitutions vary as to the minimum period
of time following admission to membership, when notice may
be given; and as to whether the effectiveness of the notice
depends upon the prior performance of financial or other
obligations. As regards expulsion of members for failure to
fulfil obligations, less value is attached to this as a disciplinary
measure than before the last War; the modern tendency is to
1 _See_ I.C.J. Reports (1948), at pp. 61 _et seq._

------
578
Part 6.- International Institutions
or
make no provision for expulsion, but to allow suspension of
a member's privileges, including voting rights, for default in
financial or other obligations, until these obligations are met.

(4) Organs.---Here, there is a necessary distinction between
principal organs, and regional and subsidiary organs.
The standard principal organs consist of:---


(a) A policy-making body known usually as an " Assembly
Congress ", representative of all Member States, with
power to supervise the working of the organisation, and to
control its budget, and, more frequently, also with power to
adopt Conventions and other measures, and to make recom-
mendations for national legislation (for example, the Assembly
of the World Health Organisation, WHO). Variations may
occur in the frequency of sessions (varying from annual to
quinquennial meetings), the number of delegates, the range of
this organ's supervisory powers, and the authority which may
be delegated to the smaller executive body (_see below_).

(b) A smaller executive body or council, usually elected by
the policy-making organ from among the delegates to it, and
representative of only a specific number of Member States.
Sometimes it is required that the members of this body should
be selected so as to be fairly representative of the States of
most importance in the specialised field (aviation, shipping
and maritime transport, and industrial production) in which
the organisation is active; this is so, for instance, with the
Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation
(ICAO), the Council of the Inter-Governmental Maritime
Consultative Organisation (IMCO), and the Governing Body
of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). In other
instances, it is required that this body should be fairly repre-
sentative of all geographical areas, as, for example, with the
Executive Council of the Universal Postal Union (UPU).
Or, also the members may be chosen from different States, but
with primary emphasis on their personal or technical qualifica-
tions, as in the case of the Executive Board of the United
Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation
(UNESCO), and the Executive Committee of the World

------
Chap. 19.-International Institutions
579
Meterological Organisation (WMO). The degree of executive
authority of this organ may vary from the level of supreme
control in regard to the Member States over a particular subject
matter (as in the case of the High Authority of the European
Coal and Steel Community, under the Treaty of April 18, 1951),
to the level of mere advice and recommendation as in the case of
the Council of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative
Organisation (IMCO).

(C) A Secretariat or international civil service staff. Most
constituent instruments of international organisations stipulate
that the responsibilities of such staff shall be exclusively
international in character, and that they are not to receive
instructions from outside authorities. To reinforce this
position, such instruments generally contain undertakings by
the Member States to respect the international character of the
responsibilities of the staff and not to seek to influence any of
their nationals belonging to such staff in the discharge of their
responsibilities.
As to the international position of members of Secretariats,
a serious problem did arise in 1952 and subsequent years with
regard to the question of " loyalty" investigations of officials
by the Government of the country of which they were nationals.
Although such personnel should abide by the laws of their
country of nationality, particularly if the headquarters of the
institution be situated in that country, it is open to question
whether they should be liable to dismissal or other injurious
consequences for refusing legitimately on grounds of privilege
to answer questions by commissions of inquiry regarding their
loyalty to their country, and their alleged involvement in
subversive activities previously, or while engaged upon their
international responsibilities. These are matters which require
definition by international Convention.
1 In November, 1952, the Secretary-General of the United Nations sought
the opinion of a special committee of jurists on this question and related
aspects. The opinion given, while emphasising the necessity for independence
of the staff of the Secretariat, was none the less to the effect that a refusal to
answer such questions on grounds of privilege created a suspicion of guilt
(Continued)

580
Part 6.-International Institutions
Regional and Subsidiary Organs.---These have been created
with relative freedom, thus accentuating the tendency towards
decentralisation in modern international institutions. Instances
of this flexibility of approach are:---

(1) Regional conferences,
for example, of the International Labour Organisation (ILO),
or regional councils, for example of the Food and Agriculture
Organisation of the United Nations (FAO). (2) The appoint-
ment of advisory or consultative committees, either generally
or for particular subjects (for example, the Consulta-
tive Committees of the International Telecommunication
Union, ITU). (3) The establishment of so-called functional
commissions or committees, dealing with specialised fields of
action (for example, the Functional Commissions of the United
Nations Economic and Social Council, and the special technical
Commissions of the World Meteorological Organisation,
WMO, dealing with aerology, aeronautical meteorology, etc.)

(4) The Administrative Conferences of the International Tele-
communication Union, ITU, at which the representatives of
private operating agencies may attend. Another manifestation
of this flexible devolution of powers is the formation of " work-
ing parties", or of inner groups of States most competent
collectively to deal with certain problems within the framework
of the organisation; e.g., the " Group of Ten" in the Inter-
national Monetary Fund, which has met to discuss, inter alia,
questions of reserves and liquidity (the " Group of Ten " is
composed of the United States, the United Kingdom, France,
Canada, Sweden, Japan, Western Germany, the Nether-
lands, Belgium, and Italy, possessing 83 per cent of the monetary
world reserves). Lastly, there are " programmes ", such as
which, in a suitable case, ought to disentitle the employee to remain a Secre-
tariat official. _See_ United Nations Bulletin (1952), Vol. 13, pp. 601--3. This
opinion was acted upon by the Secretary-General. The United Nations
Administrative Tribunal did not, however, give full support to the com-
mittee's views; _cf._ its judgment in Harris v. Secretary-General of the United
Nations (1953). The Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour
Organisation held in several cases, that a refusal to answer loyalty interroga-
tories was not a sufficient ground for declining to renew the appointment of
an official of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisa-
tion (UNESCO); _see_, e.g., its judgment in Duberg's Case (1955), referred to
in another connection by the International Court of Justice in its advisory
opinion on the judgments of this tribunal, I.C.J. Reports (1956) 77.

the current United Nations Development Programme, which
may operate through a special organ.

(5) Voting Rights.---Voting by a majority of members has
become the more usual requirement for the adoption of
decisions, resolutions, etc., and it is seldom that unanimity is
now prescribed. Special systems of " weighted " voting rights
are applied in some instances (for example, by the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Inter-
national Monetary Fund), the number of votes being calculated
upon a scale depending on the amount of financial contribu-
tions, or actual shares of capital. To that extent, more recent
voting procedure tends" to reflect the power and interests of
the subscribing nations, with particular reference to the extent
to which individual nations will be affected by the organisation's
activities or relied upon to execute its decisions ".1 For the
more important decisions, for example, admission of members,
or amendment of the Constitution, a two-thirds majority is the
more usual rule. The special voting procedure in the United
Nations Security Council is discussed below in this Chapter.2

(6) Reports by Member States.---The Constitutions of these
bodies usually provide for the supervision of reports by Member
States on the action taken in fulfilment of their obligations.

(7) The adoption of Conventions and Recommendations for
action by Member States.---This is discussed below in the
present Chapter 3

(8) Budgetary Questions. The more usual constitutional
provisions are that the Secretary-General or Director-General,
or other executive head of the Secretariat, formulates the estimates
of future expenditure, that these are reviewed and passed by
the policy-making body, subject-in some cases---to inter-
mediate examination by a budgetary committee of that body,
and by the executive organ, and that the total amount is
apportioned among the Member States in shares determined

by the policy-making body. The control by the specialised
agencies over financial and budgetary matters is subject to the
supervisory and recommendatory powers of the United Nations
General Assembly. These powers of the General Assembly
are of the most general nature, extending not only to adminis-
strative expenses _stricto sensu_, but other expenditure in fulfill-
ing the purposes of the United Nations, including costs in-
curred by the Secretary-General in connection with any author-
ised measures to maintain international peace and security,' and
these may be apportioned among the Member States.?
3.-PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES
It is clear that to operate effectively and properly to discharge
their functions, international institutions require certain
privileges and immunities in each country where they may be
located permanently or temporarily. Also the agents and
servants, through whom such institutions must work, similarly
require such privileges as are reasonably necessary for the
performance of their duties. Moreover, in principle, the
income and funds of such organisations should be protected
from State fiscal impositions.
Obviously, this was a matter that needed to be dealt with by
provisions in international Conventions. It could not be left
merely for separate solution by the laws and practice of the
States participating in each international institution. So far
as the United Nations was concerned, it was provided in general
terms in Article 105 of the Charter that the Organisation should
enjoy in the territory of each Member State such privileges and
immunities as were necessary for the fulfilment of its purposes,
that representatives of Member States and officials of the
Organisation should similarly enjoy such privileges and
immunities as were necessary for the independent exercise of
their functions in relation to the United Nations, and that the
General Assembly might make recommendations or propose
_See_ Advisory Opinion on Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17,
paragraph 2 of the Charter), 1.C.J. Reports (1962), 151.
2 Financial Support. The funds of international institutions are provided
principally by:---

(a) contributions from the Member States, equal, or
graduated according to population or economic position; (b) the earnings or
profits of the institution itself.

------
Chap. 19.---International Institutions
583
Conventions for the detailed application of these general
provisions. Similar stipulations on this subject were inserted
in the various Constitutions of the "specialised agencies",
and in treaties and agreements relative to general and regionali
international institutions, in some instances in a more specific
and more detailed form.
In February, 1946, the General Assembly adopted a Con-
vention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations,
providing principally for the following:---


(i) immunity of the
United Nations' property and assets from legal process except
when waived; (ü) inviolability of the Organisation's premises
and archives;2 (iii) freedom from direct taxes and customs
duties for its property and assets; (iv) equivalent treatment
for its official communications to that accorded by Member
States to any Government; (v) special privileges, including
immunity from arrest, inviolability of documents, and freedom
from aliens' registration for representatives of Member States
on organs and conferences of the United Nations; (vi) special
privileges for certain United Nations officials of high rank,
including the status of diplomatic envoys for the Secretary-
General and Assistant Secretaries-General, and special
immunities for other officials, for example, from legal process for
acts performed or words spoken in their official capacity, from
taxation, and from national service obligations; (vii) a laissez-
passer or special travel document for United Nations officials.
In November, 1947, the General Assembly adopted a Con-
vention for the co-ordination of the privileges and immunities
of the specialised agencies with those of the United Nations.
This Convention contained similar standard provisions to
those mentioned above as being contained in the Convention
on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, but
it also consisted of separate draft annexes relating to each
specialised agency, containing special provisions for privileges
1 _See_, e.g., Articles 5--11 of the Agreement on the Status of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), National Representatives, and Inter-
national Staff of September 20, 1951.
* Section 9 of the Agreement of 1947 with the United States for the Head-
  quarters of the United Nations at New York provides for inviolability of the
  Headquarters area.

------
584
Part 6.--International Institutions
and immunities which needed to be made having regard to the
particular nature of each specialised agency; for example,
the draft annex as to the International Labour Organisation
provided for the immunities to be extended to employers' and
workers' members of the Governing Body, subject to waiver
by the Governing Body itself. Each specialised agency was
to be governed by the standard provisions, and was authorised
to draw up, in accordance with its own constitutional pro-
cedure, a special annex of additional amended privileges based
on the draft annex. Under certain of the " protocolary
provisions of the Convention, the full details of which need not
concern us, Member States of each specialised agency under-
took to apply the standard provisions of the Convention in
conjunction with the special provisions of each annex when
finally and properly drawn up. This seems a workmanlike,
if complicated, solution of a difficult problem.
The related questions of the status of the headquarters
(premises and territory) of the United Nations and of the
specialised agencies have been regulated by special agreements
(including the agreement between the United Nations and the
United States of 1947). These agreements reveal the following
common general features:---


(i) The local laws are to apply
within the headquarters district, subject to the application of
staff administrative regulations relative to the Secretariat.

(ii) The premises and property of the organisation are to be
immune from search, requisition, confiscation, etc., and any
other form of interference by the local authorities. (iii) Local
officials cannot enter except with the consent of the organisa-
tion. (iv) The local Government must use due diligence to
protect the premises against outside disturbance and un-
authorised entry. (v) The headquarters are exempt from local
taxes or impositions, except charges for public utility services
(for example, water rates). (vi) The organisation enjoys
freedom of communication, with immunity from censorship.
Privileges and immunities wider than those provided in the
* The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), at Vienna, which is
  not a specialised agency, entered into a Headquarters Agreement with the
  Austrian Government on March 1, 1958.

Chap. 19.-International Institutions
585
two Conventions (or in municipal legislation) may, as a matter
of practice, be granted by States to an international institution.
Also, the Constitution of an international institution may con-
tain its own detailed code of provisions as to the privileges and
immunities of the institution, and officials thereof (_see_, for
example, the Articles of Agreement of the International Finance
Corporation, of May 25, 1955, Article VI, sections 2--11). The
matter may, too, be regulated by bilateral agreement (as for
example the Agreement of November 27, 1961, between the
United Nations and the Congo Republic relating to the
privileges and immunities of the United Nations Operation in
the Congo and that of February 27, 1964, between the United
Nations and Yugoslavia for the 1965 World Population
Conference).
Generally speaking, as a study of the two Conventions and
other instruments shows, the object in granting privileges and
immunities to international institutions has been not to confer
on them an exceptional rank or status of extra-territoriality,
but to enable them to carry out their functions in an inde-
pendent, impartial and efficient manner. The privileges and
immunities are subject to waiver. It is left to the good sense
of such international institutions to decide in the light of the
justice of the case, and of possible prejudice to the organisation,
when these should be pressed, and to the practical discretion
of States to determine how liberal the authorities should be in
giving effect thereto.
Such bilateral agreements may even govern the privileges and immunities
of a peacekeeping force; e.g., the U.N.-Cyprus Exchange of Letters, New
York, March 31, 1964, as to the Force in Cyprus.
_See_, e.g., Article V, Section 20, of the General Convention of 1946 on the
Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations under which, in regard to
officials, other than the Secretary-General, it is the latter's "right and duty"
to waive immunity in any case where immunity would impede the course of
justice, and can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the United
Nations. _Cf._ the Ranollo Case (1946), 67 N.Y.S. (2d) 31 (chauffeur of the
Secretary-General prosecuted for speeding while the Secretary-General was
riding in the car concerned-defendant's immunity not pressed). For a case
in which immunity from proceedings was allowed to China's representative
accredited to the United Nations, _see_ Tsiang v. Tsiang (1949), 86 N.Y.S.
(20) 556.

Part 6.- International Institutions
4. LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL
   INSTITUTIONS
   There is no world legislature in being, but various kinds of
   legislative measures may be adopted by international institu-
   tions, and powers of promoting the preparation of Conventions
   are vested in the General Assembly, the Economic and Social
   Council, and the International Law Commission of the United
   Nations. Five of the specialised agencies are indeed largely
   regulative institutions, namely, the International Labour
   Organisation, the World Health Organisation, the International
   Civil Aviation Organisation, the International Telecommunica-
   tion Union, and the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consulta-
   tive Organisation. Mention may be made of the following
   special legislative techniques of these bodies:---a) The adoption
   of regional Regulations or operating "Procedures " (for
   example, by regional meetings of the International Civil
   Aviation Organisation). (b) The participation of non-
   governmental representatives in the legislative processes (for
   example, workers' and employers' delegates in the International
   Labour Conference, and private operating agencies at
   Administrative Conferences of the International Telecommuni-
   cation Union). (c) Regulations (such as, e.g., the smallpox
   vaccination certificate regulations of 1956) adopted by the
   World Health Assembly, which come into force for all members,
   except those who "contract out", i.e., give notice of rejection
   or reservations within a certain period. (d) The adoption of
   model regulations as an annex to a Final Act or other
   instrument; e.g., the International Regulations for Preventing
   Collisions at Sea, annexed to the Final Act of the 1960 London
   Conference for the Safety of Life at Sea.
   This development has been accompanied by the emergence,
   parallel to that in municipal law, of the similar phenomena
   of:---

(1) Delegated legislation; for example, the powers given
   to the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation
   to amend or extend the annexes to the International Civil
   1 The various legislative expedients employed within the framework of this
   Organisation are well analysed in Thomas Buergenthal's valuable book,
   Law-Making in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (1969).

Chap. 19.-International Institutions
587
Aviation Convention of December 7, 1944. A specially
important case is that of the powers conferred upon the Council
and the Commission of the European Economic Community
(Common Market) to frame and promulgate Regulations,
general in their scope, and directly binding upon the citizens
and enterprises of Member States of the Community (_see_
Article 189 of the Treaty of March 25, 1957, establishing the
Community). In addition to Regulations there are the
" directives", binding States, receiving these, with regard to
the end-result, but leaving them with some initiative in the
matter of ways and means. (2) The making of subordinate
law; for example, the adoption by the United Nations General
Assembly of its own Rules of Procedure, and of the so-called
" Administrative Instruments", i.e., the Treaty Registration
Regulations, the Statute of the Administrative Tribunal, and
the Staff Regulations.
5.-- INTERNATIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW
As in municipal law, not only administrative, but quasi-
judicial functions have been conferred upon the organs of
international institutions. In this connection, reference may
be made, by way of illustration, to the number of quasi-
judicial powers bestowed on the Commission of the European
Economic Community (Common Market), e.g. to determine
whether a measure of State aid granted by a Member State is
• incompatible with the Common Market, or is applied in an
unfair manner (_see_ Article 93 of the Treaty of March 25, 1957
establishing the Community).
In turn, this has made it necessary to provide for judicial
review, that is to say, the exercise of a supervisory jurisdiction
to ensure that such organs do not exceed their legal powers.
Thus, the Court of Justice of the European Communities
has, under the Treaties of April 18, 1951, and of March 25,
1957, establishing respectively the European Coal and Steel
Community and the European Economic Community (Com-
mon Market), jurisdiction to review the legality of acts or
decisions of certain organs of the Communities on the grounds,
inter alia, of lack of legal competence, procedural error, in-
1 _See above_, p. 426 n. 1.

------
588
Part 6.- International Institutions
fringement of the Treaties or of any rule of law relating to their
application, or abuse or misapplication of powers. This
supervisory jurisdiction is not to apply to the conclusions upon
questions of fact considered by these bodies. Another
example of such judicial review is the provision in the Statute
of the Administrative Tribunal of the United Nations (which
deals with complaints by United Nations staff concerning
alleged breaches of the terms of their employment, etc.)
enabling the International Court of Justice to determine by
advisory opinion whether the Tribunal has exceeded its powers,
or erred in law or procedure. The Administrative Tribunal of
the United Nations and the similar Tribunal of the Inter-
national Labour Organisation are themselves working illustra-
tions of the vitality of international administrative law.
Mention may also be made of the powers given to the organs
of some international institutions to determine questions con-
cerning the interpretation or application of the constituent
instrument of the institution, for example, the Council of the
International Civil Aviation Organisation under Articles 84--86
of the International Civil Aviation Convention of December 7,
1944, and the Executive Directors and Board of Governors of the
International Monetary Fund under Article XVIII of the
Articles of Agreement of the Fund.
Finally, as in the municipal administrative domain, there
has developed the practice whereby an organ of an inter-
national institution delegates an inquiry to a smaller Com-
mittee or other body; for example, complaints as to infringe-
ments of trade union rights come for preliminary examination
before the Committee on Freedom of Association, on behalf of
the Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation.
This Committee is to some extent a quasi-judicial body.
6.-QUASI-DIPLOMATIC AND TREATY RELATIONS OF
INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
Not only is the accreditation of permanent missions by
Member States to the United Nations and the specialised

agencies well-established, but there have already been instances
of quasi-diplomatic appointments by United Nations organs,
for example, the appointment in 1949 of a United Nations
Commissioner to assist the inhabitants of Libya in attaining
independent self-government, and the appointment in 1960 of
a Special Representative of the Secretary-General in the
Congo. Apart from these cases, the United Nations and the
related agencies under the provisions of their relationship
agreements and inter-agency agreements for reciprocal repre-
sentation and liaison, exchange and receive representatives
from each other.
Treaty Relations
The Constitutions of certain international institutions
expressly contemplate the exercise of a treaty-making power;
for example, the United Nations Charter provides for the
conclusion of trusteeship agreements, and of relationship
agreements with the specialised agencies. Besides, inter-
national institutions must, as a matter of implication from
their Constitutions, have such treaty-making power as is
necessary for the performance of their functions. Wide treaty-
making power has, in some instances, been conferred upon
regional international institutions, e.g. the European Economic
Community (Common Market), under Article 238 of the Treaty
of Rome of March 25, 1957, establishing the Community.
At all events, a large number of international bodies have
_de facto_ entered into treaties, both _inter se_ and with States and
other entities. These instruments reveal a significant flexibility
and simplicity, with but limited deference to Chancery
traditions. In passing, reference may also be made to the
absence from these agreements of the usual formal or "proto-
colary" clauses, and to the analogy to ratification in the
usual requirement in these instruments that the agreement

which visited outposts in the Congo.

concerned is to come into force only when" approved" by the
policy-making body of the institution.
7.- DISSOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS; AND
SUCCESSION TO RIGHTS, DUTIES AND FUNCTIONS
Dissolution
International institutions become dissolved:---

(a) If created
for a limited period only, upon the expiration of that period.

(b) If of a transitional nature, upon the passing of the situation
or the fulfilment of the purpose for which they were created.

(C) By decision of the members, express or implied. It would
seem that such decision need not necessarily be unanimous,
but that it is sufficient as a practical matter if it be by a sub-
stantial majority, including the votes of the greater Powers.
Thus, the League of Nations and the Permanent Court of
International Justice were declared to be dissolved by Resolu-
tions of the League of Nations Assembly in plenary session
on April 18, 1946, without the individual assent of all Member
States or of all parties to the Statute of the Court. In the
absence of any express contrary provision in the constituent
instrument, there is implied power in the members or cor-
porators of an international institution to dissolve it.
The liquidation of the assets and affairs of the dissolved
organisation is another matter. Practice here supplies no
guide. In the case of the League of Nations, there were
special circumstances, inasmuch as all parties concerned desired
to vest as much as possible of the assets upon dissolution in
the United Nations and the specialised agencies.?
Succession and International Institutions
Where problems arise of the succession of one international
institution to the rights, duties, etc., of another, the question
i Note, also, that it was by a Protocol signed by delegates to the World
Health Conference at New York on July 22, 1946, that the Office International
d'Hygiène Publique was dissolved.

Journal of International Law (1948), Vol. 42, at pp. 320 _et seq._

------
Chap. 19.--International Institutions
591
of the transmission of constitutional functions, in addition to
the passing of rights and duties, is involved. 1
First, it is essential that the successor institution shall
expressly or impliedly have constitutional competence to take
over the rights and functions of the predecessor. For example,
Article 72 of the Constitution of the World Health Organisation
enabled the Organisation to take over resources and obligations
from bodies of cognate competence, and in virtue of that
constitutional authority, the functions and assets of the Health
Organisation of the League of Nations duly passed to the
World Health Organisation.
Second, the successor institution cannot take over a function
which does not lie within its constitutional competence, a
principle which explains the non-passing, as a rule, of political
functions. Thus in 1946 the Executive Committee of the
Preparatory Commission of the United Nations advised against
the transfer of the League's political functions to the United
Nations, the political responsibilities of the two bodies being
markedly dissimilar. It may be mentioned, however, that
the United Nations did take over from the League certain
functions which it was desirable in the interests of the inter-
national community that it should possess, namely, the custody
of treaties, the international control of narcotic drugs, the
suppression of the traffic in women and children, and inquiries
concerning the status of women.
A novel question of implied succession came before the
International Court of Justice in 1950, and was dealt with in
its Advisory Opinion on the International Status of South-West
Africa.3 From that Advisory Opinion, the principle emerges
that where an international organ such as the League of
Nations Permanent Mandates Commission, which is dis-
charging certain functions in the international sphere, is
1 The succession of an institution to the powers of another which has ceased
to be, involves different considerations from the case of a reconstituted
organisation. Quaere, whether the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OÉCD), which replaced the Organisation for European
Economic Co-operation (OEEC), with wider geographical and other powers,
was a case of "
"reconstitution

dissolved, and the continued execution of those functions has
not been provided for by treaty or otherwise, those functions
may then automatically devolve upon an international organ,
such as the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations,
which is discharging cognate functions in regard to a similar
field of activity. The Court's view was, in fact, that in respect
of the Mandated Territory of South-West Africa, although
South Africa had not, as she was so entitled, accepted the
supervision of the United Nations General Assembly and
Trusteeship Council, these bodies could none the less dis-
charge the similar functions of supervision of the extinct
Mandates Commission.2
If the constituent instrument of the successor institution sets
out the precise terms and conditions under which the functions
of the predecessor devolve upon the new body, the question
of succession is governed by these express provisions. No
better illustration of this principle can be given than the
present Statute of the International Court of Justice, successor
to the Permanent Court of International Justice (_see_, e.g.,
Articles 36--37).
8.---THE UNITED NATIONS
The United Nations is a pivotal organ of world government,
and the most important of all international institutions. As
we have seen earlier in this chapter through it are integrated
those international bodies known as the "specialised agencies
but this function of co-ordinating international organs by no
means exhausts its responsibilities. It now has a membership
of 130 States, making it for all practical purposes a universal
organisation.
The true name of the Organisation is the " United Nations" ,
1 But this organ would not necessarily be bound by the procedure followed
by its predecessor; _see_ Advisory Opinion on the Admissibility of Hearings of
Petitioners by the Committee on South-West Africa, I.C.J. Reports (1956), 23
(General Assembly could authorise oral hearings of petitioners, notwithstand-
ing contrary practice of Permanent Mandates Commission).
2 There can be no succession of rights, from an international institution
to individual member States where they did not possess previously the rights
claimed to pass; South West Africa Cases, 2nd Phase, I.C.J. Reports, 1966, 6,

although it is often referred to as the United Nations
Organisation" or " UNO".
The United Nations may be simply defined as an organisation
of independent States (130 in number, as mentioned above),
which have accepted the obligations contained in the United
Nations Charter signed at San Francisco on June 26, 1945.
This definition needs to be amplified by considering the origins
of the Charter and the nature of the machinery created under it.
Origins
The principles stated in the Charter were derived from the
conceptions and plans of the wartime Allies, which first found
expression in :---

(a) The Atlantic Charter subscribed to by the
President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great
Britain in August, 1941.1 (b) The United Nations Declaration
signed by twenty-six nations on New Year's Day, 1942, after
Japan had opened hostilities in the Pacific. (c) The Moscow
Declaration of October, 1943, issued by the Governments of
the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and China,
recognising the need for establishing a general international
organisation based on the principle of the sovereign equality
of all peace-loving States, and open to membership of all
States large or small, in order to maintain international peace
and security.
In the late summer and early autumn of 1944, draft proposals
for such an organisation were worked out at Dumbarton Oaks
by representatives of these four Powers. Then at the Yalta
Conference in February, 1945, of leaders of the Big Three-
the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union-the
decision was taken, at a time when final victory against
Germany was imminent, to call a general conference of about
fifty nations to consider a Constitution based on the Dumbarton
Oaks proposals. At Yalta, agreement was also reached on
voting procedure and arrangements in the proposed Security
Council of the new Organisation. Two months later, a Com-
mittee of Jurists representing forty-four countries met at
1 For discussion of the Atlantic Charter, _see_ Stone, The Atlantic Charter
(1943).

594
Part 6.- International Institutions
99
Washington and drafted a Statute for the proposed Inter-
national Court of Justice, which was to be an integral part of
the proposed Organisation.
The Conference to consider the Dumbarton Oaks proposals
held its discussions at San Francisco from April 25 to June 26,
1945, and succeeded in drawing up the present United Nations
Charter, containing also the Statute of the International Court
of Justice. The debates were by no means free of disagree-
ments, particularly between the Four Sponsoring Powers---the
United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and China-
and the delegates of the so-called "middle" and "small
Powers over such matters as the "veto" in the Security
Council, and the functions of the General Assembly. In the
circumstances, it is remarkable that in the short space of two
calendar months there should have emerged an instrument so
detailed and comprehensive as the Charter.
It is of importance to notice the main differences between it
and the Dumbarton Oaks drafts. They are as follows:---


(1) The principles and purposes of the United Nations were
broadened in scope and the obligations of the Member States
defined in more precise terms. (2) The powers of the General
Assembly were extended. (3) The United Nations was given
enlarged authority in the economic, social, cultural, and
humanitarian fields. (4) Provisions were added to the Charter
concerning the encouragement of human rights and funda-
mental freedoms. (5) Important modifications were made in
the provisions as to regional arrangements and regional
agencies. (6) The trusteeship provisions. (7) The Economic
and Social Council was made a principal organ of the United
Nations with far-reaching responsibilities in its particular
sphere.
The United Nations came into being on October 24, 1945
(" United Nations Day'), on the Charter receiving the
ratifications necessary to bring it into force, being those of
China, France, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and the United
States, and of a majority of the other signatories. The first

595
meeting of the General Assembly was held in London on
January 10, 1946, while only three months later there took
place the last session of the League of Nations Assembly for
winding up the League as a going concern.
Differences between the United Nations and the League of
Nations
The dissolution of the League of Nations should not obscure
the fact that the United Nations Charter owes much to the
League experience, and for its provisions drew heavily on
the League's traditions, practice and machinery. Yet although
the United Nations is successor to the League and in many
ways patterned on it, there are fundamental differences between
the two institutions which need to be noted:---


(a) The obligations of Member States of the United Nations
are stated in the most general terms, for example, to settle
disputes peacefully, to fulfil in good faith their obligations under
the Charter, etc. The obligations of Member States of the
League on the other hand were stated and defined in the League
Covenant in the most specific manner, for example in the
detailed procedures they bound themselves to follow in respect
of the settlement of disputes without resorting to war
(Articles 12, 13 and 15).

(b) In the United Nations there are, apart from the
Secretariat, five principal organs, the General Assembly,
the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the
Trusteeship Council and the International Court of Justice,
and the respective spheres of each organ are carefully defined
so as to prevent overlapping. In the League, there were,
apart from the Secretariat, two principal organs only, the
Assembly and the Council, and each was able to deal" with
any matter within the sphere of action of the League or affecting
the peace of the world" (Articles 3 and 4 of the Covenant).

(c) More emphasis is given in the Charter than in the League
Covenant to economic, social, cultural and humanitarian
matters.

(d) There are substantial differences between the " sanctions

------
596
Part 6.- International Institutions
provisions in Article 16 of the League Covenant and the pro-
visions for "preventive" and " enforcement action" in
Chapter VII of the Charter. The United Nations (through the
Security Council) is not limited in taking "enforcement
action ", as was the League of Nations to situations where
Member States have gone to war in breach of their covenants
and obligations under the Charter; it can take such action
if there is merely a threat to the peace, or if a breach of the
peace or an act of aggression has been committed. Moreover,
the Members of the United Nations have bound themselves
in advance to provide armed forces on terms to be agreed with
the Security Council, and the Security Council is to be advised
and assisted by a Military Staff Committee in the direction of
these forces. There were no similar stipulations in the League
Covenant.

(e) Under the Charter, decisions are by majority vote,
although in the Security Council, decisions, except on pro-
cedural matters, must have the concurrence of the five Great
Powers, who are the permanent members. In the League all
decisions of importance required unanimity. It would however
be unfair to regard this contrast as unfavourable to the League,
for not only:---

(a) were there several exceptions to the rule of
unanimity, including the provisions in Article 15 of the League
Covenant that the votes of parties to a dispute were not to be
counted when the League Council made its report and recom-
mendations thereon, but (b) the effectiveness of the League
Covenant depended on its observance by the Member States
rather than on the organic decisions of League bodies, whereas
under the United Nations Charter, the emphasis is on the
organic decisions of bodies such as the Security Council, and
less on the specific obligations of Member States.
" Purposes " and "Principles "
The " Purposes" of the United Nations are stated in Article 1
of the Charter from which it appears that the United Nations is
primarily an organisation for maintaining peace and security,
with the additional functions of developing friendly relations

------
Chup. 19.---International Institutions
597
among nations, of achieving international co-operation in
economic, social, cultural and humanitarian matters, of
developing respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms,
and of providing a means for harmonising international action
to attain these aims. It is questionable whether these general
objectives, constituting the _raison d'être_ of the Organisation,
can be regarded as embodying rules of law, authorising its
organs and Member States to take action not specifically
provided for in the operative articles of the Charter.
Article 2 of the Charter also sets out certain " Principles ".
Two of these "Principles" are laid down for organic observance
by the United Nations itself, namely, that the basis of the
United Nations shall be the sovereign equality of all its
Members and that it shall not intervene (except where" enforce-
ment action" is called for) in matters " essentially " within the
domestic jurisdiction of any State. Four other
Four other "Principles
are set down for observance by Member States, namely, that
they should fulfil their obligations under the Charter, settle
their disputes by peaceful means, not threaten or use force
against the territorial integrity or political independence of any
State, and give assistance to the United Nations while denying
such assistance to any State against which preventive or
enforcement action is being taken.
Membership
The Members of the United Nations consist of:---

(a) original
Menibers; and (b) Members admitted in accordance with
Article 4 of the Charter.
The original Members are those States which having
participated in the San Francisco Conference of 1945 or having
signed the United Nations Declaration on New Year's Day,
1942, sign and ratify the Charter.
As to Members other than the original Members, Article 4
of the Charter provides that membership is open to "all other
peace-loving States which accept the obligations contained in
the present Charter and, in the judgment of the Organisation,
are able and willing to carry out these obligations ", and that
such admission will be effected by a decision of the General

------
598
Part 6.-
International Institutions
Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council
(this in effect means by at least a two-thirds vote of the General
Assembly on the recommendation of at least nine Members
of the Security Council including the five permanent Members).
In its Advisory Opinion on Conditions of Membership in the
United Nations (1948)," the International Court of Justice by a
majority held that Article 4 lays down five conditions by way of
exhaustive enumeration, and not merely by way of illustration,
namely, that any new applicant must:(a) be a State; (b) be
peace-loving; (c) accept the obligations of the Charter;

(d) be able to carry out these obligations; and (e) be willing
to do so. The Court also ruled that a State Member voting on
the admission of a new State (whether on the Security Council
recommendation or on the General Assembly decision) is not
entitled to make its consent to the admission of an applicant
dependent on the fulfilment of conditions other than those
prescribed in Article 4, and in particular is not entitled to make
such consent dependent on the admission of other applicants.
In the Court's view a State Member must in voting have
regard only to the qualifications of a candidate for admission
as set out in Article 4, and not take into account extraneous
political considerations.
Under present usage and procedure (_see_, for example, Rule 60
of the Rules of Procedure of the Security Council) the Security
Council practically decides in the first instance on the applica-
tion of a State for admission as a new Member, and by reason
of the " veto" may fail to make an effective recommendation.
The International Court of Justice has, however, ruled that the
General Assembly cannot by its own decision admit a new
Member State, where the Security Council has failed to make
any recommendation as to admission to membership, favour-
able or otherwise. The General Assembly remains, of course,
always free to reject a candidate recommended by the Security
Council.
In December, 1955, a remarkable expedient was adopted to

overcome admission blockages in the Security Council.
Sixteen States were admitted as new Members of the United
Nations as the result of a so-called " package deal", whereby
one group of voting States made its affirmative vote for certain
candidates conditional on an affirmative vote by another group
for the remaining candidates. By a strained, if not utterly
elastic construction of the Advisory Opinion, _supra_, on Con-
ditions of Membership in the United Nations (1948), this " deal
was considered not to be inconsistent with the Court's opinion
that a conditional consent to admission is not permitted by the
Charter.
Articles 5--6 of the Charter deal with the suspension or
expulsion of Member States, which is effected by a decision of
the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Securit
Council. Members may be suspended from exercising the
rights and privileges of membership if preventive or enforce-
ment action is taken against them by the Security Council, or
be expelled if they persistently violate the principles of the
Charter.
Organs of the United Nations
The United Nations differs from the League of Nations in
its decentralised character, the powers and functions under the
Charter being distributed among six different major organs:---


(1) The General Assembly. (2) The Security Council. (3) The
Economic and Social Council. (4) The Trusteeship Council.

(5) The International Court of Justice. (6) The Secretariat.
Each organ has sharply defined spheres of action, and although
in a sense the residue of authority is vested in the General
Assembly, the latter's powers are mainly supervisory and
recommendatory, so that possibly some particular field of
international action may be outside the operational competence
of the United Nations.
The General Assembly
The General Assembly is the only principal organ of the
United Nations consisting of all Members, each Member

------

Part 6.- International Institutions
having only one vote, though allowed five representatives. It
meets regularly once a year, but can meet in special session if
summoned by the Secretary-General at the request of the
Security Council or of a majority of the Members of the
United Nations, or at the request of one Member concurred in
by a majority of the Members.
It is essentially a deliberative body, with powers of dis-
cussion, investigation, review, supervision and criticism in
relation to the work of the United Nations as a whole (_see_
Article 10 of the Charter), and of the various other organs of
world government including the specialised agencies. Generally
speaking, its powers are limited to making recommendations
and not binding decisions, although it is empowered to take
certain final decisions, for example, as to the budget or as to the
admission, suspension or expulsion of Members. However,
its recommendations, while not creating legal obligations, may
operate with permissive force to authorise action by Member
States.Votes on "important " questions such as the election
of the non-permanent members of the Security Council and
other questions specifically enumerated in Article 18, para-
graph 2, of the Charter are to be taken by a two-thirds majority;
other questions, including the determination of additional
"important " questions requiring a two-thirds majority vote,
are to be dealt with by a simple majority vote. The five Great
Powers, who are permanent members of the Security Council,
have no right of " veto" as they do when voting in the
Council.
The General Assembly's powers and functions consist of the
following:---


(i) powers of discussion and recommendation in
relation to the maintenance of international peace and security;

(ii) the direction and supervision of international economic
and social co-operation; (iii) the supervision of the inter-
national trusteeship system; (iv) the consideration of informa-
tion as to non-self-governing territories; (v) budgetary and
financial powers whereby it has exclusive control over the
1 It is, however, doubtful whether such recommendations could authorise
independent international institutions, e.g., the International Bank for Recon-
struction and Development (World Bank) to take action, which their com-
petent organs had not duly decided upon.

Chap. 19.-International Institutions
601
finances of the United Nations; (vi) powers of admitting,
suspending and expelling States Members (_see above_); (vii)
powers in relation to the adoption of amendments to the Charter
(_see_ Articles 108--109); (viii) the election of members of other
organs; (ix) the receipt and consideration of reports on the
work of the United Nations; and (x) the adoption of inter-
national Conventions. But, as Article 10 of the Charter shows,
its powers of discussion and recommendation are not limited to
these matters.
Although the primary responsibility for the maintenance of
peace and security belongs to the Security Council, the General
Assembly is given in this connection certain facultative or
permissive powers of consideration and recommendation. It
may consider" the general principles of co-operation in the
maintenance of peace and security including the principles as to
disarmament and armament regulation, and may make
recommendations on the subject to the Member States or to
the Security Council (Article 11, paragraph 1); it may
discuss" any specific questions relative to the maintenance of
peace and security brought before it by a Member State or
by the Security Council or by a non-Member and make
recommendations thereon (Article 11, paragraph 2); it "may
recommend" measures for the peaceful adjustment of any
situation likely to impair the general welfare or friendly
relations among nations (Article 14); and it "may call the
attention " of the Security Council, as the body primarily
responsible for enforcing peace, to any situation likely to
endanger peace and security (Article 11, paragraph 3). There
is one general restriction on these powers of recommendation,
namely, that while, in the exercise of its functions under the
Charter, the Security Council is actively dealing with any
dispute or situation, the General Assembly---although it is
not precluded from discussion is not to make a recommenda-
tion in regard thereto unless the Security Council so requests
(Article 12, paragraph 1). But to prevent important matters
relating to peace and security from being "frozen
Security Council agenda and therefore from coming under the
searchlight of General Assembly procedures, it is provided
on the

------
602
Part 6.- International Institutions
that the Secretary-General is with the Security Council's
consent to notify the General Assembly when such matters are
being dealt with, and immediately the Security Council ceases
to deal with them.
Within these limits, it is remarkable that in practice the
General Assembly has been able to take a leading role in
questions of international peace and security. It has discussed
some of the leading political problems brought before the
United Nations such as those relating to Palestine, Greece,
Spain, Korea, Suez, and the Congo, and also taken concrete
action with reference to them. For instance, in regard to
Palestine, it appointed a Special Committee in 1947 to in-
vestigate the facts, and subsequently in 1948 appointed a
Mediator to secure peace between the parties in strife,
and later a Conciliation Commission. As mentioned below,
it materially contributed to the settlement of the Suez Canal
zone conflict in October-November, 1956, and in September,
1960, it authorised the continued maintenance in the Congo of a
United Nations Force.
The stultifying result of the " veto " upon the work of the
Security Council brought about a further significant develop-
ment, under which the General Assembly impinged more and
more upon the broad field of peace and security, to the extent
of making general, and even specific, recommendations in this
domain, although it could not of course compel compliance
with these recommendations. Moreover, it came to be
accepted that a matter might be removed from the agenda of
the Security Council by a procedural vote, thus eliminating the
use of the " veto" to preclude a matter from being brought
before the General Assembly.
Illustrations of this important development are the following:

(a) The recommendations made by the General Assembly in
April, 1949, for setting up a panel of individuals to serve on
commissions of inquiry and conciliation, and that the Security
Council examine the desirability of using the procedure of
rapporteurs or conciliators for disputes or situations brought

------
Chap. 19.-- International Institutions
603
before the Council for action. (b) The so-called "Uniting
for Peace" General Assembly Resolution of November 3, 1950,
providing for emergency special sessions at 24 hours' notice
on the vote of any seven members of the Security Council, or
of a majority of Member States, if the Security Council failed
to act because of the " veto ", and pursuant to which there were
set up a Peace Observation Commission, to observe and report
on the situation in any area where international tension
threatened international peace and security, and a Collective
Measures Committee, to consider methods which might be
used collectively to maintain and strengthen international
peace and security. (C) The General Assembly recommenda-
tions on November 17, 1950, as to the appointment of a Per-
manent Commission of Good Offices. (d) The several General
Assembly Resolutions relative to the situation in Korea,
1950--1953, including the Resolution of February 1, 1951,
pursuant to which there was set up an Additional Measures
Committee, composed of members of the Collective Measures
Committee, which reported on measures of economic enforce-
ment action to be taken. (e) The General Assembly's efforts
in 1961,2 leading to the establishment of an Eighteen-Nation
Disarmament Committee, 3 to undertake negotiations for
general and complete disarmament under international control.
The part played by the General Assembly in November,
1956, in effecting a cease-fire in the Suez Canal zone conflict,
involving Israel, Egypt, France, and Great Britain, represents
perhaps the high water mark of its work on peace and security.
After Security Council action had proved impossible because
of the "veto ", a special emergency session of the Assembly
was convened for November 1, 1956, by a vote of seven
members of the Security Council, in pursuance of the "Uniting
for Peace" Resolution, mentioned above. At this session, the
Assembly adopted Resolutions for a cease-fire by all con-
testants, and for the creation of a United Nations Emergency

Part 6.-International Institutions
Forcel to guarantee peaceful conditions in the Suez area,
with the ultimate consequence that peace and order were
restored.
Another instance of significant General Assembly action,
pursuant to the "Uniting for Peace" Resolution, occurred
on September 19, 1960, when the General Assembly authorised
the Secretary-General to continue to take vigorous action
pursuant to the earlier Resolutions of the Security Council
for United Nations military assistance to maintain law and
order in the Congo.?
Reference may also be made to the creation by the General
Assembly, in 1947, of an Interim Committee (the so-called
" Little Assembly ") to assist it in its duties in relation to
maintaining peace and security. This Committee was made
necessary by the fact that the General Assembly is under
continual pressure at its annual sessions to dispose of a heavy
agenda, and needs to make its own arrangements for keeping
in touch with questions of peace and security. It was thought
that through such a body as the Interim Committee, with a
watching brief over all matters of peace and security and with
the power to carry out special studies or inquiries, the General
Assembly could effectively discharge its functions in relation
to peace and security without detracting from the authority of
the Security Council or intervening in the Council's work.
1 United Nations Forces. The respective powers of the Security Council
and of the General Assembly to establish United Nations field forces are dis-
cussed by Sohn, American Journal of International Law (1958), Vol. 52, at
pp. 229--240. Clearly, the Security Council may authorise the creation of an
observer group force (as in Lebanon in 1958), e.g., to supervise a truce. It is,
however, a matter of controversy whether either organ may establish forces
in order to restore or maintain peace and security, in the absence of a valid
decision of the Security Council to institute enforcement action under Chapter
VII of the Charter; _see below_, pp. 617--618, as to the Security Council and the
continuing Congo situation. _See also_ Bowett, United Nations Forces (1964),
and pp. 620--621, _post._, as to United Nations peacekeeping. Reference
should be made also to the use of the Swedish Stand-by Disaster Relief Unit,
made available through the United Nations pursuant to a tripartite agreement
between that body, Peru, and Sweden, for rehabilitation work in Peru following
the earthquake in May, 1970. What has been called " disaster preparedness
presumably falls within the international humanitarian powers of the United
Nations (_cf._ Article 1, paragraph 3 of the Charter).

The Interim Committee reported in 1947--1948 to the General
Assembly on two important matters which it investigated :---


(a) The adoption of practices and procedures designed to
reduce difficulties due to the " veto " in the Security Council.1

(b) Methods for promoting international co-operation in the
political field.
This Interim Committee is but one example of the de-
centralisation that the General Assembly did effect internally,
to cope with its work. It has established Procedural
Committees, Main Committees3 which meet in connection
with plenary sessions, Standing Committees (such as the
Committee on Contributions, the Advisory Committee on
Administrative and Budgetary Questions, and the Board of
Auditors), and subsidiary bodies for important political and
security matters, such as the Disarmament Commission, 4
subject to a duty of reporting to the Security Council.
The General Assembly is in addition given the mandatory
power, as distinct from the facultative or permissive powers set
out above, of initiating studies and making recommendations
for the purpose of promoting international co-operation in the
political field and of encouraging the progressive development
of international law and its codification (_see_ Article 13,
paragraph 1, a).5
As to (ii), p. 600, the direction and supervision of international
economic and social co-operation, the General Assembly
1 This report formed the basis of a General Assembly recommendation in
April, 1949, that permanent members of the Security Council confer on the
use of the
veto ", that they refrain from using it in certain specific cases,
and that they treat certain questions as procedural.
2 Including recommendations as to rapporteurs or conciliators in Security
Council matters, and a panel of persons to serve on commissions of inquiry
and conciliation, adopted by the Assembly; _see above_, pp. 478, 602.
3 These are the First (Political and Security Questions), Special Political
Committee (sharing the work of the First Committee), Second (Economic
and Financial Questions), Third (Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural
Questions), Fourth (Trusteeship and Non-Self-Governing Territories), Fifth
(Administrative and Budgetary Questions), and Sixth (Legal Questions).
Established on January 11, 1952, in replacement of the two former
Commissions, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Commission for
Conventional Armaments.

International Law Commission.

exercises the powers and functions of the United Nations in
this sphere (Articles 13 and 60), the Economic and Social
Council being under its authority. As referred to above,
it also approves the "relationship agreements " negotiated by
the Economic and Social Council with the specialised
agencies ", and is authorised to make recommendations for
co-ordinating the work and policies of these agencies. In
regard to (iii), the supervision of the international trusteeship
system, the General Assembly's powers in this field have been
dealt with in Chapter 5.
One of the General Assembly's most important functions is
to elect members of other organs (_see_ (viii), p. 601); thus it
elects the ten non-permanent members of the Security Council
(Article 23), the 27 members of the Economic and Social
Council (Article 61), and by a system of parallel voting in
conjunction with the Security Council, the fifteen Judges of
the International Court of Justice. It also appoints the
Secretary-General.
Finally, mention should be made of its international
legislative functions (_see_ (x), p. 601). Already it has approved
and adopted the texts of several international Conventions,
including the Conventions on the Privileges and Immunities
of the United Nations, and of the Specialised Agencies of
1946 and 1947 respectively, and the Genocide Convention of
1948, while it took the final decision to summon the Geneva
Conference on 1958 on the Law of the Sea, and the Vienna
Conferences of 1961, 1963, and 1968--9 on Diplomatic Rela-
tions, Consular Relations, and the Law of Treaties, resulting
in Conventions on these subjects.
The Security Council
The Security Council is a continuously functioning body,
consisting of fifteen Member States; five are permanent and
are named in the Charter, being China, France, the Soviet
Union, Great Britain and the United States. Tenº non-per-
i _See_ pp. 571--575.
2 Formerly the number was six, but this was increased to ten under amend-
ments to the Charter which came into force in 1965.

manent members are elected by the General Assembly for a
term of two years, and in their election due regard is to be
specially paid in the first instance to the contribution of Member
States to the maintenance of peace and security, to the other
purposes of the United Nations, and to equitable geographical
distribution (Article 23). There are provisions for par-
ticipation in the Security Council's discussions by States other
than permanent and non-permanent members:---

(a) any
Member State of the United Nations may participate without
vote in a discussion of any question brought before the Security
Council if the Council considers the interests of that Member
are specially affected (Article 31); (b) any such Member State
or any non-Member State, if it is a party to a dispute being
considered by the Security Council, is to be invited to par-
ticipate without vote in the discussions concerning the dispute
(Article 32).
Voting Procedure in the Security Council
The voting procedure in the Security Council requires
special consideration. Each member of the Council has one
vote. Decisions on procedural matters are to be made by an
affirmative vote of nine members. Decisions on all other
matters are to be made by an affirmative vote of nine members,
including the concurring votes of the five permanent members.
It is here that the so-called " veto " operates, as if a permanent
member does not affirmatively vote in favour of a particular
decision, that decision is blocked or "vetoed ", and fails
legally to come into existence.
There are certain exceptions to the rigidity of the " veto
provisions, both under the Charter and in practice. Under
the Charter, in connection with decisions concerning the
pacific settlement of disputes, whether under Chapter VI or
under Article 52, paragraph 3 (reference of a dispute to regional
settlement), any permanent or non-permanent member, if a
party to the particular dispute under consideration, must
abstain from voting (Article 27, paragraph 3). The exception
in practice is that the voluntary abstention of a permanent
member from voting has consistently been interpreted as not

constituting a bar to the validity of a Security Council decision;
the legality of the practice was upheld by the International Court
of Justice in the Advisory Opinion of June 21, 1971, on the
Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of
South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa), in which it ruled
that a Security Council Resolution of 1970 declaring illegal the
continued presence of South Africa in South West Africa
(Namibia) was not invalid by reason of the abstention from
voting of two permanent members; _see_ I.C.J. Reports, 1971, 16,
at p. 22.
Since the inception of the Security Council, the permanent
members' right of veto has been the subject of questionings.
Such questionings were foreshadowed at the San Francisco
Conference, and publicists and writers claimed that the
original doubts have been justified inasmuch as the power of
veto has been abused. The central theory behind the right
of veto is that since the permanent members as Great Powers
naturally bear the main burden of responsibility for maintaining
peace and security, no one permanent member should be
compelled by a vote of the Security Council to follow a course
of action with which it disagrees. In other words, the possi-
bility of division among the Great Powers on particular
questions of collective security was foreseen. At the San
Francisco Conference, the Four Sponsoring Powers (Great
Britain, the United States, Russia and China) issued a Joint
Interpretative Statement pointing out that the veto should be
retained as any steps going beyond mere discussion or pro-
cedural preliminaries might initiate a " chain of events" which
the end could or should require the Security Council to take
enforcement action, and that such action must naturally attract
the right of veto. The same Statement added that the Great

that the Security Council Resolution of April 9, 1965, authorising the United
Kingdom to take steps to prevent the arrival at Beira of vessels taking oil to the
Rhodesian regime, was invalid because of the abstention from voting of two
permanent members, _see_ Cryer, Australian Year Book of International Law,
1966, at pp. 95--96.

Powers would not use their powers "wilfully" to obstruct the
operations of the Security Council. Undoubtedly as the veto
has been used, Security Council procedure has been stultified,
and attempts have been made to find ways to liberalise the
voting practice, while keeping within the limits of the principles
justifying the veto. It is clear that the following are subject to
the right of exercise of the veto :---

(a) the actual decision
whether a question to be put to the vote is one of procedure or
of substance;1 (b) any executive action; (c) a decision to carry
out any wide investigation of a dispute. But the mere pre-
liminary discussion of a subject, decisions on purely preliminary
points, and the hearing of statements by a State party to a
dispute would not be within the scope of the veto. Perhaps it
is well to remember also that the veto is not the main obstacle
to the Security Council reaching its full stature as an organ for
maintaining peace and security. Even if there were no veto,
it is probable that some alternative methods of obstructing the
Security Council's work would have been resorted to, leading
to equal abuses and absurdities, or that, as occurred in the
League of Nations, certain Powers might have quitted the
Organisation.
Powers and Functions of the Security Council
The Security Council has been given primary responsibility
under the Charter for maintaining peace and security, in order
that as a smaller executive body with a permanent core of
membership of the Great Powers, it can take effective decisions
to ensure prompt action by the United Nations. Under
Article 25 of the Charter, the Member States agree to abide by
and to carry out the Security Council's decisions. Although
1 The so-called double veto arises if a permanent member should
veto such a decision. However, on at least one occasion, the " double veto
was ousted, the President of the Security Council ruling the matter to be
procedural; _see_ Stone, Legal Controls of International Conflict (1954),
pp. 224--225 and Supplement 1953--1958 (1959), p. 870.
2 On September 8, 1959, the President of the Security Council ruled (against
protest by the representative of the Soviet Union) that the appointment of a
sub-committee to examine statements concerning Laos, etc., being for the
establishment of a subsidiary organ under Article 29 of the Charter, was a
procedural matter. He also ruled that the draft Resolution to determine
whether the question of this appointment was procedural, was not subject to
the veto (thereby excluding the double veto ").

Part 6.-International Institutions
the Security Council has primary responsibility for maintaining
peace and security, this responsibility is not exclusive. The
General Assembly has powers of discussion and recommenda-
tion in regard to the subject, and action may be taken under
regional arrangements or by regional agencies (_see_ Articles 52--53
of the Charter). Nor should it be forgotten that, generally
speaking, action by the Security Council must be brought within
the four corners of a particular Article or particular Articles in
Chapters VI or VII of the Charter, and even then because of
the " veto" or other voting disagreement no action may be
decided upon. On the other hand, on one view, the Security
Council has general overriding powers for maintaining peace
and security, not limited to the specific express powers in
Chapters VI or VII, as like other international organs, it has
such implied powers as are necessary and requisite for the
proper fulfilment of its functions. If this view be correct, the
Security Council could take action even on a matter which did
not come within the express terms of Chapters VI or VII.2
The principal powers and functions of the Security Council
relate to the following matters:---


(i) the pacific settlement
of international disputes; (ii) preventive or enforcement
action to maintain peace and security; (iii) regional agencies
and regional agreements; (iv) the control and supervision of
trust territories classified as "strategic areas (_see_ Chapter 5
above); (v) the admission, suspension and expulsion of
Members (_see above_); (vi) amendments to the Charter (_see_
Articles 108--9); (vii) the election in conjunction with the
General Assembly, of the fifteen Judges of the International
Court of Justice.
In relation to (i) above, the pacific settlement of disputes,
the powers of the Security Council as provided for in
Chapter VI of the Charter are as follows:---
-

(a) The Security Council "shall when it deems necessary "
call on the parties to a dispute, the continuance of which is
likely to endanger peace and security, to settle that dispute by

611
negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration,
judicial settlement, action by regional agencies or under
regional arrangements, or other peaceful means (Article 33). 1
But if the parties fail to settle it by these means-no time limit
for such failure is indicated--whether at the request of the
Security Council or otherwise, they must refer the dispute to
the Security Council. Thereupon, if the Security Council deems
that the continuance of the dispute is in fact likely to endanger
peace and security it shall decide:---

(1) whether to recommend
" appropriate procedures or methods " of settlement, or (2)
whether to recommend actual terms of settlement (Article 37).

(b) The Security Council may investigate not only any kind
of dispute, but also" situations "which are such that they may
lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute, in order
to determine whether the dispute or " situation" is likely to
endanger peace and security (Article 34). This investigation
is a preliminary to further action by the Security Council.
Such disputes or "situations " may be investigated by the
Security Council of its own motion, or be brought to its
attention by Member States of the United Nations (whether
parties or not to the dispute), or by non-Member States which
are parties to the dispute (Article 35), or by the General
Assembly (Article 11, paragraph 3), or by the Secretary-
General under his power to bring to the Security Council's
notice any "matter " which in his opinion threatens the
maintenance of peace and security (Article 99).

(c) During the course of any dispute or situation, the con-
tinuance of which is likely to endanger peace and security, the
Security Council may recommend " appropriate procedures or
methods" of settlement. In general, legal disputes are to
be referred to the International Court of Justice (Article 36).

(d) If all the parties to any such dispute so request, the
Security Council may recommend terms of peaceful settlement
(Article 38).
Under Article 33, it is the duty of parties to such a dispute to seek a
peaceful solution by these means.
The words " which might lead to international friction or give rise to a
dispute " in Article 34 qualify the word "situation ", and not the word
" dispute "; _see_ Hasluck, Workshop of Security (1948), at pp. 43--44.

------
612
Part 6.--International Institutions
>
There are several points in connection with the Security
Council's powers of settling disputes that call for comment.
First, its powers of calling upon the parties to settle disputes
by peaceful means (Article 33) or of recommending procedures
or methods of adjustment (Article 36) or of recommending
terms of settlement (Articles 37 and 38) are recommendatory
only, and limited to disputes which are likely to endanger
peace and security. It has no such powers with regard to all
disputes, although it may investigate any dispute to see if it is
likely to endanger peace and security (Article 34). Whether,
apart from Chapter VI of the Charter, it has any powers at all
with regard to disputes in general is an open question. Secondly,
a not very clear or happy distinction is drawn between" dis-
putes " and " situations (note that a " situation" is not
mentioned in Article 27, paragraph 3, as to voting). The
Security Council can under Article 34 investigate" situations
which may lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute
to see if they are likely to endanger peace and security, but its
only other express power with regard to a " situation" is
the power under Article 36 of recommending procedures or
methods of adjustment for a "situation " likely to endanger
peace and security. Who determines whether the circum-
stances amount to a "dispute" or a " situation "? Sometimes
disputes" and "situations" overlap, and a "situation"
may itself be in the nature of a " dispute". Is this a matter
for the Security Council to decide ? On several occasions
rulings as to the question have been given by the Chairman of
the Security Council, although it has been suggested that
whether a matter is a " dispute " or a " situation " depends
on the terms of the complaint bringing it to the Security
Council's notice. Thirdly, what are the circumstances which
66
1 Article 32 of the Charter, under which a non-member of the Security
Council, party to a dispute under consideration by the Council, may be invited
to participate in the discussion, does not apply to a " situation "; _see_ Advisory
Opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences for
States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West
Africa), June 21, 1971 (South Africa not invited to the discussion by the
Council in 1970 of the " situation" in South West Africa; decision by Council
that South Africa's continued presence there was illegal); sec I.C.J. Reports,
1971, 16, at pp. 22--23.

------
Chap. 19.--International Institutions
613
constitute a "dispute"? Certain of the cases that have come
before the Security Council are quite unlike text-book disputes,
i.e., clear differences between States over a contested issue,
being rather complaints over situations seemingly of remote
concern to the complainant State (for example, the Ukrainian
complaint in 1946 as to conditions in Greece). Generally
speaking, the Security Council has determined what specific
acts in regard to the settlement of disputes come within its
powers under the Charter, as, for example, in the case of
Trieste in 1946--7 when it accepted the responsibility of appoint-
ing a Governor. 1
The more important responsibilities of the Security Council
arise with reference to (ii), preventive or enforcement action
under Chapter VII. The Security Council is empowered to
determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of
the peace, or act of aggression and to make recommendations
or decide what enforcement measures are to be taken to
maintain or restore peace and security (Article 39). It may
call
on the parties involved to comply with provisional measures, and
take account of any failure to comply therewith (Article 40).
There are two kinds of enforcement action which can be
decided by the Security Council:---

(1) Measures not involving
the use of armed force. The Security Council may call upon
Member States to apply complete or partial interruption of
economic relations, and of all means of communication, and to
sever diplomatic relations. (2) Action by air, sea, or land
forces where the measures under (1) are inadequate. This
may involve a blockade of one of the parties concerned. The
Security Council may decide whether the action necessary to
carry out its enforcement decisions is to be taken by all or
some Member States only, and to mitigate any possible hard-
ships, Member States are to co-operate mutually in carrying
out the Security Council decisions (Articles 48--49). Also, if
any Member or non-Member is faced with special economic
problems arising from carrying out the preventive or enforce-
ment action decided upon, it has the right to consult the
Council on these (Article 50).

These far-reaching powers of the Security Council have to
be considered in conjunction with other provisions in
Chapter VII of the Charter, namely, those providing for a
Military Staff Committee composed of the Chiefs of Staff of the
five permanent members, to advise and assist the Security
Council on the military aspects of enforcement action (as well
as on disarmament and armament regulation). In addition
Article 43 provides for agreements between the Security Council
and Member States as to the armed forces and other assistance
they can make available for enforcement action; this provision
so far as concerns the armed assistance, etc., to be furnished to
the Security Council has not yet been carried into execution
although the Military Staff Committee has been considering
principles and methods in this connection. The result is that
the Security Council has not yet the necessary concrete basis
for acting in a decisive manner with the aid of Member States
and the Military Staff Committee, as intended by the provisions
of Chapter VII of the Charter. However, as shown below,
this was deemed not to preclude it, in the case of the Korean
conflict and of the Congo situation, from validly authorising
measures, with a view to restoring or maintaining international
peace and security.1
Although Member States of the United Nations are entitled
to defend themselves individually or collectively against an
armed attack, this right of self-defence is not to impair the
primary authority and responsibility of the Security Council for
enforcement action to maintain or restore peace (Article 51). 2
In its Advisory Opinion of June 21, 1971, on the Legal
Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South
Africa in Namibia (South West Africa), the International Court
of Justice ruled that the Security Council's primary authority

  : It was contended by Russia and certain other States that the North
  Atlantic Pact of 1949 was a violation of the Charter in that it permitted
  joint military action without the authority of the Security Council. In answer
  to this the signatories of the Pact stated that it was an agreement enabling the
  parties to co-ordinate beforehand plans for self-defence under Article 51.

and responsibility for maintaining peace entitled the Council to
make a binding determination (as it did in a Resolution in 1970)
that the continued presence of South Africa in the Territory of
South West Africa was illegal because its mandate for the
Territory had terminated through failure to comply with its
obligation to submit to the supervision of United Nations
organs; _see_ I.C.J. Reports, 1971, 16, at p. 54.
The question may be asked--are there any legal or practical
limitations on the Security Council's far-reaching powers
under the Charter ? Legal limitations are those in Articles 1
and 2 of the Charter concerning the " Purposes and
" Principles " of the United Nations; for example, the adjust-
ment or settlement of international disputes that may lead to a
breach of the peace is to be brought about by" peaceful means,
and in conformity with the principles of justice and inter-
national law" (Article 1), and apart from enforcement action,
the United Nations is not to intervene in matters " essentially
within the domestic jurisdiction of any State" (Article 2).
But even such legal limitations have to be adjusted to the
circumstances; for instance the Security Council has in
practice adopted the view that questions will cease to be
essentially" matters of domestic jurisdiction if in its opinion
they raise issues of international concern transcending State
boundaries.1 As to practical limitations on its powers, in
addition to the " veto ", there is the limitation that every
decision depends on receiving the agreement of a proportion
of the members.
Other important duties fall upon the Security Council under
Chapter VIII of the Charter in connection with regional
agencies and regional arrangements (_see_ (iii) above).2 It is
to encourage the pacific settlement of local disputes by such
means (Article 52), and where appropriate may use these

3 The Soviet Union maintained that the North Atlantic Pact of 1949 was
not a true regional agreement under Chapter VIII inasmuch as:---

(a) it com-
prised States located in two continents, America and Europe; and (b) it did
not relate to true regional questions. The United States Government de-
clared that the Pact was no different from the inter-American Security Arrange-
ments of 1945 (Mexico City), 1947 (Rio de Janeiro), and 1948 (Bogotá) which
are consistent with Chapter VIII.

Part 6.--International Institutions
means for enforcement action under its authority. Generally
speaking no enforcement action is to be taken by regional
agencies or under regional arrangements without the authority
of the Security Council except in regard to ex-enemy States. To
preserve its primary authority, all action taken or intended to be
taken under regionalarrangementsor by regionalagencies to main-
tain peace and security is to be reported to the Security Council.
The Korean Conflict, the Congo and Rhodesian Situation, and
the Security Council
The Korean conflict, 1950--1953, provided a significant
testing-ground of the Security Council's effectiveness as a
peace enforcement body. At the time that there occurred
the crossing by North Korean troops into South Korean
territory in June, 1950, the Soviet Union was absent from the
Security Council, and the Nationalist Chinese Government, to
whose credentials the Soviet Union objected, was represented
on the Security Council. Hence the subsequent Security
Council Resolutions, finding that a "breach of the peace
had been committed, recommending assistance to the South
Korean authorities, and providing for a Unified United Nations
Command under United States direction, were taken without
the Soviet's Union's concurrence. The Resolutions did,
however, receive the supporting vote of Nationalist China.
The Soviet Union challenged the validity of the Resolutions
on the ground that any such vote thereon required her positive
concurrence under the voting provisions of the Charter, and
also the concurrence of the Government of the People's
Republic of China, which was in its view the true legal Govern-
ment. In reply to the Soviet Union's contention, it was main-
tained that for purposes of determining whether the Soviet
Union had or had not concurred, an absence had necessarily
to be disregarded in the same way as, in practice, an abstention
from voting, and that the Chinese Nationalist Government
rightly represented China.

617
a
The subsequent reappearance of the Soviet Union in the
Security Council proved that United Nations intervention in the
Korean hostilities had been made possible only by an unusual
conjunction of circumstances-a situation favouring the
non-exercise of the "veto", the presence of American troops
in Japan, and the possibility of appointing an American Staff
in command of United Nations forces. Moreover, upon a
close analysis of their terms, the Security Council Resolutions
actually adopted were difficult to support as being a valid
exercise of the powers conferred by Articles 39--43 of the
Charter (quaere, e.g., whether the Security Council could make
"recommendation",1 as distinct from a decision, that
Member States furnish armed assistance). For this reason,
some writers have inclined to the view that the "United
Nations" action in Korea was such in name only, but not in
substance, and was nothing more than a voluntary, collective
effort under United Nations licence to restore and maintain
peace and security in that area.
In the case of the Congo situation, 1960--1964, the Security
Council's action was without precedent. It resulted in the
despatch of a United Nations Force to the newly independent
Congo, not by way specifically of enforcement action against a
State under Chapter VII of the Charter, but as military assis-
tance for the purpose of preserving law and order in relation
to, and pending the withdrawal of Belgian troops, as called for
by the Security Council's Resolutions. After the Belgian
troops had been withdrawn, the United Nations Force was
maintained in the Congo for the same purpose, and more
particularly in order to prevent the occurrence of civil war and
to reduce inter-tribal fighting. Primary responsibility for
carrying out the Security Council's mandate fell upon the
Secretary-General. The basis of the Security Council's action
was primarily that the internal strife in the Congo might, in
the absence of such action, deteriorate into a threat to inter-

national peace. Thus, it would seem, although this is not
undisputed, that the Security Council (as also the General
Assembly?) may authorise measures with a view to maintaining
international peace and security, notwithstanding that these
measures do not strictly fall within the pattern of enforcement
action under Chapter VII', and without the necessity of
explicit adherence to the procedural requirements of the
provisions in the Chapter.
However, in 1962--1963, the operations of the United Nations
units in the Congo, involving the clearing of road blocks and
the establishment of effective control in the Katanga area,
assumed the character of veritable military enforcement
measures; this action has been regarded by some commen-
tators as going beyond the scope of the role merely of" peace-
keeping" and/or "policing", which was thought to be
envisaged by the earlier Security Council Resolutions. The
Congo cannot be regarded as a very clear case of the inter-
pretation and application of the provisions of Chapter VII
of the Charter, and remains controversial.
In the case of the Rhodesian situation, in 1965 and following
years, there were initially three important Security Council
Resolutions directed against the Rhodesian regime, established
by unilateral declaration of independence from the United
Kingdom. There were two Resolutions, to begin with, for so-
called "voluntary" sanctions of enforcement action, namely
those Resolutions adopted in November, 1965 (of a general

nature) and April, 1966 (more specific in character, and, inter
alia, empowering the British Government to take steps" by the
use of force if necessary" to prevent ships taking oil to ports
from which it could be supplied or distributed to Rhodesia).
The third Resolution was that adopted in December, 1966 for
selective" mandatory" sanctions? (although there was no
specific provision for enforcement if a State failed to
apply them); this was indeed the first time that mandatory
enforcement action had been decided upon by the Security
Council. The situation constituted by the self-declared
independent regime was declared to be a threat to international
peace and security;: there appears to be little doubt about the
legitimacy of this determination, which was one that was
within the province of the Security Council to make, although
there can be arguments, as in the Korean case, with regard to
the applicability of the terms of Articles 39--43 of the Charter.
The vital point remains whether a situation, in a large sense
within the domestic sphere, since it turned so much on the
relationship of the new regime with the United Kingdom, is
_stricto sensu_ one within the ambit of Chapter VII of the Charter.
There persists the uneasy thought that the gates are being opened
wider than contemplated by those who originally drafted
Chapter VII of the Charter; e.g., quaere whether parent
governments can activate the Security Council to take enforce-
ment action against insurgents, or whether a federal government
could similarly approach the Council for measures to be taken
against a unilateraliy seceding State, where, of course, there are
circumstances somewhat similar to the situation in Rhodesia.
1 This was indeed the first time that the Security Council had made such a
grant of authority to a single United Nations member to take forcible action,
which would otherwise be unlawful. _See_ generally Cryer, " Legal Aspects of
the Joanna V and Manuela Incidents, April 1966", Australian Year Book of
International Law, 1966, pp. 97--98.
2 These included prohibition of the import of certain products and com-
modities from Rhodesia, and action to prevent certain exports and transfers
of funds to Rhodesia, and as well the supply of armaments, aircraft, and motor
vehicles. The Resolution made specific reference to Articles 39 and 41 of the
Charter.
3 According to one view, this threat lay in the possibility of violent action by
African States against Rhodesia, because of the treatment by the Rhodesian
regime of the majority African population.

Part 6.-International Institutions
United Nations " Peacekeeping
The word " peacekeeping" is not used in the United Nations
Charter, yet in the last five years the " peacekeeping " concept
has emerged to receive as much attention as any other current or
projected programme of United Nations action. A Special
Committee on Peace-Keeping Operations has met in pursuance
of a General Assembly Resolution of February 18, 1965 for
the making of " a comprehensive review of the whole question
of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects". The use of
the word "peacekeeping" seems somewhat unfortunate. To
be more precise, the issues involved are in what circumstances,
in the absence of Security Council enforcement action, inter-
position forces, groups, or missions can be sent by the United
Nations to areas of conflict, with functions related to the
restoration or maintenance of peace, or the mitigation of
deteriorating situations (e.g., for observation, truce supervision
purposes, negotiation, restoring freedom of movement)."
Clearly any such interposition, where the Security Council
has made no determination, is dependent upon the consent of
the States concerned, as to the locality where the force, etc., is
to function, as to the importation of supplies, and as to contacts
with the conflicting entities or forces. The Security Council has
alone, under the Charter, executive responsibility to establish
and operate a force compulsorily in the territory of a Member
State. According to the Secretary-General of the United
Nations, no peace keeping operation" could function or even
exist without the continuing consent and co-operation of the
host country" (_see_ document S/7906, May 26, 1967). This
was the principal justification for the withdrawal of the United
Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) from Egyptian territory,
prior to the Israeli-Arab hostilities of June 5--10, 1967, although
for other reasons (e.g., the applicability of a "good faith "

Truce Supervision Organisation in Palestine, the U.N. Force in Cyprus, the
U.N. Mission in the Dominican Republic (established in May, 1965), and

exhaust the variety of the tasks which are contemplated by the protagonists of
U.N. peacekeeping.

accord for the continued presence of UNEF), the withdrawal
has been the subject of controversy.
There continues to be a deep division of opinion among
Member States, resulting in two interdependent impasses, one
legal, and the other practical. Some countries are adamant
that peacekeeping must be confined within the scope of Security
Council action under Chapter VII; others hold that the
consensual character of peacekeeping enables authorisation by
the General Assembly or by the Secretary-General, within the
ambit of the wider purposes of the Charter. In any event, the
practical aspect of reliable financing of peacekeeping, in the
absence of readiness by all States to accept mandatory assess-
ments of contributions, is one that must be solved, even if the
controversy over the legal issue could be settled.
In the case of the peacekeeping forces in the Congo (ONUC)
and in Cyprus (UNFICYP), entrusted with functions of
maintaining law and order, difficulties were revealed with
reference to the observance of two necessary restraints upon a
peacekeeping force, namely, not to intervene in internal strife,
and as far as possible not to apply force beyond the necessities of
self-defence.
It can be seen that the peacekeeping concept is one beset with
endemic problems and difficulties.
The Economic and Social Council
This organ, operating under the authority of the General
Assembly, is concerned with promoting economic and social
progress and better standards of human welfare as well as the
observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The
United Nations Charter recognises that progress in these fields
is essential to maintain peaceful and friendly relations between
nations. The Economic and Social Council is composed of
twenty-sevent members elected by the General Assembly for
three years and eligible for re-election. Representatives of
any Member State or of the "specialised agencies
participate in its discussions without vote.

  ments to the Charter which took effect in 1965.

Its particular role with respect to the co-ordination of the
activities of the "specialised agencies " has already been
discussed in this chapter. Besides this part of its activities,
it initiates studies, surveys and reports on various economic,
social, health, and related matters, and prepares draft Con-
ventions for submission to the General Assembly on matters
within the scope of its powers, and is empowered to call
international conferences on these matters (Article 62 of the
Charter). It has also played a primary part in the organisation
of the programme of technical assistance for undeveloped
countries. All decisions are taken by a majority of the
members present and voting.
The Economic and Social Council's work is " sectionalised
through special Commissions of which four are regional
economic commissions concerned with special problems in
particular areas--Europe, Asia and the Far East, Africa, and
Latin America; the others, the so-called "Functional Com-
missions ", deal with particular subjects such as Human Rights,
Transport and Communications, Narcotic Drugs, Population,
and Status of Women.
Of the three other principal organs of the United Nations,
the Trusteeship Council and the International Court of Justice
have been discussed above, in Chapters 51 and 162 respectively,
and the Secretariat may now be referred to. The Secretariat
consists of the administrative staff of the United Nations,
and really represents an international civil service. Its chief
administrative officer is the Secretary-General, who is appointed
by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the
Security Council. The independent, international character of
the Secretariat is specially safeguarded by the provisions of
Articles 100--101 of the Charter, which are expressed to bind
both Member States and officials of the Secretariat.4

9.---THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION AND
OTHER " RELATED AGENCIES
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) was originally
created under Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles, 1919, but
subsequently, to dissociate the Organisation as far as possible
from the League of Nations and from the Treaty itself, this
section of the Treaty was detached, and its clauses renumbered,
and it emerged with the new title of the " Constitution of the
International Labour Organisation". This Constitution was
amended in 1945, 1946, 1953, 1962 and 1964. Formerly the
International Labour Organisation had some organic con-
nection with the League of Nations but that was altered by the
constitutional amendments of 1945 and 1946, and it is now a
specialised agency brought into relationship with the United
Nations by a special relationship agreement.
From the outset, the main object of the Organisation has
been to promote international co-operation in the sphere of
industry and labour so that economic competition between
States or other like conditions shall not militate against the
realisation of minimum as well as uniform labour standards
throughout the world. The Organisation's efforts are
principally directed to bringing the legislation and practice of
each State into line with the most enlightened modern con-
ceptions as to the treatment of labour, and with changing
economic and social conditions in each such country. The
idea of social justice underlying its work has been made more
manifest in the amendments to the Constitution of 1945 and
1946, and was given particular solemn expression in the Declara-
tion of Philadelphia adopted by the International Labour
Conference in 1944 and annexed to the Constitution. That
Declaration reaffirms the principles that labour is not a com-
modity, that freedom of expression and association are essential
to international progress, and that poverty is a danger to
prosperity, and it also recognises that the obligation of the
Organisation is to further among nations world programmes
designed to achieve full employment, higher standards of
living, the provision of facilities for the training and transfer of
labour, and the extension of social security measures.

------
624
Part 6.-International Institutions
The outstanding feature of the International Labour
Organisation is its tripartite character, as it is representative
in its organs of Governments, employers and employees.
The three main organs of the Organisation are:---

(1) The
International Labour Conference; (2) The Governing Body;

(3) The International Labour Office.
The International Labour Conference is a policy-making
and legislative body, being in effect a world industrial
Parliament". It consists of four representatives in respect of
each Member State, two representing the Government and
one each labour and management respectively in that country.
Voting is by a two-thirds majority. The Conference promotes
labour legislation in each State, by adopting:---

(a) Recom-
mendations; and (b) Conventions. A Recommendation
enunciates principles to guide a State in drafting labour
legislation or labour regulations, and for this reason has been
termed a "standard-defining instrument ".1 States, however,
are under no binding obligation to give effect to a Recom-
mendation, although they are duty bound to bring it before
the appropriate national legislative authority. A Convention
is in the nature of a treaty, although it is adopted by the
Conference and not signed by delegates of the Member States.
Primarily, it is conceived as a model for domestic legislation.
Member States are under an obligation to bring the Convention
before the competent authorities for the enactment of legislation
or other action (Article 19 of the Constitution). If a Member
State obtains approval for a Convention, it is bound to ratify it,
and thereupon assumes the obligation of applying its pro-
visions. Also that Member State is bound to report annually
on the measures it has taken to bring its legislation into accord
with the Convention.
The Governing Body is more or less the executive organ of
the Organisation. It has a similar tripartite character to that
of the Conference, being composed of forty-eight members,
twenty-four representing Governments (ten appointed by the
ten States of chief industrial importance, and fourteen elected
_See_ The International Labour Code (edition of 1939), published by the
International Labour Office, at p. xii.

------
Chap. 19--International Institutions
625
by delegates of Governments to the Conference, other than the
ten just mentioned), twelve representing management and
elected by the employers' delegates to the Conference, and
twelve representing labour and elected by the workers' dele-
gates to the Conference. The Governing Body appoints the
Director-General of the International Labour Office, and
supervises the work of the Office and of the various Committees
and Commissions.
The amendments of 1945 and 1946 to the Constitution were
made principally with a view to strengthening the provisions
for the application of Conventions adopted by the Conference,
to make the Organisation completely independent of League of
Nations machinery, and to enable it to co-operate more fully
with the United Nations and other international institutions.
This involved a thorough redrafting of Article 19 of the
Constitution concerning the obligations of Member States with
reference to Conventions and Recommendations, including the
addition of an obligation for Member States to report from
time to time on their relevant law and practice even where the
competent authorities had not approved of the instruments
submitted to them for approval and other action, and including
also more specific provisions as to the application of these
instruments within Federal States. Further by Article 19 of
the Constitution, the term " Convention " was substituted for
the former misleading term "Draft Convention ", and in
Article 13 provision was made for the independent financing of
the Organisation.
Besides Conventions and Recommendations, the Organisa-
tion has through its organs adopted less formal instruments to
express its policies; for example, resolutions, conclusions,
observations, and reports. Collectively all these instruments
form an International Labour Code embodying world standards
of labour policy. Other important features of the Organi-
sation's machinery are the provisions in Articles 24--25 of the
Constitution conferring on industrial associations of employers
and workers the right to make a representation to the Govern-
ing Body that a Member State has failed to observe effectively
a Convention binding it; several such representations have

------
626
Part 6.- International Institutions
been made. Then there is the procedure of complaint by
Member States set out in Articles 26 to 34; this may lead to the
appointment of a Commission of Inquiry and action against
the State not fulfilling its obligations, to induce it to comply
therewith.
The third organ of the International Labour Organisation,
the International Labour Office, represents the administrative
or civil service staff of the Organisation, discharging very
similar functions to those of the United Nations Secretariat.
In the last decade, the International Labour Organisation has
moved strongly into the field of technical assistance, manpower
organisation, and productivity and management development.
The " Related Agencies "
Besides the International Labour Organisation, there are the
various "related agencies", each corresponding to certain
aspects of world affairs demanding organic direction by a
specialised international administrative body. Thus the Food
and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)
is concerned with improving living standards and the nutrition
of peoples, and with promoting the increased production and
more efficient distribution of food and agricultural products.2
'1
1 The term " related agencies is used to cover not only the specialised
agencies, but an institution such as the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), which is not a specialised agency, but which has a working relation-
ship with the United Nations.
2 Considerations of space have precluded a detailed treatment of each of
the related agencies. However:---

(a) The sections in the present Chapter
dealing with the organic structure and composition of international institutions,
their integration and co-ordination, etc., have been expanded in order to
supply more detail as to the related agencies. (b) Much of the ground
that would have been covered in separate detailed analyses of each body
has already been included in the preceding portions of the Chapter. (c) There
is contained in the readily available and inexpensive publication Everyman's
United Nations, a concise treatment of each specialised agency, of the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and of the system of meetings of the
Contracting Parties under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) of October 30, 1947 to which a new Part IV (encouragement of
development of the less-developed countries) was added in February, 1965.
For more detailed information, the reader is referred to the Yearbook of the
United Nations (latest edition, 1968), and to the Constitutions of the agencies
related to the United Nations (_see_ the United Nations Treaty Series). _See also_

Chap. 19.-International Institutions
627
The field of education, culture, knowledge and science is
covered by the United Nations Educational Scientific and
Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the sphere of international
air navigation and air transport by the International Civil
Aviation Organisation (ICAO), international banking and
economic and monetary matters by the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, the International
Monetary Fund, and the newly affiliated International Finance
Corporation, international co-operation in matters of shipping,
navigation, and maritime safety by the Inter-Governmental
Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO), the organisation
and improvement of postal services throughout the world by
the Universal Postal Union (UPU), whose origins as an in-
stitution date back to 1874--5, and the peaceful uses of atomic
energy by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
established in 1956. Other bodies are the International Tele-
communication Union (ITU), the World Health Organisation
(WHO), and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO),
whose titles indicate the particular functions they perform.
As to such related agencies, it may be said in conclusion
that they have so far fulfilled two objects, implicit in their
establishment:---

(1) That, not only should they buttress and
give vitality to the United Nations, but that they should draw
strength from their association with the United Nations.

(2) To involve the national authorities of different States into
more direct and continuous association with the work of
international institutions.

of the subject.
The leading periodicals in English on international law are the American
Journal of International Law (quarterly), the International and Comparative
Law Quarterly, and the Year Book of World Affairs (London Institute of
World Affairs; this Year Book deals with both international affairs and
international law). These contain, in addition to articles and notes, the
reproduction of the texts of international documents, accounts of British
and American practice, and annotations and commentaries on significant
judicial or arbitral decisions. Mention may also be made of the Canadian
Yearbook of International Law (Annuaire canadien de Droit international)
and of the Australian Year Book of International Law, which are new-
comers from the Commonwealth to the field of the periodical literature of
international law. An important annual publication in India is the
Indian Year Book of International Affairs, the 1964 issue of which contained
a number of historical studies.
Leading and important foreign periodical publications include the
Annuaire Français de Droit International and Revue Générale de Droit
International (French), the Netherlands International Law Review, the
Soviet Year-Book of International Law (Soviet Association of Inter-
national Law), and the Japanese Annual of International Law.
Current, continuing compilations of legal documentary materials
include International Legal Materials, published bi-monthly (American
Society of International Law), and the United Nations Juridical Yearbook
(United Nations).

mentioned being particularly valuable for references to the Continental
literature.
A select bibliography on the law and practice of treaties is contained
in the United Nations publication, Laws and Practices concerning the
Conclusion of Treaties (1953), at pp. 141--189.
In the Yearbooks of the International Court of Justice (the latest is the
Yearbook, 1969--1970), there is much useful information concerning the
Court, its adjudications, and its functions generally. Prior to the Year-
book, 1964--1965, these annual volumes contained an extensive
bibliography of books, articles, and studies published concerning the
Court, but the bibliographies are now being published separately in
annual issues.

INTERNATIONAL
LAW REPORTS
Edited by E. LAUTERPACHT, Q.C.,
Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
This is the only series of reports to bring together
in English
the decisions of all international tribunals,
including the International Court of Justice
the European Court of Justice
the European Commission of Human Rights
various important Claims and Conciliation
Commissions.
the decisions of national courts bearing on
international law, including those applying the
European Community treaties, and decisions
from Africa, Asia, America (North and South)
and Europe.
There is no other comparable set of reports in
English or in any other language. Every effort is
made to gather here all the decisions which are
likely to be of value to the practitioner and to the
researcher in international law. With the growing
application of international law in international
and national courts, no investigation into an
international legal problem is complete without
reference to the relevant parts of the volumes of
the International Law Reports.
Further details of these and other publications can
be obtained on application to the publishers,
