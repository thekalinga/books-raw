## THE STATE AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS---INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND MONETARY LAW

Modern States exercise wide control over the economy,
including such aspects of private economic enterprise as the
export and import trade, internal and external investment,
shipping, agricultural production, and private banking. It is
only natural that they should enter into agreements with each
other to regulate _inter partes_ those economic and monetary
matters which affect two or more of them jointly. Most of
these agreements are bilateral, e.g. trade treaties, or treaties of
commerce and navigation, or treaties of establishment, but
there have been agreements of a more general character, including
the Articles of Agreement, respectively, of the International
Monetary Fund,[^365/1] of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development,[^365/1] and of the International
Finance Corporation,[^365/2] the Convention of March 18, 1965 on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States, the Treaty of Rome of March 25,
1957, establishing the European Economic Community, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of October 30
1947, the Constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO), and the international commodity agreements,
such as the Third International Tin Agreement of 1965, the
International Sugar Agreement 1968, the International Coffee
Agreement 1968, and the Arrangement of 1970 concerning
Certain Dairy Products.

There has thus developed a new field of the regulation of
international economic matters.[^366/1] The difficulty, however, is to
extract from all these numerous treaty provisions principles of
general application, which can truly be postulated as binding
rules of international law. It is really only possible to
indicate certain directions in which this treaty practice concerning
State economic interests is moving.

First, a principle appears to be taking shape, imposing upon
every State a duty not to institute discriminatory trade restrictions,
or discriminatory taxes or levies upon trade against
another State, unless genuinely justified by balance-of-payments
difficulties. There does not appear to be any distinction in this
connection between wilful and unintentional discrimination, as
it is sufficient if there be discrimination _de facto_. In either
event, as the practice of the Contracting Parties to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), p. 365, _ante_, shows,
it is the duty of States to correct or remove the element of
discrimination.

Unfortunately, there is bound to be controversy as to what
constitutes a discrimination. If under a trade treaty between
State A and State B, the parties agree to grant to each other
special reciprocal State privileges, e.g. by way of reduced
customs duties, is State X entitled to complain of discrimination
if goods exported from its territory to these States continue to
be subject to the former amount of duty ? If State X were a
party to a treaty with these States, providing for most-favoured-nation
treatment, the inequality of customs privileges would
clearly amount to discrimination. [^366/2]In the absence of any such
treaty with a most-favoured-nation clause or obligation, it is
difficult to accept the view that the grant of reciprocal trade
privileges between two States _inter partes_ can represent a discrimination
as against a third State, and the decision of the
Permanent Court of International Justice in the Oscar Chinn
Case[^367/1] provides persuasive authority against such a view. It
was the object of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
_supra_, to extend the most-favoured-nation obligation,[^367/2] so as to
ensure non-discrimination generally in customs and taxation
matters (_see_ Article I).

Second, insofar as private foreign investment is concerned,
there is emerging a principle that the State in which such
investment is made should not by its exchange control laws
and regulations hamper or prevent the payment of profits or
income to the foreign investors, or the repatriation of the
capital invested (although there is no absolute or unconditional
right to repatriate capital), unless :---

(a) such restrictions
are essential for the maintenance of monetary reserves;
or

(b) _semble_, the restrictions are temporarily necessary for
reasons of the health and welfare of the people of the country
of investment. Any such restrictions should also be non-discriminatory.[^367/3]

With regard to the entry of capital, although
the general trend of international law is towards the promotion
of investment, investment-receiving States are not debarred
from prescribing requirements for the screening, approval, and
registration of any capital inflow.[^367/4]

A number of proposals have been made in recent years for
the protection and encouragement of private foreign investment,
including a suggested international Convention defining
the fundamental mutual rights of private foreign investors and
capital-importing countries,[^368/1] a project for an international
investments tribunal, and a code of multilateral investment
insurance. These proposals provided the background for the
first major step taken in investment protection under international
law, namely the above-mentioned Convention of
March 18, 1965 for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States, setting up
international conciliation and arbitration machinery on a
consensual basis so that private foreign investors might have
direct access thereto to settle legal disputes with investment-receiving
States.

However, as pointed out by the International Court of
Justice in the Barcelona Traction Case,[^368/2] one overriding general
principle is that an investment-receiving State, while bound to
extend some protection in law to the investments concerned,
does not thereby become an insurer of that part of the investing
State's wealth corresponding to such investments. Certain
risks must remain.

Third, the above-mentioned international commodity agreements
indicate a movement towards rules of international law,
obliging producing and purchasing States to co-operate in
ensuring the stability of commodity prices, and in equating
supply with demand. Negatively, they show that there is no
rule of international law, which prevents a State from restricting
production, having regard to economic exigencies. However,
as a different regulatory system is followed by the contracting
States in each of the commodity agreements, lack of uniformity
precludes the drawing of any more general conclusions.

Fourth, there appears to be an emerging principle[^368/3] that
States should avoid practices such as dumping and the unrestricted
disposal of accumulated stocks that may interfere with
the industrial development of the so-called "developing"
countries (i.e. those which not being highly developed or
industrialised, are in process of developing mainly an industrial
economy). This principle is no doubt merely a particular
illustration of the rule of economic good neighbourliness which
should be followed by all States; it underlies the basic purposes
of the International Monetary Fund and of the Meetings of the
Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (p. 365), that the growth of international trade should be
facilitated in order to contribute to the promotion of full
employment and the development of national productivity.
In general, States taking measures for their own economic
protection should have regard to the possible harmful effects
upon the economies of other States.[^369/1]

Fifth, international law is moving towards the abolition of
quantitative restrictions on imports and exports, except where
these are temporarily and urgently required to solve problems
of maintenance of currency reserves (_see_ Articles XI to XIV of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, _supra_).

Sixth, States appear ready to recognise a principle that in
matters not materially involving the revenue, or balance-of-payments
issues, customs formalities should be simplified, and
administrative restrictions on, or barriers to trade should be
minimised. This is illustrated not only by the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (p. 365), but by Conventions such as
the International Convention to Facilitate Importation of
Commercial Samples and Advertising Material signed at
Geneva on November 7, 1952, and more recently by the
Resolution of December 20, 1965 of the United Nations
General Assembly favouring the "progressive unification and
harmonisation of the law of international trade", and the
betterment of conditions to facilitate trade.

Seventh, the principle that the developing (or under-developed)
countries are entitled to special economic assistance is
firmly established, and is reflected in the provisions of the new
Part IV, added by the Protocol of February 8, 1965 to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, referred to _supra_, and
in the current work of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD).[^370/1] Indeed, it may be
said that by way of exception to the concept of development of
free and open trading relationships, the extension of new
preferences, subject to consultation with the countries significantly
affected, as an expedient for encouraging the export of
selected products from less-developed countries, is not excluded
by any general rules of international law; this seems to be
shown by the "waivers" granted by the GATT Contracting
Parties in 1966 and 1971 to enable Australia and other developed
countries to grant tariff preferences to under-developed
States, and in the steps taken by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1970--1971 to
procure the introduction of a generalised system of trade
preferences in favour of developing countries, so as to increase
their export earnings and make possible further economic
development, preferences being in this case an instrument for
promoting rather than for restricting trade.

In this matter of consultation, it may be added that economic
good-neighbourliness makes it incumbent upon States to
consult with each other, and to be accessible for the receipt of
representations, in connection with the application of the
above-mentioned principles.[^370/2] All this is however expressed or
implied in the provisions of the Articles of Agreement of the
International Monetary Fund, of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, and of other multilateral and bilateral
instruments.

These are among the evolving principles of international
economic law of general significance, and they embrace only a
limited field, leaving a whole range of international economic
questions not even subject to emergent doctrines.

Apart from these areas of tentative acceptance, there are a
number of growing international economic doctrines, e.g., the
promotion by international action of policies conducive to
balanced economic growth, and the obligation on a State, in
technical economic terms, to keep demand at an appropriate
level and to graduate national expenditure in line with the
growth of production, that may be yet translated into ruling
principles of international law. It would however be bold to
predict that this will take place in the very near future.

### International Monetary Law

International monetary law consists of the complex of
international rules and guidelines which have been created,
largely upon the basis of traditional banking and trading
practices, in an effort to ensure fair and efficient methods of
conducting international financial transactions. It includes,
for example, the following :---

(a) the rules and principles
constituting the par value system, embodied in the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
referred to, _ante_, under which each State party maintains a
fixed value of its currency relative to gold and other currencies,
with alteration of the value being confined to circumstances of
fundamental disequilibrium, and generally requiring the prior
consent of the Fund;

(b) the provisions of the Articles of
Agreement of the Fund and of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), under which restrictions on trade
and on current payments are generally allowable only in
situations of balance-of-payments difficulties and are subjected
to international control;

(c) the provisions of the Articles of
Agreement of the Fund, and related arrangements and practices,
designed to foster the interconvertibility of currencies;

(d) the _de facto_ arrangements implementing the above-mentioned
rules, and serving to preserve monetary stability. One
of the keystones of the system is the International Monetary
Fund which has worked well within the main important areas
for which it was designed, that is to say, avoidance of discriminatory
currency arrangements, reasonable exchange
stability for the purpose of international trading, the elimination
of competitive exchange depreciation, and the promotion
of international monetary co-operation.

However, it is not to be doubted that international monetary
law is now very much at the cross-roads. The gold crisis in
March, 1968, the dollar-mark crisis in Western Europe in
April-May, 1971, and the crisis in August, 1971, arising out of
the United States Government's decision to cease conversion
into gold of foreign-held dollars, have demonstrated the
fragility of the system. The magnitude and velocity of arrival
of each of these crises served to underscore the weaknesses
in the rules, and the need for revision and recasting. But the
international community has not been prepared to undertake
any drastic restructuring of international monetary law; this
was shown in the introduction in 1968--1969 of the so-called
"two-tier" system for gold transactions, and of the Special
Drawing Rights Facility as a measure for relieving the problem
of international liquidity.[^372/1] It could hardly have been expected
that these arrangements would become firm additions to the
general rules of international monetary law.

The problem remains of the mechanism of exchange rate
adjustment, which has failed from time to time to withstand
unforeseen pressures. The International Monetary Fund
system, sometimes known as the "adjustable-peg" system,
represents a compromise between fixed and flexible exchange
rates. There are two opposing views as to its advantages and
disadvantages. On the one hand, there are those who maintain
that, as soon as national economies come out of alignment
by reason of different degrees of inflation and economic
productivity, exchange rates are thrown out of gear and
financial crises occur, giving rise to urgent demands for additional
liquidity, and encouraging movements of capital,
partly speculative, and partly conditioned by a natural desire
to obtain security or a higher return. It is further said that the
system could not work effectively, if it were not for practices
such as stringent action to reduce excess of internal spending,
and the increasing recourse to transactions by way of "Euro-dollars"
("Euro-dollars" are in effect no more than the dollar
liabilities of banks in certain Western European countries,
including the United Kingdom). It is accordingly claimed
that the rules should be changed so as to permit variations of
exchange rates within a wider band, or with allowance for wider
margins. On the other hand, the opponents of flexing of
exchange rates contend that the present system has served to
encourage the growth of world trade and exchanges of capital,
and that a new trend to flexibility would lead to such uncertainties
as to endanger such volume of trade and investment
as now prevails.

[^366/1]: The importance of this field of regulation of international economic
matters was recognised by the United Nations General Assembly in its
Resolution of December 17, 1966, establishing the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law with the functions, _inter alia_, of harmonising
and unifying the law of international trade, promoting wider

notwithstanding erosions under recent developments, still governs a large
part of the world trade, has been under study by the International Law Commission.
At its 1968 Session, the Commission reached the conclusion that the
study should not be confined to the role of the clause in international trade,
but should cover the whole area of the practical application of the clause,
regarded as a legal institution of an extensive nature, with impact, upon matters
such as rights of establishment, and land-holding by aliens. _See_ Report of
Commission on Work of its Twentieth Session (1968), paragraph 93.

Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), established in 1961, as a
permanent institution for the harmonisation of national economic policies,
with the express purpose of making available to its members all knowledge
relevant to the formulation of rational policy in every economic field, and of
sharing experiences through meetings at Ministerial and official levels.
