## THE STATE AND THE INDIVIDUAL

## NATIONALITY

Nationality is the most frequent and sometimes the only
link between an individual and a State, ensuring that effect
be given to that individual's rights and obligations at international
law. It may be defined as the status of membership
of the collectivity of individuals whose acts, decisions, and
policy are vouchsafed through the legal concept of the State
representing those individuals. One of the best passages
descriptive of the status is that contained in the judgment of
the British-Mexican Claims Commission in Re Lynch.[^336/1]

> A man's nationality forms a continuing state of things and
not a physical fact which occurs at a particular moment. A
man's nationality is a continuing legal relationship between the
sovereign State on the one hand and the citizen on the other.
The fundamental basis of a man's nationality is his membership
of an independent political community. This legal relationship
involves rights and corresponding duties upon both---on the
part of the citizen no less than on the part of the State.

Most of the rules as to nationality are the sole concern of
municipal law. It has long been conceded that it is the prerogative
of each State to "determine for itself, and according
to its own constitution and laws what classes of persons shall
be entitled to its citizenship".[^336/2]

Under changes in 1948 to the legislation of each of the
Member States of the British Commonwealth, the law as to
British nationality was revised.[^337/1] Each Member State has its
own "citizens" (i.e., nationals), but in addition there is the
status of British "subject" which denotes membership of this
Commonwealth and comprises certain privileges. The
terminology may, perhaps, cause confusion.

Varied indeed are the different rules on nationality found
in State laws, this lack of uniformity being most manifest in
the divergencies relating to original acquisition of nationality.
Thus the laws of one group of States provide that a person's
nationality is determined by that of his parents at birth (jus
sanguinis), thuse of a second group equally by parentage (jus
sanguinis) and by the State of the territory of birth (jus soli),
those of a third group principally by parentage (jus sanguinis)
and partly by the State of territory of birth (jus soli), and those
of a fourth group principally by the State of territory of birth
(jus soli) and partly by parentage (jus sanguinis).

The lack of uniformity in State nationality laws has resulted
in troublesome problems of multiple nationality, statelessness,
and disputed nationality of married women. An attempt to
cope with such problems was made in 1930, when the Hague
Codification Conference adopted a Convention on the Conflict
of Nationality Laws, two ancillary Protocols on, respectively,
Military Obligations and Double Nationality, and a Certain
Case of Statelessness, and a Special Protocol with regard to
Statelessness. More recent instruments are the Convention on
the Nationality of Married Women opened for signature on
February 20, 1957, and the Convention on the Reduction of
Statelessness of August 30, 1961.

Nationality should be distinguished from the following :---

(a) Race.

(b) Membership or citizenship of the States or provinces of
a Federation. This local citizenship falls short of the international
status of nationality, although it may entitle the
holder eventually to claim these fuller and wider rights.

(c) The right to diplomatic protection. For example, under
United States law and practice many persons enjoy a right to
protection without being American subjects.[^338/1] Similarly, it has
been held that French protected subjects do not necessarily
become French nationals.[^338/2]

(d) Rights of citizenship, which may be denied to persons
who are nationals. Disabilities in citizenship, even of a serious
nature, do not involve loss of nationality. This is shown by
the case of Kahane v. Parisi and the Austrian State[^338/3] where it was
held that Jews in Rumania who were denied many privileges
and subjected to many severe restrictions were none the less
Rumanian nationals.

(e) The status of British "subject" under the British
Nationality Act, 1948, and cognate Commonwealth legislation
(_see above_).

### International Importance of Nationality

It is always material to know of which State a particular
person is a national. The reason is that nationality has various
important incidents at international law :---

(i) The right to diplomatic protection abroad is an essential
attribute of nationality. We have already seen that in
questions of State responsibility, it is regarded as a vital right
of each State that it should be entitled to protect its subjects
abroad. The English common law conception of nationality
coincides with this principle; as early as Calvin's Case,[^338/4] it
was ruled that allegiance and protection were the correlative
aspects of nationality--- "Protectio trahit subjectionem et
subjectio protectionem".

(ii) The State of which a particular person is a national may
become responsible to another State if it has failed in its duty
of preventing certain wrongful acts committed by this person
or of punishing him after these wrongful acts are committed.[^339/1]

(iii) Generally, a State does not refuse to receive back on its
territory its own nationals.

(iv) Nationality imports allegiance, and one of the principal
incidents of allegiance is the duty to perform military service
for the State to which such allegiance is owed.

(v) A State has a general right to refuse to extradite its own
nationals to another State requesting surrender.

(vi) Enemy status in time of war may be determined by the
nationality of the person concerned.

(vii) States may frequently exercise criminal or other jurisdiction
on the basis of nationality.[^339/2]

Clearly difficulties may arise in many cases where the
nationality of a particular individual is in doubt. The
authorities have long established that the question is to be
decided by the municipal law of the State whose nationality
such person is alleged to possess; according to Russell, J., in
Stoeck v. Public Trustee[^339/3] :---

> The question of what State a person belongs to must ultimately
be decided by the municipal law of the State to which
he claims to belong or to which it is alleged that he belongs .

This principle is supported by Articles 1 and 2 of the Hague
Convention of 1930 on the Conflict of Nationality Laws.
These provisions are as follows :---

>Article 1. It is for each State to determine under its own
law who are its nationals. This law shall be recognised by
other States in so far as it is consistent with international
Conventions, international custom, and the principles of law
generally recognised with regard to nationality.
Article 2. Any question as to whether a person possesses
the nationality of a particular State shall be determined in
accordance with the law of that State"

It should be added that a duly authorised passport is _prima
facie_ evidence of nationality.[^340/1]

### Acquisition of Nationality

The practice of States shows that nationality may be acquired
in the following principal ways :---

(1) By birth either according to jus soli---the territory of
birth-or jus sanguinis------the nationality of the parents at birth
-or according to both.

(2) By naturalisation, either by marriage, as when a wife
assumes her husband's nationality, or by legitimation, or by
official grant of nationality on application to the State
authorities. According to the decision of the International
Court of Justice in the Nottebohm Case (Second Phase),[^340/2]
States are not under a duty to recognise a nationality acquired
by a person who has no genuine link or connection with the
naturalising State.

(3) The inhabitants of a subjugated or conquered or ceded
territory may assume the nationality of the conquering State,
or of the State to which the territory is ceded.[^340/3]

### Loss of Nationality

According to the practice of States, nationality may be
lost by :---

(1) Release, or renunciation, for example, by deed signed
and registered at a consulate, or by declaration of alienage
upon coming of age.

(2) Deprivation, for example, under special denationalisation
laws passed by the State of which the person concerned is a
national.[^340/4]

(3) Long residence abroad.

So far as both international law and municipal law are
concerned, there is a presumption against the loss of one
nationality that has been held for some time, and a heavy onus
of proof must be discharged before the loss is recognised.
For instance, by Article 7 of the Hague Convention of 1930
on the Conflict of Nationality Laws, the mere grant of an
expatriation permit is not to entail the loss of nationality of
the State issuing the permit. Under English law, an individual
seeking to establish loss of nationality of a particular State
must not merely satisfy the Court by positive evidence as to
the facts of the municipal law under which he alleges such
loss,[^341/1] but must also prove that nationality has been lost for
all purposes and with all its incidents, and any possibility that
a right of protection or a chance of resumption of nationality
still exists will prevent the onus being discharged.[^341/2]

### Double Nationality, Statelessness, and Nationality of Married Women

Owing to the conflict of nationality laws and their lack of
uniformity, it often arises that certain individuals possess
double nationality.[^341/3] A frequent instance is the case of a
woman who, marrying somebody not of her own nationality,
may retain her nationality according to the law of the State
of which she is a national and acquire the nationality of her
husband according to the law of the State of which her husband
is a national. Double nationality may also result from birth
in the territory of a State, not the State of which the parents
are nationals, although usually a minor is given a chance to
opt for one or the other nationality on the attainment of
his majority. A right of option, otherwise, may be conferred
by treaty.

Articles 3 to 6 of the Hague Convention of 1930 on the
Conflict of Nationality Laws deal with some difficulties arising
out of double nationality. Of particular importance is Article 5,
which provides that within a third State a person of more
than one nationality shall be treated as if he only had one
nationality, and such third State shall recognise exclusively
either :---

(a) the nationality of the country in which he is
habitually and principally resident, or

(b) the nationality of
the country with which in the circumstances he appears to be
in fact most closely connected.

Articles 8--11 of the Convention deal with the nationality of
married women, containing provisions mitigating the artificial
and technical principle that their nationality follows that of
their husbands, and enabling them under certain conditions to
retain premarital nationality. An advance on these provisions
was made in the Convention on the Nationality of Married
Women opened for signature on February 20, 1957, under which
each Contracting State agrees that neither the celebration nor
the dissolution of marriage between one of its nationals and an
alien, nor a change of nationality by the husband during
marriage, shall have any automatic effect on the wife's nationality,
and provision is made for facilitating, through naturalisation,
the voluntary acquisition by an alien wife of her husband's
nationality.

Statelessness is a condition recognised both by municipal
law[^342/1] and by international law. It has indeed become in recent
years a major problem of international law, the very urgency
and acuteness of which prompted the insertion of Article 15
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of December,
1948, that "everyone has the right to a nationality", and that
no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality".
Statelessness may arise through conflicts of municipal
nationality laws, through changes of sovereignty over territory,
and through denationalisation by the State of nationality.[^342/2] It
is a condition which not only means great hardship and lack
of security for individuals; but involves the existence of a
serious gap in the application of international law.[^342/3]

Remedial action for the condition lies in :---

(a) Imposing
duties upon States to regard a certain nationality as acquired,
or not to regard a certain nationality as lost, or to grant a
nationality upon special grounds or subject to special conditions.
Limited progress in this field was achieved by certain
treaty provisions adopted in 1930 at the Hague Codification
Conference,[^343/1] and recently by the Convention on the Reduction
of Statelessness, adopted at New York on August 30, 1961.[^343/2]

(b) Obliging States to refrain from denationalisation measures
unless there be just cause.

(c) The conferment by liberal-minded
States of their nationality upon stateless persons. Many
States have begrudged this solution.

(d) Relief from the disadvantages
of this unprotected status through international
Conventions allowing the use of identity or travel documents,
and privileges of admission by foreign States with rights of
residence, of practising an occupation, etc.

In this regard, the
Convention on the Status of Refugees signed at Geneva on
July 25, 1951,[^343/3] and the Convention relating to the Status of
Stateless Persons signed at New York on September 28, 1954,
conferred important benefits on stateless persons.

The subject of statelessness, and of remedial action in regard
to it, was under study for some time by the International Law
Commission, and by the General Assembly of the United
Nations.

### Nationality of Corporations and Unincorporated Associations

The nationality of corporations and unincorporated associations
is entirely a modern conception, and becomes relevant
when it is necessary to determine the nationality of such
corporations or associations for the purpose of applying the
"nationality of claims" principle[^344/1] in a case before an international
tribunal, or for giving effect to a treaty applying to
"nationals" of a State.

There is no unanimity of opinion regarding the tests to be
applied for ascertaining the nationality of these bodies. _Prima
facie_, the nationality of a corporation or limited company is
that of the State of incorporation. This test is also adopted
by some treaties. The national status of the individual
corporators or shareholders is not generally a material consideration
in this connection.[^344/2] _Prima facie_, also, the nationality
of an unincorporated association is that of the State in which
the association has been constituted, or of the State in which
the governing body of the association is normally located for
administrative purposes.

## RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF STATES WITH REGARD TO ALIENS

### Admission of Aliens

Four principal opinions have been held regarding the admission
of aliens into countries not of their nationality :---

(a) A State is under a duty to admit all aliens.

(b) A State is under a duty to admit all aliens, subject to
the qualification that it is entitled to exclude certain classes,
for example drug addicts, persons with diseases, and other
undesirables.

(c) A State is bound to admit aliens but may impose
conditions with regard to their admission.

(d) A State is fully entitled to exclude all aliens at will.
So far as State practice is concerned, it may be said that the
first view has never been accepted as a general rule of international
law.

Most States claim in legal theory to exclude all aliens at
will, affirming that such unqualified right is an essential
attribute of sovereign government. The Courts of Great
Britain and the United States have laid it down that the right
to exclude aliens at will is an incident of territorial sovereignty.
In Great Britain, this right was unhesitatingly declared in the
leading case of Musgrove v. Chun Teeong Toy.[^345/1] Similarly, in
the United States this view has been stated by the Supreme
Court in the two leading cases of Nishimura Ekiu v. U.S.[^345/2] and
Fong Yue Ting v. U.S.,[^345/3] in equally unqualified terms.

The absence of any duty at international law to admit aliens
is supported by an examination of State immigration laws,
showing that scarcely any States freely admit aliens. If further
evidence be necessary, it is supplied by the several agreements
and Conventions concluded since 1920, providing for the
admission of refugees, of which an important example is the
Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees of July 25, 1951.

While theoretically almost all States claim the right to
exclude aliens, in practice they do not exercise this right to
its fullest extent.[^345/4] As a general rule, conditions are imposed
on admission, or only certain classes, for example, tourists,
students, are freely admitted. Moreover, there is one practical
limitation on the full exercise of the right which every State
must carefully take into account, namely, that the entire
prohibition of the citizens of one particular State would
diplomatically be regarded as an affront or as an unfriendly
act towards that State.

Most frequently the case of reciprocal admission or exclusion
of aliens by different States is dealt with by bilateral treaties of
commerce and navigation, or of establishment.[^345/5] Usually
States do not press their rights under such treaties because to do
so might restrict their own freedom of action.

### Legal Position of Aliens when Admitted

An alien entering the territory of a State becomes subject
to its laws in the same way exactly as citizens of that State.
Most States, however, place aliens under some kind of disability
or some measure of restrictions of varying severity.
Frequently they are denied voting rights or the right to practise
certain professions or the power of holding real estate.

In 1924, the Economic Committee of the League of Nations
classified the treatment of aliens abroad under the following
headings :---

(a) Fiscal treatment, for example, in respect of taxation.

(b) Rights as to the exercise of professions, industries, or
occupations.

(c) Treatment in such matters as residence, the holding of
property, and civil privileges and immunities.

(d) Conditions of admission and immigration.

As to (a), unless possessing diplomatic immunity, resident
aliens are not exempt from ordinary civil taxes or customs dues.
Leading English and American decisions have also affirmed
the right of all States at international law to tax property
physically within their jurisdiction belonging to non-resident
aliens.[^346/1]

As to (c), aliens are exempt from any compulsory obligation
to serve in the armed forces of the country in which they reside,
unless the State to which they belong consents to waive this
exemption.[^346/2] This rule, however, does not prevent compulsory
service in a local police force, or, apparently, compulsory
service for the purpose of maintaining public order or repelling
a sudden invasion.[^346/3] During the Second World War most
belligerent States compelled resident aliens to perform some
kind of service connected with the war effort, even to the extent
of making voluntary service in the armed forces an alternative
to the performance of compulsory civilian duties. In certain
instances, this was sanctioned by agreement or treaty between
the States concerned.

As noted above in Chapter 9 on State Responsibility, an
alien carries with him a right of protection by his national
State, although the latter is not duty bound to exercise that
right. Grossly unfair discrimination or outright arbitrary
confiscation of the alien's property would, for example, be
legitimate ground for intervention by that State. An alien's
vested rights in his country of residence are also entitled to protection.
But as the decision of the Permanent Court of International
Justice in the Oscar Chinn Case[^347/1] shows, protection of
vested rights does not mean that the State of residence is duty
bound to abstain from providing advantages for local enterprises,
which may cause loss to an alien in his business. A
number of States, including the Afro-Asian group, hold that
the national standard of treatment should apply, inasmuch as
an alien entering impliedly submits to that standard, otherwise
he could elect not to enter.

A resident alien owes temporary allegiance or obedience to
his State of residence, sufficient at any rate to support a charge
of treason.[^347/2]

### Expulsion and Reconduction[^347/3] of Aliens

States are generally recognised as possessing the power to
expel, deport, and reconduct aliens. Like the power to refuse
admission, this is regarded as an incident of a State's territorial
sovereignty. Not even a State's own citizens are immune
from this power, as witness the denationalisation and expulsion
by certain States in recent times of their own nationals.

The power to expel and the manner of expulsion are, however,
two distinct matters. Expulsion (or reconduction) must be
effected in a reasonable manner and without unnecessary injury
to the alien affected. Detention prior to expulsion should be
avoided, unless the alien concerned refuses to leave the State
or is likely to evade the authorities. Also an alien should not
be deported to a country or territory where his person or
freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion,
nationality, or political views.[^348/1] Nor should he be exposed to
unnecessary indignity.

International law does not prohibit the expulsion en masse
of aliens, although this is resorted to usually by way of reprisals
only. It may, however, be treated as an unfriendly act.

## EXTRADITION, RENDITION AND ASYLUM

The liberty of a State to accord asylum to a person overlaps
to a certain extent with its liberty to refuseextraditionor rendition
of him at the request of some other State, an overlapping best
seen in the grant, commonly, of asylum to political offenders,
who correspondingly are not as a rule extraditable. Asylum
stops, as it were, where extradition or rendition begins, and
this interdependence[^348/2] makes it convenient to consider the two
subjects together.

### Extradition

The term "extradition" denotes the process whereby under
treaty or upon a basis of reciprocity one State surrenders to
another State at its request a person accused or convicted of a
criminal offence committed against the laws of the requesting
State, such requesting State being competent to try the alleged
offender. Normally, the alleged offence has been committed
within the territory or aboard a ship[^348/3] flying the flag of the
requesting State, and normally it is within the territory of the
surrendering State that the alleged offender has taken refuge.
Requests for extradition are usually made and answered
through the diplomatic channel.

The following rational considerations have conditioned the
law and practice as to extradition :---

(a) The general desire of all States to ensure that serious
crimes do not go unpunished. Frequently a State in whose
territory a criminal has taken refuge cannot prosecute or
punish him purely because of some technical rule of criminal
law or for lack of jurisdiction. Therefore to close the net round
such fugitive offenders, international law applies the maxim,
aut punire aut dedere", i.e., the offender must be punished
by the State of refuge or surrendered to the State which can
and will punish him.

(b) The State on whose territory[^349/1] the crime has been committed
is best able to try the offender because the evidence is
more freely available there, and that State has the greatest
interest in the punishment of the offender, and the greatest
facilities for ascertaining the truth. It follows that it is only
right and proper that to the territorial State should be surrendered
such criminals as have taken refuge abroad.

With the increasing rapidity and facility of international
transport and communications, extradition began to assume
prominence in the nineteenth century, although actually extradition
arrangements date from the eighteenth century. Because
of the negative attitude[^349/2] of customary international law on the
subject, extradition was at first dealt with by bilateral treaties.
These treaties, inasmuch as they affected the rights of private
citizens, required in their turn alterations to the laws and
statutes of the States which had concluded them. Hence the
general principle became established that without some formal
authority either by treaty or by statute, fugitive criminals
would not be surrendered nor would their surrender be
requested. There was at international law neither a duty to
surrender, nor a duty not to surrender. For this reason,
extradition was called by some writers a matter "of imperfect
obligation". In the absence of treaty or statute, the grant of
extradition depended purely on reciprocity or courtesy.[^350/1]

As regards English municipal law, the special traditions of
the common law conditioned the necessity for treaty and
statute. At common law the Crown had no power to arrest
a fugitive criminal and to surrender him to another State;
furthermore, treaties as to extradition were deemed to derogate
from the private law rights of English citizens, and required
legislation before they could come into force in England.[^350/2]
Thus from both points of view legislation was essential, and
the solution adopted was to pass a general extradition statute
---the Extradition Act, 1870.---which applies only in respect of
countries with which an arrangement for the surrender of
fugitive offenders has been concluded, and to which the Act
itself has been applied by Order-in-Council.

International law concedes that the grant of and procedure
as to extradition are most properly left to municipal law.
There are some divergences on the subject of extradition
between the different State laws, particularly as to the following
matters :--- extraditability of nationals of the State of asylum;
evidence of guilt required by the State of asylum; and the
relative powers of the executive and judicial organs in the
procedure of surrendering the fugitive criminal.

Before an application for extradition is made through the
diplomatic channel, two conditions are as a rule required to
be satisfied :---

(a) There must be an extraditable person.

(b) There must be an extradition crime.

We shall discuss each of these conditions.

#### (a) Extraditable Persons

There is uniformity of State practice to the effect that the
requesting State may obtain the surrender of its own nationals
or nationals of a third State. But most States usually refuse
the extradition of their own nationals who have taken refuge
in their territory, although as between States who observe
absolute reciprocity of treatment in this regard, requests for
surrender are sometimes acceded to.

#### (b) Extradition Crimes

The ordinary practice as to extradition crimes is to list these
in each bilateral extradition treaty.

Generally, States extradite only for serious crimes,[^351/1] and there
is an obvious advantage in thus limiting the list of extradition
crimes since the procedure is so cumbrous and expensive.
Certain States, for example, France, extradite only for offences
which are subject to a definite minimum penalty, both in the
State requesting and in the State requested to grant extradition.
In the case of Great Britain, extradition crimes are scheduled
to the Extradition Act, 1870.

As a general rule, the following offences are not subject to
extradition proceedings :---

(i) political crimes;

(ii) military
offences, for example, desertion;

(iii) religious offences.

The
principle of non-extradition of political offenders crystallised
in the nineteenth century, a period of internal convulsions,
when tolerant, liberal States such as Holland, Switzerland, and
Great Britain, insisted on their right to shelter political refugees.
At the same time, it is not easy to define a "political crime".
Different criteria have been adopted :---

(a) the motive of the
crime;

(b) the circumstances of its commission;

(c) that it
embraces specific offences only, e.g. treason or attempted
treason[^352/1];

(d) that the act is directed against the political
organisation, as such, of the requesting State;

(e) the test
followed in the English cases, Re Meunier,[^352/2] and Re Castioni,[^352/3]
that there must be two parties striving for political control in
the State where the offence is committed, the offence being
committed in pursuance of that goal, thereby excluding
anarchist and terrorist acts from the category of "political
crimes".

More recently, in R. v. Governor of Brixton Prison,
Ex parte Kolczynski,[^352/4] the Court favoured an even more extended
meaning, holding in effect that offences committed in
association with a political object (e.g. anti-Communism), or
with a view to avoiding political persecution or prosecution for
political defaults, are "political crimes", notwithstanding the
absence of any intention to overthrow an established Government.

A number of decisions by municipal Courts show that
extradition will not be denied for actual offences, including
crimes of violence, having no direct and close relation to political
aims, although committed in the course of political controversy,
or by persons politically opposed to the requesting
Government.[^352/5] In this connection, the question of war crimes
gives rise to difficulties; to some extent the issues involved are
matters of degree, insofar as a war crime may or may not
transcend its political implications.

International law leaves to the State of asylum the sovereign
right of deciding, according to its municipal law and practice,
the question whether or not the offence which is the subject
of a request for extradition is a political crime.[^352/6]

As regards the character of the crime, most States follow
the rule of double criminality, i.e., that it is a condition of
extradition that the crime is punishable according to the law
both of the State of asylum and of the requesting State. The
application of the rule to peculiar circumstances came before
the United States Supreme Court in 1933 in the case of Factor
v. Laubenheimer.[^353/1] There, proceedings were taken by the
British authorities for the extradition of Jacob Factor on a
charge of receiving in London money which he knew to have
been fraudulently obtained. At the time extradition was
applied for, Factor was residing in the State of Illinois, by
the laws of which the offence charged was not an offence in
Illinois. It was held by the Supreme Court that this did not
prevent extradition if, according to the criminal law generally of
the United States, the offence was punishable; otherwise
extradition might fail merely because the fugitive offender
would succeed in finding in the country of refuge some province
in which the offence charged was not punishable.

A further principle sometimes applied is known as the
principle of speciality, i.e., the requesting State is under a duty
not to try or punish the offender for any other offence than that
for which he was extradited. This principle is frequently embodied
in treaties of extradition and is approved by the Supreme
Court of the United States. In Great Britain its application is
a little uncertain; in R. v. Corrigan[^353/2] the Extradition Act was
held to prevail over a Treaty of Extradition with France
embodying the speciality principle, and it was ruled that the
accused there could be tried for an offence for which he was
not extradited.

### Rendition

This more generic term "rendition" covers instances where
an offender may be returned to a State to be tried there, under
_ad hoc_ special arrangement, in the absence of an extradition
treaty, or even if there be such a treaty between the States
concerned, and irrespective of whether or not the alleged
offence is an extraditable crime.

A deportation or refusal of asylum may have the effect of a
rendition, although from the point of view of the deporting
State or State of purported entry, it is not of this nature stricto
sensu.[^354/1]

### Asylum

The conception of asylum[^354/2] in international law involves two
elements :---

(a) shelter, which is more than merely temporary
refuge; and

(b) a degree of active protection on the part of
the authorities in control of the territory of asylum.

Asylum may be territorial (or internal), i.e., granted by a
State on its territory; or it may be extra-territorial, i.e., granted
for and in respect of legations, consular premises, international
headquarters, warships, and merchant vessels to refugees from
the authorities of the territorial State. The differences between
the principles applying to the two kinds of asylum flow from the
fact that the power to grant territorial asylum is an incident
of territorial sovereignty itself, whereas the granting of extra-territorial
asylum is rather a derogation from the sovereignty
of the territorial State insofar as that State is required to
acquiesce in fugitives from its authorities enjoying protection
from apprehension.[^354/3]

Consistently with this distinction, the general principle is
that every State has a plenary right to grant territorial asylum
unless it has accepted some particular restriction in this regard,
while the right to grant extra-territorial asylum is exceptional
and must be established in each case.

Both types of asylum have this in common, that they involve
an adjustment between the legal claims of State sovereignty,
and the demands of humanity.

#### 1. Territorial Asylum

A State's liberty to grant asylum in its territory is of ancient
origins, and extends not only to political, social, or religious
refugees, but to all persons from abroad, including criminal
offenders; it is merely one aspect of a State's general power
of admission or exclusion from its territory. Normally, however,
persons not being nationals of the territorial State, and
who are held in custody on foreign vessels within that State's
waters, will not be granted asylum. It is a matter of controversy
whether a State may grant asylum to prisoners of war
detained by it, but unwilling to be repatriated.[^355/1]

It is sometimes said that the fugitive has a "right of asylum".[^355/2]
This is inaccurate, as fugitives have no enforceable right in
international law to enjoy asylum. The only international
legal right involved is that of the State of refuge itself to grant
asylum. Municipal legal systems (_see_, for example, the Constitutions
of France and Italy) do indeed sometimes provide for
a right of asylum to individuals fleeing from persecution, and
an example of a modern international instrument (not being
a binding Convention) providing for an individual right of
asylum from persecution is the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, 1948 (_see_ Article 14). But, so far, no such
individual right is guaranteed by international law, although
a Declaration on Territorial Asylum adopted by the United
Nations General Assembly on December 14, 1967, recommends
that, in their practices, States should follow a number of standards
and _desiderata_, among which are the following :---

(a) A
person seeking asylum from persecution (_see_ Article 14, _ante_,
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) should not be
subject to rejection at the frontier, or if he has already entered
the territory in which he seeks asylum, to expulsion or compulsory
return. If there are overriding reasons of national security,
or if it be necessary to safeguard the population, as in the case of
a mass influx, asylum may be refused, but the State concerned
should consider granting the person seeking refuge an opportunity,
by way of provisional asylum or otherwise, of going to
another State (Article 3).

(b) Where a State finds difficulty in
granting or continuing to grant asylum, States individually or
jointly or through the United Nations should consider, "in a
spirit of international solidarity", appropriate measures to
lighten the burden on that State (Article 2).

(c) Asylum granted
to persons seeking refuge from persecution should be respected
by all other States (Article 1).

The liberty of States to grant asylum may, of course, be cut
down by treaties of the States concerned of which, as we have
seen, extradition treaties are the commonest illustration. In
principle, asylum ought not to be granted to any person, with
respect to whom there are well-founded reasons for considering
that he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a
crime against humanity (_see_ Article 1 paragraph 2 of the
Declaration on Territorial Asylum, referred to, _ante_).

#### Extra-territorial Asylum

##### (a) Asylum in Legations

Modern international law recognises
no general right of a head of mission to grant asylum in
the premises of the legation.[^356/1] Such grant seems rather prohibited
by international law where its effect would be to exempt
the fugitive from the regular application of laws and administration
of justice by the territorial State. The lack of any
such general right of diplomatic asylum was affirmed by the
International Court of Justice in the Asylum Case,[^356/2] which
dealt with the application of alleged regional Latin-American
rules of international law concerning such asylum.

Exceptionally, asylum may be granted in legation premises :---

(a) As a temporary measure, to individuals physically in
danger from mob disorder or mob rule, or where the fugitive
is in peril because of extreme political corruption in the local
State, the justification being presumably that by the grant of
asylum, an urgent threat is temporarily tided over.

(b) Where
there is a binding local custom, long recognised, that such
diplomatic asylum is permissible.

(c) Under a special treaty
(usually allowing such right in respect of political offenders
only) between the territorial State and the State which is
represented by the legation concerned.

##### (b) Asylum in Consulates or Consular Premises

Similar
principles, subject to the same exceptions, apply as in the case
of legation premises.

##### (c) Asylum in the Premises of International Institutions

The Headquarters Agreements of the United Nations and of
the specialised agencies reveal no general right of international
institutions to grant asylum or even refuge in their premises to
offenders as against the territorial State, and _semble_ not even
a right of protection on humanitarian grounds. It is difficult
to conceive, however, that a right to grant temporary refuge
in an extreme case of danger from mob rule would not be
asserted and conceded.

##### (d) Asylum in Warships

This has been discussed in a
previous Chapter.[^357/1]

##### (e) Asylum in Merchant Vessels

Merchant vessels are not
exempt from the local jurisdiction, and therefore cannot grant
asylum to local offenders.

## HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS[^357/2]

At the date of writing, the formulation of binding general
rules of international law for the protection of human rights
and fundamental freedoms by adequate machinery for their
enforcement remains more a promise than an achievement.
It is true that in Europe there have been established an international
administrative body and an international Court for
the purpose of protecting human rights, namely the European
Commission of Human Rights and the European Court
of Human Rights, but these two organs operate under jurisdictional
and procedural restrictions, and in respect to that limited
number of States only which have accepted their competence.
There are also a large number of international Conventions, mentioned
below, including the Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights, and the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
both adopted December 16, 1966. Apart therefrom, however,
there has been little concrete progress in the direction of establishing
effective machinery to protect individual rights beyond
the point of proclaiming conceptions, attempting definitions,
making programmatic statements or declarations, establishing
organs with limited powers of promotion, investigation, or
recommendation,[^358/1] and encouraging the mass communication of
the aims and ideals to be realised. A number of human rights
and fundamental freedoms are not the subject of protection by
any binding general international Convention or Conventions.

The following are the principal instruments in which attempts
have been made to enunciate or guarantee human rights
standards :---

(1) The United Nations Charter[^358/2] and the Constitutions of
the specialised agencies. These neither impose binding obligations
on Member States to observe human rights, nor concretely
define such rights. Pledges are expressed in the most
general language, and the powers of the United Nations and
its organs laid down in terms only of recommendation, promotion,
and encouragement.

(2) The Paris Peace Treaties of 1947 with Italy, Rumania,
Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. These contained general
pledges only to respect human rights, unsupported by any
Court or machinery to enforce them. They proved of little
value in 1948--1950 when the matter of alleged breaches of
human rights by Rumania, Bulgaria, and Hungary was
raised in the United Nations General Assembly.[^359/1]

(3) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted
by the United Nations General Assembly in December, 1948.
This Declaration represented the first of three stages of a
programme designed to achieve an International Bill of Rights,
based upon universally binding obligations of States, and reinforced
by effective curial and administrative machinery.
Chronologically, the three stages were to be :--- 1. A Declaration
defining the various human rights which ought to be respected.
2. A series of binding covenants on the part of States to
respect such rights as defined. 3. Measures and machinery
for implementation.

Consequently, the Declaration could not and did not purport
to be more than a manifesto, a statement of ideals, a "pathfinding"
instrument. To that extent, it has achieved as much
as could be expected. Its most important contribution lies in
the pioneering formulation of the principal human rights and
fundamental freedoms that ought to be recognised. To
reproach the Declaration for the absence of provision of
enforcement machinery or for the fact that it is not a binding
legal instrument, is to misconstrue its original limited purpose
---to provide a generally acceptable catalogue of man's inalienable
rights.

(4) The European Convention for the Protection of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed by the Member
States of the Council of Europe at Rome, November 4, 1950.[^360/1]
Sponsored by the Council of Europe, this important regional
Charter of human rights went beyond the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights in :---

(a) imposing binding commitments
to provide effective domestic remedies in regard to a number
of the rights specified in the Universal Declaration;

(b) the
close and elaborate definition of such rights as it embraced,
and of the exceptions and restrictions to each of such rights;

(c) the establishment of a European Commission of Human
Rights to investigate and report on violations of human rights
at the instance of States parties, or-if the State against which
complaint is laid, has so accepted-upon the petition of any
person, non-governmental organisation, or group of individuals
within that State's jurisdiction.

The Commission
became competent to receive applications of the latter type in
July, 1955, after (as required by the Convention) six States had
accepted the right of individual recourse; the number of
accepting States has since increased. The Convention also
provided for a European Court of Human Rights with compulsory
jurisdiction, to come into being upon at least eight
States accepting such jurisdiction.[^360/2] This was achieved in
September, 1958, and the Court was set up in January, 1959;
it delivered its first judgment on November 14, 1960, in the
Lawless Case. On December 21, 1965, the British Government
accepted the relevant optional provisions, so recognising
the right of recourse to the Commission, and the jurisdiction
of the Court.

Although the Commission has been very active and has dealt
with hundreds of applications, the great majority of these
have been declared inadmissible under the Convention because
of failure to exhaust local remedies, lapse of a period of 6
months or more after final decision by a domestic Court
(Article 26), activities of applicants aimed at the destruction
of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention
(Article 17),[^361/1] and other grounds, such as the anonymity of the
applicant. If the application is admissible, the Commission's
primary action, if it has been unable to dispose of the matter
by conciliation, is to transmit its report on the question of a
breach of a right under the Convention to the Committee of
Ministers of the Council of Europe, which may decide on the
measures[^361/2] to be taken if there has been a breach, unless the
matter is referred to the Court within a period of 3 months.
As to the Court, only the States accepting its jurisdiction and the
Commission, and not individuals, have the right to bring a
a case before it. The technicalities and limitations which
surround the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court iņ a matter
referred to it by the Commission are well illustrated in its two
rulings in the Lawless Case (p. 360),[^361/3] one dealing with questions
of procedure concerning _inter alia_ the complainant's right to
receive a copy of the Commission's report, the other with the
merits of the application, that is to say the allegation of breach
of human rights.[^361/4] Yet the influence of the Court is not to be
minimised; both directly and indirectly, it has led to changes in
legislation,[^362/1] and this has occurred, in particular, where it was
sought to avoid an anticipated adverse decision. In other cases
which have come before it, raising questions as to the scope and
effect of rights in the Convention and Supplementary Protocol
of 1952, the Court has given important rulings, to which due
respect will be paid by the domestic courts of States parties.[^362/2]

(5) The Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,
and the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by the
United Nations General Assembly on December 16, 1966 and
opened for signature on December 19, 1966. These two
Covenants have represented an attempt to complete the second
stage, referred to above, of binding covenants to observe
human rights. A single Covenant was first contemplated,
but the United Nations General Assembly reversed its directive
to the Human Rights Commission, requesting it to prepare
two separate covenants dealing respectively with economic,
social, and cultural rights, and with civil and political rights.
These instruments were the subject of continuous consideration
and revision by the General Assembly.

Although the two Covenants recognise different sets of
rights, they contain some common provisions, for instance as
to the recognition of the right of self-determination, and as to
the prohibition of discrimination. On the other hand, they
differ in respect to the machinery set up under each. The
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides for a Committee
with the responsibility of considering reports from States
parties, and of addressing comments, if necessary, to these
States and to the Economic and Social Council of the United
Nations. Inasmuch as it was felt that economic, social and
cultural rights could be achieved less quickly than civil and
political rights, because the latter could be safeguarded by
immediate legislation, whereas the former depended upon
resources becoming progressively available to each State,
the Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights
provides merely for the submission of periodical reports to the
Economic and Social Council upon the progress made and
measures taken to advance the rights concerned.

(6) Obligations to respect certain human rights are contained
in the Convention for the Suppression of Traffic in Persons and
of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others opened for signature
on March 31, 1950, the Convention on the Status of Refugees
of July 25, 1951, and the Supplementary Geneva Convention
of September 7, 1956, for Abolishing Slavery, the Slave Trade,
and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery (e.g. serfdom,
debt bondage), in five Conventions adopted by Conferences
of the International Labour Organisation, namely, the Freedom
of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,
1948, the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining
Convention, 1949, the Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951,
the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957, and the
Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention,
1958 and in the important International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, of December
21, 1965. Under the last-mentioned Convention, provision
was made for the establishment of a Committee on the Elimination
of Racial Discrimination, to deal with allegations of violations
of human rights, and to consider reports from States
parties on measures adopted to give effect to the Convention.
The Committee commenced work in 1970, after the entry into
force of the Convention in 1969.

Reference should also be made to :---

(a) The influence upon municipal law of these Charters and
instruments relating to human rights; for example, as revealed
in the decisions of certain municipal Courts, that contracts
which conflict with human rights should be held illegal and
invalid on the ground of public policy,[^363/1] and as shown in the
guarantees for human rights contained in the Constitutions of
certain new States which attained independence after 1945.[^364/1]

(b) The undertakings by Italy and Yugoslavia under the
Memorandum of Understanding of October 5, 1954, as to
Trieste, to apply the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
in their respective administrative zones in Trieste.

(c) The formulations or definitions of human rights in such
programmatic statements as the American Declaration of the
Rights and Duties of Man of 1948, the Declaration of the Rights
of the Child adopted by the General Assembly on November
20, 1959, and the Fifteen General Principles on Freedom and
Non-Discrimination in the Matter of Political Rights adopted
by the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in January, 1962.[^364/2]

(d) The American Convention on Human Rights, opened
for signature on November 22, 1969. In addition to detailed
definitions of human rights, provision is made for establishing
an Inter-American Court of Human Rights; States parties
wishing to accept the Court's jurisdiction may make declarations
to this effect when ratifying or adhering to the Convention
(_see_ Article 62).

[^345/4]: Certain States, e.g., Great Britain and the Netherlands, indeed insist on a
right to grant territorial asylum to refugees from countries where they are
subject to persecution on political, racial, or religious grounds.

[^345/5]: The Treaty of Rome of March 25, 1957, establishing the European Economic

[^346/2]: In the U.S., aliens can be called up for service, but have the right to opt out,
in which event:

    (a) if they subsequently leave the U.S., they cannot return; and

    (b) if they stay, they will not be granted U.S. citizenship. In 1966, the Australian Government purported to make alien migrants subject to compulsory
    service, formal protests being received from the U.S.S.R., Italy, Spain, and
    other countries.

July 25, 1951, and _cf._ United States ex rel. Weinberg v. Schlotfeldt (1938),
26 F. Supp. 283.

[^348/2]: No question of asylum, and therefore of interdependence between it and
extradition, arises however where a State is requested to extradite its own
resident nationals. Article 1 of the Declaration on Territorial Asylum adopted
by the United Nations General Assembly on December 14, 1967, recommends
that all States should "respect" (this would include refraining from an
application for extradition) asylum granted to persons who have sought
refuge from persecution, including persons struggling against colonialism.

[^348/3]: R. v. Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex parte Minervini, (1959) 1 Q.B. 155;
(1958) 3 All E. R. 318.

[^349/1]: "Territory" can cover, for this purpose, also ships and aircraft registered
with the requesting State; _see_ Article 16 of the Tokyo Convention of September
14, 1963 on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft
(offences committed on board aircraft in flight to be treated for purposes of
extradition as if committed also in country of registration).

[^349/2]: On the one hand, customary international law imposed no duty upon
States to surrender alleged or convicted offenders to another State, while on
the other hand, it did not forbid the State of refuge to deliver over the alleged
delinquent to the State requesting his surrender.

[^350/1]: Reference should be made to the European Convention on Extradition,
December 13, 1957 (Council of Europe) as an illustration of a multilateral
extradition treaty,

[^350/2]: _See above_, pp. 20--21.

[^351/1]: Recent practice shows a general disposition of States to treat alleged
war crimes as extradition crimes. However, there are a number of
decisions of municipal Courts treating war crimes as political offences for
the purpose of extradition (_cf._ Karadzole v. Artukovic (1957), 247 F.(20) 198),
so that extradition is refused.

[^352/1]: A number of bilateral and other treaties after the Second World War,
including the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947 with Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria,
Hungary, and Finland, provided for the surrender of's quislings", persons
guilty of treason, and so-called "collaborationists" with the enemy occupying
authorities.

[^352/2]: (1894), 2 Q.B. 415.

[^352/3]: (1891), 1 Q.B. 149.

[^352/4]: (1955), 1 Q.B. 540.

[^352/5]: _Cf._ R. v. Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex parte Schtraks, (1963) 1 Q.B. 55.

[^352/6]: Quaere, whether an English Court should accept an unconditional undertaking
by the requesting State not to apply a particular law to the extraditee;
_see_ Armah v. Government of Ghana, (1966] 3 AII E.R. 177.

[^353/1]: 290 U.S. 276.

[^353/2]: (1931), 1 K.B. 527.

[^354/1]: _Cf._ R. v. Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex parte Soblen, (1963) 2 Q.B. 243
(deportation allowable under aliens legislation, even though alleged offence
is non-extraditable, and even if there be a request for rendition).

[^354/2]: _See_ for treatment of various aspects of asylum Report of the 51st
Conference of the International Law Association, Tokyo (1964), pp. 215--293.

[^354/3]: _See_ Asylum Case, I.C.J. Reports (1950), at 274--275.

[^355/1]: _See also below_, pp. 521--522.

[^355/2]: It has be claimed that there is such an individual right of asylum because
the fugitive is not usually surrendered, in the absence of an extradition treaty,
and because if his offence is political, he is not generally subject to extradition,
but the flaw in this proposition is that it takes account only of persons to whom
asylum has been granted, not of those to whom asylum has been refused.

[^356/1]: _See_ Satow, Guide to Diplomatic Practice (1957), (edited Bland), at p. 219,
It is significant that the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of April
18, 1961, provides for no such right.

[^356/2]: _See_ I.C.J. Reports (1950), pp. 266 _et seq._ In the Haya de la Torre Case
(1951), I.C.J. Reports, pp. 71 _et seq._, arising out of the same facts, the Court
held that where asylum in legation premises has been granted without justification,
the head of the mission concerned is not obliged to deliver the fugitive
to the local authorities, in the absence of a treaty binding him to do so.

[^357/1]: _See above_, p. 266.

Rights (1970); P. N. Ďrost, Human Rights as Legal Rights (1965); and

United Nations Economic and Social Council, and its Sub-Commission.
Another example is the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
established in August, 1959, by the Organisation of American States (OAS).

Affairs (1950), pp. 168--80; and Advisory Opinion of the International Court
of Justice on the Interpretation of the Peace Treaties, I.C.J. Reports (1950),
65, 221.

[^360/1]: The Convention has since been amended by a number of Protocols,
adding to the list of rights protected by the Convention, enabling the European
Court of Human Rights to give advisory opinions on the interpretation of the
Convention, and for improving the internal procedure of the European Commission
of Human Rights.

[^360/2]: An abortive move was made in 1946--1947 at the Paris Peace Conference
to create a European Court of Human Rights.

[^361/1]: In 1957, the Commission held that, for this reason, the German Communist
Party was not entitled to make an application against the German
Federal Republic complaining of a violation of the right to freedom of associa.
tion, in that an order for its dissolution had been made in 1956 by the Federal
Constitutional Court. On the other hand, in the Lawless Case in 1961, the
Court held that even if the applicant were a member of the Irish Republican
Army and this organisation were engaged in such destructive activities as
mentioned, this did not absolve the respondent State, Ireland, from observing
those provisions of the Convention conferring freedom from arbitrary arrest
and from detention without trial.

[^361/2]: These measures may include requiring action to correct the breach; if
satisfactory action has not been taken in the prescribed period, the Committee
of Ministers is to decide what effect should be given to its decision.

[^361/3]: Considerations of space preclude discussion of this case. _See_ American
Journal of International Law (1962), pp. 187--210 for the Court's ruling on the
merits.

[^361/4]: On the questions of procedure, the Court ruled that the complainant was
entitled to receive a copy of the report, but not to publish it, and that the
complainant's point of view could be put before the Court, not directly by
himself, but through delegates of the Commission, or in the Commission's
report, or in his evidence, if called as a witness. On the merits, the Court held
that the complainant's arrest and detention without trial were justified by
a public emergency threatening the life of the respondent country, Ireland,
within the meaning of Article 15 of the Convention, and that this emergency
had been duly notified under this Article to the Secretary-General of the
Council of Europe.

[^362/1]: The De Becker Case, as to which _see_ Yearbook of European Convention
on Human Rights, 1962 (1963), pp. 320--337, resulted in a change of legislation.

[^362/2]: As, e.g., in 1968 in the Wemhoff and Neumeister Cases (right to trial within
a reasonable time, and questions of length of detention pending trial), and in
the Belgian "Linguistic" Case (the right to education does not oblige Governments
to educate in a particular language, and what constitutes discriminatory
treatment). _Cf._ the later Stögmüller and Matznetter Cases (whether the
preventive detention of the complainants extended beyond a reasonable time).

[^363/1]: _See_ e.g. In re Drummond Wren, [1945] 4 O.R. 778.

[^364/1]: _See_, e.g. sections 17--32 of the Constitution of Nigeria, which became
independent in 1960.

[^364/2]: Reference should also be made to the various Resolutions, from time
to time, of the Human Rights Commission for promoting and developing
human rights throughout the world. These are transmitted for approval or
other action to the Economic and Social Council. The Commission has
evolved a procedure whereby a Sub-Commission working group meets in
separate session to consider human rights complaints reaching the United
Nations, for the purpose of referring to the Sub-Commission those complaints
revealing a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights; _see_ John
Carey, U.N. Protection of Civil and Political Rights (1970), pp. 91--92.
