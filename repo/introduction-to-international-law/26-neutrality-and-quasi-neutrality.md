## NEUTRALITY AND QUASI-NEUTRALITY

CHAPTER 18
NEUTRALITY AND QUASI-NEUTRALITY
1.--GENERAL
As indicated in the previous Chapter, hostile relations between
States comprise not only (a) war in the traditional sense,
but (b) non-war armed conflicts and breaches of the peace.
Corresponding to these two categories, there are two kinds
of status of the parties outside the range of such hostile
relations:---

(a) the status of neutrality in a war proper; and

(b) the status of non-participation by States or non-State
entities in a non-war armed conflict. The latter status, (b),
is sometimes (as in the case of the Korean conflict, 1950--1953)
loosely referred to as neutrality, but there are certain differences
between it and neutrality proper. It is perhaps better to refer
to it as quasi-neutrality.
Neutrality
In its popular sense, neutrality denotes the attitude of a
State which is not at war with belligerents, and does not
participate in the hostilities. In its technical sense, however,
it is more than an attitude, and denotes a legal status of a
special nature, involving a complex of rights, duties, and
privileges at international law, which must be respected by
belligerents and neutrals alike. This status of neutrality has
been the subject of a long and complicated development, at
each stage of which the content of the status has varied with
the nature of warfare, and with the conditions of political
power in the international community of States.
1 _See_, e.g., the definition of States not participating in the Korean hostilities
neutral nations", in article 37 of the Korean Armistice Agreement of
July 27, 1953, for the purposes of the appointment of a Neutral Nations Super-
visory Commission.
2 The international law status of neutrality should be distinguished from the
policy of " neutralism " (_see_ Chapter 5, above at p. 133). Yet to some extent
neutralism or "non-alignment may be regarded as an ad hoc unilaterally
declared status (sometimes multilaterally as under Article III of the Charter
of the Organisation of African Unity, May, 1963) of dissociation from the
"cold war", involving neither rights nor obligations.

Chap. 18.--Neutrality & Quasi-Neutrality 535
Neutrality gradually developed out of bilateral treaties
stipulating that neither party to the treaty should assist the
enemies of the other if one party were engaged in war. It was
realised that it was to the general convenience of belligerent
States to prevent assistance being furnished to enemies.
Originally such cases of neutrality were isolated and sporadic,
and stopped far short of the notion of a general status.
Certainly the idea that neutral duties devolved on all non-
participants in a given war was a much later development.
The term "neutrality" appeared as early as the seventeenth
century, but no systematic doctrine emerged until the eighteenth
century, when it was discussed by Bynkershoek and Vattel.
By that date theory and practice united in acknowledging the
right of independent States to hold aloof from war, and their
duty in such case to be impartial as between the belligerents.
In the nineteenth century, neutrality developed much more
extensively than in all its previous history. Most historians
attribute this to the part played by the United States as a
neutral in the Napoleonic Wars, when Great Britain was
aligned against Napoleon and his Continental satellites. The
United States Government refused to allow the equipping or
arming of vessels in American territory on behalf of the
belligerents, and it prevented the recruitment of American
citizens for service in the belligerent forces. At the same time
Great Britain was endeavouring to block neutral commerce
with France, and many rules as to neutral and belligerent
rights evolved as compromise solutions of a conflict of interests
between the British and United States Governments. Also,
during the years of the Napoleonic Wars, Lord Stowell
presided over the British Prize Court, and the newly developing
law as to neutral rights and duties owed much to his intellect
and genius as a judicial legislator. Later in the century the
American Civil War gave rise to several disputes on questions
of neutrality between the legitimate United States Government
and Great Britain. Out of these arose the famous _Alabama
Claims Arbitration_ of 1872, concerning the construction and
fitting out in England of commerce-destroying vessels for the
Confederate Navy. The United States Government alleged

------
536
Part 5.---Disputes & Hostile Relations
a breach of neutrality in that the British Government had
failed to exercise due care to prevent the equipping of the
vessels, and their despatch to the Confederates, and a claim
for damage suffered through the activities of the vessels (one
of which was The Alabama) in the Civil War was sustained by
the arbitrators.
Other important factors which favoured the development
of neutrality in the nineteenth century were the permanent
neutralisation of Belgium and Switzerland, which supplied
useful precedents for neutral rights and duties, and the general
growth of great unified sovereign States. It was clearly to the
interests of the latter to be able to maintain unrestricted
commercial intercourse with belligerents without being drawn
into war, as it was plainly to the interests of the belligerents
to prevent assistance being given to their enemies by such
powerful countries. Moreover, conditions were peculiarly
favourable to neutrality inasmuch as the principal wars fought
in the nineteenth century were wars of limited objectives,
unlikely to embroil States other than the participants, so that
there was little risk or threat to neutrals as long as they
observed the rules. In these circumstances the generally
recognised rules of neutrality, some of them embodied in
instruments such as the Declaration of Paris, 1856, and in the
Hague Convention of 1907, commanded the support of,
as they corresponded to the interests of most States.
However, in the First World War (1914--1918)---which de-
veloped almost into " total war"---as in the Second World
War (1939--1945), most of the recognised rules of neutrality
proved quite out of date, could not be applied in many instances,
and instead of assisting to maintain the impartiality of States,
virtually forced them into the struggle (as in the case of the
United States in 1917). In its turn the Second World War
was convincing proof of the archaism of the nineteenth century
conceptions of neutrality. Neutral status proved to be a
condition no less hazardous than that of belligerency. One
neutral State after another was " rolled up ", and the two most
powerful neutrals-Russia and the United States-were each
_See above_, pp. 132--135.

attacked without warning. It is plain that in the future
neutrality can only operate within a limited and quite
unpredictable field, and it is questionable whether it is in the
general interest to preserve an institution of so uncertain a value.
The trend towards restriction of the scope of neutrality has
been confirmed by a significant post-war development, namely,
the conclusion of regional security treaties, such as the North
Atlantic Security Pact of April 4, 1949, and the Pacific Security
Pact of September 1, 1951,1 in which the States Parties have
voluntarily renounced in futuro a right of claiming neutrality
in the event of a war in which their co-Parties to the treaties
have been attacked, and instead will assist the States thus
attacked. To these treaties, the United States, formerly the
most influential neutral State in past wars and the most insistent
on neutral rights, is a party.
Rational Basis of Neutrality
Neutrality is often justified by reference to the following
considerations:---

(1) that it serves to localise war; (2) that
it discourages war; (3) that it enables States to keep out of
war; (4) that it regularises international relations.
The Second World War conclusively demonstrated the
fallacies of (1) and (2), inasmuch as the neutrality of States
such as Norway, Denmark, Holland and Belgium proved an
irresistible temptation to forcible invasion, and prevented
more effective arrangements for their joint defence, with the
consequence that these States were speedily overrun by superior
German forces. The result was to increase Germany's power
in Europe, to bring Italy into the war on Germany's side, and
eventually to encourage Japan to precipitate hostilities in the
Pacific. Thus, far from localising or discouraging war, the
effect of neutrality was to transform a European struggle into
a world conflict.
As to (3), it was virtually in defence of its neutrality that
the United States entered the First World War on the side of
France and Great Britain. Moreover, despite the care taken
in the Second World War by Russia and the United States
to preserve their neutrality, attacks by Germany and Japan,
1 Between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (ANZUS).

------
538
Part 5.-Disputes & Hostile Relations
respectively, forced them into the War only two years after its
outbreak in 1939.
As to (4), the experience of the League of Nations from
1920 to 1940 showed that the institution of neutrality is quite
inconsistent with the maintenance in international relations of
the rule of law. The unjustified reliance of States Members of
the League on traditional notions of neutrality contributed
towards preventing the League machinery from functioning on
the outbreak of the Second World War.
Before this War began, a fundamental change had taken
place in the attitude of most States towards the status of
neutrality. Far from insisting on neutral rights or belligerent
duties, States were now prepared to make all possible con-
cessions to avoid any chance of a clash with the belligerents.
The First World War had shown how a neutral State like the
United States could be drawn into war in defence of its neutral
rights, and no State wished to repeat that experience. States
were determined if possible to keep out of a general war.
In 1936--1937 this attitude was reflected in the non-intervention
policy of France and Great Britain towards the Spanish Civil War.
This new attitude was particularly illustrated by the attitude
of the United States in 1939--1940, before Germany overran
and conquered Western Europe in the summer of 1940, and
by its " Neutrality" law passed by Congress in 1937. The
"Neutrality" Act of 1937 was a misnomer; it was really a
measure to ensure no contacts between the United States and
belligerents which could possibly involve her in war in defence
of neutral rights.
After Germany's victories in Western Europe in June, 1940,
the United States appeared to veer in an entirely opposite
direction. Convinced that Germany's aim was world domina-
tion, the United States initiated a series of measures to aid
Great Britain in the war against Germany and Italy which
would have been unthinkable some twelve months previously.
Whereas before she had been ready to renounce neutral rights,
she paradoxically now appeared to show disregard for neutral
duties, transferring destroyers to Great Britain, sending her
arms, and ammunition, and patrolling dangerous sea-lanes.

------
Chap. 18.-Neutrality & Quasi-Neutrality
539
In addition Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act of March,
1941, which made it possible to provision and equip the armed
forces of Great Britain and her Allies. The legality of the
Lend-Lease Act and of the other measures adopted by the
United States before her entry into the Second World War was
justified on three grounds at least:---

(a) The breach by
Germany and Italy of the Briand-Kellogg Pact of 1928 for the
Outlawry of War, and the fact that these Powers were guilty of
gross aggression against neutral States. (b) The principle of
self-preservation as against Powers like Germany and Italy,
which intended to show no respect for the rights of neutrals.
There was the additional consideration here that if the United
States had allowed Great Britain to be conquered, international
law itself would not have survived. (c) The evidence of
conspiracy on the part of the Axis Powers to launch an attack
on the United States in the immediate future.
Moreover, after the United States became a belligerent, she
showed little traditional regard for neutral rights. Together
with Great Britain, she brought pressure to bear on European
neutrals to withhold supplies from the Axis Powers. This
pressure increased in measure as Allied victories removed any
possibility of a threat to these neutrals from Germany, if they
should cease to trade with Axis countries, until in 1944--1945
the American attitude was that neutral exports of vital products
to Germany would not be countenanced.
Neutrality and the United Nations Charter
Member States of the United Nations have no absolute
right of neutrality. By Article 41 of the United Nations
Charter they may be under a duty to apply enforcement
measures against a State or States engaged in war, if so called
upon pursuant to a decision by the Security Council. Under
paragraph 5 of Article 2 they are also bound to give every
assistance to the United Nations in any action under the
Charter, and to refrain from giving assistance to any State
against which preventive or enforcement action is being taken
by the Organisation.

------
540
Part 5.-Disputes & Hostile Relations
Neutrality is not, however, completely abolished. Even
where preventive or enforcement action is being taken by the
United Nations Security Council, certain Member States may
not be called upon to apply the measures decided upon by the
Council or may receive special exemptions (_see_ Articles 48
and 50). In this event their status is one of "qualified
"
neutrality inasmuch as they are bound not to assist the
belligerent State against which enforcement measures are
directed, and must also assist the Member States actually
taking the measures (_see_ Article 49). It seems also that where
the " veto " is exercised by a permanent member of the Security
Council so that no preventive or enforcement action is decided
upon with reference to a war, in such case Member States may
remain absolutely neutral towards the belligerents.
Commencement of Neutrality
Immediate notification of neutrality is desirable, and is
regarded as necessary by most States. In the Second World
War, immediately after its outbreak in September, 1939,
almost all neutral States announced their neutrality at once
and specifically communicated the fact to the belligerents.
Certain of these States were then Members of the League of
Nations, and the declarations of neutrality were regarded as
necessary statements of intention not to be bound by the
obligations of the League Covenant.
war
Quasi-Neutrality
States and non-State entities, not participating in a "non-
armed conflict, have a status which yet remains to be
defined by rules of international law.
If the events in the Korean conflict of 1950--1953 supply any
guide, it is clear that there is no rigid or fixed status of quasi-
neutrality as in the case of neutrality in a war proper, but that
the nature of the status must depend on the special
circumstances of the particular conflict concerned.
Moreover, where a "non-war" armed conflict is subject to
the peace enforcement action of the Security Council of the

------
Chap. 18.---Neutrality & Quasi-Neutrality
541
United Nations, or to United Nations " peacekeeping " (_see_
Chapter 19, _post._), the status of a quasi-neutral, whether a
Member State of the United Nations or not, is governed by
the provisions of the United Nations Charter, and by the
terms of any decision or recommendation made by the Security
Council under these provisions, or of any recommendations of
the General Assembly as to such" peacekeeping".
2.-RIGHTS AND DUTIES IN GENERAL OF

(a) NEUTRALS, AND (b) QUASI-NEUTRALS

(a) Rights and Duties in General of Neutral States
The status of neutrality involves rights and duties _inter se_ of
neutral States on the one hand, and of belligerent States on
the other. Rights and duties here are correlative, that is to
say, a right of a neutral State corresponds to a duty of a
belligerent, and a right of a belligerent State to a duty of a
neutral. From the standpoint of either the neutral or the
belligerent State, also, the duties of these States may be
classified as :---



(i) duties of abstention;

(ii) duties of prevention;

(iii) duties of acquiescence.
Applying this classification, the general duties of a neutral
State may be described as follows:---



(i) Abstention.---The neutral State must give no assistance-
direct or indirect---to either belligerent side; for example, it
must not supply troops, or furnish or guarantee loans, or
provide shelter for a belligerent's armed forces.
(ü) Prevention.-The neutral State is under a duty to prevent
within its territory or jurisdiction such activities as the enlist-
ment of troops for belligerent armies, preparations for
hostilities by any belligerent, or warlike measures in its territory
or territorial waters.
1 _See_ Articles 39--51.

------
542
Part 5.-Disputes & Hostile Relations

(iii) Acquiescence. The neutral State must acquiesce in the
acts of belligerent States with respect to the commerce of its
nationals if they are duly warranted by the laws of war, for
example, the seizure of vessels under its flag for the carriage of
contraband, adjudications by Prize Courts, and so on.
Similarly, the duties of belligerent States may be summarised
as:


(i) Abstention.---A belligerent State must not commit warlike
acts on neutral territory or enter into hostilities in neutral
waters or in the airspace above neutral territory, nor may it
interfere with the legitimate intercourse of neutrals with the
enemy, nor may it use neutral territory or waters as a base for
belligerent operations, or as a starting point for an expedition.

(ii) Prevention.---A belligerent State is duty bound to prevent
the ill-treatment of neutral envoys or neutral subjects or injury
to neutral property on enemy territory occupied by it.

(iii) Acquiescence.--A belligerent State must, for instance,
acquiesce in internment by a neutral State of such members of
its armed forces as take refuge in neutral territory, or in the
granting of temporary asylum by neutral ports to hostile
warships so that necessary repairs may be effected.
If a belligerent or a neutral State violates any one of such
duties and the breach results in damage to the other, it is in
general liable for the damage caused and must furnish pecuniary
satisfaction to that State. In the _Alabama Claims Arbitration_
(1872), the arbitrators awarded the United States a sum of
15,500,000 dollars in gold as indemnity in full satisfaction of
all claims subject of the arbitration, arising out of Great
Britain's failure to prevent the construction and fitting out of
The Alabama and other commerce destroyers for use by the
Confederates.
As regards the above-mentioned duties of prevention a
neutral State is not an insurer for the performance of these
duties, or, put another way, these duties are not absolute.
The neutral State is bound only to use the means at its disposal
in fulfilling its obligations; for example, if unable to prevent
a much stronger State from violating its neutrality, it does not

------
Chap. 18.---Neutrality & Quasi-Neutrality
543
become liable to the injured belligerent State for the non-
performance of its duties.
With regard to the several duties of abstention of a belligerent
State mentioned above, one or two important points should be
mentioned. If a neutral State abstains from taking action
against a belligerent violating neutral territory, etc., or if that
neutral State is too weak to prevent such violation, then the
opposing belligerent is entitled to intervene on the neutral
territory, etc. Belligerent warships have a right of innocent
passage through neutral territorial waters, but the right must
not be abused. They may also, for the purpose of refuelling,
repairs, etc., take refuge in neutral ports (although not more
than three at the same time), and here, according to British
practice, may only stay twenty-four hours after noticel from
the neutral State, subject to an extension for sufficient reasons,
for example, weather or urgent repairs. If the time-limit is
exceeded, the ship and crew must be interned.
Reference should also be made to certain other rights and
privileges of belligerent States. Their special rights in regard
to neutral trade and neutral shipping are considered in the
second part of this chapter. In addition to these, belligerents
enjoy the so-called privilege of angary, i.e., of requisitioning
any neutral ships or goods physically within their jurisdiction,
but not brought there voluntarily, subject to the property
being useful in war and being urgently required by them, and
subject to the payment of full compensation. Also, according
to the practice in two World Wars belligerents are, it seems,
entitled to notify war zones on the high seas, and to designate
the safe routes of passage that may be taken by neutral vessels.
Further, in the event of the enemy resorting to illegal warfare,
belligerents may adopt reprisals (i.e., measures otherwise illegal
at international law) irrespective of the fact that injury may
thereby be done to neutrals, provided only, according to British
practice, that such reprisals are justified by the circumstances
1 It is the duty of the neutral State to give such notice as early as possible.
If the goods are within the jurisdiction and have been brought there
voluntarily, reasonable and not full compensation for requisitioning will be
paid to the owner.

------
544
Part 5.-Disputes & Hostile Relations
of the case and do not involve an unreasonable degree of
inconvenience for neutrals, 1
Neutrality does not exclude sympathy between a neutral
State and a belligerent, provided that this sentiment does not
take the active form of concrete assistance to that belligerent.
Similarly, gifts or loans of money by private citizens of the
neutral State to the belligerent or other similar transactions,
or individual enlistments by such private citizens in that
belligerent's armed forces are not prohibited by the rules of
neutrality. Such impartiality as is required of neutrals is
confined to the duties of abstention, prevention, and
acquiescence mentioned above. This distinction between the
neutral State and its citizens has obviously been affected by the
increasing range of State controls over all private transactions,
and over persons. Under the impact of these controls, the
duties of a neutral State must necessarily become more strict
so far as liberty of action by its citizens is concerned. For
example, it is probably now the duty of a neutral State not to
sanction the private export of arms and ammunition.
Unneutral Service2
Traditionally, the doctrine of unneutral service relates to the
duties of neutral citizens in maritime warfare, and was regarded
as an analogue of the doctrine of contraband. Confusion is
due to this analogy, because it seemed to confine unneutral
service to the carriage or transport by neutral vessels of persons
and despatches, which assist one belligerent, and against which
its opponent is empowered to take measures by confiscation
and (if necessary) by destruction of the vessel.
It is, however, a doctrine much broader than this analogy
suggests; nor in these days is it confined to ships at sea, but
must include aircraft, which in time of war are commonly used
* _See_ The Zamora, (1916] 2 A.C. 77.
  2 For a modern discussion of the doctrine, _see_ Stone, Legal Controls of
  International Conflict (1954) Chapter XVIII, and Supplement 1953--1958 (1959)
  pp. 892--893.

------
Chap. 18.-Neutrality & Quasi-Neutrality 545
for the transport of persons important to a belligerent's war
effort. Summing up the doctrine of unneutral service, it may
be laid down that it is the duty of the owners or persons in
charge of a neutral vessel or aircraft not by any acts or conduct
on their part to employ the vessel or aircraft for objects or
purposes (other than carriage of contraband or breach of
blockade?) which may advance the belligerent interests of one
State and injure the same interests of the opponent. For
such acts or conduct, a belligerent who is or may be injuriously
affected thereby, may stop the vessel or aircraft, and remove
therefrom the persons improperly carried, and-in more
serious cases--capture the vessel, and condemn it or certain
portions of its cargo by proceeding before a Prize Court.4
The more usual guilty activities of unneutral service are
transport of members of the enemy armed forces, 3 carriage of
despatches to the enemy, taking a direct part in the hostilities,
operating under charter to the enemy, and the transmission of
intelligence in the interests of the enemy.

(b) Rights and Duties in General of Quasi-Neutrals
States and non-State entities which do not participate in
"non-war" armed conflicts are not subject, it is clear, to the
same stringent duties as neutral States in a war proper, nor
have they rights against the contestants as plenary as the rights
of neutrals.
1 During the Second World War, the refusal of the British authorities to
grant navicerts or ship warrants (_see below_ pp. 553--554) for particular
neutral vessels, because of undesirable passengers or undesirable members of the
crew, left little practical room for cases of unneutral service by the transport of
persons important to the enemy's war effort; _cf._ Medlicott, The Economic Blockade,
in the series "History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Civil Series"
(edited, W. K. Hancock), Vol. I (1952) pp. 450--452, and Vol. II (1959) pp. 161
_et seq._
_See below_, in section 3 of this Chapter.
3 The category of persons, the carriage of whom may involve an unneutral
service, includes serving members of the armed forces, reservists subject to
orders of mobilisation, and, _semble_, now, scientists important to the enemy's
war effort.
* For the effect of Chapter III of the Declaration of London, 1909, in
  laying down different penal consequences according to the nature of the act
  of unneutral service, _see_ Stone, _op. cit._, Chapter XVIII, section IV.

------
546
Part 5.---Disputes & Hostile Relations
Practice supplies, as yet, no conclusive guide as to the extent
of the rights and duties involved.
However, the contestants and quasi-neutrals concerned may
always agree as to the extent of their respective rights and
duties, _inter se_. As to one special point, the right of quasi-
neutrals to protect the lives and property of nationals, and to
evacuate them, if necessary, seems not to be disputed by the
great majority of States.
In the case of an armed conflict which is subject to the peace
enforcement action of the United Nations Security Council,
the rights and duties of quasi-neutrals whether Member States
of the United Nations or not may be determined by decision
or recommendation of the Security Council. The matter may
also be governed by recommendations of the General Assembly,
e.g., so far as United Nations " peacekeeping" is concerned
(_see_ Chapter 19, _post._); these have permissive, although not
binding force.
Mention should be made of paragraph 6 of Article 2 of the
United Nations Charter, under which the Organisation is to
ensure that non-Member States shall conform to the "Prin-
ciples " laid down in the Article for the maintenance of peace
and security; and one of such" Principles " (_see_ paragraph 5)
is to give the United Nations assistance in any action under the
Charter, and to refrain from giving assistance to any State
against which the United Nations is taking peace enforcement
action.
3.-ECONOMIC WARFARE AND BLOCKADE: IMPACT UPON

(a) NEUTRALS, AND (b) QUASI-NEUTRALS
During the nineteenth century and until the advent of total
war in 1914, and again in 1939, neutral trading and shipping
relations with belligerents were regulated largely by the rules
of contraband and blockade.
These rules were, in essence, rooted in a limited conception
of the economic pressure which could be applied to weaken a
belligerent's capacity for war, the main concern of a contestant

------
Chap. 18.---Neutrality & Quasi-Neutrality
547
who resorted to contraband interception, or to blockade, being
to interrupt the flow by sea of vital goods, which might help
the enemy in its war effort. There was also an assumption
underlying the rules that supplies from neutral States would
always be channelled directly to coasts or ports of the particular
enemy belligerent concerned and not by indirect routes.
However, in the course of the First World War, and again
during the Second World War, Great Britain, for whom these
Wars were life and death struggles, was obliged to challenge
the validity of so limited a conception of economic pressure
and of so fallacious an assumption, and accordingly departed
from the traditional nineteenth century rules of contraband and
blockade (_see below_). Besides the traditional system was
ineffective to deal with stratagems such as the smuggling by
neutral seamen of small contraband objects or articles, which
might nevertheless be vital to the enemy war effort, and other
forms of assistance to the enemy, for example, the transport of
neutral technicians for employment in enemy war production.
Moreover, in the Second World War, Great Britain and
then the United States (after its entry into the War) adopted
far-reaching theories of economic warfare, which were carried
into practical execution for the first time on a considerable
scale. Under the new concept of economic warfare, economic
pressure was not to be limited primarily to the traditional
expedients of contraband interception and blockade, but was
to be conducted by multifarious other methods and operations,
in order effectively to weaken the enemy's economic and finan-
cial sinews, and therefore his ability to continue the struggle;
for example, through such procedures as the use of "navi-
certs" (_see below_ p. 553) to control " at source
overseas neutral countries to enemy and European neutral
territory, the pre-emption or so-called "preclusive purchase
of essential products or materials, the prevention or control of
enemy exports, the withholding of credits to neutral suppliers
and other forms of financial pressure, and the compulsory
rationing of neutral States in essential products and materials
so as not to allow an accumulation of excess commodities which
might be exported to the enemy, or which might tempt the
exports from
>

548
Part 5.-Disputes & Hostile Relations
enemy to invade these States. By 1944--1945, the Allies were
able to go so far as to make European neutrals practically
withhold all exports of essential products or materials to
Germany.
Moreover, as the War progressed, the purpose was not merely
to deny vital goods to the enemy and to ration neutrals, but to
conserve all available supplies of scarce products for the Allies.
An almost unlimited range of techniques and expedients, not
restricted to contraband and blockade controls, was adopted
in the waging of this economic warfare, as is made plain in
Professor Medlicott's searching survey of this type of warfare
during the Second World War.
If any conclusion is justified by the practice of the Second
World War as examined in this survey, it is that in conducting
economic warfare, a belligerent is now entitled under interna-
tional law to subject neutrals to any kind of pressure or restric-
tion necessary, either on the one hand to strengthen itself, or
on the other hand to weaken the enemy economically and
financially, provided :---

(1) that the inconvenience to neutrals is,
as far as possible, minimised; and (2) that the belligerent con-
cerned stops short of causing actual grave injury to neutrals
(for example, denying them the bare minimum of food and
other necessaries).
The new concept of economic warfare, as thus put into
practice, with its wide permissible limits, has by reflex action
necessarily had the result, too, of removing a number of the
qualifications upon the doctrines of contraband and blockade,
which originated in the period when economic pressure in time
of war was conceived in the narrowest of terms. It is perhaps
not today seriously disputed that the modifications to these
two doctrines, made in the course of two World Wars, will endure.
Accordingly, contraband and blockade as separate doctrines
of the laws of war and neutrality, must now be treated as
1 _See_ The Economic Blockade, Vol. I (1952) and Vol. II (1959) in the series,
History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Civil Series " (edited,
W. K. Hancock). Professor Medlicott makes it clear that the concept of
economic warfare included attacks on the enemy's economy by sabotage
behind the enemy front, and bombing of factories and communications; _see_
Vol. II at pp. 630 et seg.

------
Chap. 18.---Neutrality & Quasi-Neutrality 549
special topics within the larger field of economic warfare. It
should not, however, be overlooked that in a special case, an
operation of blockade may involve primarily naval or military
aspects, rather than those of an economic character.
Although from time to time, new expedients of economic
warfare were justified ostensibly on the ground of reprisals for
violations of international law by the enemy, practice through-
out the Second World War showed that Allied belligerents did
not rest the validity of economic warfare solely on this narrow
basis.
Contraband
Contraband is the designation for such goods as the
belligerents consider objectionable because they may assist
the enemy in the conduct of war.
The importance of the conception of contraband is due to
certain rules enunciated by the Declaration of Paris, 1856,
which are now recognised to be part of international law.
The effect of these may be stated as follows :---Belligerents
may seize enemy contraband goods which are being carried
to an enemy destination on neutral ships, or neutral contraband
goods which are being carried to an enemy destination on
enemy ships. These rights of seizure are conceded by inter-
national law in view of the obvious necessity for belligerents,
in the interests of self-preservation, to prevent the importation
of articles which may strengthen the enemy.
A distinction is drawn between absolute and relative contra-
band. Articles clearly of a warlike or military character are
considered to be absolute contraband; for example, arms of
all kinds, military clothing, camp equipment, machinery for the
manufacture of munitions, and gun-mountings. Articles useful
for purposes of peace as well as of war are considered to be rela-

2 The same principles are presumably applicable to carriage by air in
neutral or enemy aircraft, although there appears to be no reported Prize
Court case as to the condemnation of aircraft on such grounds.

tive contraband, for example, food, fuel, field-glasses, railway
rolling stock, and if intercepted on their way to the enemy
Government or to the enemy forces are treated as absolute
contraband and are liable to seizure by a hostile belligerent.
It is doubtful if the distinction is now of any practical value.
Besides absolute and relative contraband, there is a third
class of goods known as "free articles ", which must never
be declared contraband, inasmuch as they are not susceptible
to use in war; for example, chinaware and glass, soap, paint
and colours, and fancy goods.
So far States have not reached general agreement on what
articles fall within each of the three categories mentioned,
except that by universal admission instruments of war or
warlike materials are absolute contraband. Even jurists and
Prize Court judges have seldom been in accord on the matter,
and the practice of the States shows little uniformity and many
anomalies.
An attempt was made by an instrument known as the
Declaration of London, 1909, to draw up agreed lists of goods
in the three classes, but the Declaration did not come into
force for want of ratifications. Both in the First and Second
World Wars the belligerents declared goods to be absolute or
relative contraband which in the nineteenth century were
universally acknowledged to be non-contraband. Thus almost
overnight the pedantic opinions of text-writers, the carefully
drafted clauses in treaties, and the weighty judgments of Lord
Stowell and other Prize Court judges were relegated to a back
store-room, while the belligerents were restrained only by
considerations of policy and expediency from declaring every
type of article and material to be contraband. The very
extensive lists of contraband drawn up by Great Britain in
both wars were eloquent testimony to the desuetude of former
rules and usages. By the time of the Second World War,
both by practice and according to British judicial decisions, the
Declaration of London was regarded as devoid of any authority.
The impact of " total war", at first in 1914, and then with
much greater effect in 1939, completely revolutionised the
conditions of warfare. In view of the enormous range of

------
Chap. 18.---Neutrality & Quasi-Neutrality 551
equipment required for modern war, of the much more
advanced use of scientific weapons and instruments, and of
the possible production of ersatz or substitute war materials,
it could scarcely be predicated of any article or substance that
it did not have a warlike use. For the sake of self-preservation,
belligerents had necessarily to adapt themselves to these
exigencies, and the old rules and usages as to contraband were
disregarded by them when official lists of contraband covering
every conceivable kind of article or material were drawn up.
Destination of Contraband ; Doctrine of Continuous Voyage or
Continuous Transportation
Usually the simplest case of seizure of contraband is one
in which the goods are clearly of hostile destination. A
number of cases invariably arise in which the purpose of
supplying the enemy is sought to be achieved more indirectly,
as where citizens in a neutrai State adjacent to enemy territory
purchase contraband for resale to the enemy in order to avoid
interception at sea.
In circumstances such as these the doctrine of continuous
voyage or continuous transportation becomes applicable.
This consists in treating an adventure which involves the
carriage of goods in the first instance to a neutral port, and then
to some ulterior and hostile destination as being for certain
purposes one transportation only to an enemy destination,
with all the consequences that would attach were the neutral
port not interposed. Accordingly, if these goods are contra-
band, they are liable to seizure. The doctrine was expounded
in classical terms by Lord Stowell in The Maria.1
In the American Civil War, the United States Supreme Court
applied the doctrine systematically to nearly all cases of breach
of blockade or of contraband. Furthermore, United States
Courts took it upon themselves to draw presumptions as to
hostile destination from all kinds of unexplained facts, for
example, if the bill of lading were made out to order, or the
manifest of cargo did not disclose the whole cargo, or a con-
1(1805), 5 Ch. Rob. 365.

Part 5.---Disputes & Hostile Relations
signee were not named, or if the ship or cargo were consigned
to a firm known to have acted as an enemy agent, or if there
were a notorious trade in contraband between a neutral port
and enemy territory.
Till 1909, it was nevertheless doubtful whether the doctrine
was subject to general approval; at all events, it was not
supported by a uniform practice. However, the Declaration
of London, 1909, which as mentioned above did not come into
force, laid it down that the doctrine applied to absolute contra-
band, but did not apply to conditional contraband except in a
war against an enemy possessing no seaboard.
In the First World War, the doctrine received its fullest
executive and judicial application by Great Britain. British
Orders-in-Council enunciated the doctrine in the widest terms,
going far beyond the terms of the Declaration of London, 1909.
British Courts also applied the doctrine systematically to a
large number of cases, and in The Kim? it was declared that:---

. . the doctrine of continuous voyage or transportation,
both in relation to carriage by sea and to carriage over land, had
become part of the law of nations at the commencement of
the present war, in accordance with the principles of recognised
legal decisions, and with the views of a great body of modern
jurists, and also with the practice of nations in recent maritime
warfare".
As illustrating the wide scope of the doctrine the following
principles were accepted by British Courts :---

(1) that contra-
band goods might be seized on their way to a neutral country
if there existed an intention to forward them to an enemy
destination after there undergoing a process of manufacture;

(2) that, notwithstanding that the shippers of contraband
goods might be innocent of any intention of an ultimate
hostile destination, yet if on the consignees' side the goods were
in fact purchased for delivery to the enemy they were liable to
confiscation.
The Courts of other belligerents also accepted and applied
the doctrine of continuous transportation.

Chap. 18.-Neutrality & Quasi-Neutrality 553
In practice, the system of cargo and ship" navicerts ",' i.e.
certificates given by a diplomatic or consular or other represen-
tative in a neutral country to a neutral shipper, testifying, as the
case might be, that the cargo on board a neutral vessel was not
liable to seizure as contraband, or that the voyage of a particu-
lar ship was innocent, left little room for the application of
the doctrine of continuous transportation. "Navicerts"
were first introduced by the Government of Queen Elizabeth
in 1590, but were not used on a large scale in modern con-
ditions of maritime warfare until 1916 when they were in-
stituted by the Allies. " Navicerts" were again introduced
on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Vessels
using "navicerts" were normally exempted from search,
although there was no complete guarantee against interception
or seizure, which might take place because of the discovery of
fresh facts or because the destination of the cargo had become
enemy occupied territory. A " navicert " might, of course, be
refused on grounds which would not be sufficient to justify
belligerent seizure of a ship or its cargo, and subsequent con-
demnation by a Prize Court (_see below_). For example, at
certain stages of the war, navicerts were, temporarily, not
granted for the consignment to neutral territory of commodities
needed by the Allies, such as rubber and tin.
Originally the mere absence of a "navicert " was not in
itself a ground for seizure or condemnation. However, after
the occupation of France and the Low Countries by Germany
in June, 1940, changed the whole circumstances of the Allied
maritime blockade, Britain issued the Reprisals Order-in-
Council (dated July 31, 1940), the effect of which was:---


(a) that goods might become liable to seizure in the absence
of a "navicert" to cover them; and (b) that there was a
presumption that "unnavicerted" goods had an enemy destina-
tion. The Order did not make "navicerts " compulsory in
every sense for neutral shippers, but it heightened the risk of
interception and seizure of cargoes by putting the onus on the
1" Aircerts " and "mailcerts " for goods sent from neutral countries by
air and mail, were also introduced.

shipper of establishing the innocence of the shipment. The
legality of the Order was of course questioned, but it was
justified as a legitimate act of reprisalsi to simplify the
blockade, and to put increased pressure on the enemy, and also
possibly as a method of regulating neutral trade through a
system of passes.
Neutral vessels were also required to equip themselves with
ship warrants, which were granted upon covenants, inter alia,
not to engage in contraband trading, to search the ship for
smuggled contraband, etc. In the absence of a ship warrant,
" navicerts" might be refused, and bunkering and other
facilities at Allied ports withheld.
By the system of "navicerts " and ship warrants, British
authorities were able inter alia to police the smuggling of small
contraband objects or articles, the employment of undesirable
seamen, and the transport of technicians who might assist the
enemy war effort.
Consequences of Carriage of Contraband ; Condemnation by
Prize Courts
Contraband is, in the circumstances mentioned above, liable
to seizure, and under certain conditions even the vessel
carrying the contraband cargo is liable to seizure. Seizure
by a belligerent is admissible only in the open sea or in the
belligerent's own territorial waters; seizure in neutral terri-
torial waters would be a violation of neutrality.
According to British and Continental practice, the right of
a belligerent State to seize contraband cargoes or vessels
carrying them is not an absolute one but requires confirmation
by the adjudication of a Prize Court established by that State.
1 The right of retaliation by a belligerent for a violation of international
law by the enemy is a right of the belligerent, not a concession by the neutral.
_Cf._ as to reprisals, as a justification for extensions of the doctrine of contra-
band, Medlicott, _op. cit._, Vol. I at p. 9.
2 The statistics 1943--1945 show that at least 25 per cent of applications
for " navicerts " were refused.
8 "Navicerts" were refused and ship warrants withdrawn if precautions were
not taken by the shipping company and masters concerned to prevent such
smuggling.

Chap. 18.-Neutrality & Quasi-Neutrality
555
The origin of Prize Courts and of Prize Law goes back to the
Middle Ages when there were frequent captures of piratical
vessels. In England, for example, the Court of Admiralty
would inquire into the authority of the captor and into the
nationality of the captured vessel and of the owners of her goods.
This practice was extended to captures made in time of war and
it gradually became a recognised customary rule of international
law that in time of war the maritime belligerents should be
obliged to set up Courts to decide whether captures were
lawful or not. These Courts were called Prize Courts. They
are not international Courts but municipal Courts, although
they apply international law largely. Every State is bound
by international law to enact only such regulations, or statutes,
to govern the operation of Prize Courts, as are in conformity
with international law.
The structure of Prize Courts varies in different countries.
In certain States, Prize Courts are mixed bodies consisting
of Judges and administrative officials, but in the British Empire
and the United States they are exclusively judicial tribunals.
If the Prize Court upholds the legitimacy of the seizure, the
cargo or vessel is declared to be "good prize" and to be
confiscated to the captor's State. The decree of condemnation
is accompanied by an order for sale under which the purchaser
acquires a title internationally valid. Thenceforward, what
becomes of the prize is no concern of international law, but is
solely a matter for municipal law to determine.
Seized ships or goods in the custody of the Prize Court
pending a decision as to their condemnation or release, may be
requisitioned subject to certain limitations, one of which is that
there is a real issue to be tried as to the question of
condemnation.
For the law and procedure followed in British Prize Courts
the reader is referred to standard works, such as Colombos,
The Law of Prize.
Blockade
The law as to blockade represents a further restriction on
the freedom of neutral States to trade with belligerents.

------
556
Part 5.---Disputes & Hostile Relations
A blockade occurs when a belligerent bars access to the
enemy coast or part of it for the purpose of preventing ingress
or egress of vessels or aircraft of all nations. The blockade
is an act of war, and if duly carried out in accordance with the
rules of warfare, is effective to deny freedom of passage to the
shipping or aircraft of other States. Under the Declaration
of Paris, 1856, which is declaratory of prior customary inter-
national law, a blockade is binding only if effective, and the
effectiveness of a blockade is conditioned by the maintenance
of such a force by the belligerent as is "sufficient really to
prevent access to the enemy coast".
Ships which break a blockade by entering or leaving the
blockaded area are liable to seizure by the belligerent operating
the blockade in the same way as contraband cargoes, and after
capture must be sent to a port for adjudication on their
character as lawful prize. Generally, the cargoes carried by
such ships will also suffer condemnation by a Prize Court
unless those who shipped the goods prove to the Court's
satisfaction that the shipment was made before they knew or
could have known of the blockade.
The practice of States varies greatly as to what is deemed
to constitute a breach of blockade. For instance, practice
is not uniform on the point whether a neutral vessel must
have actual formal notice of the blockade. According to
Anglo-American juristic opinion and practice, it is sufficient
to establish presumptively that those in charge of the neutral
vessel knew that a blockade had been established. The com-
mander of a neutral vessel who sails for an enemy port knowing
that it is blockaded at the beginning of the voyage ought to
expect that it will be in the same state when he arrives in the
vicinity of the port; and anything which can be proved to affect
him with knowledge at the date of departure, for example,
publication of a declaration of blockade, will render the vessel
and its cargo liable to the penalties for breach of blockade.
According to the French theory, the neutral vessel is not affected
by presumptions as to continuance or cesser of blockade, but
the commander of the vessel on approaching the blockaded area
is entitled to individual warning from one of the blockading

------
Chap. 18.-Neutrality & Quasi-Neutrality 557
squadrons, the fact of the notification being entered in the
vessel's log-book with specific mention of the hour, date, and
place of notification. It is only for subsequent attempts to
enter the blockaded area that the neutral vessel is liable to seizure.
Apart from the matter of actual or constructive notice to
neutral vessels, it is an established rule of international law
that a blockade must be properly declared and notified to
neutral States with a specific statement as to the date when the
blockade begins and the geographical limits of the coastline
to which access is barred. Secondly, in accordance with the
rule of effectiveness, the blockade must be maintained by a
sufficient and properly disposed force, rendering ingress or
egress by other vessels a matter of material danger. This
principle is supported by authoritative British judicial pro-
nouncements. Thus Dr. Lushington declared in The Franciskał
that:---

(the blockaded place) must be watched by a force
sufficient to render the egress or ingress dangerous; or, in other
words, save under peculiar circumstances, as fogs, violent
winds, and some necessary absences, the force must be sufficient
to render the capture of vessels attempting to go in or come
out most probable".
Similarly, Lord Chief Justice Cockburn stated in Geipel v.
Smith2;
" In the eye of the law, a blockade is effective if the enemies,
ships are in such numbers and position as to render running
the blockade a matter of danger, although some vessels may
succeed in getting through ".
The size of the blockading force and the distance at which it
operates from the blockaded coast are alike immaterial,
provided this test of danger to neutral vessels be satisfied.
Thus in the Crimean War in 1854, a single British cruiser
commanding the one navigable approach to the Russian port
of Riga at a distance of one hundred and twenty miles was
deemed sufficient to constitute a blockade of the port. United
States judicial decisions and practice are to the same effect
as the British authorities.

Part 5.---Disputes & Hostile Relations
· In the First World War, the British Navy enforced a " long-
distance" blockade of Germany through ships and squadrons
operating often more than one thousand miles from German
ports. The objections raised to this type of blockade were
that it extended across the approaches to the ports and
coastline of neighbouring neutral countries and that it was in
many respects ineffective. It was first instituted in 1915 as a
reprisal for the German decision to attack British and Allied
merchantmen in the waters surrounding the British Isles
without regard for the personal safety of the passengers or
Under British Orders-in-Council, neutral vessels
carrying goods of presumed enemy destination, origin, or
ownership could be required to proceed to a British port to
discharge their cargoes, and might be forbidden to move to a
German port. If neutral vessels under colour of permission
to proceed to a neutral port, sailed for a German port, they
were liable to seizure and condemnation if subsequently
caught. Such a blockade was probably not justified according
to the rules followed in the nineteenth century, either as a
retaliatory measure or as a blockade in the strict sense of that
term. The British Government, however, justified the " long-
distance" blockade of Germany by reference to the changed
conditions of war, stating that a modern blockade could only
be effective by covering commerce with the enemy passing
through neutral ports. The "long-distance" blockade was
re-instituted in 1939 in the Second World War, and its rational
justification was likewise the necessity for waging " total"
economic warfare against the enemy. In both wars, France
took action similar to that of Great Britain. Without Great
Britain's predominant naval power in relation to the enemy, the
blockade could not have been enforced.
Belligerent Right of Visit and Search
Co-extensive with the right of seizing contraband or of
capturing ships in breach of blockade, belligerents have by
Medlicott, _op. cit._, Vol. I at p. 4, has pointed out that the traditional
blockade presupposed "naval action close to an enemy's coasts", and had
" little relevance to a war in which modern artillery, mines, and submarines
made such action impossible, and in which the enemy was so placed geographi-
cally that he could use adjacent neutral ports as a channel for supplies".
Apart from the ground of reprisals for illegal enemy activities.
2

------
Chap. 18.--- Neutrality & Quasi-Neutrality 559
long established custom the right to visit and search neutral
vessels on the high seas in order to determine the nature of the
cargo and to check the destination and neutral character of
the vessel. This right must be exercised so as to cause neutral
vessels the least possible inconvenience. If suspicious circum-
stances are disclosed in the case of a particular neutral vessel,1
that vessel may be taken into port for more extensive inquiry
and if necessary for adjudication before a Prize Court.
Formerly the right of visit and search was qualified by severe
restrictions, designed to protect neutrals from unnecessary or
burdensome interference with their commerce. In both the
First and Second World Wars, the exigencies of " total war'
caused belligerents to disregard these limitations. Contrary to
the rules that search should precede capture and that it should
generally not go further than an examination of the ship's
papers and crew and cursory inspection of the cargo, neutral
vessels could be required to call at contraband-control bases, 2
or if intercepted on the high seas might be sent to port for
thorough searching even in the absence of suspicious cir-
cumstances, considerable delays occurring while the vessels
were so detained. On the British side, this practice of searching
in port instead of on the high seas was justified on three main
grounds:---

(a) the growth in size of modern cargo vessels,
rendering concealment easier and a thorough search more
lengthy and difficult; (b) the danger from submarines while the
search was being conducted; (c) the need for considering the
circumstances of the shipment in conjunction with civilian
authorities, for example, of the Ministry of Economic Warfare.
Several international law purists criticised the British defence
of the practice, but the overpowering circumstances which
rendered the practice necessary could not be gainsaid.
1 There is a right to detain, in addition to visiting and searching, provided
that there are reasonable grounds for suspicion, appearing in connection with
the search; _see_ The Mim, (1947] P. 115.
* _See_ Medlicott, _op. cit._, Vol. II at p. 154. Search would also include the
  examination of mail, and ascertaining whether any passengers possibly useful
  to the enemy, e.g. technicians, were being transported.

Part 5.---Disputes & Hostile Relations
This inconvenience to neutral vessels could, for all practical
purposes, be avoided by obtaining a "navicert ".1
Economic Warfare and Quasi-Neutrals
Generally speaking, in the absence of a specific agreement
that belligerent rights shall be applicable to a non-war armed
conflict, a contestant cannot, in regard to quasi-neutrals, resort
to contraband interception or to blockade. Yet in the course
of the India-Pakistan conflict, in September, 1966, measures
closely resembling blockade were adopted, although not
recognised as such by third States, save to the extent of making
arrangements to overcome difficulties as to the passage of
their shipping.
However, apart from matters of contraband or blockade,
contestants can have recourse to any means of economic
pressure, notwithstanding that this may cause damage or
inconvenience to quasi-neutrals, although there is possibly a
duty to minimise the damage or inconvenience as far as possible.
Where the conflict is one subject to the peace enforcement
jurisdiction of the United Nations Security Council, quasi-
neutrals, whether Member States of the United Nations or not,
must submit to any measures of economic warfare3 decided by
the Security Council, although if they find themselves affected
by special economic problems arising out of the action taken
by the Security Council, they may consult that body regarding
a solution of such problems (_see_ Article 50 of the United
Nations Charter). United Nations "peacekeeping " opera-
tions (_see_ Chapter 19, _post._), raise very different considerations,
as here we are in the area primarily of General Assembly
recommendations, which leave room for States to opt in, or
out of support for economic measures in aid of" peacekeeping".
_See above_ pp. 553--554.
2 As to the coastal control operated by the French Government 1956--59
(of the nature of a quasi-blockade), with regard to the Algerian Conflict, _see_
R. Pinto, Hague Recueil des Cours, 1965, Vol. I, pp. 546--548. In the course of
the "incursion" into Cambodia (Khmer Republic) in May, 1970, United
States and South Vietnamese warships cut off supply routes by sea to a stretch
of the Cambodian coastline in what appeared to be a partial blockade; how-
ever, the existence of a blockade was officially denied.
• This could include the "complete or partial interruption of economic
relations " (_see_ Article 41 of the Charter).
