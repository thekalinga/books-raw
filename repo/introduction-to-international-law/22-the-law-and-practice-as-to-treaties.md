CHAPTER 15
THE LAW AND PRACTICE AS TO TREATIES
1.--NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF TREATIES
Prior to 1969 the law of treaties consisted for the most part of
customary rules of international law. These rules were to a
large extent codified and reformulated in the Vienna Conven-
tion on the Law of Treaties, concluded on May 22, 1969
(referred to, _post._, in the present chapter as "the Vienna Con-
vention "?). Apart from such codification, the Convention
contained much that was new and that represented develop-
ment of international law, while also a number of provisions
resulted from the reconciliation of divergent views and practices.
The Vienna Convention was not however intended as a com-
plete code of treaty law, and in the preamble it is in fact
affirmed thai rules of customary international law will continue
to govern questions not regulated by the provisions of the
Convention.
A treaty may be defined, in accordance with the definition
adopted in Article 2 of the Convention, as an agreement
whereby two or more States establish or seek to establish a
relationship between themselves governed by international law.
So long as an agreement between States is attested, any kind of
instrument or document, or any oral exchange between States
involving undertakings may constitute a treaty, irrespective
of the form or circumstances of its conclusion. Indeed, the
term "treaty
treaty" may be regarded as nomen generalissimum in
international law, and can include an agreement between
international organisations _inter se_, or between an inter-
1 In the footnotes to this chapter, the Convention will also be referred to as
the Vienna Convention", while the abbreviation "Draft Arts. I.L.C."
will denote the Draft Articles on the law of treaties drawn up by the Inter-
national Law Commission, and contained in Chapter II of its Report on the
Work of its 18th Session in 1966 (these Draft Articles were used as a basic
text by the Vienna Conference of 1968--1969 which drew up the Convention).

Conference, _see_ R. D. Kearney and R. E. Dalton, " The Treaty on Treaties",

national organisation on the one hand, and a State or States
on the other, although it should be borne in mind that the
provisions of the Vienna Convention do not apply to such other
instruments, but are confined to treaties between States, con-
cluded in a written form. 1
At the same time, merely considering the treaty as an agree-
ment without more is to over-simplify its functions and signifi-
cance in the international domain. In point of fact, the treaty
is the main instrument which the international community
possesses for the purpose of initiating or developing inter-
national co-operation. In national domestic law, the private
citizen has a large variety of instruments from which to choose
for executing some legal act or for attesting a transaction, for
example, contracts, conveyances, leases, licences, settlements,
acknowledgments, and so on, each specially adapted to the
purpose in hand. In the international sphere, the treaty has
to do duty for almost every kind of legal act, or transaction,
ranging from a mere bilateral bargain between States to such a
fundamental measure as the multilateral constituent instrument
of a major international organisation (e.g., the United Nations
Charter of 1945).
1 Article 3 of the Vienna Convention provides nevertheless that the fact
that the Convention does not apply to agreements between States and non-
State entities, or between non-State entities themselves, or to unwritten
agreements is not to affect :---

(a) the legal force of such agreements; (b) the
application to them of any rules in the Convention to which they would be
subject under international law apart from the Convention; and (c) the applica-
tion of the Convention to the relations of States as between themselves under
agreements to which non-State entities may also be parties.
2 For treatments of the subject of treaties, _see_ Rosenne, The Law of Treaties
(1970); Greig, International Law (1970), pp. 356--395; Kaye Holloway, Modern
Trends in Treaty Law (1967); Ingrid Detter, Essays on the Law of Treaties
(1967). The United Nations publication, Laws and Practices concerning the
Conclusion of Treaties (1953) is a valuable compilation of State practice, with a
bibliography. For a selected bibliography on the law of treaties, _see_ the
Vienna Conference document, A/CONF.39/4.
3 Unilateral acts: The difference between treaties proper and certain
unilateral acts, commonly recognised in international practice, should be
noted. As to unilateral acts, _see_ Schwarzenberger, International Law, Vol. I
(3rd Edition, 1957), at pp. 548--561, and Manual of International Law (5th
Edition, 1967), at pp. 171--3, and Dr. E. Suy, Les Actes juridiques unilatéraux
en droit international public (1962). These include acts of protest, notification,
renunciation, acceptance, and recognition, and serve the following purposes,
inter alia:---

(a) assent to obligations; (b) cognition of situations; (c) declaration
of policy; (d) notice to preserve rights; (e) reservation, in respect to a possible
liability.

------
Chap. 15.-Practice as to Treaties
399
In nearly all cases, the object of a treaty is to impose binding
obligations on the States who are parties to it. Many
writers on the theory of international law have put the question
---why do treaties have such binding force ? Perhaps the only
answer to this query is that international law declares that
duly made treaties create binding obligations for the States
parties. Certain theorists, for example, Anzilotti, have rested
the binding force of treaties on the Latin maxim _pacta sunt
servanda_, or in other words that States are bound to carry out
in good faith the obligations they have assumed by treaty."
Once a State has bound itself by agreement in a treaty, it is
not entitled to withdraw from its obligations without the
consent of the other States parties. In 1871, Great Britain,
France, Italy, Prussia, Russia, Austria, and Turkey subscribed to
the following Declaration made at a Conference in London:---
-
That the Powers recognise it an essential principle of the
Law of Nations that no Power can liberate itself from the
engagements of a treaty nor modify the stipulations thereof,
unless with the consent of the contracting parties by means of
an amicable understanding".
Treaties proper must be distinguished from a contract
between a State and an alien citizen or corporation; although
in ultimate analysis such a contract may raise questions of
international concern between the contracting State and the
State to which the citizen or corporation belongs, it is not a
treaty, and is not subject to the rules of international law
affecting treaties.
One further point should be mentioned. The future law
and practice of treaties will have to include rules relating to
agreements on international matters made by international
institutions, whether _inter se_, or with States, or perhaps even
1 _Cf._ Vienna Convention, 3rd recital of preamble (affirming that the prin-
ciples of free consent, good faith, and _pacta sunt servanda_ are "universally
recognised '), and Article 26 (all treaties are binding on the parties thereto,
and must be performed by them in good faith).

93 at p. 112. As to what instruments are not treaties, _see_ Myers, American
Journal of International Law (1957), Vol. 51, pp. 596--605. A League of
Nations mandate is a treaty; South West Africa Cases, Preliminary Objections,

with individuals. With the establishment of the United
Nations and the "specialised agencies " (_see_ Chapter 19,
below), the number of such transactions is rapidly increasing.
2.-FORMS AND TERMINOLOGY
In regard to the forms and terminology of modern treaties
the present-day practice is far from systematic, and suffers
from a lack of uniformity. This is due to several factors,
principally the survival of old diplomatic traditions and forms
not easily adaptable to the modern international life and to a
reluctance on the part of States to standardise treaty usage.
The principal forms in which treaties are concluded are as
follows:---



(i) Heads of States form. In this case the treaty is drafted
as an agreement between Sovereigns or Heads of State (for
example, the British Crown, the President of the United States)
and the obligations are expressed to bind them as " High
Contracting Parties". This form is not now frequently used,
and is reserved for special cases of Conventions, for example,
consular Conventions, and the more solemn kinds of treaties.
(ü) Inter-governmental form. The treaty is drafted as an
agreement between Governments. The difference between this
and the previous form is not a matter of substance; usually,
however, the inter-governmental form is employed for technical
or non-political agreements. One notable exception to this
rule was the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Alliance, 1902, which
was expressed to be made between the Government of Great
Britain and the Government of Japan as Contracting Parties.

(iii) Inter-State form. The treaty is drafted expressly or
impliedly as an agreement between States. The signatories
are then most often referred to as "the Parties" (_see_, e.g. the
North Atlantic Security Treaty of April 4, 1949).

(iv) A. treaty may be negotiated and signed as between
Ministers of the respective countries concerned, generally the
respective Ministers of Foreign Affairs.
1 As to this phrase, _see_ Philippson v. Imperial Airways, Lid., (1939) A.C. 332.

------
Chap. 15.---Practice as to Treaties
401


(v) A treaty may be an inter-departmental agreement, con-
cluded between representatives of particular Government
Departments, for example, between representatives of the
respective Customs Administrations of the countries concerned.

(vi) A treaty may be made between the actual political
heads of the countries concerned, for example, the Munich
Agreement of September, 1938, which was signed by the British
and French Premiers, Mr. Chamberlain and M. Daladier, and
by the German and Italian Leaders, Hitler and Mussolini.1
The form in which treaties are concluded does not in any
way affect their binding character. To take an extreme
illustration of this principle it is not even necessary that a
treaty be in writing. An oral declaration in the nature of a
promise made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of one country
on behalf of his country to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of
another and in a matter within his competence and authority
may be as binding as a formal written treaty.2 International
law does not as yet require established forms for treaties, and
here content and substance are of more importance.3
Treaties go under a variety of names, some of which indicate
a difference in procedure or a greater or a lesser degree of
formality. Thus besides the term " treaty" itself, the following
titles have been given :---
 (1) Convention. (2) Protocol. (3)
Agreement. (4) Arrangement. (5) Procès-Verbal. (6) Statute.

(7) Declaration. (8) Modus Vivendi. (9) Exchange of Notes
(or of Letters). (10) Final Act. (11) General Act. Each of
these titles will be commented on in turn. As to the term
treaty" itself, this is given as a rule to formal agreements
relative to peace, alliance, or the cession of territory, or some
other fundamental matter.
1 To this list may be added military treaties made between opposing
commanders-in-chief, e.g., the Korean Armistice Agreement of July 27, 1953.
Another special case is that of a Concordat, i.e., an agreement between the
Pope and a Head of State; _see_ Oppenheim, International Law, Vol. I (8th
Edition, 1955), p. 252, and Satow's Guide to Diplomatic Practice (4th Edition,
1957), pp. 343--344.

Part 4.--International Transactions

(1) Convention
This is the term ordinarily reserved for a proper formal
instrument of a multilateral character. The term also includes
the instruments adopted by the organs of international institu-
tions, for example, by the International Labour Conference
and the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisa-
tion. 1

(2) Protocol
This signifies an agreement less formal than a treaty or
Convention proper and which is generally never in the Heads
of State form. The term covers the following instruments:---


(a) An instrument subsidiary to a Convention, and drawn
up by the same negotiators. Sometimes also called a Protocol
of Signature, such a Protocol deals with ancillary matters such
as the interpretation of particular clauses of the Convention,
any supplementary provisions of a minor character, formal
clauses not inserted in the Convention, or reservations by
particular signatory States. Ratification of the Convention
will normally ipso facto involve ratification of the Protocol.

(b) An ancillary instrument to a Convention, but of an
independent character and operation and subject to independent
ratification, for example, the Hague Protocols of 1930 on
Statelessness, signed at the same time as the Hague Convention
of 1930 on the Conflict of Nationality Laws.

(c) An altogether independent treaty.

(d) A record of certain understandings arrived at, more
often called a Proces-Verbal.

(3) Agreement
This is an instrument less formal than a treaty or Convention
proper, and generally not in Heads of State form. It is usually
applied to agreements of more limited scope and with fewer
parties than the ordinary Convention. It is also employed
1 It is still sometimes used for a bilateral treaty; note, e.g., the Franco-Dutch
General Convention on Social Security of January, 1950.
2 Partial Agreements: The term Partial Agreement " is used for an
Agreement prepared and concluded within the framework of the Council of
Europe, but between only a limited number of interested States.

------
Chap. 15.-Practice as to Treaties
403
for agreements of a technical or administrative character only,
signed by the representatives of Government Departments, but
not subject to ratification.

(4) Arrangement
The observations above as to Agreements apply here. It is
more usually employed for a transaction of a provisional or
temporary nature.

(5) Procès-Verbal
This term originally denoted the summary of the proceedings
and conclusions of a diplomatic conference, but is now used
as well to mean the record of the terms of some agreement
reached between the parties; for example, the Procès-Verbal
signied at Zurich in 1892 by the representatives of Italy and
Switzerland to record their understanding of the provisions of
the Treaty of Commerce between them. It is also used to
record an exchange or deposit of ratifications, or for an
administrative agreement of a purely minor character, or to
effect a minor alteration to a Convention. It is generally not
subject to ratification.

(6) Statute

(a) A collection of constituent rules relating to the functioning
of an international institution, for example, the Statute of the
International Court of Justice, 1945.

(b) A collection of rules laid down by international agree-
ment as to the functioning under international supervision of
a particular entity, for example, the Statute of the Sanjak of
Alexandretta, 1937.1

(c) An accessory instrument to a Convention setting out
certain regulations to be applied; for example, the Statute on
Freedom of Transit annexed to the Convention on Freedom of
Transit, Barcelona, 1921.
1 _See_ the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice on the
Interpretation of the Statute of Memel Territory, Pub. P.C.I.J. (1932), Series
A/B, No. 49, at p. 300, which shows that this type of statute must be interpreted
in the same way as a treaty.

------
404
Part 4.- International Transactions

(7) Declaration
The term denotes :---


(a) A treaty proper, for example, the Declaration of Paris,
1856.

(b) An informal instrument appended to a treaty or Con-
vention interpreting or explaining the provisions of the latter.

(c) An informal agreement with respect to a matter of minor
importance.

(d) A resolution by a diplomatic conference, enunciating
some principle or desideratum for observance by all States; for
example, the Declaration on the Prohibition of Military,
Political or Economic Coercion in the Conclusion of Treaties,
adopted by the Vienna Conference of 1968--1969 on the Law of
Treaties.
Declarations may or may not be subject to ratification.

(8) Modus Vivendi
A modus vivendi is an instrument recording an international
agreement of a temporary or provisional nature intended to
be replaced by an arrangement of a more permanent and
detailed character. It is usually made in a most informal
way, and never requires ratification.

(9) Exchange of Notes (or of Letters)
An exchange of notes is an informal method, very frequently
adopted in recent years, whereby States subscribe to certain
understandings or recognise certain obligations as binding
them. Sometimes the exchange of notes is effected through
i In addition the term Declaration " can denote:---
-(i) A unilateral
declaration of intent by a State; e.g., a declaration accepting the compulsory
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice under Article 36, paragraph 2
of its Statute. (ii) Resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly,
intended to affirm a significant principle; e.g., Declaration on the Rights of
the Child, adopted in 1959.
2 E.g., being made in the names of the negotiating plenipotentiaries only,
or initialled without being signed.

and _cf._ Article 13 of the Vienna Convention (exchange of instruments con-
stituting a treaty-consent to be bound is expressed by such exchange), and
Satow's Guide to Diplomatic Practice (4th Edition, 1957), pp. 340--342.

the diplomatic or military representatives of the States
concerned. Ratification is not usually required.
There have been also instances of multilateral exchanges of
notes.
(10) Final Act
The Final Act is the title of the instrument which records
the winding up of the proceedings of the Conference summoned
to conclude a Convention (_see_, for example, the Final Act of
the Vienna Conference of 1968--1969 on the Law of Treaties).
It summarises the terms of reference of the Conference, and
enumerates the States or Heads of States represented, the
delegates who took part in the discussions, and the instru-
mei adopted by the Conference. It also sets out resolutions,
declarations, and recommendations adopted by the Con-
ference which were not incorporated as provisions of the
Convention. Sometimes it also contains interpretations of
provisions in the formal instruments adopted by the Con-
ference. The Final Act is signed but does not require
ratification.
There have been several instances of a Final Act which was
a real international treaty, for example, the Final Act of the
Conference of Countries Exporting and Importing Wheat,
signed at London in August, 1933.
(11) General Act
A General Act is really a treaty but may be of a formal or
informal character. The title was used by the League of
Nations in the case of the General Act for the Pacific Settle-
ment of International Disputes adopted by the Assembly in
1928, of which a revised text was adopted by the United
Nations General Assembly on April 28, 1949.1
1 Other titles for treaty instruments, sometimes used, are:---
Accord; Act
(French equivalent--Acte) for a treaty laying down general rules of inter-
national law or setting up an international organ; Aide-Mémoire; Articles, or
Articles of Agreement (e.g., Articles of Agreement of the International Mone-
tary Fund, 1944); Charter and Constitution for the constituent instruments of
international organisations; Compact, Instrument, Memorandum, Memoran-
dum of Agreement, Memorandum of Understanding, and Minute or Agreed
Minutes to record in a less formal manner some understanding or to deal
with a minor procedural matter; Note verbale; Pact, to record some solemn
obligation; and Public Act (similar to Act, above).

------
406
Part 4.- International Transactions
3.-PARTIES TO TREATIES
Generally only States which fulfil the requirements of
statehood at international law, or international organisations
can be parties to treaties.
Modern developments have made it almost impossible to
apply this rule in all its strictness. Sometimes agreements of
a technical character are made between the Government
Departments of different States, being signed by representa-
tives of these departments. Sometimes also Conventions will
extend to the colonial territories of States.
As a general rule a treaty may not impose obligations or
confer rights on third parties without their consent (Vienna
Convention, Article 34), and, indeed, many treaties expressly
declare that they are to be binding only on the parties. This
general principle, which is expressed in the Latin maxim pacta
tertiis nec nocent nec prosunt, finds support in the practice of
States, in the decisions of international tribunals, and now in
the provisions of the Vienna Convention (_see_ Articles 34--38).
The exceptions to it are as follows:---


(a) Treaties under which the intention of the parties is to
accord rights to third States, with their express or presumed
assent, such as treaties effecting an international settlement or
conferring an international status on ports, waterways, etc.,
may reach out to States non-parties. The best illustration of
this is the Convention of 1856 between France, Great Britain,
and Russia, concerning the non-fortification of the Aaland
Islands. In 1920, after Sweden, a non-party, had insisted that
the provisions of the Convention should be complied with, a
League of Nations Committee of Jurists expressed the opinion
that, though Sweden was a non-party and had no contractual
rights, the Convention in fact created objective law, with
benefits extending beyond the circle of the contracting parties.
As the Permanent Court of International Justice has pointed
out, the operation of such a third-party right is not lightly
For discussion, _see_ Ingrid Detter, Essays on the Law of Treaties (1967),
pp. 100--118; Joseph Gold, The Fund and Non-Member State. Some Legal
Effects (IMF Pamphlet Series, No. 7); and commentary on Articles 30--32,

nature of _obiter dicta_.

407
to be presumed and much depends on the circumstances of
each case.
But if the parties intended to confer rights on a
State which was not a party, this intention may be decisive.
The test is " whether the States which have stipulated in favour
of a third State meant to create an actual right which the
latter has accepted as such ".
Article 36 of the Vienna Convention purports to declare a
general principle covering the case of such treaties intended to
confer third party rights. On the matter of third party assent,
it lays down that such assent" shall be presumed so long as the
contrary is not indicated, unless the treaty otherwise provides ".
This can hardly be described as a model of vintage drafting,
while also obscurity surrounds Article 37 paragraph 2, pro-
viding that such a third party right may not be revoked or
modified by the parties "if it is established that the right was
intended not to be revocable or subject to modification without
the consent of the third State".

(b) Multilateral treaties declaratory of established customary
international law will obviously apply to non-parties, but the
true position is that non-parties are bound not by the treaty
but by the customary rules, although the precise formulation of
the rules in the treaty may be of significance. Also treaties,
bilateral or otherwise, may by constituting elements in the
formation of customary international law, come to bind third
parties by virtue of the same principle (_cf._ Vienna Convention,
Article 38).

(c) Multilateral treaties creating new rules of international
law may bind non-parties in the same way as do all rules of
international law, or be _de facto_ applied by them as standard-
setting instruments.

(d) Certain multilateral Conventions which are intended to
have universal operation, may provide in terms for their
application to non-parties. Thus, the Geneva Drugs Con-
vention of 1931 now replaced by the Single Convention on
1 _See above_, p. 45. _Cf._ the Briand-Kellogg Pact of 1928 for the Outlawry
of War which under the Nuremberg Judgment of 1946 was regarded as creating
general law for signatories and non-signatories alike.

------
408
Part 4.--International Transactions
Narcotic Drugs concluded at New York on March 30, 1961,
enabled an international organ finally to determine the estimates
for legitimate narcotic drug requirements of States, not parties
to the Convention. Moreover, if a State non-party exceeded
these estimates by obtaining or producing larger supplies of
drugs, it became liable to an embargo on imports in the same
way as States parties.

(e) Article 35 of the Vienna Convention declares that an
obligation arises for a third State from a treaty provision, if the
parties to the treaty intend the provision to be the means of
establishing the obligation, and the third State expressly
accepts the obligation in writing. It is questionable whether
this is a real exception; an arguable point is that the treaty
itself in conjunction with the written acceptance of the obliga-
tion may constitute a composite tripartite arrangement, and
such an interpretation seems to be supported by Article 37
paragraph 1, providing that the obligation may be revoked or
modified only with the consent of the treaty parties and the
third State "unless it is established that they had otherwise
agreed ".
In the light of the impact of the above-mentioned Articles
34--38 of the Vienna Convention upon the admissibility of third
party rights and obligations, the practical course for States
not wishing, in any treaty concluded by them, to confer such
rights or impose such obligations is to stipulate expressly
against this result, while a non-party State, unwilling to be
saddled with an external treaty obligation, should ensure that
neither by its conduct nor by its declarations has it assented
to the imposition of the obligation.

4.-PRACTICE AS TO CONCLUSION AND ENTRY INTO
FORCE OF TREATIES
The various steps in the creation of obligations by treaty
are:

(1) The accrediting of persons who conduct negotiations
on behalf of the contracting States.

(2) Negotiation and adoption.

(3) Authentication, signature and exchange of instruments.

(4) Ratification.

(5) Accessions and adhesions.

(6) Entry into force.

(7) Registration and publication.

(8) Application and enforcement.
We shall take each of these steps in turn.

(1) Accrediting of Negotiators ; Full Powers and Credentials
Once a State has decided to commence negotiations with
another State or other States for a particular treaty, the first
step is to appoint representatives to conduct the negotiations.
It is clearly important that each representative should be
properly accredited to the other and be equipped with the
necessary authority proving not merely his status as an official
envoy, but also his power to attend at and to participate in
the negotiations, as well as to conclude and sign the final
treaty, although, strictly speaking, a power to sign is un-
necessary for the stage of negotiations. In practice a repre-
sentative of a State is provided with a very formal instrument
given either by the Head of State or by the Minister of Foreign
Affairs showing his authority in these various regards. This
instrument is called the Full Powers or Pleins Pouvoirs.1
According to British practice, two kinds of Full Powers are
issued to plenipotentiaries:---


(a) If the treaty to be negotiated is in the Heads of State
1
_See_, as to the whole subject, Jones, Full Powers and Ratification (1946).
Full Powers can authorise the representative to negotiate, adopt, or authen-
ticate a treaty text, or to express a State's consent to be bound by a treaty,
or to accomplish any other act with respect to a treaty (Vienna Convention,
Article 2); possibly, for example, to terminate or denounce a treaty.

------
410
Part 4,- International Transactions
form, special Full Powers are prepared signed by the Sovereign
and sealed with the Great Seal.

(b) If the treaty to be negotiated is in the inter-governmental
or inter-State form, Government Full Powers are issued, signed
by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and bearing his
official seal.
Full Powers are not necessary if it appears from the practice
of the negotiating States that their intention was to consider
the person concerned as representing the sending State, and
to dispense with Full Powers (Vienna Convention, Article 7
paragraph 1 (b)). Nor are Full Powers normally issued for
the signature of an agreement to be concluded between the
departments of two Governments. This is rather a manifesta-
tion of the principle that the negotiating States concerned may
evince an intention to dispense with Full Powers.
When bilateral treaties are concluded, each representative
exhibits his Full Powers to the other. Sometimes an actual
exchange of these documents is effected, in other cases only
an exchange of certified copies takes place. Practice in this
matter is far from settled.
In the case of diplomatic Conferences summoned to conclude
a multilateral instrument, a different procedure is followed.
At the beginning of the proceedings a Committee of Full
Powers is appointed to report generally to the Conference on
the nature of the Full Powers which each representative at the
Conference possesses.1 The delegates hand in their Full
Powers to the Secretary of the Committee of Full Powers.
It may be, for instance, that Full Powers possessed by a
particular delegate authorise him to negotiate but give him
no power to sign. In that case the Committee reports the
fact to the Conference and the delegate is specifically requested
to obtain from his Government the necessary authority to
sign. In practice, Committees of Full Powers do not, as a
rule, insist on the presentation of formal instruments of Full
1 Under Article 7 paragraph 2 (c) of the Vienna Convention, representatives
accredited to an international conference, or to an international organisation
or one of its organs, for the purpose of adopting a treaty text in that con-
ference, organisation, or organ, are considered as representing their sending
State, without the necessity of producing Full Powers.

Powers, but sometimes temporarily accept as credentials far
less formal documents such as telegrams or letters emanating
from Prime Ministers, Ministers for Foreign Affairs, or Per-
manent Delegates to the United Nations.
In the case of the International Labour Conference, Full
Powers are generally not given to the various Government,
employers' and workers' delegates of each State represented.
As a rule credentials are issued by the Government authorising
delegates to the Conference merely to attend it, but of course
giving them no power to agree to or to conclude or to sign
Conventions adopted by the Conference, since these Con-
ventions are not signed by delegates but merely authenticated
by the signatures of the President of the Conference and the
Director-General of the International Labour Office, and
since the Conference adopts a text in a different manner from
diplomatic Conferences.
Acts relating to the conclusion of a treaty performed by a
person who has either not produced appropriate Full Powers
or who, in the absence of Full Powers, has not been considered
as representing his sending State, are without legal effect
unless subsequently confirmed by that State (Vienna Con-
vention, Article 8).

(2) Negotiation and Adoption
Negotiations concerning a treaty are conducted either
through Pourparlers in the case of bilateral treaties or by a
diplomatic Conference, the more usual procedure when a
multilateral treaty is to be adopted. In both cases the delegates
remain in touch with their Governments, they have with them
preliminary instructions which are not communicated to the
other parties, and at any stage they may consult their Govern-
ments and, if necessary, obtain fresh instructions. As a
1
Heads of State, Heads of Government, and Ministers for Foreign Affairs,
negotiating in person, do not need Full Powers, but are treated as representing
their State for the purpose of performing all acts relating to the conclusion of
a treaty, and the same applies to the head of a diplomatic mission for the
purpose of adopting a treaty between the sending and the receiving State
(Vienna Convention, Article 7, paragraph 2 (a) and (b).

------
412
Part 4.- International Transactions
matter of general practice, before appending their signature to
the final text of the treaty, delegates do obtain fresh instructions
to sign the instrument whether with or without reservations.
The procedure at diplomatic Conferences runs to a standard
pattern. Apart from Steering Committees, Legal and Draft-
ing Committees are appointed at an early stage to receive and
review the draft provisions proposed by the various delegations.
Usually, too, the Conference appoints a prominent delegate to
act as rapporteur in order to assist the Conference in its
deliberations. Besides the formal public sessions of the Con-
ference, many parleys are conducted in the "corridors", in
hotel rooms, and at special dinners and functions. The results
of these appear in due course in the decisions reached by the
Conference.
Article 9 paragraph 2 of the Vienna Convention provides
that the adoption of a treaty text at an international con-
ference is to take place by the vote of two-thirds of the States
present and voting, unless by the same majority these States
decide to apply a different rule.
It should be mentioned that in respect of certain subjects
at least, the procedure of adoption of multilateral instruments
by diplomatic Conferences has been replaced by the method
of their adoption by the organs of international institutions;
for example, by-among others---the United Nations General
Assembly, the World Health Assembly, and the Assembly of
the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The Conven-
tions adopted by any such Assembly are opened for signature
or acceptance by Member or non-Member States.
A novel procedure was adopted in regard to the Convention
of March 18, 1965, for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States. The Executive
Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (World Bank) prepared the final text with the
preliminary assistance of a Legal Committee representing
61 member Governments of the Bank, and submitted it to
Governments for signature, subject to ratification, acceptance
or approval.

(3) Authentication, Signature and Exchange of Instruments
When the final draft of the treaty has been agreed upon,
the instrument is ready for signature. The text may be made
public for a certain period before signature, as in the case of
the North Atlantic Security Treaty, made public on March 18,
1949, and signed at Washington on April 4, 1949. The act of
signature is usually a most formal matter, even in the case of
bilateral treaties. As to multilateral Conventions, signature is
generally effected at a formal closing session (séance de clôture)
in the course of which each delegate steps up to a table and
signs on behalf of the Head of State or Government by whom
he was appointed.
Unless there is an agreement to dispense with signature,
this is essential for a treaty, principally because it serves to
authenticate the text. The rule, as stated in Article 10 of the
Vienna Convention, is that the text may be authenticated by
such procedure as is laid down in the treaty itself, or as is
agreed to by the negotiating States, or in the absence of such
agreed procedure, by signature, signature ad referendum (as
to which, _see_ p. 415, post), initialling, or by incorporation in
the Final Act? of the conference. In practice, also, the text
of an instrument may be authenticated by the resolution of an
international organisation. If a treaty is signed, it is important
that the signature should be made by each of the delegates at
the same time and place, and in the presence of each other.
Furthermore, the date of the treaty is usually taken to be the
date on which it was signed.
Sometimes not merely a delegate but a Head of State will
sign a treaty. Thus, in 1919, Woodrow Wilson, as President
of the United States, signed the Treaty of Versailles, the
1 In which case, formal signature of an instrument in proper form, takes
place later; e.g., the Security Treaty between Australia, New Zealand, and
the United States (ANZUS), initialled at Washington on July 12, 1951, and
signed at San Francisco on September 1, 1951. Other cases of initialling
occur where a representative, without authority to sign or acting generally
without instructions, prefers not to sign a text. In special circumstances, an
initialling may be intended to operate as a signature; and _cf._ Vienna Con-
vention, Article 12.
2 _See_ p. 405, _ante_.

Part 4.- International Transactions
وو
preamble reciting that he acted " in his own name and by his
own proper authority".
As mentioned above, the Conventions adopted by the
International Labour Conference are not signed by the
delegates but are simply authenticated by the signatures of
the President of the Conference and the Director-General of
the International Labour Office. There have also been cases
of instruments adopted by international organs, which are
accepted or acceded to by States, without signature.
It is a common practice to open a Convention for signature
by certain States until a certain date after the date of the
formal session of signature. Generally, this period does not
exceed nine months. The object is to obtain as many parties
to the Convention as possible, but inasmuch as new signatories
can only be allowed with the consent of the original signatories,
a special clause to this effect must be inserted in the Convention.
A current practice is to open a Convention for signature to all
members of the United Nations and the specialised agencies, to
all parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice,
and to any other State invited by the General Assembly.
During the period mentioned, each State may sign at any time,
but after the expiration of the period no further signatures
are allowed and a non-signatory State desiring to become a
party must accede or adhere to the Convention but cannot
ratify, inasmuch as it has not signed the instrument. In the
case of the nuclear weapons test ban treaty of 1963 referred to
_ante_, the instrument was opened for the signature of all States
(_see_ Article III).
A further expedient has been, by the so-called acceptance
formula clause, to open an instrument for an indefinite time
for:---

(a) signature, without reservation as to acceptance;

(b) signature subject to, and followed by later acceptance; and

(c) acceptance simpliciter, leaving States free to become
bound by any one of these three methods. The term accep-
tance", used in this clause, has crept into recent treaty ter-
minology to denote the act of becoming a party to a treaty by
1 _See_ p. 191.

------
Chap. 15.--Practice as to Treaties
415
adherence of any kind, in accordance with a State's municipal
constitutional law.1 The principal object of the clause was
indeed to meet difficulties which might confront a potential
State party under its municipal constitutional rules relative to
treaty approval. Some States did not wish to use the term
" ratification ", as this might imply an obligation to submit a
treaty to the Legislature for approval, or to go through some
undesired constitutional procedure.
Effect of Signature
The effect of signature of a treaty depends on whether or
not the treaty is subject to ratification, acceptance, or approval.
If the treaty is subject to ratification, acceptance, or approval,
signature means no more than that the delegates have agreed
upon a text and are willing to accept it and refer it to their
Governments for such action as those Governments may choose
to take in regard to the acceptance or rejection of the treaty.
It may also indicate an intention on the part of a Government
to make a fresh examination of the question dealt with by the
treaty with a view to putting the treaty into force. In the
absence of an express term to that effect, there is no binding
obligation on a signatory State to submit the treaty to the
national legislature for action or otherwise. On the other
hand, it is laid down in the Vienna Convention that, where a
treaty is subject to ratification, acceptance, or approval,
signatory States are under an obligation of good faith to refrain
from acts calculated to defeat the object of the treaty until
2
1 On the meaning of " acceptance ", _see_ Yuen-Li Liang, Anierican Journal
of International Law (1950), Vol. 44, pp. 342 _et seq._ It means in effect a
decision to become definitively bound, in accordance with a State's municipal
constitutional rules. As to the term approval ", _see_ commentary on
Article 11, Draft Arts. I.L.C.
The common practice of signature ad referendum generally denotes that
the signatory State is unable at the time to accept definitively the negotiated
terms expressed in the treaty. It has also been interpreted as indicating that
the plenipotentiary concerned had no definite instructions to sign, and no time
to consult his Government. If signature ad referendum be confirmed by the
State concerned, the result is a full signature of the treaty; _cf._ Vienna Con-
vention, Article 12.

------
416
Part 4.--International Transactions
they have made their intention clear of not becoming parties
(_see_ Article 181).
Where a treaty is subject to ratification, acceptance, or
approval, it is sometimes expressly stipulated in the treaty or
in some related exchange of notes that, pending ratification,
acceptance, or approval, the instrument is to operate on a
provisional basis as from the date of signature, as with the
Japan-Australia Trade Treaty of July 6, 1957.
If the treaty is not subject to ratification, acceptance, or
approval, or is silent on this point, the better opinion is that, in
the absence of contrary provision, the instrument is binding as
from signature. The ground for this opinion is that it has
become an almost invariable practice where a treaty is to be
ratified, accepted, or approved, to insert a clause making
provision to this effect, and where such provision is absent, the
treaty may be presumed to operate on signature. Some
treaties may by their express provisions operate from the date
of signature, for example, the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of
Alliance of 1902, and Agreements concluded within the frame-
work of the Council of Europe, which are expressed to be
signed without reservation in respect to ratification. Also many
treaties relating to minor or technical matters, generally bearing
the titles " Agreement ", " Arrangement "or" Procès-Verbal",
are simply signed but not ratified, and operate as from the
date signature is appended. Indeed if there is direct evidence
of intention to be bound by signature alone, as e.g. in the terms
of the Full Powers, this is sufficient to bind the States con-
cerned without more. Article 12 of the Vienna Convention
upholds the autonomous right of the negotiating States so to
agree, expressly or impliedly, that they shall be bound by
signature alone, or by initialling treated as equivalent to signa-
ture, or by signature ad referendum (_see_ pp. 415, n. 2, _ante_)
confirmed by the sending State.
وو
1 Under this article, also, a State which has expressed a consent to be bound
by a treaty, is similarly obliged to refrain from such acts, pending the entry
into force of the treaty, and provided that such entry into force is not unduly
delayed.

------
Chap. 15.- Practice as to Treaties
417
Exchange of Instruments
Where a treaty is constituted by instruments exchanged by
representatives of the parties, such exchange may result in the
parties becoming bound by the treaty if:---

(a) the instruments
provide that the exchange is to have this effect; or (b) it can
otherwise be shown that the parties were agreed that this would
be the effect of such exchange (Vienna Convention, Article 13).
Sealing
Treaties and Conventions are nearly always sealed, although
this is not the case with the less formal types of international
agreements. Sealing appears now to have lost its prior
importance, and is not necessary either for the authentication
or the validity of the treaty. Formerly, with the exception of
notarial attestation for special instruments, it was however
the only recognised mode of authenticating the text of a treaty.

(4) Ratification
The next stage is that the delegates who signed the treaty
or Convention refer it back to their Governments for approval,
if such further act of confirmation be expressly or impliedly
necessary.
In theory, ratification is the approval by the Head of State
or the Government of the signature appended to the treaty
by the duly appointed plenipotentiaries. In modern practice,
however, it has come to possess more significance than a
simple act of confirmation, being deemed to represent the
formal declaration by a State of its consent to be bound by a
treaty. So in Article 2 of the Vienna Convention, ratification
was defined to mean the international act ... whereby a
State establishes on the international plane its consent to be
bound by a treaty". Consistently with this, ratification is not
held to have retroactive effect, so as to make the treaty
obligatory from the date of signature.
At one time, ratification was regarded as so necessary that
without it a treaty should be deemed ineffective. This point
was referred to by Lord Stowell.1
66
1 _See_ The Eliza Ann (1813), 1 Dods. 244, at p. 248.

------
418
Part 4.-International Transactions
According to the practice now prevailing, a subsequent
ratification is essentially necessary; and a strong confirmation
of the truth of this position is that there is hardly a modern
treaty in which it is not expressly so stipulated; and therefore
it is now to be presumed that the powers of plenipotentiaries
are limited by the condition of a subsequent ratification. The
ratification may be a form, but it is an essential form; for the
instrument, in point of legal efficacy, is imperfect without it".
According to Judge J. B. Moore in the Mavrommatis Palestine
Concessions Casel the doctrine that treaties may be regarded
as operative before they have been ratified is "obsolete, and
lingers only as an echo from the past ".2
These judicial observations apply with less force and cogency
at the present time, when more than two-thirds of currently
registered treaties make no provision whatever for ratification,
and when most treaties make it quite clear whether or not
signature, or signature subject to ratification, acceptance, etc.
is the method chosen by the States concerned. The more
acceptable view today is that it is purely a matter of the inten-
tion of the parties whether a treaty does or does not require
ratification as a condition of its binding operation. Con-
sistently, Article 14 of the Vienna Convention provides that the
consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is expressed by
ratification if:---
-(a) the treaty so expressly provides; or

(b) the negotiating States otherwise agree that ratification is
necessary; or (c) the treaty has been signed subject to ratifica-
tion; or (d) an intention to sign subject to ratification appears
from the Full Powers or was expressed during negotiations.
The practice of ratification rests on the following rational
grounds:---


(a) States are entitled to have an opportunity of re-examining
and reviewing instruments signed by their delegates before
undertaking the obligations therein specified.
1 Pub. P.C.I.J. (1924), Series A, No. 2, at p. 57.
? In modern practice, the express or implied waiver of ratification is so
comnion that, today, the more tenable view is that ratification is not required
unless expressly stipulated. Ratification is, of course, unnecessary if the
treaty provides that parties may be bound by signature only, or if the treaty be
signed by Heads of State in person.

------
Chap. 15.--Practice as to Treaties
419

(b) By reason of its sovereignty, a State is entitled to with-
draw from participation in any treaty should it so desire.

(c) Often a treaty calls for amendments or adjustments in
municipal law. The period between signature and ratification
enables States to pass the necessary legislation or obtain the
necessary parliamentary approvals, so that they may thereupon
proceed to ratification. This consideration is important in
the case of Federal States, where, if legislation to carry into
effect treaty provisions falls within the powers of the member
units of the Federation, these may have to be consulted by the
central Government before it can ratify.

(d) There is also the democratic principle that the Govern-
ment should consult public opinion either in Parliament or
elsewhere as to whether a particular treaty should be confirmed.
Ratification and Municipal Constitutional Law
The development of constitutional systems of government
under which various organs other than the Head of State are
given a share in the treaty-making power has increased the
importance of ratification. At the same time in each country
the procedure followed in this regard differs. For instance,
often States will insist on parliamentary approval or confirma-
tion of a treaty although the treaty expressly provides that it
operates as from signature, whereas other States follow the
provisions of the treaty and regard it as binding them without
further steps being taken.
In British practice there is no rule of law requiring all treaties
to be approved by Parliament prior to ratification. It is
customary to submit certain treaties to Parliament for
approval,a for example, treaties of alliance, and ratification is
only effected after this approval is given. Theoretically, how-
ever, the Crown is constitutionally free to ratify any treaty
without the consent of Parliament. By reason of their subject-
matter some treaties necessitate the intervention of Parliament,
_See_ as to the subject of ratification, Jones, Full Powers and Ratification
(1946), and Oppenheim, International Law, Vol. I (8th Edition, 1955),
pp. 903--918.

or

for example, treaties derogating from the private rights of
citizens, treaties imposing a charge on public funds, etc. In
practice the text of every treaty subject to ratification is, as
soon as possible after signature, laid before Parliament for a
period of at least twenty-one days before ratification.i
Usually the ratification is an act executed only by the Head
of State, but in the case of treaties of lesser importance the
Government itself or the Minister for Foreign Affairs may
effect the ratification. The document of ratification is generally
a highly formal instrument, notwithstanding that international
law neither prescribes nor insists on any degree of formality
for such instruments.
Some treaties make signature subject to acceptance
approval"; these terms may then denote a simplified form
of ratification. In fact, in Article 2 of the Vienna Convention,
acceptance and approval " have received the same
definition as ratification, while the provisions of Article 14 as
to when ratification imports consent to be bound by a treaty
apply mutatis mutandis to acceptance and approval.
Absence of Duty to Ratify
The power of refusing ratification is deemed to be inherent
in State sovereignty, and accordingly at international law there
is neither a legal nor a moral duty to ratify a treaty. Further-
more, there is no obligation other than one of ordinary courtesy
to convey to other States concerned a statement of the reasons
for refusing to ratify.
In the case of multilateral " law-making" treaties, including
the Conventions of the International Labour Organisation,
the delays of States in ratifying or their unexpected withholding
of ratifications have caused much concern and raised serious
problems. The practical value of unratified Conventions
scarcely calls for comment. The principal causes of delay
were acutely investigated and reported on by a Committee
appointed by the League of Nations to consider the matter. 3
1 _See_ p. 89, n. 2, _ante_.
2 _See above_, pp. 414--416.
3 _See_ Report of the Committee, League of Nations Doc. A.10, 1930, V.

------
Chap. 15.---Practice as to Treaties
421
To borrow from the study made by this Committee the causes
may be briefly summarised as:---

(a) the complicated machinery
of modern government involving protracted administrative
work before the decision to ratify or accede; (b) the absence
of thorough preparatory work for treaties leading to defects
which entitle States to withhold or delay ratification; (c) the
shortage of parliamentary time in countries where constitutional
practice requires submission of the instrument to the Legis-
lature; (d) serious difficulties disclosed by the instrument only
after signature and calling for prolonged examination; (e) the
necessity for new national legislation or the need for increased
expenditure as a result; (f) lack of interest by States. The
International Labour Office has over a period of years developed
a specialised technique for supervising the ratification of
Conventions and their application by municipal law, partly
through a special Committeel which regularly deals with the
matter, partly through the work of special sections of the
Office. The delays in ratification may explain the recent
tendency in treaty practice to dispense with any such require-
ment.
Exchange or Deposit of Ratifications
Unless the treaty itself otherwise provides, an instrument of
ratification has no effect in finally establishing consent to be
bound by the treaty until the exchange or deposit, as the case
may be, of ratifications, or at least until some notice of ratifica-
tion is given to the other State or States concerned, or to the
depositary of the treaty, if so agreed (_see_ Vienna Convention,
Article 16). The same rule applies to an instrument of accep-
tance or approval.
In the case of bilateral treaties, ratifications are exchanged
by the States parties concerned and each instrument is filed
in the archives of the Treaty Department of each State's
Foreign Office. Usually a procès-verbal is drawn up to record
and certify the exchange.
1 The Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions.
S.I.L.-15

------
422
Part 4.- International Transactions
The method of exchange is not appropriate for the ratification
of multilateral treaties. Such a treaty usually provides for
the deposit of all ratifications in a central headquarters such
as the Foreign Office of the State where the treaty was signed.
Before the Second World War, ratifications of Conventions
adopted under the auspices of the League of Nations were
deposited in the League Secretariat, and the Secretary-General
used to notify all States concerned of the receipt of ratifications.
The Secretariat of the United Nations now carries out these
Chancery functions. In the case of the nuclear weapons test
ban treaty of 1963 referred to _ante_,2 the treaty was to be
deposited in the archives of each of the three original signa-
tories, the U.S.S.R., the U.S.A., and the U.K.

(5) Accessions and Adhesions
In practice, when a State has not signed a treaty it can only
accede or adhere to it. According to present practice, a non-
signatory State may accede or adhere even before the treaty
enters into force.3 Some writers profess to make a distinction
between accession and adhesion. Thus it is sometimes said
that accession involves being party to the whole treaty by full
and entire acceptance of all its provisions precluding reserva-
tions to any clause, whereas adhesion may be an acceptance
of part only of the treaty. Again, it is maintained by some that
accession involves participation in the treaty with the same
status as the original signatories, whereas adhesion connotes
merely approval of the principles of the treaty. These sug-
gested distinctions are not generally supported by the practice
of States.
The term " accession" has also been applied to acceptance
by a State of a treaty or Convention after the prescribed
number of ratifications for its entry into force have been
* As at the end of 1968, the Secretary-General was exercising depositary
  functions in respect of 184 treaties (Year Book of the United Nations, 1968,
  p. 851). For his practice as depositary, _see_ Summary of the Practice of the
  Secretary-General as Depositary of Multilateral Agreements. The Vienna
  Convention contains provisions setting out the functions of a depositary of a
  treaty (_see_ Articles 76--80).
  ? _See_ p. 191.
  : _See_ commentary on Article 12, Draft Arts. I.L.C.

------
Chap. 15.-Practice as to Treaties
423
deposited. Thus, assuming ten ratifications are necessary for
entry into force, and ten have been deposited, subsequent
ratifications or acceptances would be termed "accessions".
The use of the term " accession " in this sense is not generally
approved. In fact, in Article 2 of the Vienna Convention,
"accession" has received the same definition as " ratification"
while under Article 15 accession imports consent to be bound
by a treaty in the same way mutatis mutandis as under Article 14
dealing with ratification (_see_ p. 418, _ante_). Similarly, also
unless the treaty otherwise provides, an instrument of accession
does not finally establish such consent, until exchange or
deposit, or notice thereof to the contracting States, or to the
depositary, if so agreed (Vienna Convention, Article 16).
No precise form is prescribed by international law for an
instrument of accession, although generally it is in the same
form as an instrument of ratification. A simple notification
of intention to participate in a treaty may be sufficient.
Strictly speaking, States which have not signed a treaty can
in theory accede only with the consent of all the States which
are already parties to the instrument. The ratio of this rule
is that the States parties are entitled to know and approve of
all other parties to a treaty binding them, so that the equilibrium
of rights and obligations created by the treaty is not disturbed.
Usually, therefore, States accede to a treaty in virtue of a
special accession clause, enabling them to accede after the
final date for signature of the treaty, and prescribing the pro-
cedure for deposit of accessions.

(6) Entry into Force
The entry into force of a treaty depends upon its provisions,
or upon what the contracting States have otherwise agreed
(Vienna Convention, Article 24 paragraph 1). As already
mentioned, many treaties become operative on the date of
their signature, but where ratification, acceptance, or approval
is necessary, the general rule of international law is that the
treaty concerned comes into force only after the exchange or

------
424
Part 4.- International Transactions
deposit of ratifications, acceptances, or approvals by all the
States signatories. Multilateral treaties now usually make
entry into force dependent on the deposit of a prescribed
number of ratifications and like consents to be bound-usually
from six to about twenty. Sometimes, however, a precise
date for entry into force is fixed without regard to the number
of ratifications received. Sometimes, also, the treaty is to come
into operation only on the happening of a certain event; for
example, even after its ratification by all States signatories, the
Locarno Treaty of Mutual Guarantee of 1925 was to enter into
force only after Germany's admission to the League of Nations
(_see_ Article 10).
As to States parties desiring to ratify, accept, approve, or
accede, it is usually provided that the treaty or Convention
will enter into force for each such State on the date of deposit
of the appropriate instrument of consent to be bound, or
within a fixed time---usually ninety days--after such deposit.2
Sometimes also it is specified that the treaty will not be opera-
tive for a particular State until after the necessary legislation
has been passed by it.
Another frequently adopted expedient is that of the pro-
visional or _de facto_ application of a treaty, pending its _de jure_
entry into force, as for example in the case of the Protocol of
February 8, 1965, adding a new Part IV to the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of October 30, 1947.
This method of provisional application is recognised by the
Vienna Convention (_see_ Article 25).

(7) Registration and Publication
The United Nations Charter, 1945, provides by Article 102
that all treaties and international agreements entered into by
* In the case of the Genocide Convention adopted by the United Nations
  General Assembly in 1948, the prescribed number was twenty. In the
  absence of such a prescribed number of consents to be bound, a treaty enters
  into force only when all negotiating States are shown to have consented to
  be bound (Vienna Convention, Article 24, paragraph 2).
  2 In principle, the act of deposit is sufficient without notification to other
  States concerned; _cf._ commentary on Article 13, Draft Arts. I.L.C.

------
Chap. 15.---Practice as to Treaties
425
Members of the United Nations Organisation shall " as soon
as possible " be registered with the Secretariat of the Organisa-
tion and be published by it. No party to a treaty or agreement
not registered in this way" may invoke that treaty or agreement
before any organ of the United Nations". This means that
a State party to such an unregistered treaty or agreement
cannot rely upon it in proceedings before the International
Court of Justice or in meetings of the General Assembly or
Security Council. Apparently the provision does not invalidate
an unregistered treaty, or prevent such a treaty from being
invoked before bodies or Courts other than United Nations
organs.
The object of Article 102 was to prevent the practice of secret
agreements between States, and to make it possible for the
people of democratic States to repudiate such treaties when
publicly disclosed.
It has been suggested that Article 102 gives Member States
a discretion in deciding whether or not to register treaties,
and, by electing not to register, voluntarily to incur the penalty
of unenforceability of the instrument, but the better view,
adopted by the Sixth Committee (Legal) of the United Nations
General Assembly in 1947, is that it imposes a binding
obligation to effect registration.
The following points may be briefly referred to:---

(a) In the
interim period pending registration "as soon as possible",
the unregistered treaty can be relied upon before the Court or
any United Nations organ, subject presumably to an under-
taking to register. (b) Notwithstanding a failure to register
"as soon as possible", the lapse can be cured by subsequent
registration. (c) Although, in principle, the functions of the
Secretariat are purely ministerial, and it cannot reject an illegal
treaty for registration, _semble_, an instrument obviously on the
face of it, neither a treaty nor an international agreement,
ought to be refused registration. (d) Under a direction from
the General Assembly, the Secretariat receives for filing and
recording (as distinct from registration and publication),
instruments entered into before the date of coming into force
of the Charter, and instruments transmitted by non-Member

------
426
Part 4.--International Transactions
States, but in substance this process amounts to voluntary
registration. (e) Certified statements as to changes in the
parties, or the terms, scope, and application of registered
treaties, are also received for registration.1
The duty of publication by the Secretariat is performed by
publishing the instruments concerned in the United Nations
Treaty Series (_cf._ the former League of Nations Treaty Series),
together with lists from time to time of ratifications,
acceptances, etc. A failure to publish does not render the
instrument unenforceable (_see_ terms of Article 102).
Instruments that have been lodged with the Secretariat,
include treaties or agreements made by or with the specialised
agencies of the United Nations, trusteeship agreements,
declarations accepting compulsory jurisdiction of the Inter-
national Court of Justice, and even unilateral engagements of
an international character, such as the Egyptian Declaration of
April 24, 1957, regarding the future use of the Suez Canal.
Certain international organisations other than the United
Nations have their own system of registration, etc., for treaties
related to such organisations.

(8) Application and Enforcement
The final stage of the treaty-making process is the actual
incorporation, where necessary, of the treaty provisions in the
municipal law of the States parties, and the application by such
States of these provisions, and, also, any required administra-
tion and supervision by international organs. In practice,
vigilant " follow-up" work is needed to ensure that States
parties do actually apply instruments binding them. Some
international organs (for example, the International Labour
Organisation with its Committee of Experts on the Application
1 _See_ the Regulations adopted by the General Assembly on December 14,
1946, as amended on December 12, 1950; these Regulations enable a certificate
of registration of a treaty to be issued, and also permit the filing and recording
(as distinct from registration) of agreements entered into by the United
Nations and its specialised agencies (for text, _see_ Report of the International
Law Commission, for 1962, Annex, pp. 37--38). Article 80 of the Vienna
Convention provides that treaties shall, after their entry into force, be trans-
mitted to the Secretariat of the United Nations for registration or filing and
recording, as the case may be, and for publication.

published officially.

of Conventions and Recommendations, and its tripartite
Conference Committee on the application of these instruments)
have special Committees to discharge this function, work which
may be supplemented by the sending of official visiting missions.
One innovation has been the drawing up of special model codes
for the legislative application of Conventions.
Structure of Conventions and Treaties
The principal parts of Conventions or treaties in their usual
order are:---


(1) The preamble or preliminary recitals, setting out the
names of the parties (Heads of State, States, or Governments),
the purpose for which the instrument was concluded, the
"resolve " of the parties to enter into it, and the names and
designations of the plenipotentiaries.

(2) The substantive clauses, sometimes known as the
dispositive provisions".

(3) The formal (or final) clauses or "clauses protocolaires "j
dealing with technical or formal points or matters relative to
the application or entry into force of the instrument. The
usual such clauses relate separately to the following:---


(i) The
date of the instrument. (ii) The mode of acceptance (signature,
accession, etc.). (iii) Opening of the instrument for signature.

(iv) Entry into force. (v) Duration. (vi) Denunciation by the
parties. (vii) Application by municipal legislation. (viii) Appli-
cation to territories, etc.? (ix) Languages in which the instru-
ment is drafted. (x) Settlement of disputes. (xi) Amend-
ment or revision. (xii) Registration. (xiii) Custody of the
original instrument.

(4) Formal attestation or acknowledgment of signature, and
of the date and place of signature.

(5) Signature by the plenipotentiaries.

Nations Secretariat, August, 1951, and the document on standard final clauses,
A/CONF.39/L. 1, prepared for the Vienna Conference of 1968--1969 on the
Law of Treaties. In 1962, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of
Europe adopted texts of model final clauses of Agreements and Conventions.
For the British practice regarding this so-called " Territories
Clause,
_see_ the United Nations publication, Laws and Practices Concerning the Con-
clusion of Treaties (1953), at pp. 122--124. In the light of the subject matter
and purpose of a treaty, a Territories Clause may be dispensed with; _see_ e.g.,
the Convention of 1962 on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage,
and Registration of Marriages.

5. ---RESERVATIONS
   A State may often wish to sign or ratify or otherwise consent
   to be bound by a treaty in such manner that certain provisions
   of the treaty do not bind it, or apply to it subject to modifica-
   tions. This can be effected principally by:---

(1) express
   provision in the treaty itself; or (2) by agreement between the
   contracting States; or (3) by a reservation duly made.
   Where a State wishes to become bound by a specific part
   only of a treaty, its consent to be so bound can be effective
   only if this is permitted by the treaty or is otherwise agreed to
   by the contracting States; and where a treaty allows a con-
   tracting State to become partially bound by exercising a choice
   between differing provisions, the consent must make clear to
   which provisions it relates (Vienna Convention, Article 17).
   A reservation is defined in Article 2 of the Vienna Convention
   as a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a
   State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving, or acceding
   to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or modify the legal
   effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to
   that State. For example, a reservation may stipulate for
   exemption from one or more provisions of the treaty, or the
   modification of these provisions or of their effect, or the inter-
   pretation of the provisions in a particular way. A declaration
   by a signatory as to how the treaty will be applied, which does
   not vary the obligations of that signatory vis-à-vis other
   signatories, is not however a true reservation.2
   _See_ commentary on Articles 16--20, Draft Arts. I.L.C. for the 1966 views
   of the International Law Commission upon the subject.
   2 _See_ Power Authority of State of New York v. Federal Power Commission
   (1957), 247 F.(2d) 538. In 1959, the Assembly of the Inter-Governmental
   Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO) agreed that India's acceptance
   of the Convention of March 6, 1948, establishing the Organisation, subject to
   her right to adopt measures aimed solely at developing her maritime in-
   dustries, was not a reservation but a declaration of policy. A similar problem
   arose in IMCO concerning Cuba's declaration in 1964 and 1965 in connection
   with Cuba's acceptance of the same Convention, that it would not consider
   itself bound by the Convention if IMCO made recommendations at variance
   with Cuban domestic law. There was a division of opinion among IMCO
   members whether the Cuban declaration was a statement of policy, or an
   impermissible reservation.

Chap. 15.--Practice as to Treaties
429
Like the power of withholding ratification, the privilege of
making reservations is regarded as an incident of the sovereignty
and perfect equality of States. It is felt preferable that States
which cannot accept certain provisions should participate in
the treaty, even if only in a limited way, rather than that they
should be excluded altogether from participation. Where
there is agreement on the basic provisions of a Convention, a
certain diversity of obligation in respect of the less important
provisions is regarded, subject to some limits, as permissible.
The effect of a reservation is to modify the provisions of the
treaty to which the reservation relates, to the extent of that
reservation, in the reserving State's relations with other parties,
but leaving intact the treaty relations of non-reserving States
_inter se_. This applies
This applies also to relations between a reserving
State and a State objecting to the reservation, provided it has
not opposed the entry into force of the treaty between it and the
reserving State (Vienna Convention, Article 21).
In principle, a State making a reservation can do so only
with the consent of other contracting States; otherwise the
whole object of the treaty might be impaired. Sometimes,
the intention to make reservations is announced at some
session or other of the Conference and the reservations are
then and there agreed to by the delegates, but in principle such
an embryo" reservation should be confirmed in the sub-
sequent signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or acces-
sion, or at least in the formal minutes of the proceedings. If
a State wishes to ratify or otherwise consent to be bound,
subject to a reservation, it should inquire of the other States
parties whether they assent to the reservation; and in certain
circumstances the assent may be inferred. The practice of
making reservations has, however, become so common that
States have tended to ignore the requirement of obtaining the
assent of other States parties; thus reservations have frequently
66
1 _Cf._ Vienna Convention, Article 23, paragraph 2.
2 For the purposes of Article 20 of the Vienna Conventi a contracting
State is deemed to have accepted a reservation, if it has raised no objection
within 12 months of notification, or by the date of its expression of consent to
be bound by the treaty, whichever is later (_see_ Article 20, paragraph 5).

430
Part 4.--International Transactions
been made at the time of signature without being announced
during the deliberations of the Conference, or at the time or
ratification or accession without previous consultation of
inquiry of States which have signed or ratified the treaty.
The form in which reservations have been recorded has
varied; sometimes they are inserted in a Protocol of Signature
annexed to the Convention concerned, sometimes in the Final
Act, sometimes they are specified in an exchange of notes,
sometimes they are made by transcription under or above the
signature for the State making them, and sometimes merely
by declaration at the Conference recorded in the minutes (or
procès-verbal) of the proceedings.
The Vienna Convention (_see_ Article 23) laid it down that
reservations, and acceptance of, or objections to reservations,
must be in writing and be duly communicated; also reserva-
tions made when signing a treaty subject to ratification,
acceptance, or approval, must be confirmed in the subsequent
instrument of ratification, acceptance, or approval.
Because of the special character of the Conventions of the
International Labour Organisation, it is recognised that these
instruments are incapable of being ratified subject to reserva-
tions. They may, however, in certain circumstances be con-
ditionally ratified. 1
It is generally accepted that reservations expressly or im-
pliedly prohibited by the terms of a treaty are inadmissible,
while those expressly or impliedly authorised, are effective.
The Vienna Convention provides that a reservation "expressly"
authorised by a treaty does not require subsequent assent by
other contracting States, unless the treaty so provides (Article 20,
paragraph 1).
With the increase in the number of multilateral Conventions
the unchecked practice of making reservations to multilateral
instruments has created a disturbing problem. Obviously an
1 Also, a State ratifying a Labour Convention may couple its ratification
with explanations of any limitations upon the manner in which it intends to
execute the Convention; and the provisions in the Convention may be drawn
so as to allow certain States some latitude in fulfilling their obligations; _see_
International Labour Code, 1951, Vol. I (1952), pp. xcix-ci and Coventions and
Recommendations Adopted by the I.L. Conference 1919--1966 (1966), p. VIII.
2 E.g., if the treaty authorises specified reservations which do not include
the reservation in question.

Chap. 15.---Practice as to Treaties
431
excessive number of reservations tends to throw out of gear
the operation of a multilateral treaty. Also, States are never
sure that later, when ratifying, another State may not make a
reservation which originally would have deterred them from
entering into the treaty. Various solutions of the difficulty
have been adopted from time to time, in order to secure a
maximum number of parties to multilateral Conventions.
According to the solution resorted to by the Inter-American
States, a signatory desiring to make reservations is not pre-
cluded from becoming a party to the Convention, but the
Convention is deemed not to be in force between such "resery-
ing" State and any State objecting to the reservations.
If a limited number of negotiating States be involved, and
it is clear from the object and purpose of the treaty that the
application of the treaty in its entirety is an essential condition
of the consent of each State to be bound by the treaty, the
admissibility of the reservations will depend upon unanimous
acceptance (Vienna Convention, Article 20, paragraph 2).
Also, if the reservation is one to the constituent instrument
of an international organisation, _prima facie_, acceptance by a
competent organ of that institution is required, unless there is
express provision to the contrary (Vienna Convention, Article
20, paragraph 3).
Where these rules do not apply, a reserving State may become
party to the treaty vis-à-vis a State accepting the reservation,
while an objection to the reservation does not preclude the
treaty coming into force between the objecting and the reserving
State, unless the objecting State opposes this (Vienna Con-
vention, Article 20, paragraph 4).
In 1949--1950, the problem of maximum participation in a
multilateral treaty arose in relation to objections taken to
reservations of parties to the Genocide Convention, 1948.
The questions of:---

(a) the admissibility and (b) the effect of
such reservations, and (c) the rights of States to object thereto,
were submitted for Advisory Opinion to the International
Court of Justice. The Court's views1 (being the views of the
1 _See_ Advisory Opinion on Reservations to the Genocide Convention, I.C.J.
Reports (1951), pp. 15 _et seq._

------
432
Part 4.- International Transactions
majority) may be summarised as follows: (a) Admissibility of
reservations.-Reservations are allowable notwithstanding the
absence of a provision in the Convention permitting them.
There need not necessarily be an express assent by other
interested States to the making of reservations, such assent
may be by implication, particularly in the case of certain
multilateral Conventions, where clauses are adopted by
majority vote of the drafting Conference. If a reservation
is compatible,1 objectively, with the nature and purpose of a
Convention, a State making it may be regarded as fully a party
to the instrument; this test of compatibility is consistent with
the principle that the Convention should have as universal an
operation as possible, and with the principle of "integrity
of the instrument. (b) Effect of reservations.---The same test
of compatibility applies; therefore, if a State rightly objects
that a reservation is incompatible with the Convention, it may
legitimately consider that the reserving State is not a party
thereto. (c) States entitled to object to reservations.-A State
entitled to sign or accept a Convention, but which has not
done so, cannot validly object to reservations; nor is an
objection by a signatory State, which has not ratified the
instrument, effective until its ratification.
This Advisory Opinion could not be said to have solved all
problems in this connection; it appeared to confer too extensive
a liberty to make reservaiions. The objective test of com-
patibility also bore hardly on signatory States which might not
have signed the instrument if they had subjectively realised
that certain drastic reservations would be made by other States.
It was significant that the International Law Commission which
at the request of the General Assembly also studied the problem
in 19512 did not follow the Court in the test of compatibility,
but stressed the necessity for consent to reservations, adopting
the view that it might be more important to maintain the
"integrity" of a Convention than to aim at its widest possible
1 According to the International Law Commission, where the treaty con-
cerned is the Constitution of an international organisation, this question of
compatibility should be determined by a competent organ of that organisa-
tion; _see_ Report for 1962, at p. 21 and _cf._ Vienna Convention, Article 20
paragraph 3.
2 Report of the Commission on the work of its Third session (1951), pp. 5--7.

Chap. 15.- Practice as to Treaties
433
acceptance. The Commission also suggested the insertion of
express provisions in Conventions dealing with the admissibility
or non-admissibility of reservations, and the effect of such
reservations when made. However, the General Assembly
in its Resolution of January 12, 1952, recommended to States
that they should be guided by the Court's Advisory Opinion.
Also, the general increase in the number of new States since
1952 emphasised the desirability of maximum participation by
such potential parties to Conventions, and therefore of greater
permissibility of reservations, as against a possible risk that the
integrity of a Convention may be impaired by a more liberal
admission of reservations. In the Vienna Convention (_see_
Article 19), the test of compatibility with the object and
purpose of the treaty was adopted, subject naturally to the
principles otherwise governing admissibility of reservations.
Various expedients have been tried in order to overcome
the complications caused by reservations. One method has at
least the merit of stark simplicity, that is, to provide by a
special clause in the Convention that no reservations at all are
permissible (_see_, e.g., Article 39 of the Convention on Damage
Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface,
signed at Rome on October 7, 1952), or none with regard to
certain important provisions (e.g. no reservations were allowed
as to Articles 1 to 3 of the Geneva Convention on the Con-
tinental Shelf of April 29, 1958). Other formulae allow special
kinds of reservations only. These methods of providing for
inadmissibility of reservations are recognised by the Vienna
Convention (_see_ Article 19) as valid and effective. One clause
1 As to the attitude to be adopted by the United Nations Secretariat as
depositary of reservations made by States, _see_ the General Assembly Resolution
of January 12, 1952, to the effect that a depositary should in regard to future
multilateral conventions maintain a neutral attitude, merely passing on docu-
ments to the interested States, leaving them to decide whether or not reserva-
tions are objectionable. This has been reaffirmed in a later Resolution of
December 7, 1959, showing that the directive applies to Conventions con-
cluded before, as well as after January 12, 1952.
This is a consideration which influenced the International Law Com-
mission in 1966; _see_ commentary on Articles 16--17, Draft Arts. I.L.C. The
Commission preferred a " flexible " system under which it is for each State
individually to decide whether to accept a reservation and treat the reserving
State as a party, and did not adopt the " collegiate" system (reserving State
a party only if a given proportion of other States concerned accept reservation).

------
434
Part 4.-International Transactions
now regularly inserted in Conventions permits States to make
reservations excluding the application of the Convention to
their territories. Another method is to specify certain admis-
sible reservations in a clause in the Convention, and to limit
the choice of any parties desiring to make reservations to these.
Probably the best method in the circumstances is to insert a
clause providing that the States parties to the Convention are
to be consulted as to all reservations intended to be made, with
presumed acceptance in default of reply within a fixed period;
but if objections are lodged against the reservations, the State
desiring to make them should be given the alternative of ratify-
ing or not ratifying without reservations. 1
It should be observed however that no method can be safely
followed in the future by contracting States wishing to make,
accept, or object to reservations, without carefully considering
the impact upon the particular treaty concerned of the pro-
visions as to reservations in Articles 19--23 of the Vienna
Convention, referred to above.

6.-REVISION AND AMENDMENT OF TREATIES
The terms "revision amendment", and "modifica-
tion" are in current use to denote the process of altering the
provisions of treaties. In the Vienna Convention (_see_ Part IV)
the words" amendment " and " modification" were used.
The term " revision " frequently carries some political
significance, being employed by States claiming that unjust or
unequal treaties should be reviewed, and final dispositions of
territory or frontiers adjusted. Such a re-examination, directed
to the peaceful change of situations formerly accepted as final,
may be a " revision " in the widest sense of the term, but is not
treaty revision as ordinarily understood, that is to say the
alteration of treaty provisions imposing continuing obligations.
For this reason, the words " amendment" and " modification'
are perhaps preferable to denote such an alteration.
1 Note the method used in the Convention concerning Customs Facilities
for Touring, of June 4, 1954 (_see_ Article 20; reservations made before signing
of Final Act admissible if accepted by a majority of the Conference, and
recorded in the Final Act, while reservations made after signing of Final Act
not admitted if objected to by one-third of the parties to the Convention).

------
Chap. 15.---Practice as to Treaties
435
The most usual way of ensuring reconciliation of the pro-
visions of treaties with changing conditions is through amend-
ment clauses inserted in the treaties themselves, thus giving
effect to the basic principle that a treaty may be amended by
agreement of the parties (_cf._ Vienna Convention, Article 39).
These clauses attempt to fix beforehand the particularities of
the procedure for amendment. They generally provide that
such procedure may be initiated at the request of one or a
number of parties, or through some authoritative international
organ. Then, usually, the move for amendment must be
endorsed by the States parties to the Convention and is carried
out by a Conference of these States at a subsequent time.
According to the clauses, the exact time at which the amend-
ment may be made falls broadly speaking into four classes :---


(a) at any time; (b) after the expiration of a prescribed period
dating from the entry into force of the Convention; (c) period-
ically, at the expiration of prescribed periods; and, (d) com-
binations of one or more of the preceding classes. Generally,
unanimity is required for the adoption of the amendments,
but the trend since 1945 is towards allowing amendment of
multilateral Conventions by a majority, if this is in the interests
of the international community. The main difficulty has been
in getting the parties to proceed promptly to ratification of the
proposed modification. This has led to the use of certain
expedients to obviate ratification. Sometimes the changes are
treated as being of minor importance only, and are effected
not under the procedure of the amendment clause, but by
means of a Procès-Verbal, Protocol, or other administrative
instrument opened to signature, which is regarded as sufficient.1
Sometimes, it is expressly provided in the Convention that
certain amendments may be carried out upon the recom-
mendation of an international organ, which may or may not
require endorsement-purely here an administrative act---of
the contracting parties.
_See_, for example, the Procès-Verbal of June, 1936, for amending Article 5
of the Geneva Drugs Convention, 1931. In some cases, non-ratifying parties
have been given an option of withdrawing from the Convention, or are
treated as non-parties if they do not ratify within a specific time.

------
436
Part 4.--International Transactions
The Vienna Convention purports in Articles 40--41 to lay
down certain principles governing the procedure and effect
of the amendment of multilateral treaties, such as the prin-
ciples that proposals for amendment must be notified to all
contracting States, that all such States are entitled to par-
ticipate in the process of amendment, that every State entitled
to adhere to the original treaty has a right to become party to
the amending treaty, and that two or more parties may,
subject to the provisions of the treaty itself and subject to
giving due notice to other parties, conclude an agreement to
modify the treaty as between themselves alone.
United Nations Charter and the Re-examination of Treaties
Article 14 of the United Nations Charter authorises the
General Assembly " to recommend measures for the peaceful
adjustment of any situation ... which it deems likely to
impair the general welfare or friendly relations among nations,
including situations resulting from a violation of the provisions
of the present Charter setting forth the purposes and Prin-
ciples of the United Nations " (i.e., the provisions of Articles 1
and 2). It has been maintained that Article 14 empowers the
General Assembly to initiate a process of peaceful change
through the readjustment of final settlements (e.g., of territory
or frontiers) under treaties, since the word " situations" is
capable of referring to " situations " both under executed and
under executory treaties. However, even assuming this to be
the correct interpretation of Article 14, the General Assembly
could not take any binding action in the direction of the peaceful
change of treaty settlements, as its powers in this connection
are recommendatory only.
وو
وو
1 Apart from this provision in the Charter, it is claimed that the Vienna
Convention provides, to some extent, machinery of peaceful change of situa-
tions under treaties, inasmuch as it enables States, which maintain that a
treaty has been invalidated by _jus cogens_ or terminated by fundamental
change of circumstances, to have disputes concerning such claims of invalidity
or termination of a treaty to be submitted to a process of judicial settlement,
arbitration, or conciliation (_see_ pp. 440, 443, post).

Chap. 15.---Practice as to Treaties
437
7.-- INCONSISTENT TREATIES; AND VALIDITY AND
DURATION OF TREATIES
Inconsistent Treaties
Some difficulty surrounds the question of the applicability
of a treaty which is inconsistent with the terms of an earlier
treaty.) The matter resolves itself essentially into one of
reconciliation of the obligations of the parties to both treaties.
If one of the treaties concerned specifies that it is subject
to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with an
earlier or subsequent treaty, the provisions of this latter treaty
should prevail (Vienna Convention, Article 30 paragraph 2).
Otherwise, as between parties to an earlier treaty who are also
parties to the later treaty, the earlier treaty governs only to the
extent that it is compatible with the later treaty (Article 30
paragraph 3). Moreover, as between a State party to both
treaties and a State party to only one of the treaties, the treaty
to which both States are parties is to apply.
It may be also that different considerations are applicable to
bilateral treaties or treaty-contracts, on the one hand, and to
multilateral Conventions, on the other hand. In the case of
conflicting multilateral Conventions, if the earlier Convention
does not in definite terms prohibit the later Convention and
if such later instrument is in the interests of the internationa
community,? or prescribes general rules of conduct, the later
Convention should not be held inapplicable, notwithstanding
that it derogates substantially from the earlier Convention and
that it has not been entered into by all of the parties to the other
instrument. Where the point turns on the construction of
ambiguous treaty provisions, there is a presumption of non-
conflict. Much may depend on whether there is or is not real
incompatibility, and on the intention of the parties to both
instruments; the two instruments may validly co-exist, if one
? _Cf._ for general discussion, Aufricht, Cornell Law Quarterly, Vol. 37 (1952),
at pp. 684 _et seq._, and _see also_ commentary on Article 26, Draft Arts. I.L.C.
2 This proviso is in accordance with the practice after the last war, as to
the revision or modification of pre-war Conventions, so far as this was
effected without the consent of all parties to the earlier instruments.

------
438
Part 4.-International Transactions
may be regarded as an annex to the other, facultatively
imposing wider or stricter obligations at the election of the
parties concerned (as in the case of the co-existence of the
Geneva Convention of 1936 for the Suppression of the Illicit
Traffic in Dangerous Drugs, and the penal repression pro-
visions of the Single Narcotic Drugs Convention signed at
New York on March 30, 1961).
The United Nations Charter contains its own rule of
inconsistency; under Article 103, the obligations of Member
States under the Charter are to prevail in the event of conflict
between the Charter and their obligations under other inter-
national instruments.
The Validity of Treaties?
The invalidation of treaties on grounds analogous to those
applicable in the domestic law of contracts, namely, contractual
incapacity, absence of consent due to mistake or fraud or
duress, and illegality, has been the subject of much doctrinal
speculation, some of which is both inconclusive and con-
troversial. However, a significant attempt to formulate
general principles in this area, capable of obtaining general
acceptance, was made in the Vienna Convention which dealt
with the following six grounds of invalidity of treaties:---


(1) Treaty-making incapacity. (2) Error. (3) Fraud. (4) Cor-
ruption. (5) Coercion. (6) Conflict with a norm of _jus
cogens_.

(1) Treaty-making incapacity.--Under Article 46 of the
Vienna Convention a State may not rely on the fact that its
representative exceeded his treaty-making powers under
internal law unless such excess of authority was:---

(a)" mani-
fest", i.e., objectively evident to the other negotiating State
acting in accordance with normal practice and in good faith;
and (b) concerned a rule of internal law of fundamental
importance. Article 47 deals with the case where a representa-
tive's authority is subject to a specific limitation in point of
_See_ Greig, International Law (1970), pp. 367--372; Oppenheim, Inter-
national Law, Vol. I (8th Edition, 1955), pp. 887--893.

------
Chap. 15.---Practice as to Treaties
439
fact; excess of authority is then not sufficient to invalidate that
representative's action unless the specific restriction on his
authority was notified beforehand to the other negotiating
States.

(2) Error.--A State is entitled to rely upon error as a ground
of invalidity of a treaty if the error be one as to a fact or
situation assumed by the State concerned to exist at the time
when the treaty was concluded, and which formed an essential
basis of its consent to the treaty. This ground is not open to
the State if it contributed to the error by its own conduct, or
the circumstances were such as to put it upon notice of a possible
error, or the error related only to the wording of the text of the
treaty (Vienna Convention, Article 48).

(3) Fraud.---This ground of invalidity applies where the
State relying upon it has been induced by the fraudulent con-
duct of another negotiating State to enter into the treaty
(Vienna Convention, Article 49). Fraud itself is not defined in
the Vienna Convention, and there is a recognised lack of inter-
national precedents as to what constitutes fraudulent conduct.

(4) Corruption.---If a State's consent to a treaty has been
procured through the corruption of its representative, directly
or indirectly by another negotiating State, the former State is
entitled to claim that the treaty is invalid (Vienna Convention,
Article 50).

(5) Coercion.---This ground is satisfied if:---

(a) a State's
consent to a treaty has been procured by the coercion of its
representative through acts or threats directed against him;

(b) the conclusion of the treaty has been procured by the threat
or use of force in violation of the principles of international
law embodied in the United Nations Charter? (_see_ Vienna
Convention, Articles 51--52).
1 Almost all the recorded instances of attempts to invalidate treaties on the
ground of error have concerned geographical errors, and most of them related
to errors in maps. _See_ cases referred to in Greig, International Law (1970),
pp. 371--372; and _cf._ American Journal of International Law, Vol. 64 (1970),
pp. 529--530.
2 _See_, in particular, Article 2 paragraph 4 of the Charter.

440
Part 4.-International Transactions

(6) Conflict with a norm of _jus cogens_.---A treaty is void if
at the time of its conclusion it conflicts with a norm of _jus cogens_
(as to _jus cogens_, _see_ pp. 59--61, _ante_).
The right to invalidate a treaty on the ground of treaty-
making incapacity, error, fraud, or corruption is lost if sub-
sequently the State expressly agrees that the treaty is valid or
remains in force, or its conduct is such as to lead to the
inference of acquiescence in the continued validity or application
of the treaty (Vienna Convention, Article 45).
A State relying upon the above-mentioned grounds of
invalidity must notify other parties of its claim so that the
procedure laid down in Articles 65--66 may be followed. This
may ultimately lead to a process of judicial settlement, arbitra-
tion, or conciliation with reference to any disputed claim.
Termination of Treaties
Treaties may be terminated by:---

(1) operation of law; or

(2) act or acts of the States parties.

(1) Termination of Treaties by Operation of Law


(i) Extinction of either party to a bilateral treaty, or of the
entire subject-matter of a treaty may discharge the instrument.1
In connection with the former case, questions of State succes-
sion may arise where the territory of the extinguished State
comes under the sovereignty of another State.2

(ii) Treaties may cease to operate upon the outbreak of war
between the parties. In some instances suspension of the treaty,
rather than actual termination, may be the result of such a war.
The matter is discussed in a later chapter.3

(iii) Except in the case of provisions for the protection of the
human person contained in treaties of a humanitarian character,
a material breach of a bilateral treaty by one party entitles the

other to terminate the treaty or to suspend its operation, while a
material breach of a multilateral treaty by one party may,
according to the circumstances, result in its termination as
between all parties, or as between the defaulting State and other
parties, or as between the defaulting State and a party specially
affected by the breach (Vienna Convention, Article 60).1

(iv) Impossibility of performance of the treaty due to the
permanent disappearance or destruction of an object indis-
pensable for the execution of the treaty will result in termina-
tion, but not if the impossibility is due to a breach of the treaty
itself, or of any other international obligation committed by
the party which seeks to terminate the treaty upon the ground
of such impossibility (Vienna Convention, Article 61). Case (i)
above may be regarded in a sense as an instance of impossibility
of performance.


(v) Treaties may be discharged as a result of what is
traditionally known as the rebus sic stantibus doctrine, although
there is a current trend to dispense with the appellation" rebus
sic stantibus". According to this doctrine, a fundamental
change in the state of facts which existed at the time the treaty
was concluded may be invoked as a ground for terminating the
treaty, or for withdrawing from it. It is also put that there is
necessarily an implied term or clause in the treaty---the clausula
rebus sic stantibus---to the effect that the treaty obligations
subsist only so long as the essential circumstances remain
unchanged. However, in its Report on the work of its 1966
(18th) Session, the International Law Commission rejected the
theory of an implied term, preferring to base the doctrine of
fundamental change upon grounds of equity and justice, and
even to discard the words rebus sic stantibus as carrying un-
desired implications.
The matter is now dealt with in Article 62 of the Vienna
1 _See_ Advisory Opinion of June 21, 1971, of the International Court of
Justice on the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of
South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa), where the Court upheld the
view that the failure of South Africa to comply with its obligation, as Man-
datory Power in South West Africa, to submit to supervision by United Nations
organs, resulted in the termination of its mandate, and therefore of its authority
to administer the Territory; _see_ I.C.J. Reports (1971), 16, at pp. 47--48.

Convention under the heading " fundamental change of
circumstances." The text of this article is as follows:---

Article 62
Fundamental change of circumstances
1. A fundamental change of circumstances which has occurred
   with regard to those existing at the time of the conclusion of a
   treaty, and which was not foreseen by the parties, may not be
   invoked as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from the
   treaty unless :
   (a) the existence of those circumstances constituted an
   essential basis of the consent of the parties to be
   bound by the treaty; and
   (b) the effect of the change is radically to transform the
   extent of obligations still to be performed under the
   treaty.
2. A fundamental change of circumstances may not be invoked
   as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from a treaty:
   (a) if the treaty establishes a boundary; or
   (b) if the fundamental change is the result of a breach by
   the party invoking it either of an obligation under the
   treaty or of any other international obligation owed
   to any other party to the treaty.
3. If, under the foregoing paragraphs, a party may invoke a
   fundamental change of circumstances as a ground for ter-
   minating or withdrawing from a treaty it may also invoke the
   change as a ground for suspending the operation of the treaty."
   It will be observed that paragraph 1 of this article of the
   Vienna Convention involves a combination of two tests, the
   subjective test, on the one hand, that the parties to the treaty
   should have envisaged the continuance of the circumstances
   surrounding its conclusion as a decisive motivating factor in
   entering into the treaty, and the objective test, on the other
   hand, that the change must be so fundamental as radically to
   alter the obligations of the parties. The article excludes
   reliance on mere onerousness of treaty obligations, felt by a
   party at a period later than the date of the conclusion of the

Chap. 15.---Practice as to Treaties
443
treaty, as of itself sufficient ground for a claim to be released
from the treaty. There is no requirement that the fundamental
change must occur only after a certain period of time, and this
is in accordance with the current realities of international
affairs, as cataclysmic changes can occur on the international
scene even within months. Also the article does not preclude
parties to a treaty from expressly stipulating what fundamental
changes will entitle them to withdraw from the treaty.1
A party invoking this ground of fundamental change must
give notice under Articles 65--66 of the Vienna Convention to
the other parties of its claim that the treaty has been terminated,
stating its reasons, so as to set in motion the procedure laid
down in these articles. In other words, there is no automatic
termination of a treaty as a result of the doctrine of funda-
mental change.

(vi) A treaty specifically concluded for a fixed period of time
terminates upon the expiration of that period.

(vii) If successive denunciations (_see below_ as to the meaning
of " denunciation ") of a multilateral treaty reduce the number
of States parties to less than the number prescribed by the
treaty for its entry into force, the treaty may cease to operate
if this be expressly or impliedly provided; otherwise a multi-
lateral treaty does not terminate by reason only of the fact
that the number of parties falls below the number necessary
for its coming into force (Vienna Convention, Article 55).

(viii) Article 64 of the Vienna Convention provides that
if a new peremptory norm of _jus cogens_ (_see_ p. 59, _ante_)
emerges, any existing treaty which is in conflict with that
norm becomes void and terminates. This is a controversial
provision, and in the light of the opposition that it encountered
at the Vienna Conference of 1968--1969 which drew up the
1 _See_, e.g., Article IV of the Nuclear Weapons Test Ban Treaty of 1963
referred to, p. 191, _ante_, entitling a party to withdraw if it decides that " extra-
ordinary events" related to the subject-matter of the Treaty have jeopardised
its" supreme interests ".

Part 4.--International Transactions
Convention, cannot be said to contain a universally accepted
rule of international law. One major objection to it is that no
treaty can be safely entered into without being exposed to the
hazard of subsequent invalidation by reason of some un-
anticipated future development in the higher governing
principles of international law. Nor, _semble_, can parties by
any provision now made in a treaty, agree to exclude such a
hazard, for such an exclusionary provision would presumably
itself be invalidated by the force of _jus cogens_.

(2) Termination of Treaties by Act or Acts of the Parties


(i) The termination of a treaty or the withdrawal of a party
may take place in conformity with the provisions of the treaty,
or at any time by consent of all the parties after consultation
_inter se_ (Vienna Convention, Article 54). A treaty will also
be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a
subsequent treaty relating to the same subject-matter, and it
appears from this later treaty or otherwise that the parties
intended that the matter be governed by that treaty, or that
the provisions of this later treaty are so far incompatible with
those of the earlier treaty that the two instruments cannot be
applied at the same time (Vienna Convention, Article 59).

(ii) When a State party wishes to withdraw from a treaty, it
usually does so by notice of termination, or by act of denuncia-
tion. The term " denunciation " denotes the notification by a
State to other States parties that it intends to withdraw from
the treaty. Ordinarily, the treaty itself provides for denuncia-
tion, or the State concerned may, with the consent of other
parties, have reserved a right of denunciation. In the absence
of such provision, denunciation and withdrawal are not admis-
sible, and all the other parties must as a rule consent to the
denunciation or withdrawal, unless it is established that the
parties intended to admit the possibility of denunciation or
withdrawal, or a right of denunciation or withdrawal may be
implied by the nature of the treaty (Vienna Convention,
Article 56). The practical difficulty with regard to denunciation
or withdrawal by a State is the possibility of embarrassment to

------
Chap. 15.---Practice as to Treaties
445
the other States parties wishing to continue their participation
in the treaty, by disturbing the general equilibrium of rights and
obligations which originally made the treaty possible.
In practice, multilateral Conventions contain a special clause
allowing denunciation after the expiration of a certain period
of time from the date of entry into force of the Convention.
This clause may provide that a denunciation will not take effect
until a certain time (e.g., one year) after it is given.
Suspension of Operation of Treaties
The operation of a treaty may be suspended, in regard to
either all parties or a particular party:---

(a) in conformity
with the provisions of the treatyl; or (b) at any time by the
consent of all parties after consultation (Vienna Convention,
Article 57); or (c) through the conclusion of a subsequent
treaty, if this be the intention of the parties (Vienna Con-
vention, Article 59). Subject to the provisions of the treaty
concerned, and its object and purpose, two or more parties to
a multilateral treaty may suspend its operation as between
themselves alone (Article 58).
8.-INTERPRETATION OF TREATIES
Agencies of Interpretation
These agencies of interpretation may be Courts such as:---


(a) the International Court of Justice; and (b) the Court of
Justice of the three European Communities, which has juris-
diction to interpret the Treaties of April 18, 1951 and March 25,
1957 establishing these three Communities. Treaties are also
interpreted by international technical organs, such as the Inter-
national Labour Office and the various organs of the United

Nations, and by the Executive Directors and Board of
Governors of the International Monetary Fund. Other
expedients may be resorted to; for example, reference of the
point to an ad hoc Committee of Jurists.
Instruments of Interpretation
Diplomatic Conferences which adopt a treaty are only too
conscious themselves of drafting defects. To avoid any
difficulties arising out of the construction of particular clauses
or Articles, an instrument such as a Protocol, or Procès-Verbal,
or Final Act is often annexed to the main Convention con-
taining a detailed interpretation or explanation of the doubtful
provisions.
Multilingual Treaties
Treaties are often drafted in two or more languages. Multi-
lateral Conventions, including Conventions of the International
Labour Organisation, are usually concluded in two languages-
English and French-and it is provided that both texts shall
be authoritative.3 In some instances it is declared that the
English or French text as the case may be shall prevail in the
event of a conflict. The United Nations Charter, 1945, was
drawn up in five languages-Chinese, French, Russian,
English and Spanish--and it was provided by Article 111 that
the five texts were to be " equally authentic ".4
Article 33 of the Vienna Convention provides :---

(a) that
1 It was recognised at the San Francisco Conference which in 1945 drew
up the United Nations Charter that each organ of the United Nations would
have largely to do its own interpretative work; _see_ Report of the Rapporteur
of Committee IV/2 of the Conference, pp. 7--8.
2 Under Article XVIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund; _see_ Hexner, American Journal of International Law (1959),
Vol. 53, pp. 341--370.
* This means that, generally speaking, the two texts may be read in con-
  junction in order to ascertain the meaning of the Convention. Also, in the
  event of discrepancies, _prima facie_, the least extensive interpretation should
  be adopted. Where the treaty is silent as to the equivalence of the two texts,
  possibly greater weight should be given to the language in which the instrument
  was first drawn up. But _see now_ Vienna Convention, Article 33.
* For rules of interpretation of multi-lingual treaties, _see_ Article 29, Draft
  Arts. I.L.C., commentary, pp. 108--113.

------
Chap. 15.-- Practice as to Treaties
447
if a treaty is authenticated in several languages, the text is
equally authoritative in each language unless the treaty provides
or the parties agree that one particular text is to prevail in case
of divergence; (b) that the terms of the treaty are presumed to
have the same meaning in each text; (c) that a construction
may be given which best reconciles the texts having regard to
the object and purpose of the treaty.
General Principles of Treaty Interpretation
Numerous rules, canons, and principles have been laid
down by international tribunals, and by writers to be used as
tools in the interpretation of treaties, and to serve as useful,
indeed necessary, guidelines to the drafting of treaty provisions.
These rules, canons, and principles, although sometimes invested
with the sanctity of dogmas, are not absolute formulae, but are
in every sense relative--relative to the particular text, and to
the particular problem that is in question. To some extent,
like presumptions in the law of evidence, their weight may
depend on the cumulative application of several, rather than
the application of one singly.
The following is a summary of the more general principles?:---


(1) Grammatical interpretation, and the intention of the
parties.--Words and phrases are in the first instance to be
construed according to their plain and natural meaning.2
However, if the grammatical interpretation would result in an
absurdity, or in marked inconsistency with other portions of
1 For references to the various authorities on which the above summary is
based, _see_ Hudson, The Permanent Court of International Justice, 1920--1942,
pp. 640--661; Hyde, American Journal of International Law (1930), Vol. 24,
pp. 1--19; J. F. Hogg, " International Court: Rules of Treaty Interpretation

1960), pp. 5--73; I. Tammelo, Treaty Interpretation and Practical Reason
(1967); commentary on Draft Arts. I.L.C., Articles 27--29.
2 This principle was reaffirmed by the International Court of Justice in the
Advisory Opinion on the Constitution of the Maritime Safety Committee of
the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, I.C.J. Reports
(1960), 150 (words largest ship-owning nations" in Article 28 of the Con-
vention of March 6, 1948, establishing the Organisation, held to mean the
countries with the largest figures of registered tonnage, without regard to
questions of the real national ownership). Under the Vienna Convention,
Article 31, paragraph 1, a treaty is to be interpreted in good faith in accor-
dance with the ordinary meaning to be given" to its terms in their context
and in the light of its object and purpose.

Part 4.--International Transactions
the treaty, or would clearly go beyond the intention of the
parties, it should not be adopted.
The related rules concerning the intention of the parties
proceed from the capital principle that it is to the intention
of the parties at the time the instrument was concluded, and
in particular the meaning attached by them to words and
phrases at the time, that primary regard must be paid. Hence,
it is legitimate to consider what was the "purpose or " plan
of the parties in negotiating the treaty. Nor should a treaty
be interpreted so as to restrict unduly the rights intended to be
protected by it. What must be ascertained is the ostensible
intention of the parties, as disclosed in the four corners of the
actual text; only in exceptional circumstances is it permissible
to investigate other material to discover this intention. More-
over, a special meaning must be given to a particular term, if
it is established that the parties so intended (Vienna Conven-
tion, Article 31, paragraph 4).

(2) Object and Context of Treaty.---If particular words and
phrases in a treaty are doubtful, their construction should be
governed by the general object of the treaty, and by the context.
Article 31 paragraph 1 of the Vienna Convention lays down that
a treaty should be interpreted by reference to its " object " and
"purpose". The context need not necessarily be the whole
of the treaty, but the particular portion in which the doubtful
word or phrase occurs. However, for the purposes of inter-
pretation, it can include the preamble and annexes to the
treaty, and related agreements or instruments made in con-
nection with the conclusion of the treaty (Vienna Convention,
Article 31 paragraph 2).

(3) Reasonableness and Consistency.---Treaties should, it is
held, be given an interpretation in which the reasonable
meaning of words and phrases is preferred, and in which a
consistent meaning is given to different portions of the instru-
ment. In accordance with the principle of consistency, treaties
should be interpreted in the light of existing international law.

treaty in the Case Concerning the Application of the Convention of 1902 Govern-
ing the Guardianship of Infants (Netherlands-Sweden), I.C.J. Reports (1958), 55.

" of the

Also applying both reasonableness and consistency, since it is
to be assumed that States entering into a treaty are as a rule
unwilling to limit their sovereignty save in the most express
terms, ambiguous provisions should be given a meaning which
is the least restrictive upon a party's sovereignty, or which
casts the least onerous obligations; and in the event of a
conflict between a general and a special provision in a treaty,
the special provisions should control the general (_cf._ the
municipal law maxim, lex specialis derogat generali), unless
the general stipulation is clearly intended to be overriding.

(4) The Principle of Effectiveness.---This principle, par-
ticularly stressed by the Permanent Court of International
Justice, requires that the treaty should be given an interpretation
which " on the whole " will render the treaty "most effective
and useful ",1 in other words, enabling the provisions of the
treaty to work and to have their appropriate effects. This
principle is of particular importance in the construction of
multilateral Conventions, containing the constituent rules of
international organisations. It does not, however, warrant
an interpretation which works a revision of a Convention, or
any result contrary to the letter and spirit of treaties. 3

(5) Recourse to Extrinsic Material.---Normally, the inter-
preting tribunal is limited to the context of the treaty.
However, the following may be resorted to, provided that
clear words are not thereby contradicted:---

(a) Past history,
and historical usages relevant to the treaty. (b) Preparatory
work (travaux préparatoires), i.e., preliminary drafts, records
of Conference discussions, draft amendments, etc. This may
be taken into account where normal interpretation leaves the
meaning ambiguous or obscure, or leads to a result which is
manifestly absurd or unreasonable (Vienna Convention,
2

_See_, e.g., Advisory Opinion on Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the
Service of the United Nations, I.C.J. Reports (1949), p. 174, for an illustration
of the application of this principle, in order to enable an international
organisation to function more effectively.

Article 32), and more particularly to confirm a conclusion
reached by normal methods of construction. Merely abortive
proposals, or secret or confidential negotiatory documents
will not be so used, nor will preparatory work be given weight
against a State party which did not participate in the negotia-
tions, unless the records of such preparatory work have been
published. (c) Interpretative Protocols, Resolutions, and Com-
mittee Reports, setting out agreed interpretations. Unless
these form part of the treaty?, they will be treated as on the
same level as preparatory work, subject to certain of such
documents having greater weight than others, according to
circumstances. (d) A subsequent agreement between the
parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the applica-
tion of its provisions (Vienna Convention, Article 31 para-
graph 3). (e) Subsequent conduct of the States parties, as
evidencing the intention of the parties and their conception
of the treaty, although a subsequent interpretation adopted
by them is binding only if it can be regarded as a new supple-
mentary agreement. Under the Vienna Convention (_see_
Article 31 paragraph 3), a subsequent practice in the applica-
tion of the treaty, establishing agreement regarding its inter-
pretation, may be assimilated to such a supplementary agree-
ment. (f) Other treaties, in pari materia, in case of doubt.
Disputes Clause
It is now a general practice to insert a disputes clause in
multilateral Conventions providing for methods of settling
disputes arising as to the interpretation or application of the
Convention. The alternative methods usually specified are
negotiation between the parties, arbitration, conciliation, or
judicial settlement.
1 Ibid., at pp. 43--44.
2 _Cf._ the Ambatielos Case, I.C.J. Reports (1952), pp. 28 _et seq._, showing that
a declaration subscribed to by parties who contemporaneously drew up a
treaty, may be part of such treaty; and that the conduct of the parties may
be looked to in this connection to ascertain whether the declaration was so
regarded.
