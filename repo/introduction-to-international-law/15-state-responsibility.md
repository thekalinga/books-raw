CHAPTER 9
STATE RESPONSIBILITY
1.--NATURE AND KINDS OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY
FREQUENTLY action taken by one State results in injury to,
or outrage on, the dignity or prestige of another State. The
rules of international law as to State responsibility concern
the circumstances in which, and the principles whereby, the
injured State becomes entitled to redress for the damage
suffered. 1
Obviously the redress to be obtained will depend on the
circumstances of the case. Most usually the injured State
will attempt to get satisfaction (as it is called) through diplo-
matic negotiations, and if only its dignity has been affected, a
formal apology from the responsible State or an assurance
against the repetition of the matters complained of, will
generally be regarded as sufficient. Pecuniary reparation, as
distinct from satisfaction, is, however, sometimes necessary,
particularly where there has been material loss or damage,
and in many instances the question of liability and the amount
of compensation have to be brought for adjudication before
an international arbitral tribunal.
The wrongs or injuries which give rise to State responsibility
may be of various kinds. Thus a State may become responsible
for breach of a treaty, in respect of the non-performance of
contractual obligations, for injuries to citizens of another
State, and so on. The breach of duty may be:---

(a) an act,
or (b) an omission.
In ultimate analysis, State responsibility is governed by
international standards (although in particular branches an
international standard may incorporate a national standard),
and it depends on international law whether and to what
extent the act or omission of a particular State is deemed
legitimate or wrongful. Where the acts or omissions of a State
1 The subject of State responsibility has been under consideration for some
time by the International Law Commission.

294
Part 3.--Rights, etc., of States
measured by such standards are held to be legitimate, State
responsibility does not arise. For example, as all States are
generally conceded to have complete power to refuse to admit
aliens into their territory, the States of which the aliens are
nationals have no claim against any State which has refused
ingress. Similarly, where international law concedes jurisdic-
tion to a State which proceeds to exercise it, there is no breach
of duty for which that State is responsible.
The law of State responsibility is still in evolution, and may
possibly advance to the stage where States are fixed also with
responsibility for breaches of international law which are
"international crimes ".1
Another important matter which will have incidence on the
developing law of State responsibility is the extent to which
States are or may become involved in the control of ultra-
hazardous activities, e.g. nuclear experiments, the development
of nuclear energy, space exploration, and the " sonic boom"
or "sonic bang" of new types of aircraft. This is not a
domain in which traditional diplomatic procedures of protest,
demands for satisfaction, and claims can be of avail. Dangers
must be anticipated, and if possible completely excluded;
e.g., if there be such a risk as an alteration of the environment
of the earth. It may be necessary to impose strict duties of
consultation, notification, registration and providing informa-
tion, while even a process of injunction, mandatory or restrain-
ing, may need to be developed. There may be room for other
international safeguards.
1 At the 1962 session of the International Law Commission, some members
were of the opinion that " under modern international law, State responsibility
arose less in connection with the treatment of aliens than as a result of acts
which endangered or might endanger international peace, such as aggression,
denial of national independence, or of exchange of friendly relations with
States, and violations of provisions of the United Nations Charter (_see_
Report of Commission on the work of its Fourteenth Session, 1962, at p. 31).
One of the principles proclaimed in the Declaration on Principles of Inter-
national Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States
in accordance with the United Nations Charter, adopted by the General
Assembly in 1970, is:---
" A war of aggression constitutes a crime against the
peace, for which there is responsibility under international law".
_See_ pp. 192--203, _ante_.

Chap. 9.--State Responsibility
295
Federal States
The question frequently arises as to the incidence of liability
when injury is done by or through a State Member of a Federa-
tion or by or through a protected State. The accepted rule
appears to be that the Federal State and the protecting State
are responsible for the conduct respectively of the State
Member and the protected State, inasmuch as in the realm of
foreign affairs they alone are recognised as having capacity
to enter into relations with other States. This is true even
although the facts and events which give rise to responsibility
are actually matters constitutionally within the exclusive
competence of the State Member or the protected State. In
this connection it will be no defence to an international claim
to plead the provisions of the Federal Constitution or of the
treaty of protection. British practice has adopted these
principles, and in the course of the preparatory work for the
Hague Codification Conference of 1930 it was officially stated
on behalf of Great Britain that:---

" The distribution of powers between (a Federal State) and
the other or subordinate units on whose behalf it is entitled
to speak is a domestic matter with which foreign States are
not concerned".
Limits between International Law and Municipal Law
It is important when considering practical cases of State
responsibility to keep clearly in mind the limits between
international law and municipal law. This distinction has a
particular bearing on two matters :---

(a) the breach of duty or
non-performance by a State of some international rule of
conduct which is alleged to give rise to responsibility; (b) the
authority or competence of the State agency through which
the wrong has been committed.
As to (a), the breach or omission must in ultimate analysis
be a breach of, or omission to conform to, some rule of
international law. It is immaterial that the facts bring
into question rights and duties under municipal law as
between the State alleged to be responsible and the citizens

------
296
Part 3.--Rights, etc., of States
of the claimant State. Further, it is no answer to an inter-
national claim to plead that there has been no infraction of
municipal law if at the same time a rule of international law
has been broken.
As to (b), it is in general not open to any State to defend a
claim by asserting that the particular State agency which
actually committed the wrongful act exceeded the scope of its
authority under municipal law. A preliminary inquiry as to
the agency's authority under municipal law is necessary as a
matter of course, but if, notwithstanding that the agency acted
beyond the scope of its authority, international law declares
that the State is responsible, international law prevails over
municipal law.
It follows from these two principles, (a) and (b), that as
already mentioned in Chapter 4 above, a State may not invoke
its municipal law as a reason for evading performance of an
international obligation.
2.--RESPONSIBILITY FOR BREACH OF TREATY, OR IN RESPECT OP
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS; EXPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY2
State responsibility for breach of a treaty obligation depends
upon the precise terms of the treaty provision alleged to have
been infringed. More often than not this raises purely a
question of construction of the words used. If the treaty
provision is broken, responsibility follows. According to the
Permanent Court of International Justice in the Chorzów
Factory (Indemnity) Case, it is a principle of international
law that " any breach of an engagement involves an obligation
to make reparation ".
Somewhat different considerations apply to the case of con-
tracts entered into between a State and alien citizens or corpora-
tions. A breach by a State of such a contract will not necessarily

engage its responsibility at international law, nor will such
responsibility, when it exists, be identical in kind with the
liability under the contract. Here, the responsibility at inter-
national law arises only if the State breaks some duty extraneous
to the contract, for example, if it be guilty of a denial of justice
to the other contracting party. A State may, however, im-
pliedly contract with another State that it will observe the
terms of arrangement with a citizen of the latter State, although
it would seem from the decision of the International Court of
Justice in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Case (Jurisdiction)
that weighty proof is required of such an implied treaty.
The responsibility of a State for expropriating foreign private
property is an entirely different matter, and here modern
conditions appear to have wrought changes. In the nineteenth
century, any expropriation of the property of a foreign citizen
would have been regarded as a clear basis for an international
claim. At the present time, however, the widening control by
States over the national economy and over almost every aspect
of private enterprise, and the measures of nationalisation of
different industries adopted by so many States, make it difficult
to treat, as contrary to international law, an expropriation of
foreign property for a public purpose in accordance with a
11.C.J. Reports (1952), at pp. 109 _et seq._; there the British Government
claimed that when, in 1933, it sponsored the conclusion of a new oil concession
contract between Persia and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Persia engaged
itself towards Great Britain not to annul or alter the concession. The Court
rejected the contention, holding that there was no privity of contract between
Persia and Great Britain (ibid., at p. 112).
2 The terms "nationalisation and confiscation" have also been used.
The term expropriation appears, however, to be the generic term, and to
include" nationalisation ", i.e. the taking of property by a State with view to
its continued exploitation by that State in lieu of the exploitation by private
enterprise; _see_ Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. v. Idemitzu Kosan Kabushiki Kaisha,
International Law Reports (1953), 305, for the view that nationalisation is
merely a species of expropriation. The term confiscation is used to
denote a temporary acquisition of property, as in time of war or an arbitrary
or penal taking of property, without compensation (_cf._ García Amador's
Fifth Report on International Responsibility, presented in 1960 to the Inter-
national Law Commission).

Part 3.-Rights, etc., of States
declared domestic policy, applied without discrimination to the
citizens of the expropriating State and to aliens alike."
Practice, doctrine, and case-law unite in showing that to be
valid under international law, an expropriation of foreign
property must:---

(1) be for a public purpose or in the public
interest; (2) not discriminate against aliens as such; (3) not
involve the commission of any unjustified irregularity.
It is believed also that an expropriation of foreign property
is contrary to international law if it does not provide for the
prompt payment by the expropriating State of just, adequate,
and effective compensation. On the other hand, some writers
maintain and some Courts have held that the absence of any
such proper provision for compensation does not render the
expropriation illegal under international law, but that at most
there is a duty to pay such compensation, the expropriation
remaining lawful for all purposes, including transfer of title.
There is even a difference of opinion concerning the measure
of the compensation payable; some writers are of the opinion
that it need only be reasonable in the circumstances, having
regard to the state of the economy of the expropriating State.
It is clear, however, that compensation which is of a nominal
value only, or which is indefinitely postponed, or which is the
subject of a vague and non-commital promise, or which is
below the rate of compensation awarded to nationals of the
expropriating State, is contrary to international law.
In the case of an unlawful expropriation, the expropriating
State must, in addition to paying the compensation due in

mic, Social and Cultural Rights of December 16, 1966, that developing
countries, "with due regard to human rights and their national economy
may determine to what extent they will guarantee to non-nationals the economic
rights recognised in the Covenant.

respect of a lawful expropriation, pay also damages for any loss
sustained by the injured party.
An English Court will not recognise or enforce a foreign
expropriation law which is unlawful, in the sense mentioned
above, 2 of being a purely confiscatory measure.
The " Calvo Clause"
It is convenient at this point to discuss the clauses of the
type known as the " Calvo Clause".
Calvo Clause". These clauses (named
after the Argentinian jurist, Calvo) are frequently inserted in
contracts between Central and South American Governments
and foreign companies or persons to whom concessions or
other rights are granted under the contracts. Under such a
clause the foreign concessionaire renounces the protection or
assistance of his government in any matters arising out of the
contract. The following clause, which was adjudicated upon
in the North American Dredging Company Case3 before the
United States-Mexico General Claims Commission, is an
example:---

" The contractor and all persons, who, as employees or in
any other capacity, may be engaged in the execution of the
work under this contract either directly or indirectly shall be
considered as Mexicans in all matters, within the Republic of
Mexico, concerning the execution of such work and the fulfil-
ment of this contract. They shall not claim, nor shall they
have, with regard to the interests and the business connected
with this contract, any other rights or means to enforce the
same than those granted by the laws of the Republic to
Mexicans, nor shall they enjoy any other rights than those
established in favour of Mexicans. They are consequently
deprived of any rights as aliens, and under no conditions shall
the intervention of foreign diplomatic agents be permitted, in
any matter related to this contract ".
The object of such a clause is to ensure that legal disputes
arising out of the contract shall be referred to the municipal

Part 3.--Rights, etc., of States
Courts of the State granting the concession or other rights,
and to oust the jurisdiction of international arbitral tribunals
or to prevent any appeal for diplomatic action to the national
State of the company or individual enjoying the concession,
etc. Its insertion in so many contracts with Latin American
States was due to the number of occasions when on rather
weak pretexts concessionaire companies or persons in these
States sought the intervention of their own governments to
protect their interests without any recourse to the remedies
available in local municipal Courts.
There have been several conflicting decisions by international
arbitral tribunals on the legality of the Calvo Clause. In a
number of cases it has been held null and void on the ground
that an individual cannot contract away the right of his govern-
ment to protect him. In other cases the arbitrators have
treated it as valid and as barring the claim before them. Thus,
in the North American Dredging Company Case (p. 299), the
United States-Mexico General Claims Commission dismissed
the claim on the ground that under the clause it was the duty
of the claimant company to use the remedies existing under the
laws of Mexico, and on the facts the company had not done
this. This decision has been accepted by the British Govern-
ment as good law. On the other hand, in the case of the
El Oro Mining and Railway Co., Ltd., where the Calvo Clause
was pleaded as a defence, the British-Mexican General Claims
Commission declined to dismiss the claim inasmuch as the
claimant company had actually filed suit in a Mexican Court,
and nine years had elapsed without a hearing. Therefore, it
could not be said that the claimant company had sought to
oust the local jurisdiction.
Perhaps the better opinion as to the Calvo Clause may be
summed up as follows:---


(1) In so far as such clause attempts to waive in general
the sovereign right of a State to protect its citizens, it is to
that extent void.
1 Annual Digest of Public International Law Cases, 1931--1932, No. 100.

------
Chap. 9.-State Responsibility
301

(2) But, to quote a statement of the British Government,
" There is no rule to prevent the inclusion of a stipulation in
a contract that in all matters pertaining to the contract, the
jurisdiction of the local tribunals shall be complete and
exclusive". In other words, it would be obviously improper
for the individual to treat the State against which he seeks
redress as an inferior and untrustworthy country, and to apply
for his government's intervention without making any claim
in the local Courts.

(3) Where such a stipulation purports to bind the claimant's
government not to intervene in respect of a clear violation of
international law, it is void.
To sum up, it may be said that the Calvo Clause is ineffective
to bar the right of States to protect their nationals abroad, or
to release States from their duty to protect foreigners on their
territory.
Debts
Claims asserting the responsibility of a State for debts more
frequently arise in cases of State succession where an annexing
or successor State seeks to evade the financial obligations of
its predecessor. Such claims also occur, however, in many
other cases where governments fail in the service of loans or
default in contributions to international institutions of which
they are members.
Three theories have been advanced as to the right of a State
to protect subjects, creditors of another State:---


(1) Lord Palmerston's theory, enunciated in 1848, that the
former State is entitled to intervene diplomatically, and even
to resort to military intervention as against a defaulting debtor
State.

(2) The "Drago Doctrine" (so called after the Argentinian
Minister of Foreign Affairs who first affirmed it in 1902) that
States are duty bound not to use against a defaulting debtor
State compulsory measures such as armed military action.
This doctrine was intended to apply in favour of Central and
South American States as a virtual corollary to the Monroe

------
302
Part 3.---Rights, etc., of States
Doctrinel; accordingly, in its later form, it laid down that
the public debts of such American States could not occasion
armed intervention nor even the actual occupation of the
territory of American nations by a European Power".
Drago's objections were principally confined to the use of
armed force in the collection of public debts; he was not
directly opposed to diplomatic intervention or to claims before
international tribunals. Subsequently, the Hague Convention
of 1907 for limiting the Employment of Force for the Recovery
of Contract Debts provided that the States parties to the
Convention would not resort to armed force in order to
recover contract debts due to their nationals by another State,
except where the State refused to accept arbitration or to
submit to an arbitral award.2

(3) According to the most generally accepted theory, the
obligation of a debtor State is similar in all respects to
obligations under international agreements in general. There-
fore no special rules nor special methods of redress are
applicable where a debtor State defaults.
3.-RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNATIONAL DELINQUENCIES
(WRONGS UNCONNECTED WITH CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS)
In practice, most cases of State responsibility, at least before
international tribunals, arise out of wrongs alleged to have
been committed by the State concerned. By wrong in this
connection is meant the breach of some duty which rests on
a State at international law and which is not the breach of a
purely contractual obligation. To such wrongs, more fre-
quently the term " international delinquency" is applied. It is
too early yet to measure the effects of the impact on the present
topic of the increasing tendency under international law to cast
responsibility on individuals for delinquencies (_see_ Chapter 3,
above).
1 _See above_, pp. 114--115.
* Having regard to the obligations of States Members of the United Nations
  to settle their disputes peacefully, and to refrain from the threat or use of
  force against other States (_see_ Article 2 of Charter), the "Drago Doctrine "
  has lost much of its importance and application.

------
Chap. 9.--State Responsibility
303
Most of the cases which come under this head concern
injuries suffered by citizens abroad. Indeed, the topic of
protection of citizens abroad really makes up most of the
law on this subject. These injuries may be of different kinds,
for example, injuries to property in the course of riots, personal
injuries, improper arrests by the local authorities, the refusal
of local judicial tribunals to accord justice or due redress, and
so on. Generally speaking, a person who goes to live in the
territory of a foreign State must submit to its laws; but that is
not to say that certain duties under international law in respect
to the treatment of that person do not bind the State. Examples
are the duty on the State to provide proper judicial remedies
for damage suffered, and the duty to protect alien citizens from
gratuitous personal injury by its officials or subjects.
It may be said that according to international law, aliens
resident in a country have a certain minimum of rights necessary
to the enjoyment of life, liberty and property, but these are
most difficult to define.
In the subject of international delinquencies, it is important
to apply the notion of imputability. This notion assists in
clarifying the subject and in providing a proper framework for
its theory. To take a practical example, if an agency of
State X has caused injury to a citizen of State Y in breach of
international law, technically we say that State X will be
responsible to State Y for the injury done. What this means
is that the organ or official of State X has committed a wrongful
act, and the conduct in breach of international law is imputed
from the organ or official to the State. The imputation is thus
the result of the intellectual operation necessary to bridge the
gap between the delinquency of the organ or official, and the
attribution of breach and liability to the State.1
>>
1 The Harvard Draft Convention on the International Responsibility of
States for Injuries to Aliens uses the expression "attributable rather than
" imputable'' (_see_ Articles 1 and 15). In connection with State responsibility,
the International Law Commission also preferred "attribution " to " imputa-
tion", upon the ground that this would obviate the ambiguities inherent in
the notions of "imputation" and "imputability", which are used in an
entirely different sense in certain systems of internal criminal law; _see_ Report
of the Commission on the Work of its Twenty-second Session (1970), para-
graph 77.

------
304
Part 3.---- Rights, etc., of States
The practical necessity of the notion is founded on the
importance of keeping clear the limits between international
law and municipal or State law. Breaches of duty by State
agencies may be imputed to the respondent State according to
rules of international law, even though under municipal law
such acts would not have been imputed to that State, because,
for example, the agency concerned had acted outside the scope
of its authority.
Imputability therefore depends on the satisfaction of two
conditions :---

(a) conduct of a State organ or official in breach
of an obligation defined in a rule of international law; (b) that
according to international law, the breach will be attributed
to the State. It is only if the breach is imputable that the
State becomes internationally responsible for the delinquency.
Responsibility begins where imputability ends. As has been
emphasised by the International Law Commission1:---

".... The attribution of an act or omission to the State as
an international legal person is an operation which of necessity
falls within the scope of international law. As such it is dis-
tinct from the parallel operation which may, but need not
necessarily, take place under internal law."
In establishing the incidence of State responsibility, the
inquiry proceeds as follows:---


(1) It is first of all necessary to determine whether the State
organ or official guilty of the relevant act or omission had or
had not a general authority under municipal law in that
connection.

(2) If it be found that the State organ or official has this
general competence the next matter to be investigated is
whether the breach of duty is or is not imputable, so as to
make the State responsible at international law. Here inter-
national law acts entirely autonomously. For instance, it may
be that although the State organ or official exceeded the
authority conferred by municipal law, international law will
none the less impute liability to the State. Thus, in the
>>

Report of the Commission on the Work of its Twenty-second Session
(1970), paragraph 77.

------
Chap. 9.--State Responsibility
305
Youmans Case, a lieutenant of State forces in a town in
Mexico was ordered by the mayor of the town to proceed
with troops to quell riots against and stop attacks being made
on certain American citizens. The troops, on arriving at the
scene of the riot, instead of dispersing the mob, opened fire
on the house in which the Americans were taking refuge and
killed one of them. The other two American citizens were
then forced to leave the house, and as they did so were killed
by the troops and the mob. The troops had disobeyed superior
orders by their action in opening fire. It was held that the
Mexican Government was responsible for the wrongful acts of
the soldiers even though they had acted beyond the scope of
their authority.

(3) But if it be ascertained that the State organ or official
was not generally competent under municipal law, so that the
acts were completely ultra vires, no imputation of liability
arises. Where an incompetent State agency commits an ultra
vires act, it cannot be said to have acted on behalf of the State.
To quote the Report of a League of Nations Sub-Committee:---

If the act of the official is accomplished outside the scope
of his competence, that is to say, if he has exceeded his powers,
we are then confronted with an act which, judicially speaking,
is not an act of the State. It may be illegal, but from the point
of view of international law, the offence cannot be imputed to
the State".
However, even in these circumstances a State may become
responsible if through the omissions or default of other officials
or organs it has facilitated the commission of the ultra vires
act, or has broken an independent duty of international law,
such as a duty to take steps to restrain the commission of the
wrongful act, or to take measures to prevent the recurrence of
the offence.3 Thus the State may incur an indirect responsibi-
lity arising out of the ultra vires acts. It may possibly also be

liable in such circumstances if it has held out" the incom-
petent agency as having authority (unless there be some con-
stitutional or legal prohibition of the acts of "holding out
relied upon by the claimant State), but even then the "holding
out would still necessitate an imputation to the respondent
State of conduct by some instrumentality other than the
incompetent agency which tortiously acted or omitted to act.

(4) Where the illegal acts are committed by private citizens
and not hy an organ or official of the State the grounds for
not imputing liability to the State are much stronger, for
the doctrine of imputability rests on the assumption that
the delinquency has been committed by an agency at least of the
State concerned. But here again, by their omissions, or default,
the agencies of the State may have broken some independent
duty of international law, and liability may then be imputed to
the State; for example, if it fails in its duty of repression and
punishment of the guilty persons. It is sometimes said that
before a State is liable in this connection, there must be some
implied complicity in the wrongful act either by negligent
failure to prevent the injury, or to investigate the case, or to
punish the guilty offender.
One particular example of damage done by private individuals
has several times come before arbitral tribunals, namely, that
inflicted on the property or persons of aliens in the course of
mob riots. It has been ruled on these occasions that the State
is responsible for the acts of the rioters only if it is guilty of
a breach of good faith or has been negligent in preventing the
riots. If the State reasonably affords adequate protection for
the life and property of aliens, it has fulfilled its duty at
international law towards these persons. To quote the Report
1 Article 13 of the above-mentioned Harvard Draft Convention (p. 303,
n. 1, _ante_), limits the scope of this duty by relation to criminal acts, and
stipulates that the injured alien or some other alien (e.g., a relative) must have
thereby been deprived of the opportunity to recover damages from the de-
linquent; otherwise such inadequacy of efforts of apprehension or prose-
cution are not of themselves grounds of an imputable liability.
* _See_, e.g., the Home Missionary Society Case, Annual Digest of Public
  International Law Cases, 1919--1922, pp. 173--4.

------
Chap. 9.-State Responsibility
307
of the League of Nations Sub-Committee mentioned above :---

Damage suffered by foreigners in case of riot, revolution
or civil war does not involve international responsibility for
the State. In case of riot, however, the State would be
responsible if the riot was directed against foreigners, as such,
and the State failed to perform its duties of surveillance and
repression ".
General Principles as to Protection of Citizens Abroad
The rules of State responsibility under this head depend on
keeping a proper balance between two fundamental rights of
States :---



(i) the right of a State to exercise jurisdiction within its own
territory, free from control by other States;

(ii) the right of a State to protect its citizens abroad.
Most frequently claims are laid on the basis of what is
termed" denial of justice ".2 In a broad sense, the term covers
all injuries inflicted on citizens abroad in violation of inter-
national justice, whether by judicial, legislative or administrative
organs, for example, maltreatment in gaol, or arbitrary con-
fiscation of property; but in its narrow and more technical
sense it connotes misconduct or inaction on the part of the
judicial agencies of the respondent State, denying to the citizens
* of the claimant State the benefits of due process of law. To
  constitute a " denial of justice" in this narrow sense there
  must be some abuse of the judicial process or an improper
  administration of justice, for example, obstructing access to
  the Courts, unwarranted delays in procedure, a manifestly

Part 3.---Rights, etc., of States
General Claims Commission found that a denial of justice had
occurred on Mexico's part, and it cited certain facts in support.
" Irregularity of Court proceedings is proven with reference
to the absence of proper investigations, the insufficiency of
confrontations, withholding from the accused the opportunity
to know all of the charges brought against him, undue delay
of the proceedings, making the hearings in open Court a mere
formality, and a continued absence of seriousness on the part
of the Court'
The Commission also pointed out that the relevant proce-
dure followed (in 1910--1911) was insufficient by international
standards. Similarly, in the Cutting Case, the United States
intervened with Mexico in regard to the trial of an American
citizen who had been arrested on a charge of criminal libel.2
Important in this connection is the matter of exhaustion of
local remedies, particularly where claims for denial of justice
are brought before international tribunals. It appears to be
the rule that no State should intervene or claim in respect of
an alleged denial of justice to a national or other wrong until
all local remedies open to that national have been exhausted
without result. The obvious principle underlying the rule is
that until there has been recourse to the proper final Courts or
authorities of the respondent State it cannot be said that there
has been a denial of justice. Another consideration is that
every opportunity for redress in the municipal sphere should be
sought before the matter assumes the more serious aspect of a
dispute between States.
A detailed consideration of the local remedies rule lies
outside the scope of this book, but certain principles may be
briefly formulated :---

(a) a local remedy is not to be regarded
as adequate and need not be resorted to if the municipal
Courts are not in a position to award compensation or damages;

(b) a claimant is not required to exhaust justice if there is
no justice to exhaust; for example, where the supreme judicial
1 _See above_, pp. 251--252.
2 A mere error in judgment of an international tribunal does not amount to
a denial of justice; _see_ The Salem Case (1932), United Nations Reports of
International Arbitral Awards, Vol. II, at p. 1202.

Chap. 9.-State Responsibility
309
tribunal is under the control of the executive organ responsible
for the illegal act, or where an act of the legislative organ has
caused the injury suffered; (c) where the injury is due to an
executive act of the government as such, which is clearly not
subject to the jurisdiction of the municipal Courts,1 _semble_ the
injured foreign citizens are not required to exhaust local
remedies.
On the other hand, as the Ambatielos Arbitration (1956),
between Greece and Great Britain, shows, local remedies
are not exhausted if an appeal to a higher Court is not
definitely pressed or proceeded with, or if essential evidence
has not been adduced, or if there has been a significant failure
to take some step necessary to succeed in the action.
According to the decision of the International Court of
Justice in the Interhandel (Preliminary Objections) Case, the
local remedies rule applies a fortiori where the national of the
claimant State concerned is actually in the course of litigating
the matter before the municipal Courts of the respondent
State, and the municipal suit is designed to obtain the same
result as in the international proceedings. Moreover, the rule
applies even though the municipal Courts may be called upon
to apply international law in reaching a decision on the matter.
State Responsibility and the Fault Theory!
It is often said that a State is not responsible to another
State for unlawful acts committed by its agents unless such
acts are committed wilfully and maliciously or with culpable
negligence.
It is difficult to accept so wide a conclusion and so invariable
* However, if this is not clearly shown, only the municipal Courts themselves
  can determine the issue of jurisdiction, so that the local remedies rule applies;

Part 3.-Rights, etc., of States
a requirement. A general floating condition of malice or
culpable negligence rather contradicts the scientific and practical
considerations underlying the law as to State responsibility.
Few rules in treaties imposing duties on States contain anything
expressly in terms relating to malice or culpable negligence,
and breaches of those treaties may without more involve the
responsibility of a State party. It is only in specific cases
when particular circumstances demand it that wilfulness or
malice may be necessary to render a State responsible; for
example, if the State knowingly connives in the wrongful acts
of insurgents or rioters, it would become liable, although not
generally otherwise. Moreover, fault can seldom enter into
account in the case of alleged breaches of international law
by legislative or judicial organs, or where the relevant State
agency is acting in the exercise of a statutory discretion, and
there is no evidence of arbitrariness or capriciousness.
Further, the actual decisions of international arbitral
tribunals fail to justify a general condition of malice or
culpable negligence. An instructive precedent is supplied by
the case of the Jessie which came before the British-American
Claims Arbitrai Tribunal in 1921. There the United States
was held responsible to Great Britain for the action of its
officers, although such action was bona fide and in the belief
that it was justified by a joint regulation adopted by the
two countries. The Tribunal laid down the wide principle
that:---

Any government is responsible to other governments for
errors in judgment of its officials purporting to act within the
scope of their duties and vested with power to enforce their
demands"
Thus the Tribunal did not hold that the presence of malice or
culpable negligence was a condition precedent of State
responsibility.
In the field of State responsibility for nuclear activities,
there has to be, subject to the nature of the situations arising
and subject to reasonable general qualifications, some form
of strict or absolute liability. The difficulties here are not to

------
Chap. 9.--State Responsibility
311
be minimised. The safety of the international community can-
not be ensured under a system whereby a State would be
responsible only if it were proved to be negligent in the manage-
ment of nuclear fuels and nuclear installations. This involves
the additional difficulty which in some instances may require
the problem of insurance to be dealt with, of the availability of
sufficient financial resources to meet large-scale liabilities for
major damage.
The unavoidable dangers involved in nuclear activities,
particularly those related to the use of, and experiments with,
nuclear weapons, together with the increase in the number of
non-nuclear-weapon States engaged in the development of
nuclear energy, partly explain the signature on July 1, 1968,
of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
The dangers inherent in the nuclear arms race also materially
influenced the conclusion of the Treaty. The two key pro-
visions are contained in Articles I and II. Article I provides
that each nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty is not to
transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons or other
nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or
explosive devices directly, or indirectly, and also is not to
assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear-weapon State
to manufacture or acquire or control such weapons or devices.
Article II obliges each non-nuclear-weapon State party to the
Treaty not to receive the transfer from any transferor whatso-
ever of nuclear weapons or devices, directly or indirectly; and
not to manufacture or acquire these, or to seek or receive
assistance in their manufacture. Under Article IV, the right of
all parties, subject to Articles I and II, to use nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes is preserved, while non-nuclear-weapon
States parties are through agreements negotiated with the

Article III, to accept the safeguards system evolved by that

The Treaty is a compromise, and possibly does not represent
an ideal solution, but without it nuclear proliferation would
have been removed from the major controls established under
its provisions.
4.-CLAIMS
Inasmuch as a State has a right to protect its citizens abroad,
it is entitled to intervene diplomatically or to lodge a claim for
satisfaction before an international arbitral tribunal if one of
its subjects has sustained unlawful injury for which another
State is responsible. The claimant State is deemed to be
injured through its subjects, or to be asserting its right to ensure
respect for the rules of international law vis-à-vis its own
nationals," and once the intervention is made or the claim is
laid, the matter becomes one that concerns the two States
alone. The injured subject's only right is to claim through his
State as against the State responsible. Some writers indeed
hold the view that if the injured subject waives his rights of
compensation, his State can none the less prosecute a claim for
the injury done to him.
Sometimes it is expressed that this right corresponds to an
administrative duty of the State towards such of its nationals
as have suffered injury. But State practice (for example, of
the Department of State of the United States) shows that most
States regard the sponsoring of claims by nationals as entirely
within their discretion. Whether or not protection be a
right or a duty of the State, it is now well established that in
the international forum, as a rule, the only recognised claimants
* This is a truly international system, involving both reporting and inspec-
  tion. Prior to the Treaty, a large number of countries were subject to the
  system; _see_ the address, September 21, 1966, by the Director-General of

  International Law, Vol. 60 (1966), pp. 34--54.

are States. To quote the Permanent Court of International
Justicel :
"Once a State has taken up a case on behalf of one of its
subjects before an international tribunal, in the eyes of the
latter the State is the sole claimant".
It follows from the general principle that once compensation
has been assessed and paid by the defendant State to the
claimant State, the defendant State, apart from express contract,
is not interested in nor entitled to concern itself with the manner
in which the complainant State disposes of the sum of money
awarded. The complainant State need not in fact remit to its
injured citizen the whole of the compensation received by it.
The persons on behalf of whom a State is entitled to
propound an international claim are primarily its nationals,
but may include also "protected " subjects such as those
placed under that State's diplomatic protection, and even
aliens who have complied with almost all the conditions of
naturalisation. In the majority of cases, international arbitral
tribunals have applied the rule that the injured person must
have the nationality of the claimant State or other recognised
status at the time the injury was suffered and must retain it
until the claim is decided (or at least until the claim is presented),
but other requirements and refinements in connection with the
nationality of the injured party have also been adopted by
different arbitrators. The necessity for the rule was expressed
by the United States-Germany Mixed Claims Commission as
follows?:---

The reason of the rule is that the nation is injured through
injury to its national and it alone may demand reparation as no
other national is injured. As between nations the one inflicting
the injury will ordinarily listen to the complaint only of the nation
injured. . . Any other rule would open wide the door for
abuses and might result in converting a strong nation into a
claim agency on behalf of those who after suffering injuries

Part 3.---Rights, etc., of States
should assign their claims to its nationals or avail themselves
of its naturalisation laws for the purpose of procuring its
espousal of their claims ".
Where the party injured is a company or corporation, the
matter is likewise governed by the "nationality of claims "
canon. Only the national State is entitled to espouse the
claim of the company or corporation, the nationality of which
is determined by tests referred to in Chapter 11, _post._ Diffi-
culties may arise however in the case of the so-called " triang-
ular "situation, namely: (a) Injury in breach of international law
is done to a company incorporated and with its registered
office in State A. (b) The act occasioning the injury has been
committed by State B, where the company has carried on its
operations. (c) The principal shareholders of the company
are nationals of, and resident in State C. Is State C entitled
to espouse the claims of the shareholders who have incurred loss
through the act of State B?
The principles governing such a situation were clarified in
1970 by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona
Traction Case (Belgium-Spain), where the Court ruled in
favour of the respondent State, Spain, upon the antecedent
ground that Belgium had no locus standi to espouse before the
Court claims of alleged Belgian nationals who were shareholders
in the subject company, Barcelona Traction, Light and Power
Company, Limited, inasmuch as the latter was incorporated in
Canada and was, in an international legal sense, of Canadian
nationality. The reasoning relied upon by the Court may be
expressed as follows:---

(a) International law was bound to have
regard to the general tenor of rules of national legal systems,
which was to the effect that an infringement of a company's
rights by outsiders did not involve liability towards the share-
holders, even if their interests were detrimentally affected by
the infringement. Consistently, therefore, the general rule
of international law was that the national State of the com-
pany concerned was entitled to exercise diplomatic protection
1 _See_ p. 343.

(Second Phase), I.C.J. Reports, 1970, p. 3.

------
Chap. 9.-State Responsibility
315
for the purpose of seeking redress for an international wrong
done to the company. (b) A different principle might apply if
the wrong were aimed at the direct rights of the shareholders as
such (e.g., the right to attend and vote at general meetings),
but in the instant case, Belgium had conceded that its claim was
not based upon any infringement of the direct rights of share-
holders, but only upon the alleged illegal measures taken in
Spain against the company. (c) The general rule of the
exclusive entitlement of the national State of the company might
conceivably, in certain cases, give way to the right of the national
State of the shareholders, for example where the company itself
had ceased to exist, or the protecting national State of the
company lacked capacity to exercise diplomatic protection;
however, in the instant case the Barcelona Traction, Light
and Power Company, Limited had not ceased to exist as a
corporate entity in Canada, nor was the Canadian Govern-
ment incapable of exercising diplomatic protection, although
for reasons of its own, its interposition on behalf of the com-
pany
had ceased as from 1955.
The Court did not accept certain propositions, namely:---


(i)
If investments formed part of a country's national economic
resources, and these were prejudicially affected contrary to
that country's right to have its nationals enjoy a certain standard
of treatment, it could claim for breach of international law done
to it. A claim of this nature would have to be based on treaty or
special agreement, which did not exist between Belgium and
Spain. (ii) For reasons of equity, a country should be entitled
in certain cases to take up the protection of its nationals who
were shareholders in a company, the victim of a breach of
international law. Any such alleged equitable justification
would open the door to competing claims on the part of
different States, thereby creating insecurity in international
economic relations. 1
1 In its judgment (_see_ paragraph 99) the Court referred to the case of a
company established in a foreign country in order to obtain tax or other
advantages, and said that it did not seem " to be in any way inequitable " that
these advantages should be balanced by the risk that a State other than the
national State of shareholders would be solely entitled to exercise diplomatic
protection.

------
316
Part 3.---Rights, etc., of States
The net effect of the Court's decision is then that an inter-
national Court ought to be reluctant to pierce the corporate
veil" in order to allow a country other than the national State
of the company to seek redress for an international wrong
done to the company.
According to the decision of the International Court of
Justice in the Nottebohm Case (Second Phase)," where the per-
son, whose claim is being propounded by the claimant State,
is a national of it by naturalisation, the claimant State will
not be entitled to proceed, if such person has no close and
genuine connection with that State, sufficient for the grant of
its nationality. A somewhat similar principle applies if he is
of dual nationality; his " real and effective nationality" must
be that of the claimant State.2
In the I'm Alone Case3 between Canada and the United
States, the Canadian Government was held entitled to claim
although only the nominal or _de jure_ owner of the vessel-
the I'm Alone---was of Canadian nationality, the real or
_de facto_ owners being actually Americans. Counsel for the
United States urged that the damages awarded would ultimately
go into the pockets of American citizens, but this was treated
as an irrelevant consideration.
This doctrine of "nationality of claims " has with some
justification been condemned as artificial, and the theory that
a claimant State is injured through its subjects has been
described as a pure fiction, but they are both supported by the
weight of State practice and arbitral decision.
It remains to point out that States may by treaty lay down
special principles or provide for a special procedure _inter partes_
for claims in respect of disputes, or for tortious injuries received
1 _See_ I.C.J. Reports (1955) 4.
2 _Cf._ Florence Strunsky Mergé Case (1955), American Journal of International
Law (1956), Vol. 50, p. 154.
* _See_ United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. III,
  p. 1609. This case arose out of the sinking in 1929 of the I'm Alone, a British
  schooner of Canadian registry, by a United States coastguard vessel at a
  point on the high seas more than 200 miles from the United States coast.
  The I'm Alone was engaged in the smuggling of alcoholic liquor into the
  United States, but the Canadian Government claimed that the sinking was
  illegal and not justified by any Convention with the United States.

by their citizens. In that connection, reference may be made
to article 25 of the Convention of March 18, 1965, on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals
of Other States, enabling private investors who are nationals
of a State party to settle investment disputes with the Govern-
ment of another State party. In the case of a private investor,
who is a natural person, he is to have the nationality of the
State concerned on the date of the consent of the parties to
submit the dispute to settlement and on the date of the registra-
tion of the relevant request for settlement by arbitration or
conciliation; but a person who on either date possessed the
nationality of the investment-receiving State is ineligible to
use the machinery of the Convention, even if the investment-
receiving State consented to access being given. However, in
the case of a private investor who is a body corporate or other
entity, the position is not so rigid; not only is access allowed to
corporations, etc., which had the nationality of a State party
other than the investment-receiving State on the date of the
consent to submit, but also to those who on that date held the
nationality of the investment-receiving State, provided that
the latter State agrees to treat the claimant as the national of
another State, because of foreign control. This is a radical
advance, enabling regard to be had to the realities of control of
corporations and companies.
Damages
Under international law, in matters of State responsibility,
a claimant State is always entitled to some damages where
its claim has been sustained, irrespective of whether the
wrongful act subject of the claim has caused material damage,
or injury, or pecuniary loss. Further, if the wrongful act be
an infringement, contrary to international law, of the rights
of a private citizen whose claim has been espoused by that
State, the damage deemed to have been suffered by the claimant
_See_, e.g. Article VIII of the Agreement of the North Atlantic Powers of
June 19, 1951, regarding the Status of their Forces (claims in respect to acts or
omissions of members of the forces or civilian components), and _cf._ the claims
provisions in the stationing of forces agreements concluded by the Soviet
Union.

------
318
Part 3.---Rights, etc., of States
State is an independent damage not identical with that suffered
by the individual. To quote the Permanent Court of Inter-
national Justice in the Chorzów Factory (Indemnity) Casel:---

" The damage suffered by an individual is never
identical in kind with that which will be suffered by a State;
it can only afford a convenient scale for the calculation of the
reparation due to the State".
This principle is consistent with the award in the Lusitania
Death Claims, arising out of the sinking of the British vessel,
the Lusitania, by a German submarine in 1915. The United
States-Germany Mixed Claims Commission, in claims by the
United States on behalf of American citizens drowned when
the vessel sank, refused to grant vindictive or exemplary
damages? against the German Government. On the other
hand, such damages appear to have been awarded by the
United States Mexico General Claims Commission in the
Janes Case (1926), where the claim was lodged by the United
States in regard to the failure of the Mexican authorities to
take prompt and effective action to apprehend the murderer of
an American citizen. The Commission awarded damages for
the "indignity done to the relatives of the victim by the
murderer's non-punishment.
In several instances, international arbitral tribunals have
awarded two separate heads of damage, one in respect of the
damage suffered by individuals, and the other in respect of
injury to the claimant State. Such an award was made in the
I'm Alone Case (p. 316), and is consistent with the views
expressed by the International Court of Justice that the United
Nations can claim compensation both in respect of itself and of
1 Pub. P.C.I.J. (1928), Series A, No. 17, at p. 28.

  in respect of acts committed maliciously or with gross negligence or in other
  circumstances of aggravation.

the damage to individuals arising out of injuries suffered by its
officials in the course of their duties.1
In practice, however, most States limit their claims to the loss
actually suffered by the individual, and such loss is also usually
the measure of the arbitral tribunal's award, irrespective of the
degree of blame attachable to the delinquent or respondent
State.

necessary to make restitution, together with special damages for loss not covered
by such restitution. The International Court of Justice awarded to Great Britain

for which Albania was held liable; _see_ the Corfu Channel (Assessment) Case
