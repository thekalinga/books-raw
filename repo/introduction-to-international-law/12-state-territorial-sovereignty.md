CHAPTER 7
STATE TERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY AND OTHER
LESSER RIGHTS OF STATES
1.--TERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY AND OTHER LESSER RIGHTS
As we have seen, one of the essential elements of statehood
is the occupation of a territorial area, within which State law
operates. Over this area, supreme authority is vested in
the State.
Hence there arises the concept of " Territorial Sovereignty"
which signifies that within this territorial domain jurisdiction
is exercised by the State over persons and property to the
exclusion of other States. This concept bears some resem-
blance to the patrimonial notions of ownership under private
law, and in fact the early writers on international law adopted
many of the civil law principles of property in their treatment
of State territorial sovereignty. To this day, their influence
has persisted so that in particular the rules as to acquisition
and loss of territorial sovereignty plainly reflect the influences
of the civil law, but it is manifest that there are certain dangers
in having recourse to Roman law and civil law analogies.
However, it may be that in certain areas of the subject there is
room for a wider application of the uti possidetis principle ("' as
you possess, you shall continue to possess ").1
Territorial sovereignty was described by the learned Max
Huber, Arbitrator in the Island of Palmas Arbitration, in these
terms:---

Sovereignty in the relation between States signifies in-
dependence. Independence in regard to a portion of the globe
is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other
State, the functions of a State".
It is sometimes said that territorial sovereignty is indivisible,
but there have been numerous instances in international

practice both of division of sovereignty, and of distribution
of the components of sovereignty.
For instance, sovereignty is often shared jointly by two or
more Powers as in the case of a condominium.1 Moreover,
leases or pledges of a territory are frequently made by one
State to another, as for example the leases of Chinese territory
to Russia, France, Germany, and Great Britain at the end
of the last century during the so-called " Battle of the Con-
cessions" between these Great Powers, and the leases of
British bases in the West Atlantic to the United States in
1940 in exchange for fifty American destroyers which were
urgently needed in the war against Germany. In the case of
a lease, temporary sovereignty is exercised by the lessee State,
while the lessor State possesses a sovereignty in reversion.
Again, sometimes sovereignty over a territory is held by one
or more Powers in trust for the population of the territory
concerned, as for example in the pre-war case of the League of
Nations control over the Saar before its return to Germany in
1935. Thus, international law does not appear to restrict the
      manner in which the sovereignty as to particular territory can
      be bestowed on, or withdrawn from any State.
      Acquisition of Territorial Sovereignty
      The five traditional and generally recognised modes of
      acquiring territorial sovereignty are:---
-Occupation, annexation,
      accretion, prescription, and cession. These modes are directly
      analogous to the civil law methods of acquiring private owner-
      ship.
      As was pointed out in the Island of Palmas Arbitration,
      these modes reduce essentially to the display of effective
      control and authority either by the State claiming sovereignty,
      or by a State from which the State claiming sovereignty can
      prove that title has been derived.3 Thus occupation and
      annexation are based on an act of " effective apprehension'

      for discussion of the extent to which effectiveness governs the operation of
      these modes of acquiring title.

of the territory, while accretion can only be conceived of as
an addition to a portion of territory where there already exists
an actual sovereignty. Prescription depends on the continuous
and peaceful display of sovereignty over territory for a long
period, while cession presupposes that the ceding State has
the power of effectively disposing of the ceded territory. It is
claimed by some writers, notably Kelsen, that cession _per se_
does not operate to transfer territorial sovereignty until the
receiving State has effectively established its authority over the
ceded territory
One additional mode of acquisition of territorial sovereignty,
not included above, should be mentioned, namely adjudication
or award by a Conference of States. This usually occurs where
a Conference of the victorious Powers at the end of a War
assigns territory to a particular State in view of a general peace
settlement; for example, the territorial redistribution of Europe
at the Versailles Peace Conference, 1919. According to
Soviet doctrine, territorial sovereignty may also be acquired by
plebiscite, although this would appear to be less a mode of
acquisition than a step preceding it.
Certain instances in the past of territorial sovereignty accruing
to a State cannot readily be fitted into one or other of these
traditional, generally accepted modes of acquisition. Such
special cases have included, and may include the following:---


(a) territory accruing to a State by reason of a boundary delimi-
tation effected by a mixed demarcation commission, or under
an award ex aequo et bono by an arbitral tribunal settling a
boundary dispute; (b) the grant of territorial rights to a State
under a treaty between it and some indigenous tribe or com-
munity, previously in sole and exclusive occupation of the area
concerned; (c) long, continuous recognition by other States
of a State's territorial sovereignty, notwithstanding obscurity
or ambiguity surrounding the inception of that State's claim to
title; (d) succession by a new State to the territory of its prede-
cessor; (e) territory distributed as the result of a treaty of
compromise or settlement in respect to disputed tracts of land
As to (e), the present writer would indeed favour a general head
of acquisition under the provisions of a treaty, in the same way

as the draftsmen of the Code Napoléon (1803) admitted the
acquisition of property as the result of obligations (_see_ Book
III, General Provisions, Article 711).
The modes-of-acquisition approach to the creation and
transfer of territorial sovereignty is both sound in principle
and of practical value, provided that care is taken, in using this
approach, not to confuse the mode itself with its component
elements or ingredients (e.g., in the case of the mode known as
occupation", the element of display of authority is an
ingredient of, but not itself a mode of acquisition of territorial
sovereignty).
Occupation
Occupation consists in establishing sovereignty over territory
not under the authority of any other State whether newly
discovered, or---an unlikely case---abandoned by the State
formerly in control.
In determining whether or not an occupation has taken
place in accordance with international law, the principle of
effectiveness is applied for the most part. In the Eastern
Greenland Case, the Permanent Court of International Justice
laid it down that occupation, to be effective, requires on the
part of the appropriating State two elements:---


(i) an intention
or will to act as sovereign; (ii) the adequate exercise or display
of sovereignty. In the case mentioned, title to Eastern Green-
land was disputed by Norway and Denmark, and Denmark
was able to prove circumstances which established these two
elements on its part.
The element of intention is a matter of inference from all
the facts, although sometimes such intention may be formally
expressed in official notifications to other interested Powers.
There must be evidence of nothing less than a permanent
intention to assume control; a mere transient passage by the
alleged occupying Power is by itself insufficient to satisfy this
test. Nor are the independent, unauthorised activities of
private individuals, without subsequent ratification, valid for this
Pub. P.C.I.J. (1933), Series A/B, No. 53.

Part 2.--States as Subjects of International Law
purpose. Hence, discovery alone has been regarded by
writers as conferring an "inchoate" title only, unless such
discovery be consummated by some more significant acts or
activity. As regards the second requirement of exercise or
display of sovereignty, this may be satisfied by concrete evidence
of possession or control, or according to the nature of the case,
a physical assumption of sovereignty may be manifested by
an overt or symbolic act? or by legislative or executive measures
affecting the territory claimed, or by treaties with other States
recognising the claimant State's sovereignty, by fixing of
boundaries, and so on. The degree of authority necessary for
this purpose will vary according to the circumstances; thus,
a relatively backward territory does not require the same
elaborate control and government as one more developed
and civilised.
In the Minquiers and Ecrehos Case, 3 relating to disputed
British and French claims to certain Channel islets, the Inter-
national Court of Justice stressed the importance of actual
exercise of " State functions ", e.g., local administration, local
jurisdiction, and acts of legislative authority, as proving the
continuous display of sovereignty necessary to confirm title.
For this reason, upon the evidence as to long continued exercise
of State functions by British authorities, the Court preferred
the claim of Great Britain.
An act of occupation more frequently than not involves in
the first instance an act of discovery. It now follows from
the Island of Palmas Arbitration, _supra_, decided by M. Huber as
Arbitrator, that a mere act of discovery by one State without
not sufficient to confer a title by occupation, and
that such incomplete appropriation must give way to a
continuous and peaceful display of authority by another State.
In this arbitration, the contest of title lay between the United

national Law (1970), pp. 132--133.
? _See_ the Clipperton Island Arbitration (1931), American Journal of Inter-
national Law (1932), Vol. 26, 390. As this Arbitration shows, an actual
manifestation of sovereignty on the locus of the territory creates a stronger title
than a historic claim of right, unsupported by such a concrete act.

States, claiming as successor to Spain which had originally
discovered the island disputed, and the Netherlands, which
according to the historical evidence submitted to the Arbitrator,
had for a very long period purported to act as sovereign over
the island. The Arbitrator adjudged the island to the Nether-
lands, and in giving the reasons for his award laid supreme
emphasis on the fact that long continuous exercise of effective
authority can confer title at international law.
It may be important to determine what extent of territory is
embraced by an act of occupation. Various theories on this
point have been held from time to time, and two such theories
have assumed particular significance in connection with the
claims of certain States in polar regions, namely:---

(1) The
theory of continuity, whereby an act of occupation in a par-
ticular area extends the sovereignty of the occupying State so
far as is necessary for the security or natural development of
the area of lodgment. (2) The theory of contiguity, whereby
the sovereignty of the occupying State reaches to those neigh-
bouring territories which are geographically pertinent to the
area of lodgment.2
Both theories are to some extent reflected in the claims
made by States to polar areas according to the sector principle.3
By claims based on this principle, certain States with territory
bordering on the polar regions have asserted a sovereign title
to land or frozen sea within a sector defined by the coastline
of this territory and by meridians of longitude intersecting
at the North or South Pole as the case may be. These claims
66
* For discussion of the theories, _see_ Westlake, International Law (2nd
  Edition, 1910), Vol. I, pp. 113 _et seq._
  2 The theory of contiguity was rejected by Arbitrator Huber in the Island
  of Palmas Arbitration, p. 176, _ante_; he declared it to be wholly lacking in
  precision": In the North Sea Continental Shelf Cases, I.C.J. Reports (1969),
  3 at pp. 30--31, the International Court of Justice preferred the theory of
  continuity to that of adjacency or proximity (i.e., contiguity) as an explanation
  of the coastal State's rights in regard to the continental shelf; _see also_
  pp. 224--225, _post._
  3 The sector claims of Chile and Argentina in the Antarctic are based
  primarily on contiguity; _see_ Greig, International Law (1970), p. 140. For a
  map of the Antarctic sector claims, _see_ London Times, January 18, 1955.

have been pressed both in the Arctic (by the Soviet Union and
Canada, for example) and in the Antarctic (by Argentina,
Australia, Great Britain, Chile, France, New Zealand, and
Norway). The principal justification for sector claims is the
inapplicability to polar regions, with their inaccessibility,
climatic conditions, and lack of settlement, of the normal
principles of physical assumption of control implicit in the
international law of occupation. Also the view has been
advanced that the sectors themselves correspond to a just and
equitable division. On the other hand, it is fairly arguable that
the sector claims rest on no stronger basis than the mutual
acquiescence of the claimant States. In effect, they amount to
no more than notifications of future intention to assume full
control, something akin to designations of spheres of influence
or interest. Significantly, sector States have sought to fortify
their title by the ordinary methods of administrative control,
State activity, etc., traditionally employed by States desiring
to acquire title by occupation. Other criticisms of sector
claims are fairly and justly directed to the arbitrary character
of the sector lines, and to the fact that these lines lie across
large areas of the open sea.
One point is clear. The practice of a limited number of
States in making sector claims has not created a customary
rule that such a method of acquiring polar territory is ad-
missible in international law. Here, it is only necessary to
mention the reservations of non-sector States and doubts
of jurists on the validity of sector claims, and the widely
held view that polar areas should be subject to an inter-
national regime. Reference may be made in this connec-
tion to the Treaty on Antarctica signed at Washington on
December 1, 1959, by the seven Antarctic sector States and
1 The British sector claim conflicts with the Argentinian and Chilean claims,
which themselves overlap.
2 These factors may be overcome by new technical developments in the field
of aviation. Already, aviation has made it possible to supply winter bases in
polar regions. In addition, "great circle" air routes across the Arctic have
be pioneered and are regular use. Apart from aviation, there is the
possibility that the inaccessibility of polar regions may be reduced through the
use of nuclear submarines. On July 31, 1962, two United States nuclear sub-
marines met at the North Pole.

Belgium, Japan, South Africa, the Soviet Union, and the United
States. This Treaty provides, inter alia, that Antarctica should
be used for peaceful purposes only, that there should be free-
dom of scientific investigation there, that the parties should
exchange information regarding Antarctic scientific programmes,
that nuclear explosions and the disposal of radioactive wastes
in Antarctica should be prohibited, and that all areas in
Antarctica should be freely available for inspection by observers
of the contracting States. It is, however, expressly provided
in Article IV of the Treaty that nothing therein is to be inter-
preted as a renunciation of claims or of any basis of claim
in Antarctica, and that no acts or activities taking place while
the Treaty is in force are to serve as a basis for asserting, sup-
porting, or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarc-
tica, or create any rights of sovereignty there, while no new
claim or enlargement of an existing claim is to be asserted. The
result is that, during the currency of the Treaty, Antarctic
sector claims are "frozen", and the status quo of Antarctic
non-sector bases of claim is preserved.
In order to further the principles and objectives of the Antarc-
tic Treaty, six Consultative Meetings of the parties were held
respectively at Canberra in 1961, Buenos Aires in 1962, Brus-
sels in 1964, Santiago in 1966, Paris in 1968, and Tokyo in
1970.1 The Brussels Meeting was especially notable for the
adoption of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of
Antarctic Fauna and Flora, Article VIII of which provided for
the zoning of "Specially Protected Areas". A number of
such areas have since been designated. At the Tokyo Con-
sultative Meeting in 1970, two important Recommendations
were adopted, one relating to man's impact on the Antarctic
environment, which provided for research in the matter and for
interim measures to reduce harmful environmental interference,
and the other for exchange of information concerning launchings
of scientific research rockets in the Treaty Area.

Part 2.-States as Subjects of International Law
Annexation
Annexation' is a method of acquiring territorial sovereignty
which is resorted to in two sets of circumstances:---

(a) Where
the territory annexed has been conquered or subjugated by the
annexing State. (b) Where the territory annexed is in a position
of virtual subordination to the annexing State at the time the
latter's intention of annexation is declared. Case (a) is the
more usual, but there have been modern instances of case (b),
as, for example, the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910,
Korea having then been under Japanese domination for some
years. Conquest of a territory as under (a) is not sufficient to
constitute acquisition of title; there must be, in addition, a
formally declared intention to annex, which is usually expressed
in a Note or Notes sent to all other interested Powers. It
follows that sovereignty is not acquired by victorious States
over the territory of a vanquished State, if they expressly
disclaim an intention to annex it.2 An annexation which
results from gross aggression committed by one State against
another, or which has been effected by force contrary to the
provisions of the United Nations Charter, ought not, _semble_,
to be recognised by other States.3
Accretion
Title by accretion occurs where new territory is added,
mainly through natural causes, to territory already under the
sovereignty of the acquiring State. No formal act or assertion
1 Distinguish the so-called " peaceful annexation", i.e., the taking over of
territory in the name of a State, by proclamation followed by settlement,
without the use of force to conquer the territory. Such" peaceful annexation
is in effect an ingredient of the method of acquisition by occupation. _Cf._ the
use of the expression " peaceful annexation" in Cooper v. Stuart (1889),
14 App. Cas. 286, P.C., at p. 291, with reference to the colonisation of Austra-
lia.
2 _Cf._ the case of such a disclaimer by the Allied Powers in 1945 in respect
to Germany after the unconditional surrender by the German Government.
According to Judge Jessup in The South West Africa Cases, 2nd Phase, I.C.J.
Reports, 1966, 6, at pp. 418--419: "It is commonplace that international
law does not recognise military conquest as a source of title ".

of title is necessary. It is immaterial whether the process of
accretion has been gradual or imperceptible, as in the normal
case of alluvial deposits or alluvial formation of islands, or
whether it has been produced by a sudden and abrupt transfer
of soil, provided that this has become embedded, and was not
in any event identifiable as originating from another location.i
The rules of Roman private law regarding the division of
ownership over alluvial deposits in streams or rivers between
the riparian owners are by analogy applicable to the problem
of apportioning sovereignty between riparian States where
similar deposits occur in boundary rivers.
Cession
Cession is an important method of acquiring territorial
sovereignty. It rests on the principle that the right of trans-
ferring its territory is a fundamental attribute of the sovereignty
of a State.
The cession of a territory may be voluntary, or it may be
made under compulsion as a result of a war conducted success-
fully by the State to which the territory is to be ceded. As a
matter of fact, a cession of territory following defeat in war is
more usual than annexation. As examples of voluntary
cession may be cited the sale of Alaska by Russia to the United
States in 1867, and the exchange of Heligoland for Zanzibar
by Germany and Great Britain in 1890. Compulsory cession
is illustrated by the cession to Germany by France in 1871 of
Alsace-Lorraine-subsequently returned to France at the end
of the First World War.
Any transaction (such as a gift, sale, or exchange) will be
valid as a cession which sufficiently indicates an intention to
transfer sovereignty from one State to another.
A ceding State cannot derogate from its own grant. Hence,
it is, that there necessarily pass under a cession of territory all
sovereign rights pertaining to the territory ceded.
1 _See_ Shalowitz, Shore and Sea Boundaries, Vol. II (1964), at pp. 537--539, as
to the different meanings of accretion, alluvion, reliction, erosion, and
avulsion.

182
Part 2.-States as Subjects of International Law
Prescription
Title by prescription (i.e., acquisitive prescription) is the
result of the peaceable exercise of _de facto_ sovereignty for a
very long period over territory subject to the sovereignty of
another. A number of jurists (including Rivier and de Martens)
have denied that acquisitive prescription is recognised by
international law. There is no decision of any international
tribunal which conclusively supports any doctrine of acquisitive
prescription, although it has been claimed that the Island of
Palmas Case (p. 176), represents such a precedent. Nor is
there any recognised principle of international law fixing in
terms of years the period of time that will constitute a good
root of title. As a practical matter it is also difficult to conceive
of any case in which the lawful sovereignty of a State over
territory would give way before possession and control by
another. Indeed, it has never been accepted that the mere
silence of a State with regard to territory claimed to belong to
it could result in the divesting of its claim by anything less
than the indicia of an effective occupation. In the Frontier
Lands Case (Belgium-Netherlands), it was held by the Inter-
national Court of Justice that mere routine and administrative
acts performed by local Netherlands officials in a certain area
could not displace the legal title of Belgium to that area under
a duly concluded Convention.
On the other hand, it is true that if territory formerly belong-
ing to State A is to be acquired by another entity or State,
there is no requirement at international law that State A must

the acquisition of sovereignty over terra nullius.

doctrine of acquisitive prescription.

the Temple of Preah Vihear (Merits) (Cambodia- Thailand) I.C.J. Reports
(1962), 6, the Court declined to treat the acts of merely local administrative
authorities in a certain disputed area, as negativing a consistent attitude of the
central authorities of Thailand, accepting as valid a certain frontier line, which
placed the area under the sovereignty of Cambodia.

evince an animus disponendi. If prescription is to be regarded
as a good root of international legal title, the critical points
are the length of the period of public and peaceful exercise of
_de facto_ sovereignty, whether this has remained uninterrupted,
and the strength of the title displaced. The adequacy of length
of the period would have to be decided by an international
tribunal; and there should be caution in applying analogies
from Roman law, or other systems of domestic law.
Acquisition of Territorial Sovereignty by Newly Emerged
States
The acquisition of territorial sovereignty by newly emerged
states, such as " decolonised" dependencies or emancipated
trust territories appears to be _sui generis_. The theoretical
dilemma here is that territory is one of the components of state-
hood, yet until the new State comes into being, in principle,
there is no entity capable of taking title. In the writer's
view, this abstract difficulty can be resolved by treating the
people of the territory, as such, provided they have a sufficient
degree of political maturity, as having or acquiring sovereignty
pending the attainment of statehood.1 Upon the foundation
of the new State, there is simply a crystallisation of the situation,
the territorial sovereignty of the people then becoming that of
the State itself.
This view as to the acquisition of territory by newly emerged
States is consistent with the principle proclaimed in the
Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning
Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Ac-
cordance with the United Nations, adopted by the General
Assembly in 1970, namely, that the territory of a colony or
non-self-governing territory has under the Charter "a status

Justice on the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of

Mandated Territory of South West Africa as having a right of progress
towards independence, which had been violated by South Africa's failure as
Mandatory Power to comply with its obligation to submit to the supervision
of United Nations organs. The Court referred to the people as a "jural
entity"; _see_ I.C.J. Reports, 1971, 16, at p. 56.

184 Part 2.--States as Subjects of International Law
separate and distinct from the territory of the State adminis-
tering it ", which subsists until the people concerned has
exercised its right of self-determination.
Loss of Territorial Sovereignty
To the modes of acquiring sovereignty over territory just
considered, there correspond exactly similar methods of losing
it. Thus territorial sovereignty can be lost by dereliction
(corresponding to occupation on the acquisitive side), by
conquest, by operations of nature (corresponding to accretion
on the acquisitive side), and by prescription. There is, how-
ever, one method of losing territory which does not correspond
to any mode of acquiring it, namely, revolt followed by
secession of a part of the territory of the State concerned.
Sovereignty over the Air Space
The development of aviation as from the early years of the
present century immediately raised problems as to the
sovereignty of States over their superjacent air space.
Before the First World War (1914--1918) the only point on
which there was universal agreement was that the air space
over the open sea and over unappropriated territory was
absolutely free and open. In regard to the air space over
occupied territory and over waters subject to State sovereignty,
there were a number of different theories, but upon the out-
break of the First World War in 1914, it was found, as a matter
of practical exigency, that the only one commanding acceptance
by all States was the theory of sovereignty of the subjacent
State over the air space to an unlimited height, i.e. usque ad
coelum. This was adopted and enforced not merely by the
belligerents, but also by neutral States. It was confirmed in
Article 1 of the Paris Convention of 1919 for the Regulation of
Aerial Navigation, whereby the parties recognised that every
State has "complete and exclusive sovereignty" over the air
space above its territory and territorial waters. As we shall
1 These included, in addition to the usque ad coelum theory, the following:---


(a) complete freedom of the air space; (b) sovereignty of the subjacent State
up to a specific height, the remaining air space being free; (c) sovereignty of
the subjacent State up to a specific height, that State having a right to regulate
the passage of aircraft through the remaining air space.

------
Chap. 7.-State Territorial Sovereignty 185
_see below_, this usque ad coelum principle has been affected by
recent developments in the upper strata of the atmosphere and
in outer space.
The Paris Convention contained elaborate provisions for the
international regulation of air navigation, partly with the object
of establishing uniformity. It established the distinction, which
is still currently maintained between:---

(a) scheduled inter-
national airlines or air services (described in Article 15 as
"regular international air navigation lines" and " international
airways "); and (b) aircraft not belonging to such scheduled
airlines or air services. The latter aircraft, provided that they
were of parties to the Convention, were to have " freedom of
innocent passage
through the air space of other parties,
subject to their observance of the conditions laid down in the
Convention (Article 2). The former, however, were to have
no right of operating, with or without landing, except with the
prior authorisation of the States flown over (Article 15). The
Convention and its annexed Regulations provided also for the
registration of aircraft, for certificates of airworthiness, for
aircrew licences, for rules of traffic near aerodromes, etc. The
Convention did not apply to certain American States, including
the United States, but these became party to the Havana Con-
vention of 1928 on Commercial Aviation, containing sub-
stantially similar provisions, although differing from the former
instrument in being primarily a commercial agreement and in
containing no annexed technical regulations.
In general, prior to the Second World War, landing rights for
foreign aircraft remained within the discretion of the State
concerned.
The prodigious increase in trans-continental and inter-
oceanic aviation, following on technical developments both
before and during the Second World War, raised new problems
as to freedom of air transit and landing rights for international
airlines. States operating regular international airlines which
did not possess convenient air-strips in other parts of the world

naturally clamoured for such rights as against States which
did have these landing grounds. Also, as between States which
desired to maintain their own scheduled air services, even to
distant countries, problems arose of the allocation of air
traffic. These and allied questions formed the subject of an
International Civil Aviation Conference which met at Chicago in
November, 1944. The object of this Conference at which over
forty States were represented was to conclude world-wide
arrangements governing commercial air traffic rights as well as
technical and navigational matters relating to international
aviation. The main discussions were concerned with obtaining
agreement by all States to the concession of the " Five Free-
doms of the Air ", namely, the rights of the airlines of each
State to:

(1) fly across foreign territory without landing;

(2) land for non-traffic purposes;

(3) disembark in a foreign country traffic originating in
the State of origin of the aircraft;

(4) pick up in a foreign country traffic destined for the
State of origin of the aircraft;

(5) carry traffic between two foreign countries.
The proposal of the "Five Freedoms " was fostered by the
United States, the most powerful operator State, but no
unanimous enthusiasm was shown at the Conference for
making these part of the law of nations. Only the first two
" Freedoms" appeared to obtain the support of a majority
of the States represented. Accordingly, the Conference was
constrained to draw up two Agreements:---

(a) The Inter-
national Air Services Transit Agreement providing for the
first two "Freedoms ", namely, flying without landing, and
landing rights for non-traffic purposes in foreign territory.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a State party
might designate the route to be followed within its territory,
and the airports which could be used. (b) The International
Air Transport Agreement embodying all " Five Freedoms ".
States parties to this Agreement might refuse to the aircraft of
other States access to the internal air traffic within their

territory. The majority of the States represented at the
Conference signed the first Agreement, but less than half
signed the second, and a few States abstained from signing
either. It is clear from this that the third, fourth, and fifth
Freedoms " do not command general acceptance as principles
of international law.
Besides these two Agreements the Conference drew up a
Convention on International Civil Aviation setting out general
principles of international air law which were also to condition
the privileges granted in the two Agreements, and establishing
a permanent international civil aviation organisation. Further,
the Convention provided codes of operation for aircraft and
personnel and health and safety rules, and recommended
customs and immigration methods and navigational facilities
for Member States of the Organisation. The permanent
aviation organisation under the title of the International Civil
Aviation Organisation (I.C.A.O.) has been actively functioning
since 1947 with considerable achievements to its credit in the
legal and technical fields, including the adoption of standards
and recommended practices as annexes to the Convention, and
the adoption or conclusion of the Convention of 1948 on the
International Recognition of Rights in Aircraft, of the Rome
Convention of 1952 on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft
to Third Parties on the Surface, and of the Protocol of Amend-
ment to the Warsaw Convention of 19291 concerning the
1 The precise title of which is the Convention for the Unification of Certain
Rules Relating to International Transportation by Air, concluded at Warsaw,
October 12, 1929. The question of the revision of the Warsaw Convention,
so far as concerns the upper limit of liability for passenger injury or death, the
basis of responsibility, and related matters of insurance, became an acute issue
in 1965--1966, arising out of the United States Government's dissatisfaction
with the limit contained in the Convention, as amended at The Hague. This
led to the negotiation in 1966 of the so-called" Montreal Agreement", whereby
a number of foreign and United States carriers operating in or into the United
States undertook to accept a substantially higher limit and in effect acquiesced
in the principle of absolute liability; _cf._ R. H. Mankiewicz, " Air Transport
Liability---Present and Future Trends ", Journal of World Trade Law, Vol. III
(1969) pp. 32--48. In February-March, 1970, the Legal Committee of the
International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) prepared draft articles of
revision of the Convention, for submission to a diplomatic conference,
increasing the upper limit of liability, and providing for absolute liability except
where death or injury resulted solely from the passenger's infirmity; _see_
American Journal of International Law, Vol. 64 (1970), pp. 641--644.

188 Part 2.---States as Subjects of International Law
Liability of the Air Carrier to Passengers and Cargo, concluded
at The Hague in 1955.
The Chicago Conference did not result in material alterations
to the international law of the air. This is apparent from
a perusal of the more general chapters (Chapters I-III) of
the Convention on International Civil Aviation which lay
down principles very similar to those adopted in the Paris
Convention of 1919; for example, the principle of a State's
complete and exclusive sovereignty over the air space above
its territory (Articles 1--2), and the principles as to registration
and nationality of aircraft (Articles 17--21). The drafting was
sharpened in many respects; for example, Article 5, instead of
granting " freedom of innocent passage" according to the
somewhat ambiguous terms of Article 2 of the Paris Conven-
tion, granted to aircraft "not engaged in scheduled inter-
national air services the right to " make flights into or in
transit non-stop
across the territory of a State party, and to
make stops for non-traffic purposes " without obtaining that
State's prior permission, subject to the right of that State (for
example, for security reasons) to require immediate landing.
" Scheduled international air services" were not to be operated
"over or into the territory " of a contracting State, except with
the special permission or other authorisation of that State,
and in accordance with the terms of such permission
or authorisation, although non-scheduled aircraft might dis-
charge passengers, cargo, or mail, subject to the regulations,
etc., of the State concerned. Thus the distinction between
scheduled international air services, whose rights of overflight
or landing depend on the consent of the subjacent State, and
non-scheduled aircraft, with restricted rights of passage and
landing, was continued. One point of interest was that internal
air traffic, i.e. air cabotage, might be reserved entirely to the
territorial State, and by the conjoint effect of Articles 2 and 7,
included traffic between the mother country and overseas
1 Under the Convention, these rights of overflight and landing in territory
are subject to a number of qualifications and restrictions; e.g. as regards
routes, articles that may be carried, and areas that may be flown over.

------
Chap. 7.---State Territorial Sovereignty 189
territories or dependencies. Here again, the position under the
Paris Convention remained unchanged.1
Other important points under the Convention are that State
aircraft (including Government military aircraft) were to have
no rights of flight over or landing in the territory of other States
without special authorisation of the subjacent State, and that in
time of war or duly notified emergency, declared to be such,
States are free, whether as belligerents or neutrals, from obliga-
tions under the Convention, although they may opt to observe
these. Reference should be made also to the duties laid down
by the Convention in general terms that subjacent States should
observe equality of treatment and non-discrimination in regard
to other States using their air space, and that all States should
take such measures as are necessary to make international air
navigation safer and easier.
The above-mentioned principles represent the main general
rules of the international law of the air. They embrace an
exceedingly narrow range, leaving unregulated a host of impor-
tant matters affecting international air traffic. The need still
remains for a multilateral Convention to mitigate the effects of
the current rivalry for air routes and air commerce, although
such a Convention seems a visionary ideal.
As was foreshadowed when the Chicago Conference termi-
nated, the subject of allocation of traffic between competing
scheduled international airlines, which the Conference was not
· able to regulate by multilateral general agreement, has come
under regulation in particular cases by bilateral agreements
between the States concerned. One of the most important of
these treaties was the Bermuda Agreement of February, 1946,
between Great Britain and the United States, which has served
as a model for later bilateral agreements. This mushrooming
of bilateral treaties conferring, subject to ad hoc conditions, all
or some of the " Five Freedoms ", has not been without its
defects; it has, for instance seriously impaired the uniformity
1 The standard work on the law of international air transport is Bin Cheng,
The Law of International Air Transport (1962).
2 Non-scheduled air services also became the subject of bilateral agreements,
and in one instance of a multilateral agreement, namely the Agreement on
Commercial Rights of Non-Scheduled Air Services in Europe, concluded at
Paris on April 30, 1956.

190 Part 2.--States as Subjects of International Law
of law and practices which was one of the primary objects of
the Chicago Conference. On the other hand, a diligent
examination of the treaties reveals a number of similar or
common features, such as the dependence of transit and traffic
rights upon reciprocity, the recognition of a principle that
international air transport should be facilitated, and substantial
uniformity in the drafting of administrative and technical
clauses. In July, 1946, the United States had withdrawn from
the Air Transport or "Five Freedoms Agreement, thus
recognising that the international regulation of air traffic
by multilateral general agreement was impracticable. So, in
respect at least of scheduled international airlines or air services,
multilateralisation proved impossible, and as reflected in
bilateral networks of intergovernmental agreements concerning
transit, traffic, and landing rights, the doctrine of sovereignty
in the
closed air space
now prevails. Indeed, in other
areas, States appear to be extending rather than restricting this
doctrine, for example by the establishment for security purposes
of "air defence indentification zones" above the maritime
approaches to their coasts, and by other expedients.?
The recent emergence of wide-bodied airliners with greatly
augmented passenger capacity and increased rate of frequency
of journeys, by reason of higher speeds, has already pointed
to some problems in the practical working of bilateralism, which
is founded primarily upon the exchange of traffic rights. Such
an exchange becomes difficult where, in respect to a particular
country of embarkation and disembarkation, there is not
enough volume of traffic for economic division among carriers,
so that protectionist restrictions become necessary, unless it is
clear that the volume will increase. For this reason, if the
trend towards larger, speedier airliners continues upon a
global scale, multilateral or regional solutions may be needed.
Apart from aviation traffic, problems of abuse of the air

identification zones, _see_ Taubenfeld, Review of International Commission of
Jurists, December, 1969, p. 36 n. 2.
* An interesting post-war development has been the practice of nominating
  "air corridors", which may be used by approaching aircraft, leaving the
  remainder of the air space closed and under the absolute control of the
  authorities of the subjacent State, or territory.

have come within the scope of international law. In respect
to radiocommunications, two principles have emerged:---

(a)
That every State has a right to prevent its air space being
traversed by injurious transmissions of radio waves. (b) That
every State is under a duty not to allow, and to prevent its
territory being used for the transmission of radio waves
injurious to other States. Then there is the Moscow Treaty of
August 5, 1963, banning nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere,
in outer space, and under water; under this Treaty to which
over 100 States, but not all, are parties, the contracting States
undertake to prohibit, to prevent, and not to carry out any
nuclear weapon test explosion, at any place under their juris-
diction or control in the atmosphere, or beyond the limits
of the atmosphere, including outer space, or under water
including territorial waters or the high seas (_see_ Article I
generally). Other modern technological developments appear
to require some principles for the protection of all States
from injury through the air space; for example, States by the
use of rain-making devices in their air space may deprive
adjacent States of the benefit of rain-bearing clouds, thereby
causing a drought, or again by the use of atomic
energy
for
certain purposes, may cause dangerous radiations affecting the
air or clouds above the territory of neighbouring States. In
this connection, although no State is an insurer for neighbouring
States against damage to the air space, there is probably a duty
not to cause gross or serious damage which can be reasonably
avoided, and a duty not to permit the escape of dangerous
objects. The trend towards strict liability in this regard is
reflected in the Treaty on Principles governing the Activities of
States in the Exploration of Outer Space, including the Moon
and Other Celestial Bodies, signed on January 27, 1967, and
in the Draft Convention on International Liability for Damage
Caused by Space Objects, adopted on June 29, 1971 (_see below_).
In addition, there are problems such as those of pollution of
the air and of aircraft noise, which now come within the
scope of the wider subject of protection and improvement of the

human environment under international law, and which, for
this reason, are dealt with in Chapter 13, _post._, on Development,
and the Human Environment.1
Finally, a brief reference may be made to the problems of
international law created by air-cushion craft (i.e., hovercraft).
Under the domestic legislation of certain countries, air-cushion
craft have been treated to some extent as if they were aircraft.
However, in its session of November 8, 1967, the Council of the
International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) amended the
definition of aircraft in its Standards and Recommended
Practices in such a way as to exclude air-cushion craft, the
amended definition reading:---"Any machine that can derive
support in the atmosphere from the reactions of the air, other
than the reactions of the air against the earth's surface" (amend-
ment in italics). If there is to be an autonomous international
legal régime for air-cushion craft, as has been suggested by
some international lawyers, it may be necessary in the first in-
stance to classifyand distinguish the different kinds of such craft.2
Upper Strata of the Atmosphere, Outer Space, and the Cosmos
New problems of international law have been created by the
greatly intensified activities of States in the upper strata of the
atmosphere, in outer space, and in the cosmos, 3 and by the
correspondingly spectacular advances in space technology, in
astronautical navigation, and in planetary exploration, both
manned and unmanned.4

craft was considered at the 54th Conference in 1970, and a revised draft text
is to be submitted at the 55th Conference in 1972.

Chap. 7.-State Territorial Sovereignty 193
Into and through the upper strata of the atmosphere, that is
beyond the present operating ceilings of conventional jet
engine or piston engine aircraft?, States have been able to
project balloons, rockets, and long-range missiles, and to
transmit radio waves, while non-conventional machines, such
as rocket-powered aircraft, have demonstrated a capability
to reach unprecedented altitudes in the airspace.
As to outer space and the cosmos, the launching of the first
artificial earth satellite in 1957 by the Soviet Union has been
followed by space activities on a constantly increasing scale.
First, there have been not only the number, weight, and orbital
ranges of the satellites and sub-satellites projected, but also
their functional diversity, for purposes, inter alia, of meteor-
ology, missile detection, navigation, earth survey, monitoring
of pollution, ionospheric measurement, solar radiation measure-
ment, photography, and communications, including tele-
communications. Second, the Soviet Union and the United
States as the two principal space Powers have conducted far-
reaching experiments in penetration of the cosmos, beginning
with the Soviet Union's success in 1959 in hitting the moon and
photographing its reverse side, and continuing with even more
distant space probing, to planets such as Mars and Venus.
Third, the man-in-space programmes of these two Powers
resulted in sustained orbital flights by cosmonauts, and cul-
minated in the lunar landings and explorations by United
States cosmonauts in 1969--1971, while both manned and
unmanned rover vehicles have traversed lunar territory and
retrieved samples of lunar soil and rock. Apart from these
concrete results, the feasibility of space shuttles and space
stations appears to have been demonstrated.
In addition to the knowledge of the moon and planetary
system gained from the lunar landings and space probes, there
have been the great discoveries contributing to extra-terrestrial
science, namely those concerning the nature of space itself, the
1 Even high altitude flights of conventional aircraft have necessitated the
establishment of special control centres.

jected on the moon by the Soviet Union.

magnitude of the cosmic rays, the radiation zones surrounding
the earth, the extent of the earth's magnetic field, the character
of the ionosphere, and the measurement of micro-meteorite
density.
It has been difficult indeed for the international law of
space
to keep up with the unflagging speed of this progress in space
technology and exploration. Yet space law can only in a
very limited way anticipate these advances, for the formulation
of its rules is necessarily dependent upon reliable data obtained
through activities in outer space and the cosmos. As Judge
Manfred Lachs of the International Court of Justice, himself
a distinguished space lawyer, has said in another connection?:---

Whenever law is confronted with facts of nature or tech-
nology, its solutions must rely on criteria derived from them.
For law is intended to resolve problems posed by such facts
and it is herein that the link between law and the realities of
life is manifest. It is not legal theory which provides answers
to such problems; all it does is to select and adapt the one which
best serves its purposes, and integrate it within the framework
of law."
It has been sought to formulate some of the rules applicable
in this domain in the following instruments, namely:---

(a) The
nuclear weapons test ban treaty of 1963, referred to above,
under which States parties undertake to prohibit, prevent, and
not carry out nuclear weapon test explosions beyond the limits
of the atmosphere, including outer space; (b) The Treaty on
Principles governing the Activities of States in the Exploration
and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial
Bodies, signed on January 27, 1967 (referred to, _post._, as the
1967 Space Treaty); (c) The Agreement on the Rescue of
Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts, and the Return of
Objects Launched into Outer Space, signed on April 22, 1968
(referred to, _post._, as the 1968 Astronauts Agreement); (d) The
Draft Convention on International Liability for Damage
Caused by Space Objects (referred to, _post._, as the 1971 Draft
Liability Convention), adopted on June 29, 1971, by the Legal
Sub-Committee of the United Nations Committee on the

Chap. 7.-State Territorial Sovereignty 195
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space;1 (e) The Draft Treaty con-
cerning the Moon, submitted on June 4, 1971, to the United
Nations Secretary-General by the Soviet Union, for considera-
tion by the General Assembly at its 26th session, commencing
in September, 1971. There is also a large measure of agreement
on broad principles as reflected in a number of hortatory
General Assembly Resolutions. The most important instru-
ment to date is the 1967 Space Treaty which propounds in
effect a first code of space law, although it must be borne in
mind that all the instruments are interdependent, and were
largely influenced and conditioned by the principles and guide-
lines proclaimed by the General Assembly in its Resolutions.3
Upon the basis of these instruments and Resolutions, it
is possible, allowing for the risks of generalisation, to formulate
some of the fundamentals of the international law of space.
First, it is clear that the usque ad coelum rule, i.e., the doctrine
of the sovereignty of the subjacent State to an unlimited height,
cannot work in practice. States have not insisted on the rule,
inasmuch as they have acquiesced, and still acquiesce in the
repeated crossing, without their prior consent, of their super-
jacent space by orbiting satellites and capsules at heights of one
hundred miles and more. Apart therefrom, there is some
difficulty in applying to space, one of the considerations
notionally underlying the usque ad coelum rule, namely, that of
a vertical column which remains permanently and statically
appurtenant to a particular subjacent State, because this
does not strictly correspond to the scientific or astronomical
facts.4
I This Committee was established by the General Assembly on December 12,
1959, and primarily through its Legal Sub-Committee has proved to be the
main forum for the initiation and adoption of law-making projects in the
field of space law.

Resolutions on Outer Space; 'Instant International Customary Law?",

approved beforehand by General Assembly Resolutions on December 19,

196
Part 2.-States as Subjects of International Law
On the other hand, most States agree on the principle that,
particularly for security purposes, there must be sovereignty up
to some upper limit, i.e., some demarcation either in the upper
atmosphere itself, or between the atmosphere and space,
although there is no _consensus_ as to a precise figure for this
height. The suggested limits have ranged from 300 miles
upwards, although latterly a well-founded course of opinion
favours 50 miles or thereabouts, out of regard for the lower
limit of space in which artificial satellites have demonstrated
ability to orbit. There seems to be some apathy on the
question of the necessity for fixing a demarcation height, and
doubtless this reflects an underlying feeling that States may
come to possess rights to a greater height than is now regarded
as possible.? States appear ready to concede, albeit pro-
visionally without any final waiver of their sovereignty, a right
of innocent passage for objects launched for peaceful or scienti-
fic purposes, but not for military missiles. It seems undisputed
that each State may claim sovereignty up to that height of the
atmosphere where air density remains sufficient for the opera-
tion of conventional aircraft.
Second, outer space beyond this upper limit, whatever it may
be, and celestial bodies are subject to international law and the
United Nations Charter, are free for exploration and use by all
States on a basis of equality, in conformity with international
law, such exploration and use to be carried on for the benefit
and in the interests of all mankind, and are not subject to
national appropriation. These principles were specifically
commended to States by the United Nations General Assembly
1 Under a resolution adopted by the 1968 Conference of the International
Law Association, the term
outer space
as used in the 1967 Space Treaty
should be interpreted so as to include all space at and above the lowest perigree
achieved at the date of the Treaty (January 27, 1967) by any satellite put into
orbit, without prejudice to the question whether at some later date the term
is held to include space below such perigree.
2 According to a working paper prepared by the United Nations Secretariat
on the definition and/or delimitation of outer space (_see_ U.N. document
A/AC.105/C.2/7, 1970) no proposal on the matter appears to command general
support, while States are even divided about the necessity for such definition
or delimitation,

in its Resolutions of December 20, 1961, and of December 13,
1963, and were enunciated in articles I-III of the 1967 Space
Treaty. Article IV indeed makes provision that the moon and
other celestial bodies are to be used by all States parties ex-
clusively for peaceful purposes, prohibiting thereon the estab-
lishment of military bases, installations, and fortifications,
weapons testing, and military manoeuvres. Also under Article
II, outer space and celestial bodies are not subject to national
appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or
occupation, or by any other means. The Soviet Draft Treaty of
1971 concerning the Moon? contains, inter alia, provisions
prohibiting:(a) the establishment of sovereignty over any
part of the moon by States, international organisations, or
individuals; (b) military installations, weapon testing, or
military activities on the moon; and (c) the placement on the
moon, or in its orbit, of weapons of mass destruction.
Third, it is the duty of every State launching a satellite or
object into orbit or beyond, to give due notice of the launching
thereof, and information concerning such matters as orbits,
weights, and radio frequencies. In its above-mentioned
Resolution of December 20, 1961, the General Assembly called
on States to furnish such information promptly to the Com-
mittee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, through the
Secretary-General of the United Nations, and requested the
Secretary-General to maintain a public registry of such informa-
tion. Steps were subsequently taken to establish a public
registry of information concerning outer space launchings.?
Article XI of the 1967 Space Treaty casts a duty upon States
parties to inform the United Nations Secretary-General, as
well as the public and the international scientific community,
of the nature, conduct, locations, and results of activities in
space conducted by them, and such information is to be dis-
seminated by the Secretary-General, immediately and effectively.

2 In a Resolution of December 16, 1969, the General Assembly noted" with
appreciation " that, in accordance with the 1961 Resolution, the Secretary-
General was continuing to maintain a public registry of objects launched into
orbit or beyond.
S.I.L.-8

198
Part 2.--States as Subjects of International Law
This article stands in close relationship to Article 5 of the 1968
Astronauts Agreement, obliging States, according to the
circumstances, to give notice of the location of space objects
returned to earth, or to recover them, or to restore them to, or
hold them at the disposal of the launching authority.
Fourth, having regard to the discoveries concerning the
nature of outer space, it is the duty of every State launching
objects into orbit or beyond to take precautions to avoid injury
to other States, or any permanent changes in the environment
of the earth, or the contamination of the upper atmosphere
and outer space, and of celestial bodies and the earth, or any
impairment of the free use or scientific exploration of the
upper atmosphere and outer space. This basic duty has
received more ample expression in the provisions of Articles
VI, VII, and IX of the 1967 Space Treaty. Article VI sets out
in the most general terms that States parties to the Treaty are
to bear international responsibility for national activities in
outer space, while Article VII, dealing specifically with the
launching of space objects, lays down that each State party
launching or procuring the launching of a space object, or
from whose territory or facility an object is launched is inter-
nationally liable for damage to another State party or to its
nautral or juridical persons by such object on earth, in the
airspace, or in outer space. Article IX imposes a duty of
non-contamination, and of prevention of harm to the environ-
ment of earth resulting from the introduction of extraterrestrial
matter; there are also duties of consultation beforehand, if
any activity or experiment is believed to be potentially harmful
to the activities of other States parties in the exploration and
use of outer space.
The liability of States for damage caused by space objects
has been spelled out in more detail, as regards both substance
and procedure, in the 1971 Draft Liability Treaty. Under
Articles II-III, a launching State is to be " absolutely liable

of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space on the Work of its

Chap. 7.---State Territorial Sovereignty 199
to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object
on the earth's surface or to aircraft in flight, provided however
that if damage be caused elsewhere than on the surface of the
earth to a space object of another launching State or persons
or property aboard this object, it is to be liable only if the
damage is due to its fault? or the fault of persons for whom it is
responsible; while there is to be no liability for damage to
nationals of the launching State or foreign nationals partici-
pating in the operation of the space object, or during the time
when, by invitation, they are in the vicinity of the launching
or recovery area (_see_ Article VII). There is provision for a
Claims Commission to function where the question of compen-
sation cannot be settled by negotiation. The law to be applied,
and the measure of compensation are governed by the con-
troversial Article XII, according to which the matter is to be
determined "in accordance with international law and the
principles of justice and equity", compensation being that
which is required to restore the victim of damage to the con-
dition which would have existed if the damage had not occurred.
Reference should also be made in this connection to Article
5, paragraph 4 of the 1968 Astronauts Agreement, under which
a launching State receiving notification of the locating of one of
its space objects, believed to be of a hazardous or deleterious
nature, is immediately to take steps to eliminate possible
danger or harm.
One suggestion of some interest has been made, namely, that
there be so-called "crimes in space"; for example, the wilful
disregard by a launching State of a patent risk of grave injury
to the environment of the earth.
Fifth, communication by means of communication satellites
should be freely available to all States upon a global and non-
discriminatory basis. This principle was laid down in the
above mentioned General Assembly Resolution of December
20, 1961, and was reaffirmed by the General Assembly in a
Resolution of December 16, 1969. The arrangements for

Consortium), constituting a global communications satellite
system, which was first established in 1964,1 are founded upon
the principle that all States have the right of non-discriminatory
access to the use of the system. The subject of direct broadcast
satellites, which has been under examination by a Working
Group of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space,
involves a number of other legal implications. Since broad-
casts from such satellites to community or individual receivers
will not be realised for some time, it is perhaps premature to
examine the legal issues raised; at all events, it is claimed that
such broadcasts must be governed by international law and by
the provisions of the 1967 Space Treaty, and that every State
should be entitled to refuse a programme that a foreign State
proposed to beam into its territory.
Sixth, each State launching an object into outer space
retains its sovereign rights over the object, no matter where it
may be and where it may land. Correspondingly, the launching
State remains responsible for damage done by its space objects
to the extent set out above, while correlatively non-launching
States are, under Article 5 of the 1968 Astronauts Agreement,
bound according to the circumstances to give notice of the
location of space objects returned to earth, or to recover them,
or to restore them to, or hold them at the disposal of the
launching authority.
Seventh, States are under a duty to facilitate the passage of
objects intended for the exploration for peaceful purposes of
outer space, and to give aid to space ships making forced
landings on their territory. It is questionable whether the
duty of facilitation requires a State to make available its
cosmodromes for use by another launching State. A further
difficult point is whether a State which has granted tracking

United States, dated March 7, 1962.

Chap. 7.---State Territorial Sovereignty 201
station facilities to one State should be bound to make these
available to other States. In regard to rescuing astronauts,
the principle of all possible assistance in the event of accident,
distress, or emergency landing is laid down in Article V of the
1967 Space Treaty, coupled with provision for their safe and
prompt return to the State of registry of the space vehicle.
Astronauts are to be deemed envoys of mankind" in outer
space, and as between themselves, astronauts of one State party
are to render all possible assistance to astronauts of other
States parties so far as concerns activities in outer space and on
celestial bodies. Although the obligations of non-launching
States in this connection have been set out more specifically
in the 1968 Astronauts Agreement, it may still be necessary to
rely upon the width of the provisions in Article V of the 1967
Space Treaty, particularly for astronauts in distress in space
itself, as distinct from their being in a plight upon their return
to earth. The Astronauts Agreement imposes duties upon
States parties of notification or public announcement regarding
any plight or emergency landing of astronauts, of rescue and
assistance where astronauts land in territory under the juris-
diction of the State concerned, 1 of contributing assistance to
search and rescue operations in the event of their landing on the
high seas or places not under the jurisdiction of any State, and
of assuring the safe and prompt return of the astronauts to
representatives of the launching authority.
As at the present date, no specific principles of international
law concerning astronautical navigation, as such, have been
formulated. It has been reasonably claimed that the freedom
of the seas doctrine is applicable by analogy to outer space.
To some extent, the analogy has already been applied, for
under Article VIII of the 1967 Space Treaty, the State of registry
of a space object is to retain jurisdiction and control over the
object, and over any personnel aboard while the object is in
outer space or on a celestial body. The Treaty does not

launching authority (Article 2).

of identification of spacecraft.

------
202 Part 2.--States as Subjects of International Law
however provide for the grant of nationality to spacecraft
(contrast Article 5 of the Geneva Convention of 1958 on the
High Seas). As more is known of the factors governing the
paths and speeds of space vehicles, and the scientific forces
operating in the cosmos, it may become necessary to impose
restrictive rules for navigational safety and to prevent inter-
ference by space vehicles with each other, as well as to ensure
that no damage be done to the earth itself or its environment.
It has been sought to denuclearise outer space. Under
the first paragraph of Article IV of the 1967 Space Treaty,
States are under a duty not to place in orbit objects carrying
nuclear or mass destruction weapons, or to install or station
these on celestial bodies or in outer space; and a like provision
concerning the moon is contained in the 1971 Soviet Draft
Treaty concerning the Moon. Administration of outer space
by the United Nations has not been universally favoured by the
States. 1 Nevertheless, the United Nations can, in line with the
belief expressed by the General Assembly in its Resolution of
December 20, 1961, "provide a focal point for international
co-operation in the peaceful exploration and use of outer
space
Apart from the matters of space law, referred to above, the
United Nations has been concerned with the practical applica-
tions of space technology for the benefit of mankind, and the
result of the United Nations Conference on the Exploration
and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, held in Vienna in 1968, was
to promote certain steps for the transfer of space technology
to the developing nations. According to the Legal Sub-
Committee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer
Space,2 three subjects among others will call for action in the

Outer Space reported to the General Assembly that it did not favour the
establishment of an international agency to assume an over-all responsibility
for space matters. As Professor Taubenfeld has pointed out (_see_ Review of
International Commission of Jurists, December, |1969, at p. 30), the current
régime of space law is "one of self-denial and is self-policed; the nations
have firmly resisted creating any comprehensive, overall régime which would
include the placing of authority and control for outer space activities in any
international organisation".

(a) matters relating to the registration of objects
launched into space for the exploration or use of outer space;

(b) matters relating to the regulations needed to govern sub-
stances coming from the moon and from other celestial bodies,
including the principles governing activities in the use of the
natural resources of the moon and other celestial bodies;

(c) matters relating to activities carried out through remote-
sensing satellite surveys of earth resources. Space law cannot
be static; through the very nature of its subject-matter, it is
evolutionary.
Rights less than Sovereignty-Spheres of Influence and Spheres
of Interest
On many occasions, States have claimed in regard to certain
regions or territories, rights less than territorial sovereignty, and
falling short even of those exercised over a dependent territory
or vassal State. Such inchoate rights were known in diplo-
matic terminology as "spheres of influence" or " spheres of
interest", and were most commonly asserted in the late nine-
teenth century when international rivalry for the exploitation
of weak or backward countries was historically at its peak.
Although in view of such international engagements as those
contained in the United Nations Charter to respect the terri-
torial integrity of other countries it would not be politic today
to use these terms, it is hardly open to question that the con-
crete conceptions underlying them are still applied by the Great
Powers.
Perhaps the best definition of a " sphere of influence" is
that of Halli:---

an understanding which enables a State to reserve to
itself a right of excluding other European powers from territories
that are of importance to it politically as affording means of
future expansion to its existing dominions or protectorates, or
strategically as preventing civilised neighbours from occupying
a dominant military position ".
A "sphere of interest" differs only in direction of emphasis
from a "sphere of influence". A State asserts a sphere of

interest in a particular region when it claims to possess in that
region exclusive economic or financial concessions or exclusive
rights of exploitation, which it will not allow other Powers to
exercise.
2.-PARTS OF STATE TERRITORY, OR OTHER AREAS IN WHICH
SOVEREIGN RIGHTS ARE EXERCISED BY STATES
Having examined the nature, extent, and scope of territorial
sovereignty, we now turn to consider the various parts of
State territory over which this sovereignty is wielded. We shall
also consider other areas, such as the continental shelf and off-
shore waters, in which sovereign rights, falling short of terri-
torial sovereignty, may be exercised by States.
Boundaries
Boundaries are one of the most significant manifestations
of State territorial sovereignty. To the extent that they are
recognised expressly by treaty, or generally acknowledged
without express declaration, they constitute part of a State's
title to territory.
A boundary is often defined as the imaginary line on the
surface of earth, separating the territory of one State from that
of another. This is perhaps too artificial. As one writer
says?:---

"A boundary is not merely a line but a line in a borderland.
The borderland may or may not be a barrier. The surveyor
may be most interested in the line. To the strategist the
barrier, or its absence, is important. For the administrator,
the borderland may be the problem, with the line the limit of
his authority".
Where the borderland is of such a character that, notwith-
standing the boundary line running through it, the territory
itself and its inhabitants are fused for all practical purposes,
the two or more States concerned may tolerate (either by treaty
or by conduct) the existence in the borderland of administrative

disputes, _see_ Alastair Lamb, Australian Year Book of International Law, 1965,

Boundaries (London, 1965).

205
and other practices, for example the free movement of officials
throughout the borderland, which would otherwise be in
derogation of each other's sovereignty. The exceptional _de
facto_ relations between States and their citizens, arising out
of such special conditions in a borderland area, are sometimes
said to constitute relations of " voisinage".
Boundary disputes have occasioned many important inter-
national arbitrations; for example, the Alaska Boundary
Arbitration (1903), between the United States and Great Britain.
Such disputes were also the subject of two instructive decisions
of the International Court of Justice in 1959 and 1962 respec-
tively, in the Frontier Lands Case (Belgium-Netherlands)
and in the Case Concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (Merits)
(Cambodia-Thailand). In the former case, the Court gave
effect to allocations of territory in a Boundary Convention
of 1843,3 thus deciding that Belgium was entitled to certain
frontier lands; it refused to accept the contentions of the
Netherlands that the Convention was vitiated by mistake, and
that acts of sovereignty performed by local Netherlands
officials in the disputed areas could displace Belgium's title,
holding that these acts were only of a routine and adminis-
trative character. In the latter case, the disputed area was
the region of a certain Temple sanctuary (Preah Vihear), and
there was a conflict between the frontier according to a Treaty
of 1904, whereby it was to follow a watershed line, and the
frontier according to boundary maps completed in 1907, and
communicated in 1908 to the Siamese (now Thai) Government.
As the Siamese Government and later the Thai Government
had by their conduct apparently accepted the map frontier line,
and had not shown that any special importance was attached
to the watershed line, the Court held that the map line should

lands did not repudiate a Belgian assertion of sovereignty in an unratified
Convention.

be preferred, and that the Temple area was under the sovereignty
of Cambodia.1 Since these two decisions of the International
Court of Justice, there have been two important arbitral awards
in boundary disputes, that made in 1966 in regard to a boundary
in the Andes area between Argentina and Chile, and that
given in 1968 in the Rann of Kutch Arbitration between India
and Pakistan.3
In the terminology of the subject of boundaries, there is a
firmly established distinction between "natural" and "arti-
ficial" boundaries. Natural boundaries consist of mountains,
rivers, the seashore, forests, lakes and deserts, where these
divide the territory of two or more States. But used in a
political sense, the term "natural boundary " has a far wider
significance; it denotes the line defined by nature, up to which
a State considers its territory should be extended or delimited
at the expense of, or as protection against, other States. Arti-
ficial boundaries consist either of signs purposely erected to
indicate the course of the imaginary boundary line, or of
parallels of longitude or latitude.
Most difficulty as regards boundary delimitation has arisen
in the case of water boundaries. And of such water boundaries,
undoubtedly the most troublesome have been river boundaries,
the problem being to decide what line in the river should be
the boundary, and how it should be defined. In the case of
a non-navigable river, the boundary line in the absence of
contrary treaty provision runs down the middle of the river
or down its principal arm if it has more than one, following
all turnings of both banks. This line is known as the " median
line", and was adopted for non-navigable rivers by the
Peace Treaties of 1919--1920. Where the river is navigable,
the boundary line as a rule runs through the middle line of the
deepest navigable channel, or as it was technically called---the
Thalweg. In the Peace Treaties of 1919--1920, the expression

Chap. 7.--State Territorial Sovereignty 207
employed was "the median line of the principal channel of
navigation",1 which is more or less the same as the Thalweg. 2
Sometimes a boundary line lies along one bank of the river,
while the whole bed is under the sovereignty of the other
riparian State. This is an exceptional case arising under
treaty or by long established peaceable occupation.
In the case of lakes and land-locked seas, the choice of the
suitable boundary line depends on the depth, configuration,
and use of the particular lake or sea concerned. In a shallow
lake or sea, the navigable channel, if any, may be taken as a
convenient boundary. More generally, the boundary line
will be the " median line", as in the case of a river. Many
special apportionments have been made by treaty, but these
have been of the most arbitrary character, and have followed
no definite pattern or principle.
As to bays or straits, no general rules for boundary de-
limitation can be given, as considerations of history and
geography come into play. On many occasions, however, the
" median line" has been accepted as the boundary.
Rivers
Where a river lies wholly within the territory of one State,
it belongs entirely to that State, and generally speaking no
other State is entitled to rights of navigation on it. Also
where a river passes through several States, each State owns
that part of the river which runs through its territory, but
controversy has centred round the question of the rights of
riparian and other States to navigate along the whole length
of the river. Several writers on international law, commencing
with Grotius, have been of opinion that there is a general
right of passage for all States along such international rivers,
but this view has never been generally accepted in practice,
and is certainly not recognised as a customary principle of
international law. Even writers who hold that there is freedom
of navigation differ in their interpretation of the extent of this
1 _See_, e.g., Article 30 of the Treaty of St. Germain.
As to the Thalweg, _see_ the judgment of Mr. Justice Cardozo in New Jersey
v. Delaware (1934), 291 U.S. 361.

------
208
Part 2.-States as Subjects of International Law
right :---

(a) some writers hold that such right of passage is
confined to time of peace only; (b) others assert that only
countries through which an international river passes have a
right of passage?; (c) a third group maintains that the freedom
of passage is without any limitation, subject only to the right
of each State to make necessary and proper regulations in
respect to the use of the river within its boundaries. In
principle, the interpretation (b) is a reasonable one, as States
located on the upper portion of a river should not be debarred
from access to the sea.
However, such measure of freedom of navigation as became
established on international waterways was almost entirely
the creation of treaty. The process began with the Treaty of
Paris, 1814, and the Vienna Congress of 1815, and continued
with the Peace Treaties of 1919--1920, and the subsequent
general Conventions concluded under the auspices of the
League of Nations. As a result, there was, before the Second
World War, a limited freedom of navigation on most of the
great river systems of Europe, while river systems in other
Continents3 came under special regional agreements, or had
been opened for navigation, subject to varying restrictions, by
the States having sovereignty over them. Also, as the necessary
framework for a free right of passage, international authorities
had been set up to administer particular river systems. An
outstanding example of a European river subject to such
international control and regulation was the Danube. Under
the Treaty of Paris, 1856, a body called the European Com-
mission of the Danube consisting of representatives both of
riparian and non-riparian States was established to regulate
navigation on the most important sector---the lower Danube,

navigation along the rivers of Europe, but in the events which happened, this
principle did not receive full application.

Chap. 7.-State Territorial Sovereignty 209
and on it were bestowed wide powers of administration.
Under a Convention which came into force in 1922, a Definitive
Statute of the Danube was adopted confirming the powers of
the Commission but setting up two Commissions in lieu thereof
to manage the upper and lower portions of the river. These
arrangements stabilised the situation on the river for many
years, but were completely upset by the Second World War.
In 1947, the Paris Peace Conference caused to be inserted in
the peace treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Roumania a
clause that navigation on the Danube, other than traffic
between ports of the same State, should be free and open on a
footing of equality. In 1948, a Conference to work out a new
Convention to govern `navigation on the Danube met at
Belgrade. This conference by a majority and against the
wishes of the delegations of France, Great Britain, and the
United States adopted a new Convention providing for
a Commission composed entirely of representatives of
riparian States. These three countries claimed that the new
Statute was invalid as displacing the acquired rights of non-
riparian States under the earlier treaties. It should be added
that by its Article 1, this Convention provided for freedom of
navigation on the Danube.1
The Peace Treaties of 1919--1920 internationalised certain
European rivers, and also laid the foundations of the work
of the League of Nations through its Transit and Communica-
tions Organisation, whose avowed object was to achieve
freedom of navigation on all rivers. The League sought to
accomplish this by sponsoring the adoption of international
Conventions providing for freedom of passage, such as the
Convention on the Regime of Navigable Waterways of Inter-
national Concern, and the Convention on Freedom of Transit, 2
both adopted at Barcelona in 1921.
1 But omitted the provision in Article 1 of the 1921 Convention that there
should be no differentiation of treatment as between riparian and non-riparian
States.
2 The principle of international freedom of transit by the most convenient
routes was again proclaimed in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) of October 30, 1947 (_see_ Article V).

------
210
Part 2.--States as Subjects of International Law
The League of Nations also endeavoured to unify river law
by sponsoring the conclusion in 1930 of Conventions dealing,
for this purpose, with collisions between inland river vessels,
the registration of inland shipping, and the flags of such vessels.
More recent Conventions on the same lines are the Bangkok
Convention of July 22, 1956, for facilitating inland navigation
between Asian countries, and the Geneva Convention of
March 15, 1960, relating to the Unification of Certain Rules
concerning Collisions in Inland Navigation.
Yet, these treaties have neither singly nor cumulatively
established a general right of passage along international rivers.
If general freedom of fluvial navigation appears too Utopian
an ideal for international-law to achieve, there is at least room
for rules of more limited scope, tempering the restrictive
practices followed by riparian States. Thus it might well be
generally recognised that such States should not impose
arbitrary or excessive dues and should not treat non-riparian
States in a discriminatory or unequal manner, that access to
fluvial ports should be free and equal, and that all navigable
channels in internationally used waterways should be properly
maintained, with due warning of dangers where necessary.
Subject to this, the necessity for regional agreements dealing
separately with the problems peculiar to each international
river system cannot be gainsaid. As an example of regional
co-operation, there may be cited the United States-Canada
arrangements of 1954 for the St. Lawrence Seaway, opened in
1959, as well as the International Joint Commission established
by these two countries under their Boundary Waters Treaty
of 1909.
So far as the injurious use of river waters, or the diversion
of and interference with the free flow of rivers is concerned,
international law has not advanced to the stage of settled rules
in either domain.1 It is believed that there is a general readiness
of States to admit that any such use or diversion or interference
by one riparian State injuring the free navigability of a navigable
international waterway to the detriment of a co-riparian State
1 _Cf._ Hyde, International Law (2nd Edition, 1947), Vol. I, pp. 565 _et seq._

------
Chap. 7.~-State Territorial Sovereignty
211
is a breach of international law. Short of this, it is perhaps
only possible to say that there is a duty on a riparian State
not, by any use of the river waters under its control, to cause
grievous or irreparable damage of an economic character to
other riparian States, for example pollution, which might
reasonably have been prevented. In 1957, it was decided by
the Arbitral Tribunal in the Lake Lanoux Arbitration (France-
Spain)ể that there was no duty on a riparian State under custo-
mary international law to consult, or obtain the prior agree-
ment of a co-riparian, as a condition precedent of its right to
begin new river works, although in carrying out the project it
must take into account, in a reasonable manner, the interests of
that co-riparian. Where the rivers concerned form part of a
drainage basin, each riparian State is entitled to a reasonable
and equitable share in the beneficial uses of the waters of the
basin, a principle applied in numerous treaties. Essentially,
such problems of the utilisation of rivers by one State to the
injury of other States are a matter for treaty arrangement, or for
settlement by arbitration or conciliation in the most equitable
manner.3
In 1970, the idea was mooted of a general convention on the
law of international watercourses, analogous to the Geneva
Conventions of 1958 on the law of the sea. It has been justly
claimed that the customary law on the subject of international

  national Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in settlement of the
  dispute since 1948 relating to the Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum Rivers. Pakistan
  had claimed that Indian activities were interfering with its measures for flood
  control, irrigation, and developing hydro-electric power. Under the Agree-
  ment, the waters of the Western rivers, Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum, were
  allocated to Pakistan, and the waters of the Eastern rivers, Ravi, Beas, and
  Sutlej to India after a transitional period of ten years, during which a tem-
  porary arrangement for mutual use of the waters of all the streams was to
  continue, pending the completion of water storage and irrigation works by
  Pakistan using the waters of the Western rivers.

rivers is inadequate to deal with the newer technological uses
of rivers, the problems of pollution, and the trend towards
systematic development of river basins as one unit. On the
other hand, it is an equally cogent objection to such a proposal
that to attempt to draft a universal text, encompassing the
various regional, local, and other aspects, peculiar to certain
international rivers and certain international drainage basins,
is not practicable, and that regional or local regimes are pre-
ferable to a universal regime, which in the nature of things
can only consist of highly general, if not abstract rules.
At its 52nd Conference at Helsinki in 1966, the International
Law Association approved a set of draft Articles on the uses
of waters of international rivers, and resolved that these should
bear the title of the " Helsinki Rules on the Uses of Waters of
international rivers and certain international drainage basins,
of approval, and break new ground in certain respects, for
example in the proposed rules to deal with water pollution and
floating timber.2 At least, the draft Articles reflect an en-
lightened appreciation of the new problems connected with
regulations for the waters of international rivers and drainage
basins, and could well serve as a basic draft for a proposed
general Convention.
Internal Waters, the Territorial Sea, and the Contiguous Zone
The customary rules of international law concerning the
coastal waters of a maritime State were restated, and in certain
respects extended, in the Convention on the Territorial Sea
and Contiguous Zone, signed at Geneva on April 29, 1958,
drawn up by the first Conference on the Law of the Sea. This
Convention was based upon Draft Articles prepared by the
International Law Commission.
_See_ Report of the 52nd Conference of the Association, 1966, pp. 484--533
for text of the Rules, and commentary thereon.
2 _See_ Chapters 3 and 5, respectively, of the Rules.
3 The International Law Commission expressed a preference for the term
" territorial sea over "territorial waters to denote the maritime belt of
coastal waters, because " territorial waters may include internal waters; _see_
Report concerning the work of the fourth session of the Commission (1952).

------
Chap. 7.-State Territorial Sovereignty 213
According to the Convention, the coastal waters of a maritime
State fall into three categories:---


(1) Internal waters, for example, ports, harbours, roadsteads,
closed-in bays and gulfs, and waters on the shoreward side of
the straight baselines from which the territorial sea may be
measured, as mentioned below. Over such waters, the coastal
State has sovereignty as complete as over its own territory, and
may deny access to foreign vessels, except when in distress, or
except when access to ports must be allowed by treaty, or
except when the passage of foreign vessels must be permitted
under Article 5 paragraph 2 of the Convention (_see below_).

(2) The territorial sea, or maritime belt, being a belt of
coastal waters to a width of at least three miles, measured from
the low-water mark, or from selected straight baselines drawn
at a distance from the coast. Subject to the right of innocent
passage of foreign vessels (_see below_), and subject to the duty
of the coastal State to warn passing vessels against known
dangers of navigation, that State has sovereignty over the
territorial sea.

(3) The contiguous zone, being a belt contiguous to the
territorial sea, but not extending beyond twelve miles from the
low-water mark or other selected straight baselines. The
littoral State does not have sovereignty over this zone, but may
exercise control therein for the purpose of enforcing compliance
in its territory and territorial sea with certain of its laws and
regulations (_see below_).
As to (1), internal waters, the effect of Article 5 paragraph 2
of the Convention is that where the selected straight baselines
drawn by a coastal State have the result of transforming into
internal waters, areas formerly considered as part of the terri-
torial sea or of the high seas, foreign vessels are to have the
same rights of passage through these newly created internal
waters as through the territorial sea.

belt to the littoral State under customary international law, was
conditioned by rational and historical considerations. Origi-
nally, several maritime States had asserted rights of appropria-
tion and ownership of portions of the open sea, but because
no single State could ever effectively occupy large stretches of
the ocean, these extensive claims were gradually whittled down
until finally the only parts of the open sea over which a State
was recognised to have sovereignty were such coastal waters
as were necessary to that State's safety or which it had power
to dominate. The principle of sovereignty over the maritime
belt thus developed contemporaneously and coextensively with
the doctrine of the freedom of the seas. By the beginning of
the eighteenth century, the principle had completely established
itself. It was indeed in 1702 that Bynkershoeka published his
work, De dominio maris dissertatio (Essay on Sovereignty over
the Sea), in which he adopted the rule that the littoral State
could dominate only such width of coastal waters as lay within
range of cannon shot from shore batteries :---
" Terrae potestas
finitur ubi finitur armorum vis" (territorial sovereignty extends
as far as the power of arms carries).
Bynkershoek appears to have been the first jurist to enunciate
the cannon-shot rule in these terms, although the rule was
already well-known and invoked in practice before the publi-
cation of his book.
At a subsequent stage, an attempt was made to express the
cannon-shot range as a definite figure in miles. It is not clear
when precisely, as a matter of history, this first occurred. At
all events, the cannot-shot rule became blended with a three-
miles limit, although it is possible that the three-miles limit
had an independent historical origin. As will appear, the
point is now purely academic.
In the nineteenth century, the three-miles limit received
widespread adoption by the jurists, as well as by the Courts3
and in the practice of States. This continued too in the

fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and in the first half of the seventeenth century.

twentieth century, with two great maritime Powers, the United
States and Great Britain, firm protagonists of the limit. Yet it
failed to gain acceptance as a general rule of international law.
Numerous States adopted a wider limit for the territorial sea,
while in the last six years, an increasing number have come to
favour a limit as extensive as twelve miles, and even greater
distances. Indeed in February, 1970, it was officially made
known that consultations had been proceeding for some time
between the United States and other countries for the con-
clusion of a multilateral treaty to fix a maximum all-purpose
limit of twelve miles. In 1964, British fishery limits legislation,
viz., the Fishery Limits Act, 1964, which came into force in 1966,
was enacted to ordain a twelve-miles coastal fisheries limit,
subject to special rights for foreign fishermen within the range
of six to twelve miles, designated as the "outer belt " (_see_ s. 1).2
Prior to these developments, the task of fixing a recognised
maximum width of the territorial sea had been attempted by
three international conferences, the Hague Codification Con-
ference of 1930, the first Geneva Conference on the Law of the
Sea in 1958, and the second Geneva Conference on the Law of
the Sea in 1960, but in each case without success, and to no
purpose except to give emphasis to the disagreements on the
extent of the belt. At the Hague Codification Conference of
1930, the principal issue was whether the three-miles limit should
be recognised as this maximum, but there was such firm opposi-
tion to it that, to quote Gidel, 3 it emerged as "the chief victim
of the Conference, as an "idol dethroned and not restored ".
At the Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1958 and
1960, one issue was whether a twelve-miles limit should be
recognised. The United States and Great Britain, together
with other States, were prepared to concede a six-miles limit,
but would not accept a twelve-miles limit. The twelve-miles

216 Part 2.-States as Subjects of International Law
limit was rejected, and compromise proposals based on a six-
miles limit and a twelve-miles coastal fishery zone also failed
to receive the necessary support.
States originally opposing a twelve-miles limit were concerned
not only that the area of the high seas available for free naviga-
tion, free fisheries, and free overflight by aircraft be not diminish-
ed, but also had in mind fundamental matters of security, such
as the possibility that, in time of war, belligerent Powers with
large underwater fleets would have an advantage over Powers
whose superiority lies in the possession of surface vessels of
war, in that submarines might travel undetected through an
extensive area of territorial sea belonging to neutral States.
Such a clandestine use of the neutral territorial sea would
obviously not be open to surface warships. For this, among
other reasons, the three-miles limit while dead, had not been
interred, but surely in the light of the current weight of State
practice, and the consultations (mentioned, _ante_) with a view
to fixing a twelve-miles limit by multilateral treaty, the time
has come when the moribund three-miles limit should receive a
decent burial.
In regard to the delimitation of the territorial sea, the Con-
vention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone gives
effect to the baselines method recognised by the decision of the
International Court of Justice in 1951 in the Anglo-Norwegian
Fisheries Case. There the Court held that a Norwegian
decree of July, 1935, delimiting an exclusive Norwegian fisheries
zone by reference to straight baselines drawn through 48
selected points on the mainland or islands or rocks at a con-
siderable distance from the coast, from which baselines the
breadth of the territorial sea was to be measured, was not
contrary to international law. Article 4 follows the Court's
decision in providing:---

(a) that in " localities where the coast-
line is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of
islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity", the method of
straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed
1 1.C.J. Reports (1951), 116--206. For comment and discussion concerning
the case, _see_ Johnson, International Law and Comparative Legislation Quarterly
(1952), Vol. 1, at pp. 145 _et seq._

Chap. 7.---State Territorial Sovereignty 217
in forming the baselines from which the breadth of the terri-
torial sea is to be measured; (b) that the drawing of such
baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent from the
general direction? of the coast; and (c) that the areas lying
within the baselines must be sufficiently closely linked to the
land domain to be subject to the regime of internal waters.
The baselines must be clearly indicated on charts to which due
publicity is given. If these conditions for permitting the draw-
ing of baselines are satisfied, account may be taken, in deter-
mining particular baselines, of economic interests peculiar to
the region concerned," the reality and the importance of which
are clearly evidenced by a long usage". In other words, in the
absence of the requisite geographical conditions, economic
interests of the coastal State cannot alone justify recourse to
the baselines method. The baselines system is recognised
and adopted in the above-mentioned United Kingdom Fishery
Limits Act, 1964.
Where the straight baselines method is not permissible, the
territorial sea is to be measured from the low-water line along
the coast as marked on large scale charts officially recognised
by the coastal State.
Underlying these provisions is the same general considera-
tion as that in which the decision in the Fisheries Case is rooted,
namely that the territorial sea is not so much a limited artificial
extension of a State's territorial domain, as an appurtenant
contiguous area wherein for economic, security and geographi-
cal reasons the coastal State is entitled to exercise exclusive
sovereign rights.
The nuclear weapons test ban treaty of August 5, 1963,
referred to aboveapplies to tests in all three categories of the
coastal waters of any State party to the treaty.
From the absolute sovereignty of the littoral State over the
maritime belt flow two plenary rights of immense importance.

coast, _see_ Shalowitz, Shore and Sea Boundaries, Vol. I (1962), pp. 74--75.

218 Part 2.---States as Subjects of International Law
In the first place, the littoral State may reserve fisheries in the
maritime belt exclusively for its own subjects. As a rule, the
subjects of foreign States acquire fishery rights in such waters
only where the littoral State has signed with the foreign State
concerned a treaty permitting this. Secondly, the littoral
State may if it so desires also reserve cabotage for its own
subjects in coastal waters and exclude foreign vessels from
this privilege. Cabotage in its modern sense means intercourse
by sea between any two ports of the same country whether
on the same coasts or different coasts provided that the
different coasts are all of them the coasts of one and the
same country.
In respect to the surface and subsoil of the maritime belt,
and also the superincumbent air space, Article 2 of the Geneva
Convention of 1958 on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone
removes any doubt? by providing that the coastal State has
sovereignty over all these.
It is a recognised principle of customary international law
that foreign merchant vessels have a right of innocent passage
through the territorial sea. The nature and extent of this right
of innocent passage are defined in detail in Articles 14 to 23 of
the Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone.
Government vessels, including warships, are to enjoy this right
as well as merchant ships, and in their case no prior authorisa-
tion or notification is stipulated. The right includes stopping
and anchoring, but only insofar as these are incidental to
ordinary navigation, or are rendered necessary by force majeure
or by distress. Passage is "innocent " so long as it is not pre-
judicial to the peace, good order, or security of the coastal
State; e.g., the transport of persons or goods which might
endanger the safety of the coastal State, renders the passage

ship of Offshore Mineral Rights (1967), 65 D.L.R. (20) 353, at pp. 365--367.
2 _See_ Article 22, according to which Articles 14 to 17 are to apply to Govern-
ment vessels operated for non-commercial purposes. Formerly, it was a matter
of usage that warships were in time of peace allowed freely to navigate through
coastal waters. In the Corfu Channel Case (Merits), I.C.J. Reports (1949) 4 _et
seq._, it was recognised that in time of peace warships are entitled to a right of
innocent passage through such parts of the territorial sea as forman international
highway.

------
Chap. 7.-State Territorial Sovereignty 219
objectionable. Moreover, a special rule applies to foreign
fishing vessels; their passage is not to be considered innocent if
they do not observe the laws and regulations of the coastal State
for the prevention of fishing in the territorial sea. Submarines,
passing through the territorial sea, are required to navigate on
the surface and show their flag.
The coastal State must not hamper the innocent passage of
foreign vessels through the territorial sea, although it may
temporarily suspend passage in specified areas if such suspen-
sion is essential for the protection of its security, and provided
that it has duly published such order of suspension. Vessels
on passage through the territorial sea must comply with the
laws and regulations of the coastal State, in particular those
relating to transport and navigation. Quaere, whether the
coastal State may prevent the passage of a merchant vessel
which does not comply with its laws and regulations. In the
case of warships, it is expressly provided in Article 23 of the
Convention that if a warship does not comply with the coastal
State's regulations as to passage through the territorial sea and
disregards any request for compliance made to it, the coastal
State may require the warship to leave the territorial sea.
These provisions of the Convention will in the future need
some revision to deal with the right of passage of nuclear-
powered vessels, and the need to ensure the safety of the coastal
State.
As to the third category of coastal waters, the contiguous
zone, the Convention recognises and gives effect to the doctrine
that the coastal State may have rights for limited purposes in
this zone. Article 24 provides that in the contiguous zone, the
littoral State may exercise, not sovereignty, but the control
necessary to:---

(a) prevent infringement of its customs, fiscal,
immigration, or sanitary regulations within its territory or
territorial sea; (b) punish infringements of these regulations
committed within its territory or territorial sea. Moreover, the
contiguous zone is not to extend beyond twelve miles from

a noted French jurist, M. Louis Renault. _See_ Riesenfeld, The Protection of
Coastal Fisheries under International Law (1942) at p. 105.

Part 2.--States as Subjects of International Law
the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is
measured.1 It is obvious that Article 24 will need revision in
the light of the new coastal fishery limits recently adopted by
so many States, and in the light of the demise of the three-miles
limit.
On the subject of internal waters and the territorial sea,
mention should be made also of:---

(a) The claims of Indonesia
and the Philippines that the whole of the waters of archipelagoes
may be claimed as internal waters, and that perimeter base lines
may be drawn, enclosing them. Archipelagoes were not dealt
with in the Convention. (b) The claims advanced by Chile,
Ecuador, and Peru to exclusive sovereign rights, for fishing and
fishery conservation purposes, over a zone of the contiguous
sea extending to 200 miles in width. Joint action was taken by
these three States to give sanctity to their claims by regional
agreements at Santiago in 1952, and Lima in 1954, and by
repeated declarations. These claims have been the subject of
protest, and have not been generally recognised.
Straits
The rules as to the maritime belt considered above are
partially applicable to straits.
Clearly the waters of straits of a width less than six miles,
dividing the territory of the one State, are territorial; and if
straits of such a width divide the territory of two States, the
waters thereof are territorial, and the line of division will
normally run down the middle. Controversy arises where the
width of the straits exceeds six miles. Some writers hold that
such waters are territorial, others do not. Besides, there is the
case of certain straits which have long been regarded, through
general acquiescence of States, as having a territorial character;
for example, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which is about fifteen
miles wide, and which is divided between the littoral States,
Canada to the North, and the United States to the South.
1 Article 30 of the Convention provides at after five years from the entry
into force of the Convention, a request for its revision may be made by any
party, and the United Nations General Assembly shall decide upon the steps,
if any, to be taken in respect of such request.

------
Chap. 7.-State Territorial Sovereignty
221
A right of innocent passage through such straits as form
part of an international maritime highway is allowed both to
foreign merchant shipping and to foreign men-of-war. In the
Corfu Channel Case (Merits)1 the International Court of
Justice said that the " decisive criterion" of a strait as an inter-
national maritime highway was its geographical situation as con-
necting two parts of the open sea and the fact of its use for
international navigation, not whether there was a considerable
volume of traffic passing through it. Nor was the fact decisive
that a strait was not a necessary route between two portions of
the high seas, but only an alternative passage. In the light of
Article 16 paragraph 4 of the Convention on the Territorial Sea
and Contiguous Zone of April 29, 1958, this right was regarded
as applicable to straits which are " used for international navi-
gation between one part of the high seas and another part of the
high seas or the territorial sea of a foreign State ", thus covering
straits connecting the open sea with a territorial bay or land-
locked sea, which are of the nature of an international maritime
highway. There is some dispute nevertheless as to whether
warships have at all times a right of passage through straits
constituting an international highway, and consisting wholly of
territorial sea.
Certain straits are subject to special local regulations, as for
example the Straits of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles,
connecting the Black Sea with the Mediterranean, for which a
special regime was provided by the Montreux Straits Conven-
tion of 1936. This Convention endeavoured to reconcile the
interests of Turkey---the littoral State---with the rights of
foreign maritime Powers. The general principle adopt by
the Convention was to allow freedom of navigation to merchant
vessels of all nations, whether in peace or in war, subject only
to certain conditions and restrictions, and to the paramount
right of Turkey to refuse a right of passage to merchant vessels
of countries at war with it. There were also special provisions
· as to the passage of men-of-war, including limitations of
tonnage at any one time, designed to safeguard the vital rights

Bays, Gulfs, and other Coastal Indentations
The decision of the International Court of Justice in the
Fisheries Case, and the Convention on the Territorial Sea and
Contiguous Zone of April 28, 1958, have confirmed a trend
perceptible in the decisions of international tribunals and State
practice to the effect that bays and gulfs raise from the stand-
point of the littoral State entirely different considerations from
those connected with the open coast, and therefore should
more naturally come under that State's control, whether for
reasons of defence or national integrity or because of economic
matters. These considerations to some extent conditioned the
conception, prior to the Fisheries Case, of "historic" bays or
gulfs, 3 that is to say, those of which the waters had come to be
regarded as territorial in the course of a long period of acquies-
cence by non-littoral States, irrespective of the distance between
the headlands.
Prior to the Fisheries Case, the practice of Great Britain and
some other States was to regard the waters of bays with an
entrance not more than six miles wide as internal; there was,
however, at the same time a considerable weight of opinion and
practice to the effect that the waters of a bay enclosed by a
baseline drawn across the bay at a point where it was not more
than ten miles wide, were also internal. In the Fisheries Case,
a majority of the Court favoured the recognition of the waters
of bays or gulfs as internal waters where, by long practice of
the coastal State, acquiesced in by other States, these had been
treated as such, or where economic considerations or the close
connection of the bay or gulf with the land domain justified
the coastal State in proclaiming these as territorial waters. The

  ground that an unequivocal assertion of sovereignty by Great Britain early
  in the nineteenth century had remained unquestioned for over fifty years.

223
1958 Convention which covers only bays adjacent to one (and
not two or more) countries, has, however, adopted a rather
different and more precise approach. First, the Convention
contains a definition of bays, in such a way as to exclude mere
curvatures of the coast. Second, if the distance between the
low-water marks of the natural entrance of a bay does not
exceed twenty-four miles, a closing line may be drawn between
these two low-water marks, and the waters enclosed thereby
are to be considered as internal waters. 2 Where the distance
between the low-water marks of the natural entrance points
exceeds twenty-four miles, a straight baseline of twenty-four
miles is to be drawn within the bay in such a manner as to
enclose the maximum area of water that is possible with a line
of that length. Third, these provisions are not to apply to
historic" bays, 3 or to any case where straight baselines may
justifiably be drawn outside coastal indentations. Accordingly,
this leaves room for States to establish sovereign claims to the
waters of bays under historic title.
The Continental Shelf and Submarine Areas
New rules concerning the continental shelf and other offshore
areas beyond the territorial sea were contained in the Conven-
tion on the Continental Shelf, signed at Geneva on April 29,
1 _See_ Article 7. A bay is defined as a well-marked indentation whose
penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain land-
locked waters and to constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast, and
provided that the area of the indentation is as large as, or larger than that of
the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that inden-
tation. Paragraph 3 of Article 7 lays down how the area is to be measured;
it also makes provision for the case where islands are present within the
indentation. As 'to whether the Thames Estuary is a bay, _see_ E. D. Brown,
Australian Year Book of International Law, 1966, pp. 102--103.
2 _Cf._ the U.K. Territorial Waters Order in Council 1964, Article 4.
8 The International Law Commission was requested by the General Assembly
in December, 1959, to study the regime of "historic " waters, including
" historic bays. At the request of the Commission, the United Nations
Secretariat prepared a study on the subject (for text of this study, _see_ Yearbook
of the I.L.C., 1962, Vol. II, pp. 1--26). One conclusion of this study is that the
doctrine of historic waters is not really an exception to the general rules of
international law as to the delimitation of the maritime domain, but an in-
dependent doctrine standing upon its own merits and criteria.

Sea, 1
224 Part 2.-States as Subjects of International Law
1958, and drawn up by the first Conference on the Law of the
The Convention may be taken as enunciating the prin-
ciples on which there is general agreement. It has materially
altered the law of the high seas.
What is commonly meant by the " continental shelf" or the
"continental platform " is the submerged bed of the sea, con-
tiguous to a continental land mass, and formed in such a
manner as to be really an extension of, or appurtenant to this
land mass, but not situated in general at a greater depth beneath
the sea level than 200 metres. At approximately this depth
there occurs, as a rule, the first substantial " fall-off" to the
vastly greater ocean depths. Beyond such outer edge or
declivity of the continental shelf, the deep seabed descends by
further stages, known according to current nomenclature?
as the "continental slope", and the "continental rise",
before sinking into the deeper ocean floor, or" abyssal plain ".
The expression" continental margin " is ir current use to
encompass collectively the shelf, slope, and rise, the outer limit
of such continental margin being the commencement, so far
as it can be defined geomorphologically, of the abyssal plain.
In the North Sea Continental Shelf Cases,3 it was this
geological context which persuaded the International Court of
Justice, when seeking to rationalise the basis of shelf claims, to
attach primary importance to the consideration that the shelf
was a natural prolongation or continuation of the land domain,
and therefore appurtenant to territory over which the coastal
State already had dominion.
The Convention represented the culmination of a trend
which began in 1945--1949 when, by unilateral declarations, a
number of maritime States laid claim to exclusive jurisdiction
or control over the resources of the continental shelf, and

Law Commission; _see_ Report on the Work of the Commission's eighth session
(1956).

associated offshore areas. 1
It was sought to justify these
claims by considerations of geographical contiguity, and of
security. Although initially the object was to reserve to the
littoral State such oil as might lie in shelf areas, the drilling of
which had been made possible by advances in technology,
the claims were expressed in terms sufficient to cover all
minerals and even non-mineral resources. The actual extent
of the claims varied; the Proclamation of the President of the
United States in September, 1945, reserved only rights of
" jurisdiction and control" over the natural resources of the
subsoil and seabed of the shelf, expressly leaving intact the
nature of the shelf waters as high seas and the right of free
navigation, but in the later declarations of other States, claims
were laid to sovereignty and ownership over the seabed and
subsoil of, as well as over the waters of the shelf. Naturally,
such claims involved an extension of jurisdiction or sovereignty
beyond the territorial sea, even far beyond the width of the
contiguous zones. For instance, the United States continental
shelf was officiallya described as:---

almost as large as the area embraced in the Louisiana
Purchase, which was 827,000 square miles, and almost twice as
large as the original 13 colonies, which was 400,000 square
miles. Along the Alaska coastline the shelf extends several
hundred miles under the Bering Sea. On the Eastern coast of
the United States the width of the shelf varies 20 miles to
250 miles, and along the Pacific coast it is from 1 to 50 miles
wide."
Owing to the magnitude of the areas of the continental shelf,
there was therefore little analogy between these claims and
claims exclusively to control limited areas of the seabed out-
side the territorial sea for pearl, oyster, and other sedentary
fisheries. These more limited claims rested on the occupation
of the seabed as a res nullius or upon some historical or quasi-
66

that the territorial sea should be extended to cover the continental shelf.

prescriptive title or upon some particular regional community
of interest (e.g. the pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf).
Some jurists went so far as to assert that a new principle of
customary international law had emerged, entitling the coastal
State to exclusive rights for the purpose of exploring or exploit-
ing the resources of the seabed and subsoil of the continental
shelf. In 1951, however, a learned Arbitratori declared that
the doctrine of the continental shelf did not have the " hard
lineaments or the definitive status of an established rule of
international law", and in that connection, it could hardly be
maintained that the various Acts and Proclamations of only a
limited number of States, claiming sovereign rights over shelf
areas, without uniformity, had by their recurrence contributed
to the formation of a customary rule of international law.
Broadly speaking, the 1958 Convention recognised and gave
effect to the doctrine which underlay the above-mentioned
declarations of States, but stopped short of acknowledging any
unlimited jurisdiction by a coastal State over shelf waters.
None the less, some of the rationalisations in the Convention
go very far. For instance, the concept of the continental
shelf adopted by the Convention is purely notional, the geo-
logical concept of the shelf being discarded in favour of criteria
of depth and exploitability, irrespective of whether there is or
is not a marine shelf geologically appurtenant to a coastal
State. Thus in Article 1, the expression " continental shelf" is
defined as referring to "the seabed and subsoil of the sub-
marine areas adjacent to the coast outside the area of the
territorial sea, to a depth of 200 metres or, beyond that limit,
to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the
exploitation of the natural resources of the said areas". Even
the word " continental " loses its force, as by the same Article,
the expression " continental shelf" includes also " the seabed
and subsoil of similar submarine areas adjacent to the coasts of
islands".

receive equality of treatment.

Chap. 7.---State Territorial Sovereignty
227
Thus, the title " Convention on the Continental Shelf" is a
misnomer, since the Convention applies not only to the con-
tinental shelf, but as well to considerable areas of non-shelf
offshore waters, including submarine areas beyond shelf limits.
Article 2 grants to the coastal State "sovereign rights " of
an exclusive nature for the purpose of exploring and exploiting
the natural resources of the shelf.1 Moreover, such rights are
to pertain ipso jure to it, and are not to depend on an effective
or notional occupation, or any formal claims by way of pro-
clamation. The "natural resources" subject to these rights
include, in addition to the mineral and non-living resources of
the seabed and subsoil, sedentary organisms, that is to say,
organisms which, at the harvestable stage, either are immobile
on or under the seabed or are unable to move except in con-
stant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil? ". The
result was fundamentally to reverse previous rules, and to grant
to coastal States, without regard to the acquired rights of
fishing by non-coastal States, rights over sedentary fisheries
going far beyond the exceptional restricted rights over such
fisheries, mentioned above. A new and somewhat questionable
rule was created, making it unnecessary to treat such restricted
rights as a special exception to a general principle of freedom
of fishing in the high seas.
Other articles in the Convention provide inter alia:---

(a)
that the status of the superjacent waters as high seas, and the
status of the air space above such waters are unaffected;3

(b) that, subject to the coastal State's right to take reasonable
measures in exercise of the sovereign rights mentioned above,
the establishment or maintenance of submarine cables or pipe
lines on the shelf is not to be impeded; (c) that there is not to
be any" unjustifiable" interference with navigation, fishing, or
the conservation of the living resources of the sea, or any
* Quaere, whether the technique of deep sea mines, for the purpose of
  testing, etc. for oil presence is within the scope of Articles 1 and 2.

  not covered by the expression natural resources

  an area under United States territorial sovereignty.

interference with fundamental oceanographic or other scientific
research carried out with the intention of open publication;

(d) that necessary installations and devices, with surrounding
safety zones to a distance of 500 metres may be established in
shelf areas, provided that these are not to possess the status of
islands or to have a territorial sea of their own or to affect the
delimitation of the territorial sea of the coastal State, and are not
(nor are the safety zones) to be established where interference
may be caused to the use of recognised sea lanes essential to
international navigation; (e) that due notice of construction,
and permanent means of warning must be given of such installa-
tions; (f) that the coastal State is to retain unimpaired its right
to exploit the subsoil by means of tunnelling irrespective of the
depth of the water above the subsoil.1
Division of a Common Continental Shelf
Article 6 of the Convention on the Continental Shelf, which
provides for the manner of division of a shelf common to
States with opposite coastlines (_see_ paragraph 1), or common to
States adjacent to each other (_see_ paragraph 2), calls for particu-
lar mention. "In the absence of agreement, and unless another
boundary line is justified by special circumstances ", para-
graph 1 lays down that the median line is to be the boundary in
the former case, while, in the latter case, paragraph 2 applies
the principle of equidistance from the nearest points of the
territorial sea baselines. The International Court of Justice
held in the North Sea Continental Shelf Cases that in respect
to the division of the common shelf of the German Federal
Republic, the Netherlands, and Denmark, paragraph 2 was not
binding upon the German Federal Republic, a non-party to the
Convention, inasmuch as:---

(a) that country had not accepted
the rule in paragraph 2 in the manifest manner required for
provisions in a multilateral Convention to bind a non-party •
1 Article 13 of the Convention provides that after five years from the entry into
force of the Convention, a request for its revision may be made by any party,
and the General Assembly shall decide upon the steps, if any, to be taken in
respect of such request.

to that instrument; and (b) the equidistance principle had not
through its application by a certain number of countries become
thereby a settled rule of customary international law, in the
absence of evidence that in applying it those countries had
considered that they were legally bound to follow (_opinio
juris sive necessitatis_)". The Court also ruled that, in the
absence of the application to the instant cases of Article 6 of the
Convention, the governing principles of international law
concerning delimitation of a common continental shelf were
first, that such delimitation should be the object of agreement
between the countries specially concerned, and second, that
any arrangement for division should be arrived at in accordance
with " equitable principles".
It was in relation to the judicial determination of such" equit-
able principles" that the Court's judgment is of such additional
significance. According to the Court, it was in this connection
fundamental, above all, that the means for effecting the de-
limitation should be carried out in such a way as to be recognised
as equitable. Therefore, it ruled that the delimitation to be
made by agreement between the States concerned in the
instant cases should take account of all the relevant cir-
cumstances, in such a way as to leave, as much as possible, to
each party all those parts of the continental shelf that constituted
a natural prolongation of its land territory, without encroach-
ment on the natural prolongation of the land territory of the
other, provided that if there were any overlap, overlapping
areas were to be divided in agreed proportions, or failing
agreement, equally, unless they should decide on a régime of
joint jurisdiction, user or exploitation of the areas of overlap
(for example, if the same deposit of oil or source of gas should
lie on both sides of the line of division of the common shelf
area). The Court also declared that regard should be had to
the general configuration of the coasts of the parties, with
1 _See_ pp. 41--42, _ante_.
2 The unity of deposit criterion was adopted in the agreements concluded
by the parties for the purpose of giving effect to the Court's judgment, and
also in the Seabed Boundaries Demarcation Agreement of May 18, 1971,
between Australia and Indonesia (_see_ Article 7). For the Court's discussion of
this criterion, _see_ I.C.J. Reports, 1969, 3, at pp. 51--52.

provision for reasonable proportionality between shelf areas
allocated and the lengths of the corresponding coastlines.
In January, 1971, the parties entered into agreements for the
purpose of giving effect to the pronouncements of the Court.
Developments Since 1958 in the Law Concerning Coastal Waters,
and the Seabed and Ocean Floor
The two Geneva Conventions of 1958 mentioned above,
namely the Conventions on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous
Zone, and on the Continental Shelf, and the Convention on
Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High
Seas, together with the Geneva Convention on the High Seas?
adopted at the same Conference which drew up those instru-
ments, have been frequently referred to as constituting the
" Geneva settlement "
Assuming this description to be appropriate, the settlement
was nevertheless only a partial one, for the Geneva Con-
ference left unsettled four matters among others:---

(1) the
breadth of the territorial sea; (2) the question of innocent
passage for warships at all times through straits constituting an
international highway, and consisting wholly of territorial sea;

(3) the right of passage through, and overflight in relation to
the waters of archipelagoes; and (4) the question of protection
and conservation of maritime species for purely scientific or
tourist-amenity reasons. Nor was the settlement as a whole
acceptable to all States; instead of ratifying or acceding to all
four instruments en bloc, a number of States chose to become
party to one or some only, in a selective manner. Besides,
the exploitability criterion adopted in the Continental Shelf
Convention as marking the outer shelf limit was seen para-
doxically to be unsatisfactory from two opposing viewpoints.
On the one hand, advances since 1958 in the technology of
seabed exploration and exploitation, for example in drilling
for oil and gas, opened the way for activities in ocean depths
far beyond the limits envisaged at Geneva. On the other hand,
the
group of newly emerged States, technologically and
financially at a disadvantage in relation to developed countries,
_See_ Chapter 8, _post._, pp. 276--284.

------
Chap. 7.-State Territorial Sovereignty 231
became gravely concerned at the possibility that the exploita-
bility criterion might enable a small number of powerful
coastal States to monopolise the exploitation of the ocean floor
resources.
Another matter was that in March, 1967, a Liberian-registered
oil tanker, the Torrey Canyon, ran aground off the southernmost
coast of the United Kingdom, releasing about 100,000 tons of
crude oil which nearly had catastrophic effects upon adjacent
beaches. The result was to underscore boldly the deficiencies
of international maritime law, as the possible consequences of
a casualty affecting the new kind of giant oil tankers in common
use had not been clearly foreseen or provided against. Indeed
the dangers of such massive oil pollution prompted Canada
in 1970 to enact the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act,
providing for pollution zones in Arctic waters extending up to
100 miles offshore, and within which all vessels, Canadian and
foreign, were required to comply with prescribed standards
of construction and navigation safety, and to observe strict
obligations not to deposit waste; offending vessels might be
destroyed or removed, as the case might be, and even be seized
upon well-founded suspicion of a breach of the Act. The
United States protested against the Canadian legislation.
In 1967, a Maltese initiative, involving a plan for declaring
seabed resources beyond the continental shelf to be the com-
mon heritage of mankind, and to be developed in the interests
of all States, with special regard to developing countries, led to
far-reaching action within the framework of the United
Nations. The plan was designed not only to avoid an un-
controlled and unregulated scramble by developed States to
ravage the mineral wealth of the ocean floor, but also an arms
race which might lead ultimately to militarisation of the deep
seabed. In December, 1968, the United Nations General
Assembly adopted four resolutions relating to the matter, the
most important of which declared that the exploitation of the
seabed and ocean floor" beyond the limits of national juris-
diction" should be carried out for the benefit of mankind as a
whole, with the United Nations system as the focal point of
international co-operation in this domain, and established a
وو

------
232
Part 2.---States as Subjects of International Law
42-member Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Seabed and
Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction to make
recommendations upon the related questions.
In 1969--1971, progress in the direction contemplated by the
General Assembly resolutions was to a large extent activated
by this Seabed Committee. Further resolutions were adopted
by the General Assembly in 1969, after receiving the Com-
mittee's report, including a resolution declaring that pending
the establishment of an international régime in the seabed and
ocean floor area, all States and persons," physical or juridi-
cal" were bound to refrain from all activities of exploitation
of the resources of the area, and that no claim to any part of
the area or its resources was to be recognised.
Concurrently with the labours of the Seabed Committee,
consultations had been proceeding between the United States
and other States with a view to a general restructuring of the law
of the sea and of oceanic resources. In his special Foreign
Affairs Report to Congress on February 18, 1970, President
Nixon said:---" As man's use of the oceans grow, international
law must keep pace. The most pressing issue regarding the
law of the sea is the need to achieve agreement on the breadth
of the territorial sea, to head off the threat of escalating national
claims over the ocean." On the same day, in an address at
Philadelphia, the Legal Adviser to the Department of Statel
referred to the consultations with other States and to the general
subject of reform of the law of the sea, and also said:---" As
a result of our consultations we believe the time is right for the
conclusion of a new international treaty fixing the limitation
of the territorial sea at 12 miles, and providing for freedom of
transit through and over international straits and carefully
defined preferential fishing rights for coastal States on the high
seas."
A more radical step was taken on May 23, 1970, when
President Nixon issued a statement of a new United States
Policy on the Oceans; the Policy consisted of proposals that
States should by international agreement renounce their
sovereign rights in the seabed beyond the 200-metres limit,

State Press Release No. 49, February 18, 1970.

Chap. 7.-State Territorial Sovereignty 233
establish an international régime for the area beyond this limit,
authorise coastal States as Trustees for the international
community to carry out the major administrative role in
licensing the exploration and exploitation of natural resources
from the limit of the national jurisdiction of coastal States to
the edge of the " continental margin " and to share in the
international revenues from the International Trusteeship
Area which they administered, and to establish an international
organisation to perform functions similar to those of the
Trustee coastal States for the oceanic areas beyond the "con-
tinental margin". 1 On August 3, 1970, the United States
Government presented a Draft Convention, based upon these
proposals, to the above-mentioned Seabed Committee as a
working paper for discussion purposes. In later official
statements, the United States proposals have been explained
as providing for " equity" among all nations, coastal or non-
coastal, and shelf or non-shelf, while also serving to prevent a
process of "creeping jurisdiction whereby coastal States
gradually purport to assume sovereignty over waters above the
seabed.
The final result of these merging developments was the
adoption by the General Assembly of two important resolu-
tions on December 17, 1970, one consisting of a Declaration of
Principles Governing the Seabed and Ocean Floor and the
Subsoil Thereof beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, and
the other representing a decision to convene a new law of the
sea conference in 1973. The Declaration proclaims a number
of principles and guidelines, including the following among
others :---

(a) that the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil
thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, as well as
the resources of the area are the "common heritage of man-
kind"; (b) that the area is not subject to appropriation, or to
Department of State Bulletin, June 15, 1970, p. 737. The " continental
margin would consist of the continental shelf, continental slope, and con-
tinental rise, collectively, the outer limit being represented by the commence-
ment of the abyssal plain; _see_ pp. 224--225, _ante_.

ments thereon, _see_ Department of State Bulletin, August 24, 1970, pp. 209--218.

be the object of claims of sovereignty or sovereign rights by
States; (c) that all activities of exploration or exploitation in
the area are to be governed by an international régime to be
established; (d) that the area should be reserved exclusively
for peaceful purposes; and (e) that measures should be taken
in co-operation to prevent injury to the marine environment
and its ecological balance, to protect and conserve natural
resources of the area, and to prevent damage to the flora and
fauna. The terms of reference of the proposed Conference in
1973 are extremely wide, embracing the establishment of the
international régime for the area, a precise definition of the
area (i.e., of its shoreward limit), and" a broad range of related
issues including those concerning the régimes of the high seas,
the continental shelf, the territorial sea (including the question
of its breadth and the question of international straits) and
contiguous zone, fishing and conservation of the living re-
sources of the high seas (including the question of the preferen-
tial rights of coastal State), the preservation of the marine
environment (including, inter alia, the prevention of pollution)
and scientific research". This suggests in fact a complete
re-opening of the Geneva settlement, with no sanctity for any
of the four Geneva Conventions of 1958. The Seabed Com-
mittee was enlarged to an 86-member body, to serve as a
preparatory committee for the Conference.
It remains to be seen whether, in the light of advancing
technology, the concept of the "continental margin " (i.e.,
the collective representation of the continental shelf, the
continental slope, and the continental rise, bounded by the com-
mencement of the abyssal plain) can have value and utility for
the proposed new régime of the seabed and deep ocean floor.
Meanwhile, in the period 1969--1971, there have been con-
crete additions to the corpus of the law of the sea, apart from
the possibilities referred to above.
On November 29, 1969, two Conventions were adopted at
Brussels to deal with oil pollution casualties of the Torrey
Canyon genre (_see_ _ante_), namely the International Con-
vention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in cases of
Oil Pollution Casualties (which will be referred to as the Inter-

------
Chap. 7.-State Territorial Sovereignty 235
vention Convention), and the International Convention on
Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (to be referred to as
the Liability Convention). The Intervention Convention is of
limited scope, inasmuch as States parties are given certain rights
of taking defensive measures against pollution or threat of
pollution only " following" upon a maritime casualty or
acts related to such a casualty; there are no specific provisions
entitling coastal States to take preventive measures such as,
for example, fixing sealanes or subjecting tankers to surveillance
from shore-based stations, although States would not be de-
barred from making preparations beforehand to take such
defensive measures as might conceivably become necessary in
the event of a maritime casualty. In any event, the self-
defensive measures are to be proportionate to the actual or
threatened damage, while there are mandatory requirements
for consultation with other States affected. The Liability
Convention applies exclusively to "pollution damage caused
on the territory including the territorial sea " of the coastal
State. The tanker-owner is subjected to a principle of ab-
solute liability, rather than liability based upon fault, but such
absolute liability is one of a qualified character, for no liability
for pollution damage attaches to the owner if he proves (the
onus of proof presumably being upon him) that the damage:---


(a) resulted from war, hostilities, civil war, insurrection or some
unavoidable natural phenomenon; or (b) was caused by an
act or omission with intent to cause damage by a third party;
or (C) was wholly caused by the negligence or wrongful act of a
Government or authority responsible for maintaining lights
or providing navigational aids. A limit for liability is fixed,
and fault comes into account to the extent that if the casualty
occurred as a result of the owner's actual "fault or privity",
his liability is not restricted to the ceiling fixed by the Con-
vention. Provision is made for the necessity of certificates of
insurance or financial security where a tanker registered in a
country party to the Convention carries more than 2,000 tons
of oil in bulk as cargo.
An instrument of a different nature is the Treaty on the
Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and

------
236
Part 2.-States as Subjects of International Law
Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Seabed and Ocean
Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof, opened for signature on
February 10, 1971. For the sake of brevity, this will be
referred to as the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. It represents
a first major step in preventing militarisation of the seabed and
ocean floor. Under paragraph 1 of Article 1 parties are
prohibited from placing nuclear weapons or other weapons of
mass destruction on the seabed and ocean floor beyond the
limits of a twelve-miles coastal seabed zone, while paragraph 2
provides that this obligation is to apply also to the twelve-
miles zone, except that within that zone the undertaking is not
to apply either to the coastal State itself, or to the seabed
beneath the coastal State's territorial sea. In other articles,
provision is made for processes of verification, and for the
continuance of negotiations for wider measures to prevent
militarisation. The Seabed Arms Control Treaty is an arms
control measure, and therefore does not prohibit or limit the
use of peaceful nuclear explosive devices in the seabed or ocean
floor in order to obtain minerals, or to drill for oil and gas.
This consideration must be taken into account when assessing
claims that the Treaty has made a decisive contribution to the
protection of the marine environment.
Canals
Canals which are inland waterways are part of the territory
of the territorial States through which they pass, and by
analogy are subject to the rules as to rivers.
As to interoceanic canals, special treaty rules are or have
been applicable to the Suez, Panama and Kiel Canals. The
Suez Canal was to some extent neutralised and demilitarised
by the Convention of Constantinople of 1888, under which it
was to be freely open in time of peacel as well as of war to
merchant vessels and warships of all nations. It was not to be
1 In September, 1951, the United Nations Security Council affirmed the
principle of freedom of transit through the Suez Canal under this Convention
by adopting a Resolution calling upon Egypt to terminate certain restrictive
practices in respect to shipping passing through the Canal, which were designed
by Egypt to operate as a "blockade " of the ports of Israel. From the
comments of certain delegates, it appeared that the Constantinople Convention
was regarded as dedicating an international maritime highway.

------
Chap. 7.---State Territorial Sovereignty 237
blockaded, and in time of war no act of hostility was to be
allowed either in the canal itself or within three sea miles from
its ports. These provisions could not, and did not in practice
preclude a strong naval power, such as Great Britain, in time
of war, from blocking access for enemy vessels to the Canal
beyond the limit of three sea miles. Men-of-war were to pass
through the Canal without delay, not staying longer than 24
hours in Port Said and Suez. Troops, munitions, and other
war material were not to be shipped or unshipped inside the
Canal or in its harbours, and no permanent fortifications were
allowed in it, or the stationing of men-of-war. Subject to
the provisions of the 1888 Convention, the Canal is territorially
part of Egypt.
In 1956, Egypt purported to nationalise the Suez Canal Com-
pany which enjoyed a concession to operate the Canal. It
thereupon became a vital question, as to what extent the free
rights of States to use the Canal might be subject to impairment
in the future. In ultimate analysis, this issue lay at the root
of the Anglo-French intervention against Egypt in the Canal
zone, in October-November, 1956.
There is an opinion of some weight to the effect that the rights
to use the Canal are not dependent on the former concession,
nor exercisable only on sufferance by Egypt, but are vested
rights of an international character, guaranteed by international
law. Reference may be made, apart from the 1888 Convention,
to the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of October 19, 1954, under
which the parties recognised that the Canal was " a waterway
economically, commercially and strategically of international
importance ", and to the principles approved by the United
Nations Security Council on October 13, 1956---among them,
that freedom of passage should be maintained " without dis-
crimination, overtor covert ", that the Canal should be
' insulated " from the politics of any country, and that tolls
and charges should be fixed by agreement. Egypt's Declara-
tion of April 24, 1957,1 in which it affirmed that it would respect
1 For the text of the Declaration, _see_ American Journal of International
Law (1957), Vol. 51, pp. 673--675.

------
238 Part 2.---States as Subjects of International Law
the terms and spirit of the 1888 convention, has however, pre-
vented the issue from becoming clarified.
The Panama Canal comes under the operation of the Hay-
Pauncefote Treaty of 1901 between the United States and
Great Britain, and subsequent treaties between the United States
and Panama. The Hay-Pauncefote Treaty of 1901 contained an
Article providing that " the Canal shall be free and open to the
vessels of commerce and of war of all nations observing these
Rules, on terms of entire equality ".1 Although, strictly
speaking, binding only as between the contracting States, this
Article has been applied in practice by the United States to the
vessels of all maritime nations. As in the case of the Suez
Canal, it was provided by the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty that the
Panama Canal should not be blockaded nor any act of hostility
committed within it. In practice the treaty arrangements for
neutralisation did not prevent the United States taking the
necessary protective measures for the security of the Panama
Canal zone.
The United States enjoys under the Hay-Varilla Treaty,
signed on November 18, 1903, and repeatedly amended, occu-
pation and control over the Panama Canal zone in perpetuity,
although Panama claims the legal and nominal sovereignty.
_De facto_, however, the United States possesses certain sovereign
rights in the area, and this appears to be implicitly recognised
in the United States-Panama Treaty of Mutual Understanding
and Co-operation as to the Canal, of January 25, 1955 (_cf._ the
provision in the Treaty conceding to Panama the right to tax
non-American citizens working in the Canal zone). Although
there have from time to time been official references (e.g., the
joint statements on September 24, 1965)2 to the negotiation of
a new treaty in regard to the Canal, abrogating the 1903
Treaty, and acknowledging Panama's sovereignty over the
area of the Canal zone, with the Canal " open at all times to
1
Although it did not contain an express provision that the Panama Canal
should be open to all vessels in time of peace as well as of war. Ideally the
principle of non-discrimination should
apply to all canals which are inter-
national highways; and _cf._ Baxter, The Law of International Waterways
(1964), at p. 183.
2 Progress towards a new Treaty was also reported on October 19, 1971.

Chap. 7.-State Territorial Sovereignty 239
the vessels of all nations on a non-discriminatory basis ",
no such formal treaty has yet come into force.
The Kiel Canal was made freely open to the merchant
vessels and men-of-war of all nations under the Treaty of
Versailles of 1919, but in 1936 Germany denounced the rele-
vant provisions. No doubt freedom of passage will be
restored under the peace treaty, when it is made, with Germany.
In the Wimbledon Case, the Permanent Court of International
Justice held in respect of the Kiel Canal, and applying the
precedents of the Suez and Panama Canals, that the passage of a
belligerent warship through an interoceanic canal would not
compromise the neutrality of the riparian State.
3.-SERVITUDES
Under present practice, an international servitude? may be
defined as an exceptional restriction imposed by treaty on the
territorial sovereignty of a particular State whereby the territory
of that State is put under conditions or restrictions serving the
interests of another State, or non-State entity. A well-known
example is the condition that the frontier town of Hüningen
in Alsace should in the interests of the Swiss Canton of Basle
never be fortified.
Servitudes must be rights in rem, that is attached to the
territory under restriction, and involving something to be done
or something that the State bound by the servitude must
refrain from doing on that territory, for example, fishery rights
in the maritime belt, the right to build a railway through a
territory, the use of ports, rivers, and aerodromes, etc. Since
the right is one in rem, it follows that the servitude remains in
force whatever happens to the territory of the State bound by
the servitude; for example, if it be annexed or merged in
another State.

Law (2nd edition, 1958).

construction in adjacent Italian territory of new buildings that may overlook
the Vatican City).

------
240
Part 2.-States as Subjects of International Law
So far as Government practice is concerned, the doctrine of
international servitudes is relatively modern. In the North
Atlantic Coast Fisheries Arbitration (1910),1 the Permanent
Court of Arbitration stated that there was no evidence that
the doctrine was one with which either American or British
statesmen were conversant in 1818.
Servitudes were, however, frequently referred to in books
by writers on international law acquainted with the Roman
and Civil Law. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth
century, there was some evidence that Government advisers
were becoming more familiar with the notion, and in 1910
in the North Atlantic Coast Fisheries Arbitration the argument
was advanced that certain fishery rights granted to the United
States by Great Britain constituted a servitude, but the Permanent
Court of Arbitration refused to agree with this contention.
In a later case before the Permanent Court of International
Justice, namely The Wimbledon (1923), it was claimed that
the right of passage through the Kiel Canal was a State
servitude, but the majority of the Court did not accept this
contention, although it found favour with Judge Schücking.
In the Right of Passage over Indian Territory Case (1960), the
International Court of Justice gave recognition to a customary
right of passage for Portuguese private persons, civil officials,
and goods over Indian territory between Daman and certain
Portuguese enclaves, but inasmuch as it was held that such
right was not general, being inapplicable to armed forces, armed
police, and arms or ammunition, and was also subject to
regulation and control by India, the right was hardly a servitude
_stricto sensu_.
Initially, the doctrine of international servitudes was im-
ported from the private law, and many authorities are of
opinion that its translation to the international field has not
been a success. There are cogent grounds for suggesting that
the doctrine is not really a necessary one, and that international

Chap. 7.-State Territorial Sovereignty 241
law can quite well dispense with its application. This view
is at least supported by the rejection in the two cases mentioned
of particular claims to servitudes.
If the term "servitude " be inappropriate or legally inexact,
there ought nevertheless to be some convenient expression to
embrace the rights given to States under the numerous arrange-
ments of recent years for the granting of air, naval, or military
bases, or for the establishment of satellite, space vehicle or
missile tracking stations (for example the Exchange of Notes
at Washington of March 15, 1961, between the British and
United States Governments concerning the Establishment for
Scientific Purposes of a Space Vehicle Tracking and Com-
munications Station in Bermuda). Perhaps the expression
" territorial facilities " would be apt to cover these. In regard
to satellite and spacecraft tracking facilities, the point has been
raised whether the grantor State is bound to extend the benefit
of these to launching States other than the grantee State.
1 A matter of controversy is the extent to which such bases may be con-
trary to international law. This turns, inter alia, on the point whether
Article 51 of the U.N. Charter (" inherent right of individual or collective
self-defence" against armed attack) permits preparations and co-ordination
in the event that an armed attack should occur against one State member of
a collective defence grouping.
2 The word " facility" is in fact used, apparently in this sense, in Article 7
of the Treaty of January 27, 1967, on the Principles Governing the Activities
of States in the Exploration and use of Outer Space, including the Moon and
other Celestial Bodies (launching base of space objects).
