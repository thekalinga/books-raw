CHAPTER 6
RECOGNITION
1.-RECOGNITION IN GENERAL
The identity and number of States belonging to the international
community are by no means fixed and invariable. The march
of history produces many changes. Old States disappear or
unite with other States to form a new State, or disintegrate and
split into several new States, or former colonial or vassal
territories may by a process of emancipation themselves attain
to statehood. Then, also, even in the case of existing States,
revolutions occur or military conquests are effected, and the
status of the new Governments becomes a matter of concern
to other States, which formerly had relations with the displaced
Governments.
These transformations raise problems for the international
community, of which the paramount one is the matter of
recognition of the new State or new Government or other
change of status involved. At some time or other, this issue
of recognition has to be faced by other States, particularly
if diplomatic intercourse must necessarily be maintained with
the States or Governments to be recognised.
However, the subject is one of some difficulty, and at this
stage of the development of international law, can be presented
less as a collection of clearly defined rules or principles than
as a body of fluid, inconsistent, and unsystematic State practice.
The reasons for this are twofold:---


(a) Recognition is, as the practice of most States shows,
much more a question of policy than of law. The policy of
the recognising State is conditioned principally by the necessity
_See_ Chen, The International Law of Recognition (1951); Jean Charpentier,
La Reconnaissance Internationale et L'Evolution du Droit des Gens (Paris,
1956); Hans-Herbert Teuscher, Die Vorzeitige Anerkennung im Völkerrecht
(1959).

of protecting its own interests, which lie in maintaining proper
relations with any new State or new Government that is
likely to be stable and permanent. Besides this, other political
considerations, for example, trade, strategy, etc., may influence
a State in giving recognition. Consequently there is an
irresistible tendency in recognising States to use legal principles
as a convenient camouflage for political decisions.

(b) There are several distinct categories of recognition. At
the outset there are the categories already mentioned-the
recognition of new States, and the recognition of new Heads
or Governments of existing States. Although very much the
same principles are applicable to both, it is important that
they should not be confused. In addition to these two heads
of recognition, there are the recognition of entities as entitled
to the rights of belligerency, the recognition of entities entitled
to be considered as insurgent Governments, and the recognition
of territorial changes, new treaties, etc. (_see below_). Finally,
there is the distinction to bear in mind between recognition
_de jure_ and _de facto_ of States and Governments.
It is important that in considering the international law and
practice as to recognition, due allowance should be made for
the exigencies of diplomacy. States have frequently delayed,
refused, or eventually accorded recognition to newly-formed
States or Governments for reasons that lacked strict legal
justification. For example, in the First World War, Great
Britain, France, the United States, and other Powers recognised
Poland and Czechoslovakia before these latter actually existed
as independent States or Governments. Similarly, in the
pp. 77--80.
1 This conclusion is drawn by Professor H. A. Smith from a study of British
practice; _see_ Smith, Great Britain and the Law of Nations, Vol. 1 (1932), at
* Hence, it is necessary when referring to a particular act of recognition to
  be most specific in stating what the State, Government, or other entity is
  recognised as being. It is inadequate merely to state that some entity has
  been " recognised
  Among such considerations have been the following:---That the entity
  recognised could give valued help as a co-belligerent; that the entity recognised
  was willing to conclude a general settlement with the recognising State; that
  recognition or non-recognition might offend an ally,
  3

Part 2.---States as Subjects of International Law
Second World War the grant of recognition was conditioned
by the supreme necessity of strengthening the ranks in the
struggle against the Axis Powers, as for example in the case of
the recognition of the Governments-in-exile in London.
Political and diplomatic considerations also explain the
puzzling divergencies among States since 1948 so far as con-
cerned the recognition of the newly emerged State of Israel,
and of the People's Republic of China.
In form and in substance, recognition has continued to
remain primarily a unilateral diplomatic act on the part of one
or more States. No collective, organic procedure for granting
recognition based on established legal principles has yet been
evolved by the international community, although the provisions
in the United Nations Charter (Articles 3--4) directed to the
admission of States to membership of the Organisation may
incidentally amount to a certificate of statehood.
Accordingly, the recognition of a new State has been defined
with some authorityl as:---

the free act by which one or more States acknowledge
the existence on a definite territory of a human society politically
organised, independent of any other existing State, and capable
of observing the obligations of international law, and by which
they manifest therefore their intention to consider it a member
of the international community".
To express these two statements in another way, the State,
to be recognised, must possess the four characteristics mentioned
in the Montevideo Convention (_see above_, at p. 101), with
particular regard to the capacity to conduct its international
affairs, although the requirement of definiteness of territory is not
generally insisted upon (_cf._ the case of the recognition of Israel
in 1949, while its boundaries were still not finally determined).
Recognition as a Government, on the other hand, implies
that the recognised Government is, in the opinion of the
recognising State, qualified to represent an existing State.

in 1936, Article 1, American Journal of International Law (1936), Vol. 30,
Supplement, at p. 185.

Chap. 6.-Recognition
143
This act of recognition in both cases may be express, that
is by formal declaration (which may be by diplomatic Note,
note verbale, personal message from the head of State or Minister
of Foreign Affairs, parliamentary declaration, or treaty),
or implied when it is a matter of inference from certain relations
between the recognising State and the new State or new Govern-
ment. The manner of recognition is not material, provided
that it unequivocally indicates the intention of the recognising
State. There are no rules of international law restrictive of the
form or manner in which recognition may be accorded.
Recognition under modern State practice involves more
than cognition, that is to say more than an avowal of knowledge
that a State or Government possesses the requisite bare qualifi-
cations to be recognised. This is proved by the fact, inter alia,
that substantial delays may occur before a State or Government
is recognised, notwithstanding that its status may be beyond
doubt. The practical purpose of recognition, namely, the
initiation of formal relations with the recognising State, must
also always be borne in mind. Once granted, recognition
in a sense estops or precludes the recognising State from con-
testing the qualifications for recognition of the State or Govern-
ment recognised.
Many writers have, however, sought to draw wider theoretical
implications as to the object of recognition.
There are two principal theories as to the nature, function,
and effect of recognition:---


(a) According to the constitutive theory, it is the act of
recognition alone which creates statehood or which clothes a
new Government with any authority or status in the inter-
national sphere.

(b) According to the declaratory or evidentiary theory
statehood or the authority of a new Government exists as
such prior to and independently of recognition. The act of

that an otherwise ambiguous Note or note verbale constitutes formal recogni.
tion.

------
144 Part 2.---States as Subjects of International Law
recognition is merely a formal acknowledgment of an
established situation of fact.
Probably the truth lies somewhere between these two
theories. The one or the other theory may be applicable
to different sets of facts. The bulk of international practice
supports the evidentiary theory, inasmuch as while recognition
has often been given for political reasons and has tended
therefore to be constitutive in character, countries generally
seek to give or to refuse it in accordance with legal principles
and precedents. Also recognition has frequently been with-
held for political reasons' or until such time as it could be
given in exchange for some material diplomatic advantage to
be conceded by the newly recognised State or Government-
a clear indication that the latter already possessed the requisite
attributes of statehood or governmental authority. Moreover,
a mere refusal by a single State to recognise could not affect
the situation if a great number of other States had already
given their recognition. Nor have States in practice regarded
non-recognition as conclusive evidence of the absence of
qualifications to be a State or a Government. Indeed by
insisting that unrecognised States or Governments must observe
the rules of international law, they have implicitly acknow-
ledged that they possess some status as such.
The evidentiary theory is further supported by the following
rules :

(a) The rule that if a question arises in the Courts of a
new State as to the date at which the State came into existence,
it will be irrelevant to consider the date when treaties with
other States recognising it came into operation. The date
when the requirements of statehood were in fact first fulfilled
is the only material date. 2

(b) The rule that recognition of a new State has retroactive

  1948:---" The political existence of the State is independent of recognition by
  other States".

effect, dating back to its actual inception as an independent
State. 1
These two rules which apply also to newly recognised
Governments are based principally on the necessary considera-
tion that there should be no gap of time during which a State
or Government is out of existence. In other words, continuity
is the essence of State sovereignty or of governmental authority.
Otherwise, many transactions, contracts, changes of status,
etc., of the utmost importance to private citizens, would be
null and void because made in a period when the laws of the
particular State or Government under which they were effected
were unrecognised.
The constitutive theory finds some support in the fact that
only upon recognition does the recognised State or Govern-
ment acquire any status, as such, in the municipal Courts of
the recognising State.2
Is there a duty to grant recognition?
It has been urged that States are subject to a duty under
international law to recognise a new State or a new Government
fulfilling the legal requirements of statehood or of govern-
mental capacity. However, the existence of such a duty is
1 Aksionairnoye Obschestvo A. M. Luther v. Sagor (James) & Co., (1921)
3 K.B. 532; and as to the retroactive effect of recognition, _see_ further below
in this Chapter, pp. 164--165. A further authority against the constitutive
theory is the Tinoco Arbitration (1923) where the Arbitrator held that the
revolutionary Tinoco Government of Costa Rica which came into power in
1917 was a properly constituted Government, although not recognised by
Great Britain, and that Great Britain was not estopped (i.e., precluded in
law) by such prior non-recognition from later alleging that the Government
was in fact a duly and properly constituted one; _see_ United Nations Reports
of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. I, pp. 371 _et seq._
? _See below_ at pp. 159--161.
* In observations forwarded to the United Nations in 1948 on the Draft
  Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States (_see above_, pp. 92--93), the
  British Government stated that it favoured a development of international
  law under which recognition would become a matter of legal duty for all
  States in respect to entities fulfilling the conditions of statehood, etc.

------
146 Part 2.--States as Subjects of International Law
not borne out by the weight of precedents and practice, particu-
larly the divergencies since 1949 in the recognition of the People's
Republic of China, although it could perhaps be said that in
recognising certain newly emerged States (i.e., decolonised
territories or emancipated trust territories) some States con-
sidered that they were bound to accord recognition.
If indeed there were such a legal duty to recognise, it is
difficult to say by whom and in what manner it could be
enforced. To each duty, there must correspond a correlative
right, and how would one define this right? Is it a right of the
State claiming to be recognised, or a right of the international
community, and how would such claims of right be presented ?
The answer to these questions must be that there is no general
acceptance of the existence of the duty or the right mentioned.
No right to recognition is laid down in the Draft Declaration
on the Rights and Duties of States, drawn up by the Inter-
national Law Commission in 1949. The action of States in
affording or withholding recognition is as yet uncontrolled
by any rigid rules of international law; on the contrary recog.
nition is treated, for the most part, as a matter of vital policy
that each State is entitled to decide for itself.1 Podesta Costa's
view that recognition is a " facultative " and not an obligatory
act is more consistent with the practice. There is not even a
duty on a State under international law to withdraw recognition
if the qualifications of statehood or of governmental authority
cease to exist. The apparent arbitrariness of State practice
in this regard is tempered by the consideration that most
States endeavour, as far as possible, to give recognition accord-
ing to legal principles and precedents, to the extent at least
that although they may withhold recognition for political
reasons, when they do grant it they generally make sure that
the State or Government to be recognised at least possesses
the requisite legal qualifications. To this degree States do
treat recognition as a legal act.
* Also municipal Courts have adopted the view that the decision to recognise
  is a political one, to be performed by the executive, and not to be questioned
  in a Court of law; _cf._ Oetjen v. Central Leather Company (1918), 246 U.S. 297.

Chap. 6.- Recognition
147
Implied Recognition
Implied recognition is very much a matter of the intention
of the State said to have given recognition. The implication
is made solely when the circumstances unequivocally indicate
the intention to establish formal relations with the new State
or new Government. Such clear-cut cases will naturally be
limited. There are other cases in which a State may lay itself
open to the inference of having recognised another State or
Government, for example, by entering into some form of
relations with it. Such conduct can usually amount to no
more than recognition _de facto_, or recognition of an entity as
an insurgent authority, or indicate an intention to maintain,
through agents, informal relations without recognition.
In practice, the only legitimate occasions for conclusively
implying recognition _de jure_ are:---


(1) The formal signature of a bilateral treaty by the recognised
and recognising States (for example, the Treaty of Commerce
between Nationalist China and the United States in 1928) as
distinct from mere temporary arrangements or agreements. It
is not necessary that the treaty be ratified.1

(2) The formal initiation of diplomatic relations between
the recognised and recognising State.

(3) The issue of a consular exequatur by the admitting State
for a consul of an unrecognised State.
In certain exceptional circumstances, but not otherwise, 2
recognition has been inferred from the following circumstances:

(a) Common participation in a multilateral treaty. How-
ever, States such as Great Britain and the United States have,
sometimes, when signing a Convention, declared that their
signature was not to be construed as the recognition of a
signatory or adhering Power not recognised by them.

(b) Participation in an international conference.
1 Republic of China v. Merchants' Fire Assurance Corporation of New York
(1929), 30 F. (20) 278.
Note, e.g. the Protocol to the Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos,
signed at Geneva on July 23, 1962. The United States, and the People's
Republic of China, not recognised by the United States, were both parties to
the Protocol.

------
148
Part 2.---States as Subjects of International Law

(c) Initiation of negotiations between a recognising and a
recognised State.
Recognition of the validity of the laws decreed or enacted
by a particular entity, does not necessarily import recognition
of the law-making entity.1
Recognition subject to a condition
Sometimes States are recognised subject to a condition,
generally an obligation which they undertake to fulfil. Thus,
the Berlin Congress of 1878 recognised Bulgaria, Montenegro,
Serbia, and Rumania, under the condition only that these
States should not impose any religious disabilities on any of
their subjects.
The effect of such conditional recognition is that failure to
fulfil the obligation does not annul the recognition, as once
given this is incapable of withdrawal. By breaking the
condition, the recognised State may be guilty of a breach of
international law, and it is open to the recognising States to
sever diplomatic relations as a form of sanction, or otherwise to
proceed. But the status which the recognised State has
obtained from the act of recognition cannot then be retracted.
By way of exception, however, the conditional recognition of
States or Governments which are just in process of emerging
is probably revocable. Thus the recognition in 1919 by Great
Britain of the Esthonian National Council " for the time being
provisionally and with all necessary reservations as to the
future "2 was no doubt revocable in the sense that it did not
constitute an undertaking to continue the recognition if con-
ditions altered.
In this topic of conditional recognition, the term "condition"
is thus not used in its true legal connotation as a vital term
going to the root of a legal act, so that if the term be not
performed such act becomes void or inoperative.
In practice States have repeatedly, as consideration for the
grant of recognition, exacted from States or Governments to
Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung v. Rayner and Keeler, Ltd. (No. 2), (1967] 1 A.C.
853, at p. 961; [1966] 2 All E.R. 536, at p. 581.

be recognised some guarantee or undertaking or stipulation
(for example, respect for private property as in the case of the
United States recognition in 1937 of the new Bolivian Govern-
ment). This practice is consistent with the predominantly
political character of the unilateral act of recognition. It is
true, however, that if recognition should under international
law become purely and simply the cognitive act of registering
the existence of statehood or of governmental capacity, logically
it could not be subject to any such extrinsic term or condition.
Collective Recognition
The advantages of recognition taking place by some collective
international act, or through the medium of an international
institution cannot be denied. It would obviate the present
embarrassments due to unilateral acts of recognition.1
In the light of the Advisory Opinion of the International
Court of Justice, on Conditions of Membership in the United
Nations, which recognises statehood as a primary qualification
for admission to the United Nations, it is clear that such
admission is tantamount to recognition of the Member admitted
as a State.3
1 There are a number of historical precedents of collective recognition;
e.g., the recognition of Bulgaria, Montenegro, Serbia and Rumania by the
Berlin Congress of 1878, and of Esthonia and Albania by the Allied Powers
in 1921.
2 I.C.J. Reports (1948), at pp. 57 _et seq._
3 As distinct from the admission of a new Member State to the United
Nations, there is the question of the acceptance of the credentials of the
Government of an existing Member State. Quaere whether accepting within
the United Nations the credentials of a revolutionary Government of a
Member State involves the same considerations as the recognition of that
Government. In a memorandum circulated to the Security Council members
on March 8, 1950, the Secretary-General adopted the view that the
two matters rested on different considerations. In this connection, _see_
D. I. Feldman, Soviet Year Book of International Law, 1961, pp. 50--64.
A stage may be reached where, unless the credentials of the effective Govern-
ment are accepted in the same manner as it has been recognised, the Member
State concerned will for all practical purposes be denied its due right of par-
ticipating in the Organisation. The matter had been raised repeatedly from
1950 onwards in connection with the claim by the Soviet Government and
other Governments of Member States that the Nationalist Government of
China could no longer represent China within the United Nations, but that
the credentials of the Government of the Communist People's Republic of
China, which had been recognised by a number of States, should for that and
other reasons be accepted. While ultimately, in 1971, support was obtained
for acceptance of the latter Government's credentials, controversy centred on
the point whether the former Government should remain a Member.

------
150
Part 2.-States as Subjects of International Law
Recognition of a Head of State or of a new Government
As pointed out above, this has nothing to do with the recog-
nition of a State itself. According to one American
authority?:---

The granting or refusal of recognition (of a Government)
has nothing to do with the recognition of the State itself. If
a foreign State refuses the recognition of a change in the form
of government of an old State, this latter does not thereby
lose its recognition as an international person ".
In the case of existing States, no difficulty arises except
when changes in the headship of the State or of its Government
take place in an abnormal or revolutionary manner.
Where the change proceeds in a formal and constitutional
way, recognition by other States is purely a matter of formality.
But in the case of a revolution the recognition of the revolu-
tionary Government is a serious question and a decision thereon
is only made with great care. It is practically impossible to
lay down any definite legal principles on the matter, so
materially do political considerations usually impinge thereon,
while the practice is, as may be expected, confused and con-
flicting. The recognising Government should at least be
satisfied as to the prospects of stability of the new Government.
Although the premature recognition of a revolutionary Govern-
ment may justifiably be treated by the legitimate Government
as an unfriendly act, it is questionable in the light of modern
practice whether, in the absence of some display of force or
threat of force by the recognising State towards the legitimate
Government, this can amount to a breach of international law
(for example, an intervention). 2
In the case of nascent States, recognition raises many problems
for the recognising States; first, because of the merging of the
1
Lehigh Valley Railroad Co. v. The State of Russia (1927), 21 F. (20) 396.
? A historical instance of premature recognition which wasi n fact treated
as an intervention was that of the recognition by France in 1778 of the United
States Government. The weight of subsequent practice, leaning in favour of
the claims of revolutionary Governments commanding popular support, has
tended to discount the view that any diplomatic assistance to such Governments
may represent an intervention. In 1968--1969, during the course of the
Nigerian Civil War, it was claimed that the recognition of the Biafran Govern-
ment might constitute an intervention.

151
new State with its new Government and the difficulty of
recognising the one without recognising the other; secondly,
most States prefer, in the matter of recognition of nascent
States, to be as non-committal as possible and to preface the
date of recognition _de jure_ by a stage of recognition _de facto_.
There is no difficulty, of course, where the new State is a
former dependency or trust territory, and the parent or tutelary
State, itself already _de jure_ recognised, has consented to emanci-
pation. Recognition can be accorded automatically, and is
essentially then a legal act of a cognitive nature. This is
indeed what happened in the case of the recognition of the
large number of African and Asian States, which have emerged
since the end of the Second World War.
Withdrawal of Recognition
As a rule, recognition _de jure_ once given is irrevocable.
This holds true even though recognition was given in the first
instance from purely political motives to indicate to the world
at large that relations with the recognised State or Government
are being initiated. It is a paradox that when a gesture is
made in a contrary sense, indicating that no further relations
will be maintained with the formerly recognised State or
-Government, it is not in general attended by a withdrawal of
recognition. A formal severance of diplomatic relations may
be declared, but the once recognised State or Government does
not otherwise lose its status in the international community.
Thus, Great Britain recognised the Soviet Government _de jure_
in 1924, but later broke off relations in 1927, and although
relations were subsequently resumed, participated in the
vote of 1939 expelling the Soviet Union from the League of
Nations. Neither the rupture of diplomatic relations nor the
act of expulsion annulled recognition of the Soviet Government.
Sometimes a refusal to recognise is virtually equivalent to
a state of severance of diplomatic relations. This is particu-
larly well illustrated by the attitude of the United States of
non-recognition of the Soviet Government before November,
1933, when recognition was given. A communication of

------
152
Part 2.-States as Subjects of International Law
the United States Department of State to the New York
Court of Appeals in 1933 characteristically defined this
attitudel:
"The Department of State is cognisant of the fact that the
Soviet regime is exercising control and power in territory of
the former Russian Empire and the Department of State has
no disposition to ignore that fact.
The refusal of the Government of the United States to accord
recognition to the Soviet regime is not based on the ground
that the regime does not exercise control and authority
in territory of the former Russian Empire, but on other
facts".
Of similar significance is the current refusal (since 1949) of the
United States to extend recognition to the Government of the
Communist People's Republic of China.
Non-recognition of a new State or new Government does
not mean non-intercourse with non-recognising States, just as
non-intercourse does not necessarily signify non-recognition.
For instance, the British Government has in practice never
declined to have talks or to transact necessary business with the
agents or Ministers of unrecognised States or Governments,
as witness the discussions with the Rhodesian Government
after its unilateral declaration of independence, although it
has been made plain that such informal relations or non-
committal exchanges did not in any sense amount to formal
diplomatic intercourse. Thus frequently consular appoint-
ments have been made to such unrecognised communities,
although care has been taken to express the appointments in
such a way as not to involve even _de facto_ recognition.3 In
1 Salimoff & Co. v. Standard Oil Co. of New York (1933), 262 N.Y. 220
2 In Compania de Transportes Mar Caribe, S.A. v. M/T Mar Caribe (1961),
American Journal of International Law (1961), Vol. 55, p. 749, a United States
District Court appears to have treated the rupture of diplomatic relations
with Cuba by the United States on January 3, 1961, as a withdrawal of
recognition.
3 _See_ Smith, Great Britain and the Law of Nations (1932), Vol. I, at p. 79.
In 1949, Great Britain intimated to the newly formed Government of the Com-
munist People's Republic of China that it was ready to conduct informal
relations with authorities of that Government through British consular officers,
while stopping short of _de facto_ recognition (_see_ Civil Air Transport Incorporated
v. Central Air Transport Corporation, (1953) A.C. 70, at pp. 88--89).

153
the opinion of the International Law Commission in 1967,1
a State may send a special mission to, or receive a special
mission from, a State not recognised by it. Perhaps, the most
significant recent example is the fact that on a large number of
occasions since 1949 the United States has participated in
discussions or negotiations with the Communist People's
Republic of China, including the series of exchanges and contacts
in Warsaw since 1955, although refusing to grant formal
recognition. One may wonder whether this constitutes a
tertium quid, in addition to recognition _de jure_ and _de facto_
(_see_ _post._)---that is, a kind of non-formal tacit acceptance.
2.- RECOGNITION DE JURE AND DE FACTO
The practice of States draws a distinction between recog-
nition _de jure_ and _de facto_.
Recognition _de jure_ means that according to the recognising
State, the State or Government recognised formally fulfils
the requirements laid down by international law for effective
participation in the international community.
Recognition _de facto_ means that in the opinion of the
recognising State, provisionally and temporarily and with all
due reservations for the future, the State or Government
recognised fulfils the above requirements in fact (_de facto_).
In modern times, the practice has generally been to preface
the stage of _de jure_ recognition by a period of _de facto_
recognition, particularly in the case of a legally constituted
government giving way to a revolutionary regime. In such
a case, _de facto_ recognition is purely a non-committal formula
whereby the recognising State acknowledges that there is a
legal _de jure_ government which" ought to possess the powers of
sovereignty, though at the time it may be deprived of them ",
1 _See_ paragraph 2 of draft Article 7 of the Commission's Draft of Articles
on Special Missions, and commentary thereon, in the Report of the Commis-
sion on the Work of its Nineteenth Session (1967). Article 7 of the Conven-
tion on Special Missions, opened for signature on December 16, 1969, merely
provides that the existence of diplomatic or consular relations is not necessary
for the sending or reception of a special mission, paragraph 2 of draft
Article 7 having been omitted.

------
154 Part 2.States as Subjects of International Law
but that there is a _de facto_ government " which is really in
possession of them, although the possession may be wrongful
or precarious". 1 Meanwhile _de facto_ recognition secures
considerable economic advantages to the recognising State,
enabling it to protect the interests of its citizens in the territory
of that State or Government. At a later stage, when the need
for reservations no longer exists because the future of the
new State or new regime is completely assured, _de jure_
recognition is formally given.
If there be conclusive evidence of continuing _de jure_ recog-
nition, a Court is not entitled to find that there has been
_de facto_ recognition, even of an entity subordinate to the
_de jure_ recognised Government.2
Where a Court sitting in a particular territory has to deter-
mine the status of a new Government which has illegally
assumed control of that territory, there can be no question of
recognition _de jure_ of the legitimate Government and of
recognition _de facto_, at the same time, of the new Government.
The Court will have to decide, not merely whether the usurping
regime is an established _de facto_ Government, but whether it is
a lawful Government at all.3
The point may be raised whether the jus of _de jure_ recogni-
tion means:---

(a) State law, (b) international law, or (c) abstract
justice, in the sense of "right". Ideally, it should mean
international law, which in this regard should be guided by

(c)-abstract justice---and should condition (a)---State law.
Unfortunately, State practice falls far short of such standards,
and the words _de jure_ signify little more than the observation
of legal or traditional forms in giving recognition, and a

recognition has been guided by a reasonably consistent policy
based on precedent. To quote Professor H. A. Smith?:---

... The normal policy of this country for over a hundred
years has been to insist upon certain conditions as a precedent
to the grant of _de jure_ recognition of a new State or a new
Government. We have required, first, a reasonable assurance
of stability and permanence. Secondly, we have demanded
evidence to show that the Government commands the general
support of the population. Thirdly, we have insisted that it
shall prove itself both able and willing to fulfil its international
obligations ".
As to _de facto_ recognition, it is misleading to regard this
as always tentative or revocable; more generally it is simply a
convenient prelude to the more formal and more permanent
type of recognition--recognition _de jure_
_de jure_. Both types of
recognition presuppose effective governmental control in fact.2
To take illustrations from British practice, the Soviet Govern-
ment was _de facto_ recognised on March 16, 1921, but only _de
jure_ on February 1, 1924. In 1936, Great Britain _de facto_
recognised the Italian conquest of Abyssinia, and in 1938 _de
jure_ recognised Italy's sovereignty over that region. Also
Great Britain _de facto_ recognised the progressive occupation
of different parts of Spain by the insurgent forces in the course
of the Spanish Civil War, 1936--1938, until finally _de jure_
recognition was given to the Franco Government after all
Spanish territory had been won over.
So far as concerns the legal incidents of recognition, there
are few differences in English law between _de facto_ and _de
jure_ recognition.
The _de facto_ recognition by Great Britain of a foreign
government is as conclusively binding, while it lasts, upon an
English Court as _de jure_ recognition, for the reasons stated
1 _See_ Smith, Great Britain and the Law of Nations (1932), Vol. I, at p. 239.
U.S. practice is to a similar effect; _see_ M, M. Whiteman, Digest of International

by Warrington, L.J., in Aksionairnoye Obschestvo A. M.
Luther v. Sagor (James) and Co.1
" In the latter case, as well as in the former, the Government
in question acquires the right to be treated by the recognising
State as an independent sovereign State, and none the less
that our Government does not pretend to express any opinion
on the legality or otherwise of the means by which its power
has been obtained".
It follows also that the act of recognition _de facto_ has retro-
active operation exactly as in the case of recognition _de jure_.
Moreover, transactions between a British subject and the
Government of a foreign State which has received _de facto_
recognition from Great Britain are binding on that foreign
State and cannot be repudiated by a subsequent Government
which has overthrown its predecessor by force.2
One material difference is that it is not the practice of the
British Crown to receive as properly accredited diplomatic
envoys, representatives of States which have not been recog-
nised _de jure_.
A conflict of authority between a displaced _de jure_ Govern-
ment and a newly recognised _de facto_ Government may often
arise. In such an event, an English Court of law adopts the
view that so far as concerns matters in the territory ruled by the
_de facto_ Government, the rights and status of the _de facto_
Government prevail. This rule would seem to follow from two
notable cases, Bank of Ethiopia v. National Bank of Egypt and
Liguori,3 decided by Clauson, J., and the Arantzazu Mendi,4
decided by the House of Lords. The former decision arose out
of the situation created by the Italian conquest of Abyssinia in
1936. After the Italian Government had been recognised _de
      facto_, it enacted certain laws which were in conflict with those
      issued by the exiled Emperor of Abyssinia---the _de jure_ ruler

      although a State is recognised only _de facto_ as having authority over a particular
      area of territory, it is to be treated as having full jurisdiction over persons within
      that area ; _see_ R. v. Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex parte Schtraks, (1963] 1 Q. B.

who had been forced to flee from his conquered country.
Clauson, J., held that as the authority of the _de jure_ ruler
was merely theoretical and incapable of being enforced,
whereas actually the Italian Government was in control of
Abyssinian territory and _de facto_ recognised, effect must
be given to the laws of this Government over those of the _de
jure_ monarch.
The case of the Arantzazu Mendi involved a conflict of rights
between the legitimate and the insurgent Governments in
Spain during the Spanish Civil War, 1936--1938, at a period
when the insurgents had won over the greater part of Spanish
territory. At this stage Great Britain continued to recognise
the Republican Government as the _de jure_ Government of
Spain, but also recognised the insurgent administration as the
_de facto_ Government of that portion of Spain occupied by it.
Proceedings were initiated in the British Admiralty Court by
the _de jure_ Government against the _de facto_ Government to
recover possession of a certain ship, and the latter Government
claimed the usual immunity from suit accorded to a fully
sovereign State. The ship was registered in a port under the
control of the _de facto_ Government, and had been handed
over to that Government in England pursuant to a requisition
decree issued by it. It was held that the writ must be set aside
as the insurgent (or Nationalist) Government was a sovereign
State and was entitled to immunity. The argument put forward
on behalf of the _de jure_ Government that the insurgent
administration was not a sovereign State, since it did not occupy
the whole of Spain, was rejected.
The decision in the Arantzazu Mendi has not escaped
criticism, particularly on the ground that in such circumstances
the concession of jurisdictional immunity to a _de facto_ Govern-
ment without full sovereignty goes too far. Properly con-
sidered, however, the case is merely a logical extension of the
principles laid down in Aksionairnoye Obschestvo A. M. Luther
66
* Counsel in Civil Air Transport Incorporated v. Central Air Transport
  Corporation, (1953) A.C. 70, at p. 75, described the decision as the high-water
  mark of recognition of jurisdictional immunity in the case of _de facto_
  sovereignty".

v. Sagor (James) & Co. and in Bank of Ethiopia v. National
Bank of Egypt.1 Taken together, the effect of the three decisions
was virtually to erase a number of suggested distinctions
between _de jure_ and _de facto_ recognition, so far as the municipal
law effects of each are concerned.
None the less, recognition _de facto_ may have a substantial
function to perform in the field of international law. In this
regard, its difference from recognition _de jure_ is not merely
one of a political character. By recognising a State or Govern-
ment _de facto_, the recognising State is enabled to acknowledge
the external facts of political power, and protect its interests,
its trade, and citizens, without committing itself to condoning
illegalitites or irregularities in the emergence of the _de facto_
State or Government. To this extent recognition _de facto_
is probably a necessary legal expedient.
Besides there are these important differences between _de
jure_ and _de facto_ recognition which render the distinction one
of substance:---

(a) only the _de jure_ recognised State or Govern-
ment can claim to receive property locally situated in the
territory of the recognising State;2 (b) only the _de jure_ recog-
nised State can represent the old State for purposes of State
succession, or in regard to espousing any claim of a national of
that State for injury done by the recognising State in breach of
international law; (c) the representatives of entities recognised
only _de facto_ are not entitled to full diplomatic immunities and
privileges;3 (d) _de facto_ recognition can, in principle, owing to
its provisional character, be withdrawn on several grounds
other than those normally justifying a withdrawal of _de jure_
recognition; and (e) if a sovereign State, _de jure_ recognised,

3.--LEGAL EFFECTS OF RECOGNITION
Recognition produces legal consequences affecting the rights,
powers, and privileges of the recognised State or Government
both at international law and under the municipal law of
States which have given it recognition. Also, when the subject
of recognition arises for examination, however incidentally,
by the municipal Courts of such States, various problems of
evidence, legal interpretation and procedure enter into con-
sideration.
Here it is important to bear in mind the limits between
international law and State law. Recognition confers on the
recognised State or Government a status under both inter-
national law and municipal law. In this section, we shall
first deal with the status under municipal law, and accordingly
will examine for this purpose the law and practice applied by
Anglo-American Courts.
The capacity of a recognised State or Government may be
considered from a negative aspect, by ascertaining the particular
disabilities of one which is unrecognised. The principal legal

853, at p. 906; (1966) 2 All E.R. 536, at p. 547.
2 There may, however, be other matters besides disabilities. One illustration
is that of questions of nationality; e.g., if a State is annexed by an unrecog-
nised State, nationals of the annexed State will, in the municipal Courts of a
non-recognising country, be deemed to retain their citizenship. Acts or
transactions, necessary to peace and good order among citizens ", e.g.,
marriages duly performed or transfers properly registered, and therefore not
relevant to any question of power or disability of a State or Government, may
be valid notwithstanding the absence of recognition, the principle being that
there should be no interruption of the administration of law and justice; _see_
Grotius, __De Jure_ Belli ac Pacis_, Book I Chapter IV, s. xv. 1, Texas v. White

disabilities of an unrecognised State or Government may be
enumerated as follows:---


(a) It cannot sue in the Courts of a State which has not
recognised it. The principle underlying this rule was well
expressed in one American casel:---

"... A foreign power brings an action in our Courts not
as a matter of right. Its power to do so is the creature of
comity. Until such Government is recognised by the United
States, no such comity exists ".

(b) By reason of the same principle, the acts of an un-
recognised State or Government will not generally be given in
the Courts of a non-recognising State the effect customary
according to the rules of "comity".

(C) Its representatives cannot claim immunity from legal
process.

(d) Property due to a State whose Government is un-
recognised may actually be recovered by the representatives
of the regime which has been overthrown.
Recognition transmutes these disabilities into the full status
of a sovereign State or Government. Accordingly, the newly
recognised State or Government:


(i) acquires the right of suing in the Courts of Law of the
recognising State;

(ii) may have effect given by these Courts to its legislative
and executive acts both past and future;

(iii) may claim immunity from suit in regard to its property
and its diplomatic representatives;

(iv) becomes entitled to demand and receive possession of, or
to dispose of property situate within the jurisdiction of a
recognising State which formerly belonged to a preceding
Government.
1 _See_ Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic v. Cibrario (New York
Court of Appeals), 235 N.Y. 255 (1923). _Semble_, however, an unrecognised
Government if truly exercising complete authority, cannot be sued in an
American municipal Court, inasmuch as it is to be regarded as a sovereign
Government (Wulfsohn v. R.S.F.S.R. (1923), 234 N.Y. 372). _Cf._ United
States v. New York Trust Co. (1946), 75 F. Supp. 583, at p. 587.

Chap. 6.- Recognition
161
At international law, the status of a recognised State or
Government carries with it the full privileges of membership
of the international community. Thus it acquires the capacity
to enter into diplomatic relations with other States and to
conclude treaties with them. Also, such other States become
subject to various obligations under international law in relation
to the newly recognised State or Government, which in its turn
incurs similar reciprocal obligations. Upon it, therefore, as
from the date of recognition, fall both the burden and bounty
of international law.
Recognition in the Courts of Law
The rule in British countries and in the United States is
that though the existence of a new State or a new Government
is merely a question of fact, it is one involving important
political considerations and is therefore primarily to be deter-
mined by the political and not by the judicial organs of the State.
Accordingly, on a question of recognition, the Court is entitled
to consult the Executive on the principle that it must act in
unison with the " will of the national sovereignty", which is
expressed in external affairs through the Executive alone. To
hold otherwise might lead to a conflict between the Courts
and the Executive at the expense of national interests; for
example, if a Government recognised only by the Courts of a
particular State and not by the Executive could thereby recover
in that State property which it was contrary to national policy
to hand over.
Considerations of evidentiary convenience have also con-
ditioned this principle of consultation of the Executive.
According to Lord Sumner in Duff Development Co. v.
Kelantan Government, 1 British Courts act on the best evidence
available, and the best evidence in
the best evidence in this regard is a
statement by the appropriate Secretary of State
behalf of the Crown.? This is so even if the statement purports
to set out facts which in principle ought to be attested by the

Part 2.-States as Subjects of International Law
British Government in conjunction with other Governments
concerned, or interested. It is not the business of the Court
to inquire whether a particular Department of State rightly
concludes that a Government is recognised as sovereign,
although if the Crown declined to answer the inquiry at all,
secondary evidence in default of the best might be accepted.
However, a statement by the Executive that a particular
Government is not recognised does not preclude a British Court
from holding that such Government is a sovereign Govern-
ment, especially in relation to questions not involving jurisdic-
tional immunity.
The deference of American and British Courts to the attitude
of the Executive in this connection has not escaped criticism.
It has been objected that this solicitude for the views of the
Executive is so exaggerated as almost to amount to an obsession.
Moreover, it is asserted that often the Courts have been more
concerned not to embarrass the Executive in its conduct of
foreign affairs than to protect material interests of private
citizens affected by changes in statehood or Government. On
the other hand it is difficult to _see_ how, on a contested issue
of this nature, a Court could take evidence or obtain the
necessary materials for forming its judgment in any more
satisfactory way. However, the Executive now sometimes
elects to give restrictively phrased certificates, in such form that
the Court may reach a decision uninfluenced by possible reac-
tions on the Executive's conduct of foreign policy.
Generally speaking, a British Court will take judicial notice
of:---

(a) the sovereign status of a State or of its monarch;4

(b) the recognition _de facto_ and _de jure_ of a foreign State or
Government, and if in doubt will apply for information to the
appropriate Secretary of State, whose answer is conclusive.

The statement submitted by the Executive to the Court
and inspected by it should not be subjected to any strained or
unreasonable construction, the purpose being to avoid creating
a divergence between the Court and the Executive. Thus in
The Annette,1 the statement was to the effect that the Pro-
visional Government of Northern Russia " had not yet been
formally recognised ", and Hill, J., refused to infer from this
that the said Government had been informally recognised. It
is established by the authorities that a clear, complete and
unambiguous answer by the Secretary of State dispenses with
further inquiry by the Court, and excludes other evidence, if
offered.3 Nor can the Executive be cross-examined as to the
terms of its statement or certificate4, although if these are not
sufficiently plain the Court is entitled in ultimate resort to
make its own independent examination".
A formal statement by the appropriate Secretary of State
tendered to the Court is far from being the sole method of
conveying the Executive's views. The Law Officers may appear,
either by invitation of the Court or on an intervener,6 to inform
the Court of the attitude of the Crown. Also, letters sent
by the Foreign Office to the solicitors acting for one party to
the proceedings, and submitted to the Court, will be regarded
as sufficient evidence of the Crown's views.?

Part 2.---States as Subjects of International Law
Retroactive Effect of Recognition
As we have seen, the recognition of a new State or Govern-
ment has a retroactive operation, and relates back to the date
of inception of the particular State or Government concerned.
In British Courts, such retroactive operation is extremely
wide. Thus:---

(a) A cause of action based upon the existence
of a particular State or Government at the date of institution of
proceedings, is nullified if before or at the time of the hearing,
the British Government recognises another State or Govern-
ment as having been in existence at the date the action was
commenced.1 (b) A judgment of a Court of first instance
based upon the existence of a particular State or Government
at the date of judgment may be set aside on appeal if before or
at the time the appeal is heard, the British Government recog-
nises another State or Government as having been in existence
at the time judgment was delivered.2
Two important decisions of the House of Lords, namely
Gdynia Ameryka Linie (Zeglugowe Spolka Akcyjna) v. Bogus-
lawskiand Civil Air Transport Incorporated v. Central Air
Transport Corporation have further elucidated the retroactive
effect, according to British Courts, of a recognition by Great
Britain.
The former case shows that, in the matter of the retroactive
operation of recognition, the certificate of the executive is to
be treated as of overriding importance; hence, if such certificate
plainly shows that recognition was not intended to relate back,
any retroactive effect is excluded. In other words, whether
and to what extent the act of recognition is retroactive must be
governed by the intention of the recognising State, and this is
logically consistent with the nature of recognition.
The latter case shows that duly vested proprietorial or other

rights, resting upon a duly effected disposition or other legal
act by the formerly recognised _de jure_ Government cannot be
invalidated by the subsequent recognition _de jure_ of the new
Government; _prima facie_, recognition operates retroactively
not to invalidate the acts of a former Government, but to
validate the acts of a _de facto_ Government which has become
the new _de jure_ Government.
Both cases contain _dicta_ in the judgments to the effect that,
_prima facie_, recognition _de jure_ cannot operate retroactively to
validate acts done otherwise than in the territory, and so within
the sphere of _de facto_ control of the Government recognised;
but this, it is emphasised, is only a _prima facie_ rule.
4.-RECOGNITION OF INSURGENCY AND BELLIGERENCY
The topic of recognition of insurgency and belligerency,
which had for many years been more or less a dead one, was
revived in interest in the course of the Spanish Civil War,
1936--1938.
The problems which a civil war in a particular country may
involve for outside Powers may be summed up as follows:
These outside Powers will generally, except when they feel
vital interests are at stake, maintain a policy of non-interference
in the domestic affairs of another State. However, there may
come a time when it becomes impossible as a matter of practical
politics to continue such an attitude either because :---


(a) The operations of insurgent forces may attain such a
degree that they are in effective occupation of and constitute
the _de facto_ authority in a large part of the territory formerly
governed by the parent Government. In this case the problem
is at once raised for outside Powers of entering into some contact
or intercourse with the insurgents as the _de facto_ authorities
1 _See_ Civil Air Transport Incorporated v. Central Air Transport Corporation,
_loc. cit._, at p. 94.
2 There may, prior to this, be simply recognition of the rebel forces as
insurgents, the purpose of which is to prevent the rebels being treated as mere
criminals or pirates, and to preclude any suggestion that the legitimate Govern-
ment is to be held responsible for their acts. As to this distinction, _see_
The Ambrose Light (1885), 25 Fed. 408, and below, pp. 287--288.
S.I.L.-7

166 Part 2.-States as Subjects of International Law
in order to protect their nationals, their commercial interests
and their sea-borne trade in regard to the territory occupied.

(b) The actual war between the parent Government and
the insurgent forces may reach such dimensions that outside
Powers will be compelled to treat the civil war as a real war
between rival Powers, and not as a purely internecine struggle.
In other words, these Powers will have to recognise belligerency.
This is because difficult problems may arise which, unless out-
side Powers accept the risk of being drawn into the war, cannot
be solved without treating the rival parties as belligerents.
This usually occurs where the naval operations of the con-
tending forces interfere with the sea-borne trade of a maritime
Power. For instance, a maritime Power might find it difficult to
resist an impro_per se_arch of its ships for contraband by either
party unless it were prepared to use force; on the other hand,
the concession of belligerent rights would normalise the
situation, by sanctioning the right of search, without com-
promising the maritime Power's authority and rights at
international law.
On account of (a), external Powers may decide on the
_de facto_ recognition of the insurgents, limited to the particular
territory of which they are in effective occupation. Thus in
1937, Great Britain conceded _de facto_ recognition to the in-
surgents in the Spanish Civil War, in regard to the territory
under their control, and also went so far as to exchange Agents.
As to (b) certain conditions must exist before belligerency is
recognised. First, the hostilities must be of a general character,
as distinct from those of a purely local nature. Second, the
insurgents must be in control of a sufficient portion of territory
to justify the inference that they represent a rival Power of some
magnitude. Third, both parties must act in accordance with
the laws of war, and the insurgents in particular must have
organised armed forces under a proper command. Even when
all these conditions are present, the circumstances may pre-
clude recognition of belligerency, as during the Spanish Civil
War of 1936--1938 when the policy of "Non-Intervention " of
the European Powers and their desire to avoid complications

leading to a general war, induced them to stop short of granting
belligerent rights. It would appear, in other words, that the
recognition of belligerency is facultative, and not a matter of
duty.
The British practice in the matter of belligerent recognition
was authoritatively stated by the Law Officers in 1867.1
According to the terms of this statement, the mere declaration
by insurgents that they have constituted a "Provisional
Government" is insufficient to justify belligerent recognition.
Before the grant is made, consideration should be given to
the length of time that the insurrection has continued; the
number, order, and discipline of the insurgent forces; and
whether the newly constituted "Government" is capable of
maintaining international relations with foreign States.
The grant of recognition of belligerency entails the usual
consequences, to the recognising State, of a declaration of
neutrality in the case of a regular war. The recognising
State becomes entitled to neutral rights, and these must be
respected by rival parties. At the same time, the status of
belligerency confers certain rights under the laws of war on
the parent Government and on the insurgents, which are of
advantage as long as the struggle retains its pitch and intensity.
In particular, the legitimate Government is exonerated from
responsibility for acts committed by the insurgents in territory
occupied by them.
Belligerent recognition is quite distinct from the recognition
of either the parent or insurgent Governments as the legitimate
Government. As stated by the British Foreign Secretary,
in 19372:---

Recognition of belligerency is, of course, quite distinct
from recognising any one to whom you give that right as being
the legitimate Government of the Country. It has nothing to
do with it. It is a conception simply concerned with granting
rights of belligerency which are of convenience to the donor as
much as they are to the recipients".
