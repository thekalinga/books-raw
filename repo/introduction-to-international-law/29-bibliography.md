list of recently published French, German and Italian treatises is given
at p. 117 of Clive Parry, The Sources and Evidence of International Law
(1965), a book which should be consulted generally on the bibliography of
international law; and _see also_ for details of standard treatises, dictionaries,
bibliographies, and other materials, J. Robinson, International Law and
Organisation. General Sources of Information (1967).

## State Practice and the Practice of International Institutions

The most authoritative compilation as to British practice (although
a number of volumes remain to be published) is the British Digest of
International Law, edited by Clive Parry, with Judge Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice
as Consulting Editor. _See also_ British and Foreign State Papers, covering
the period from 1812 onwards.

With regard to United States practice, there are three important
compilations :---

* Moore, Digest of International Law (1906), 8 volumes.
* Hackworth, Digest of International Law (1940--1944), 8 volumes.
* Marjorie M. Whiteman, Digest of International Law, the successor
* Digest to Moore and Hackworth (publication continuing).

_See also_ Foreign Relations of the United States, Diplomatic Papers (formerly
published under the earlier titles of Papers Relating to Foreign Affairs, and
Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States) covering
the period since 1861.

Two important collections of basic documents on United States foreign
relations, embracing the period 1941--1955, are A Decade of American
Foreign Policy: Basic Documents, 1941--1949, and American Foreign
Policy, 1950--1955: Basic Documents (published by the Department of
State). Volumes in this series for the year 1956 and following years
have been issued under the title American Foreign Policy: Current
Documents.

On French practice, there is the important compilation, Kiss, Répertoire
de la Pratique Française en Matière de Droit International Public (1962).

Schiffer, Répertoire des Questions de Droit International Général posées
devant la Société des Nations (1942), is a compilation devoted to the
practice of the League of Nations. As to the practice of the United
Nations, _see_ Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs, in 5 volumes,
with Supplements, and Répertoire of Practice of the Security Council,
1946--1951 (1954), with Supplements.

## Treaties and Conventions

For the texts of modern or recent treaties and Conventions, reference
should be made to the following official compilations :---

(i) The British
Treaty Series (from 1892 onwards).
(ii) The League of Nations Treaty
Series.
(iii) The United Nations Treaty Series (published in pursuance
of article 102 of the Charter).[^629/1]

Hudson, International Legislation, published by the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace in 9 volumes, 1931--1950, and covering the
period as from 1919, is an unofficial compilation of the more important
multilateral treaties and Conventions concluded in this time. The texts
of the older instruments are printed in such collections as those of Martens,
Dumont, Hertslet, Malloy, and other compilers of treaties listed in
Oppenheim, _supra_, Vol. I, at pp. 108--111, and are now being reprinted in
The Consolidated Treaty Series, 1648--1918 (annotated), edited by Clive
Parry. _See also_ Professor Parry's Index of British Treaties, 1101--1958.
For the texts of International Labour Conventions, _see_ The International
Labour Code, 1951 (1952), 2 volumes, published by the International
Labour Office, and Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the
I.L. Conference, 1919--1966 (1966).

For a useful guide to compilations of treaties, for purposes of research,
_see_ Ervin H. Pollack, Fundamentals of Legal Research (1967), pp. 421--450.

## Judicial and Arbitral Decisions

The decisions and opinions of the Permanent Court of International
Justice and of the International Court of Justice are published in the
official reports of these two Courts.

Hudson, World Court Reports, 4 volumes, 1934--1943, published also
by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is an unofficial
collection in convenient form of the decisions and opinions of the Permanent
Court.

_See also_ generally as to the case-law of both Courts, E. Hambro,
The Case Law of the International Court, Vols. I-V, and J. H. W. Verzijl,
The Jurisprudence of the World Court, Vol. I (1922--1940), published
1965, and Vol. II (1947--1965), published 1966.

For the municipal judicial decisions of all countries on points of international
law, from 1919 onwards, _see_ the Annual Digest of Public International
Law Cases, the title of which was changed in the 1933--1934
volume to the Annual Digest and Reports of Public International Law Cases,
and which as from 1950 has been published annually under the title,
International Law Reports. Decisions of British Courts are to be found
in the collection, British International Law Cases (first volume published
1964).

The principal awards and adjudications of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration are reprinted in Scott, Hague Court Reports (1916), a second
series of which was published in 1932. Other collections of arbitral
decisions are the United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards,
Moore, History and Digest of International Arbitrations to which the
United States has been a party (1898), 6 volumes, the same author's
International Adjudications Ancient and Modern (1929--1936), and De la
Pradelle and Politis, Recueil des Arbitrages Internationaux.

Schwarzenberger, International Law, Vol. I, International Law as
Applied by International Courts and Tribunals (3rd edition, 1957), and
Vol. II, Law of Armed Conflict (1968), is a valuable account of international
law based on international judicial and arbitral decisions,
illustrating the author's inductive approach to the subject.

## General

Throughout this book, there are references in the footnotes to certain
articles, treatises, and text-books, most of which are readily accessible,
and may be consulted for wider reading on each of the different branches
of the subject.

The leading periodicals in English on international law are the American
Journal of International Law (quarterly), the International and Comparative
Law Quarterly, and the Year Book of World Affairs (London Institute of
World Affairs; this Year Book deals with both international affairs and
international law). These contain, in addition to articles and notes, the
reproduction of the texts of international documents, accounts of British
and American practice, and annotations and commentaries on significant
judicial or arbitral decisions. Mention may also be made of the Canadian
Yearbook of International Law (Annuaire canadien de Droit international)
and of the Australian Year Book of International Law, which are newcomers
from the Commonwealth to the field of the periodical literature of
international law. An important annual publication in India is the
Indian Year Book of International Affairs, the 1964 issue of which contained
a number of historical studies.

Leading and important foreign periodical publications include the
Annuaire Français de Droit International and Revue Générale de Droit
International (French), the Netherlands International Law Review, the
Soviet Year-Book of International Law (Soviet Association of International
Law), and the Japanese Annual of International Law.

Current, continuing compilations of legal documentary materials
include International Legal Materials, published bi-monthly (American
Society of International Law), and the United Nations Juridical Yearbook
(United Nations).

For useful general bibliographies, _see_ Briggs, p. 628, _ante_, Schwarzenberger,
p. 630, _ante_, Stone, p. 628, _ante_, Sohn, Cases and Other Materials
on World Law (1950), O'Connell, and Verdross, p. 628, _ante_, the last-mentioned
being particularly valuable for references to the Continental
literature.

A select bibliography on the law and practice of treaties is contained
in the United Nations publication, Laws and Practices concerning the
Conclusion of Treaties (1953), at pp. 141--189.

In the Yearbooks of the International Court of Justice (the latest is the
Yearbook, 1969--1970), there is much useful information concerning the
Court, its adjudications, and its functions generally. Prior to the Yearbook,
1964--1965, these annual volumes contained an extensive
bibliography of books, articles, and studies published concerning the
Court, but the bibliographies are now being published separately in
annual issues.

[^628/1]: An excellent introductory work in French is Professor Dupuy's Le Droit
International (2nd edition, Paris, 1966) in the "Que sais-je ?" series.

[^629/1]: Treaties and international agreements entered into by the United States,
1895--1949, are published in the Statutes at Large; from 1950 onwards in the
compilation, United States Treaties and Other International Agreements.
