# Preface

For more than thirty years the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)
has been struggling for the legitimate rights of the Kurdish
people. Our struggle, our fight for liberation turned the Kurdish
question into an international issue which affected the entire
Middle East and brought a solution of the Kurdish question
within reach.

When the PKK was formed in the 1970s the international
ideological and political climate was characterized by the bipolar
world of the Cold War and the conflict between the socialist and
the capitalist camps. The PKK was inspired at that time by the
rise of decolonialization movements all over the world. In this
context we tried to find our own way in agreement with the particular
situation in our homeland. The PKK never regarded the
Kurdish question as a mere problem of ethnicity or nationhood.
Rather, we believed, it was the project of liberating the society
and democratizing it. These aims increasingly determined our actions
since the 1990s.

We also recognized a causal link between the Kurdish question
and the global domination of the modern capitalist system.
Without questioning and challenging this link a solution would
not be possible. Otherwise we would only become involved in
new dependencies.

So far, with a view to issues of ethnicity and nationhood like
the Kurdish question, which have their roots deep in history and
at the foundations of society, there seemed to be only one viable
solution: the creation of a nation-state, which was the paradigm
of the capitalist modernity at that time.

We did not believe, however, that any ready-made political
blueprints would be able to sustainably improve the situation of
the people in the Middle East. Had it not been nationalism and
nation-states which had created so many problems in the Middle
East?

Let us therefore take a closer look at the historical background
of this paradigm and see whether we can map a solution that
avoids the trap of nationalism and fits the situation of the Middle
East better.
