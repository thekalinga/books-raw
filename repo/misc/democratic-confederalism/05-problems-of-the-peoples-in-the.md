# Problems of the Peoples in the Middle East and Possible Ways to a Solution

The national question is not a phantasm of the capitalist modernity.
Nevertheless it was the capitalist modernity which imposed
the national question on the society. The nation replaced the religious
community. However, the transition to a national society
needs the overcoming of the capitalist modernity if the nation is
not to remain the disguise of repressive monopolies.

As negative as is the over-emphasis of the national category in
the Middle East as severe would be the consequences of neglecting
the collective national aspect. Hence the method in handling
the issue should not be ideological but scientific and not nationstatist
but based on the concept of democratic nation and democratic
communalism. The contents of such an approach are the
fundamental elements of democratic modernity.

Over the past two centuries nationalism and tendency for nation-states
have been fuelled in the societies of the Middle East.
The national issues have not been solved but rather have been aggravated
in all areas of the society. Instead of cultivating productive
competition the capital enforces internal and external wars in
the name of the nation-state.

The theory of communalism would be an alternative to capitalism.
In the framework of democratic nations which do not strive
for power monopolies it may lead to peace in a region which has
only been the field of gory wars and genocides.

In this context we can speak of four majority nations: Arabs,
Persians, Turks, and Kurds. I do not wish to divide nations into
majority or minority as I do not find this to be appropriate. But
due to demographic considerations I shall speak of majority nations.
In the same context we may also use the term minority
nations.

1. There are more than twenty Arab nation-states which divide
   the Arab community and damage their societies by wars. This
   is one of the main factors responsible for the alienation of cultural values and the apparent hopelessness of the Arab national
   question. These nation-states have not even been able to form a
   cross-national economic community. They are the main reason of
   the problematic situation of the Arab nation. A religiously motivated tribal nationalism together with a sexist patriarchal society
   pervades all areas of the society resulting in distinct conservatism
   and slavish obedience. Nobody believes that the Arabs will be
   able to find an Arab national solution to their internal and crossnational problems. However, democratization and a communalist approach might provide such a solution. Their weakness towards Israel, which the Arab nation-states regard as a competitor,
   is not only the result of international support by the hegemonic
   powers. Rather, it is the result of a strong internal democratic
   and communal institutions within Israel. Over the last century,
   the society of the Arab nation has been weakened by radical nationalism and Islamism. Yet, if they are able to unite communal
   socialism which they are not a stranger to with that of the understanding of a democratic nation then they may be able to find
   themselves a secure, long-term solution.
2. The Turks and Turkmens form another influential nation.
   They share a similar understandings of power and ideology with
   the Arabs. They are strict nation-statists and have a profound religious and racial nationalism engraved in them. From a sociological point of view, the Turks and Turkmens are quite different.
   The relations between Turkmen and Turkish aristocracy resemble
   the tensed relations between Bedouins and Arab aristocracy. They
   form a stratum whose interests are compatible with democracy
   and communalism. The national problems are quite complex.
   The power strive of the nation-state, distinct nationalism and a
   sexist patriarchal society prevail and create a very conservative society. The family is regarded as the smallest cell of the state. Both
   individuals and institutions have taken in these aspects. Turkish and Turkmen communities struggle for power. Other ethnic
   groups are subjected to a distinct policy of subjugation. The centralist power structures of the Turkish nation-state and the rigid
   official ideology have prevented a solution to the Kurdish question until today. The society is made to believe that there is no alternative to the state. There is no balance between the individual
   and the state. Obedience is regarded as the greatest virtue.
   In contrast to this, the theory of the democratic modernity offers an adequate approach to all national communities in Turkey
   to solve their national problems. Community based project of
   a democratic Turkish confederation would both strengthen its
   internal unity and and create the conditions for a peaceful coexistence with the neighbours that it lives with. Borders have
   lost its former meaning when it comes to social unity. In spite
   of geographic boundaries today's modern communication tools
   allow for a virtual unity between individuals and communities
   wherever they are. A democratic confederation of the Turkish national communities could be a contribution to world peace and
   the system of democratic modernity.
3. The Kurdish national society is very complex. Worldwide, the
   Kurds are the biggest nation without a state of their own. They
   have been settling in their present settlement areas since the Neolithic. Agriculture and stock breeding as well as their readiness
   to defend themselves using the geographic advantages of their
   mountainous homeland helped the Kurds to survive as a native
   people. The Kurdish national question rises from the fact that
   they have been denied their right to nationhood. Others tried
   to assimilate them, annihilate them, and in the end flatly denied
   their existence. Not having a state of their own has advantages
   and disadvantages. The excrescences of state-based civilizations
   have only been taken in to a limited extent. This can be a benefit
   in the realization of alternative social concepts beyond the capitalist modernity. Their settlement area is divided by the national
   borders of four countries and lies in a geo-strategically important region, thus providing the Kurds a strategic advantage. The
   Kurds do not have the chance to form a national society through
   the use of state-power. Although there is a Kurdish political entity today in Iraqi-Kurdistan, it is not a nation-state but rather a
   parastatal entity.
   Kurdistan had also been home to Armenian and Aramaic
   minorities before these fell victims to genocides. There are also
   smaller groups of Arabs and Turks. Even today there are many
   different religions and faiths living side by side there. There also
   rudiments of a clan and tribal culture while there is almost no
   presence of urban culture there.
   All these properties are a blessing for new democratic political
   formations. Communal cooperatives in farming but also in the
   water economy and the energy sector offer themselves as ideal
   ways of production. The situation is also favourable for the development of an ethical political society. Even the patriarchal ideology is less deeply rooted here than in the neighbouring societies.
   This is beneficial for the establishment of a democratic society
   where women's freedom and equality are to form one of the main
   pillars. It also offers the conditions for the creation of a democratic environment-friendly nation in line with the paradigm of
   the democratic modernity. The construction of a democratic nation based on multi-national identities is the ideal solution when
   faced with the dead-end street nation-state. The emerging entity
   could become a blueprint for the entire Middle East and expand
   dynamically into neighbouring countries. Convincing the neighbouring nations of this model shall change the fate of the Middle
   East and shall reinforce the chance of democratic modernity to
   create an alternative. In this sense, therefore, the freedom of the
   Kurds and the democratization of their society would be synonymous with the freedom of the whole region and its societies.
4. The reasons for today's problems of the Persian or Iranian nation can be found in the interventions of historical civilizations
   and the capitalist modernity. Although their original identity was
   a result of Zoroastrian and Mithraic tradition these have been
   annulled by a derivative of Islam. Manichaeism that emerged
   as the synthesis of Judaism, Christianity and Mohammedanism
   with Greek philosophy was not able to prevail against the ideology of the official civilization. Indeed, it went no further then
   to nurture the tradition of rebellion. It has hence converted the
   Islamic tradition into Shi'ah denomination and adopted it to be
   its latest civilizational ideology. Presently there are efforts made to
   modernize itself by passing the elements of capitalist modernity
   through its Shi'ah filter.
   The Iranian society is multi-ethnic and multi-religious and
   blessed with a rich culture. All national and religious identities
   of the Middle East can be found there. This diversity is in strong
   contrast to the hegemonic claim of the theocracy, which cultivates a subtle religious nationalism and the ruling class does not
   shrink back from anti-modernist propaganda whenever it serves
   their interests. Revolutionary and democratic tendencies have
   been integrated by the traditional civilization. A despotic regime
   skilfully governs the country. The negative effects of American
   and European sanctions are not negligible here.
   Despite strong centralist efforts in Iran, from the grass-roots
   already some kind of federalism exists. When elements of democratic civilisation and federalist elements including Azeris,
   Kurds, Baluchis, Arabs, and Turkmens intersect, the project of a
   "Democratic Confederation of Iran" can emerge and become attractive. Women's movement and communal traditions will play
   a special role here.
5. The Armenian national question contains one of the greatest
   tragedies that the progress of the capitalist modernity has brought
   about in the Middle East. The Armenians are a very old people.
   They shared much of their settlement area with the Kurds. While
   the Kurds live primarily on agriculture and animal husbandry the
   Armenians engaged in arts and crafts. Just like the Kurds, the Armenians cultivated a tradition of self-defence. Apart from some
   short episodes the Armenians never successfully founded a state.
   They rely on Christian culture which gives them their identity
   and their faith in salvation. Because of their religion they often
   suffered repression at the hands of the Muslim majority. Hence,
   the emerging nationalism bore fruit with the Armenian bourgeoisie. Soon there were differences with the Turkish nationalists
   eventually ending in the genocide of the Armenians by the Turks.
   Apart from the Jews the Armenians are the second-largest
   people which live primarily in the Diaspora. The foundation of
   an Armenian state in the west of Azerbaijan, however, did not
   solve the Armenian national question. The consequences of the
   genocide can hardly be put into words. The search for the lost
   country defines their national psyche and is at the heart of the
   Armenian question. The issue is aggravated by the fact that these
   areas have been settled by other people since then. Any concepts
   based on a nation-state cannot offer a solution. There is neither
   a homogenous population structure there nor any clear borders
   as is required by the capitalist modernity. The thinking of their
   opponents may be fascist; however, it is not enough to only bring
   the genocide to one's mind. Confederate structures could be an
   alternative for the Armenians. The foundation of a democratic
   Armenian nation in line with the paradigm of the democratic
   modernity promises the Armenians an opportunity to reinvent
   themselves. It could enable them to return to their place in the
   cultural plurality of the Middle East. In the event that they renew
   themselves under the Armenian democratic nation not only shall
   they continue to play their historical role within the Middle East
   culture but they shall also find the right path to liberation.
6. In modern times the Christian Arameans (Assyrians) also suffered the fate of the Armenians. They too are one of the oldest
   people in the Middle East. They shared a settlement area with
   the Kurds but also with other people. Like the Armenians they
   suffered from repression by the Muslim majority paving the way
   for European-style nationalism among the Aramean bourgeoisie. Eventually the Arameans too fell victims to genocide at the
   hands of the Turks under the leadership of the fascist Committee
   of Unity and Progress. The collaborationist Kurds lent a helping
   hand in this genocide. The question of Aramean national society
   has its roots in the civilization but has also developed further with
   Christianity and ideologies of modernity. For a solution there is a
   need for a radical transformation of the Arameans. Their real salvation may be to break away from the mentality of classical civilization and capitalist modernity and instead embrace democratic
   civilization and renew their rich cultural memory as an element
   of democratic modernity in order to re-construct themselves as
   the "Aramean Democratic Nation".
7. The history of the Jewish people also gives expression to the
   overall problematic cultural history of the Middle East. The
   search for the backdrop of expulsion, pogroms and genocide
   amounts to balancing the accounts of the civilizations. The Jewish community has taken up the influences of the old Sumerian
   and Egyptian cultures as well as those of regional tribal cultures.
   It has contributed a lot to the culture of the Middle East. Like
   the Arameans they fell victims to extreme developments of modernity. Against this background, intellectuals of Jewish descent
   developed a complex point of view towards these issues. However, this is by far not enough. For a solution of the problems
   as they exist today a renewed appropriation of the history of the
   Middle East is needed on a democratic basis. The Israeli nationstate is at war since its foundation. The slogan is: an eye for an
   eye. Fire cannot be fought by fire, though. Even if Israel enjoys
   relative security thanks to its international support, this is not a
   sustainable solution. Nothing will be permanently safe as long as
   the capitalist modernity has not been overcome.
   The Palestine conflict makes it clear that the nation-state paradigm is not helpful for a solution. There has been much bloodshed; what remains is the difficult legacy of seemingly irresolvable
   problems. The Israel-Palestine example shows the complete failure of the capitalist modernity and the nation-state.
   The Jews belong to the culture bearers of the Middle East.
   Denial of their right to existence is an attack on the Middle East
   as such. Their transformation into a democratic nation just as
   for Armenians and Arameans would make their participation in
   a democratic confederation of the Middle East easier. The project of an "East-Aegean Democratic Confederation" would be a
   positive start. Strict and exclusive national and religious identities may evolve into flexible and open identities under this project. Israel may also evolve into a more acceptable open democratic nation. Undoubtedly though its neighbours must also go
   through such a transformation.
   Tensions and armed conflicts in the Middle East make a
   transformation of the paradigm of modernity seem inevitable.
   Without it a solution of the difficult social problems and national
   questions is impossible. Democratic modernity offers an alternative to the system that is unable to resolve problems.
8. The annihilation of Hellenic culture in Anatolia is a loss that
   cannot be compensated. The ethnic cleansing arranged by the
   Turkish and Greek nation-states in the first quarter of the last
   century has left its mark. No state has the right to drive people
   from their ancestral cultural region. Nevertheless, the nationstates showed their inhuman approach towards such issues again
   and again. The attacks on the Hellenic, Jewish, Aramean and
   Armenian cultures were stepped up while Islam spread throughout the Middle East. This, in turn, contributed to the decline of
   the Middle-Eastern Civilization. The Islamic culture has never
   been able to fill the emerging void. In the 19th century when the
   capitalist modernity advanced into the Middle East it found a
   cultural desert created by self-inflicted cultural erosion. Cultural
   diversity also strengthens the defence mechanism of a society.
   Monocultures are less robust. Hence, the conquest of the Middle East had not been difficult. The project of a homogeneous
   nation as propagated by the nation-states furthered their cultural
   decline.
9. The Caucasian ethnic groups also have social problems which
   are not insignificant. Again and again they have migrated into
   the Middle East and stimulated its cultures. They have unquestionably contributed to its cultural wealth. The arrival of modernity almost made these minority cultures disappear. They, too,
   would find their adequate place in a confederate structure.
   Finally, let me state again that the fundamental problems of the
   Middle East are deeply rooted in the class civilization. They have
   tightened with the global crisis of the capitalist modernity. This
   modernity and its claim to dominance cannot offer any solutions
   not to mention a long-term perspective for the Middle-East region. The future is democratic confederalism.
