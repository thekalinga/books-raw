# Democratic Confederalism

This kind of rule or administration can be called a non-state
political administration or a democracy without a state. Democratic
decision-making processes must not be confused with the
processes known from public administration. States only administrate
while democracies govern. States are founded on power;
democracies are based on collective consensus. Office in the state
is determined by decree, even though it may be in part legitimized
by elections. Democracies use direct elections. The state
uses coercion as a legitimate means. Democracies rest on voluntary
participation.

Democratic confederalism is open towards other political
groups and factions. It is flexible, multi-cultural, anti-monopolistic,
and consensus-oriented. Ecology and feminism are central
pillars. In the frame of this kind of self-administration an alternative
economy will become necessary, which increases the resources
of the society instead of exploiting them and thus does justice
to the manifold needs of the society.

## Participation and the Diversity of the Political Landscape

The contradictory composition of the society necessitates political
groups with both vertical and horizontal formations. Central,
regional and local groups need to be balanced in this way. Only
they, each for itself, are able to deal with its special concrete situation
and develop appropriate solutions for far-reaching social
problems. It is a natural right to express one's cultural, ethnic, or
national identity with the help of political associations. However,
this right needs an ethical and political society. Whether nationstate,
republic, or democracy -- democratic confederalism is open
for compromises concerning state or governmental traditions. It
allows for equal coexistence.

## The Heritage of the Society and the Accumulation of Historical Knowledge

Then again, democratic confederalism rests on the historical experience
of the society and its collective heritage. It is not an arbitrary
modern political system but, rather, accumulates history
and experience. It is the offspring of the life of the society.

The state continuously orientates itself towards centralism
in order to pursue the interests of the power monopolies. Just
the opposite is true for confederalism. Not the monopolies but
the society is at the centre of political focus. The heterogeneous
structure of the society is in contradiction to all forms of centralism.
Distinct centralism only results in social eruptions.

Within living memory people have always formed loose groups
of clans, tribes or other communities with federal qualities. In
this way they were able to preserve their internal autonomy. Even
the internal government of empires employed diverse methods of
self-administration for their different parts, which included religious
authorities, tribal councils, kingdoms, and even republics.
Hence it is important to understand, that even centralist seeming
empires follow a confederate organizational structure. The
centralist model is not an administrative model wanted by the
society. Instead, it has its source in the preservation of power of
the monopolies.

## Ethics and Political Awareness

The classification of the society in categories and terms after a
certain pattern is produced artificially by the capitalist monopolies.
What counts in a society like that is not what you are but
what you appear to be. The putative alienation of the society
from its own existence encourages the withdrawal from active
participation, a reaction which is often called disenchantment
with politics. However, societies are essentially political and value-oriented.
Economic, political, ideological, and military monopolies
are constructions which contradict the nature of society
by merely striving for the accumulation of surplus. They do not
create values. Nor can a revolution create a new society. It can
only influence the ethical and political web of a society. Anything
else is at the discretion of the ethics-based political society.

I mentioned already that the capitalist modernity enforces the
centralization of the state. The political and military power centres
within the society have been deprived of their influence. The
nation-state as a modern substitute of monarchy left a weakened
and defenceless society behind. In this respect, legal order and
public peace only imply the class rule of the bourgeoisie. Power
constitutes itself in the central state and becomes one of the fundamental
administrative paradigms of modernity. This puts the
nation-state in contrast to democracy and republicanism.

Our project of "democratic modernity" is meant as an alternative
draft to modernity as we know it. It builds on democratic
confederalism as a fundamental political paradigm. Democratic
modernity is the roof of an ethics-based political society. As long
as we make the mistake to believe that societies need to be homogeneous
monolithic entities it will be difficult to understand
confederalism. Modernity's history is also a history of four centuries
of cultural and physical genocide in the name of an imaginary
unitary society. Democratic confederalism as a sociological
category is the counterpart of this history and it rests on the will
to fight if necessary as well as on ethnic, cultural, and political
diversity.

The crisis of the financial system is an inherent consequence
of the capitalist nation-state. However, all efforts of the neoliberals
to change the nation-state have remained unsuccessful. The
Middle East provides instructive examples.

## Democratic Confederalism and a Democratic Political System

In contrast to a centralist and bureaucratic understanding of administration
and exercise of power confederalism poses a type of
political self-administration where all groups of the society and
all cultural identities can express themselves in local meetings,
general conventions and councils. This understanding of democracy
opens the political space to all strata of the society and allows
for the formation of different and diverse political groups. In this
way it also advances the political integration of the society as a
whole. Politics becomes a part of everyday life. Without politics
the crisis of the state cannot be solved since the crisis is fuelled
by a lack of representation of the political society. Terms like
federalism or self administration as they can be found in liberal
democracies need to be conceived anew. Essentially, they should
not be conceived as hierarchical levels of the administration of
the nation-state but rather as central tools of social expression
and participation. This, in turn, will advance the politicization
of the society. We do not need big theories here, what we need
is the will to lend expression to the social needs by strengthening
the autonomy of the social actors structurally and by creating
the conditions for the organization of the society as a whole.
The creation of an operational level where all kinds of social and
political groups, religious communities, or intellectual tendencies
can express themselves directly in all local decision-making processes
can also be called participative democracy. The stronger the
participation the more powerful is this kind of democracy. While
the nation-state is in contrast to democracy, and even denies it,
democratic confederalism constitutes a continuous democratic
process.

The social actors, which are each for itself federative units, are
the germ cells of participative democracy. They can combine
and associate into new groups and confederations according to
the situation. Each of the political units involved in participative
democracy is essentially democratic. In this way, what we
call democracy then is the application of democratic processes
of decision-making from the local level to the global level in the
framework of a continuous political process. This process will affect
the structure of the social web of the society in contrast to
the striving for homogeneity of the nation-state, a construct that
can only be realized by force thus bringing about the loss of freedom.

I have already addressed the point that the local level is the level
where the decisions are made. However, the thinking leading
to these decisions needs to be in line with global issues. We need
to become aware of the fact that even villages and urban neighbourhoods
require confederate structures. All areas of the society
need to be given to self-administration, all levels of it need to be
free to participate.

## Democratic Confederalism and Self-Defence

Essentially, the nation-state is a militarily structured entity. Nation-states
are eventually the products of all kinds of internal and
external warfare. None of the existing nation-states has come
into existence all by itself. Invariably, they have a record of wars.
This process is not limited to their founding phase but, rather, it
builds on the militarization of the entire society. The civil leadership
of the state is only an accessory of the military apparatus.
Liberal democracies even outdo this by painting their militaristic
structures in democratic and liberal colours. However, this does
not keep them from seeking authoritarian solutions at the highpoint
of a crisis caused by the system itself. Fascist exercise of
power is the nature of the nation-state. Fascism is the purest form
of the nation-state.

This militarization can only be pushed back with the help of
self-defence. Societies without any mechanism of self-defence
lose their identities, their capability of democratic decision-making,
and their political nature. Therefore, the self-defence of a
society is not limited to the military dimension alone. It also presupposes
the preservation of its identity, its own political awareness,
and a process of democratization. Only then can we talk
about self-defence.

Against this background democratic confederalism can be
called a system of self-defence of the society. Only with the help
of confederate networks can there be a basis to oppose the global
domination of the monopolies and nation-state militarism.
Against the network of monopolies we must build up an equally
strong network of social confederacies.

This means in particular that the social paradigm of
confederalism does not involve a military monopoly for the
armed forces, which do only have the task of ensuring the internal
and external security. They are under direct control of the
democratic institutions. The society itself must be able to determine
their duties. One of their tasks will be the defence of the
free will of the society from internal and external interventions.
The composition of the military leadership needs to be determined
in equal terms and parts by both the political institutions
and the confederate groupings.

## Democratic Confederalism Versus Strife for Hegemony

In democratic confederalism there is no room for any kind of
hegemony striving. This is particularly true in the field of ideology.
Hegemony is a principle that is usually followed by the classic
type of civilization. Democratic civilizations reject hegemonic
powers and ideologies. Any ways of expression which cut across
the boundaries of democratic self-administration would carry
self-administration and freedom of expression ad absurdum. The
collective handling of matters of the society needs understanding,
respect of dissenting opinions and democratic ways of decisionmaking.
This is in contrast to the understanding of leadership
in the capitalist modernity where arbitrary bureaucratic decisions
of nation-state character are diametrically opposed to the
democratic-confederate leadership in line with ethic foundations.
In democratic confederalism leadership institutions do not need
ideological legitimization. Hence, they need not strive for hegemony.

## Democratic Confederate Structures at a Global scale

Although in democratic confederalism the focus is on the local
level, organizing confederalism globally is not excluded. Contrariwise,
we need to put up a platform of national civil societies in
terms of a confederate assembly to oppose the United Nations as
an association of nation-states under the leadership of the superpowers.
In this way we might get better decisions with a view to
peace, ecology, justice and productivity in the world.

## Conclusion

Democratic confederalism can be described as a kind of selfadministration
in contrast to the administration by the nationstate.
However, under certain circumstances peaceful coexistence
is possible as long as the nation-state does not interfere with central
matters of self-administration. All such interventions would
call for the self-defence of the civil society.

Democratic confederalism is not at war with any nation-state
but it will not stand idly by at assimilation efforts. Revolutionary
overthrow or the foundation of a new state does not create sustainable
change. In the long run, freedom and justice can only be
accomplished within a democratic-confederate dynamic process.

Neither total rejection nor complete recognition of the state
is useful for the democratic efforts of the civil society. The overcoming
of the state, particularly the nation-state, is a long-term
process.

The state will be overcome when democratic confederalism has
proved its problem-solving capacities with a view to social issues.
This does not mean, though, that attacks by nation-states have to
be accepted. Democratic confederations will sustain self-defence
forces at all times. Democratic confederations will not be limited
to organize themselves within a single particular territory. They
will become cross-border confederations when the societies concerned
so desire.
