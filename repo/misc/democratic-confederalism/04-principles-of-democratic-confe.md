# Principles of Democratic Confederalism

1. The right of self-determination of the peoples includes the
right to a state of their own. However, the foundation of a
state does not increase the freedom of a people. The system
of the United Nations that is based on nation-states has remained
inefficient. Meanwhile, nation-states have become
serious obstacles for any social development. Democratic
confederalism is the contrasting paradigm of the oppressed
people.
2. Democratic confederalism is a non-state social paradigm. It
is not controlled by a state. At the same time, democratic
confederalism is the cultural organizational blueprint of a
democratic nation.
3. Democratic confederalism is based on grass-roots participation.
Its decision-making processes lie with the communities.
Higher levels only serve the coordination and implementation
of the will of the communities that send their delegates
to the general assemblies. For limited space of time they are
both mouthpiece and executive institutions. However, the
basic power of decision rests with the local grass-roots institutions.
4. In the Middle East, democracy cannot be imposed by the
capitalist system and its imperial powers which only damage
democracy. The propagation of grass-roots democracy is elementary.
It is the only approach that can cope with diverse
ethnical groups, religions, and class differences. It also goes
together well with the traditional confederate structure of the
society.
5. Democratic confederalism in Kurdistan is an anti-nationalist
movement as well. It aims at realizing the right of self-defence
of the peoples by the advancement of democracy in all
parts of Kurdistan without questioning the existing political
borders. Its goal is not the foundation of a Kurdish nationstate.
The movement intends to establish federal structures in
Iran, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq that are open for all Kurds and
at the same time form an umbrella confederation for all four
parts of Kurdistan.
