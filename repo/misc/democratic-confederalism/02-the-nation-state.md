# The Nation-State

## Basics

With the sedentarization of people they began to form an idea
of the area that they were living in, its extension and its boundaries,
which were mostly determined by nature and features of
the landscape. Clans and tribes that had settled in a certain area
and lived there for a long period of time developed the notions
of a common identity and of the homeland. The boundaries between
what the tribes saw as their homelands were not yet borders.
Commerce, culture or language were not restricted by the
boundaries. Territorial borders remained flexible for a long time.
Feudal structures prevailed almost everywhere and now and then
dynastic monarchies or great multi-ethnic empires rose with continuously
changing borders and many different languages and
religious communities like the Roman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, the Ottoman Empire or the British Empire. They
survived long periods of time and many political changes because
their feudal basis enabled them to distribute power flexibly over a
wide range of smaller secondary power centres.

### Nation-state and Power

With the appearance of the nation-state trade, commerce and finance
pushed for political participation and subsequently added
their power to the traditional state structures. The development
of the nation-state at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution
more than two hundred years ago went hand in hand with the
unregulated accumulation of capital on the one hand and the
unhindered exploitation of the fast growing population on the
other hand. The new bourgeoisie which rose from this revolution
wanted to take part in the political decisions and state structures.
Capitalism, their new economic system, thus became an inherent
component of the new nation-state. The nation-state needed the
bourgeoisie and the power of the capital in order to replace the
old feudal order and its ideology which rested on tribal structures
and inherited rights by a new national ideology which united all
tribes and clans under the roof of the nation. In this way, capitalism
and nation-state became so closely linked to each other that
neither could be imagined to exist without the other. As a consequence
of this, exploitation was not only sanctioned by the state
but even encouraged and facilitated.

But above all the nation-state must be thought as the maximum
form of power. None of the other types of state have such
a capacity of power. One of the main reasons for this is that the
upper part of the middle-class has been linked to the process of
monopolization in an ever-more increasing manner. The nationstate
itself is the most developed complete monopoly. It is the
most developed unity of monopolies such as trade, industrial, finance
and power. One should also think of ideological monopoly
as an indivisible part of the power monopoly.

### The State and its Religious Roots
The religious roots of the state have already been discussed in detail
(A. Ocalan, The Roots of Civilisation, London, 2007). Many
contemporary political concepts and notions have their origin in
religious or theological concepts or structures. In fact, a closer
look reveals that religion and divine imagination brought about
the first social identities in history. They formed the ideological
glue of many tribes and other pre-state communities and defined
their existence as communities.

Later, after state structures had already developed, the traditional
links between state, power and society began to weaken.
The sacred and divine ideas and practices which had been present
at the origin of the community increasingly lost their meaning
for the common identity and were, instead, transferred onto
power structures like monarchs or dictators. The state and its
power were derived from divine will and law and its ruler became
king by the grace of God. They represented divine power
on earth.

Today, most modern states call themselves secular, claiming
that the old bonds between religion and state have been severed
and that religion is no longer a part of the state. This is arguably
only half the truth. Even if religious institutions or representatives
of the clergy do no longer participate in political and social
decision-making they still do influence these decisions to an extent
just as they are influenced themselves by political or social
ideas and developments. Therefore, secularism, or laicism as it is
called in Turkey, still contains religious elements. The separation
of state and religion is the result of a political decision. It did not
come naturally. This is why even today power and state seem to
be something given, god-given we might even say. Notions like
secular state or secular power remain ambiguous.

The nation-state has also allocated a number of attributes
which serve to replace older religiously rooted attributes like: nation,
fatherland, national flag, national anthem, and many others.
Particularly notions like the unity of state and nation serve to
transcend the material political structures and are, as such, reminiscent
of the pre-state unity with God. They have been put in the
place of the divine.

When in former times a tribe subjugated another tribe its
members had to worship the gods of the victors. We may arguably
call this process a process of colonization, even assimilation.
The nation-state is a centralized state with quasi-divine attributes
that has completely disarmed the society and monopolizes the
use of force.

### Bureaucracy and the Nation-State

Since the nation-state transcends its material basis, the citizens,
it assumes an existence beyond its political institutions. It needs
additional institutions of its own to protect its ideological basis
as well as legal, economic and religious structures. The resulting
ever-expanding civil and military bureaucracy is expensive and
serves only the preservation of the transcendent state itself, which
in turn elevates the bureaucracy above the people.

During the European modernity the state had all means at
its disposal to expand its bureaucracy into all strata of the society.
There it grew like cancer infecting all lifelines of the society.
Bureaucracy and nation-state cannot exist without each other. If
the nation-state is the backbone of the capitalist modernity it certainly
is the cage of the natural society. Its bureaucracy secures
the smooth functioning of the system, secures the basis of the
production of goods, and secures the profits for the relevant economic
actors in both the real-socialist and the business-friendly
nation-state. The nation-state domesticates the society in the
name of capitalism and alienates the community from its natural
foundations. Any analysis meant to localize and solve social problems
needs to take a close look at these links.

### Nation-State and Homogeneity

The nation-state in its original form aimed at the monopolization
of all social processes. Diversity and plurality had to be fought,
an approach that led into assimilation and genocide. It does not
only exploit the ideas and the labour potential of the society and
colonize the heads of the people in the name of capitalism. It
also assimilates all kinds of spiritual and intellectual ideas and
cultures in order to preserve its own existence. It aims at creating
a single national culture, a single national identity, and a single
unified religious community. Thus it also enforces a homogeneous
citizenship. The notion of citizen has been created as a result
of the quest for such a homogeneity. The citizenship of modernity
defines nothing but the transition made from private slavery
to state slavery. Capitalism can not attain profit in the absence of
such modern slave armies. The homogenic national society is the
most artificial society to have ever been created and is the result
of the "social engineering project".

These goals are generally accomplished by the use of force or
by financial incentives and have often resulted in the physical
annihilation of minorities, cultures, or languages or in forced
assimilation. The history of the last two centuries is full of examples
illustrating the violent attempts at creating a nation that
corresponds to the imaginary reality of a true nation-state.

### Nation-State and Society

It is often said that the nation-state is concerned with the fate of
the common people. This is not true. Rather, it is the national
governor of the worldwide capitalist system, a vassal of the capitalist
modernity which is more deeply entangled in the dominant
structures of the capital than we usually tend to assume: It
is a colony of the capital. Regardless how nationalist the nationstate
may present itself, it serves to the same extent the capitalist
processes of exploitation. There is no other explanation for the
horrible redistribution wars of the capitalist modernity. Thus the
nation-state is not with the common people -- it is an enemy of
the peoples.

Relations between other nation-states and international monopolies
are coordinated by the diplomats of the nation-state.
Without the recognition by other nation-states none of them
could survive. The reason can be found in the logic of the worldwide
capitalist system. Nation-states which leave the phalanx of
the capitalist system will be overtaken by the same fate that the
Saddam regime in Iraq experienced or it will be brought to its
knees by means of economic embargoes.

Let us now derive some characteristics of the nation-state from
the example of the Republic of Turkey.

## Ideological Foundations of the Nation-State

In the past the history of states was often equated with the history
of their rulers, which lent them almost divine qualities. This
practice changed with the rise of the nation-state. Now the entire
state was idealized and elevated to a divine level.

### Nationalism

Assuming that we would compare the nation-state to a living god
then nationalism would be the correspondent religion. In spite of
some seemingly positive elements, nation-state and nationalism
show metaphysical characteristics. In this context, capitalist profit
and the accumulation of capital appear as categories shrouded
in mystery. There is a network of contradictory relations behind
these terms that is based on force and exploitation. Their hegemonic
strive for power serves the maximization of profits. In
this sense, nationalism appears as a quasi-religious justification.
Its true mission, however, is its service to the virtually divine nation-state
and its ideological vision which pervades all areas of
the society. Arts, science, and social awareness: none of them is
independent. A true intellectual enlightenment therefore needs a
fundamental analysis of these elements of modernity.

### Positivist Science

The paradigm of a positivist or descriptive science forms another
ideological pillar of the nation-state. It fuels nationalist ideology
but also laicism which has taken the form of a new religion. On
the other hand it is one of the ideological foundations of modernity
and its dogmata have influenced the social sciences sustainably.
Positivism can be circumscribed as a philosophical approach
that is strictly confined to the appearance of things, which it
equates with reality itself. Since in positivism appearance is reality,
nothing that has no appearance can be part of reality. We
know from quantum physics, astronomy, some fields of biology
and even the gist of thought itself that reality occurs in worlds
that are beyond observable events. The truth, in the relationship
between the observed and the observer, has mystified itself to
the extent that it no longer fits any physical scale or definition.
Positivism denies this and thus, to an extent, resembles the idol
worshipping of ancient times, where the idol constitutes the image
of reality.

### Sexism

Another ideological pillar of the nation-state is the sexism that
pervades the entire society. Many civilized systems have employed
sexism in order to preserve their own power. They enforced women's
exploitation and used them as a valuable reservoir of cheap
labour. Women are also regarded as a valuable resource in so far
as they produce offspring and provide the reproduction of men.
Thus, woman is both a sexual object and a commodity. She is a
tool for the preservation of male power and can at best advance
to become an accessory of the patriarchal male society.

On the one hand, the sexism of the society of the nation-state
strengthens the power of the men; on the other hand the nationstate
turns its society into a colony by the exploitation of women.
In this respect women can also be regarded as an exploited nation.

In the course of the history of civilization the patriarchy consolidated
the traditional framework of hierarchies, which in the
nation-state is fuelled by sexism. Socially rooted sexism is just
like nationalism an ideological product of the nation-state and
of power. Socially rooted sexism is not less dangerous than capitalism.
The patriarchy, however, tries to hide these facts at any
rate. This is understandable with a view to the fact that all power
relations and state ideologies are fuelled by sexist concepts and
behaviour. Without the repression of the women the repression
of the entire society is not conceivable. The sexism within the
nation-state society while on the one hand gives the male the
maximum power on the other hand turns the society through
the woman into the worst colony of all. Hence woman is the
historical-society's colony nation which has reached its worst
position within the nation-state. All the power and state ideologies
stem from sexist attitudes and behaviour. Woman's slavery
is the most profound and disguised social area where all types of
slavery, oppression and colonization are realized. Capitalism and
nation-state act in full awareness of this. Without woman's slavery
none of the other types of slavery can exist let alone develop.
Capitalism and nation-state denote the most institutionalized
dominant male. More boldly and openly spoken: capitalism and
nation-state are the monopolism of the despotic and exploitative
male.

### Religiousness

Even if it acts seemingly like a secular state, the nation-state does
not shy away from using a mélange of nationalism and religion
for its purposes. The reason is simple: religion still plays an important
part in some societies or parts of them. In particular Islam
is very agile in this respect.

However, religion in the age of modernity does no longer play
its traditional role. Whether it is a radical of a moderate belief,
religion in the nation-state does no longer have a mission in the
society. It can only do what it is permitted by the nation-state.
Its still existing influence and its functionality, which can be misused
for the promotion of nationalism, are interesting aspects for
the nation-state. In some cases religion even takes on the part of
nationalism. The Shi'ah of Iran is one of the most powerful ideological
weapons of the Iranian state. In Turkey the Sunni ideology
plays a similar but more limited part.

## The Kurds and the Nation-State

After the preceding short introduction into the nation-state and
its ideological basics we will now see why the foundation of a
separate Kurdish nation-state does not make sense for the Kurds.

Over the last decades the Kurds have not only struggled against
repression by the dominant powers and for the recognition of
their existence but also for the liberation of their society from the
grip of feudalism. Hence it does not make sense to replace the
old chains by new ones or even enhance the repression. This is
what the foundation of a nation-state would mean in the context
of the capitalist modernity. Without opposition against the capitalist
modernity there will be no place for the liberation of the
peoples. This is why the founding of a Kurdish nation-state is not
an option for me.

The call for a separate nation-state results from the interests of
the ruling class or the interests of the bourgeoisie but does not
reflect the interests of the people since another state would only
be the creation of additional injustice and would curtail the right
to freedom even more.

The solution to the Kurdish question, therefore, needs to be
found in an approach that weakens the capitalist modernity or
pushes it back. There are historical reasons, social peculiarities
and actual developments as well as the fact that the settlement
area of the Kurds extends over the territories of four different
countries which make a democratic solution indispensable.
Furthermore, there is also the important fact that the entire
Middle East suffers from a democracy deficit. Thanks to the
geostrategic situation of the Kurdish settlement area successful
Kurdish democratic projects promise to advance the democratization
of the Middle East in general. Let us call this democratic
project democratic confederalism.
