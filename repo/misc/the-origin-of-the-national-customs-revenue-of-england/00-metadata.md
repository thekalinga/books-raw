    The manuscript sources whuch I have consulted are as follows. At the Record
    Office in London: the Customs Accounts of the Exchequer, King's Remembrancer
    branch, cited as K. R. Customs; the Wardrobe Accounts, cited as K. R. Accounts;
    the Pipe Rolls; the Memoranda Rolls, and the Pipe Rolls of the Bishop of Winchester,
    oited as Ecclesistical Commission, Various.
    
    At the British Museum. various manuscript collections, especially the Harleian,
    About 20–25,000 Port Books (K. R. Port Books) were opened to the public early in
    the winter of 1911-12. By the courteay of the Record Office oficials, I was permitted
    to examine these documents even before they were made generally accessible. See
    my letter to the Athenæum, November 18, 1911, p. 625, and also my Memorandum
    on the Port Books and Coast Bonds in the Public Record Office, of December 12, 1911,
    privately circulated by the Royal Commission on Public Records.
