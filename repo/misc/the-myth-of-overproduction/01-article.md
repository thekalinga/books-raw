# The Myth of Overproduction

The "explanations" for the current
from all sides are numerous, but
the one most firmly established in
the popular mind is "overproduction."
Different persons, however, mean different
things by overproduction. The
least sophisticated mean simply that
there is just too much of everything
for the world's needs. This proposition
has merely to be plainly stated to reveal
its absurdity. It is a way of saying
that everybody is too wealthy
--- that we are all supplied with comforts
and luxuries to the point of satiety.

A more sophisticated form of the
doctrine of overproduction is that,
while there are not more goods being
produced than most of us desire, there
are more being produced than most of
us can afford to buy; in other words,
that the need for the goods exists, but
not the purchasing power. The first
thing to be said about this belief is
that, while it may often be true of
this or that specific commodity, it
can never be true of all commodities
taken together, because the purchasing
power for commodities consists ultimately
of commodities.

This is perhaps most clearly recognized
in international trade. We send,
say, raw cotton to Japan and take raw
silk in payment. To be sure, this statement
represents a violent oversimplification.
There is no direct barter; the
cotton is not credited to the American
grower directly in terms of its value
in silk, but both cotton and silk are
credited to their respective sellers in
terms of their value in a common
denominator --- gold. Each commodity
represents a part of the general balance
of payments between the two
countries. There need not even be any
direct trade balance between Japan
and the United States, but simply a
balance between each and the rest of
the world, with the adjustment made
through triangular exchange operations.
Gold shipments, short-term
credits and long-term loans combine
to make it unnecessary that this balance
be achieved in any one year.
Ultimately, however, it is goods that
buy goods, and this is as true of domestic
as of foreign trade. The farmer's
means of paying for a motor car
is foodstuffs, the motor car manufacturer's
means of paying for foodstuffs
is motor cars. If all the commodities
in the world could simultaneously
be doubled, the purchasing
power for them would be doubled by
the same stroke. It is vital that this
point should be clear, because not only
is the belief widespread that what we
are now suffering from is a general
overproduction, but some dangerous
policies are being suggested as a result
of this belief.

It has been proposed, for example,
that labor be immediately put on a
six-hour day and a four-day week.
This might be a desirable goal for the
distant future, but it would certainly
not provide a solution of the present
crisis. The workers whose time had
been cut in half would also have their
incomes cut proportionately. A general
immediate reduction to a twentyfour-hour
week, therefore, could only
reduce production all around the circle,
and leave everybody that much
worse off than before.

A still more sophisticated form of
the overproduction theory is that
which connects it with the question of
distribution. One form of the doctrine
is that income is too unequally distributed.
The wage earners get too little
and therefore cannot buy what the
factories turn out. This theory fails to
explain why the factories manufacture
a surplus of goods in the first
place. All goods are turned out to
meet either an actually existing, or an
anticipated, need. The anticipation of
this year's demand is based very
largely on last year's actual demand,
and if the demand for a certain volume
of goods did not exist last year
that volume is very unlikely to be produced
this year. Inequality in the distribution
of income, therefore, does
not in itself account for overproduction.

Another form of the doctrine holds
that the trouble is not merely that the
wage earners at the bottom do not receive
enough, but that the capitalists
and rentiers at the top have more
than they can spend. The latter are
obliged to save the surplus; that is,
they are obliged to invest it, directly
or through the medium of savings
banks and insurance companies, in
stocks and bonds --- in other words, in
the creation of new factories for making
more goods. The underpaid wage
earner's income is not expanding to
buy this constantly increasing product.

Broadly, this is the Marxian view of
crises. It fails to explain adequately,
however, why manufacturers should
borrow money or retain a surplus to
build new factories when the already
existing demand is being fully met
by existing factories. It also fails to
explain why the rate of interest on
capital has not fallen long ago to practically
nothing. To be sure, it is always
possible for manufacturers to become
unduly hopeful in erecting new plants,
but this mistake would be discovered
and corrected within a few years. Most
likely the mistake, if made on a
wholesale scale, would be discovered
through resulting depression. Even
so, the foregoing doctrine would not
explain how new demand constantly
arose not only to utilize the new factories
again but to lead to the creation
of still more factories.

The most defensible form of the
theory is that which connects overproduction
with shifts in distribution.
Let us assume that there is a period
in which the owners of businesses are
receiving larger profits and wage
earners lower wages --- in terms of purchasing
power --- than formerly. In
that case there already exists a productive
equipment to take care of a
certain mass demand. When that demand
is not forthcoming, temporary
stagnation results. This stagnation
may even be intensified because the
owners of businesses would probably
have been temporarily reinvesting at
least part of their increased income in
new capital undertakings.

Some students of the situation believe
that this is the explanation of the
present crisis. The immediate evidence,
however, does not clearly support this
belief. Even after allowance is made
for the increased cost of living, and
in spite of the fact that the actual
hours of the working week were lower,
the real weekly wages of factory
workers showed an increase of 42 per
cent in 1929 compared with 1914. The
index of such real weekly earnings in
twenty-four manufacturing industries,
as compiled by the National Industrial
Conference Board, was as
follows for the second quarter of each
year listed:

+------+-----+
| 1914 | 100 |
+------+-----+
| 1923 | 135 |
+------+-----+
| 1924 | 129 |
+------+-----+
| 1925 | 129 |
+------+-----+
| 1926 | 129 |
+------+-----+
| 1927 | 133 |
+------+-----+
| 1928 | 135 |
+------+-----+
| 1929 | 142 |
+------+-----+

Not only was there no decline in
factory wage rates in terms of living
costs over the seven-year period 1923--29, but there was an actual advance.
These figures, of course, do not in
themselves settle the question. We
should have to know the comparative
amount of net unemployment for each
year during the period, exactly how
great was the gain in industrial profits,
what happened to the real income
of farmers and the white collar classes,
and so on. All that can be said is
that, though we may make some
shrewd guesses, we do not yet know
precisely to what extent the shift in
the income of various classes within
the United States may have contributed
to the present crisis.

Must we, then, dismiss "overproduction"
entirely when it is cited as
the cause of the present, or even of
any previous, depression? We must
when the term is used to mean a _general_
overproduction, but when it refers
to a _specific_ overproduction the
case is different. Obviously, there are
some commodities that have been
overproduced in recent years. One of
the clearest examples is wheat, the
excess production of which
brought about partly by the World
War and partly by the Russian revolution.
When Russia's international
disorganization made it impossible for
her to supply wheat for the export
market, the other wheat-raising countries
of the world, principally Canada,
the Argentine, Australia and the
United States, greatly increased their
crops to make up the deficiency.

Outside Russia the mean annual
wheat production of the world from
1909 to 1913 was 1,807,000,000 bushels;
in the years from 1926 to 1930 it
was 2,433,000,000 bushels, an increase
of 626,000,000. Russia's average crop
in the years just preceding the war
was 757,000,000 bushels, or nearly 30
per cent of the total world crop. The
Russian crop fell in 1921 as low as
205,000,000 bushels; since then there
has been a rapid rise, and the crop
in 1930 was 1,032,000,000 bushels was even
larger than that which would be
called for by the pre-war proportions.
The demand, on the other hand, is
relatively fixed. The consumption of
wheat does not increase in the same
ratio as world purchasing power. The
man who has achieved a $10,000 annual
income does not eat ten times as
much bread as when he had a $1,000
income. Indeed, for people above the
starvation level the consumption of
bread is very little affected by changes
in wealth and income. The case for
the overproduction of wheat is clear.

But --- strange as this may appear
--- it is seldom easy to establish the existence
of a specific overproduction.
Certainly we cannot do so merely by
comparing the figures of the annual
production of a commodity without
reference to other factors. Take, for
example, the number of millions of
cigarettes turned out in the United
States for a series of years:

+------+---------+
| 1915 |  17,939 |
+------+---------+
| 1917 |  34,804 |
+------+---------+
| 1919 |  44,771 |
+------+---------+
| 1921 |  50,867 |
+------+---------+
| 1923 |  64,249 |
+------+---------+
| 1925 |  79,951 |
+------+---------+
| 1927 |  97,170 |
+------+---------+
| 1929 | 119,030 |
+------+---------+
| 1930 | 119,640 |
+------+---------+
| 1931 | 113,400 |
+------+---------+

Here the current production grew
each year by leaps and bounds; but
there has been no overproduction; the
price fluctuations have been minor,
and the cigarettes have been sold.

Whether any given commodity is
being produced in excess or not can
never be determined merely by knowing
the absolute volume of production,
but only by knowing the relation of
this production to the demand. In
1920, 75,000,000,000 cigarettes would
have represented a gross oversupply,
but today it would mean an enormous
"shortage."

Most producers complain of an
"oversupply" of their particular commodity
whenever their profits do not
satisfy them --- which means that they
complain of an "oversupply" most of
the time. And they are of course right
in so far as the price of their commodity
would be higher, and their
profits consequently greater, if their
competitors made less of it. From a
more objective standpoint, it may perhaps
be said that supply is "right"
when producers are making normal
profits, that there is a "shortage"
when they are making unusually high
profits, and a "surplus" when their
profits are unusually low or when
they are actually compelled to sell at
a loss. This, indeed, is in general the
sense in which these terms are used
by business men and in trade journals.
"Overproduction" here means
merely that more goods of certain
kinds are being produced than could
be sold at a profit. But does this
really tell us anything about specific
overproduction? Either a rise in costs
of production or a general fall in
prices or demand will affect profits
from a given product regardless of
whether or not there is a specific
oversupply of that product.

It is important to remember that
even if all wealth were equally divided
we should still at times probably
have overproduction of specific
goods, that is to say, unbalanced production.
And this problem of unbalanced
production, it must be pointed
out further, exists not merely under
a capitalist system but would exist
under communism, or even as applied
to a Crusoe on a desert island. It
would be foolish for such a Crusoe to
raise more vegetables than he could
eat. He would much better devote
part of his labor to fishing and hunting,
to improving his shelter or to
building a boat. Too much time given
to any one thing at the expense of
others would be a waste of labor.

This very delicate balance in the
production of innumerable goods and
services must be maintained in a great
society. Under capitalism the main
reliance for this balance is prices,
which under competitive conditions
perform --- not always satisfactorily
somewhat the same function as the
thermostatic control of an oil heater.
When a certain class of goods is being
"overproduced," the price falls. It
usually continues to fall until it is
below the cost of production of the
weaker or less efficient producers,
who are compelled to close down, thus
reducing the supply of that class of
goods. Unfortunately, if the particular
industry that has been overproducing
is a large one, the decline in
that industry will be likely to unsettle
other industries. If it is a manufacturing
industry it will hurt the raw
material producers by reducing its
purchase of raw materials; the stockholders
who lose dividends and the
workers who are thrown out of employment
will cut down their purchases
of other finished goods. This
process may spread in an ever-widening
circle, and thus produce an illusion
of "general overproduction."

It is often said that the real trouble
has become, not overproduction, but
underconsumption. Such a statement
seems on its face to be much nearer
the truth, but whether it is or not depends
on its implications in the mind
of the person who makes it. If he
means, as most persons who use the
phrase seem to mean, that people
have suddenly reduced their buying
merely through some perverse timidity,
he is greatly mistaken. The incomes
of many people have declined,
and the rest feel, justifiably, that
their incomes are less secure than
they were. Reduced retail buying is
therefore rather a consequence than a
cause of depression. The cure of depressions
is to be sought somewhere
else than in direct campaigns to stimulate
retail buying.

We may obtain some further light
on the question by analyzing some
special branch of trade --- say the
motor car industry. Let us begin
with a table of the annual production
of passenger cars:

+------+-----------+
| 1900 |     4,200 |
+------+-----------+
| 1905 |    24,600 |
+------+-----------+
| 1910 |   181,000 |
+------+-----------+
| 1915 |   895,900 |
+------+-----------+
| 1920 | 1,905,600 |
+------+-----------+
| 1923 | 3,753,900 |
+------+-----------+
| 1925 | 3,870,700 |
+------+-----------+
| 1926 | 3,948,800 |
+------+-----------+
| 1927 | 3,083,100 |
+------+-----------+
| 1928 | 4,012,100 |
+------+-----------+
| 1929 | 4,794,900 |
+------+-----------+
| 1930 | 2,910,200 |
+------+-----------+
| 1931 | 1,972,800 |
+------+-----------+

For many years the same type of
of situation existed in the motor car
industry that still prevails in the cigarette
industry --- a constant growth in
consuming demand in good years and
bad, far exceeding the growth in
population or in total purchasing
power. The "saturation point," however,
so long discussed by statisticians
and economists, has in the last few
years been approximately reached.
Hereafter the industry will find it
safest to count, not on new buyers,
but almost entirely on "replacement"
demand. The problem becomes: What
is now to be considered a "normal"
replacement demand?

The simplest --- though not quite the
most accurate --- way to calculate this
is to decide what is the average life of
an automobile and to divide the number
of years into the total number of
registered passenger cars. Thus there
are about 23,000,000 registered passenger
cars in the country. If the
average life of a car were four years
this would mean a replacement demand
of nearly 6,000,000 cars a year
--- far higher than the total has ever
reached. If the average life of a car
were six years the replacement demand
would still be nearly 4,000,000
cars a year, and it must be remembered
that a six-year average implies
keeping many cars on the road eight
and ten years or longer. Sales could
remain as low as those in 1931 only
on the absurd assumption that owners
could make their present cars last
an average of twelve years. Obviously
there has been no overproduction of
motor cars in the last two years; on
the contrary, by any statistical standard
it is reasonable to apply, there
has been a distinct shortage.

But now we begin to glimpse how
little production has to do with "need"
and how much with purchasing power.
Owners everywhere are keeping cars
in use that in other times would have
been junked long ago. Hundreds of
thousands of people would not buy
new cars now even if their present
cars should stop running altogether.
Here we see the fallacy of the whole
argument that revival is bound to
come when consumers are "obliged"
to buy new clothes because their old
ones have become too shabby, or when
railroads are "compelled" to replace
worn-out equipment and repair their
roadbeds. The theory does not tell us
where the buying power is to come
from. At least people in the automobile
industry can have this consolation:
when revival does set in there
will be, in addition to the ordinary
demand, a very heavy accumulated
demand for motor cars. Steel, too,
and other basic industries will benefit
from this deferred demand, as the
railroads as well as the motor-car
manufacturers again enter the market.
Yet there can be, of course, no
accumulated demand for cigarettes,
drinks, foodstuffs and such articles.

The most flagrant cases of overproduction
occur in agricultural products
and in raw materials rather than in
manufactured goods. One reason is
that manufacturers rarely produce
for a merely anticipated demand, but
wait for actual orders. The individual
farmer, however, is obliged to produce
what he can and take his
chances. His production is subject to
all the vagaries of nature --- drought,
excessive rainfall, frost, parching,
plant diseases, insect pests, tornadoes,
floods --- and if he escapes the worst of
these he may confront the even
greater disaster of excessive crops
and unsalable surpluses. Farming is
the most inelastic and the most unadjustable
industry on earth. That it
has been far more a victim of the current
depression than the manufacturing
industries is sufficiently shown
by the fact that agricultural prices
have declined much more violently
than prices of manufactured goods.
The somewhat facile apostles of economic
planning, who inform us so
often how they would regulate manufacturing,
might tell us more about
how they would solve the farmer's
vastly more baffling problem. But
whether they tell us or not, it is reasonably
clear from this brief survey
that to the extent that our present
troubles were brought about by abnormalities
of production, they are
the result of lack of balance in production
and not of "an oversupply of
everything."
