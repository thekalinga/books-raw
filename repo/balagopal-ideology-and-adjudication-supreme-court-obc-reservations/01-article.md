_A sad fact about the Indian
judiciary is that where the judges
have felt urgent ideological
compulsion they have not let
mere canons of discipline stop
them. Judgments by smaller
benches have prised open what
even a nine-judge bench has
declared to be the law to
such an extent that most of the
issues are again open for
rewriting. The judgment in
Ashoka Kumar Thakur vs Union
of India is a case in point._

\ 

Adjudication of public issues is an
ideological act. Courts say they do
their job within the four corners of
the law, but the four corners are only corners.
The space enclosed may be quite wide, and
can permit divergent tendencies, all of them
passing for interpretations of the law or the
Constitution. It is idle to pretend that this
divergence is the result of a pure difference
of a juridical character. There is considerable
politics in these divergent tendencies, when
social issues of significance are involved.

The vicissitudes of the law of reservations
after the supposedly authoritative pronouncement
in the _Mandal Commission case_
(lawyers know it as _Indira Sawhney vs
Union of India_) in 1992 make-up is a classic
instance. That judgment of nine judges, six of
them concurring in upholding the provision
of reservations to the Other Backward Classes
(_OBCs_) to the extent of 27% in central government
services, took a realistic view of
caste as an institution of Indian society, its
discriminatory character, the need to overcome
it, and the role special provisions
such as reservations can play in that task.

The Court formulated and answered all
the legal issues that have arisen over the
years in connection with reservations under
the Constitution. The judgment is one of
common sense, and succeeds in summing up
and trimming the rough edges of the positive
content of judicial views in the matter
over the previous 40 years, while going along
with some of the retrogressive attitudes.

Though in retrospect it is evident that
the judgment did open up space for mischief
by insisting on identifying some thing
called "a creamy layer" in every _OBC_ community,
and by expanding the space for judicial
meddling by mandating a fact-finding
enquiry of a public character by a statutory
body into putative backwardness, it was on
the whole as good a judicial pronouncement
as one could expect within the tradition
that views reservations as an instrument
for equalising educational and employment
opportunities at the threshold, while being
mindful of the supposed "injury" that it causes
to "efficiency" of the administration.

Reservations can be seen differently, as
one instrument for equalising the status and
position of castes considered as the basic
communities of Hindu society, but courts
have never seen it that way. Since judicial
discipline demands that only a larger bench
of judges can undo the result of any judgment,
and since no bench larger than nine
in size has gone into the question of reservations
or any aspect of it after the _Mandal
Commission case_, you would think that
things are at least where the _Mandal Commission
case_ left them. You would be terribly
mistaken, however. A sad fact about the
Indian judiciary is that where the judges
have felt an urgent ideological compulsion
they have not let mere canons of discipline
stop them. Judgments by much smaller
benches than nine have prised open what
the nine-judge bench declared to be the law
to such an extent --- while paying lip service
to their duty of obedience to it --- that most
of the issues are again open for rewriting.

_Ashoka Kumar Thakur vs Union of India_,
a judgment that is now at the centre of controversy
because its effect has been that seats
in central educational institutions supposedly
increased to meet the newly created
reservation of 27% for _OBCs_ have turned
into a bonanza of extra seats for the upper
castes, is a case in point. First, the reference
to a bench of five judges was unnecessary.

# Judicial Indiscipline

The order of reference by the two-judge
bench of Arijit Pasayat and Lokeshwar Singh
Panta is a textbook case of judicial indiscipline.
A whole list of questions (31, if you
want the number) were raised, almost all of
which were answered in the _Mandal Commission
case_ and indeed even much before
that, and asked to be answered by a Constitution
Bench. The only question that may
have justified such reference (that too only
because of unthinking judicial pronouncements
in the recent past) was whether
Parliament can by law direct private educational
institutions to give reservations to
the _OBCs_, which question was finally not
answered (except by one of the five judges)
on the ground that there was no challenge
from private educational institutions.

When the majority of the five-judge bench
came to that conclusion, they should have
returned the reference instead of answering
it, because there was never any doubt that
the government can provide for reservations
under the Constitution to _OBCs_ in educational
institutions owned or financially aided
by it. Instead, the blanket order of reference
was used by three of the five judges (Arijit
Pasayat himself, C K Thakker and Dalveer
Bhandari) to read the _Mandal Commission
judgment_ tendentiously, genuflecting with
due respect, but glossing it in a manner that
leaves the door open for a reversal in good
time. It is easy to see in it conduct most objectionable
in juridical terms, but what is
more significant is the ideological underpinning
of the indiscipline and its effect.

The significance of the "creamy layer" is
an instance of what they have achieved. In
the _Mandal Commission judgment_, the Court
performed the strange feat of deducing a
fact from an abstract principle, and declared
that there exists a creamy layer in each _OBC_
community, and it must be removed from
the benefit of reservation given to that
community so that the really backward
among the backward may not be deprived
of the benefits of special provisions. The
reasoning proceeds thus: unequals must
not be treated as equals; hence the well-endowed
among an _OBC_ community cannot
be counted with the less-endowed ones;
hence they must be disentitled to the reservation
provision made for that community
in the interests of justice; hence it is necessary
to identify the creamy layer in each
community and declare it ineligible for the
reservation given to that community. The
question, whether there, in fact, exists a
creamy layer as a sub-class within _OBC_
communities, if so in which of them, and
what is its effect on the availment of reservations
by members of the community,
whether, for instance, it has given confidence
to the others to aspire for higher positions
in life rather than come in the way of their
advancement, were matters of no relevance
to this process of deductive reasoning.

Nevertheless by the time of the _Mandal
Commission case_, caste as a social category
had come to be accepted by the courts as a
class of a kind, eligible for reservations if
it is backward. _Ashoka Kumar Thakur vs
Union of India_ (the judgment was pronounced
on 10 April 2008), through the
said three judges, introduces a revision:
caste becomes a class only after the
creamy layer is removed. Thus, the removal
of creamy layer is no longer a matter of
purported justice within the community
as between the more backward and the
less backward amongst it, as it was in the
_Mandal Commission case_, but a necessary
prerequisite for the caste to at all be a
class, and _a fortiori_ a backward class. This
is a very significant conceptual revision,
effected silently by a majority of this five-judge
bench in a reference that was unnecessary
in the first place.

Another instance is the way the same three
judges have smuggled in the "economic
criterion" for identifying backward classes.
They were not called upon to decide
whether caste can be the basis for determining
backwardness because after a lot
of dilly-dallying, the courts, which began
with the view that caste can be only one of
the criteria taken into account to identify
backwardness, have come round to the
view that if a caste is on the whole backward,
it can be identified as a backward
class, though there can be other ways of
identifying backward classes too. This
opinion has been approved in the _Mandal
Commission case_. But the three judges
proceed gamely to pose and answer the
same question notwithstanding its finality
(at least until more than nine judges sit and
reconsider it) and give different answers,
while declaring themselves bound by the
_Mandal Commission judgment_. They express
pain at the fact that poverty deprives
people of opportunity to pursue studies
and come up in life. It is in general remarkable
that about the only time courts in our
country have recognised the division of the
country into poor and rich and deplored
it, is when people have asked for caste-based
reservations or rights. They are otherwise
normally indifferent to economic
cleavages in society. And they will not
even learn from documented experience.

As far back as the 1960s, the government
of the then _State of Mysore_, the "native"
part of which had a systematic
programme of encouragement of the non-brahmin
communities in education and
employment in the pre-Constitution era,
strangely found itself stumbling upon the
Constitution (as understood by the Supreme
Court) in its effort to continue/extend the
measures after India dedicated itself to
social justice in the post-Constitution era.
It therefore introduced poverty-and-occupation-based
reservations pending the
success of its efforts to continue its programme,
while satisfying the finicky stipulations
of the Court. Reviewing this attempt,
the _Backward Classes Commission_
headed by O Chinnappa Reddy, which was
later appointed by the successor state of
Karnataka, found that it was the brahmins,
the lingayats and the vokkaligas that took
most of the benefits. That this would happen
would be obvious to anyone who
knows anything about Indian society, but
judges remain determined admirers of the
economic criterion. In _Ashoka Kumar
Thakur vs Union of India_, Arijit Pasayat and
C K Thakker have given the astonishing direction
that "to strike the constitutional
balance, it is necessary and desirable to
earmark certain percentage of seats out of
permissible limit of 27% for socially and
economically backward classes". And
Dalveer Bhandari directs that after 10
years the criterion for reservation must
shift to the economically backward. Wanting
in discipline or not, the effect is that a
majority of three out of the five judges in
the bench are found pushing for the economic
criterion in determining backwardness,
which will find its utility with the
kind of smooth lawyer that populates the
Supreme Court in the days to come.

Second, and this brings us to the present
controversy, the judgment answers questions
that nobody asked, which courts are
not supposed to do but find themselves
doing when they find governments doing
what they do not like, not as judges but as
political creatures. They were only supposed
to be adjudging the constitutional
validity of the _93rd Amendment_ which
has introduced _Article 15(5)_ in the
Constitution enabling the government to
make a special provision by law for the advancement
of backward classes insofar as
it relates to admissions to educational institutions
including private institutions, and
the validity of the consequential law made
by the Parliament, namely, the _Central
Educational Institutions (Reservations in
Admissions) Act, 2006_. In parenthesis, it
will be recalled that when the reservations
were mooted, the upper castes who have a
monopoly of higher education in the better
type of institutions, kicked up a big
fuss and blackmailed the government into
compulsorily increasing the number of
seats in every such institution so that the
opportunities available to them remain
untouched. In other words, they would
not share the opportunities that they
regard as theirs with the _OBCs_ and the
government had better not force them to
do so in its quest for real equality of oppor
tunity. That they succeeded in this blackmail,
but still went ahead and challenged
the law is an index of the kind of elite this
country has. Now, this increase of seats
and consequent infrastructure is estimated
to cost about Rs 17,000 crore. The blame for
the expenditure must squarely be placed
on the blackmailing tactics of the upper
castes and the union government's weakness
in succumbing to it. But the upper castes
generated an argument in their favour out
of this expenditure: should Rs 17,000 crore
be spent on implementing reservations in
higher education when primary schooling
is in very bad shape for want of funds? At
least one of the judges, Dalveer Bhandari,
found this crass hypocrisy impressive as
an argument against the law.

# Relaxing Criteria

What the Court was not called upon to
answer is whether and to what extent the
government or the educational institutions
may relax the qualifying marks to
enable the _OBC_ students to access the reservations,
and what is to be done if they
fail to access the seats in sufficient number.
It has been the general experience that the
first time that reservations are given to
any social class, not many are able to access
it and a sufficient relaxation of the
criterion of selection is needed to make
the reservation a reality. It is also a matter
of experience that the relaxation will not
be needed after a certain time. What is to
be done in this regard is a matter of government
policy, and while the courts may
be called upon to adjudicate the validity of
a policy once it is formulated, it is not for
them to say what it should be. But three
judges thought otherwise. Arijit Pasayat
and C K Thakker begin by properly asking
the central government to "examine the
desirability of fixing cut-off marks in respect
of candidates belonging to _OBCs_"
but add the uninvited illustration that "five
grace marks may be added to _OBC_ students".
And then go on to positively mandate that
if any seats in the _OBC_ quota remain vacant,
they shall be filled up by "candidates from
the general categories". Dalveer Bhandari
is more forthright. He orders that the qualifying
cut-off marks may be reduced by not
more than 10 (out of 100) for the _OBCs_, but
again if the qualif ying _OBC_ students fail to
avail the 27% reservation, "the remaining
seats would revert to the general category".
These orders that overstep the powers of
the Court have now come home to roost,
and in the process proved the vacuity of the
loud lament about the creamy layer that is
the most jarring note in the judgment: this
academic year the 27% _OBC_ quota has remained
largely unfilled in most of the central
educational institutions.

To begin with, the union government
took the initiative in leaving the policy to
the institutions. The Ministry for Human
Resources Development issued an office
memorandum (_OM_) dated 20 April 2008
authorising the central educational institutions
to "fix cut-off marks for admission/
selection through admission test, etc, for
the _OBC_ candidates with such differential
from the cut-off marks for the unreserved
category as each institution may deem appropriate
for maintaining the standards of
education and at the same time ensuring
that sufficient number of eligible _OBC_ candidates
are available". Maybe the decision
to leave it to the institutions was not very
wise for educational institutions of the
elite variety are the most steeped in brahminical
attitudes in our country. But good
or bad, the _OM_ still left it open for means
to be devised so that sufficient number of
_OBC_ students do enter the institutions. But
the Supreme Court again came in the way
without so much as acknowledging let
alone adjudicating the policy decision
taken by the union government. Someone
moved the Supreme Court for a "clarification"
in the matter and the Court, after
hearing the government too, which must
have informed it of the _OM_ dated 20 April
2008, passed an order on 14 October, approving
the policy pronouncement of
Dalveer Bhandari, namely, relaxation of
not more than 10 in the qualifying cut-off
marks and filling of unfilled seats by the
general category, "having regard to the
observations made in the judgments pronounced
by this Court". What observations?
Only Dalveer Bhandari made such an observation.
Arijit Pasayat and C K Thakker
said something else. Chief Justice
K G Balakrishnan whose contribution to
the _Ashoka Kumar Thakur case_ is scrupulous
in following the sympathetic spirit of
the _Mandal Commission judgment_, rightly
avoided making any policy pronouncement.
The last judge, R V Raveendran,
who expressed an impossible agreement
with all the other four, wrote a brief judgment
which too avoids the issue.

Yet, the same five judges sitting again endorse
what is a policy made by _judicial fiat_
by one of them, implicitly overruling the
government's policy decision without even
referring to it. The result is that the upper
castes who earlier had much of the 100% to
themselves now have more than 100%. The
urge the courts --- which remain a bastion of
the upper castes --- feel in the matter of
preempting what they believe to be un
desirable policy decisions in connection
with reservations is nowhere more evident.

It is not possible to conclude this without
commenting on the extraordinary interpretation
put by the _Jawaharlal Nehru University
(JNU)_ on the order of 14 October 2008
passed by the Supreme Court. It should be
obvious to even a child that what the Court
said was that if a student in general has to
get, say, 40 marks in the qualifying test or
interview or whichever combination of two
the institution prescribes, to be eligible for
selection to a course, then in the case of
_OBCs_ it will be sufficient if the candidate
gets 30 marks. It takes exceptional intelligence
to read it as anything else. But they
evidently possess that in that university. A
committee of five teachers concluded that
what the Supreme Court meant when it
spoke of relaxation of not more than 10 in
the cut-off marks was that the marks obtained
by an _OBC_ candidate must be within
10 marks of the least marks obtained by
those who have qualified in the general category
for the _OBC_ candidate to be eligible
for selection! Social scientists for some time
now have been speaking much of the legitimacy
of diverse "readings" of "texts" but
one does hope that in the _JNU_ they have not
carried it to misreading of plain English.
