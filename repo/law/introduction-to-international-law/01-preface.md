## PREFACE

The present seventh edition takes into account the changes and
developments that have occurred since the date (January 1967)
when the manuscript of the sixth edition was completed. The
object remains, as before, to present an introduction to international
law, not full or complete or exhaustive, but one
containing the fundamentals needed by those


(a) who are preparing to deal with the subject in actual
practice; or


(b) who, for some purpose or other, require a working
knowledge of it.

At the same time, within the limitations of these purposes,
every endeavour has been made to ensure that the treatment is
up to date.

The new multilateral Treaties and Conventions, calling for
treatment in the present edition, include such important law-making
instruments as the Vienna Convention of 1969 on the
Law of Treaties, the Convention of 1969 on Special Missions,
the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968, the
Treaty of 1971 on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of
Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction on
the Seabed and Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof, the
two Brussels Conventions of 1969 relating respectively to
Intervention on the High Seas in cases of Oil Pollution Casualties,
and Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, the Hague
Convention of 1970 on the Suppression of the Unlawful Seizure
of Aircraft (Hijacking), the Agreement of 1968 on the Rescue of
Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts, and the Return of
Objects Launched into Outer Space, and the Draft Convention
on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space
Objects, adopted in June, 1971, by the Legal Sub-Committee of
the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer
Space. Additions of such magnitude to the corpus of international
law in so short a period are without parallel in its
previous history. It is paradoxical that this has occurred at a
time when violence and instability appear to prevail to an
equally unprecedented degree throughout the world.

Apart from Treaties and Conventions, there have been a
number of important decisions, including those of the International
Court of Justice in the _North Sea Continental Shelf
Cases_ (1969), the Barcelona Traction Case (1970), and the
Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences for States of the
Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West
Africa) (1971).

Also, the law of the sea, seabed, and ocean floor stands on the
threshold of a complete recasting of its principles. A Conference
has been convened for the year 1973, and it is apparent
that the four Geneva Conventions of 1958 on the Law of the
Sea are no longer necessarily sacrosanct. Accordingly, the
subject has had to be treated in the context of this trend towards
basic revision.

A number of new matters receive attention in the present
edition. A short chapter, Chapter 13, has been added to deal
with the subject of Development and the Environment; the
concept of opposability in international law is treated for the
first time; and the status of "micro-States" is discussed.
Some opinions previously expressed have also been revised or
reformulated.

International law is now facing what, to employ current
jargon, is best described as a crisis of identity. As Dr. Edvard
Hambro, President of the Twenty-fifth Session of the United
Nations General Assembly in 1970, said in his address at the
opening of the Session :---

>The fragmentary international society of yesterday is
obsolete. We are now in a stage of transition, and we look
forward to the integrated community of tomorrow.
The future organisation of international society must be
based on agreed and accepted procedures for dealing with
international disputes, under more effective rules of international
law. Only thus can we protect the rights and the
human dignity of every person, regulate international commerce
and communications, ensure economic development and
improve social conditions in all countries.
