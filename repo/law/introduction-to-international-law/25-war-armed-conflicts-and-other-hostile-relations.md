## WAR, ARMED CONFLICTS AND OTHER HOSTILE RELATIONS

## GENERAL

The hostilities in Korea, 1950--1953,[^489/1] ending with the Armistice
Agreement of July 27, 1953, the fighting in Indo-China, 1947--1954,
and the conflict in and around the Suez Canal Zone
involving Israel, Egypt, France, and Great Britain in 1956,
finally confirmed a development in the practice of States which
has to some extent revolutionised the basis of those rules of
international law, traditionally grouped under the title, "the
law of War". For these were non-war armed conflicts.
Further confirmation of this development was furnished by the
hostilities in West Guinea between Indonesian and Dutch units
in April-July, 1962, by the border fighting between India and
the People's Republic of China in October-November, 1962,
by the hostilities in the Congo, 1960--1963, and by the India-Pakistan
armed conflict in September, 1965. None of these
cases received general recognition as involving a state of war.

The conflict in Vietnam is a special case. In the early stages,
the Vietnam hostilities could appropriately have been fitted
into the category of non-war armed conflicts. Since the
struggle escalated from about 1965 onwards into the dimensions
of a major local war, this non-war characterisation had
scarcely been possible. Indeed some of the participants
expressly referred to it as a "war" (e.g., the United States
President on April 30, 1971, in an address justifying the incursion
into Cambodia, the Khmer Republic).[^489/2] Opinions are
divided on the point whether the Vietnam conflict can be
correctly described as a civil war with heavy involvement of
outside States, or an international war, or a tertium quid of an
international conflict with some civil war characteristics.

The traditional rules hinged on the existence between
such States as came under the operation of the rules, of a
hostile relationship known as "war", and war in its most
generally understood sense was a contest between two or more
States primarily through their armed forces, the ultimate
purpose of each contestant or each contestant group being to
vanquish the other or others and impose its own conditions of
peace. Hence we have the well-respected definition of "war"
by Hall, judicially approved in Driefontein Consolidated Gold
Mines v. Janson[^490/1] :---

>When differences between States reach a point at which
both parties resort to force, or one of them does acts of violence,
which the other chooses to look upon as a breach of the peace,
the relation of war is set up, in which the combatants may use
regulated violence against each other, until one of the two has
been brought to accept such terms as his enemy is willing to
grant.

The Korean hostilities involved an armed conflict, at first
between the North Korean armies[^490/2] on the one hand, and
the South Korean Armies and armed forces of the United
Nations Command on the other hand, without any declared
status of war being involved. Yet this conflict was one on the
scale of a war as normally understood, and made it necessary
to bring into application many of the rules traditionally
applicable as part of the law of war. Prior to the Korean
conflict, there had been precedents of hostilities, not deemed
to be of the nature of war, among which may be instanced :---

(a) the Sino-Japanese hostilities in Manchuria, 1931--1932, and
from 1937 onwards in China;

(b) the Russo-Japanese hostilities
at Changkufeng in 1938; and

(c) the armed operations involving
(ostensibly) Outer Mongolian and Inner Mongolian forces at
Nomonhan in 1939.

A later example of a non-war armed
conflict, the Suez Canal zone hostilities in October-November,
1956, was indeed the subject of the following comment by the
British Lord Privy Seal (on November 1, 1956) :---

>Her Majesty's Government do not regard their present
action as constituting war ... There is no state of war, but
there is a state of conflict.

Before the outbreak of the Korean conflict, in 1950, States
had already to some extent foreseen the consummation of this
development of non-war hostilities.[^491/1] In 1945, at the San
Francisco Conference on the United Nations Charter, the
peace enforcement powers of the United Nations Security
Council were made conditional, not on the existence of a
recourse to war by a covenant breaking State as under Article 16
of the League of Nations Covenant, but on the fact of some
"threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression
(_see_ Article 39 of the Charter). In 1949, the Conventions
adopted by the Geneva Red Cross Conference dealing with
prisoners of war, the sick and wounded in the field, and the
protection of civilians were made applicable to any kind of
"armed conflict" as well as to cases of war proper.[^491/2]

The main reasons or conditions which have dictated this
development of non-war hostilities are :---

(a) the desire of States to preclude any suggestion of breach
of a treaty obligation not to go to war (e.g., the Briand-Kellogg
General Treaty of 1928 for the Renunciation of War,
under which the signatories renounced war as an instrument of
national policy);

(b) to prevent non-contestant States from declaring their
neutrality and hampering the conduct of hostilities by restrictive
neutrality regulations;

(c) to localise the conflict, and prevent it attaining the
dimensions of a general war.

Hence there must now be distinguished :---

(1) A war proper between States.

(2) Armed conflicts or breaches of the peace, which are
not of the character of war, and which are not necessarily
confined to hostilities involving States only, but may include
a struggle in which non-State entities participate.

The distinction does not mean that the second category of
hostile relations involving States and non-State entities is less
in need of regulation by international law than the first.

It is significant that coincidentally with the development of
the second category, as illustrated by the Korean conflict,[^492/1] the
nature of war itself has become more distinctly clarified as a
formal status of armed hostility, in which the intention of the
parties, the so-called _animus belligerendi_, may be a decisive
factor. Thus a state of war may be established between two
or more States by a formal declaration of war, although active
hostilities may never take place between themi; indeed, it
appears that of the fifty or more States which declared war
during the Second World War, more than half did not actively
engage their military or other forces against the enemy. Moreover
the cessation of armed hostilities does not, according to
modern practice, necessarily terminate a state of war.

The "status" theory of war was reflected in the anomalous
position of Germany and Japan during the years immediately
following their unconditional surrender in 1945 in accordance
with the formula decided upon during the War by the Big Three
---Great Britain, Russia, and the United States. Although both
countries were deprived of all possible means of continuing
war, and although their actual government was for a time
carried on by the Allies, they continued to be legally at "war"
with their conquerors. In 1947, in R. v. Bottrill, a certificate
by the British Foreign Secretary that the state of war continued
with Germany was deemed by the Court of Appeal to
be binding on the Courts.[^493/1] One object of prolonging this
relationship of belligerency, if only technically, was no doubt
to enable the machinery of occupation controls to be continued.
The absence of peace settlements with either of these ex-enemy
States was a further significant circumstance.

The definition of war given at the beginning of this chapter
sets out that it is a contest primarily between the armed forces
of States. The word "primarily" should be noted. As the
Second World War demonstrated, a modern war may involve
not merely the armed forces of belligerent States, but their
entire populations. In the Second World War economic and
financial pressure exerted by the belligerents on each other
proved only less important and decisive than the actual armed
hostilities. The wholesale use of propaganda and psychological
warfare also played a role which became ultimately more
decisive. Finally, to a far greater degree than combatants,
civilians bore the brunt of air bombardment and the rigours of
wartime food shortages.

The commercial or non-technical meaning of war is not
necessarily identical with the international law meaning.
Thus it was held by an English Court[^493/2] that the word "war"
in a charterparty applied to the "non-war" hostilities in
China in 1937 between Chinese and Japanese forces. The word
peace can similarly denote the termination of actual
hostilities, notwithstanding the continuance of a formal state of
war.[^494/1]

The question whether there is a status of war, or only a
condition of non-war hostilities, depends on :---

(a) the dimensions
of the conflict;

(b) the intentions of the contestants;
and

(c) the attitudes and reactions of the non-contestants.

As to (a), merely localised or limited acts of force fall short
of war.

As to (b), the intentions of the contestants are decisive if the
conflict concerns them only, and does not affect other States.
Hence, if there is a declaration of war, or in the absence of such
a declaration, the contestants treat the conflict as a war, effect
must be given to such intention; if, on the other hand, they are
resolved to treat the fighting as of the nature of non-war
hostilities, a state of war is excluded. An insoluble difficulty
arises, however, if according to the attitude of one or more
of the contestants, there be a state of war, whereas according
to the other or others there is no war. Recent State practice
(e.g., in the case of the India-Pakistan hostilities of September,
1965) is inconclusive on this point. _Prima facie_, a unilateral
attitude of one contestant that it is at war is intended as notice
of a claim of belligerent rights, with the expectation that third
states will observe neutrality; while a unilateral denial of war
operates as notice to the contrary.

As to (c), the policies of non-contestant States enter into
account when the conflict impinges on their rights and interests.
Assuming the hostilities are on a sufficiently extensive scale,
the decision may be made to recognise belligerency,[^494/2] or to
make a declaration of neutrality, irrespective of the intentions
of the contestants. A third State, adopting this course, would
be subject to the risk of the exercise against it of belligerent
rights by either contestant, whose right to do so could not then
be challenged. A non-war status could none the less still apply
in the relations of the contestants _inter se_.

### Rules of International Law governing "Non-War" Hostilities

Practice in the Korean conflict, 1950--1953, and the other
conflicts mentioned above, revealed the tendency of States to
apply most of the rules governing a war _stricto sensu_ to non-war
hostilities.[^495/1] As already mentioned, the Geneva Red
Cross Conventions of 1949 (for example, that relating to
prisoners of war) were in their terms expressly applicable to a
non-war armed conflict, while the Resolution adopted by the
United Nations General Assembly on December 16, 1969, with
regard to respect for human rights in armed conflicts, referred
to the necessity of applying the basic humanitarian principles
"in all armed conflicts".

But every such armed conflict must vary in its special
circumstances. It may be, for instance, that the States or
non-State entities opposed to each other in hostilities have not
made a complete severance of their diplomatic relations.
Again, they may or may not seek to blockade each other's
coasts. It cannot therefore be predicated of any future
armed conflict, not involving a state of war, that the entirety
of the laws of war automatically apply to it. Which rules of
war apply, and to what extent they are applicable, must depend
on the circumstances.

Moreover, in the case of a non-war armed conflict, as
to which the United Nations Security Council is taking enforcement
action, actual decisions or recommendations adopted by
the Security Council under Articles 39 _et seq._ of the United
Nations Charter, for the guidance of States engaged in the
hostilities, may fill the place of rules of international law.
Then one has to consider also the incidence of United Nations
peacekeeping operations", which are referred to in
Chapter 19, where recommendations of the General Assembly
play a primary role.

### Other Hostile Relations

Between a state of peace, on the one hand, and of war or
non-war hostilities, on the other hand, other gradations of
hostile relations between States are possible, but have to a
very limited extent only come within the ambit of international
law. An example is the state of opposition---the so-called
"cold war"---existing since 1946 between the Western and the
Communist groups of States.[^496/1] To a certain extent, this cold
war has already reacted on international law; for instance,
it has, on both sides, been considered to justify an unprecedented
interference with diplomatic agents of opponent
States, by procuring their defection and inducing the disclosure
of confidential material, and to justify also rigid limitations on
the freedom of diplomats. Moreover, the cold war has also
been thought to necessitate the extensive use of hostile propaganda,
directed by the members of one group against the
members of the other group, notwithstanding that the diplomatic
relations of the States concerned remain normal, while
other unfriendly action, such as cessation of non-discrimination,
has occurred.

One of the unprecedented elements in the cold war is the
so-called "balance of terror", which is nothing more or less
than the precarious equilibrium between the United States and
the Soviet Union in their possession and global deployment of
nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, and missiles. A crucial
question is to what extent this permits one of these States,
purporting to act for purposes of self-defence, in the absence
of an armed attack[^496/2] on it, and without the authorisation of the
United Nations Security Council, to take measures which
would otherwise be a breach of international law. This issue
lay behind the controversy over the legality of :---

(a) the flight
of the United States high-flying reconnaissance aircraft, the
U-2, over Russian territory in 1960, when it was detected and
shot down, and the pilot taken prisoner; and (b) the continued
surveillance of Cuban territory by United States aircraft in
October-November, 1962, for various purposes. It is
simplifying things to reduce the matter to an issue of whether
or not peace-time espionage is permissible. Under normal
circumstances, it is a violation of international law for the
Government aircraft of one State to enter the airspace of another
without that State's consent. If, then, these flights be legal,
the intensity of the cold war has wrought a fundamental change
in the rules of international law.

A concept of a new kind made its appearance in the period
1963--1966 in the shape of Indonesia's "confrontation" of
Malaysia, after the establishment of that new State in September,
1963. "Confrontation" involved action and policies to
undermine the integrity and position of Malaysia. It was
short-lived, being terminated by the signature on August 11,
1966 of an agreement of peace and co-operation (drawn up at
Bangkok, signed at Djakarta).

### Commencement of War or Hostilities

From time immemorial, State practices as to the commencement
of a war have varied. Down to the sixteenth century,
it was customary to notify an intended war by letters of defiance
or by herald, but the practice fell into disuse. In the seventeenth
century, Grotius was of the opinion that a declaration
of war was necessary, but subsequently several wars were
commenced without formal declaration. By the nineteenth
century, however, it was taken for granted that some form of
preliminary warning by declaration or ultimatum was necessary.

Many instances of State practice in the twentieth century
have been inconsistent with the rule. In 1904, Japan commenced
hostilities against Russia by a sudden and unexpected
attack on units of the Russian fleet in Port Arthur. Japan
justified her action on the ground that she had broken off
negotiations with Russia and had notified the Russians that
she reserved her right to take independent action to safeguard
her interests.

The Port Arthur incident led to the rule laid down by the
Hague Convention III of 1907, relative to the Opening of
Hostilities, according to which hostilities ought not to commence
without previous explicit warning in the form of either :---

(a) a declaration of war stating the grounds on which it was
based, or

(b) an ultimatum containing a conditional declaration
of war.

It was further provided that the existence of the state
of war should be notified to neutral States without delay and
should not take effect as regards them until after the receipt
of the notification which might, however, be given by telegraph.
Neutral States were not to plead absence of such notification
in cases where it was established beyond question that they
were in fact aware of a state of war.

Scant respect was paid to these rules in the period 1935--1945,
during which hostilities were repeatedly begun without prior
declaration.

### Legal Regulation of Right to Resort to War, to Armed Conflict, and to the use of Force

In the field of international law, one of the most significant
twentieth century developments has been the legal regulation
of the former unregulated privilege of States to resort to war,
or to engage in non-war hostilities, or to use force, and the
development of the concept of collective security. The latter
concept is essentially legal, as it imports the notion of a general
interest of all States in the maintenance of peace, and the
preservation of the territorial integrity and political independence
of States, which have been the object of armed aggression.
To quote Professor Bourquin[^498/1]: "A collective organisation of
security is not directed against one particular aggression, but
against war considered as a common danger".

The League of Nations Covenant (_see_ Articles 12--15) placed
primary emphasis on restricting the right of Member States
to resort to war, _stricto sensu_, in breach of certain obligations
connected with accepting the arbitration or judicial settlement
of certain disputes (more particularly those "likely to lead to
a rupture"), or the recommendations thereon of the League
of Nations Council. But in a secondary sense, the Covenant
precluded also certain kinds of recourse to non-war
hostilities, for example, in imposing an obligation upon States
to seek arbitration or judicial settlement of disputes which
might have entered the stage of active hostilities, and an
obligation to respect and preserve as against external agression
the territorial integrity and political independence of other
Member States (_see_ Article 10).

In 1928, under the Briand-Kellogg Pact (or, more precisely,
the Paris General Treaty for the Renunciation of War), the
States Parties agreed generally to renounce recourse to "war"
for the solution of international controversies, and as an instrument
of national policy. They also agreed not to seek the
solution of disputes or conflicts between them except by "pacific
means", thus covering no doubt non-war hostilities.

In terms, the United Nations Charter of 1945 went much
further than either of these two instruments, the primary
emphasis on war _stricto sensu_ having disappeared, while in its
stead appeared the conception of "threats to the peace",
"breaches of the peace" and "acts of aggression", covering
both war and non-war armed conflicts. In Article 2, as
already mentioned in Chapter 16,[^499/1] the Member States agreed to
settle their disputes by peaceful means so as not to endanger
peace and security and justice, and to refrain from the threat
or use of force[^499/2] against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any State. They also bound themselves to
fulfil in good faith their obligations under the Charter, which
include not only (a) the restriction that in the case of disputes
likely to endanger peace and security, they shall seek a solution
by the peaceful procedures set out in Articles 33--38; but also

(b) the obligation to submit to the overriding peace enforcement
functions of the Security Council, including the decisions
and recommendations that the Council may deem fit to make
concerning their hostile activities. This conception of peace
enforcement, not pre-determined in specific obligations under
the Charter, but to be translated _ad hoc_ into binding decisions
or recommendations of the Security Council which must be
accepted by States resorting to war or to hostilities, represented
the most striking innovation of the Charter.

In this connection, two aspects are of particular importance:

(1) The aspect of a war or resort to hostilities, involving
aggression.

(2) A resort to war or to hostilities which is in self-defence.

As to (1), apart from the power of the Security Council to
control "acts of aggression" under Article 39 of the Charter,
the judgments of the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals confirmed
the view that a war of aggression, or in violation of
international treaties, is illegal. The Tribunals went further
in also holding that the acts of "planning, preparation,
initiation, or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation
of international treaties" are international crimes engaging
the individual responsibility of those committing the acts.[^500/1]
The Tribunals' views were based on the Briand-Kellogg Pact
of 1928 (mentioned above), but international lawyers have
questioned the soundness of the judgments in view of State
practice prior to 1941.[^500/2]

An effective system of collective security must provide safeguards
against aggression.

The point of difficulty is to determine when a war is
"aggressive" for the purpose of the Nuremberg principles,
or when non-war hostilities may constitute "an act of aggression"
for the purpose of the peace enforcement functions
of the Security Council. If a State legitimately defends itself
against attack by another (_see below_), it is not guilty of waging
aggressive war, or of using aggressive force. But if a State
attacks the territorial integrity or political independence of
another State either in breach of treaty obligations, or without
any justification and with the wilful purpose of destroying its
victim, it is clearly guilty of aggression. In the period 1919--1939,
a great number of bilateral treaties of non-aggression
were concluded, and the draftsmen of these instruments
were far from overcoming the formidable difficulties involved
in the definition of aggression.[^501/1]

The dilemma of definition has remained to this day, as is
shown by the fact that the results of the labours of two Special
Committees, appointed by the United Nations General Assembly
in 1952 and 1954 respectively, to deal with the question of
defining aggression proved to be almost negative, while a
third Committee,[^501/2] the Special Committee on the Question of
Defining Aggression, set up by a Resolution adopted by the
General Assembly on December 18, 1967, has again experienced
difficulties in this connection and, as at the date of writing, has
not yet completed its mandate, which was to proceed with a
view to the preparation of an "adequate definition of aggression".
In its 1967 Resolution, the General Assembly referred
to "a widespread conviction of the need to expedite the definition
of aggression", and the point was reiterated in the
General Assembly's Resolution of November 25, 1970, dealing
with the Report of the Special Committee on its session in
1970, and affirming "the urgency of bringing the work of the
Special Committee to a successful conclusion and the desirability
of achieving the definition of aggression as soon as
possible". The Special Committee completed a fourth session
in February-March, 1971, and in the light of the progress so far
achieved and the common desire of the members to continue
their work, has recommended that the General Assembly
invite it to resume its work in 1972.[^501/3]

The Special Committee's work and discussions have ranged
over a wide field, and reflect some updating of the concept
of aggression in the light of the experience of the last decade.
Some weight of opinion both in the Special Committee and
in the General Assembly favours a "mixed definition" of
agression, in which a general descriptive formula would precede
and condition an enumeration of specific acts of aggression, this
list being by way of illustration rather than serving to cut down
the general formula, and would be without prejudice to the
overriding power of the United Nations Security Council to
characterise as an act of aggression some form of action not
corresponding to any of the enumerated items. Among the
concepts considered for incorporation in the definition of
aggression have been the following :---

(a) direct aggression, that
is conduct initiating or constituting the direct application of
force (e.g. declaration of war, invasion, bombardment, and
blockade);

(b) indirect aggression, represented, _inter alia_, by
the indirect use of force

(e.g. the sending of mercenaries or
saboteurs to another State, the encouragement there of subversive
activities by irregular or volunteer bands, and the fomenting
of civil strife in other countries);

(c) priority, that is the
significance to be attached to the first use of force;

(d) capacity
to commit aggression, namely whether the definition should
embrace aggression committed by States only or be extended
to cover aggression by other entities;

(e) the legitimate use of
force (e.g. by way of collective self-defence);

(f) aggressive
intent, representing a subjective test of aggression;

(g) proportionality,
involving a comparison of the degree of retaliation
with the extent of force or threat of force responded to.

One major difficulty in this regard is that each of the proposed
component concepts raises its own problems of definition,
none being so clear that precise limits can be drawn.

Notwithstanding the progress made by the present Special
Committee, it remains questionable whether a complete definition
is actually an attainable goal. Often, the matter is purely
one for appreciation by an international body,[^502/1] when tests or
criteria can be of more value than definitions. One useful test
of aggression is a repeated refusal to seek a settlement by peaceful
means.[^503/1]

As to (2)---the right of self-defence---the Charter by Article 51
recognises an inherent right of individual and collective self-defence
of Member States against armed attack, pending
enforcement action by the Security Council, and reserving to
the Security Council full authority in the matter. It appears
that consistently with Article 51, the North Atlantic Powers
could legitimately enter into their Regional Security Treaty of
April 4, 1949, and create the machinery beforehand for collective
self-defence should any one of their number be exposed to an
armed attack.[^503/2]

Qualified as it is by the reservation of ultimate authority
in the Security Council, the right of self-defence conceded by
Article 51 of the Charter differs in scope and extent from the
right of self-defence under customary international law.[^503/3] The
latter right was 'more restricted than the right of self-preservation,
normally understood, and allowed measures of
defence or protection only in the case of an "instant, overwhelming"
necessity, "leaving no choice of means, and no
moment for deliberation",[^503/4] provided that the measures used
were not unreasonable or excessive. Under Article 51 of the
Charter, the right of self-defence is framed as one in terms of
similar rights possessed by other States,[^503/5] and subject to conditions
as to its continued exercise. A matter of current
controversy is whether, under Article 51, nuclear and thermonuclear
weapons can legitimately be used in self-defence against
a non-nuclear armed attack. International lawyers are divided
upon the answer to this crucial question, some holding that
the use of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons is disproportionate[^504/1]
to the seriousness of the danger of a conventional
attack, while others say that in some circumstances a country
may be unable to defend itself adequately without recourse to
its nuclear armoury. Amore crucial point is the extent to which
States involved in a nuclear "crisis" may resort to measures of
self-defence, as did the United States when it proclaimed a
"selective" blockade of Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis
of 1962. Obviously, such a situation was beyond the contemplation
of the draftsmen of Article 51 of the Charter.

### Necessity of New Approach to Problem of Conflict Regulation

The impact of these problems of nuclear weapons, the
blurring of questions of responsibility by the overriding purpose
of restoring or maintaining peace and security, and the range
and variety of methods of pressure and coercion that may be
adopted by States to secure political ends have rendered it
difficult to work always with traditional concepts such as the
threat or use of force", "security", "aggression", and
"self-defence". For the new conditions, the United Nations
Charter embodying these concepts, is sometimes an imperfect
tool of conflict-regulation. A new approach is necessary if
this difficulty is to be overcome.

## EFFECTS OF OUTBREAK OF WAR AND OF ARMED CONFLICTS

The outbreak of war, as such, has far-reaching effects on
the relations between the opponent belligerent States.

At the outset, it is necessary to know what persons or things
are to be deemed of enemy character, as usually municipal
legislation will prohibit trading and intercourse with the enemy,
and provide for the seizure of enemy property.

The general rule of international law, as distinct from
municipal law, is that States are free to enact such legislation
upon the outbreak of war, and the same general rule must in
principle apply in the case of non-war armed conflicts, subject
to the qualification that where such a conflict comes under the
peace enforcement jurisdiction of the United Nations Security
Council, the States involved must abide by the Security Council's
decisions or recommendations.

Under the Geneva Convention of 1949 for the Protection of
Civilian Persons in Time of War, enemy nationals not under
confinement or in prison may leave the territory of a State at
war, unless the national interests of that State call for their
detention (Article 35). They are entitled to bring the matter
of refusal before a Court or administrative board of the detaining
Power. The Convention contains provisions forbidding
measures severer than house arrest or internment, and for the
proper treatment of internees.

In the following pages, the principal municipal and international
effects of war are broadly surveyed.

Not all these effects will necessarily apply in the case of a
non-war armed conflict. State practice during the Korean
conflict, 1950--1953, and the Suez Canal zone hostilities of 1956,
revealed wide divergencies concerning State attitudes in this
connection. It would seem from such practice that, in the
event of a non-war armed conflict, the contesting States
will not hold themselves bound to apply the same stringent
rules as they would in the case of a war proper, and that, in
particular, they will not necessarily to the same extent interrupt
or suspend their diplomatic intercourse and their treaty
relationships, but will make such adjustments as the special
circumstances of the conflict require, and will---if necessary---
follow the guidance of the United Nations Security Council and
General Assembly through their decisions or recommendations.

### Enemy Character in War

As to individuals, State practice varies on the test of enemy
character. British and American Courts favour residence or
domicile as against the Continental rule which generally
determines enemy character according to nationality.[^506/1] But as
a result of exceptions grafted on these two tests, Anglo-American
practice has tended to become assimilated to the
Continental practice, and there is now little practical difference
between them.

Hostile combatants, and subjects of an enemy State resident
in enemy territory are invariably treated as enemy persons,
and residence in territory subject to effective military occupation
by the enemy is assimilated for this purpose to residence in
enemy territory.[^506/2] According to Anglo-American practice even
neutrals residing or carrying on business in enemy territory are
also deemed to be enemy persons, while on the other hand
subjects of an enemy State resident in neutral territory are not
deemed to have enemy character. However, by legislation
adopted in two World Wars, the United States and Great
Britain have made enemy influence or associations the test of
enemy character, whether the persons concerned are resident
in enemy or in neutral territory.

In the case of Daimler Co., Ltd. v. Continental Tyre and
Rubber Co. (Great Britain), Ltd.,[^506/3] the House of Lords adopted
the test of enemy associations or enemy control for corporations
carrying on business in an enemy country but not incorporated
there, or corporations neither carrying on business nor incorporated
there but incorporated in Great Britain itself or a
neutral country. It was ruled that enemy character may be
assumed by such a corporation if "its agents or the persons in _de
facto_ control of its affairs" are "resident in an enemy country,
or, wherever resident, are adhering to the enemy or taking
instructions from or acting under the control of enemies".
This was an extremely stringent principle, and the decision has
received a good deal of criticism. A company, incorporated
in Great Britain, which acquires enemy character under the
Daimler principle, is none the less not deemed to have its
location in enemy territory; it is for all other purposes a
British company, subject to British legislation, including
regulations as to trading with the enemy.[^507/1] Apart from the
Daimler ruling, it is clear law that a corporation incorporated
in an enemy country has enemy character.[^507/2]

As regards ships, _prima facie_ the enemy character of a ship
is determined by its flag.[^507/3] Enemy-owned vessels sailing under
a neutral flag may assume enemy character and lose their
neutral character if :---

(a) they take part in hostilities under the
orders of an enemy agent or are in enemy employment for
the purpose of transporting troops, transmitting intelligence,
etc., or

(b) they resist legitimate exercise of the right of visit
and capture. All goods found on such enemy ships are
presumed to be enemy goods unless and until the contrary is
proved by neutral owners.

As to goods generally, if the owners are of enemy character,
the goods will be treated as enemy property. This broad
principle was reflected in the various wartime Acts of countries
of the British Commonwealth, prohibiting trading with the
enemy and providing for the custody of enemy property.

### Diplomatic Relations and War

On the outbreak of war, diplomatic relations between the
belligerents cease. The Ambassadors or Ministers in the
respective belligerent countries are handed their passports, and
they and their staffs proceed home. Under Article 44 of the
Vienna Convention of 1961 on Diplomatic Relations, the
receiving State must grant facilities enabling such persons to
leave at the earliest possible moment, placing at their disposal
the necessary means of transport.

### Treaties and War

The effect of war on existing treaties to which the belligerents
are parties is, to quote Mr. Justice Cardozo, "one of the
unsettled problems of the law".[^508/1] According to the older
authorities, such treaties were annulled _ipso facto_ between the
belligerents as soon as war came. So sweeping a view is now
discounted by the modern authorities, and is inconsistent with
recent State practice according to which some treaties are
considered as annulled, others are considered as remaining in
force, and others are held to be merely suspended, and to be
revived on the conclusion of peace.[^508/2]

In the unsettled state of the law, it is difficult to spell out
any consistent principle or uniformity of doctrine. To quote
Mr. Justice Cardozo again, international law "does not
preserve treaties or annul them, regardless of the effects
produced. It deals with such problems pragmatically, preserving
or annulling as the necessities of war exact". Two
tests are applicable in this connection. The first is a subjective
test of intention-did the signatories of the treaty intend that
it should remain binding on the outbreak of war? The second
is an objective test-is the execution of the treaty incompatible
with the conduct of war ?

Applying these tests, and having regard to State practice
and the views of modern authorities, we may sum up the
position as follows :---

(1) Treaties between the belligerent States which presuppose
the maintenance of common political action or good relations
between them, for example, treaties of alliance, are abrogated.

(2) Treaties representing completed situations or intended to
set up a permanent state of things, for example, treaties of
cession or treaties fixing boundaries, are unaffected by war and
continue in force.

(3) Treaties to which the belligerents are parties relating to
the conduct of hostilities, for example, the Hague Conventions
of 1899 and 1907 and other treaties prescribing rules of warfare,
remain binding.

(4) Multilateral Conventions of the "law-making" type
relating to health, drugs, protection of industrial property,
etc., are not annulled on the outbreak of war but are either
suspended, and revived on the termination of hostilities, or
receive even in wartime a partial application.

(5) Sometimes express provisions are inserted in treaties to
cover the position on the outbreak of war. For example,
Article 38 of the Aerial Navigation Convention, 1919, provided
that in case of war the Convention was not to affect the freedom
of action of the contracting States either as belligerents or as
neutrals, which meant that during war the obligations of the
parties became suspended.[^509/1]

(6) With regard to other classes of treaties, e.g., extradition
treaties[^509/2] in the absence of any clear expression of intention
otherwise, _prima facie_ these are suspended.

Where treaties are suspended during wartime, certain
authorities claim they are not automatically revived when
peace comes, but resume their operation only if the treaties
of peace expressly so provide.[^509/3] Practice is not very helpful on
this point, but usually clauses are inserted in treaties of peace,
or terminating a state of war, to remove any doubt as to which
treaties continue in force.

### Prohibition of Trading and Intercourse in War; Contracts

Trading and intercourse between the subjects of belligerent
States cease on the outbreak of war, and usually special
legislation is introduced to cover the matter. The details of
State practice in this connection lie outside the scope of this
book, but it can be said that international law gives belligerent
States the very widest freedom in the enactment of municipal
laws dealing with the subject.

Similarly with regard to contracts between the citizens of
belligerent States, international law leaves States entirely free
to annul, suspend, or permit such contracts on the outbreak
of war. Consequently this is a matter primarily concerning
municipal law, and will not be discussed in these pages. There
is some uniformity of State practice in the matter, inasmuch as
most States treat as void, executory contracts which may give
aid to or add to the resources of the enemy, or necessitate
intercourse or communication with enemy persons, although
as regards executed contracts or liquidated debts, the tendency
is not to abrogate, but to suspend the enforceability of such
obligations until the state of war is terminated.[^510/1]

### Enemy Property in War

The effect of war on enemy property differs according as
such enemy property is of a public nature (i.e., owned by the
enemy State itself), or of a private nature (i.e., owned by private
citizens of the enemy State).

#### (a) Enemy Public Property

A belligerent State may confiscate
movable property in its territory belonging to the enemy
State. Where the enemy movable property is located in
enemy territory under military occupation by the forces of that
State, such property may be appropriated in so far as it is
useful for local military purposes. Immovable property (i.e.,
real estate) in such territory may be used (for example, occupied
or used to produce food or timber) but not acquired or disposed
of.[^510/2] Ships of war and other public vessels at sea belonging to
the enemy State may be seized and confiscated except those
engaged in discovery and exploration, or in religious,
scientific, or philanthropic missions or used for hospital
duties.

#### (b) Enemy Private Property

The general practice now of
belligerent States is to sequestrate such property in their
territory (i.e., seize it temporarily) rather than to confiscate it,
leaving its subsequent disposal to be dealt with by the peace
treaties. It is not certain whether there is a rule of international
law prohibiting confiscation as such, and authorities are somewhat
divided on the point. But private property in occupied
territory must not be taken, or interfered with, unless it is of
use for local military purposes,[^511/1] for example, for goods and
services necessary for the army of occupation; mere plunder
is prohibited. In contrast to the substantial protection of
enemy private property on land, enemy ships and enemy
cargoes at sea are liable to confiscation. This does not apply
to enemy goods on a neutral merchant vessel unless such goods
are useful for warlike purposes, or unless they are seized as a
reprisal of war for continuous breaches by the enemy of the
rules of warfare.[^511/2]

### Combatants and Non-Combatants

Combatants are divided into two classes :---

(a) lawful, and

(b) unlawful.

Lawful combatants may be killed or wounded
in battle or captured and made prisoners of war. Certain
categories of lawful combatants, for example, spies as defined
in Article 29 of the Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention
IV of 1907 on the Laws and Customs of War on Land,
are subject to special risks or disabilities,[^511/3] or specially severe
repressive measures if captured. Unlawful combatants are
liable to capture and detention, and in addition to trial and
punishment by military tribunals for their offences.[^512/1] Citizens
of, or persons owing allegiance to one belligerent State, and who
have enlisted as members of the armed forces of the opposing
belligerent, cannot claim the privileges of lawful combatants if
they are subsequently captured by the former belligerent
State.[^512/2]

Traditionally international law maintains a distinction
between combatants and non-combatants, inasmuch as non-combatants
are not in principle to be wilfully attacked or
injured. Certain classes of non-combatants, for example,
merchant seamen, may however be captured and made prisoners
of war. Nineteenth century official pronouncements affirmed
that the only legitimate object of war was to weaken the military
forces of the enemy. In 1863 the following passage appeared
in United States Army General Orders :---

>The principle has been more and more acknowledged that
the unarmed citizen is to be spared in person, property, and
honour as much as the exigencies of war will admit.

A valiant attempt to draw a distinct line between civilians and
the armed forces was also made in the Hague Convention IV
of 1907 on the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its
annexed Regulations. Yet under the demands of military
necessity in two World Wars, the distinction seems now to
have become almost obliterated.

A learned author[^512/3] has examined the present-day importance
of the distinction under the heads of :---

(i) artillery bombardment;

(ii) naval bombardment;

(iii) sieges;

(iv) blockade;

(v) contraband; and

(vi) aerial bombardment, and has reached
the conclusion in essence that while non-combatants may not
be the primary objects of these six operations of war, they are
denied material protection from injury thereunder.

On the subject of aerial bombardment, the history of attempts
to protect non-combatants has not been encouraging. The
Hague Regulations of 1907 mentioned above (_see_ Article 25)
prohibited the attack or bombardment of undefended towns,
villages, etc., by "any means whatever", and this phrase was
intended to cover aerial attacks. But during the First World
War the rule laid down was not respected. In 1923 a Commission
of Jurists at The Hague drew up a draft Code of Air
Warfare, which did not come into force as a Convention, and
which provided _inter alia_ that bombardment was legitimate
only when directed at specified military objectives such as
military forces, works, and establishments, and arms factories,
and was forbidden when bombardment could not take place
without the indiscriminate bombardment of civilians. The
Spanish Civil War of 1936--1938 showed that it was not sufficient
merely to prohibit air attack on specified military objectives,
and a Resolution of the League of Nations Assembly in 1938
recommended a subjective test that the intentional bombing of
civilians should be illegal. But up to the stage of the outbreak
of the Second World War, States had not definitely agreed on
rules for the limitation of aerial bombardment.

During that War, the Axis Powers bombed civilians and
civilian objectives, using explosive bombs, incendiary bombs,
and directed projectiles. The Allies retaliated eventually with
area and pattern bombing, and finally in 1945 with atom-bomb
attacks on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, resulting in enormous
civilian casualties. Whether regarded as legitimate reprisals
or not, the Allied air bombardments were like the similar Axis
attacks, directed at civilian morale. It would be unrealistic in
the light of these events, not to consider that in modern total
war civilian morale has become a true military objective. Indeed
it is becoming more and more difficult in total war to define
negatively what is not a military objective. Besides, the so-called
civilian "work forces", or "quasi-combatants", that
is to say those civilians employed in the manufacture of tools of
war, were considered to be targets as important as the armed
forces proper.

An attempt was made in the Geneva Convention of 1949
for the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War to shield
certain classes of civilian non-combatants from the dangers
and disadvantages applicable to combatants and non-combatants
in a war or armed conflict. The Convention does not
purport to protect all civilians,[^514/1] but mainly aliens in the
territory of a belligerent and the inhabitants of territory subject
to military occupation, although other classes receive incidental
protection under the provisions allowing the establishment of
hospital, safety, and neutralised zones, and for insulating from
the course of hostilities such persons as the sick and aged,
children, expectant mothers and mothers of young children,
wounded, and civilians performing non-military duties. Also
in the Convention are provisions that civilian hospitals properly
marked should be respected and not attacked.[^514/2]

The very necessity of such detailed provisions as the Convention
contains shows that little remains of the traditional
distinction between combatants and non-combatants save the
duty not to attack civilians in a wanton or unnecessary manner,
or for a purpose unrelated to military operations, and to abstain
from terrorisation.

In 1950, the International Committee of the Red Cross
requested States to prohibit the use of atomic, and indiscriminate
or so-called "blind" weapons. Subsequently it
drew up a set of Draft Rules "to Limit the Risks Incurred by
the Civilian Population in Time of War", and which went much
further. These Draft Rules were submitted to the 19th Conference
of the Red Cross at New Delhi in 1957 and approved,
but follow-up work with Governments did not lead to the conclusion
of a new Convention. Tlie question was raised again
at the 20th Conference of the Red Cross at Vienna in 1965 which
adopted a Resolution affirming four principles, three cf which
declared that the right of a contestant to use means of injuring
the enemy was not unlimited, that attacks against the civilian
population as such were prohibited, and that the distinction
between combatants and the civilian involved sparing the latter
as much as possible. These principles were affirmed in a
Resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on
December 19, 1968 in regard generally to the protection of
human rights in armed conflicts.[^515/1]

The legality of the atom-bomb attacks by the United States
on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, referred to above, is questionable.
They have been variously justified as :---

(a) A reprisal, although
the casualties inflicted were quite out of proportion to those
caused by single instances of illegal air bombardments committed
by the Axis Powers.

(b) As terminating the war quickly
and thereby saving both Allied and enemy lives, which would
be equivalent to relying on the doctrine of military necessity.
Neither ground is satisfactory as a matter of law.[^515/2]

If there were objections to the original atom-bomb, these
apply with greater force to the hydrogen bomb, and to the new
highly developed nuclear and thermonuclear weapons. The
dangers and uncontrollable hazards involved in such mass
destruction weapons led to the conclusion of four treaties
which are dealt with in other Chapters of this book, namely
the Nuclear Weapons Test Ban Treaty of 1963, the Outer
Space Treaty of 1967 (_inter alia_, banning nuclear weapons in
outer space), the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty
of 1968, and the Treaty of 1971 Prohibiting the Emplacement
of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction
on the Seabed and Ocean Floor.[^516/1]

## THE "LAWS OF WAR"[^516/2]

The "laws of war" consist of the limits set by international
law within which the force required to overpower the enemy
may be used, and the principles thereunder governing the
treatment of individuals in the course of war and armed conflict.
In the absence of such rules, the barbarism and brutality
of war would have known no bounds. These laws and customs
have arisen from the long-standing practices of belligerents;
their history goes back to the Middle Ages when the influence
of Christianity and of the spirit of chivalry of that epoch combined
to restrict the excesses of belligerents. Under present rules
such acts as the killing of civilians, the ill-treatment of prisoners
of war, the military use of gas, and the sinking of merchant
ships without securing the safety of the crew are unlawful.

Since the nineteenth century, the majority of the rules have
ceased to be customary and are to be found in treaties and
Conventions. Among the most important of these instruments
are the Declaration of Paris, 1856, the Geneva Convention,
1864, the Declaration of St. Petersburg, 1868, the Hague
Conventions of 1899 and 1907, the Geneva Gas and Bacteriological
Warfare Protocol, 1925, the Submarine Rules Protocol,
1936, and the four Geneva Red Cross Conventions, 1949,
namely, those dealing with prisoners of war, sick and wounded
personnel of armies in the field and of forces at sea, and the
protection of civilians, and which effected a far-reaching revision
and codification of a major portion of the "laws of war".

The essential purpose of these rules is not to provide a code
governing the "game" of war, but for humanitarian reasons
to reduce or limit the suffering of individuals, and to circumscribe
the area within which the savagery of armed conflict is
permissible. For this reason, they are sometimes known as
the "humanitarian law of war", or the rules of "humanitarian
warfare". True, these rules have been frequently and extensively
violated, but without them the general brutality
of warfare would have been completely unchecked. It would
be unrealistic, in this connection, to overlook the impact of
the so-called "push-button" warfare of the future, conducted
by directed missiles, nuclear weapons, etc. This tendency to
the depersonalisation of war, the very antithesis of its humanisation,
constitutes a grave threat to the very existence of the
"laws of war".

In practice, the military manuals of the different States contain
instructions to commanders in the field embodying the
principal rules and customs of war.[^517/1]

Inasmuch as the "laws of war" exist for the benefit of
individuals, it would appear that in the case of an unlawful
conflict, waged by an aggressor State, these rules nevertheless
bind the State attacked and members of its armed forces in
favour of the aggressor and its armed forces. However, the
aggressor State may be penalised to the extent that, during the
course of the conflict, neutral or non-contestant States may
discriminate against it, or by reason of the fact that at the
termination of hostilities it may have to bear reparations or to
restore territory illegally acquired. The rules of course must
apply as well to non-war armed conflicts (they have been
recognised as applicable in the current Vietnam conflict).

The laws of war are binding not only on States as such, but
on individuals, including members of the armed forces, Heads
of States, Ministers, and officials.[^517/2] They are also necessarily
binding upon United Nations forces engaged in a military
conflict, mainly because the United Nations is a subject of
international law and bound by the entirety of its rules, of which
the laws of war form part. There is also the consideration
that if United Nations forces were not so bound, and became
involved in operations against a State, the forces of the latter
would be subject to the laws of war, but not United Nations
forces.

Unless a treaty or customary rule of international law otherwise
provides, military necessity does not justify a breach of
the laws of war.[^518/1]

### Sanctions of Laws of War; War Crimes

While the laws of war are frequently violated, international
law is not entirely without means of compelling States to
observe them. One such method is the reprisal, although it is
at best a crude and arbitrary form of redress.[^518/2] Another
sanction of the laws of war is the punishment both during and
after hostilities of war criminals, following upon a proper trial.

In that connection, the trials of war criminals by Allied
tribunals after the Second World War provided significant
precedents.

First, there were the trials, 1945--1948, of the major war
criminals at Nuremberg and Toyko respectively by the International
Military Tribunals. These trials have been referred
to in an earlier Chapter.[^518/3] To consolidate the precedent
represented by the trials, the International Law Commission
of the United Nations prepared, in 1950, a Draft Code of
Offences against the Peace and Security of Mankind, embodying
the Nuremberg principles, and the General Assembly of the
United Nations has been sponsoring, partly through the Commission
and partly through a special Committee, the establishment
of a permanent International Criminal Court to try
persons guilty of such offences, and also of the offence of
genocide. On November 26, 1968, the General Assembly
adopted a Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory
Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity,
obliging parties to abolish existing limitations on prosecution
and punishment for such crimes, and to take measures otherwise
to ensure their non-application.

Second, there were the trials by Allied Courts of offenders
other than the Axis major war criminals. Such accused
included :---

(a) persons prominently involved in war conspiracies
(for example, industrialists, financiers), who were
indicted for the same crimes as the major war criminals,

(b)
members of the enemy forces and civilians charged with ordinary
offences against the laws of war (i.e., ordinary war crimes), and

(c) the so-called "quislings" or "collaborationists" guilty
of treason. The variety and geographical range of the tribunals
which tried the offenders were without precedent; these included
national military tribunals, special tribunals constituted for the
purpose (composed of professional judges or jurists),[^519/1] the ordinary
municipal civil Courts, and even international military
tribunals, while the trial venues were located in Europe, Asia,
Australia, and even in the South Pacific.

Prior to the trials, it had been recognised that a belligerent
was entitled to punish for war crimes those members of the
armed forces of its opponent who fell into its hands, or who
had committed such crimes within its territorial jurisdiction.
Not every
violation of the rules of warfare is a war crime, and
some jurists support the view that the term should be limited
to acts condemned by the common conscience of mankind,
by reason of their brutality, inhumanity, or wanton disregard
of rights of property unrelated to reasonable military necessity.
Some such conception of a war crime emerges from the decisions
of the different tribunals, referred to above, a conception
which has received a flexible application, as shown in
the decisions that the following persons could be guilty of war
crimes :---

(a) Civilians, as well as members of the forces.

(b) Persons not of enemy nationality, for example, those
having enemy affiliations.

(c) Persons guilty of a gross failure
to control subordinates responsible for atrocities.[^520/1]

It appears clearly established also by these trials (_see_, for
example, the judgment of the Nuremberg Court) that orders
by superiors, or obedience to national laws or regulations, do
not constitute a defence, but may be urged in mitigation of
punishment.[^520/2] In 1921, in the case of the Llandovery Castle,[^520/3] a
German Court found the accused guilty of killing defenceless
persons in lifeboats in the First World War, and rejected the
plea of superior orders, stating that the plea was inadmissible
if the order were "universally known to be against the law"
but that such order might be an extenuating circumstance.
Probably Courts must take into account the state of the mind
of the accused; if he believed that the order was lawful, this
belief might be a defence, but not if the order were obviously
illegal. So, just as in ordinary criminal law, the question of
mens rea is important. As the Nuremberg Court pointed out,
the true test is "whether moral choice was in fact possible"
on the part of the individual ordered to commit the criminal act.[^520/4]

One further sanction of the laws of war should not be overlooked.
This is contained in Article 3 of the Hague Convention
IV of 1907 providing that if a belligerent State violate
any such laws, that State is to pay compensation, and to be
responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of
its armed forces. Under this Article a substantial indemnity
may be exacted when the treaty of peace is concluded.

### Rules of Land, Sea, and Air Warfare

The principal rules as to land warfare[^520/5] are set out in the
Hague Convention IV of 1907 on the Laws and Customs of
War on Land, and its annexed Regulations. These Regulations
are sometimes for the sake of convenience referred to as
the "Hague Rules" or "Hague Regulations". They define
the status of belligerents, i.e., those who will be treated as
lawful combatants. Guerrilla troops and militia or volunteer
corps like the British Home Guard in the Second World War
are subject to the laws, rights, and duties of war if they satisfy
four conditions, namely that they are properly commanded,
have a fixed distinctive emblem recognisable at a distance,
carry arms openly, and conduct their operations in accordance
with the laws and customs of war. Where there are _levées en
masse_, i.e., organised or spontaneous risings of the civilian
population against the enemy, those called to arms by the
authorities must fulfil the four conditions just mentioned in
order to be respected as lawful combatants, whereas those
spontaneously taking up arms on the approach of the enemy
need only satisfy the two conditions of carrying arms openly,
and respecting the laws and customs of war. The Geneva
Prisoners of War Convention of 1949 (_see_ Article 4) provides
that the troops of organised resistance movements are entitled to
be treated as prisoners of war if they satisfy the above-mentioned
four conditions, and even if they operate in occupied
territory.[^521/1] No such privilege as regards operations in occupied
territory is conceded to _levées en masse_.

The Hague Rules of 1907 also contained provisions relative
to the treatment of prisoners of war. The humane treatment
of these and other captives is now dealt with in the Geneva
Convention of 1949, superseding a Geneva Convention of 1929,
which itself replaced the Hague Rules. The 1949 Convention
contains a code of provisions, more appropriate for twentieth
century wars and armed conflicts than the earlier instruments.[^521/2]
Strict duties are imposed upon a Detaining Power of treating
prisoners of war humanely, and there are special provisions
for ensuring that they are not exposed to unnecessary brutality
during the immediate aftermath of capture when their captors
may attempt to procure information useful for the conduct of
operations. On humanitarian grounds, it was also provided
in the Convention that prisoners of war should be released
and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active
hostilities (_see_ Articles 118--119). These stipulations were
presumably based on the assumption that prisoners would
desire to return to the homeland; in the course of the negotiations
for a truce in the Korean conflict, 1951--1953, a new
problem[^522/1] emerged when the United Nations Command
ascertained by the so-called "screening" of thousands of
prisoners in its custody that, owing to fear of persecution,
many were unwilling to be repatriated. Claims of humanity
had to be weighed against the danger in the future of unscrupulous
belligerents affecting to make spurious "screenings"
of captives, and the possibility that, under pretext of political
objections to repatriation, prisoners of war might be guilty of
treason. A compromise, giving due emphasis to grounds of
humanity, was reached in the Korean Armistice Agreement
of July 27, 1953 (_see_ Articles 36--58).[^522/2]

The same Conference which adopted this Convention, also
adopted in place of earlier instruments :---

(a) A Convention on
Wounded and Sick Members of the Armed Forces in the Field,
containing detailed provisions requiring belligerents to protect
wounded and sick personnel, and to respect the medical units
and establishments normally caring for such personnel. (b) A
Convention on Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked Members of
the Armed Forces at Sea, dealing with the cognate problem of
wounded, sick, and shipwrecked personnel at sea, and providing
_mutatis mutandis_ for similar duties of respect and
protection. The latter Convention is notable for the important
provisions relating to hospital ships, which drew upon the
experience of the Second World War.[^523/1]

Methods and means of combat and the conduct of hostilities
are dealt with in Section II of the Hague Rules of 1907. Certain
methods and means of war are forbidden, for example, the use
of poisoned weapons, or arms or projectiles which would cause
unnecessary suffering, or the refusal of quarter. Ruses of war
are permitted,[^523/2] but, according to general practice, not if tainted
by treachery or perfidy, or if in breach of some agreement
between the belligerents. As already mentioned, undefended
towns are not subject to bombardment (Article 25). During
the last War there were several declarations of "open cities"
(for example, Paris in 1940, Manila in 1941, and Rome in 1943),
a term which really corresponds to the expression "undefended
towns" as used in the Hague Rules, with the additional feature
that the city is quite open and free for entry by the attackers.
Military objectives in an undefended city not so open and free for
entry may be bombarded from the air. Attacking officers must
give warning before commencing a bombardment of defended
places, except in case of an assault, and must spare distinctly
marked churches, hospitals, monuments, etc. Pillage is forbidden.

The rules of naval warfare[^523/3] are contained partly in rules of
customary international law, partly in the Declaration of Paris
of 1856, partly in the Hague Conventions of 1907, Nos. VI,
VII, VIII, IX (Naval Bombardment), X, XI, and XIII (Neutral
Rights and Duties in Maritime War), and partly in the London
Submarine Rules Protocol of 1936. In maritime warfare,
belligerents are entitled to capture enemy vessels and enemy
property. Surface ships, submarines, and aircraft engaged in
sea warfare may destroy enemy merchant shipping provided
that, except in the case of a persistent refusal to stop or
resistance to search, the safety of the crew, passengers, and
ship's papers must be definitely assured. Merchant ships are
entitled to defend themselves against attacks at sight, not
conforming to these rules. Privateering, i.e., the commissioning
of private merchant vessels, is illegal (_see_ Declaration of
Paris, 1856). Merchant ships may be lawfully converted into
warships, provided, according to British practice, that the
conversion is effected in a home port, and not while the vessel
is at sea or in a neutral port. Auxiliary vessels may be treated
as being of a combatant character if they are part of the naval
forces, being employed to assist naval operations.

Under the Hague Convention IX (Naval Bombardment),
the naval bombardment of undefended ports, towns, etc., is
prohibited unless the local authorities refuse to comply with a
formal requisitioning demand for provisions and supplies.
Otherwise, military works, military or naval establishments,
and other military objectives may be attacked.

Floating mines must not be sown indiscriminately, and it is
the duty of belligerents laying such mines not merely to take all
possible precautions for the safety of peaceful navigation, but
to notify the precise extent of minefields as soon as military
considerations permit. Unfortunately the law as to mines is
uncertain because of the weakness of the text of the Hague
Convention VIII (Submarine Contact Mines), and because
of the development of new types of mines and new kinds of
minelaying methods.

As to the rules, if any, concerning aerial warfare, _see above_.[^524/1]
There are no rules of international law prohibiting the use of
psychological warfare, or forbidding the encouragement of
defection or insurrection among the enemy civilian population.

Finally it should be mentioned that by the above-mentioned
Geneva Protocol of 1925, gas and bacteriological warfare are
prohibited (_see also_ Draft Convention of the Commission
of Disarmanent, 1930),[^525/1] and that by the International Convention
for the Protection of Cultural Property in the event of
Armed Conflict, signed at The Hague in May, 1954, measures
of protection against the ravages of war are provided for works
of art, monuments, and historic buildings.[^525/2]

### Law of Belligerent Occupation of Enemy Territory[^525/3]

Belligerent occupation must be distinguished from two other
stages in the conquest of enemy territory :---

(a) invasion, a
stage of military operations which may be extended until
complete control is established; and

(b) the complete transfer
of sovereignty, either through subjugation followed by annexation,
or by means of a treaty of cession. Occupation is
established only by firm possession, or as Article 42 of the
Hague Rules of 1907 says, only when the territory is "actually
placed under the authority of the hostile army".

The distinction from invasion is important, inasmuch as
the occupant Power is subject to a number of rights and duties
in respect to the population of the occupied territory.
Important also is the point that belligerent occupation does
not displace or transfer the sovereignty of the territory but
involves the occupant Power in the exercise solely of military
authority subject to international law. For this reason,
occupation does not result in any change of nationality of the
local citizens nor does it import any complete transfer of
local allegiance from the former Government. Nor can occupied
territory be annexed. The occupant Power's position is that
of an interim military administration, which entitles it to
obedience from the inhabitants so far as concerns the maintenance
of public order, the safety of the occupying forces,
and such laws or regulations as are necessary to administer the
territory.

Lawful acts of the occupant Power will therefore normally
be recognised when the occupation is terminated; but not
unlawful acts (for example, the wholesale plunder of private
property).

The rational basis of the international law as to belligerent
occupation is that until subjugation is complete and the issue
finally determined, the occupant Power's authority is of a
provisional character only.

The status of Germany after the Second World War following
on the unconditional surrender appears to have involved a
stage intermediate between belligerent occupation and the
complete transfer of sovereignty ((6) above). The four
Allied Powers, Great Britain, France, Russia and the United
States exercised supreme authority over Germany, and in the
opinions of some writers, this could not be regarded as a
belligerent occupation because of the destruction of the former
Government, and the complete cessation of hostilities with the
conquest of the country. Nor, since the occupying Powers
were acting in their own interests, were they trustees in any
substantive sense for the German people. At the same time,
it should be pointed out that the Allied control system was
expressly of a provisional character, not involving annexation,
was predominantly military in form, and based on the
continuance of the German State as such, and on the continuance
also of a technical state of war. However, the
question is now somewhat academic, except as a precedent for
the future, owing to the establishment of separate West and
East German Governments.[^527/1]

The rights and duties of the occupant Power are conditioned
primarily by the necessity for maintaining order, and for
administering the resources of the territory to meet the needs
of the inhabitants and the requirements of the occupying forces,
and by the principle that the inhabitants of the occupied
territory are not to be exploited. The rules with regard to
public and private property in the occupied territory are
referred to above.[^527/2] The inhabitants must, subject only to
military necessities, be allowed to continue their lawful occupations
and religious customs, and must not be deported.
Requisitions for supplies or services must be reasonable, and
not involve the inhabitants in military operations against their
own country. Contributions are not to be exacted unless
ordinary taxes and dues are insufficient for the purposes of the
administration. These and other rules are set out in Section III
of the Hague Rules of 1907.

The provisions of the Hague Rules were supplemented by
the Geneva Convention of 1949 on the Protection of Civilian
Persons in Time of War (_see_ Part III, Section III, Articles 47--78).
In the interests of the inhabitants[^527/3] of occupied territory, and
having regard to the experience of military occupations in two
World Wars, numerous carefully defined duties were imposed
upon occupying Powers by the Convention, duties qualified in
certain particular cases by the requirements of internal security
and order, and by the necessities of military operations;
among such duties are the obligations :---

(a) Not to take
hostages,[^528/1] or impose collective penalties against the population
for breaches of security or interference with the occupying
forces by individual inhabitants;

(b) not to transfer by force
inhabitants, individually or en masse, to other territory or to
deport them;

(c) not to compel the inhabitants to engage in
military operations or in work connected with such operations,
other than for the needs of the occupying army; and

(d) not to
requisition food and medical supplies, so as to impinge upon
the ordinary requirements of the civilian population.

The
Convention also imposes, subject to the same qualifications, a
specific obligation to maintain the former Courts and status
of Judges, and the former penal laws, and not to use coercion
against Judges or public officials.

Neither the Hague Rules nor the Convention purport to
deal with all the problems of an occupying Power. There are
noticeable deficiencies in regard to economic and financial
matters. For example, what are the duties of the occupying
Power in regard to Banks, public finance, and the maintenance
or use of the former currency or introduction of a new currency?
_Semble_, here, the occupying Power must follow the principle of
ensuring orderly government, which includes the proper safeguarding
of the economic and financial structure, but excludes
any attenipt to obtain improperly any advantage at the expense
of the inhabitants of the occupied territory.

Finally, as to the question of duties of obedience (if any)
owed by the civilian population towards the occupying Power,
it is clear that for conduct prejudicial to security and public
order, for espionage, and for interference with military operations,
inhabitants are subject to penalisation by the occupying
Power. However, the notion of allegiance due by the inhabitants
to the occupying Power was rejected by the Geneva
Convention of 1949 on the Protection of Civilian Persons in
Time of War (_see_ Articles 67--68). It appears that, in relation
to the population, the occupying Power may prohibit certain
activities by the population in the occupied territory, subject
to due public notice of what is prohibited, notwithstanding
that it has occupied the territory concerned following upon an
act of aggression which was a crime under international law.[^529/1]

## MODES OF TERMINATING WAR AND HOSTILITIES

State practice in the present century renders necessary a
distinction between :---

(1) Modes of termination of the status of war.

(2) Modes of termination of hostilities which are continuing
in a war _stricto sensu_, and of the hostilities in a non-war
armed conflict.[^529/2]

#### (1) Modes of Termination of the Status of War

The following are the principal ways of termination :---

(a) Simple cessation of hostilities by the belligerents without
any definite understanding being reached between them.
Illustrations are the wars between Sweden and Poland (1716),
between France and Spain (1720), between Russia and Persia
(1801), between France and Mexico (1867), and between Spain
and Chile (1867). The disadvantage of this method is that it
leaves the future relations of belligerents in doubt, and is not
appropriate for modern conditions under which complicated
questions of property, _matériel_, prisoners of war, and
boundaries have to be resolved usually by treaty.

(b) Conquest followed by annexation. The governing
principle here is that a country conquered and annexed ceases
to exist at international law; hence there cannot be a state of
war between it and the conqueror. It is not clear how far
this principle now applies where the annexed State was vanquished
in a war of gross aggression, illegal under international
law.[^530/1] For example, in the case of Ethiopia and Czechoslovakia,
annexed in 1936 and 1939 by Italy and Germany respectively,
the Allied Powers refused to recognise the territorial changes
thus illegally brought about, but these were both cases where
independence was restored within a reasonably short time.

(c) By peace treaty. This is the more usual method. A
treaty of peace generally deals in detail with all outstanding
questions concerning the relations of the belligerents, for
example, evacuation of territory, repatriation of prisoners of
war, indemnities, etc. On all points concerning property on
which the treaty is silent, the principle uti possidetis ("as
you possess, you shall continue to possess ') applies, namely,
that each State is entitled to retain such property as was
actually in its possession or control at the date of cessation of
hostilities. There also applies the postliminium principle, in
the absence of express provision, to the rights of the parties
other than to property; that is to say, that any prior condition
and prior status are to be restored; hence, legal disabilities of
former alien enemies are removed, diplomatic relations are
reconstituted, etc.

(d) By armistice agreement, where the agreement although
primarily intended to bring about a cessation of hostilities,
operates subsequently as a result of its practical application
by the parties _de facto_ to terminate the status of war. This,
it is believed, is largely a question of construction of the
particular armistice agreement concerned.[^530/2]

(e) By unilateral declaration of one or more of the victorious
Powers, terminating a status of war.[^530/3] This seemingly anomalous
procedure was adopted by certain of the Allied Powers
(including Great Britain and the United States) in 1947 and
1951 respectively towards Austria and the West German
Republic, principally because of irreconcilable disagreement
with the Soviet Union over procedure and principle in regard
to the conclusion of peace treaties.

**Municipal Law and the Termination of War.**---The date of
termination of a war, according to a particular State's municipal
law is not necessarily the same as the date of the peace treaty,
or the date of cessation of hostilities.[^531/1] There is no rule of
international law precluding the municipal law of any belligerent
State from adopting a date different to that in the treaty, unless
there be express contrary provision in the treaty itself.

#### (2) Modes of Termination of Hostilities

The following modes of terminating hostilities, as distinct
from the status of war itself, are applicable to hostilities both
in a war, and in a non-war conflict :---

(a) By armistice agreement. Strictly speaking, an armistice
is but a temporary suspension of hostilities, and normally
signifies that hostilities are to be resumed on the expiration of
the armistice period. Armistices may be, on the one hand,
general, when all armed operations are suspended; or on the
other hand, partial or local, being then restricted to portions
only of the armed forces engaged, or to particular areas only
of the operational zones. One modern trend in regard to
general armistices, however, is that they represent no mere
temporary halting of hostilities, but a kind of _de facto_ termination
of war, which is confirmed by the final treaty of peace.[^531/2]
In the case of a non-war armed conflict, as, for example, the
Korean conflict, 1950--1953, the armistice puts an end to
the conflict, and it may also be that a final peaceful settlement
is contemplated by the contending parties.[^531/3]

(b) Unconditional surrender or other forms of general
capitulation, unaccompanied by any agreement or treaty,
containing terms of peace. The formula of unconditional
surrender was adopted by the Allies in the Second World War
for the reasons, _inter alia_, that it was deemed impossible to
negotiate with the Axis Governments, that it was necessary to
preclude any suggestion of a betrayal of the enemy armed forces
by civilian Governments, and to enable a process of re-education
and democratisation of the enemy populations to be undertaken
for a time under military controls, while a formal state of
war continued.

(c) By a "Truce" so-called. The term has been used in
United Nations practice (for example, the Truce established
in Palestine in May-June, 1948, as a result of action by the
Security Council). It probably indicates a less definitive
cessation of hostilities than the term "Armistice".[^532/1]

(d) Cease-Fire. The term more frequently used for a
cessation of hostilities on the order or request of the United
Nations Security Council or other international organ is
"cease-fire"; for example, the cease-fire ordered by the
Security Council in December, 1948, on the occasion of the
renewal of hostilities in Indonesia between the Netherlands and
the Indonesian Republican forces, the cease-fire of October 13,
1961, between the United Nations Force in the Congo and the
armed forces of Katanga,[^532/2] and the cease-fire in the India-Pakistan
conflict "demanded" by the Security Council in its
resolution of September 20, 1965. The general effect of a
cease-fire is to prohibit absolutely hostilities and operations
within the area subject of the order or agreement, and during
the period of time stipulated.

(e) Agreement of cessation or suspension[^532/3] of hostilities;
for example, the three Geneva Agreements of July 20, 1954,
on the cessation of hostilities respectively in Vietnam, Laos, and
Cambodia, which ended the fighting in Indo-China between
Government and Viet Minh forces.

(f) By joint declaration of the restoration of normal, peaceful,
and friendly relations between the contestants; e.g., the
Tashkent Declaration, January 10, 1966, as to the India-Pakistan
Conflict (this included terms as to withdrawal-lines
of armies, and as to prisoners).[^533/1]

### General

One unsatisfactory feature of the Second World War and its
aftermath has been the undue prolongation of the period
between cessation of hostilities and the conclusion of a peace
treaty.[^533/2] This has left certain conquered States subject to an
uncertain regime, intermediate between war and peace, a
possibly recurrent situation for which some solution should be
found by international law.



[^489/1]: _See below_, pp. 616--617.

[^489/2]: The United States point of view, in justification of the incursion, was,
_inter alia_, that as North Vietnam and the Vietcong had violated Cambodia's
neutrality, the United States as a "belligerent" was entitled to protect her
security by way of self-preservation.

[^490/2]: Later including armed forces described in the Armistice Agreement as the

[^491/1]: The difference between the outbreak of war and the commencement of
"non-war" hostilities was also recognised in the United Nations General
Assembly Resolution of November 17, 1950, on "Duties of States in the
Event of the Outbreak of Hostilities" (such duties being to avoid war, note
withstanding the commencement of an armed conflict). _See also_ the Resolution
of the General Assembly of December 16, 1969, on respect for human rights
in armed conflicts, which refers to the necessity of applying the basic humanitarian
principles "in all armed conflicts".

[^491/2]: _Cf._ also the use of the expression "armed conflict" in Articles 44 and 45
of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of April 18, 1961 (facilities
to enable diplomatic envoys to leave, protection of legation premises, etc.).

Gugliormella v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. (1954), 122 F. Supp. 246
(death in Korean hostilities 1950--1953 is the result of "an act of war").
Also the "war" represented by non-war hostilities ends with the termination
of such hostilities; _see_ Shneiderman v. Metropolitan Casualty Co.(1961), 220
N.Y.S. (2d) 947.

[^494/1]: _See_ Lee v. Madigan (1959), 358 U.S. 228 (words "in time of peace" in
Article 92 of the Articles of War).

[^494/2]: _See above_, pp. 165--167.

[^495/1]: The United Nations Command in the Korean conflict 1950--1953 declared
its intention of observing the "laws of war", and the Geneva Red Cross
Conventions of 1949. These were also observed in the Vietnam conflict, to
which of course the Geneva Conventions had application.

[^496/1]: The "cold war" is not a war, for the purpose of determining who are
enemy aliens; _see_ decision of Supreme Court of Alabama in Pilcher v. Dezso
(1955), _American Journal of International Law_ (1955), Vol. 49, p. 417.

[^500/1]: _See_ Principle VI of the Draft Code of Offences against the Peace and
Security of Mankind, drawn up by the International Law Commission.

[^500/2]: E.g., the United States Proclamation of neutrality in 1939 on the outbreak
of war, professing amity with the belligerents; if the Tribunals were right, by
such Proclamation the United States was in effect condoning the illegality of
Germany's aggression against Poland.

[^501/1]: _See_, e.g., definition of "arrgession" in the Soviet Conventions of 1933
for the Definition of Aggression, Article II; Keith, Speeches and Documents on
International Affairs, 1918--1937, Vol. I, pp. 281--282.

[^501/2]: In 1957, the General Assembly had established a Committee to study the
comments of Governments in order to advise the Assembly when it would be
appropriate to resume consideration of the question of defining aggression.
This Committee held a number of meetings, including a session in April-May
1967, some six months before the above-mentioned General Assembly Resolution
of December 18, 1967.

[^501/3]: _See_ generally the Report of the Special Committee on its session February |March
5, 1971; text of its recommendation at p. 21.

[^502/1]: In the case of the Korean conflict in 1950, the Security Council determined
that the action of the North Korean forces constituted a "breach of the peace"
(_see_ Resolution of June 25, 1950). However, the United Nations Commission
in Korea in its report to the General Assembly on September 4, 1950, described
this as an "act of aggression".

[^503/1]: In 1951, the International Law Commission held it undesirable to define
aggression by a detailed enumeration of aggressive acts, since no enumeration
could be exhaustive. It favoured the view that the threat or use of force for
any reason or purpose other than individual or collective self-defence, or in
pursuance of a decision or recommendation of a competent United Nations
organ was aggression; _see_ Report on the Work of its Third Session (1951),
For the best and most comprehensive treatment of the problem
of the definition of aggression, and of other aspects of aggression, _see_ Stone,
Aggression and World Order (1958), which deals with the subject in its historical
context to the end of 1957.

the Charter, _see_ Beckett, The North Atlantic Treaty, the Brussels Treaty, and
the Charter of the United Nations (1950).

for treatment of such right of self-defence.

"Caroline" Case (1837), as to which _see_ Oppenheim, International Law
(8th Edition, 1955), Vol. I, pp. 300--301.

[^503/5]: _Cf._, Joan D. Tooke, The Just War in Aquinas and Grotius (1965), at p. 234.
pp. 8--10.

[^504/1]: Proportionality and self-defence: It is generally accepted that measures
of self-defence should not be disproportionate to the weight and degree of an
armed attack; this was seemingly recognised by the U.S. Government at the
time of the Gulf of Tonkin incident, August, 1964, its armed action being
officially described as a "limited and measured response fitted precisely to the
attack that produced it".

[^506/1]: _See_ leading case of Porter v. Freudenberg, (1915) 1 K.B. 857, affirming the
test of residence in enemy territory as determining enemy status.

[^506/2]: _See_ Sovfracht (VIO) v. Van Udens Scheepvaart, (1943] A.C. 203.

N.Y. 222. _See also_ Karnuth v. U.S. (1929), 279 U.S. 231.

[^508/2]: _Semble_, belligerent States may even contract new treaties (through the
auspices of neutral envoys) relevant to their belligerent relationships. Th
United States practice during the Second World War was contrary to any
principle of automatic abrogation of treaties by war; _see_ McIntyre Legal
Effect of World War II on Treaties of the United States (1958).

[^509/1]: _Cf._ Article 89 of the International Civil Aviation Convention, 1944. It
may also appear that, apart from express provision, it was the intention of the
parties that the treaty should not operate in time of war, in which event effect
will be given to that intention.

[^509/2]: _See_ Argento v. Horn (1957), 241 F. (20) 258. This case also shows that the
parties may conduct themselves on the basis that a treaty is suspended.

[^509/3]: _Cf._ however, Argento v. Horn, _supra_.

[^510/1]: _See_ Arab Bank, Ltd. v. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas),
(1953] 2 Q.B. 527, and [19541 A.C. 495, and Bevan v. Bevan, [1955] 2 Q.B. 227.

[^510/2]: It may also be destroyed, if it is of a military character (e.g., barracks,
bridges, forts), and destruction is necessary in the interests of military
operations (_cf._ Article 53 of the Geneva Convention, 1949, on the Protection
of Civilian Persons in Time of War).

[^511/1]: The occupant Power cannot seize property, such as stocks of petroleum,
for the purposes not of the occupying army, but for its needs generally at home
or abroad; _see_ decision of Court of Appeal, Singapore, in N. V. De Bataafsche
Petroleum Maatschappij v. The War Damage Commission, _American Journal
of International Law_ (1957), Vol. 51, p. 802.

Public Prosecutor, [1969] 1 A.C. 430 (saboteurs attired in civilian clothes, and
who are members of the regular armed forces of one belligerent, are not
entitled to be treated as lawful combatants by the opposing belligerent, if
captured).

1965, Vol. I, pp. 119--139.

[^514/2]: _See_ Article 14 and following Articles.

[^515/1]: In a further Resolution on the same subject adopted on December 16, 1969,
the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General of the United Nations
to give special attention in his study of the matter to the need for protection of
the rights of civilians and combatants in struggles for self-determination and
liberation, and to the better application of the existing Conventions and rules
to these conflicts.

[^515/2]: Apart from the legality of the attack on civilians, the use of atom bombs
could be questioned on the ground that they involved "poisonous" substances,
viz., radio-active fall-out (_see_ Article 23 of the Regulations annexed to
the Hague Convention IV of 1907, mentioned above), or "uselessly" aggravated
suffering within the meaning of the Declaration of St. Petersburg, 1868.
Possibly, also, their use is subject to the prohibitions contained in the Geneva
Gas and Bacteriological Warfare Protocol of 1925. In Shimoda & Ors. v.
The Japanese State (1963), Japanese Annual of International Law, 1964, 212--252,
the Tokyo District Court held that the attacks on Nagasaki and Hiroshima
were contrary to international law,

[^516/1]: As to these treaties, _see_ respectively pp. 191, 194 (1963 Treaty), pp.
196--197 (1967 Treaty), pp. 311--312 (1968 Treaty), and pp. 235--236 (1971
Treaty).

[^516/2]: The International Law Commission of the United National favoured the
discarding of this phrase; _see_ Report on work of its First Session (1949), at p. 3.
Perhaps these "laws" are more correctly termed the "rules governing the
use of armed force and the treatment of individuals in the course of war and
armed conflict". They apply to all types of armed conflicts (_see above_,
p. 491).

[^517/1]: Both the British and United States Manuals were revised after the end of
the Second World War. Part III of the British Manual, dealing with the
Law of War on Land appeared in 1958. The revised edition of the United
States Army Field Manual on the Law of Land Warfare was published in
1956.

[^517/2]: _See_ British Manual, Part III, _op. cit._, paragraphs 1 and 632.

[^518/1]: _See_ British Manual, Part III, _op. cit._, paragraph 633, and United States
Manual, _op. cit._, paragraph 3.

[^518/2]: The Geneva Conventions of 1949 prohibit reprisals against the persons
protected thereby (_see_, e.g., the prohibition of reprisals against prisoners of
war in Article 13 of the Prisoners of War Convention).

the Zone Commanders of Occupied Germany.

[^520/2]: This view is adopted by the British Manual, Part III, _op. cit._, paragraph
627. Contrast the United States Manual, _op. cit._, paragraph 509, under which
the defence of superior orders may lie if the accused did not know and could
not reasonably have been expected to know that the act ordered was unlawful.

Nuremberg in 1947--1948, War Crimes Trials Reports, Vol. 8, pp. 39--92, where
it was held that non-uniformed partisan troops operating in German-occupied
territory in the last War were not entitled to the status of lawful combatants.

[^522/1]: _See_ Mayda, _American Journal of International Law_ (1953), Vol. 47, pp. 414
_et seq._, for treatment of the problem.

[^522/2]: It is stated in the United States Manual, _op. cit._, paragraph 199 that a
Detaining Power may "in its discretion" lawfully grant asylum to prisoners
of war who do not desire to be repatriated. In the case of the India-Pakistan
conflict of 1965, Article VII of the Tashkent Declaration, January 10, 1966,
for restoring peace, provided for repatriation of prisoners.

[^523/1]: Of particular interest in both Conventions are the provisions relative to
the use of the Red Cross emblem, and concerning the protection of medical
aircraft. For a treatise on the four Conventions adopted by the Geneva
Conference of 1949, _see_ Draper The Red Cross Conventions (1958), and _see_ the
commentaries thereon of Jean S. Pictet, Director, International Committee
of the Red Cross.

[^523/2]: It is difficult to reconcile with this prohibition the general practice of using
flame-throwers and napalm bombs, as in the Second World War, and as in the
Vietnam conflict.

[^523/3]: For a comprehensive, modern treatise, _see_ Tucker The Law of War and
Neutrality at Sea (1957).

[^524/1]: At pp. 513--514,

[^525/1]: _Quaere_ whether this Protocol applies to the use of non-lethal tear gases;
the latter have been employed in the Vietnam conflict. In 1966--1970, the
application of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 came under close examination by
the United Nations General Assembly, which in 1968 requested the Secretary-General
of the United Nations to prepare a report on chemical and biological
or bacteriological weapons, and the effects of their use. A report was prepared
by a group of consultant experts, and issued by the Secretary-General on July
1, 1969. This contained a strong condemnation of such weapons, and led to
a Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on December 16, 1969,
declaring as contrary to the generally recognised rules of international law as
embodied in the 1925 Protocol, the use in international armed conflicts of :---

    (a) chemical agents of warfare with direct toxic effects on man, animals, or
    plants; and

    (b) biological agents of warfare, intended to cause death or disease
    in man, animals or plants, and dependent for their effects on ability to multiply.

    A number of important military powers, however, either voted against the
    Resolution or abstained from voting. Some States contested the right of the
    General Assembly to interpret the Protocol, claiming that this was the sole
    prerogative of the parties to that instrument.

[^525/2]: Defoliants: As to the legality of attacks on other objectives, _quaere_
whether jungle growth, plantations, and crops may be destroyed by defoliants
or other chemical agents, even if these be used to safeguard military operations
and personnel, or to prevent crops going to the enemy. From one point of
view, the indiscriminateness of the damage renders such methods of destruction
objectionable.

[^525/3]: A belligerent may also temporarily establish military government over
territory of third States, liberated from enemy occupation.

[^527/1]: Distinguish also :---

    (1) The occupation of non-enemy territory in the
    interests of military operations; e.g., the Allied occupation of North Africa,
    1942--3.

    (2) The occupation by Allies, temporarily, of the territory of another
    Allied State, which had been under military occupation by the enemy; e.g.,
    the Allied occupation of Greece in 1944.

[^527/2]: _See_ pp. 510--511.

[^527/3]: _Cf._ the reference to such persons as "protected persons". The rights of
the inhabitants under the Convention cannot be taken away by any governmental
changes, or by agreement between the local authorities and the
occupying Power, or by annexation (_see_ Article 47).

[^528/1]: Thus negativing the decision in the "Hostages Case" (U.S. v. List and
Others), p. 521, _ante_, that hostages may be executed in order to secure
obedience of the local population.

[^529/1]: _Cf._ the "Hostages Case" (U.S. v. List and Others), p. 521, _ante_.

[^529/2]: It may also be necessary to consider a tertium quid, namely the termination
of hostile or unfriendly relationships; e.g., the termination of a "confrontation",
as to which, note the agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia of
peace and co-operation, August 11, 1966, referred to, p. 497, _ante_).

[^530/1]: _See above_, pp. 168--171.

[^530/2]: _Cf._ the view adopted by Israel, and denied by Egypt that its armistice
agreement of 1949 with the four Arab States, Egypt, Lebanon, the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan, and Syria, terminated the status of war; _see_ Rosenne,
Israel's Armistice Agreement with the Arab States (1951).

[^530/3]: _See_ Re Grotrian, Cox v. Grotrian, (1955] Ch. 501, at p. 506; [1955] 1
All E.R. 788, at p. 791.

[^531/1]: _See_, e.g., Kotzias v. Tyser, [1920] 2 K.B. 69, and Ruffy-Arnell and Baumann
Aviation Co. v. R., [1922] 1 K.B. 599, at pp. 611--612.

[^531/2]: As in the case of the general Armistice of November 11, 1918, in the
First World War, which preceded the Treaty of Versailles, 1919.

[^531/3]: _See_, e.g., the references in the Preamble to the Korea Armistice Agreement
of July 27, 1953, to "stopping the Korean conflict", and to a "final peaceful
settlement"; Article 62 also refers to the eventual supersession of the Agreement
by an agreement for "a peaceful settlement at a political level".

[^532/1]: Rosenne, _op. cit._, at pp. 24--28, suggests that a truce differs from an
armistice in being a more limited method, since the armistice may involve
positive provisions other than the mere suspension of hostilities, and affect
third parties, which a truce usually does not.

[^532/2]: The termination of hostilities in Laos in 1962 was referred to as a "ceasefire"
in Article 9 of the Protocol of July 23, 1962, to the Declaration on the
Neutrality of Laos, of the same date.

[^532/3]: There was a suspension in May, 1965, in the case of the conflict in the
Dominican Republic.

[^533/1]: The terminology as to cessation of hostilities also includes a pause
(i.e., a brief period of temporary cessation of particular kinds of operations,
such as air bombardment), a "standstill" (this can cover not only a prohibition
of hostilities, i.e., cease-fire, but also a cessation of all movement of armaments
or personnel), and "de-escalation" (a diminution in the intensity, magnitude,
and range of the hostilities).

[^533/2]: Although hostilities terminated in August, 1945, the Peace Treaty with
Japan was not signed until September 8, 1951, and at the date of writing a
peace treaty with Germany has not been concluded.
