## DEVELOPMENT AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## GENERAL

Two of the most pressing problems confronting the international
community at the present time are those of development,
and of the protection and improvement of the human
environment. Needless to say, both problems have been given
priority within the framework of the United Nations. By a
Resolution of October 24, 1970, the United Nations General
Assembly proclaimed the Second Development Decade, beginning
on January 1, 1971, while by an earlier Resolution of
December 3, 1968, it decided to convene a United Nations
Conference on the Human Environment to be held at Stockholm
in 1972.

The link between these two areas in which international law
is currently feeling its way may not be immediately obvious.
It could be said, for instance, that the former topic of development
is concerned with the situation of developing countries,
whereas the degradation of the environment is a state of affairs
with which, primarily, the developed, and not the developing
countries, are afflicted. In such a statement, a number of
relevant matters are overlooked. First, any multilateral
agency responsible for the promotion of development projects,
involving large scale financial aid, must concern itself with the
ecological effects of the projects in developing countries, otherwise
ecological detriments would have to be set off against the
benefits to accrue to the developing country concerned.[^374/1]
Second, so far as development has been treated as a branch of
the general science of economics, and so far as criteria and
indicators of the quality, as distinct from the quantity of
development have been evolved, one of the accepted indicators
of development quality is the standard of environment of the
country subject of development.[^375/1] Third, it may be remembered,
as referred to in an earlier Chapter,[^375/2] that the General
Assembly has in a number of Resolutions proclaimed the
inalienable right of all countries (particularly developing
countries) to exercise permanent sovereignty over their natural
resources in the interest of their national development; in
the 1966 Resolution, such proclamation was made in the context
of a recital in the preamble that "natural resources are
limited and in many cases exhaustible and that their proper
exploitation determines the conditions of the economic development
of the developing countries both at present and in the
future". But the depletion of exhaustible natural resources
represents one of the identifiable problems involved in the
protection of the human environment. Indeed, among the
six major areas settled by the Preparatory Committee of the
Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment (_see above_)
for consideration by Conference Committees is that of "the
environmental aspects of natural resources management".
Significantly, another of these six major areas bears the title,
"development and environment".

It is for these reasons[^375/3] that the two subjects of development
and of the human environment are treated together in the
present Chapter.

## DEVELOPMENT

The international law of development has not reached the
stage yet where it can be set down as a substantial body of binding
rules, conferring specific rights upon developing States and
imposing duties on developed countries. For the most part, it
is best described as institutional law, that is to say the law of
the various bodies and agencies through which development is
promoted and development aid is channelled. At the same
time, a large number of standards and guidelines have been
defined or proclaimed, and these enter into the province of
international law no less than do the Recommendations adopted
by the International Labour Conference,[^376/1] or the Recommendations
adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Powers.[^376/2] The special
needs of development of developing countries have nevertheless
had an impact upon certain general principles of international
economic law, and have served to reduce the stringency of the
duty of non-discrimination between States, and to exclude the
international standard of treatment of resident aliens in developing
countries from the point of view of local mercantile
operations, and international trading.

The definition of "development" presents insuperable difficulties
by reason of the range of operations encompassed.
According to the Report in 1970 of the United Nations
Committee for Development, containing proposals for the
Second United Nations Development Decade[^376/3] :--- "It cannot
be over-emphasised that what development implies for
the developing countries is not simply an increase in productive
capacity but major transformations in their social and economic
structures". The Report went on to point out that "the
ultimate purpose of development is to provide opportunities
for a better life to all sections of the population",[^376/4] and to
achieve this, it would be necessary in developing countries to
eliminate inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth,
and mass poverty and social injustice, including the disparities
between regions and groups, while there would have to be
arrangements for new employment opportunities, greater
supplies of food and more nourishing food, and better education
and health facilities. On a different level, there should be
international co-operative measures to establish, strengthen,
and promote scientific research and technological activities
which have a bearing upon the expansion and modernisation
of the economies of developing countries.[^377/1] The Committee
recognised that "at the present state of knowledge, the intricate
links permeating the process of development are not all
amenable to quantification on the basis of a common framework."[^377/2]

As these general objectives have to be tailored to the requirements
of each individual developing country, the difficulty
in framing general rules of law as to development can be
appreciated.

Ten objectives, which may be regarded as standards of
development, were proposed in the Report in 1969 of the Commission
on International Development[^377/3] established by the
President of the World Bank Group, namely :---

(1) The creation
of a framework for free and equitable trade, involving the
abolition by developed countries of import duties and excessive
taxes on those primary commodities which they themselves
do not produce.

(2) The promotion of private foreign
investment, with offsetting of special risks for investors.

(3)
Increases in aid should be directed at helping the developing
countries to reach a path of self-sustained growth.

(4) The
volume of aid should be increased to a target of one per cent of
the gross national product of the donor countries.

(5) Debt
relief should be a legitimate form of aid.

(6) Procedural
obstacles should be identified and removed.

(7) The institutional
basis of technical assistance should be strengthened.

(8) Control of the growth of population.

(9) Greater resources
should be devoted to education and research.

(10) Development
aid should be increasingly multilateralised. Such
multilateralisation would contribute to a uniform development
of the principles governing the grant and receipt of aid.

On October 24, 1970, the United Nations General Assembly
adopted a policy statement under the title of the "International
Development Strategy", to be applied during the Second
Development Decade (1971--1980). This lays down _desiderata_
consistent with the above-mentioned ten objectives, including
the requirement that economically advanced countries should
endeavour to provide by 1972, if possible, one per cent of
their gross national product in aid to the developing countries.

The cornerstone of the present law of development is the
institutional structure, heterogeneous as it is, which contributes
to making possible development on an international scale.
The various principal organisations, bodies, and agencies
involved in the process include the United Nations, working
through such organs and channels as the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the related
agencies of the United Nations including the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development and its affiliates, the
Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European
Economic Community, and the Colombo Plan Committee.
In addition, an important role is played by the regional development
banks, such as the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank and the African Development
Bank. One area of the international law of development is
represented by the rules and practice that are evolving for the
co-ordination of the efforts of these different agencies.

## PROTECTION AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE HUMAN ENVIRONMENT

It is a commonplace now that a crisis of global proportions
is affecting the human environment, through pollution of the
atmosphere and of maritime, coastal, and inland waters, through
degradation of rural lands, through destruction of the ecological
balance of natural areas, through the effect of biocides upon
animal and plant life, and through the uncontrolled depletion
and ravaging of the world's natural resources, partly by reason
of the explosive growth of human populations and partly as
a result of the demands of industrial technology. The problems
involved in this environmental crisis, and the various
causes and factors which brought it about were analysed in
detail by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in a
Report on the Problems of the Human Environment, dated
May 26, 1969 (Document E/4667), prepared in relation to the
summoning of the United Nations Conference on the Human
Environment, referred to at the commencement of the present
Chapter. In a Resolution of December 15, 1969, the United
Nations General Assembly endorsed the Report, assigned to
the Secretary-General overall responsibility for organising and
preparing the Conference, and established a twenty-seven-member
Preparatory Committee to assist him.

The Report identified three basic causes as responsible for
the deterioration of the environment, namely, accelerated
population growth, increased urbanisation, and an expanded
and efficient new technology, with their associated increase in
demands for space, food, and natural resources (_see_ paragraph
8 of the Report).

As was stressed by the Secretary-General, the subject has to
date been dealt with by international law-making Conventions
in only a fragmentary manner, with room for much progress.
Illustrations of such piecemeal measures are provided by Article
IX of the Treaty of 1967 on the Principles Governing the Activities
of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space
including the Moon and Celestial Bodies, obliging States
parties to conduct space studies and exploration in such manner
as to avoid adverse changes in the environment of the earth from
the introduction of extraterrestrial matter, by the African
Convention on the Conservation of Natural Resources adopted
by the Organisation for African Unity (OAU) in 1968, by the
International Convention of 1954, as amended, for the Prevention
of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil, by the International
Plant Protection Convention of 1951, by the two Brussels
Conventions of November 29, 1969, relating to Intervention on
the High Seas in cases of Oil Pollution Casualties and on Civil
Liability for Oil Pollution Damage,[^379/1] and by a number of arrangements
designed to control pollution in particular river systems.
The Nuclear Weapons Tests Ban Treaty of 1963,[^379/2] the Treaty
of 1967 for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin
America, the Treaty of 1968 on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons,[^380/1] and the Treaty of 1971 on the Prohibition
of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons on the Seabed and
Ocean Floor and Subsoil Thereof,[^380/2] may also be regarded as
measures of environmental protection, insofar as their object
is to prevent radio-active contamination of the environmental
areas to which they relate. Also paragraph 11 of the General
Assembly's Declaration of December 17, 1970, of Principles
Governing the Seabed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil
Thereof beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction,[^380/3] affirmed
that States were to take appropriate measures for, and cooperate
in establishing a regime to govern the prevention of
pollution and contamination to the marine environment, and
of interference with the ecological balance of this environment,
and to govern also the protection and conservation of the natural
resources of the seas, and the prevention of damage to the flora
and fauna of the marine environment.

The Secretary-General's Report also detailed the various
activities of the related or specialised agencies of the United
Nations, bearing upon the human environment (_see_ Annex to
the Report). These included, for example, various standard-setting
instruments (Recommendations and Codes) of the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) for protection of
workers against pollution of the working atmospheric environment,
or against radio-active contamination (e.g., the Convention
on Protection of Workers against Ionising Radiations);
the work of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the
United Nations (FAO) in the domain of water development,
management, and conservation, of conservation and development
of plant resources, and of the scientific aspects of marine
pollution; the studies on the scientific problems of the environment
under the auspices of the United Nations Scientific,
Educational and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO),
including the Conference of 1968 convened by it on the Scientific
Basis for Rational Use and Conservation of the Resources
of the Biosphere; the work of the World Health Organisation
(WHO) in the definition of environmental standards, the
identification of environmental hazards, and the study of
induced changes in the environment; and investigations by the
International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) of the
problems of aircraft noises in the vicinity of airports, and of
sonic boom due to supersonic aircraft.

It emerges from the Secretary-General's Report that international
regulatory action is in principle appropriate for the
following :---

(a) Problem of pollution and contamination of
the oceans and atmosphere, partly because these may be the
object of general use, partly because of the impossibility in
certain cases of localising the effects of polluting or contaminating
agents.

(b) Wild species and nature reserves, upon the
basis that these are a common heritage of mankind. International
agreement may be necessary to control the export,
import, and sale of endangered species.

(c) The depletion of
marine resources, having regard to the dependence of mankind
upon the sea as a source of protein.

(d) The monitoring of
changes in the earth's atmosphere, climate, and weather conditions.

(e) The definition of international standards of
environmental quality.

(f) Reciprocal controls of, and restraints
upon certain industrial operations in all countries,
where such operations can endanger the environment, so as to
remove inducements to obtain competitive advantages by
ignoring the consequences of the processes which are a hazard
to the environment.[^381/1]

Precedents for international action in
this case are represented by International Labour Conventions,
one of the aims of which is to ensure that economic competition
between States does not thwart the realisation of proper standards
of working conditions.

As at the date of writing, substantial progress has been made
by the Preparatory Committee for the Stockholm Conference of
1972. There is already agreement, in advance of the Conference,
upon a number of measures, including the establishment of
global and regional monitoring networks for the detection of
changes in the environment brought about by human activities,
and for the surveillance of all environmental elements. What
the Conference will do is formally to confer such agreement,
and set in motion the necessary steps for the actual creation of
working arrangements.

One of the instruments to be adopted by the Stockholm
Conference will be a proposed Declaration on the Human
Environment, somewhat similar to the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights of 1948, and in like manner proclaiming
standards, principles, and goals to be accomplished by the
international community in the solution of national and international
environmental problems. The responsibility of producing
the draft text of this Declaration was in the first instance
assigned to an Inter-Governmental Working Group of the
Preparatory Committee for the Conference. The Preparatory
Committee has set up four other Inter-Governmental Working
Groups, one to be concerned with monitoring and surveillance
arrangements, as mentioned, _ante_, and the others to deal
respectively with the subjects of marine pollution, conservation,
and the degradation of soils.

In regard to marine pollution, it is hoped that the Stockholm
Conference may produce either international action on certain
aspects of damage to the marine environment, or the establishment
of useful guidelines and criteria, including recommendations
which may be of assistance to the two maritime Conferences
to be held in 1973, namely the Conference under the
auspices of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative
Organisation (IMCO) on pollution from ships, and the Conference
on the Law of the Sea.[^382/1] In this connection, it is relevant
to point out that a valuable report on the scientific basis
for international legislative control of marine pollution was
produced by the Technical Conference of the Food and Agriculture
Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), dealing with
Marine Pollution, held at Rome in December, 1970.[^382/2]
Obviously, in view of the Stockholm Conference and the two
maritime Conferences projected for 1972, this document cannot
be the last word, but it contains a number of important practical
recommendations, including the suggestion that a system of
registration should be set up on an urgent basis to cover the
dumping of all persistent or highly toxic pollutants into the sea.

The subject of conservation, as part of the general problem
of environmental protection, embraces not only the maintenance
of the integrity of areas of natural, cultural, or historical
significance, but also the safeguarding of threatened species of
animals and plants. It is expected that the Stockholm Conference
will agree to establish a World Heritage Foundation to
deal with the conservation of natural, cultural, or historical
areas, thus recognising the principle of universal zoning in the
interests of mankind in general. In regard to animals and
plants, preparatory work is to be carried out so that the Conference
may, at its option, take action upon a draft Convention
to regulate the import, export, and transit of endangered species.

So far as soil degradation is concerned, an international
Convention alone does not seem to be contemplated. The
Preparatory Committee supports the novel idea of a Plan of
Action, to be endorsed by the Conference, for enabling national
authorities to follow out national programmes of soil preservation
and reclamation. The measures part of this Plan of
Action may include a Convention, but this is not necessarily
so. A whole series of novel expedients, such as the creation of
a Special Fund, the use of national advisory bodies, and the
equipment of regional research and trading centres, will be
proposed to the Stockholm Conference.

In all this, the question of improvement of the human environment,
as distinct from its protection and preservation, is
not to be overlooked.

One of the six major areas which it has been decided to assign
to Conference Committees, bears the title, "The international
organisational implications of proposals for action". It
would seem probable that a new environmental organisation
will be set up by way of addition to the existing United Nations
family of international agencies, unless the Conference feels
that there are objectionable financial and administrative
implications in this course.
