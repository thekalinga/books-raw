## THE MATERIAL "SOURCES" OF INTERNATIONAL LAW

The material "sources"[^34/1] of international law may be defined
as the actual materials from which an international lawyer
determines the rule applicable to a given situation. These
materials fall into five principal categories or forms :---

(1) Custom

(2) Treaties.

(3) Decisions of judicial or arbitral tribunals.

(4) Juristic works.

(5) Decisions or determinations of the organs of international
institutions.

From a practical standpoint, we may imagine the legal
adviser to a particular Foreign Office called upon for an opinion
on international law in regard to some special matter. His
task is by no means as straightforward as that of a practising
lawyer concerned only with State law. He has no codes, no
statute books, and often he is in the realm of uncertainty either
because it is not clear whether a customary rule of international
law has been established or because there is neither usage
nor practice nor opinion to guide him as to the correct solution.
At all events, he must quarry for the law among these material
"sources", assisted by his own faculties of logic and reasoning,
and his sense of justice.

It will be found that the same practical approach has been
adopted by Courts which have decided questions of international
law. Under article 38 paragraph 1 of its present Statute,[^34/2] the
International Court of Justice is directed to apply the following:

(1) International treaties.[^35/1]

(2) International custom, as evidence of a general practice
accepted as law.

(3) The general principles of law recognised by civilised
nations.

(4) Judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly
qualified publicists of the various countries as subsidiary
means for the determination of rules of law.

The order of the materials in this Article is not the same as
set out above, nor does it embrace the decisions of arbitral
tribunals bearing on legal matters, or the decisions or
determinations of the organs of international institutions, while
it includes one material, "the general principles of law recognised
by civilised nations", which is not given above as a
material "source". This latter was inserted in the Court's
Statute in order to provide an additional basis for a decision in
case the other materials should give no assistance to the Court.
These "general principles" were to be applied by analogy, and
would be derived by selecting concepts recognised by all
systems of municipal law. Such was clearly the intention
originally of the draftsmen of the Statute,[^35/2] confirmed in the
context of Article 9, under which electors of the judges are to
bear in mind that the Court should be representative of "the
main forms of civilisation and of the principal legal systems of
the world", and the attempt by certain writers to give some
other interpretation to these words is both artificial and unconvincing.[^36/1]
Widely quoted or popularised maxims of law
are not of themselves "general principles", in this sense.

On several occasions the former Permanent Court of International
Justice found it necessary to apply or refer to such
"general principles". Thus in the _ChorzÃ³w Factory (Indemnity)
Case_, it applied the principle of _res judicata_ and it referred
to the "general conception of law", that "any breach of an
engagement involves an obligation to make reparation".[^36/2] In
the _Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions Case_, the Court referred
to the "general principle of subrogation",[^36/3] and in the Case
of the Diversion of Water from the Meuse, Judge Manly O.
Hudson expressed the view that the Court might apply Anglo-American
equitable doctrines as being "general principles".[^36/4]
But on at least one occasion, the Court refused to apply an
alleged "general principle"---in the _Serbian Loans Case_ where
it held that the principle in English law known as "estoppel"
was inapplicable.[^36/5] On the other hand, the private law doctrine
of trusts was considered as helpful in order to deal with certain
questions relating to the Mandates and Trusteeship systems.[^37/1]

"General principles" include procedural[^37/2] and evidentiary
principles, as well as principles of substantive law, provided
that these do possess some character of generality over and
above the context of each particular legal system to which they
belong in common. However, these "general principles"
are less a material "source" of international law than a
particular instance of judicial reason and logic which the most
authoritative international tribunal of the day is specially
enjoined to employ.[^37/3]

From the theoretical standpoint, the provision for applying
the "general principles" has been regarded as "sounding the
death-knell" of positivism, inasmuch as it explicitly rejects the
broad positivist view that custom and treaties are to be
considered the exclusive sources of international law. It has
also been said to resolve the problem of _non liquet_, i.e., the
powerlessness of an international court to decide a case legally
because of inability to find any rules of law that are applicable.[^37/4]
Finally, the provision may fairly be considered as not laying
down a new rule, but as being merely declaratory of the long-established
practice of international courts.[^37/5]

Each of the material "sources" will now be discussed in turn.

## CUSTOM

Until recent times, international law consisted for the most
part of customary rules. These rules had generally evolved
after a long historical process culminating in their recognition
by the international community. The preponderance of
customary rules was diminished as a result of the large number
of "law-making" treaties concluded since the middle of the
last century, and must progressively decline to negligible
proportions in measure as the work of the International Law
Commission in codifying and restating customary rules
produces results in treaties such as the Geneva Convention of
April 29, 1958, on the High Seas, and the Vienna Conventions
of April 18, 1961, of April 24, 1963, and of May 22, 1969,
on Diplomatic Relations, Consular Relations, and the Law of
Treaties respectively.

The terms "custom" and "usage" are often used interchangeably.
Strictly speaking, there is a clear technical
distinction between the two. Usage represents the twilight
stage of custom. Custom begins where usage ends. Usage
is an international habit of action that has not yet received
full legal attestation. Usages may be conflicting, custom must
be unified and self-consistent. Viner's Abridgement, referring
to custom in English law, has the matter in a nutshell.[^38/1]

>A custom, in the intendment of law, is such a usage as
hath obtained the force of a law

A customary element has, as we have seen, been a feature of
the rules of international law from antiquity to modern times.
In ancient Greece, the rules of war and peace sprang from the
common usages observed by the Greek City States. These
customary rules crystallised by a process of generalisation and
unification of the various usages separately observed by each
city republic. A similar process was observable among the
small Italian States of the Middle Ages. When in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries Europe became a complex of highly
nationalised, independent territorial States, the process was
translated to a higher and more extensive plane. From the
usages developed in the intercourse of modern European
States there emerged the earliest rules of international law.
Customary rules crystallise from usages or practices which
have evolved in approximately three sets of circumstances :---

(a) Diplomatic relations between States.---Thus acts or
declarations by statesmen, opinions of legal advisers to State
Governments, bilateral treaties, and now Press releases or
official statements by Government spokesmen may all constitute
evidence of usages followed by States.

(b) Practice of international organs.---The practice of international
organs may lead to the development of customary
rules of international law concerning their status, or their
powers and responsibilities. Thus in its Advisory Opinion
holding that the International Labour Organisation had power
to regulate internationally the conditions of labour of persons
employed in agriculture, the Permanent Court of International
Justice founded its views to a certain extent on the practice of
the Organisation.[^39/1] In a noted Advisory Opinion, the International
Court of Justice based its opinion that the United
Nations had international legal personality, partly on the
practice of the United Nations in concluding Conventions.[^39/2]

(c) State laws, decisions of State Courts, and State military
or administrative practices.---A concurrence, although not a
mere parallelism, of State laws or of judicial decisions of State
Courts or of State practices may indicate so wide an adoption
of similar rules as to suggest the general recognition of a broad
principle of law. This is particularly well illustrated by a
decision of the United States Supreme Court, The Scotia.[^39/3]
The facts were as follows :--- In 1863, the British Government
adopted a series of regulations for preventing collisions at sea.
In 1864, the American Congress adopted practically the same
regulations, as did within a short time after, the Governments
of nearly all the maritime countries. Under these circumstances
the Scotia (British) collided in mid-ocean with the
_Berkshire_ (American), which was not carrying the lights
required by the new regulations. As a result, the _Berkshire_
sank. The question was whether the respective rights and
duties of the two vessels were determined by the general
maritime law before the British regulations of 1863. It was
held that these rights and duties must be determined by the new
customary rules of international law that had evolved through
the widespread adoption of the British regulations, and that
therefore the fault lay with the _Berkshire_.

>This is not giving to the Statutes of any nation extraterritorial
effect. It is not treating them as general maritime
laws, but it is recognition of the historical fact that, by common
consent of mankind, these rules have been acquiesced in as
of general obligation. Of that fact we think we may take
judicial notice. Foreign municipal laws must indeed be proved
as facts, but it is not so with the law of nations.

For evidence of State practices, it may be necessary to refer to
official books or documents, such as military, naval, and Air
Force manuals, or the internal regulations of each State's diplomatic
and consular services. Comparison of these may
indicate the existence of a practice uniformly followed by all
States.

A general, although not inflexible, working guide is that
before a usage may be considered as amounting to a customary
rule of international law, two tests must be satisfied. These
tests relate to :---

(i) the material, and

(ii) the psychological
aspects involved in the formation of the customary rule.

As regards the material aspect, there must in general be a
recurrence or repetition of the acts which give birth to the
customary rule. A German Court held in the case of _LÃ¼beck
v. Mecklenburg-Schwerin_[^40/1] that a single act of a State agency
or authority could not create any rights of custom in favour
of another State which had benefited by the act; conduct to
be creative of customary law must be regular and repeated.[^40/2]
Material departures from a practice may negative the existence
of a customary rule. Apart from recurrence, the antiquity of
the acts may be also a pertinent consideration.

The psychological aspect is better known as the _opinio juris
sive necessitatis_, or as one authority[^41/1] has termed it "the mutual
conviction that the recurrence ... is the result of a compulsory
rule". This needs further explanation. Recurrence
of the usage or practice tends to develop an expectation that,
in similar future situations, the same conduct or the abstention
therefrom will be repeated. When this expectation evolves
further into a general acknowledgment by States that the conduct
or the abstention therefrom is a matter both of right and of
obligation,[^41/2] the transition from usage to custom may be
regarded as consummated. In this process, there is involved,
to some extent, an element of acceptance or assent on the part
of States generally. This conviction, this _opinio juris_, is a
convenient if not invariable test that a usage or practice has
crystallised into custom; there is, for example, an absence of
_opinio juris_ when States conform to a usage for motives of
comity or courtesy only.[^41/3] At the same time, the _opinio juris_
is not an essential element of custom, but if it is present, it is
helpful as distinguishing custom from a course of action
followed as a matter of arbitrary choice or for other reasons.[^41/4]

It would follow from the judgments of the Permanent Court
of International Justice in the _Lotus Case_s[^41/5] that the _opinio
juris_ is a matter of inference from all the circumstances, not
merely the detailed acts which constitute the material element
of the alleged customary rule. One test for the existence of
_opinio juris_ is that set out in West Rand Central Gold Mining
Co. v. R.[^42/1] There the Court laid down that it must be proved
by satisfactory evidence that the alleged rule "is of such a nature,
and has been so widely and generally accepted, that it can hardly
be supposed that any civilised State would repudiate it".
This amounts to a test of "general recognition" by the international
society of States.

Such test of "general recognition" underlies the provision[^42/2]
in the Statute of the International Court of Justice,
under which the Court is directed to apply international
custom as evidence of a general practice accepted as law",
and is to be found also in Article 53 of the Vienna Convention
of 1969 on the Law of Treaties providing that a norm of
_jus cogens_ must be one "accepted and recognised by the
international community of States as a whole".

The International Court of Justice has held, however, in the
Right of Passage over Indian Territory Case (Portugal-India),[^42/3]
that a particular practice between two States only, which is
accepted by them as law, may give rise to a binding customary
rule _inter partes_.

### Judicial Application of Custom

Both national and international Courts play an important
role in the application of custom. Often it is claimed by
one of the parties before the Court that a certain rule of
customary international law exists. The Court must then
investigate whether or not the rule invoked before it is a
validly established rule of international custom, and in the
course of this inquiry it examines all possible materials, such
as treaties, the practice of States, diplomatic correspondence,
decisions of State Courts, and juristic writings. In certain
cases, the Court's function may be more than purely declaratory;
while not actually creating new customary rules, the
Court may feel constrained to carry to a final stage the process
of evolution of usages so generally recognised as to suggest
that by an inevitable course of development they will crystallise
into custom. To use Mr. Justice Cardozo's words, by its
imprimatur the Court will attest the "jural quality" of the
custom.[^43/1]

Two instructive cases illustrating the judicial methods in
the application of custom are _The Paquete Habana_,[^43/2] a decision
of the United States Supreme Court, and the _Lotus Case_,[^43/3] a
decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice.[^43/4]
In the former case, the Supreme Court, after a detailed investigation
of the materials mentioned above, namely State laws
and practices, treaties, writings of publicists evidencing usage,
and decisions of Courts, found that they uniformly proved the
existence of a valid customary rule giving immunity to small
fishing vessels from belligerent action in time of war; in the
latter case, the Permanent Court, following the same method,
decided that there was no customary rule conferring exclusive
penal jurisdiction in maritime collision cases (on the high seas)
on the country of the ship's flag, as regards all incidents on the
ship, because, of the relevant materials considered, State laws
were not consistent, decisions of State Courts conflicted, no
uniform trend could be deduced from treaties, and publicists
were divided in their views. Although the same method of
detailed consideration of all materials was followed in both
cases, weightier proof of the customary rule was required by
the Permanent Court than by the Supreme Court, and owing to
the absence of such proof the Permanent Court decided against
the existence of the rule.

The difficulties involved in extracting a customary rule or
principle of international law from the mass of heterogeneous
documentation of State practice, State judicial decisions,
diplomatic history, etc., are not to be minimised, as the two
cases just mentioned, _The Paquete Habana_ and _The Lotus_,
amply illustrate. Not only, also, is the documentation itself
frequently defective or incomplete, but the practice of some
States is documented less adequately than that of other
States. Moreover, the experience of the International Law
Commission, and of the conferences called in 1958--1969 to
consider the Commission's drafts, revealing as it did so much
disagreement in areas where there were customary rules
assumed to be generally recognised, should induce the utmost
caution in drawing inferences as to the existence of such
general recognition.

By Article 24 of its Statute of November 21, 1947, the
International Law Commission of the United Nations was
specifically directed to "consider ways and means for making
the evidence of customary international law more readily
available",[^44/1] and the Commission subsequently reported to the
General Assembly of the United Nations on the matter.[^44/2]

## TREATIES

Treaties represent a second important material source of
international law.[^45/1] That importance is increasing.

The effect of any treaty in leading to the formation of rules
of international law depends on the nature of the treaty concerned.
In this connection there is a useful, although not
rigid, distinction between :---

(a) "law-making" treaties, which
lay down rules of universal or general application;

(b)"treaty-contracts", for example, a treaty between two or only a
few States,[^45/2] dealing with a special matter concerning these
States exclusively. This corresponds to some extent to the
distinction made by Continental jurists between Vereinbarungen
and VertrÃ¤ge.

### (a) "Law-Making" Treaties

The provisions of a "law-making" treaty are directly a
source of international law. This is not so with the "treaty-contracts",
which simply purport to lay down special obligations
between the parties only.

There has been an astonishing development of "law-making"
treaties since the middle of the nineteenth century. One
authority[^45/3] enumerated 257 such instruments concluded in the
period 1864--1914. This rapid expansion of what has been
called "international legislation" was due to the inadequacy
of custom in meeting the urgent demands of the international
society of States for the regulation of its common interests.
The urgency of these demands arose from the deep-rooted
changes which were transforming the whole structure of
international life. Industrial and economic changes were
bringing States into closer intercourse with each other, and as
international communications thus became more intimate, the
range of interests springing from the relationships between
States grew in size and complexity. In some regulation of
these complex international activities every State had a direct
interest which rose superior to considerations of national
autonomy and independence.

A rapid glance at the principal "law-making" treaties and
Conventions concluded before and after the Second World
War amply confirms this trend. These instruments deal, for
example, with Red Cross work, weights and measures, the
protection of industrial property, the protection of submarine
cables, the suppression of the slave trade, aerial navigation,
international waterways, the pacific settlement of international
disputes, international economic and monetary questions,
control of narcotics, and nationality and statelessness, all
subjects which called urgently for international statute law, and
where to rely on the growth over several years of customary
rules would have been impolitic.

A "law-making" treaty cannot in the nature of things
be one containing rules of international law always of universal
application. We are forced to admit that "law-making"
treaties may be of two kinds: (a) enunciating rules of universal
international law, e.g., the United Nations Charter; (b) laying
down general or fairly general rules.[^46/1] Then, even to the extent
that a "law-making" treaty is universal or general, it may be
really a "framework Convention", imposing duties to enact
legislation, or offering areas of choice, within the ambit of
which States are to apply the principles laid down therein; _see_,
e.g., articles 35--37 (provisions for co-operation in the penal
repression of the illicit drug traffic) of the Single Narcotic
Drugs Convention signed at New York, March 30, 1961.
Besides, some multilateral treaties are to a large extent either
confirmatory of, or represent a codification of customary
rules, as for example the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations of April 18, 1961.

The use of the term "law-making" applied to treaties has
been criticised by some writers on the ground that these treaties
do not so much lay down rules of law as set out the contractual
obligations which the States parties are to respect.
In making such a criticism these writers overlook the number
of Conventions and international legislative instruments that
are now _adopted_ by the organs of international institutions,
such as the General Assembly of the United Nations and the
Conference of the International Labour Organisation, instead
as before of being signed by the plenipotentiaries at diplomatic
Conferences. True it is that some of these Conventions and
instruments need to be ratified or accepted by States in order
to come into force, but certain of them are not even expressed
in the consensual form.

It may be that the designation "normative treaties" is the
more appropriate one. This would be capable of embracing:

(1) Treaties operating as general standard-setting instruments,
or which States apply either on a _de facto_ or on a provisional
basis; e.g., the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of
October 30, 1947, which conditions the trading relations of
so many non-party States;

(2) Unratified Conventions, significant
as agreed statements of principles to which a large
number of States have subscribed;

(3) "Closed" or "limited
participation" treaties opened for signature by a restricted
number of countries;

(4) Treaties formulating regional or
community rules;

(5) Treaties creating an internationally
recognised status or regime, operative, to some extent, _erga
omnes_; e.g., the Twelve-Power Treaty on Antarctica signed
at Washington, December 1, 1959;

(6) Instruments such as
Final Acts, to which are annexed International Regulations
intended to be applied by States parties as general rules _inter se_;
e.g., the International Regulations of 1960 for preventing
collisions at sea, formulated by the London Conference of
the same year on the Safety of Life at Sea, and being an annex
to the Conference's Final Act.

Inter-agency agreements, i.e., those between international
organisations, and in addition, even agreements between an
international organisation and a State, can also be "normative"
in the sense that they may lay down norms of general
application.

The mere fact that there are a large number of parties to a
multilateral Convention does not mean that its provisions are
of the nature of international law, binding non-parties. .
Generally speaking, non-parties must by their conduct distinctly
evidence an intention to accept such provisions as
general rules of international law. This is shown by the
decision of the International Court of Justice in 1969 in the
_North Sea Continental Shelf Cases_,[^48/1] holding on the facts that
Article 6 of the Geneva Convention of 1958 on the Continental
Shelf, laying down the equidistance rule for apportionment of
a common continental shelf, had not been subsequently accepted
by the German Federal Republic---a non-party---in the necessary
manifest manner.

### (b) Treaty-Contracts

In contrast to "law-making" treaties, treaty-contracts are
not directly a "source" of international law. They may,
however, as between the parties or signatories thereto, constitute
particular law; hence the use of the expression "particular"
Conventions in Article 38, paragraph 1, a, of the
Statute of the International Court of Justice.[^48/2] Such treaties
lead also to the formation of international law through the
operation of the principles governing the development of
customary rules.

There are three cases to be considered :---

(i) A series or a recurrence of treaties laying down a
similar rule may produce a principle of customary international
law to the same effect. Such treaties are thus a step in the
process whereby a rule of international custom emerges.
This function treaties share with, for example, diplomatic acts,
State laws, State judicial decisions, and the practice of
international organs. An illustration is the series of bilateral
extradition treaties concluded during the nineteenth century
from which such general rules as those that the nationals of
the State demanding extradition and nationals of third States
are extraditable, were deduced and became established. A
further illustration is the number of identical provisions concerning
consular privileges and immunities to be found in the
numerous recent bilateral Consular Conventions and treaties,
and which were used by the International Law Commission in
1960--1961 in drawing up its Draft Articles on Consular Relations,[^49/1]
which formed the basis of the later concluded Convention
of April 24, 1963.

(ii) It may happen with a treaty originally concluded between
a limited number of parties only that a rule in it be generalised
by subsequent independent acceptance or imitation. In this
case, the treaty represents the initial stage in the process of
recurrence of usage by which customary rules of international
law have evolved. Thus, for instance, the rule "free ships,
free goods", i.e., that enemy goods carried on a neutral vessel
are in general immune from belligerent action, first appeared
in a treaty of 1650 between Spain and the United Provinces,
and became established only at a much later period after a long
process of generalisation and recognition.[^49/2] In the _North Sea
Continental Shelf Cases_,[^49/3] the International Court of Justice
expressed the view that before a treaty provision could generate
such a process of evolution into custom, it should potentially
be of a norm-creating character so as to be capable of maturing
into a general rule of law. Apart from this, a widespread and
representative participation in a treaty rule, inclusive of the
States whose interests were specially affected, might be sufficient
to mark completion of the process.

(iii) A treaty may be of considerable evidentiary value
as to the existence of a rule which has crystallised into law
by an independent process of development. Such effect is
due to the special authority and solemnity possessed by this
type of instrument. One authority[^50/1] has pointed out that it
is "a sound maxim that a principle of international law
acquires additional force from having been solemnly acknowledged
as such in the provisions of a Public Treaty".

## DECISIONS OF JUDICIAL OR ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS

### International Judicial Decisions

The only existing permanent international judicial tribunal
with a general jurisdiction is the International Court of Justice,
which in 1946 succeeded the former Permanent Court of
International Justice, itself first created in 1921. The International
Court of Justice functions under a Statute containing
virtually the same organic regulations as the Statute of the
former Permanent Court. During the period 1921--1940, the
Permanent Court gave a large number of judgments and
advisory opinions on matters of international import, thereby
contributing, as was intended by the founders of the Court,
to the development of international jurisprudence. The work
of its successor has been of equal importance.

It would be misleading to say that any decision of the
former Permanent Court created a binding rule of international
law. Under Article 59 of its Statute (now Article 59 of the
Statute of the new International Court of Justice) the Court's
decisions were to have "no binding force except between the
parties and in respect of that particular case". Pursuant to
its Statute, the Permanent Court did not treat its own prior
decisions as _per se_ binding, and such decisions could therefore
hardly be regarded by the international society of States as
binding legal precedents. The Court, however, did use its
prior decisions for guidance as to the law, for example, for
purposes of illustrating or distinguishing the application of
particular rules; also, it had regard to the principles of international
law and to the reasoning on which previous decisions
were based, since the expression "decision" in Article 59
connoted only the operative portion of the Court's judgment,
as distinct from the grounds given for such judgment; and
as a general practice it followed a line or series of its prior
decisions and opinions which were consistently of a similar
trend, although it did not at any time purport to bind itself by
any expressed doctrine of judicial precedent. The present
International Court of Justice has in its turn followed a
practice consistent with that of its predecessor.[^51/1] Moreover,
the International Court has shown that it regards itself as free
to "develop" international law, without being tied by the
weight of prior practice and authority, as witness its judgment
in 1951 in the Fisheries Case (United Kingdom-Norway)[^51/2]
upholding the legitimacy of the baselines method for delimiting
the territorial sea in certain coastal waters. Clearly, to the
extent that a decision by the Court, or a particular principle
laid down by it becomes accepted by States generally, as
occurred with this baselines method (_see now_ Article 4 of the
Geneva Convention of April 28, 1958, on the Territorial Sea
and Contiguous Zone), the Court would be justified in regarding
itself as bound by its former pronouncements.

Quite apart from the attitude of both Courts towards their
own prior decisions, the judgments and advisory opinions
delivered by them are considered by international lawyers
generally as elucidating the law, as being the expression of
what the most authoritative international judicial body holds
to be the international law on a given point, having regard to
a given set of circumstances.

An example of a temporary---as distinct from a permanent---
international judicial body contributing substantially towards
the development of international law is that of the judgment
of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1946
which laid down important principles relating to crimes against
the peace and security of mankind.[^51/3]

### State Judicial Decisions

There are two ways in which the decisions of State Courts
may lead to the formation of rules of international law :---

(a) The decisions may be treated as weighty precedents, or
even as binding authorities. According to Marshall, C.J., of
the United States Supreme Court[^52/1] :---

>The decisions of the Courts of every country show how
the law of nations, in the given case, is understood in that
country, and will be considered in adopting the rule which is
to prevail in this.

A notable example is furnished by the decisions of the great
British Prize Court Judge---Lord Stowell, who presided over
the Court during the Napoleonic Wars. Lord Stowell's
judgments received universal acknowledgment as authoritative
declarations of the law, and he became peculiarly identified
with the establishment of important doctrines, such as: that
blockade to be binding must be effective, that contraband of
war is to be determined by probable destination, and the
doctrine of continuous voyage. Similarly, both as exponent
and as agent for the development of international law, the
Supreme Court of the United States has played an important
role; for example, its judgments in _The Paquete Habana_[^52/2] and the
Scotia[^52/3] did much to clarify the nature of international custom.

(b) The decisions of State Courts may, under the same
principles as dictate the formation of custom, lead directly to
the growth of customary rules of international law. Thus,
for example, certain rules of extradition law and of State
recognition were in the first instance derived from the uniform
decisions of State Courts. A concurrence of such decisions
is usually necessary for this purpose, for if there be no uniformity,
a customary rule of international law will not be
inferred. Thus, in the _Lotus Case_ (_ante_, p. 43), the Permanent
Court of International Justice refused to deduce a customary
rule where, to use the Court's expression, State judicial decisions
on the point were "divided".

### Decisions of International Arbitral Tribunals

Decisions of international arbitral tribunals such as the
Permanent Court of Arbitration, the British-American Mixed
Claims Tribunal, and others, have contributed to the development
of international law. In the following branches, arbitral
decision has either added to or clarified the law :---Territorial
sovereignty, neutrality, State jurisdiction, State servitudes, and
State responsibility. Many notable arbitrations, for example,
the _Alabama Claims Arbitration_ (1872), the _Behring Sea Fisheries
Arbitration_ (1893), the Pious Fund Case (1902), and the _North
Atlantic Fisheries Case_ (1910) are regarded as landmarks in
the history of international law.

Some writers have refused to acknowledge this contribution
on the ground of an alleged fundamental distinction between
arbitral and judicial decision. According to these writers,
arbitrators have as a general practice tended to act as negotiators
or diplomatic agents rather than as judges on questions of
fact and law. They insist that arbitrators have been influenced
to an unreasonable extent by the necessity of reaching a
compromise. There is naturally an element of truth in this
conception of arbitral decision, and arbitrators are less strictly
bound by necessary technicalities than judges working within
the ambit of established rules of procedure, but the distinction
from judicial decision is by no means so fundamental as pictured.
In the great majority of cases arbitrators have regarded themselves
as acting to some extent judicially, rather than as
_amiables compositeurs_. Moreover, if arbitral awards were
merely quasi-diplomatic compromises, it would be difficult
to explain how notable awards like The Alabama Claims, the
Behring Sea Fisheries, and so on, have contributed to the growth
of international law.

The "compromise" element in arbitral adjudications has
been unduly exaggerated because under so many treaties
arbitrators were authorised to act "ex Ã¦quo et bono", but
even in such cases arbitrators commonly acted according to
judicial principles. By far the greater majority of arbitral
awards have been based on strictly legal considerations in
form and substance. Judge J. B. Moore, with unrivalled
knowledge of arbitral adjudications, declared[^54/1] :---

>I have failed to discover support for the supposition that
international arbitrators have shown a special tendency to
compromise, or that they have failed to apply legal principles
or to give weight to legal precedents. Indeed, even in the
abridged form in which many of the decisions cited in my
History and Digest of International Arbitrations, published in
1898, were necessarily given in that work, nothing, is more
striking than the consistent effort to ascertain and apply
principles of law approved by the best authorities, and to
follow pertinent prior adjudications where any existed.

The main distinction between arbitration and judicial
decision lies not in the principles which they respectively apply,
but in the manner of selection of the judges, their security of
tenure, their independence of the parties, and the fact that the
judicial tribunal is governed by a fixed body of rules of procedure
instead of by _ad hoc_ rules for each case.

## JURISTIC WORKS

It is perhaps needless to insist on the important role played
by jurists in the development of international law.

Juristic works are not an independent "source" of law,
although sometimes juristic opinion does lead to the formation
of international law. According to the report of one expert
body to the League of Nations,[^54/2] juristic opinion is only
important as a means of throwing light on the rules of international
law and rendering their formation easier. It is of
no authority in itself, although it may become so if subsequently
embodied in customary rules of international law; this is due
to the action of States or other agencies for the formation of
custom, and not to any force which juristic opinion possesses.

Article 38 of the Statute of the Internationai Court of
Justice directs the Court to apply "the teachings of the most
highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as _subsidiary_
means for the determination of rules of law". This provision
emphasises the evidentiary value of juristic works. No doubt
the principal function of juristic works is to furnish reliable
evidence of the law. Jurists have been largely responsible for
deducing customary rules from a coincidence or cumulation of
similar usages or practices, and to this extent, they perform an
indispensable service. The evidentiary function of juristic
works has been well described by Gray, J.,[^55/1] of the United
States Supreme Court :---

>Where there is no treaty, and no controlling executive
or legislative act or judicial decision, resort must be had to
the customs and usages of civilised nations, and as evidence
of these, to the works of jurists and commentators who by
years of labour, research, and experience have made themselves
peculiarly well acquainted with the subjects of which they treat.
Such works are resorted to by judicial tribunals, not for the
speculations of their authors concerning what the law ought to
be, but for trustworthy evidence of what the law really is.

Although there are several authorities which deny that the
opinions or speculations of jurists whether a certain rule
ought to be recognised are of any force,[^55/2] it is an undoubted
fact that juristic opinion may be evidence not merely of established
customary rules, but of customary rules which are
bound in course of time to become established. The reaction of
juristic opinion may be of great importance in assisting the
transition from usage to custom.

In view of this evidentiary function, the passage of time will
add weight to the authority of juristic opinion, particularly if
generally relied upon, or if no principles contrary to such
opinion become established.[^55/3] To this extent, juristic works
may acquire a kind of prescriptive authority. However, the
labours of the International Law Commission since its inception
have shown how cautious one must be in accepting as conclusive
evidence of a generally recognised customary rule, even
an established _consensus omnium_ among jurists.

In one exceptional case, juristic opinion does assume importance.
Where there are no established customary or treaty
rules in regard to a particular matter, recourse may be had to
juristic opinion as an independent "source", in addition to
the views expressed in decided cases or in diplomatic exchanges.
Thus in the Privy Council case of _Re Piracy Jure Gentium_[^56/1], the
question arose whether actual robbery was an essential element
in the crime of piracy at international law.[^56/2] On this point,
the Privy Council found itself mainly dependent on juristic
opinion, and ruled that it could not only seek a _consensus_ of
views, but select what appeared to be the better views. It
finally decided that robbery was not an essential element in
piracy _jure gentium_, and that a frustrated attempt to commit
piratical robbery was equally piracy _jure gentium_.

## DECISIONS OR DETERMINATIONS OF THE ORGANS OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

Decisions or determinations of the organs of international
institutions may lead to the formation of rules of international
law in a number of different ways :---

(1) They may represent intermediate or final steps in the
evolution of customary rules, particularly those governing the
constitutional functioning of these institutions. The decisive
criterion is the extent to which the decision, determination or
recommendation has been adhered to in practice;[^56/3] of itself
it is not of normative effect. Thus from the practice of the
United Nations Security Council (_cf._ similarly the League of
Nations Council), there has developed the rule that an abstention
by a Member State from voting is not to be deemed a
non-concurring vote for the purpose of determining whether a
decision on a non-procedural question has been validly taken
by the Security Council according to the voting requirements
of Article 27 of the United Nations Charter.[^57/1] As regards
international law in general, the Resolutions since 1952 of the
United Nations General Assembly have gone far towards confirming
a rule that dependent peoples are entitled to self-determination.[^57/2]


(2) A Resolution of the organ of an international institution
which validly formulates principles or regulations for the internal
working of the institution may have full legal effect as laying
down rules which are binding on the members and organs of
the institution.

(3) Inasmuch as an organ of an international institution has
inherent power, in doubtful cases not precisely covered by its
Constitution, to determine the limits of its own competence,
such decisions by it on questions of its jurisdiction may have a
law-making effect.

(4) Sometimes, organs of international institutions are
authorised to give binding determinations concerning the interpretation
of their constituent instruments (for example, the
Executive Directors and the Board of Governors of the International
Monetary Fund have such power under Article XVIII
of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, of July 22, 1944).[^57/3]
These interpretative decisions will form part of the law of the
international institution in question.

(5) Some organs of international institutions are empowered
to give general decisions of quasi-legislative effect, binding on
all the members to whom they are addressed; for example, as
are the Council and Commission of the European Economic
Community (Common Market) under Article 189 of the Treaty
of Rome of March 25, 1957, establishing the Community.

(6) A special case is that of the determinations or opinions of
Committees of Jurists, specifically instructed by the organ of an
international institution to investigate a legal problem.[^58/1] These
necessarily bear some weight and authority.

Reference should also be made to the discussion in Chapter
19, below, of the legislative and regulatory powers of international
institutions.[^58/2]

### Order of Use of Material "Sources"

The final question is in what order should these material
"sources"---custom, treaties, arbitral and judicial decisions
bearing on legal matters, juristic works, and decisions or
determinations of the organs of international institutions---
be used for ascertaining the law on a given matter. It will be
remembered that the order in which the material "sources"
were set out in paragraph 1 of Article 38 of the Statute of the
International Court of Justice was :---

(1) Treaties and Conventions.

(2) Custom.

(3) "General principles of law recognised by civilised
nations".

(4) Judicial decisions and juristic opinion, "as subsidiary
means for the determination of rules of law".

This order is generally followed in practice. Treaties and
Conventions, custom, and general principles of law recognised
by civilised nations are deemed to prevail over judicial decisions
and juristic opinion, which are expressly declared by paragraph
1 of Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of
Justice to be "subsidiary means for the determination of rules
of law". So far as the first three categories are concerned,
priority would normally be attributed to treaties and Conventions
expressly recognised by the States concerned; if
there were no treaties or Conventions applicable, preference
would be accorded to established customary rules, while if there
were no such rules, recourse could be had to general principles
of law recognised by civilised nations. If none of these three
categories furnished clear rules applicable to the matter, judicial
and arbitral decisions, and juristic opinion could be resorted
to, with more weight being given usually to decisions of Courts
than to expressions of opinion by jurists and text-book writers.
The weight to be given to a decision or determination of an
international institution would depend upon its nature and
content, and upon the provisions of the constituent instrument
of the organisation. There may also be duplication of applicability,
as for example when a Convention contains a provision
declaratory of customary international law, or when a general
principle of law recognised by civilised nations is at the same
time confirmatory of a treaty or customary rule.

It is to be observed that the enumeration in paragraph 1 of
Article 38 of the Court's Statute makes no reference to such
principles as those of equity and justice, or to the processes of
legal reasoning to which a judge or practising lawyer is always
entitled to have recourse. When such principles or processes
are availed of, it may indeed be found that one category of
material "sources", for example a Convention, has actually
no application to the particular matter concerned, which is
governed by some category of a lower order, for example a
rule of custom.

### Peremptory Principles or Norms of International Law; _jus cogens_

Lastly, mention should be made of the concept of _jus cogens_,[^59/1]
that is to say the body of peremptory principles or norms from
which no derogation is permitted, and which may therefore
operate to invalidate a treaty or agreement between States to
the extent of the inconsistency with any of such principles or
norms.[^59/2] According to Article 53 of the Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties of May 22, 1969, it is an additional
characteristic of a norm of _jus cogens_ that it "can be modified
only by a subsequent norm or general international law having
the same character", although in this article _jus cogens_ is
defined merely "for the purposes" of the Convention. There
is undoubtedly some analogy between _jus cogens_ and the
principles of public policy which at common law render a
contract void if it offends against these, such as the principle
that parties cannot by agreement between themselves oust the
ordinary courts from their jurisdiction.[^60/1] Assuming that this
analogy holds good, one must correspondingly bear in mind
some of the metaphors used by harassed common law judges
to describe the doctrine of public policy, such as "a very unruly
horse", "treacherous ground", and "slippery ground".[^60/2]
Critics of the concept of _jus cogens_ in international law have
also urged that it may be resorted to as a means of avoiding
onerous treaty obligations, or even to justify interference in
matters otherwise falling within the domestic jurisdiction of
States.

One major difficulty is related to the identification of norms
of _jus cogens_. First, should this function of identification be
performed solely by multilateral law-making Conventions,
or may a norm of _jus cogens_ evolve through the same
process as in the case of customary rules of international
law? Article 64 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties provides that "if a new peremptory norm of general
international law emerges, any existing treaty which is in conflict
with that norm becomes void and terminates". The word
emerges shows that it was contemplated that a norm of
_jus cogens_ could be one of customary international law. Second,
there is a lack of _consensus_ as to what, at the present time, are
norms of _jus cogens_. Two such generally acceptable norms
seem to be the prohibition against the threat or use of force in
the terms laid down in Article 2 paragraph 4 of the United

[^60/1]: _See_ Lee v. Showmen's Guild of Great Britain, (1952] 2 Q.B. 329, at p. 342.

[^60/2]: For the various metaphors used, _see_ Newcastle Diocese Trustees v. Ebbeck
(1961), A.L.R. 339, at pp. 350--351.


Nations Charter, and the principle of _pacta sunt servanda_, as
defined in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties. Other suggested norms, for example the principle
of sovereign equality of States, and the principle of peaceful
settlement of disputes, while acceptable as propositions of law,
have not found general favour as being of the nature of _jus
cogens_.

A general provision as to _jus cogens_ is contained in Article
53 (mentioned above) of the Vienna Convention on the Law
of Treaties;[^61/1] this reads :---

>A treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts
with a peremptory norm of general international law. For
the purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory norm of
general international law is a norm accepted and recognised
by the international community of States as a whole as a norm
from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified
only by a subsequent norm of general international law
having the same character.

The article reflects the underlying notion in _jus cogens_ that its
component norms are conditioned by the interests of the international
community as whole. The drafting of the first
sentence is open to objection. If it means that the whole of a
treaty is void when a single provision offends against _jus cogens_,
this is an untenable proposition, for in many cases the provision
may be severable. The sentence would be more acceptable if
the word "provision" were added after the word "treaty".
It remains to say that the concept of _jus cogens_, if applicable
to treaties, must also render inoperative usages or practices
conflicting with peremptory norms.

[^61/1]: As to its drafting history at the Vienna Conference, _see_ R. D. Kearney and
R. E. Dalton, _American Journal of International Law_, Vol. 64 (1970), at pp. 535--538.



[^34/1]: The term "sources" has been placed in inverted commas in order to
mark the fact that, although frequently used as above, it is liable to misconstruction.


[^34/2]: This provision is similar to the corresponding provision in Article 38 of the
Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, except that it is
expressly said in the new provision that the Court's function is to decide in
accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it".


[^35/1]: These are described as "international Conventions, whether general or
particular, establishing rules expressly recognised by the contesting States".

[^35/2]: In the Advisory Committee of Jurists which in 1920 drafted the corresponding
article of the Statute of the Court's predecessor, the Permanent Court
of International Justice, Lord Phillimore pointed out that the general
principles referred to were those accepted by all nations in the municipal
sphere, such as certain principles of procedure, the principle of good faith,
and the principle of _res judicata_; Proceedings of the Committee, p. 335.
In the _Case Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co., Ltd.
(Second Phase)_, I.C.J. Reports, 1970, p. 3, the International Court of Justice
had regard to the general rule under municipal legal systems (_see_ paragraph
50 of the Court's judgment) which indicated that an infringement of a company's
rights by outsiders did not involve liability towards the shareholders
individually; from this the Court reached the conclusion that the national
State of the shareholders was not normally entitled to espouse the claim of the
shareholders for loss suffered through an international wrong done to the
company itself.


[^36/1]: Among the various interpretations given to the words "general principles
of law recognised by civilised nations" there have been the following :---

    (a) General principles of justice.
    
    (b) Natural law.
    
    (c) Analogies derived from private law.
    
    (d) General principles of comparative law.
    
    (e) General principles of international law (the view adopted by certain Soviet writers).
    
    (f) General theories of law.
    
    (g) General legal concepts. _See also_ Rousseau, _Principes GÃ©nÃ©raux du Droit International Public_ (1944), Vol. 1, pp. 889 _et seq._
    
    According to Professor G. I. Tunkin the "general principles" are to be derived
    only from two sources, treaty and custom; _see_ his _Droit International Public:
    ProblÃ¨mes ThÃ©oriques_ (Paris, 1965, tr. from Russian), p. 127.

[^36/5]: Pub. P.C.I.J. (1929), Series A, Nos. 20--21, pp. 38--9. Yet the International
Court of Justice applied the principle of estoppel or preclusion in the _Case
concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear_, I.C.J. Reports, 1962, 6, and also dealt
with that principle in the _Barcelona Traction Case, Preliminary Objections_,
I.C.J. Reports, 1964, 6, where however the principle was held not to debar
Belgium from proceeding. Note also the references to estoppel :---

    (a) in the  _North Sea Continental Shelf Cases_, I.C.J: Reports, 1969, 3, at p. 26, in respect
    to the question whether a non-party had accepted a treaty provision; and
    
    (b) in the _Argentina-Chile Boundary Arbitration Award_ (H.M.S.O., 1966), pp. 66--
    68, as to alleged estoppels by reason of representations regarding the course of
    boundary lines.

[^37/2]: In the _South West Africa Cases, 2nd Phase_, I.C.J. Reports, 1966, 6 at
pp. 39, 47, the International Court of Justice applied the "universal and
necessary" principle of procedural law that there was a distinction between:

    (a) a plaintiff's legal right appertaining to the subject matter of his claim;
    and
    
    (b) his right to activate a Court and the Court's right to examine the
    merits; and at the same time, it refused to allow anything like an _actio popularis_,
    i.e., a right in a member of a community to vindicate a point of public
    interest, albeit such _actio_ was known to certain domestic legal systems.

[^37/4]: Article 11 of the model Draft Articles on Arbitral Procedure drawn up by
the International Law Commission of the United Nations in 1958 provides
that an arbitral tribunal is not to bring in a finding of _non liquet_ "on the
ground of the silence or obscurity of the law to be applied".

[^40/2]: There are none the less certain instances of a single act creating a custom;
e.g., in the practice of international organisations, when a Resolution or
decision may suffice to create a precedent for future action. In the Asylum
Case, I.C.J. Reports (1950) at 276--277, the International Court of Justice
stressed the necessity for constancy and uniformity of usages or practices,
before they can be recognised as custom. _See also_ Kunz in _American Journal

they were conforming to what amounted to a legal obligation; habitual
action in itself was not enough.

[^43/4]: These two cases should, however, be used with caution, as the customary
rule found to exist according to _The Paquete Habana_, viz., the immunity of
small fishing vessels from belligerent action in time of war is, _semble_, now
obsolete, while the alleged customary rule of exclusive penal jurisdiction of
the flag State in maritime collision cases (on the high seas) negatived in the
_Lotus Case_, was adopted by the Geneva Conference of 1958 on the Law of the
Sea, and formulated as Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Convention on the High
Seas of April 29, 1958 (subject to the concurrent jurisdiction of the State of
nationality over the persons responsible for the collision, etc). A more
recent illustration of judicial investigation of the problem whether a practice of
States conclusively reflects tence of a customary rule of international
law is the _North Sea Continental Shelf Cases_, I.C.J. Reports, 1969, 3, where the
International Court of Justice ruled against the existence of a customary rule
that the division of a common continental shelf of adjacent countries must be
effected according to the equidistance principle.

[^44/2]: Among the Commission's recommendations was one that the General
Assembly should call the attention of Governments to the desirability of their
publishing Digests of their diplomatic correspondence. The matter has also
occupied the General Assembly at its sessions in 1950 and subsequent years,
For the Commission's recommendations, _see_ Report on the work of its second
session (1950).


[^45/1]: There is a fairly consistent trend in Soviet Russian theoretical writings
on international law to regard treaties as the primary or fundamental source
of international law; _see_ article by Triska and Slusser in _American Journal of
International Law_ (1958) Vol. 52, pp. 699--726, same Journal, Vol. 51 (1957),
at pp. 135--136, and Professor G. I. Tunkin's _Droit International Public:
ProblÃ¨mes ThÃ©oriques_ (Paris, 1965, tr. from Russian), p. 92 (_see_ _ibid_., pp. 63--75
as to the extent to which treaties play a role in the formation of international
law).

[^45/2]: In certain cases, a bilateral treaty may have a "law-making" effect;
e.g., the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty of 1901 between the United States and Greai
Britain, providing that the Panama Canal should be free and open to the
vessels of all nations on terms of entire equality.

[^58/1]: _See_, e.g. the opinion of the Committee of Jurists appointed in 1920 by the
League of Nations Council to advise on the question of the Aaland Islands.
The Committee's view that a Convention of 1856, whereby Russia agreed not

on interested adjoining States although not parties to the Convention, has
been cited with express or implied approval in leading text-books.

in International Law (1967).

[^59/2]: It may be, of course, that the treaty as a whole must be treated as void,
because of the inseverability of its content, or because the treaty's operation is
dependent upon a condition precedent which offends against a norm of _jus
cogens_.
