## SUCCESSION TO RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

## SUCCESSION IN GENERAL

The subject discussed in the present Chapter is more frequently
treated in the text-books under the titles of "State Succession"[^320/1]
and "Succession of Governments", although this terminology
is somewhat inappropriate.[^320/2]

In the former case of so-called "State Succession" we are
principally concerned with the transmission of rights or
obligations from States which have altered or lost their identity
to other States or entities, such alteration or loss of identity
occurring primarily when complete or partial changes of
sovereignty take place over portions of territory. The questions
of international law involved may be summarised as :---

(1) To what extent are the existing rights and obligations of
the predecessor State extinguished, or---where there is a change
of sovereignty over portion only of the territory of that State---
to what extent do they remain vested in that State ?

(2) To what extent does the successor State, i.e., the State to
which sovereignty has passed wholly or partially, become
entitled to such rights or subject to such obligations?

In this connection the term "State Succession" is a misnomer,
as it presupposes that the analogies of private law,
where on death or bankruptcy, etc., rights and obligations
pass from extinct or incapable persons to other individuals, are
applicable as between States. The truth, however, is that there
is no general principle in international law of succession as
between States, no complete juridical substitution of one State
for the old State which has lost or altered its identity. What
is involved is primarily a change of sovereignty over territory,
through concurrent acquisition and loss of sovereignty, loss to
the States formerly enjoying sovereignty, and acquisition by
the States to which it has passed wholly or partially. It is
not feasible to carry over to international law analogies concerned
with the transmission of a _universitas juris_ under
domestic law. So far as rights and duties under international
law are concerned, no question whatever of succession to these
is involved. The State which has taken over is directly subject
to international law, simply by virtue of being a State, not by
reason of any doctrine of succession.

In the second case of the so-called "Succession of Governments",
a different problem is involved. The change of
sovereignty is purely internal, whether it takes place through
constitutional or revolutionary processes. A new Government
takes up the reins of office, and the question is to what extent
are the rights and obligations of the former Government
extinguished, and to what extent does the new Government
become entitled to such rights or bound by such obligations.

In more correct terminology, the two cases therefore resolve
themselves into :---

(a) The passing of rights and obligations
upon external changes of sovereignty over territory.[^321/1]

(b) The
passing of rights and obligations upon internal changes of
sovereignty, irrespective of territorial changes. Each of these
cases will be discussed in turn.

## PASSING OF RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UPON EXTERNAL CHANGES OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER TERRITORY

The most common situations in which external changes of
sovereignty over territory take place are these :---

(i) Part of the
territory of State A becomes incorporated in that of State B,
or is divided between several States, B, C, D, and others.

(ii) Part of the territory of State A is formed as the basis of a
new State.

(iii) The whole of the territory of State A becomes
incorporated in that of State B, State A in effect becoming
extinguished.

(iv) The whole of the territory of State A
becomes divided between several States, B, C, D, and others,
again involving the extinction of State A.

(v) The whole of
the territory of State A forms the basis of several new States,
State A again becoming extinguished.

(vi) The whole of the
territory of State A becomes part of the territory of a single
new State, again involving the extinction of State A.

These cases of external changes of sovereignty by no means
exhaust the multifarious situations which may arise. Changes
of sovereignty over territory may take place not only from
States to States, but also from States to non-State entities, for
example, international institutions;[^322/1] and non-State entities, for
example, trust territories and Protectorates, may themselves
acquire sovereignty on attaining Statehood. Besides, the
diversity of situations and factors involved must not be overlooked.
There may be variations in the mode of the change
of sovereignty, which may be by annexation, adjudication by
international Conference, voluntary cession, or revolution.
Much may depend also on the size of the territory concerned,
the number of inhabitants affected, and the social and economic
interests involved, which inevitably play a role in these days of
modern States with their complex structure. Finally, the
nature of the particular rights and obligations, which are
alleged to pass, must be considered.

For all these reasons, it is difficult to present the subject as
a body of coherent principles. No facile criteria can be offered
as a guide.[^323/1] As Professor H. A. Smith said[^323/2] :---

>... The complexity and variety of the problems which
arise in practice are such as to preclude accurate and complete
analysis within narrow limits.

None the less, a consideration of the practice, and of judicial
authority and doctrine,[^323/3] suggests a tendency to pay regard to
the question whether it is just, reasonable, equitable, or in the
interests of the international community that rights or obligations
should pass upon external changes of sovereignty over
territory. It is significant that criteria of justice and reasonableness
seem to have been applied in recent succession practice,
for example, in the arrangements of 1947--8 between Pakistan
and India on the occasion of the division of the Indian Empire
and their emergence as two new States.[^323/4] Moreover, treaties
providing expressis verbis for the transfer of certain obligations
upon changes of sovereignty have generally been interpreted
by international tribunals in the light of considerations of
reason and justice.[^323/5]

Yet State practice on the subject is unsettled and full of
inconsistencies. Possibly, owing to the uncertainty of the
international law of succession, the modern tendency is to deal
expressly with all possible cases under a treaty between the
parties affected (the so-called "voluntary succession").[^324/1]

It is, however, a sound general working rule, and one applied
in the case-law, to look at the texts of any relevant laws,
treaties, declarations, and other arrangements accompanying
the change of sovereignty, and ascertain what was the intention
of the State or States concerned as to the continuance or
passing of any rights or obligations.

The nature of the subject requires that each of the categories
of rights and obligations be dealt with in turn.

#### (1) Succession to Treaty Rights and Obligations

There is no general rule that all treaty rights and obligations
pass, nor any generally accepted principle favouring the greatest
possible continuity of treaty relations.

Where a State becomes extinguished by the loss of all its
territory, _prima facie_ no rights and obligations of an executory[^324/2]
character under treaties pass to the successor State, with the
exception of :---

(a) Such treaties as pertain directly to the
territory that has changed masters, for example, treaties creating
a servitude[^324/3] or quasi-servitude such as a right of passage, or
treaties neutralising or demilitarising the territory concerned.

(6) Multilateral Conventions relative to health, narcotics, and
similar matters, which are intended to apply, notwithstanding
such changes, in respect of the territory. This _prima facie_ rule
may have to give way to controlling facts or circumstances
rendering it reasonable or equitable that certain treaty rights
and obligations should pass; for example, if the particular
treaty were one under which the consideration had been
executed in favour of the extinct State, and the successor State
had taken the benefit of that consideration, the latter would
become liable to perform the corresponding obligations.[^325/1]
_Semble_, also, if the successor State represents merely an enlargement
of the predecessor State (as in the case of the incorporation
of Prussia into the German Empire), prior treaty rights
and obligations would pass in principle.

Where the predecessor State does not become extinguished,
for instance, where part only of its territory is lost to it, _prima
facie_ the passing of treaty rights and obligations depends on
the nature of the treaty. Rights or obligations under political
treaties, for example, of alliance, are as a rule deemed not to
pass, and this on the whole seems reasonable, particularly
where the treaty presupposes that the predecessor State shall
be the only entity with which the other States parties were
prepared to enter into a political arrangement. There is,
however, an absence of agreement as to what constitutes a
political treaty. Rights or obligations under multilateral
Conventions intended to be of universal application on health,
technical, and similar matters may pass,[^325/2] except those Conventions
which are the constituent instruments of international
organisations, and which require the admission of the successor
State by decision of an international organ before it can become
a party,[^325/3] or Conventions which by their express or implied
terms preclude the successor State from becoming a party to the
Convention, or from becoming a party except with the consent
of all existing parties. Treaties creating servitudes or quasi-servitudes,
or obligations pertaining to, or for the benefit of
the territory subject of the change of sovereignty or adjoining
territory, may also pass.[^326/1] Treaties outside these categories,
such as of commerce, and extradition, do not pass unless
some strong consideration requires this. In the case of
a treaty of extradition, it would generally be unreasonable to
bind the successor State under it, because normally such a treaty
relates to special offences and procedure under the municipal
criminal law of the predecessor State, and a different penal
code may be in force in the case of the successor State.[^326/2]

The extensive decolonisation or emancipation of dependent
and trust territories, 1956--1970, produced a welter of practice
concerning the extent to which :---

(a) treaties formerly applying
to them, e.g., under "territories clauses" of Conventions,
continued to apply to them in their new international capacity;

(b) treaty rights and obligations generally of the parent or
tutelary State passed to them.

It is a bewilderingly hopeless
exercise to seek to spell out from this practice any new general
customary principles of international law; one circumstance
alone would be sufficient to negate the value and significance
of any such effort, namely the number and nature of the different
expedients adopted by newly emerged States to deal with the
question of what treaties they would either recognise or refuse
to acknowledge as applicable to them; among such expedients
were "devolution agreements" and "inheritance agreements"
with the parent or tutelary State,[^326/3] or unilateral declarations,[^326/4]
including the so-called "temporising declaration" whereby
the newly emerged State agreed to accept, wholly or partially,
upon a basis of reciprocity, the former treaty régime pending
a treaty-by-treaty review, and a final decision based upon such
investigation.[^327/1] Some newly emerged States preferred indeed
to give general notice that they were beginning with a "clean
slate", so far as their future treaty relations were concerned.

This very diversity of action, apart from other considerations,
appears inconsistent with the proposition that the practice has
given rise to rules of general law as to succession _stricto sensu_.
Moreover, when it is claimed, for example, that a devolution
agreement may, with regard to a particular treaty, operate by
way of novation between the parent State, the new State, and
the other State party, or that a unilateral declaration may have
effect upon the basis of estoppel or preclusion so as to bind the
new State, these are not illustrations of the application of
principles of succession, but rather of the incidence of the law
of treaties or of the rules as to estoppel. Not to be overlooked
also is the practical problem in many cases of determining, in
the light of the law of treaties and of general principles of
international law, whether a former treaty is inherently or by
its terms invokable against the new State; in this connection,
the provisions of the devolution agreement or unilateral declaration
may be legally irrelevant.[^327/2]

#### (2) Succession to Non-Fiscal Contractual Rights and Obligations

The extent to which these pass is highly debatable. The
following principles may perhaps be formulated :---

(a) A contractual right which is solely of the nature of a
claim to unliquidated damages, and which cannot be alternatively
enforced as a quasi-contractual right against the
predecessor or successor State (for example, by reason of some
benefit taken over by such State) does not survive the change
of sovereignty. But if some element of quasi-contract is
involved, for example, unjustified enrichment to the predecessor
or successor State, the right and corresponding obligation
may survive.[^328/1]

(b) A contractual right which is of the nature of a vested or
acquired right ought to be respected by the successor State. To
be such a vested or acquired right, it must be liquidated in
nature and correspond to some undertaking, or enterprise, or
investment of a more or less established character;[^328/2] or---in
more general terms---the right must be such that it would be
unjust for the successor State not to give effect to it. Hence a
merely executory contractual right, without more, is not a
vested or acquired right. This concept of vested or acquired
rights has been accepted by municipal and international
tribunals,[^328/3] although in view of the element of appreciation
involved, there still remains some uncertainty regarding its
scope, while latterly it has not escaped criticism. On the one
hand, it is claimed that the concept of vested or acquired rights
cannot be applied except subject to certain qualifications, one
such qualification being that rights not in conformity with the
public and social order of the successor State, even if vested or
acquired, ought not to be binding upon that State. On the
other hand, some would reject the concept altogether, or at
least altogether in relation to newly emerged States having
problems of development, except in very special cases (e.g.,
debts of public utility).[^328/4]

The doctrine of vested or acquired rights did operate to
temper the stringency of earlier rules relating to succession to
contractual rights and obligations, including the rule of non-succession
laid down by the English Court of Appeal in West
Rand Central Gold Mining Co. v. R.[^329/1] in 1905 to the effect that in
the case of extinction of a predecessor State by conquest and
annexation, the successor State as conqueror remains entirely
free to decide whether or not to become subrogated to the
contractual rights and duties of its predecessor. The latter
view was indeed to some extent inconsistent with prior opinion
and practice, and _semble_ would not be followed today as an
absolute principle.

#### (3) Succession and Concessionary Contracts

The general weight of practice and opinion[^329/2] lies in the
direction of holding that obligations under concessionary
contracts are terminated upon changes of sovereignty resulting
in the extinction of the predecessor State,[^329/3] unless indeed the
successor State renews the concession.[^329/4] It is not clear why
this is necessarily so in every case,[^329/5] because even the executory
rights and obligations under the concession may correspond
to some substantial benefit which has accrued to the successor
State, making it only just and reasonable that the concessionaire
should continue to enjoy his rights. As against that consideration,
the concessionaire is in theory always entitled to obtain
compensation on just terms for the loss of his rights, including
the loss of executory rights, so that these rights would terminate
subject only to an obligation upon the successor State to make
due compensation. The concessionaire is often said to retain
an interest in the money invested and the labour expended, and
this, whether classified as an acquired right or otherwise, should
be respected by a successor State.[^330/1]

#### (4) Succession and Public Debts

Both practice and doctrine reveal great divergencies on the
question whether the successor State is obliged to take over
public debts.[^330/2]

On the face of it, the successor State, having obtained the
benefit of the loan by the very fact of taking over the territory,
should be responsible for the public debts of the predecessor
State relating to the territory that has passed. This principle
of responsibility, resting on the basis of "taking the burden
with the benefits" has been repeatedly upheld by the United
States.[^330/3] The same principle applies with particular force
where the visible benefits of the loan are directly associated
with the territory that has passed, for instance, if the proceeds
of the loan have been devoted to the erection of permanent
improvements on the territory.[^330/4]

At the same time, regard must be paid to the terms of the
actual contract of loan, and if the debt be secured on the
revenues of the predecessor State, and in respect of the territory
which passed, it would be unreasonable to make the successor
State liable beyond the taxable capacity of the territory which
has changed sovereigns.[^330/5]

No obligation accrues for a successor State in respect of a
public debt incurred for a purpose hostile to the successor
State, or for the benefit of some State other than the predecessor
State.[^331/1]

A difficult problem is that of the incidence of a public debt
of the predecessor State, the territory of which becomes
separated into several parts, each under the sovereignty of
new or existing States. The rule that the debt becomes
divided among the successors is favoured by doctrine,
although not supported by the award in the Ottoman Debt
Arbitration (1925).[^331/2] In practice, the debts of a predecessor
State have been apportioned by treaty[^331/3] among the successor
States according to some equitable method of distribution, for
example, proportionately to the revenues of each parcel of
transferred territory or rateably in some other reasonable
manner.

#### (5) Succession and Private or Municipal Law Rights

Such of these rights as have crystallised into vested or
acquired rights must be respected by the successor State, more
especially where the former municipal law of the predecessor
State has continued to operate, as though to guarantee the
sanctity of the rights.[^331/4]

However, the continuance of any such rights is subject to
any alterations affecting them made to the former municipal
law by the successor State, for there is no rule of international
law obliging the latter to maintain the former municipal legal
system. The successor State can always displace existing
rights and titles by altering the former municipal law, unless
in doing so, it breaks some other independent duty under
international law, for instance, by expropriating the property
of aliens arbitrarily, and not for a public purpose.

#### (6) Succession and Claims in Tort (or Delict)

There is no general principle of succession to delictual
liabilities.

According to the principles enunciated in two well-known
cases, the Robert E. Brown[^332/1] Claimand the Hawaiian Claims,[^332/2]
the successor State is not bound to respect an unliquidated
claim for damages in tort.[^332/3] If, however, the amount of the
claim has become liquidated by agreement of the parties or
through a judgment or award of a tribunal, then in the absence
of any suggestion of injustice or unreasonableness, the successor
State may be bound to settle the amount of this liquidated claim.
This rule is irrespective of whether the change of sovereignty is
forcible or voluntary. It is not clear even from the justifications
given for the rule, why it should apply as an invariable
proposition; for instance, where a tort relates to territory, as
where there has been a wrongful diversion of water, or where
some permanent benefit has accrued to the successor State, it
may in some circumstances be reasonable to bind the successor
State to respect the unliquidated claim against its predecessor.[^332/4]

#### (7) Succession and Public Funds and Public Property

It is generally recognised that the successor State takes over
the public funds and public property, whether movable or
immovable, of the predecessor State.[^332/5] This principle of
succession extends to public franchises and privileges, as well
as to rights of a proprietorial or pecuniary character.

#### (8) Succession and Nationality

The problem here is whether and to what extent the successor
State can claim as its nationals citizens of the predecessor
State.[^332/6] _Prima facie_, persons living or domiciled in the territory,
subject of change, acquire the nationality of the successor.
Difficulty arises in formulating rules concerning the position of
citizens of the predecessor, normally living or domiciled in
such territory, but outside it at the time of change.

There is no duty at international law upon the successor
State to grant any right of option as to citizenship, nor, correspondingly,
is there any duty upon the predecessor State to
withdraw its nationality from persons normally living or
domiciled in the transferred territory. Most cases, it will be
found, have been regulated in detail by treaty or agreement.

#### (9) Succession and Customary Rights Relating to Territory

In principle, a customary right relating to territory, which
has become established in favour of one State against the
predecessor State, must be respected by the successor State in
whom the particular territory subject to the right becomes
vested. The decision of the International Court of Justice in
the Right of Passage over Indian Territory Case (1960)[^333/1]
to the effect that Portugal was entitled to a certain right of
passage over Indian territory, which had first become established
by custom during British rule over India, is not a clear
authority for this proposition, because the practice constituting
the custom had continued as such for some time after India
succeeded to Great Britain so as in effect to amount to a custom
as between India and Portugal.[^333/2]

## PASSING OF RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UPON INTERNAL CHANGES OF SOVEREIGNTY

The principle which applies here is known as the principle
of continuity, namely, that notwithstanding internal alterations
in the organisation of government, or in the constitutional
structure of a particular State, the State itself continues to be
bound by its rights and obligations under international law,
including treaty rights and obligations.[^333/3] Hence each successive
Government is, as a rule, liable for the acts of its predecessors.

This principle received an extended application in 1947 in
the view which commanded general support that, despite the
considerable alterations to its Constitution when India emerged
as an independent State, it continued as an original Member
of the United Nations with all former rights and obligations.
That opinion prevailed in practice, the new India being automatically
recognised as a Member of the United Nations.[^334/1]

The principle of continuity is not to be applied unreasonably.
Hence, if the provisions of a treaty binding upon the State are
predicated, expressly or impliedly, on the assumption of a
specific form of government or a specific Constitution continuing,
and the latter are altered, the treaty will cease to bind
the new Government. Besides, there may be such fundamental
revolutionary changes with the advent of the new Government,
politically, economically, or socially, that it is impossible in
fact to hold the Government to certain serious or burdensome
obligations.[^334/2]

A problem of a special nature may arise in regard to a
Government which usurped office by illegal or unconstitutional
means, and established _de facto_ control for a period during
which various obligations were incurred towards other States.
If such other States had notice from the displaced Government
that no new treaty engagements entered into by the usurping
Government would be recognised if the displaced Government
re-established control, then _prima facie_ such treaties would be
entered into at the peril of the parties concerned, and the
Government displaced could claim not to be bound thereby
when it resumed office.

Another special case arises where an insurgent Government
is established temporarily as the _de facto_ Government in
control of a portion of the territory of the whole State and is
subsequently suppressed by the parent Government, as occurred
in the American Civil War when the Confederate Government
of the Southern States was overthrown. In such a case, the
parent Government is not responsible for the debts or delinquencies
of the insurgent Government[^335/1] unless, perhaps, the
debt be one incurred for the benefit of the State as a whole,
and in regard to alleged delinquencies, unless the parent
Government has itself broken some independent duty of international
law, for example, by facilitating the commission of
the delinquency.



[^320/1]: The subject has been covered in a number of valuable studies and documents
prepared or circulated by the United Nations Secretariat, and submtteid
to the International Law Commission for the purpose of its continuing work
on succession; these are listed in the Report of the Commission on the Work
of its Twenty-second Session (1970), paragraph 36, and the lengthy footnote 53
to this paragraph. For a specialist treatise, _see_ O'Connell, State Succession
in Municipal Law and International Law (two volumes, 1967).

[^320/2]: It bears the title "Succession of States and Governments" in the Report of
the International Law Commission on the Work of its Twenty-first Session in
1969 (_see_ title of Chapter III), and the title "Succession of States" in the
Report of the Commission on the Work of its Twenty-second Session in 1970
(_see_ title of Chapter III).

[^321/1]: The case must involve a real external change of sovereignty; thus when
Austria was liberated from German control in April, 1945, that liberation did
not create a new State for the purposes of succession to Germany; _see_ Jordan
V. Austrian Republic and Taubner (1947), Annual Digest of Public International
Law Cases, 1947, No. 15.

[^322/1]: E.g., the temporary legal sovereignty of the League of Nations, 1920--1935,
over the German territory of the Saar.

[^323/1]: Suggested tests or distinctions in the literature have been :---

    (a) The
    distinction between universal and partial succession.

    (b) Whether the international personality of the predecessor State has substantially continued
    through the change of sovereignty.

    (c) The distinction between personal and
    territorial rights and obligations.

to rights or obligations; _see_, e.g. Article 37 paragraph 1 of the Rome Convention
on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface,
signed at Rome on October 7, 1952, according to which, when the whole
or part of the territory of a Contracting State is transferred to a non-Contracting
State the Convention is to cease to apply to the territory so transferred
as from the date of transfer. A good example of voluntary succession is the
Agreement of August 7, 1965, relating to the Separation of Singapore from
Malaysia as an Independent and Sovereign State; _cf._ S. Jayakamur, "Singapore
and State Succession. International Relations and Internal Law",
International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 19 (1970), pp. 398--423.

[^324/2]: In the case of executed obligations under certain treaties, e.g., treaties of
cession or boundary demarcation, where there is a subsequent change of
sovereignty, no question of succession of treaty rights is involved, but the
territory, boundary, etc., simply passes to the successor State.

of the International Labour Organisation (I.L.O.) previously in force in

make a declaration that such Conventions will continue to be respected.

on May 28, 1968, to the United Nations Secretary-General, some four months
after attaining independence.

in which the concession was granted and the requirements of the new economic
policy of the successor State should be taken into consideration, and that the
right of new States to carry out nationalisations cannot be impeded by concessionary
contracts.

[^329/3]: If only part of the territory of the predecessor State is transferred, and
the concession relates to the resources of the remaining territory, presumably
the concessionaire retains his rights against the predecessor State.

[^329/4]: In practice successor States have frequently renewed concessions, although
it could not be inferred from this that they acknowledged a legal obligation
to do so.

[^329/5]: The intentions of the predecessor and successor States may in fact be
that the concession should continue; _see_ Hyde, International Law (2nd
edition, 1947), Vol. I, at pp. 425--8.

[^330/1]: _Cf._ also with regard to a concessionary contract, although the case rests
on its own peculiar facts, the _Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions Case_ (1924),
P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, at p. 28, and (1925), Series A, No. 5.

[^330/3]: E.g., in 1938 when it claimed that Nazi Germany, having absorbed Austria
by bloodless conquest, was liable to service former Austrian loans; _see_ Hyde,

[^330/5]: _See_ Hyde, _op. cit._, Vol. I, pp. 413--4, and pp. 416--7.

[^331/1]: Thus in 1898 at the peace negotiations between Spain and the United
States, which gained control over Cuba during its successful war with Spain,
the American Peace Commissioners refused to recognise a so-called Cuban
public debt, which had been raised by Spain for its own national purposes,
and for interests in some respects adverse to those of Cuba.
