## THE RELATION BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND STATE LAW

## GENERAL

Nothing is more essential to a proper grasp of the subject
of international law than a clear understanding of its relation
to State law. A thorough acquaintance with this topic is of
the utmost practical importance. Particularly is it of value in
clarifying the law of treaties---perhaps the most important
branch of international law, and one which impinges so
frequently on the domain of State law.

Although this book aims only at stating the fundamentals
of modern international law, it is desirable to give more than
a merely elementary account of the relation between international
law and State law. For this purpose, it is necessary
to include some treatment of the theoretical aspects before
dealing briefly with the practice observed by States at the
present time. The importance of such theoretical analysis
cannot be overrated, for numerous are the questions which
come for opinion before an international lawyer, involving a
nice consideration of the limits between international law and
State law. Apart from the aspect of theory, there is the
important practical problem of more immediate concern to
municipal Courts, namely, to what extent may such Courts
give effect within the municipal sphere to rules of international
law, both where such rules are, and where they are not in
conflict with municipal law. It is this problem which requires
a consideration of the practice of States. Besides, in the
international sphere, international tribunals may be called
upon to determine the precise status and effect of a rule of
municipal law, which is relied upon by one party to a case.


## THEORIES AS TO THE RELATION BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND STATE Law[^77/1]

The two principal theories are known as monism and dualism.
According to monism, international law and State law are
concomitant aspects of the one system-law in general;
according to dualism, they represent two entirely distinct
legal systems, international law having an intrinsically different
character from that of State law. Because a large number of
domestic legal systems are involved, the dualist theory is
sometimes known as the "pluralistic" theory, but it is believed
that the term "dualism" is more exact and less confusing.

### Dualism

Probably it is true to say that it would not have occurred to
the earliest writers on international law (for example, Suarez)
to doubt that a monistic construction of the two legal systems
was alone correct, believing as they did that "natural law"
conditioned the law of nations and the very existence of States.
But in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, partly as a result
of philosophic doctrines (for example, of Hegel) emphasising
the sovereignty of the State-will, and partly as a result of the
rise in modern States of legislatures with complete internal
legal sovereignty, there developed a strong trend towards the
dualist view.

The chief exponents of dualism have been the modern
positivist writers, Triepel[^77/2] and Anzilotti.[^77/3] For the "positivists",
with their consensual conception of international law, it was
natural to regard State law as a distinct system. Thus, according
to Triepel, there were two fundamental differences between
the two systems :---

(a) The subjects of State law are individuals,
while the subjects of international law are States solely and
exclusively. (b) Their juridical origins are different; the
source of State law is the will of the State itself, the source of
international law is the common will (_Gemeinwille_) of States.
As to point (a), we have already shown in Chapter 3 above
that it is far from correct, and that international law binds
individuals and entities other than States. As to (b), the
statement is somehow misleading; it begs the question to say
that the alleged _Gemeinwille_ is a source of international law,
because the really important question is under what circumstances
an expression of the _Gemeinwille_ can become decisive.
The natural inference is that over and above the _Gemeinwille_
there are fundamental principles of international law, superior
to it and indeed regulating its exercise or expression.

Anzilotti adopted a different approach; he distinguished
international law and State law according to the fundamental
principles by which each system is conditioned. In his view,
State law is conditioned by the fundamental principle or norm
that State legislation is to be obeyed, while international law
is conditioned by the principle _pacta sunt servanda_, i.e., agreements
between States are to be respected. Thus the two systems
are entirely separate, and Anzilotti maintained further that they
are so distinct that no conflicts between them are possible; there
may be references (_renvois_) from one to the other, but nothing
more. As to Anzilotti's theory, it is enough to say that for
reasons already given,[^78/1] it is incorrect to regard _pacta sunt
servanda_ as the underlying norm of international law; it is a
partial illustration of a much wider principle lying at the root
of international law.

Apart from the positivist writers, the theory of dualism has
received support from certain non-positivist writers and jurists,
and implicitly too from a number of Judges of municip
Courts.[^78/2] The reasoning of this class of dualists differs from
that of the positivist writers, since they look primarily to the
empirical differences in the formal sources of the two systems,
namely, that on the one hand, international law consists for
the most part of customary and treaty rules, whereas municipal
law, on the other hand, consists mainly of judge-made law and
of Statutes passed by municipal legislatures.

### Monism

Modern writers who favour the monistic construction
endeavour for the most part to found their views upon a
strictly scientific analysis of the internal structure of legal
systems as such.

By contrast with the writers adopting dualism, such followers
of monism regard all law as a single unity composed of binding
legal rules, whether those rules are obligatory on States, on
individuals, or on entities other than States. In their view,
the science of law is a unified field of knowledge, and the
decisive point is therefore whether or not international law is
true law. Once it be accepted as a hypothesis that international
law is a system of rules of a truly legal character, it is impossible
according to Kelsen[^79/1] and other monist writers to deny that
the two systems constitute part of that unity corresponding to
the unity of legal science. Thus any construction other than
monism, and in particular dualism, is bound to amount to a
denial of the true legal character of international law. There
cannot in the view of the monist writers be any escape from
the position that the two systems, because they are both
systems of legal rules, are interrelated parts of the one legal
structure.

There are, however, other writers who favour monism for
less abstract reasons, and who maintain, as a matter purely
of practical appraisal, that international law and State law
are both part of a universal body of legal rules binding all
human beings collectively or singly. In other words, it is the
individual who really lies at the root of the unity of all law.

### Question of Primacy

Where does primacy reside, in international law or in State
law? It is apparent from the attachment of dualistic theory
to the sovereignty of the State-will that it ascribes primacy
to State law.

On this point, the protagonists of monism are somewhat
divided. Kelsen's answer, for instance, is to make a structural
analysis of international law and State law. Here he applies
his well-known "hierarchical" doctrine according to which
legal rules are conditioned by other rules or principles from
which they derive their validity and binding force; thus the
rule laid down in regulations or statutory orders is conditioned
by the superior rule laid down in a Statute, and it in its turn
by the rule laid down in the Constitution, and so on.

> Law has the peculiarity of governing its own creation; a
rule of law determines how another rule will be laid down; in
this sense the latter depends on the former; it is this bond of
dependence which links together the different elements of the
legal order, which constitutes its principle of unity.

From principle to principle, and from rule to rule, legal
analysis eventually reaches one supreme fundamental norm[^80/1]
which is the source and foundation of all law. Beyond this
fundamental postulate, one which may be taken as conditioning
both the validity and content of norms of lower degree in the
hierarchy, the analytical jurist cannot venture, as the ultimate
origins of law are determined by non-legal considerations.

Peculiarly enough, Kelsen takes the view that this fundamental
postulate may belong either to international law or
to State law. According to him, the thesis of the primacy
of State law is perfectly legitimate, and he adopts this attitude
for the reason that in his opinion the choice between either
system cannot be decided, as in the natural sciences, in a
strictly scientific way. In his own words[^80/2] :---

> It cannot be asserted, as in the natural sciences, that the
preferable hypothesis is the one which embraces the greatest
number of given facts. For, here, we are not dealing with
materials, with perceptible realities, but with rules of law---
data uncertain by their very nature.

It has been objected against Kelsen's view of such an option
between international law and State law that his attitude is
rooted in too sceptical a philosophic approach,[^81/1] and that there
are also fundamental difficulties which this view fails to resolve.
For instance, there is the point that if international law were
not the higher legal order, primacy would have to be attributed
to over one hundred and more different and separate systems of
State law, which would virtually amount to an affirmation of
international anarchy. Moreover, the thesis of the ultimate
primacy of State law breaks down in two crucial cases :---

(a) If international law drew its validity only from a State
Constitution, it would necessarily cease to be in force once the
Constitution on which its authority rested, disappeared. But
nothing is more certain than that the valid operation of international
law is independent of change or abolition of Constitutions,
or of revolutions. This was so declared by the
London Conference of 1831 which decided that Belgium should
be an independent and neutralised State. The Conference
expressly upheld the fundamental principle that "treaties do
not lose their force despite internal constitutional changes".

(b) The entry of new States into the international Society.
It is well established that international law binds the new
State without its consent, and such consent if expressed is
merely declaratory of the true legal position.[^81/2] Besides, there
is a duty on every State to bring not only its laws, but also its
Constitution, into harmony with international law.

It may be argued in favour of State primacy that States
have the very widest liberties and exercise almost complete
sovereignty. The answer to this argument is that State
sovereignty represents no more than the competence, however
wide, which States enjoy within the limits of international law.
Here the analogy of a Federal State is useful. The individual
member States of a Federation may enjoy a very wide measure
of independence, but legal primacy none the less resides in
the Federal Constitution.

This analogy of Federal States is important for one further
reason. Accepting the view that primacy belongs to international
law, the question arises :---does this reside in international
law as a whole, or only in a particular group of its
rules and principles? The latter is the better view, and on the
analogy of Federal Constitutions we are entitled to deduce that
there is in a sense an international constitutional law which
conditions both State law, and the remaining body of international
law much in the same way as a constitutional instrument
in a Federal State conditions both provincial law and the
law under Federal Statutes and regulations made pursuant to
the constitutional powers.

### "Transformation" and "Specific Adoption" Theories

The above discussion would be incomplete without briefly
referring to certain theories concerning the application of
international law within the municipal sphere.

On the one hand, the "positivists" have put forward the view
that the rules of international law cannot directly and _ex proprio
vigore_ be applied within the municipal sphere by State Courts
or otherwise; in order to be so applied such rules must undergo
a process of _specific adoption_ by, or specific incorporation into,
municipal law. Since, according to positivist theory, international
law and State law constitute two strictly separate and
structurally different systems, the former cannot impinge upon
State law unless the latter, a logically complete system, allows
its constitutional machinery to be used for that purpose. In
the case of treaty rules, it is claimed that there must be a
transformation of the treaty, and this transformation of the
treaty into State law,[^82/1] which is not merely a formal but a
substantive requirement, alone validates the extension to
individuals of the rules laid down in treaties.

These theories rest on the supposed consensual character of
international law as contrasted with the non-consensual nature
of State law. In particular, the transformation theory is based
on an alleged difference between treaties on the one hand, and
State laws or regulations on the other; according to the theory,
there is a difference between treaties which are of the nature
of promises, and municipal Statutes which are of the nature
of commands. It follows from this basic difference that a
transformation from one type to the other is formally and
substantively indispensable. Critics of the transformation
theory have objected that this point is somewhat artificial.
They maintain that if due regard be paid to the real function
of provisions in treaties or in Statutes it will be seen that the
one no more "promises" than the other "commands". The
real object of treaties and of Statutes---indeed their common
ground---is to stipulate that certain situations of fact will
involve certain determinate legal consequences. The distinction
between promise and command is relevant to form and
procedure but not to the true legal character of these instruments.
It is therefore incorrect to consider that the transformation
from one to the other is materially essential.

In answer to the transformation theory, the critics have put
forward a theory of their own---the delegation theory. According
to this theory there is delegated to each State Constitution by
constitutional rules of international law, the right to determine
when the provisions of a treaty or Convention are to come
into force and the manner in which they are to be embodied
in State law. The procedure and methods to be adopted for
this purpose by the State are a continuation of the process
begun with the conclusion of the treaty or Convention. There
is no transformation, there is no fresh creation of rules or
municipal law, but merely a prolongation of one single act of
creation. The constitutional requirements of State law are
thus merely part of a unitary mechanism for the creation of law.

Whatever be the ultimate merits of this theoretical controversy
over the alleged necessity for a transformation or
specific adoption of international law by municipal law, the
actual practice of States concerning the application of international
law within the municipal sphere must remain of
critical importance. It is therefore proposed to pass to a
consideration of such State practice, and then to derive therefrom
any necessary conclusions relative to the matter.

## STATE PRACTICE AS TO OPERATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW WITHIN MUNICIPAL SPHERE

The object of the present discussion is to ascertain in what
manner and to what extent municipal Courts do apply a rule
of international law. How far do they give effect to it automatically,
and how far is some specific municipal measure
of statutory or judicial incorporation required before that rule
can be recognised as binding within the municipal sphere?
A further question is, how far a rule of international law will
be applied by a municipal Court if it actually conflicts with a
rule of municipal law judge-made or statutory rule. The answers
to these questions will be found to require distinctions to be
made, on the one hand, between customary and treaty rules
of international law; and on the other between statutory and
judge-made municipal law.

### British Practice

British practice draws a distinction between :---

(i) customary
rules of international law;

(ii) rules laid down by treaties.


(i).---The rule as to customary international law according
to the current of modern judicial authority is that customary
rules of international law are deemed to be part of the law of
the land, and will be applied as such by British municipal
Courts, subject to two important qualifications :---

  (a) That such rules are not inconsistent with British Statutes,[^84/1]
  whether the Statute be earlier or later in date than the particular
  customary rule concerned.

  (b) That once the scope of such customary rules has been
  determined by British Courts of final authority, all British
  Courts are thereafter bound by that determination, even
  though a divergent customary rule of international law later
  develops.[^84/2]

These qualifications must be respected by British municipal
Courts, notwithstanding that the result may be to override a
rule of international law; the breach of such a rule is not a
matter for the Courts, but concerns the Executive in the
domain of its relations with foreign Powers.[^85/1]

The rule as stated above is somewhat narrower than that
which was formerly applicable. In the eighteenth century, by
a doctrine known sometimes as the "Blackstonian" doctrine
(because so affirmed by Blackstone) but more generally as the
"incorporation" doctrine, customary international law was
deemed automatically to be part of the common law and the
two above-mentioned qualifications were not expressly formulated.[^85/2]
Thus Blackstone's statement of the doctrine was in
these terms[^85/3] :---

> The law of nations, wherever any question arises which
is properly the object of its jurisdiction is here adopted in its
full extent by the common law, and it is held to be a part of
the law of the land.

This doctrine was favoured not only by Blackstone but also by
Lord Mansfield and other Judges in the eighteenth century.[^85/4]

During the nineteenth century it was reaffirmed in a succession
of decisions by distinguished common law and equity
Judges; in Dolder v. Huntingfield (1805) by Lord Eldon,[^85/5] in
Wolff v. Oxholm (1817) by Lord Ellenborough,[^85/6] in Novello v.
Toogood (1823) by Abbott, C.J.,[^85/7] in De Wutz v. Hendricks
(1824) by Best, C.J.,[^85/8] and in Emperor of Austria v. Day (1861)
by Stuart, V.-C.[^85/9] In terms the Courts of law and equity stated
that they would give effect to settled rules of international
law as part of English law. This did not mean, however, that
they would enforce international law if it conflicted with an
English Statute or judicial decision.

In 1876, in R. v. Keyn (The Franconia),[^86/1] the Court for Crown
Cases Reserved held by a majority that English Courts had no
jurisdiction over crimes committed by foreigners within the
maritime belt extending to three miles from the English coast,
although it was claimed that such jurisdiction belonged to
them under international law. This decision was nullified by
Parliament passing the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act of
1878 to give English Courts jurisdiction in such circumstances,
but the judicial opinions expressed in the case seemed to throw
doubts on the scope of the incorporation doctrine. According
to these, an English Court could not give any effect to
rules of international law unless such rules were proved
to have been adopted by Great Britain, in common with
other nations, in a positive manner. Moreover if such
rules conflicted with established principles of the English
common law, an English Court was bound not to apply them.
But in 1905, in the decision of West Rand Gold Mining Co. v.
R.,[^86/2] there was a partial return to the traditional "incorporation"
doctrine, albeit the Court of Appeal in that case reaffirmed it
in none too positive terms.

In a number of later pronouncements, the doctrine again
received recognition, though in somewhat hesitant language,
and with certain qualifications. Thus Lord Atkin declared
in Chung Chi Cheung v. R.[^86/3] :---

>The Courts acknowledge the existence of a body of rules
which nations accept among themselves. On any judicial
issue they seek to ascertain what the relevant rule is, and, having
found it, they will treat it as incorporated into the domestic
law, so far as it is not inconsistent with rules enacted by Statutes
or finally declared by their tribunals.

In addition to the qualifications stated by Lord Atkin, that a
customary rule must not be inconsistent with Statutes or prior
judicial decisions of final authority, it is also a condition
precedent that the rule is one generally accepted by the
international community.

> It is a recognised prerequisite of the adoption in our
municipal law of a doctrine of public international law that
it shall have attained the position of general acceptance by
civilised nations as a rule of international conduct, evidenced
by international treaties and conventions, authoritative textbooks,
practice, and judicial decisions.[^87/1]

Moreover it is now clear that, contrary to certain _dicta_ in
R. v. Keyn (The Franconia), p. 86, _ante_, an English Court can in a
proper case, if there are no established rules on a particular
point, apply the unanimous opinion of jurists.[^87/2] At the same
time, many other judicial utterances still reflect an attitude
rather hostile to the incorporation doctrine.

On one extreme view, which is reflected in certain judicial
utterances in R. v. Keyn (The Franconia), _supra_, customary
rules of international law could never be applied by British
municipal Courts unless they had been embodied in a British
Statute, but so far-reaching an opinion is contradicted by the
whole current of recent authority. A more moderate view is
that international law is not a part of British domestic law, but
may be a "source" of rules applied by a British Court[^87/3]; if,
however, this meant that a British Judge were free to reject a
generally recognised customary rule of international law, it
would be contrary to authority.

Apart from the two qualifications to the rule as stated above,
there are two important exceptions to the automatic applicability
of customary international law by British municipal
Courts :---

(1) Acts of State by the Executive, for example a declaration
of war, or an annexation of territory, may not be questioned
by British municipal Courts, notwithstanding that a breach of
international law may have been involved.[^88/1]

(2) British municipal Courts regard themselves as bound by
a certificate or authoritative statement on behalf of the Executive
(that is to say, the Crown) in regard to certain matters falling
peculiarly within the Crown's prerogative powers, such as
the _de jure_ or _de facto_ recognition of States and Governments,
the sovereign nature of Governments, and the diplomatic status
of persons claiming jurisdictional immunity on the grounds of
diplomatic privilege, although such certificate or statement may
be difficult to reconcile with existing rules of international law.[^88/2]
Notwithstanding judicial doubts as to its scope, the incorporation
doctrine has left its definite mark in two established rules
recognised by British Courts :---

(a) A rule of construction. Acts of Parliament are to be
interpreted so as not to conflict with international law. There
is indeed a presumption that Parliament did not intend to
commit a breach of international law.[^88/3] But this rule of
construction does not apply if the Statute is otherwise clear
and unambiguous,[^88/4] in which case it must be applied, although
there is nothing to debar the Court from expressly ruling that
the Statute is in breach of customary rules of international law.[^88/5]

(b) A rule of evidence. International law need not, like
foreign law, be proved as a fact by expert evidence or otherwise.
The British Courts will take judicial notice of its rules, and
may of their own volition refer to text-books and other sources
for evidence thereof.[^88/6]

In the matter of giving effect to international law, the position
of British Prize Courts is different from that of the Courts of
common law and equity. Prize Courts are specifically
appointed to apply international law, and according to the
leading case of The Zamora[^89/1] are not bound by an executive
Order-in-Council which contravenes or purports to alter a rule
of international law, although presumably they would be
obliged to follow an Act of Parliament in breach of international
law.

(ii).---The British practice as to treaties, as distinct from
customary international law, is conditioned primarily by the
constitutional principles governing the relations between the
Executive (that is to say, the Crown) and Parliament. The
negotiation, signature, and ratification of treaties are matters
belonging to the prerogative powers of the Crown. If, however,
the provisions of a treaty made by the Crown were to become
operative within Great Britain automatically and without any
specific act of incorporation, this might lead to the result that
the Crown could alter the British municipal law or otherwise
take some important step without consulting Parliament or
obtaining Parliament's approval.

Hence it has become established that[^89/2] :---

(a) Treaties which :---

(1) affect the private rights of British
subjects, or

(2) involve any modification of the common or
Statute law[^89/3] by virtue of their provisions or otherwise,[^89/4] or

(3) require the vesting of additional powers in the Crown,
or

(4) impose additional financial obligations, direct or contingent,
upon the Government of Great Britain, must receive
parliamentary assent through an enabling Act of Parliament,
and, if necessary, any legislation to effect the requisite changes
in the law must be passed.[^90/1]

(b) Treaties made expressly subject to the approval of
Parliament require its approval, which is usually given in the
form of a Statute, though sometimes by Resolution.

(c) Treaties involving the cession of British territory require
the approval of Parliament given by a Statute.

(d) No legislation is required for certain specific classes of
treaties, namely, treaties modifying the belligerent rights of the
Crown when engaged in maritime warfare[^90/2] (presumably because
such treaties involve no major intrusion on the legislative
domain of Parliament), and administrative agreements of an
informal character needing only signature, but not ratification,
provided they do not involve any alteration of municipal law.
Where under the above-mentioned rules, a British treaty is
required to be implemented by legislation, a mere general or
vague allusion to the treaty in a Statute is not sufficient to
constitute the necessary legislative implementation.[^90/3]

It follows also that, where a Statute contains provisions
which are unambiguously[^90/4] inconsistent with those of an earlier
treaty, a British municipal Court must apply the Statute in
preference to the treaty. _Semble_, however, where the Statute
is ambiguous, and its provisions have been conditioned by a
previously concluded treaty, the Court may look at the treaty
for the purpose of interpreting the ambiguous statutory language,
notwithstanding that the Statute does not specifically
incorporate or refer to the treaty.[^90/5]

According to the decision of the House of Lords in
Ostime v. Australian Mutual Provident Society[^91/1] where a treaty
has been duly implemented by legislation, this enactment will
prevail over conflicting earlier "unilateral" legislation.

### American Practice

In the matter of customary rules of international law, the
American practice is very similar to the British practice.
Such rules are administered as part of the law of the land,[^91/2]
and Acts of the United States Congress are construed so as
not to conflict therewith,[^91/3] although a later clear Statute will
prevail over earlier customary international law.[^91/4] Also, an
American Court is entitled to ascertain the rules of international
law on a particular point by referring to text-books, State
practice, and other sources.[^91/5] Deference is, however, paid to
the views of the Executive, as in the case of British Courts, to
the extent that American municipal Courts regard themselves
as bound by the certificates or "suggestions" of the Executive
regarding such matters as the recognition of foreign States and
Governments, and the territorial limits of a foreign country.

But so far as treaties are concerned, there is a radical
difference from the British practice. The American practice
does not depend like the British practice upon any reconciliation
between the prerogative powers of the executive and the
legislative domain of Parliament, but upon the provisions of
the United States Constitution stipulating that treaties are
"the supreme law of the land" (_see_ Article VI, § 2), and upon
a distinction drawn by American Courts between "self-executing"
and and "non-self-executing" treaties.[^91/6] A self-executing
treaty is one which does not in the view of American
Courts expressly or by its nature require legislation to make
it operative within the municipal field, and that is to be determined
by regard to the intention of the signatory parties and
to the surrounding circumstances.[^92/1] If a treaty is within the
terms of the Constitution, and it is self-executing within the
meaning just referred to, then under the Constitution it is
deemed to be operative as part of the law of the United States,
and will prevail, also, over a customary rule of international
law.[^92/2] On the other hand, treaties which are not self-executing,
but require legislation, are not binding upon American Courts
until the necessary legislation is enacted.[^92/3] This distinction
involves some anomalies, and in 1952, Senator Bricker's
proposed amendment to the Constitution included a provision
to make all treaties, in effect, non-self-executing.

Generally recognised customary rules of international law,
and self-executing treaties or Conventions ratified by the
United States, are binding on American Courts, even if in conflict
with previous American Statutes,[^92/4] provided that there is no

conflict with the United States Constitution.[^93/1] But a Statute
passed by Congress overrules previous treaties that have
become the law of the land,[^93/2] although there is a presumption
that Congress did not intend to overrule such treaties, and
unless the purpose of Congress to overrule international law
has been clearly expressed, such abrogation or modification
will not be deemed to have been carried out.[^93/3]

### Practice of States other than Great Britain and the United States

The practice of States other than Great Britain and the .
United States reveals wide variations both in the requirements
of constitutional law, and in the attitudes of municipal Courts
concerning the application therein of customary international
law and of treaties.

So far as one can sum up this practice, and despite the hazard
of generalisation on so complex a matter, the following
propositions may be ventured :---

(1) In a large number of States, customary rules of international
law are applied as part of internal law by municipal
Courts, without the necessity for any specific act of incorporation,
provided that there is no conflict with existing municipal law.

(2) Only a minority[^93/4] of States follow a practice whereby,
without the necessity for any specific act of incorporation,
their municipal Courts apply customary rules of international
law to the extent of allowing these to prevail in case of conflict
with a municipal Statute or municipal judge-made law.

(3) There is no uniform practice concerning the application
of treaties within the municipal sphere. Each country has its
own particularities as regards promulgation or publication of
treaties, legislative approval of treaty provisions, and so on.[^93/5]
Moreover, certain treaties, such as informal administrative
arrangements, are never submitted to the legislature. Also
the Courts in some countries, for example the German Federal
Republic, will, like American Courts, give effect to self-executing
treaties, that is to say, those capable of application without the
necessity of legislative implementation. In other countries, for
example, Belgium, legislative enactment or legislative approval is
necessary for almost all treaties, particularly those which affect
the status of private citizens.[^94/1] As to conflicts between the provisions
of treaties and earlier or later Statutes, it is only in
relatively few countries that the superiority of the treaty in this
regard is established. France is a case in point, for if a treaty
has been duly ratified in accordance with law, French tribunals,
both judicial and administrative, will give effect to it, notwithstanding
a conflict with internal legislation. But in most
countries, for example, Norway, treaties do not _per se_ operate
to supersede State legislation or judge-made law. Exceptionally,
however, there are some countries the Courts of which go so far
as to give full force to treaties, even conflicting with the provisions
of the Constitution of the country concerned.

(4) In general, there is discernible a considerable weight of
State practice requiring that in a municipal Court, primary
regard be paid to municipal law, irrespective of the applicability
of rules of international law, and hence relegating the question
of any breach of international law to the diplomatic domain.

Reference should be made in this connection to certain
modern Constitutions, containing far-reaching provisions to
the effect that international law shall be treated as an integral
part of municipul law. A current example is Article 25 of the
Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (the West
German Republic) which lays down that the general rules of
international law shall form part of Federal law, and shall take
precedence over the laws of and create rights and duties directly
for the inhabitants of the Federal territory.[^94/2] It has been
claimed that this and similar constitutional provisions reflect a
growing tendency among States to acknowledge the supremacy
of international law within the municipal sphere. Be that as
it may, it is none the less curious that these constitutional
provisions appear to support the positivist thesis that before
international law can be applicable by municipal Courts some
specific adoption by municipal law is required, since it is only
in virtue of these provisions of municipal constitutional law
that the rules of international law are valid and applicable
within the municipal sphere. This reasoning may well be
carried a stage further; even the Anglo-American judge-made
doctrine that customary international law, subject to certain
qualifications, forms part of the law of the land,[^95/1] appears to
be a doctrine of municipal law on the same plane as express
municipal constitutional provisions of similar effect and to
support the view that a specific municipal adoption of international
law is required. Yet, admitting this, it must still be
added that it is unlikely that when the British "incorporation"
doctrine was first enunciated by British Courts in the eighteenth
century, such Courts were purporting to declare a principle of
municipal constitutional law rather than to acknowledge the
validity as such of the law of nations.

In regard, however, to the application of treaties within the
municipal sphere, the above survey of State practice does not
support the thesis that some municipal transformation is
required in every case before treaties become operative in the
municipal field. The necessity for some formal municipal
change appears to depend upon two matters principally :---

(1) The nature and provisions of the particular treaty
concerned. Thus some treaties are self-operating or self-executing,
and do not require any legislative implementation,
as appears from the State practice considered above.

(2) The constitutional or administrative practice of each
particular State (_see above_). Also, it frequently happens that
certain States (an outstanding illustration is Austria) allow the
execution of a treaty to proceed by administrative practice
alone without enacting laws or issuing regulations. In such
a case, there is no structural transformation of the rules laid
down in the treaty.

## INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS AND THE OPERATION OF MUNICIPAL LAW

The fact that municipal Courts must pay primary regard to
municipal law in the event of a conflict with international law,
in no way affects the obligations of the State concerned to
perform its international obligations. A municipal Court which
defers to municipal law, notwithstanding an inconsistent rule
of international law, itself acts in breach of international law,
and will, as an organ of the State, engage the international
responsibility of that State. Hence, before an international
tribunal, a respondent State cannot plead that its municipal
law (not even its Constitution[^96/1]) contains rules which conflict
with international law, nor can it plead the absence of any
legislative provision or of a rule of internal law as a defence to
a charge that it has broken international law. This point was
well put in the course of proceedings in the Finnish Ships
Arbitration[^96/2] :---

> As to the manner in which its municipal law is framed,
the State has under international law, a complete liberty of
action, and its municipal law is a domestic matter in which no
other State is entitled to concern itself, provided that the
municipal law is such as to give effect to all the international
obligations of the State.

This may even import a duty upon a State, in an appropriate
case, to pass the necessary legislation to fulfil its international
obligations.[^96/3] To this extent, the primacy of international law
is preserved.

The same rule applies with regard to treaties. A State
cannot plead that its domestic law exonerated it from performing
obligations imposed by an international treaty,
unless in giving its consent to the treaty, a fundamental rule of
municipal law concerning constitutional competence to conclude
the treaty concerned was broken, and this breach of
municipal constitutional law was manifest.[^97/1]
This overriding regard for international law before international
tribunals does not mean that the rules of municipal
law are irrelevant in cases before international tribunals.
Frequently, on the threshold of the determination of some
international claim, it is necessary for an international tribunal
to ascertain or interpret or apply municipal law, for example,
where it is claimed that a denial of justice by a municipal
tribunal has taken place, or where a treaty provision, calling
for interpretation, refers to municipal law,[^97/2] or sometimes merely
for the purpose of elucidating the facts. Again, international
tribunals are often constrained to consider the municipal laws
of States generally, to ascertain whether cumulatively they lead
to the inference that a customary rule of international law has
evolved.[^97/3] Or it may be that for the purpose of assisting in the
determination of a difficult point of international law, an
international tribunal will have regard to municipal law or to
the special characteristics of municipal legal institutions,[^97/4]
or in an appropriate case may have recourse to analogies
drawn from municipal law.

In this connection, a close study of the pleadings and arguments
in the cases decided by the Permanent Court of International
Justice and its present successor, the International
Court of Justice, shows how important a role municipal law
played in each instance. Indeed, few were the cases in which
these Courts reached a solution without the most minute
examination of the municipal law relevant to the questions
calling for determination, while one of the most striking
aspects of the process by which both Courts arrived at their
decisions was the manner in which, almost spontaneously, the
issues of international law emerged and became disengaged
from the mass of municipal legal material relied upon by the
parties in the pleadings and in the oral proceedings.

## CONCEPT OF OPPOSABILITY

The concept of opposability (French, opposabilité), which
has come into current use in the field of international law,[^98/1]
is of some value where the relationship between international
law and municipal law is concerned.

In a dispute before an international tribunal between two
States, A and B, where State A relies upon some ground in
support of its claim, State B may seek to invoke as against,
i.e., "oppose" to State A some rule, institution, or régime under
State B's domestic law in order to defeat the ground of claim
set up by State A. As a general principle, if the domestic rule,
institution, or régime is in accordance with international law,
this may be legitimately "opposed" to State A in order to
negate its ground of claim,[^98/2] but if not in accordance with international
law, the domestic rule, institution, or régime may not
be so "opposed".[^99/1]

The convenience of the concept of opposability lies in the fact
that if a rule of domestic law is held to be non-opposable, this
does not necessarily mean that the rule ceases to be valid in the
domestic domain; and, in any event, as Kelsen has pointed out,[^99/2]
international law provides no procedure of invalidation, within
the domestic framework, of a rule of municipal law. If the
position be that the rule of domestic law, held to be non-opposable,
is itself invalid by reference to the provisions of
domestic constitutional law, then the rule is not opposable also
to States other than the claimant State, unless perhaps such
other States have expressly waived the constitutional invalidity
of the rule.

Of course, a treaty rule may be opposable by one State to
another State, in respect to the latter's ground of claim, in the
same way as with a rule of domestic law, and similarly if the
treaty rule is deemed to be non-opposable, it may rone the less
be validly opposable to certain States other than the claimant
State.[^99/3]

According to the Advisory Opinion of June 21, 1971, of the
International Court of Justice on the _Legal Consequences for
States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in South West
Africa (Namibia)_,[^99/4] even a determination of the United Nations
Security Council, which correctly declares that a certain situation
is illegal, may be opposable to all States, whether Members
or non-Members, that may seek to rely upon the legality of the
situation. Thus, in the Court's opinion, the termination of
South Africa's mandate over South West Africa, by reason of
its refusal to submit to the supervision of United Nations
organs, and the consequence that its presence in the territory
was illegal, according to the terms of a Security Council
Resolution of 1970, were opposable to all States in the sense of
barring _erga omnes_ the legality of South Africa's continued
administration of the mandate.
