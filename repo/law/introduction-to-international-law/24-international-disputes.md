## INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES

## GENERAL

The expression "international disputes covers not only
disputes between States as such, but also other cases that have
come within the ambit of international regulation, being certain
categories of disputes between States on the one hand, and
individuals, bodies corporate, and non-State entities on the
other.[^451/1]

The present chapter is, however, mainly concerned with
disputes between States, and these may range from minor
differences scarcely causing a ripple on the international surface
to the other extreme of situations of prolonged friction and
tension between countries, attaining such a pitch as to menace
peace and security.

To settle international disputes as early as possible, and in a
manner fair and just to the parties involved, has been a longstanding
aim of international law, and the rules and procedure
in this connection are partly a matter of custom or practice,
and partly due to a number of important law-making Conventions
such as the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907
for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes and the
United Nations Charter drawn up at San Francisco in 1945.
One of the principal objects of the latter Charter in setting up
the United Nations Organisation was indeed to facilitate the
peaceful settlement of differences between States. This also
had been the purpose of the League of Nations during the
period of its activities between two World Wars.
Broadly speaking, the methods of settling international
disputes fall into two categories :---

(1) Peaceful means of settlement, that is, where the parties
are agreeable to finding an amicable solution.

(2) Forcible or coercive means of settlement, that is, where
a solution is found and imposed by force.

Each class will be discussed in turn,

## PEACEFUL OR AMICABLE MEANS OF SETTLEMENT[^452/1]

The peaceful or amicable methods of settling international
disputes are divisible into the following :---

(a) Arbitration.

(b) Judicial settlement,

(c) Negotiation, good offices, mediation, conciliation, or
inquiry.

(d) Settlement under the auspices of the United Nations
Organisation.

This classification does not mean that these processes remain
in rigidly separate compartments, each appropriate for resolving
one particular class of dispute. The position is otherwise in
practice. For example, the flexible machinery established by
the Convention of March 18, 1965, for the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and the Nationals of
Other States consists of an International Centre for the Settlement
of Investment Disputes, at Washington, with facilities
for the arbitration and conciliation of investment disputes,[^452/2]
and provision for Panels of Arbitrators and Conciliators.
Again the model body of rules drawn up in February, 1962,
by the Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, The
Hague (_see_ _post._), for cases where the Bureau has made available
its premises and facilities for settling disputes, one only of the
parties involved being a State, allows a dispute to be submitted
to a sequence, first of conciliation, and then of arbitration, in
the event that a conciliation commission reports that conciliation
has failed (_see_ section III).

#### (a) Arbitration[^453/1]

Ordinarily, arbitration denotes exactly the same procedure
as in municipal law, namely the reference of a dispute to
certain persons called arbitrators, freely chosen by the parties,
who make an award without being bound to pay strict regard
to legal considerations. Experience of international practice
has shown, however, that many disputes involving purely legal
issues are referred to arbitrators for settlement on a legal basis.
Moreover, in the various treaties by which it has been agreed
that disputes should be submitted to arbitration, frequently in
addition to being directed to make their award according to
justice or equity or ex aequo et bono, arbitral tribunals have
been specially instructed to apply international law. A common
formula in the nineteenth century was the direction to
give a decision "in accordance with the principles of international
law and the practice and jurisprudence of similar
tribunals of the highest authority".

Arbitration is an institution of great antiquity (_see_ Chapter 1,
_ante_), but its recent modern history is recognised as dating from
the Jay Treaty of 1794 between the United States and Great
Britain, providing for the establishment of three joint mixed
commissions to settle certain differences which could not
otherwise be disposed of in the course of the negotiation of the
Treaty. Although these commissions were not strictly speaking
organs of third party adjudication, two of the three performed
successfully, and the result was to stimulate a fresh interest in
the process of arbitration which had fallen into desuetude
for about two centuries. A further impetus to arbitration
was given by the Alabama Claims Award of 1872 between the
United States and Great Britain. According to Judge Manly
O. Hudson[^454/1] :---

>The success of the _Alabama Claims Arbitration_ stimulated
a remarkable activity in the field of international arbitration.
In the three decades following 1872, arbitral tribunals functioned
with considerable success in almost a hundred cases; Great
Britain took part in some thirty arbitrations, and the United
States in twenty; European States were parties in some sixty,
and Latin American States in about fifty cases.

Clauses providing for the submission of disputes to arbitration
were also frequently inserted in treaties, particularly "law-making"
Conventions, and to quote Judge Manly O. Hudson
again,[^454/2] "arbitration thus became the handmaiden of international
legislation" inasmuch as disputes concerning the
interpretation or application of the provisions of Conventions
could be submitted to it for solution. Also a number of
arbitration treaties for the settlement of defined classes of
disputes between the States parties were concluded.

A most important step was taken in 1899 when the Hague
Conference not only codified the law as to arbitration but also
laid the foundations of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.
The Hague Conference of 1907 completed the work of the 1899
Conference. The Permanent Court of Arbitration is an
institution of a peculiar character. It is neither "permanent"
nor is it a "Court". The members of the "Court" are
appointed by States which are parties to one or both of the
Conventions adopted by the Hague Conferences. Each State
may appoint four persons with qualifications in international
law, and all the persons so appointed constitute a panel of
competent lawyers from whom arbitrators are appointed as
the need arises. Thus the members of the Permanent Court
of Arbitration never meet as a tribunal.[^454/3]

 >Their sole function ... is to be available for service as
members of tribunals which may be created when they are
invited to undertake such service.[^455/1]

When a dispute arises which two States desire to submit to
arbitration by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the
following procedure applies :---Each State appoints two arbitrators,
of whom one only may be its national or chosen from
among the persons nominated by it as members of the Court
panel. These arbitrators then choose an umpire who is
merely a presiding member of the arbitral tribunal. The
award is given by majority vote. Each tribunal so created
will act pursuant to a special compromis or arbitration agreement,
specifying the subject of the dispute and the time allowed for
appointing the members of the tribunal, and defining the
tribunal's jurisdiction, the procedure to be followed, and the
rules of law and the principles according to which its decision
is to be given. The Permanent Court of Arbitration itself has
no specific jurisdiction as such. Approximately twenty arbitral
tribunals have been appointed under this system since its
foundation, and several important awards have been given,
including those in the Pious Fund Case of 1902 between the
United States and Mexico, the Muscat Dhows Case of 1905
between Great Britain and France, the North Atlantic Coast
Fisheries Case of 1910 between the United States and Great
Britain, and the Savarkar Case of 1911 between Great Britain
and France. In practice, a small number of specially
experienced members of the Court panel have been repeatedly
selected for duty as arbitrators, a practice that has obvious
advantages.

Notwithstanding its obvious defects---as Judge Manly O.
Hudson says it was hardly more than "a method and a
procedure"[^455/2]---_the Permanent Court of Arbitration_ was
a relative success, and in the early years of this century
influenced a more frequent recourse to arbitration as a method
of settling international disputes, while it may be said to have
moulded the modern law and practice of arbitration. This was
reflected, too, in the great number of arbitration treaties, both
multilateral and bilateral, and of special _ad hoc_ submission
agreements, concluded before and after the First World War.

Following on the First World War, several important
arbitral tribunals were set up. Among these may be mentioned
the several Mexican Claims Commissions which adjudicated
the claims of six different States against Mexico on behalf of
their subjects, and the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals set up in
Europe to deal with various claims arising out of the territorial
redistribution effected by the Treaty of Versailles, 1919.[^456/1]

Arbitration is essentially a consensual procedure. States
cannot be compelled to arbitrate unless they agree to do so,
either generally and in advance, or _ad hoc_ in regard to a specific
dispute. Their consent even governs the nature of the tribunal
established.

The structure of arbitral tribunals has accordingly in practice
revealed anomalies. Sometimes a single arbitrator has adjudicated
a dispute, at other times a joint commission of members
appointed by the States in dispute, and very frequently a
mixed commission has been created, composed of nominees of
the respective States in dispute and of an additional member
selected in some other way. The nominees of a State are
usually its own nationals; sometimes they are treated as
representing it and being under its control---a practice which
is in many ways objectionable.

Disputes submitted to arbitration are of the most varied
character. Arbitral tribunals have dealt with disputes primarily
involving legal issues as well as disputes turning on questions
of fact and requiring some appreciation of the merits of the
controversy. As a rule such tribunals have not declined to
deal with a matter either on the ground that no recognised
legal rules were applicable[^456/2] or on the ground that political
aspects were involved. For this reason the distinction
frequently drawn by writers on international law between
"justiciable" and "non-justiciable" disputes is a little difficult
to understand and does not appear to have much practical
value.[^457/1] Inasmuch, however, as by special clauses in their
arbitration treaties, States often exclude from arbitration
disputes affecting their "vital interests", or concerning only
matters of "domestic jurisdiction", such reserved disputes
may in a sense be "non-justiciable", and open only to the
procedure of conciliation. An illustration is the clause in the
Anglo-French Arbitration Treaty of 1903 whereby the two
States bound themselves not to arbitrate disputes which
"affect the vital interests, the independence, or the honour" of
the parties. A more intelligible distinction is that between
legal and non-legal disputes (_see_, e.g., Article 36 of the United
Nations Charter).

There will always be a place for arbitration in the relations
between States. Arbitral procedure is more appropriate than
judicial settlement for technical disputes, and less expensive,
while, if necessary, arbitrations can be conducted without
publicity, even to the extent that parties can agree that awards
be not published. Moreover, the general principles governing
the practice and powers of arbitral tribunals are fairly well
recognised.[^457/2] Lastly, arbitral procedure is flexible enough to
be combined with the fact-finding processes which are availed
of in the case of negotiation, good offices, mediation, conciliation,
and inquiry.[^458/1]

#### (b) Judicial Settlement

By judicial settlement is meant a settlement brought about
by a properly constituted international judicial tribunal,
applying rules of law.

The only general organ[^458/2] of judicial settlement at present
available in the international community is the International
Court of Justice[^458/3] at The Hague, which succeeded to and
preserves continuity with the Permanent Court of International
Justice. The essential difference between the Court, on the one
hand, and an arbitral tribunal, on the other hand, can be seen by
reference to the following points :---

(1) The Court is a permanently
constituted tribunal, governed by a Statute and its
own body of rules of procedure, binding on all parties having
recourse to the Court.

(2) It possesses a permanent registry,
performing all the necessary functions of receiving documents
for filing, recording, and authentication, general Court services,
and acting as a channel of communication with Government and
other bodies.

(3) Proceedings are public, while in due course
the pleadings, and records of the hearings and judgments are
published.

(4) In principle, the Court is accessible to all
States for the judicial settlement of all cases which States may be
able to refer to it, and of all matters specially provided for in
treaties and Conventions in force. (5) Article 38[^459/1] of its Statute
specifically sets out the different forms of law which the Court is
to apply in cases and matters brought before it, without
prejudice to the power of the Court to decide a case ex aequo
et bono if the parties agree to that course. (6) The membership
of the Court is representative of the greater part of the international
community, and of the principal legal systems, to an
extent that is not the case with any other tribunal. (7) In the
result, it is possible for the Court to develop a consistent practice
in its proceedings, and to maintain a certain continuity of
outlook to a degree that is not feasible with _ad hoc_ tribunals.

The International Court of Justice was established pursuant
to Chapter XIV (Articles 92--96) of the United Nations Charter
drawn up at San Francisco in 1945. Article 92 of the Charter
declares that the Court is "the principal organ of the United
Nations", and provides that the Court is to function in accordance
with a Statute, forming "an integral part" of the
Charter. By contrast, the Court's predecessor, the Permanent
Court of International Justice, was not an organ of the League
of Nations, although in some measure linked to the League.
Inasmuch as the International Court of Justice is firmly
anchored in the system of the United Nations, member States
are just as much bound to the Court as to any other principal
organ of the United Nations, while reciprocal duties of cooperation
with each other bind the Court and United Nations
organs. Also the Court is bound by the Purposes and Principles
of the United Nations as these are expressed in Articles 1 and 2
of the Charter, and because the Court's Statute is annexed to
the Charter and is an integral part of it, the context of the
Charter is a controlling factor in the interpretation of the
provisions of the Statute.

The Statute contains the basic rules concerning the constitution,
jurisdiction, and procedure of the Court, and is
supplemented by two sets of rules adopted by the Court
pursuant to its rule-framing powers under Article 30 of the
Statute :---

(a) The Rules of Court adopted on May 6, 1946, and
based on the corresponding Rules of the Permanent Court of
1936. These contain not only rules of procedure, but also rules
governing the working of the Court and of the Registry.

(b) The Resolution of July 3, 1968 concerning the Court's
internal judicial practice. This sets out the practice to be
followed by the Court in respect to exchanges of views between
the judges regarding particular points, after the termination of
the written proceedings, and before the commencement of the
oral hearing, and in respect to the Court's deliberations in
private after the conclusion of the oral hearing, with a view to
reaching its decision, and the preparation of the judgment.
Since 1967, the Rules of Court have been undergoing a process
of revision with the object of bringing these more in line with
modern conditions, and in order to simplify procedure.

It can be seen that procedural rules are to be found both in
the Statute and in the Rules of Court. Broadly speaking, the
difference in nature between the content of the two instruments
is that the Statute is basically more important for the Court
itself, while the Rules of Court are basically more important
for the parties appearing before the Court. Moreover, the
Statute is of higher legal sanctity than the Rules of Court;
being part of the Charter, it cannot, unlike the Rules of Court,
be amended directly by the Judges themselves.[^460/1]

All Members of the United Nations are _ipso facto_ parties to
the Statute, but other States may become parties to it, on
conditions to be laid down in each case by the United Nations
General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security
Council (Article 93 of the Charter). The conditions laid down
in this connection have, up to the present, been the same for
each case, namely, acceptance of the provisions of the Statute,
acceptance of the obligations under Article 94[^460/2] of the United
Nations Charter, and an undertaking to contribute to the
expenses of the Court, and were contained in the General
Assembly's Resolution of December 11, 1946.

The Court consists of fifteen Judges. Candidates for
membership of the Court are nominated by the national groups
of the panel of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.[^461/1] From
this list of nominees, the General Assembly and Security
Council, voting independently, elect the members of the
Court, an absolute majority in both the Assembly and the
Council being required for election.[^461/2] Not only are the highest
legal qualifications requisite under the Statute for election to
the Court but also appointments are made with due regard to
ensuring that the Judges elected represent "the main forms
of civilisation" and the "... principal legal systems of the
world" (Article 9 of the Statute). The first elections were
held in 1946.

### Jurisdiction of International Court of Justice

The Court is open :---

(a) to the States (Members or Non-Members
of the United Nations) parties to the Statute; and

(b) to other States on conditions to be laid down by the United
Nations Security Council, subject to the special provisions
contained in treaties in force, and such conditions are not to
place the parties in a position of inequality before the Court
(Article 35 of the Statute).[^461/3]

The Court's jurisdiction is twofold :---

(a) to decide contentious
cases;

(b) to give advisory opinions. Both functions
are judicial functions.

### Contentious Jurisdiction

In contentious cases, in principle, the exercise of the Court's
jurisdiction is conditional on the consent of the parties to the
dispute. Under Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Statute, the
Court has jurisdiction over all cases which the parties refer to
it; such reference would normally be made by the notification
of a special agreement known as a compromis. The provision
in Article 36, paragraph 1, is not to be taken as meaning that
the Court has jurisdiction only if the proceedings are initiated
through a joint reference of the dispute by the contesting
parties. A unilateral reference of a dispute to the Court by
one party, without a prior special agreement, will be sufficient
if the other party or parties to the dispute consent to the
reference, then or subsequently. It is enough if there is a voluntary
submission to jurisdiction (i.e., the principle of forum
prorogatum), and such assent is not required to be given before
the proceedings are instituted, or to be expressed in any particular
form.[^462/1] If, however, there is no consent, and no submission
by the other party to the dispute, the case must be
removed from the Court's list.[^462/2] Nor can the Court decide on the
merits of a case in the absence of a materially interested State.[^462/3]

Only States may be parties in cases before the Court, but the
Court is empowered to obtain or request information from
public international organisations relevant to these cases, or
such organisations may furnish this information on their own
initiative (_see_ Article 34 of the Court's Statute). Moreover,
the Court has been given jurisdiction under the Statutes of the
Administrative Tribunals[^462/4] of the United Nations and of the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) to determine by
advisory opinion whether judgments of these tribunals have
been vitiated by fundamental errors in procedure, etc., and in
that connection upon requests for an advisory opinion by the
international organisations concerned, may take into account
written observations and information forwarded on behalf of
individuals, i.e. the officials as to whom the judgments have
been given.[^463/1] Should individuals apply to the Court with the
object of obtaining a decision on questions at issue between
them and their own or other Governments, the practice is for the
Registrar of the Court to inform such applicants that under
Article 34 of the Statute only States may be parties in cases
before the Court; while if entities other than individuals seek to
bring proceedings, the Registrar may refer the matter to the
Court in private meeting, if he be uncertain as to the status of the
complainant entity.[^463/2]

The Court has compulsory jurisdiction where :---

(1) The parties concerned are bound by treaties or Conventions
in which they have agreed that the Court should have
jurisdiction over certain categories of disputes. Among the
instruments providing for reference of questions or disputes to
the Court are numerous bilateral Air Services Agreements,
Treaties of Commerce and Economic Co-operation, Consular
Conventions, the Peace Treaty with Japan signed at San Francisco
on September 8, 1951 (_see_ Article 22), and the European Convention
for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes concluded at
Strasbourg on April 29, 1957.[^463/3] To preserve continuity with the
work of the Permanent Court of International Justice, the Statute
further stipulates (_see_ Article 37) that whenever a treaty or convention
in force provides for reference of a matter to the
Permanent Court, the matter is to be referred to the International
Court of Justice.

(2) The parties concerned are bound by declarations made
under the so-called "Optional Clause"---paragraph 2 of
Article 36 of the Statute. This clause appeared in the former
Statute, in substantially the same terms as in the present
Statute. It now provides that the parties to the Statute
may at any time declare that they recognise as compulsory
_ipso facto_ and without special agreement "in relation to any
other State accepting the same obligation", the jurisdiction of
the Court in all legal disputes concerning :---

(a) the interpretation of a treaty;

(b) any question of international law;

(c) the existence of any fact which, if established, would
constitute a breach of an international obligation;

(d) the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for
the breach of an international obligation.
These declarations may be made :---

(i) unconditionally; or

(ii) on condition of reciprocity on the part of several or
certain States; or

(iii) for a certain time only. According
as such declarations are made, and providing that the dispute
is of a legal character and that it falls within the categories
specified, the Court's jurisdiction becomes compulsory.

The
Court is empowered to decide whether a particular dispute is or
is not one of the kind mentioned in the "Optional Clause".[^464/1]

To preserve continuity, as before, with the Permanent Court,
Article 36 paragraph 5 of the Statute provides that declarations
made under the "Optional Clause" in the earlier Statute are
deemed, as between parties to the Statute, to be acceptances of
the compulsory jurisdiction of the present Court for the period
which they still have to run, and in accordance with their
terms. This provision has been the subject of interpretation
by the present Court. According to its decision in the Case
Concerning the Aerial Incident of July 27, 1955 (Preliminary
Objections)[^465/1] such former declarations are only transferable if
made by States parties to the present Statute who were represented
at the San Francisco Conference which drew up that
Statute,[^465/2] and a former declaration made by any other State
party to the Statute lapsed in 1946 when the Permanent Court
of International Justice ceased to exist, and on that account.
However, under the Court's decision in the Preah Vihear
Temple Case (Preliminary Objections)[^465/3] a declaration made
after 1946 by any such other State, purporting to renew a
declaration under the "Optional Clause" in the earlier Statute,
is none the less valid as a declaration under the present Statute,
because owing to the dissolution of the Permanent Court, it
could have no application except in relation to the present
Court.

At the San Francisco Conference, some delegations had
urged that the Statute should provide for some compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court over legal disputes, but others
hoped that this result could be practically obtained through
more widespread acceptance of the "Optional Clause". This
expectation has not been fulfilled to date.

The majority of the present declarations in force[^465/4] are subject
to a condition of reciprocity. Many of them also include
reservations, excluding certain kinds of disputes from compulsory
jurisdiction. The reservations as to jurisdiction are
to some extent standardised, covering _inter alia_ the exclusion
of :---

(i) past disputes, or disputes relating to prior sitụations
or facts;

(ii) disputes for which other methods of settlement are
available;

(iii) disputes as to questions within the domestic
or national jurisdiction of the declaring State;

(iv) disputes
arising out of war or hostilities; and

(v) disputes between
member States of the British Commonwealth.

Too many of
the reservations are, however, merely escape clauses or consciously
designed loopholes. Such a system of "optional"
compulsory jurisdiction verges on absurdity.

A case of a specially contentious reservation is the so-called
"automatic" or "self-judging" form of reservation contained
in proviso (b) to the American declaration of August 14, 1946,
reserving "disputes with regard to matters essentially within
the domestic jurisdiction of the United States of America as
determined by the United States of America". The validity
of this reservation, more generally known as the "Connally
amendment", has been questioned.[^466/1]

A number of points affecting the operation of the "Optional
Clause" have been settled by decisions of the present Court :---

(a) Where a declaration, subject to a condition of reciprocity,
has been made by a State, and another State seeks to invoke
compulsory jurisdiction against it, the respondent State is
entitled to resist the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court by
taking advantage of any wider reservations, including the
"automatic" or "self-judging" form of reservation, made by
the claimant State in its declaration.[^466/2] Jurisdiction is conferred
upon the Court only to the extent to which the two declarations
coincide at their narrowest. But this bilateral effect does not
apply in favour of a respondent State except on the basis of
wider reservations actually contained in the claimant State's
declaration; the fact that the claimant State would, if proceedings
had been taken in the Court against it by the respondent
State, have been entitled to resist jurisdiction, on the ground of
a wide reservation in the respondent State's declaration, is not
sufficient to bring into play the bilateral principle.[^466/3]

(b) If
a dispute between States relates to matters exclusively within
the domestic jurisdiction of the respondent State, it is not
within the category of "legal disputes" referred to in Article
36 paragraph 2.[^467/1]

(c) A declaration made almost immediately
before and for the purpose of an application to the Court is not
invalid, nor an abuse of the process of the Court.[^467/2]

(d) If a
matter has properly come before the Court under Article 36
paragraph 2, the Court's jurisdiction is not divested by the
unilateral act of the respondent State in terminating its declaration
in whole or in part.[^467/3]

Before the decision of the International Court of Justice in
the Corfu Channel Case (Preliminary Objection),[^467/4] it was
thought that a third category of compulsory jurisdiction
existed, namely where under Article 36 of the United Nations
Charter, the Security Council recommended the parties to a
dispute to refer their case to the Court, particularly as in
paragraph 3 of that Article the Council is virtually enjoined,
where the dispute is of a legal character to recommend submission
to the Court. In the International Court's decision,
however, seven Judges expressed the view that this Article did
not create a new class of compulsory jurisdiction, and the same
interpretation apparently applies to a decision of the Security
Council under Article 33 "calling upon" the parties to adjust
their differences by judicial settlement.

Where the Court has compulsory jurisdiction, the normal
method of initiating proceedings is by a unilateral written
application addressed to the Registrar, indicating the subject
of the dispute, and the other party or parties. The Registrar
thereupon communicates the application to the other party or
parties, and notifies all members of the United Nations and
any other States entitled to appear before the Court (Article
40 of the Statute).

The effect of the exercise of compulsory jurisdiction by the
Court is clarified by the provisions of Article 94 of the United
Nations Charter. Under this Article, each Member of the
United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision of the
Court in any case to which it is a party. Further, if any party
to a case fails to perform the obligations incumbent upon it
under a judgment rendered by the Court, the other party may
have recourse to the Security Council which may make recommendations
or decide upon measures to be taken to give effect
to the judgment, and these may be dictated by considerations
unlike those which condition processes of execution in domestic
legal systems. There are no provisions whereby the Court
may enforce its decisions, and this of course represents a
serious weakness.

The procedure in contentious cases is partly written, partly
oral. The written proceedings of the Court consist of communicating
to it memorials, counter-memorials, replies and
rejoinders, and papers and documents in support. The oral
proceedings consist of the hearing by the Court of witnesses,
and experts, and of agents, counsel, or advocates who may
represent the States concerned. The hearings are public unless
the Court decides otherwise or the parties demand that the
public be not admitted. The South West Africa Cases confirmed
that claimants in the same interest may be joined
together, that the parties can call witnesses or experts to testify
personally, and that the Court itself may put questions to the
parties and witnesses, but that the Court has some area of
discretion in deciding whether to accede to a request for a
view or inspection in loco (_semble_, also if the view is requested
by consent of all parties).

The Court may indicate under Article 41 of its Statute any
interim measures necessary to preserve the respective rights of
the parties, notice of which has to be given forthwith to the
parties and to the Security Council.[^468/1]

Preliminary objections may be taken, e.g. to the jurisdiction
of the Court, or by way of a plea that the matter belongs to the
exclusive domestic jurisdiction of the respondent State,[^469/1] or
that the stage of a dispute between the parties has not arisen.[^469/2]
Where the preliminary objections raise matters which require
fuller investigation, or which are wrapped up with the issues
and evidence that may be tendered thereon, the Court will not
decide upon them in the first instance, but will join them to the
merits of the case.[^469/3] It was the Court's majority view in the
South West Africa Cases, Second Phase (1966)[^469/4] that a decision
on a preliminary objection, even of a somewhat like point,
can never bind the Court where the question resolves itself into
one founded on the merits, after all arguments have been presented.

All questions are decided by a majority of the Judges present;
and if the voting is equal, the President has a casting vote. The
legal effect of the Court's judgment is set out in Articles 59--61.
The Court's decision has no binding force except between the
parties and in respect of the particular case (Article 59). The
judgment is "final and without appeal" (Article 60) but a
revision may be applied for on the ground of the discovery of a
new "decisive factor", provided that application is made within
six months of such discovery and not later than ten years from
the date of the judgment (Article 61). Unless otherwise
decided by the Court, each party bears its own costs.

According to recent judgments of the Court, there are
_semble_ some essential limitations on the exercise of its judicial
functions in the contentious jurisdiction, and on the rights of
States to advance a claim in that jurisdiction.

First, as the Northern Cameroons Case shows,[^470/1] an adjudication
by the Court must deal concretely with an actual controversy
involving a conflict of legal rights or interests as
between the parties; it is not for the Court to give abstract
rulings, _inter partes_, to provide some basis for political decisions,
if its findings do not bear upon actual legal relationships.
Otherwise, it might be acting virtually as a "moot Court".
The correlative aspect is that the parties cannot be treated as
mutually aggrieved to the extent of a "dispute" if there is a
mere difference of opinion between them, in the absence of a
concrete disagreement over matters substantively affecting
their legal rights or interests.

Second, and more controversially, the Court decided by a
majority in the South West Africa Cases, Second Phase[^470/2] that
the claimant States, Ethiopia and Liberia, had failed to establish
a legal right or interest appertaining to them in the subject-matter
of their claims which, therefore, should be rejected.
This question was treated as one of an antecedent character,
but nevertheless bearing upon the merits.

### Advisory Opinions

As to advisory opinions, the General Assembly and the
Security Council of the United Nations Organisation may
request such opinions from the Court. Other organs of the
United Nations and the "specialised agencies" may, if
authorised by the General Assembly, request the Court to
give advisory opinions on legal questions arising within the
scope of their activities.[^470/3] Advisory opinions can only be
sought on legal questions, concrete or abstract, and in giving
them the Court would of course be exercising a judicial function.
An advisory opinion is no more than it purports to be;
it lacks the binding force of a judgment in contentious cases,
even for the organisation or organ which has requested it,
although of course such organisation or organ may choose to
treat it as of the nature of a compulsory ruling. Nor does the
Court have powers of judicial review or of appeal in respect to
any decisions of such organisation or organ, for example by
way of setting these aside, although it may incidentally in the
course of an advisory opinion pronounce upon the question of
the validity of a particular decision.[^471/1] So far as States are
concerned, they may by treaty or agreement undertake in
advance to be bound by advisory opinions on certain questions
(_see_, for example, Section 30 of the Convention on the
Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, 1946, and
Section 32 of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities
of the Specialised Agencies, 1947). Also, in the absence of any
such provisions, advisory opinions will have strong persuasive
authority.

The procedure in the case of advisory opinions is that a
written request must be laid before the Court containing an
exact statement of the question on which an opinion is sought,
and accompanied by all documents likely to throw light on the
question. This is a formal and indispensable requirement for
the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court to give an advisory
opinion. The Registrar then notifies all States entitled to
appear before the Court. He also notifies any State or international
organisation, thought likely to be able to furnish
information on the subject, that the Court will receive written
or oral statements. States and international organisations
presenting written or oral statements may comment on those
made by other States and organisations. The advisory opinion
is delivered in open Court (_see_ Article 67 of the Statute). Both
under Article 68 of the Statute and in practice the Court's
procedure has been closely assimilated to the procedure in the
contentious jurisdiction.

The Court also regards itself as under a duty to observe
essential judicial limitations in its advisory opinion procedure,
so that it will not exercise the jurisdiction if the main point on
which an opinion is requested is decisive of a controversy
between certain States, and any one of these States is not before
the Court.[^472/1] For to give an advisory opinion in such circumstances
would be to adjudicate without the consent of one
party. The interpretation of treaty provisions is essentially
a judicial task, and the Court will not reject a request for an
opinion on such a question, although it be claimed that such
question and such request are of a political nature.[^472/2] In any
event, the Court will not decline to give an advisory opinion,
because it is maintained that in respect to such opinion the
Court had been, or might be subjected to political pressure.[^472/3]

The Court has, _semble_, also a discretion to refuse to give an
advisory opinion upon other grounds, for example, that the
question submitted involves other than legal aspects, or is
embarrassing. The Court has held, however, that the circumstance
that the Executive Board of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) was
alone entitled to seek an advisory opinion as to whether a
decision of the Administrative Tribunal of the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) upon a staff claim was vitiated by
a fundamental error in procedure, etc., and that no equivalent
right of challenge was given to complainant officials, was not,
because of such inequality, a reason for not complying with
a request for an advisory opinion on such a question.[^473/1]

As we have already seen above,[^473/2] the Court applies international
law, but Article 38 of its Statute expressly enables it
to decide a case ex aequo et bono if the parties concerned agree
to this course. This means that the Court can give a decision
on objective grounds of fairness and justice without being
bound exclusively by rules of law. The Court will adopt this
course only if so directed by the parties in the most explicit
terms.[^473/3] Presumably the Court could not be required to
undertake, ex aequo et bono, functions which were strictly
speaking of a legislative character. This consensual ex aequo
et bono jurisdiction must, however, be distinguished from the
Court's inherent power, as a Court of justice, to apply equitable
principles.[^473/4]

There are other points of importance concerning the Court.
Nine Judges form a quorum. If the parties so request, the
Court may sit in Chambers. Chambers of three or more
Judges may be formed for dealing with particular categories of
cases, for example, labour cases and cases relating to transit and
communications, and annually a Chamber of five Judges is
formed to hear and determine cases by summary procedure.
The principle of national Judges applies under the present
Statute (Article 31). Judges of the nationality of parties
before the Court retain their right to sit in the case; if the Court
includes a Judge of the nationality of one party, any other
party may choose a person to sit as Judge, and if the Court does
not include Judges of the nationality of the parties, each of the
parties may proceed to appoint as Judge a person of its
nationality.

It must be admitted that although both the Permanent Court
of International Justice, and the International Court of Justice
disposed of a substantial number of contentious matters and
of requests for an advisory opinion, States generally showed
marked reluctance to bring before these Courts matters of
vital concern, or to accept compulsory adjudication in such
matters. It is significant, also, that States have been unwilling
to avail themselves of the clauses in the very large number of
bilateral and multilateral treaties,[^474/1] providing for reference of
disputes to the former, or to the present Court.

Pessimism, on this account, as to the limited scope of judicial
settlement in the international community, is to some extent
mitigated by the fact that both Courts adjudicated many
questions raising important points of law, or difficult problems
of treaty interpretation. Some of these judgments or opinions
arose out of important political disputes which came before
the League of Nations Council, or before the United Nations
Security Council; e.g. the Permanent Court's Advisory
Opinions on the Frontier between Turkey and Iraq,[^474/2] on the
Customs Régime between Germany and Austria,[^474/3] and on the
Nationality Decrees in Tunis and Morocco,[^474/4] and the International
Court's judgment in the Corfu Channel Case (Merits).[^474/5]
Nor can it be denied that both Courts made substantial contributions
to the development and methodology of international
law.[^475/1] So far as the present Court is concerned, reference need
only be made to the Advisory Opinions on Conditions of
Membership in the United Nations[^475/2] and on Reparation for
Injuries Suffered in the Service of the United Nations,[^475/3] and to the
judgments in the Fisheries Case,[^475/4] the Nottebohm Case (Second
Phase),[^475/5] and the Minquiers and Ecrehos Case,[^475/6] and other cases
referred to, in their appropriate place, in the present book.
The role permitted to international adjudication may be a
modest one, but it is at present indispensable, particularly for
clarifying on the judicial level those issues which can be resolved
according to international law.

Then there should be mentioned the possibility, as illustrated
in the Case Concerning the Arbitral Award of the King of Spain,[^475/7]
of using the International Court of Justice for the judicial
review or revision of international arbitral awards on the
ground that the arbitral tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction, committed
a fundamental error in procedure, etc. The International
Law Commission favoured general recourse to the Court for
this purpose.[^475/8] At present, however, any such challenge to an
arbitral award is only possible by special agreement between
the parties, or if the matter can be brought under the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court.

Finally not to be overlooked is the key role which the
President of the Court plays in so far as he is called upon to
appoint arbitrators, umpires, and members of Commissions[^475/9]---
to this extent, he performs indispensable services in the field of
peaceful settlement of disputes.

#### (c) Negotiation, good offices, mediation, conciliation, or inquiry

Negotiation, good offices, mediation, conciliation, and
inquiry are methods of settlement less formal than either
judicial settlement or arbitration.

Little need be said concerning negotiation except that it
frequently proceeds in conjunction with good offices or
mediation, although reference should be made to the recent
trend of providing, by international instrument or arrangement,
legal frameworks for two processes of consultation and
communication, without which in some circumstances negotiation
cannot proceed. Illustrations of the former are the
provisions for consultation in the Australia-New Zealand Free
Trade Agreement of August 31, 1965, and of the latter, the
United States-Soviet Memorandum of Understanding, Geneva,
June 20, 1963 for a direct communication link-the so-called
"hot line"---between Washington and Moscow in case of crisis.

Both good offices and mediation are methods of settlement in
which, usually, a friendly third State assists in bringing about
an amicable solution of the dispute.[^476/1] But the party tendering
good offices or mediating may also, in certain cases, be an
individual or an international organ (_cf._ the tender of good
offices by the United Nations Security Council in 1947 in the
dispute between the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia).
The distinction between good offices and mediation
is to a large extent a matter of degree. In the case of good
offices, a third party tenders its services in order to bring the
disputing parties together, and to suggest (in general terms) the
making of a settlement, without itself actually participating in
the negotiations or conducting an exhaustive inquiry into the
various aspects of the dispute. Hence, once the parties have
been brought together for the purpose of working out a solution
of their controversies, strictly speaking the State or party
tendering good offices has no further active duties to perform
(_see_ Article X of the Pact of Bogotá, i.e. the Inter-American
Treaty on Pacific Settlement of April 30, 1948). In the case
of mediation, on the other hand, the mediating party has a
more active role, and participates in the negotiations and
directs them in such a way that a peaceful solution may be
reached, although any suggestions made by it are of no binding
effect upon the parties.[^477/1] The initiative of the Soviet Government
at the end of 1965 and early in 1966 in bringing representatives
of India and Pakistan together at Tashkent to settle the
conflict between them, and in creating a propitious atmosphere,
for a settlement, seems to have lain somewhere between good
offices and mediation.

The scope of both good offices and mediation is limited;
there is a lack of any procedure in both methods for conducting
a thorough investigation into the facts or the law. Hence, in
the future, the greatest possibilities for both methods lie as
steps preliminary or ancillary to the more specialised techniques
of conciliation, of inquiry, and of settlement through the
United Nations.

The term "conciliation" has both a broad and a narrow
meaning. In its more general sense, it covers the great variety
of methods whereby a dispute is amicably settled with the aid
of other States or of impartial bodies of inquiry or advisory
committees. In the narrow sense, "conciliation" signifies
the reference of a dispute to a commission or committee to
make a report with proposals to the parties for settlement,
such proposals not being of a binding character. According
to Judge Manly O. Hudson[^477/2] :---

> Conciliation ... is a process of formulating proposals of
settlement after an investigation of the facts and an effort to
reconcile opposing contentions, the parties to the dispute being
left free to accept or reject the proposals formulated .

The fact that the parties are perfectly free to decide whether
or not to adopt the proposed terms of settlement distinguishes
conciliation from arbitration.

Conciliation Commissions were provided for in the Hague
Conventions of 1899 and 1907 for the Pacific Settlement of
International Disputes (_see_ repectively Title III and Part III
of these Conventions). Such Commissions could be set up by
special agreement between the parties, and were to investigate
and report on situations of fact with the proviso that the report
in no way bound the parties to the dispute. The actual
provisions in the Conventions avoid any words suggesting compulsion
on the parties to accept a Commission's report. Similar
commissions were also set up under a series of treaties negotiated
by the United States in 1913 and the following years,
known as the "Bryan Treaties". More recent treaties providing
for conciliation are the Brussels Treaty of March 17, 1948,
and the Pact of Bogotá, p. 476, _ante_.

The value of Conciliation Commissions as such has been
doubted by several authorities, but the procedure of conciliation
itself proved most useful and important when employed by the
League of Nations Council to settle international disputes.
The Council's use of conciliation was extremely flexible;
generally a small committee, or a person known as a rapporteur,[^478/1]
was appointed to make tactful investigations and suggest
a method of composing the differences between the parties.[^478/2]
States do attach great value to the procedure of conciliation, as
reflected in the provision made for it in the Convention of
March 18, 1965, on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of other States.

The object of an inquiry is, without making specific recommendations,
to establish the facts, which may be in dispute,
and thereby prepare the way for a negotiated adjustment.[^479/1]
Thus, frequently, in cases of disputed boundaries, a commission
may be appointed to inquire into the historical and
geographical facts which are subject of controversy and thus
clarify the issues for a boundary agreement. Also, sometimes
an expert committee is necessary to inquire into certain special
facts for the purposes of preliminary elucidation.

Obviously one or more of the above methods---negotiation,
good offices, mediation, conciliation, and inquiry---may be
used in combination with the other or others.

Recently there have been fresh moves to improve processes
of settlement, and render them even more flexible. The
proposals have included the extension of fact-finding methods,
and the creation of a fact-finding organ, or fact-finding centre.[^479/2]
On December 18, 1967, the United Nations General Assembly
adopted a Resolution, upholding the usefulness of the method of
impartial fact-finding as a mode of peaceful settlement, and in
which it urged Member States to make more effective use of
fact-finding methods, and requested the Secretary-General to
prepare a register of experts whose services could be used by
agreement for fact-finding in relation to a dispute. Subsequently,
in accordance with the Resolution, nominations of
experts were received for the purposes of the register (_see_ Note
by Secretary-General, Document A/7240). Existing facilities
for fact-finding include also those provided by the Panel for
Inquiry and Conciliation set up by the General Assembly in
April, 1949.

Even wider initiatives have been supported by the United
Kingdom and the United States in the General Assembly.
If these result in more effective processes, the suggestions are
to be welcomed, but it is always to be remembered that further
multiplication of organs may derogate from the value and
significance of those which now exist.

#### (d) Settlement under Auspices of United Nations Organisation

As successor to the League of Nations, the United Nations
Organisation, created in 1945, has taken over the bulk of the
responsibility for adjusting international disputes. One of the
fundamental objects of the Organisation is the peaceful settlement
of differences between States, and by Article 2 of the
United Nations Charter, Members of the Organisation have
undertaken to settle their disputes by peaceful means and to
refrain from threats of war or the use of force.

In this connection, important responsibilities devolve on the
General Assembly and on the Security Council, corresponding
to which wide powers are entrusted to both bodies. The
General Assembly is given authority, subject to the peace
enforcement powers of the Security Council, to recommend
measures for the peaceful adjustment of any situation which is
likely to impair general welfare or friendly relations among
nations (_see_ Article 14 of the Charter).

The more extensive powers, however, have been conferred
on the Security Council in order that it should execute swiftly
and decisively the policy of the United Nations. The Council
acts, broadly speaking, in two kinds of disputes :---

(i) disputes
which may endanger international peace and security;

(ii)
cases of threats to the peace, or breaches of peace, or acts of
aggression. In the former case, the Council, when necessary,
may call on the parties to settle their disputes by the methods
considered above, viz., arbitration, judicial settlement, negotiation,
inquiry, mediation, and conciliation.

Also the Council
may at any stage recommend appropriate procedures or
methods of adjustment for settling such disputes. In the
latter case, (ii) above, the Council is empowered to make
recommendations or decide what measures are to be taken to
maintain or restore international peace and security, and it
may call on the parties concerned to comply with certain
provisional measures. There is no restriction or qualification
on the recommendations which the Council may make, or on
the measures, final or provisional, which it may decide are
necessary. It may propose a basis of settlement, it may appoint
a commission of inquiry, it may authorise a reference to the
International Court of Justice, and so on. Under Articles
41 to 47 of the Charter, the Security Council has also the
right to give effect to its decisions not only by coercive
measures such as economic sanctions, but also by the use of
armed force as against States which decline to be bound by
these decisions.[^481/1]

With the exception of disputes of an exclusively legal
character which are usually submitted to arbitration or judicial
settlement, it is purely a matter of policy or expediency which
of the above different methods is to be adopted for composing
a particular difference between States. Certain treaties have
endeavoured to define the kind of dispute which should be
submitted to arbitration, judicial settlement, or conciliation,
or the order in which recourse should be had to these methods,
but experience has shown the dubious value of any such preestablished
definitions or procedure. Any one method may
be appropriate, and the greater the flexibility permitted, the
more chance there is of an amicable solution.

The General Act for the Pacific Settlement of International
Disputes adopted by the League of Nations Assembly in
1928 was a type of instrument in which a maximum of flexibility
and freedom of choice was sought to be achieved.[^481/2] It
provided separate procedures, a procedure of conciliation
(before Conciliation Commissions) for all disputes (Chapter I),
a procedure of judicial settlement or arbitration for disputes
of a legal character (Chapter II), and a procedure of arbitration
for other disputes (Chapter III). States could accede to the
General Act by accepting all or some of the procedures and
were also allowed to make certain defined reservations (for
example, as to prior disputes, as to questions within the
domestic jurisdiction, etc.). The General Act was acceded to
by twenty-three States, only two of whom acceded to part of
the instrument, but unfortunately the accessions to the General
Act as a whole were made subject to material reservations.
As a result, the practical influence of the instrument was
negligible, and it was not invoked in any case before the
Permanent Court of International Justice. A Revised General
Act was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on
April 28, 1949, but it has not been acceded to by as many
States as expected.

In this connection, there should be mentioned the problem
of peaceful change or revision of treaties and the status quo
which troubled publicists a good deal just before the Second
World War. Many claimed that none of the above methods
was suitable for settling "revisionist" disputes, and proposed
the creation of an International Equity Tribunal which would
adjudicate claims for peaceful change on a basis of fairness
and justice. The powers which would have been conferred
on such a tribunal appear now to be vested, although not in a
very specific or concrete manner, in the United Nations.[^482/1]

## FORCIBLE OR COERCIVE MEANS OF SETTLEMENT

When States cannot agree to solve their disputes amicably
a solution may have to be found and imposed by forcible
means. The principal forcible modes of settlement are :---

(a) War and non-war armed action.

(b) Retorsion,

(c) Reprisals.

(d) Pacific blockade.

(e) Intervention.

#### (a) War and Non-War Armed Action

The whole purpose of war is to overwhelm the opponent
State, and to impose terms of settlement which that State has
no alternative but to obey. Armed action, which falls short
of a state of war, has also been resorted to in recent years.
War and non-war armed hostilities are discussed in detail in
Chapter 17, below.

#### (b) Retorsion

Retorsion is the technical term for retaliation by a State
against discourteous or inequitable acts of another State, such
retaliation taking the form of unfriendly legitimate acts within
the competence of the State whose dignity has been affronted;
for example, severance of diplomatic relations, revocation of
dipiomatic privileges, or withdrawal of fiscal or tariff
concessions.

So greatly has the practice as to retorsion varied that it is
impossible to define precisely the conditions under which it is
justified. At all events it need not be a retaliation in kind.
The legitimate use of retorsion by Member States of the
United Nations has probably been affected by one or two
provisions in the United Nations Charter. For example, under
paragraph 3 of Article 2, Member States are to settle their
disputes by peaceful means in such a way as not to "endanger"
international peace and security, and justice. It is possible
that an otherwise legitimate act of retorsion may in certain
circumstances be such as to endanger international peace and
security, and justice, in which event it would seemingly be
illegal under the Charter.

#### (c) Reprisals

Reprisals are methods adopted by States for securing redress
from another State by taking retaliatory measures. Formerly,
the term was restricted to the seizure of property or persons,
but in its modern acceptation connotes coercive measures
adopted by one State against another for the purpose of
settling some dispute brought about by the latter's illegal or
unjustified conduct. The distinction between reprisals and
retorsion is that reprisals consist of acts which would generally
otherwise be quite illegal whereas retorsion consists of retaliatory
conduct to which no legal objection can be taken. Reprisals
may assume various forms, for example, a boycott of the goods
of a particular State,[^484/1] an embargo, a naval demonstration,[^484/2] or
bombardment.

It is now generally established by international practice
that a reprisal is only justified if the State against which it is
directed has been guilty of conduct in the nature of an international
delinquency. Moreover, a reprisal would not be
justified if the delinquent State had not been previously
requested to give satisfaction for the wrong done, or if the
measures of reprisal were "excessive" in relation to the injury
suffered.[^484/3] There have been several vivid illustrations of
purported reprisal action by States, for example the expulsion
of Hungarians from Yugoslavia in 1935, in alleged retaliation
for Hungarian responsibility for the murder of King Alexander
of Yugoslavia at Marseilles, and the shelling of the Spanish
port of Almeria by German warships in 1937, as reprisal
for an alleged bombardment of the battleship Deutschland by a
Spanish aircraft belonging to the Spanish Republican forces.

Some authorities hold that reprisals are only justified if
their purpose is to bring about a satisfactory settlement of a
dispute. Hence the principle referred to above that reprisals
should not be resorted to unless and until negotiations for the
purpose of securing redress from the delinquent State fail.

Strictly speaking, retaliatory acts between belligerent States
in the course of a war are a different matter altogether from
reprisals, although they also are termed "reprisals". The
object of such acts is generally to force an opponent State
to stop breaking the laws of war; as, for example, in 1939--1940,
when Great Britain commenced the seizure of German exports
on neutral vessels in retaliation for the unlawful sinking of
merchant ships by German-sown naval magnetic mines.

As in the case of retorsion, the use of reprisals by Member
States of the United Nations has been affected by the Charter.
Not only is there paragraph 3 of Article 2 mentioned above in
connection with retorsion, but there is also the provision in
paragraph 4 of the same Article that Member States are to
refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial
integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other
manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.
A reprisal, therefore, which consisted in the threat or the
exercise of military force against another State in such a way
as to prejudice its territorial integrity, or political independence,
would presumably be illegal. Moreover under Article 33 the
States parties to a dispute, the continuance of which is likely to
endanger peace and security are "first of all" to seek a solution
by negotiation, and other peaceful means. Thus a resort to
force by way of retaliation would seemingly be excluded as
illegal.

There have also been cases of international or collective
reprisals.[^485/1]

#### (d) Pacific Blockade

In time of war, the blockade of a belligerent State's ports
is a very common naval operation. The pacific blockade,
however, is a measure employed in time of peace. Sometimes
classed as a reprisal, it is generally designed to coerce the
State whose ports are blockaded into complying with a request
for satisfaction by the blockading States. Some authorities
have doubted its legality. If not now obsolete, its admissibility
as a unilateral measure is questionable, in the light of the
United Nations Charter.

The pacific blockade appears to have been first employed
in 1827; since that date there have been about twenty instances
of its employment. It was generally used by very powerful
States, with naval forces, against weak States. Although for
that reason liable to abuse, in the majority of cases it was
employed by the Great Powers acting in concert for objects
which were perhaps in the best interests of all concerned, for
example, to end some disturbance, or to ensure the proper
execution of treaties, or to prevent the outbreak of war, as in
the case of the blockade of Greece in 1886 to secure the disarming
of the Greek troops assembled near the frontiers and
thus avoid a conflict with Turkey. From this standpoint the
pacific blockade may be regarded as a recognised collective
procedure for facilitating the settlement of differences between
States. Indeed, the blockade is expressly mentioned in
Article 42 of the United Nations Charter as one of the operations
which the Security Council may initiate in order to
"maintain or restore international peace and security".

There are certain obvious advantages in the employment of
the pacific blockade. It is a far less violent means of action
than war, and is more elastic. On the other hand, it is more
than an ordinary reprisal, and against any but the weak States
who are usually subjected to it, might be deemed an act of war.

It is perhaps a just comment on the institution of pacific
blockade that the strong maritime powers who resort to it
do so in order to avoid the burdens and inconveniences of war.
Most writers agree, and on the whole the British practice
supports the view, that a blockading State has no right to
seize ships of third States which endeavour to break a pacific
blockade.[^486/1] It follows also that third States are not duty bound
to respect such a blockade. The principle is that a blockading
State can only operate against ships of other States if it has
declared a belligerent blockade, that is, where actual war exists
between the blockading and blockaded States and accordingly
it becomes entitled to search neutral shipping. But by
instituting merely a pacific blockade, the blockading State
tacitly admits that the interests at stake were not sufficient to
warrant the burdens and risks of war. On principle, therefore,
in the absence of an actual war, the blockading State should
not impose on third States the obligations and inconveniences
of neutrality. In other words, a blockading State cannot
simultaneously claim the benefits of peace and war.

The "selective" blockade or "quarantine" of Cuba by the
United States in October, 1962, although instituted in peacetime,
cannot be fitted within the traditional pattern of the
pacific blockades of the nineteenth century. First, it was more
than a blockade of the coast of a country as such. Its express
purpose was to "interdict" the supply of certain weapons and
equipment[^487/1] to Cuba, in order to prevent the establishment or
reinforcement of missile bases in Cuban territory, but not to
preclude all entry or exit of goods to or from Cuba. Second,
vessels of countries other than Cuba, en route to Cuba, were
subject to search, and, if necessary, control by force, and could
be directed to follow prescribed routes or avoid prohibited
zones; but it was not in terms sought to render weapon-carrying
vessels or their cargoes subject to capture for breach
of the "interdiction". Third, among other grounds, the
President of the United States purported to proclaim the
blockade pursuant to a recommendation of an international
organisation, namely the Organisation of American States.[^487/2]

Assuming that such a blockade is, in all the circumstances,
permitted by the United Nations Charter, nevertheless because
of the very special geographical and other conditions, no
general conclusions can be drawn from it as a precedent. If
not permissible under the Charter, the effect of the "quarantine"
in interfering with the freedom of the high seas raised
serious issues as to its justification under customary international
law.

#### (e) Intervention

The subject of intervention has been discussed above in
Chapter 5.[^488/1]



[^451/1]: E.g., investment disputes between capital-receiving States and private
foreign investors, the settlement of which is provided for under the Convention
of March 18, 1965, for the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States (Convention applies to legal disputes
only).

[^457/1]: Writers seem generally agreed on the point, however, that a dispute in
which one of the parties is in effect demanding a change in the rules of international
law, is "non-justiciable". Other criteria of non-justiciability, which
have been relied upon, include the following :---

    (1) the dispute relates to a
    conflict of interests, as distinct from a conflict between parties as to their
    respective rights (the test of justiciability in the Locarno Treaties of 1925);

    (2) application of the rules of international law governing the dispute would
    lead to inequality or injustice;

    (3) the dispute, while justiciable in law, is not so
    in fact, because for political reasons neither of the disputant States could
    undertake to comply with an unfavourable adjudication.

[^457/2]: In 1953, the International Law Commission submitted a Draft Convention
on Arbitral Procedure, which not only codified the law of international
arbitration, but also endeavoured to overcome certain existing defects in
procedure, e.g. disagreements between States as to whether a certain dispute
was subject to arbitration, inability to establish the tribunal, failure to agree
on the terms of the compromis, powers of the arbitral tribunal, and revision of
awards. Deadlocks on the first two matters were, according to the Draft,
to be broken by recourse to the International Court of Justice. For the tex
of the Draft and commentary thereon, _see_ Report of the Commission on the
Work of its Fifth Session (1953). The General Assembly did not accede to the
Commission's view that a Convention should be concluded on the basis of the
Draft, and in 1958, the Commission adopted a set of model Draft Articles on
Arbitral Procedure, which could be used by States as they thought fit when
entering into agreements for arbitration, bilateral or multilateral, or when
submitting particular disputes to arbitration _ad hoc_ by compromis. For the
text of the model Draft Articles and commentary thereon, _see_ Report of the
Commission on the Work of its Tenth Session (1958).

[^458/1]: E.g., in the Argentina-Chile Boundary Arbitration (1965--6), the arbitral
tribunal caused a field mission to be sent to the disputed area for the purpose
of aerial photographic surveys, and mixed ground-air reconnaissance of the
territory.

[^458/2]: As distinct from a regional judicial tribunal, such as the Court of Justice
of the European Communities under the Treaties of April 18, 1951, and of
March 25, 1957.

[^458/3]: The standard authoritative treaties on the Court are S. Rosenne, The Law
and Practice of the International Court (2 vols., 1965), and M. Dubisson,
La Cour Internationale de Justice (1964).

[^459/1]: _See_ pp. 34--56, _ante_, for discussion of this article.

[^460/1]: However, under Article 70 of the Statute, the Court is entitled to propose
amendments thereto. The Court exercised this power for the first time in 1969
when it proposed amendments enabling the General Assembly, upon the
recommendation of the Court, to approve a place other than The Hague as the
seat of the Court; _see_ I.C.J. Yearbook 1969--1970, p. 113.

[^460/2]: _See below_, p. 468.

[^461/1]: _See above_, pp. 454 455.

[^461/2]: Non-Members of the United Nations, parties to the Statute of the Court,
may participate in the elections of Judges by the General Assembly in accordance
with the conditions laid down in the General Assembly Resolution of
October 8, 1948.

[^461/3]: The conditions as laid down by the Security Council in a Resolution
of October 15, 1946, were that such States should deposit with the Court's
Registrar a declaration accepting the Court's jurisdiction in accordance with
the Charter and Statute and Rules of Court, undertaking to comply in good
faith with the Court's decisions, and to accept the obligations under Article 94
of the Charter (_see below_, p. 468).

[^462/1]: Corfu Channel Case (Preliminary Objection), I.C.J. Reports (1948), pp. 15
_et seq._ Assent by conduct can scarcely be inferred where the respondent State
consistently denies that the Court has jurisdiction; _see_ Anglo-Iranian Oil
Company Case (Jurisdiction), I.C.J. Reports (1952) 93, at p. 114.

[^462/2]: E.g., the Court made such orders for removal in 1956 in respect of the
British references of disputes with Argentina and Chile concerning Antarctica,
both Argentina and Chile denying jurisdiction; _see_ I.C.J. Reports (1956) 12
and 15. There have been other instances subsequent thereto, including the
United States application in 1958 against the Soviet Union relative to the
aerial incident of September 4, 1954; _see_ I.C.J. Reports (1958), 158.

[^462/3]: _See_ Case of Monetary Gold removed from Rome in 1943, I.C.J. Reports
(1954), 19.

[^462/4]: These tribunals have jurisdiction to deal with complaints by officials of
breaches of the terms of their appointment, etc.

[^463/1]: _See_ Advisory Opinion on Judgments of the Administrative Tribunal of the
International Labour Organisation upon Complaints inade against the United
Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), I.C.J.
Reports (1956), 77.

[^463/2]: This course was followed in 1966--1967 with regard to an application
instituting proceedings, submitted by the Mohawk nation of the Grand River;
_see_ I.C.J. Yearbook, 1966--1967, p. 88.

[^463/3]: For a list of such instruments, _see_ Yearbook 1969--1970 of the International
Court of Justice, pp. 81--93.

[^464/1]: _See_ paragraph 6 of Article 36 of the Statute, providing that in the event
of a dispute as to whether the Court has jurisdiction, the matter shall be settled
by the decision of the Court.

[^465/1]: I.C.J. Reports (1959), 127. The parties were Israel and Bulgaria.

[^465/2]: There are nine such States (namely Colombia, Dominican Republic,
El Salvador, Haiti, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, and
Uruguay), who have not made new declarations, and whose declarations
under the earlier Statute apply in relation to the present Court.

[^465/3]: I.C.J. Reports (1961), 17.

[^465/4]: As at July 1, 1971, 47 declarations were in force. For the text of each of
these declarations, with the exception of Austria's declaration lodged on
May 19, 1971, _see_ Yearbook 1969--70 of the International Court of Justice,
pp. 50--80.

[^466/1]: On the ground that it is incompatible with the power of the Court under
Article 36 paragraph 6 (mentioned _supra_) of its Statute to settle disputes as to
its jurisdiction, and on the further ground that the reservation of such a
discretion is inconsistent with any proper acceptance, within the meaning of
Article 36 paragraph 2, of compulsory jurisdiction.

[^466/2]: _See_ the Norwegian Loans Case, I.C.J. Reports (1957), 9. Because of this
decision, certain States which had made "automatic" reservations, withdrew
these.

[^466/3]: _See_ the Interhandel Case (Preliminary Objections), I.C.J. Reports (1959), 6.

[^467/1]: _See_ the Right of Passage over Indian Territory Case (Preliminary Objections),
I.C.J. Reports (1957), 125 at 133--134, and Briggs, _American Journal of
International Law_ (1959), Vol. 53 at pp. 305--306.

[^467/2]: _See_ the Right of Passage Case, _supra_. This is covered by the United
Kingdom reservation, excluding a dispute in which a State has so acted, or
where it has deposited or ratified a declaration less than 12 months prior to
the filing of its application bringing the dispute before the Court.

[^467/3]: _See_ the Right of Passage Case, _supra_, n. 1.

[^467/4]: I.C.J. Reports (1948), at pp. 15 _et seq._

[^468/1]: _Semble_, such interim measures of protection may be ordered even though
it is claimed that the Court has no jurisdiction in the dispute between the
parties; _cf._ the interim order for such measures made by the Court on July 5,
1951, in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Case.

[^469/1]: An international dispute as to the applicability of treaty provisions or of
rules of customary international law, is not a matter within the domestic
jurisdiction of parties to the dispute; _see_ Interhandel Case (Preliminary Objections),
I.C.J. Reports (1959), 6.

[^469/2]: A legal dispute within the meaning of Article 36 paragraph 2 may be
sufficiently inferred from diplomatic exchanges, without the necessity that it
should have reached a stage of precise legal definition; _see_ the Right of Passage
over Indian Territory Case (Preliminary Objections), I.C.J. Reports (1957), 125.
Diplomatic exchanges can include debates in United Nations organs as part
of the normal process of diplomacy; South West Africa Cases, Preliminary
Objections, I.C.J. Reports, 1962, 319.

[^469/3]: _See_ the Right of Passage Case, _supra_, and South-West Africa Cases,
Preliminary Objections, I.C.J. Reports, (1962), 319.

[^470/1]: I.C.J. Reports (1963), 15, especially at pp. 33--34, 37--38; and _see_ excellent
article on the case by D. H. N. Johnson, International and Comparative Law
Quarterly, Vol. 13 (1964), pp. 1143--1192. The case is useful also as confirming
the Court's powers to make a declaratory judgment in an appropriate
case.

[^470/2]: I.C.J. Reports (1966), 6, at pp. 18, 51. The Court also affirmed that it
could take account of moral principles only so far as manifested in legal form
(_ibid_., p. 34), and that it was not a legislative body, its duty being to apply,
not to make the law (_ibid_., p. 48). The absence of legal standing of the
claimant States was attributed, _inter alia_, to the exclusive, institutional responsibility
of League of Nations organs for supervising the fulfilment of the
terms of mandates.

[^470/3]: The Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, and the
various specialised agencies have been so authorised.

[^471/1]: _See_ Advisory Opinion on the _Legal Consequences for States of the Continued
Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa)_, June 21, 1971,

[^472/1]: _See_ the Advisory Opinion on the Status of Eastern Carelia, Pub. P.C.I.J.
(1923), Series B, No. 5 at 27--29. But this does not prevent the Court dealing
by advisory opinion with a legal question, the solution of which may clarify
a factor in a dispute between States or between a State and an international
institution, without affecting the substance of the dispute, or the solution of
which may provide guidance for an international organ in matters of the
procedure under, or the effect to be given to a multilateral Convention,
notwithstanding that one of the States concerned is not before the Court or
has not consented; _see_ the Advisory Opinions of the present Court on the
Interpretation of the Peace Treaties, I.C.J. Reports (1950), 65, 221, and on
Reservations to the Genocide Convention, I.C.J. Reports 1951, 15. Similarly,
the Court is not debarred from acceding to a request by a United Nations organ
for legal advice on the consequences of decisions of that organ, notwithstanding
that in order to give an answer, the Court may have to pronounce on legal
questions upon which there is a divergence of views between a particular
Member State, on the one hand, and the United Nations, on the other hand;
_see_ Advisory Opinion on the _Legal Consequences for States of the Continued
Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa)_, June 21, 1971,

[^473/4]: _See_ discussion in the _North Sea Continental Shelf Cases_, I.C.J. Reports,

Power Co., Ltd. (Second Phase)_, I.C.J. Reports, 1970, 3 (_see_ paragraphs 92--101
of the judgment), the Court declined to accept the proposition that, by virtue of
equitable principles, the national State of shareholders of a company, incorporated
in another State, was entitled to espouse a claim by shareholders for
loss suffered through injury done to the company.

[^474/4]: Pub. P.C.I.J. (1923), Series B, No. 4. The Court ruled that questions of
nationality cease to belong to the domain of exclusive domestic jurisdiction if
issues of treaty interpretation are incidentally involved, or if a State purports to
exercise jurisdiction in matters of nationality in a protectorate.

[^476/1]: _See_ Part II of the Hague Convention of 1907 on the Pacific Settlement of
International Disputes.

[^477/1]: These meanings of good offices and mediation have not been strictly
followed in United Nations practice. The United Nations Good Offices
Committee in Indonesia appointed by the Security Council in 1947 had more
extensive functions than good offices as such, e.g., reporting to the Security
Council on, and making recommendations as to developments in Indonesia,
1947--48; the United Nations Mediator in Palestine in 1948 was entrusted
with the duties of reporting on developments, of promoting the welfare of
the inhabitants of Palestine, and of assuring the protection of the Holy Places;
and the Good Offices Committee for the Korean hostilities appointed by
the United Nations General Assembly in 1951 was expected not merely to bring
about negotiations between the contending forces, but to propose means and
methods for effecting a cessation of hostilities. _Cf._ also the case of the Good
Offices Committee on South-West Africa, appointed in 1957. whose duty
was not only to discuss a basis of agreement with the South African Govern.
ment, but to report to the General Assembly.

[^477/2]: Hudson, International Tribunals (1944), p. 223.

[^478/1]: The United Nations General Assembly also favours this flexible procedure,
and has made various recommendations in the matter of the appointment of
rapporteurs and conciliators; _see below_, p. 602. Governments of a
number of member States of the United Nations have designated members of
a United Nations panel to serve on Commissions of conciliation and inquiry.

[^478/2]: There have been several instances of the use of conciliation, outside the
United Nations, since the end of the Second World War. The Bureau of the
Permanent Court of Arbitration makes its facilities available for the holding
of Conciliation Commissions. _Cf._ also Article 47 of the Hague Convention,
October 18, 1907, on the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes.

[^479/1]: An inquiry may necessitate the lodging of written documents similar to
pleadings, such as memorials and counter-memorials, and oral proceedings,
with the taking of evidence, as in the "Red Crusader" Inquiry (Great Britain-Denmark)
conducted at The Hague in 1962; _see_ Report of the 3-member
Commission of inquiry, March 23, 1962.

[^479/2]: _See_ U.N. Juridical Yearbook, 1964, pp. 166--174.

[^481/1]: _See_ further below, Chapter 19 at pp. 609--619 for detailed treatment.

[^481/2]: The Pact of Bogotá of April 30, 1948 (Inter-American Treaty on Pacific
Settlement), and the European Convention for the Peaceful Settlement of
Disputes, concluded at Strasbourg on April 29, 1957, are illustrations of
regional multilateral instruments with similarly detailed provisions for recourse
to different procedures of settlement of disputes.

[^482/1]: _See_, e.g., Article 14 of the United Nations Charter empowering the General
Assembly to "recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment of any
situation" likely to impair general welfare or friendly relations among nations
including situations resulting from a breach of the Charter.

[^484/1]: Unless used by way of justifiable reprisal, _semble_, a national boycott by
one State of the goods of another may amount to an act of economic aggression
in breach of international law. _See_ Bouvé, _American Journal of International
Law_ (1934), Vol. 28, pp. 19 _et seq._

[^484/2]: _Semble_, defensive naval or military demonstrations are permissible in
defence to an armed attack, but subsequent forcible self-help for purposes of
redress, added precautions, etc., is not; _cf._ Corfu Channel (Merits) Case, I.C.J.
Reports, 1949, pp. 4, 35.

[^484/3]: _See_ the Naulilaa Case (1928), Recueil of Decisions of the Mixed Arbitral
Tribunals, Vol. 8, p. 409, at pp. 422--5.

[^485/1]: By Resolution of May 18, 1951, during the course of the hostilities in
Korea, the United Nations General Assembly recommended a collective
embargo by States on the shipment of arms, ammunition and implements of
war, items useful in their production, petroleum, and transportation materials
to areas under the control of the Government of the People's Republic of
China, and of the North Korean authorities. A number of member States of
the United Nations acted upon this recommendation. Another case was the
decision of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American States at Punta del
Este, Uruguay, in January, 1962, acting under the Inter-American Treaty of
Reciprocal Assistance of September 2, 1947, to suspend trade with Cuba in
arms and implements of war of every kind. It was alleged that Cuba was
conducting subversive activity in America. Cuba challenged the validity of
the decision on the ground that it was enforcement action taken without the
authorisation of the Security Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations
Charter, but this objection was denied.

[^486/1]: The United States also consistently maintained that pacific blockades were
not applicable to American vessels.

[^487/1]: In the Presidential Proclamation of October 24, 1962, instituting the
blockade, these were listed as :---Surface-to-surface missiles; bomber aircraft;
bombs, air-to-surface rockets and guided missiles; warheads of any of these
weapons; mechanical or electronic equipment to support or operate these
items; and other classes designated by the U.S. Secretary of Defence.

[^487/2]: Its Council, meeting as a provisional Organ of Consultation under th
Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance of September 2, 1947, adopted
on October 23, 1962, a Resolution recommending member States to take
measures to ensure that Cuba should not receive military supplies, etc.

[^488/1]: _See_ pp. 109--116.
