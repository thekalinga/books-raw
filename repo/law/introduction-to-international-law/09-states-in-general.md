## STATES IN GENERAL

## NATURE OF A STATE AT INTERNATIONAL LAW

As we have seen, States are the principal subjects of international
law. Of the term "State" no exact definition is
possible, but so far as modern conditions go, the essential
characteristics of a State are well settled.

Article 1 of the Montevideo Convention of 1933 on the
Rights and Duties of States (signed by the United States
and certain Latin American Countries) enumerates these
characteristics :---

> The State as a person of international law should possess
the following qualifications :---
(a) a permanent population;
(b) a defined territory;
(c) a Government[^101/1]; and
(d) a capacity to enter into relations with other States.

As to (b), a fixed territory is not essential to the existence
of a State,[^101/2] although in fact all modern States are contained
within territorial limits. Accordingly, alterations, whether
by increase or decrease, in the extent of a particular State's
territory, do not of themselves change the identity of that
State.[^101/3] Nor need the territory possess geographical unity;
it may consist of territorial areas, lacking connection, or distant
from each other (e.g., the territory of Pakistan).

So far as international law is concerned, the qualification
(d) is the most important. A State must have recognised
capacity to maintain external relations with other States. This
distinguishes States proper from lesser units such as Members
of a Federation, or Protectorates, which do not manage their
own foreign affairs, and are not recognised by other States as
fully-fledged members of the international community.

The State is by no means necessarily identical with a particular
race or nation, although such identity may exist.

As we have already pointed out,[^102/1] Kelsen's conception of
the State emphasises that it is purely a technical notion expressing
the fact that a certain body of legal rules binds a certain
group of individuals living within a defined territorial area;
in other words, the State and the law are synonymous terms.[^102/2]
On closer analysis, it will be seen that this theory is a condensation
of the four characteristics of a State, set out above,
and, in particular, the existence of a legal system is involved in
the very requirement of a Government as a component of
Statehood, for as Locke said :---

> a government without laws is ... a mystery in politics,
inconceivable to human capacity and inconsistent with
human society.[^102/3]

In this connection, an important point is whether the statehood
of an entity depends upon that entity being itself legal,
and as well possessing a legal system which is juridically valid.
Is an illegal State a contradiction in terms? In Madzimbamuto
v. Lardner-Burke,[^102/4] the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
ruled that the Rhodesian regime created as a result of the
unilateral declaration of independence of November 11, 1965,
and of subsequent Rhodesian legislation, was illegal, and that,
notwithstanding the _de facto_ authority exercised by the regime,
the laws of that regime were illegal and void by virtue of
nullifying legislation in the United Kingdom.[^103/1] This raises
the question whether an entity, such as Rhodesia after the
unilateral declaration of independence, whose legal system is
deemed to be void and inoperative, fails in effect to fulfil the
third requirement of statehood, specified above, of possession
of an effective Government. In fact in a Resolution adopted
on November 17, 1970, the United Nations Security Council
expressly urged all States "not to grant any form of recognition
to the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia".[^103/2]

### "Micro-States"

A "micro-State" was defined by the Secretary-General of
the United Nations in his Introduction to his Annual Report
of the work of the Organisation, 1966--1967,[^103/3] as an entity,
exceptionally small in area, population and human and economic
resources", but which has emerged as an independent
State.[^103/4] The corresponding term in the pre-war days of the
League of Nations was a "Lilliputian State". As the Secretary-General
pointed out, even the smallest territories are
entitled through the exercise of the right of self-determination
to attain independence. However, there is necessarily a
difference between independence, on the one hand, and the
right of full membership of international organisations, such as
the United Nations, on the other. The obligations of membership
of the United Nations may be too onerous for micro-States
with their limited resources and population, while this
might also weaken the United Nations itself.

There can be forms of association with the United Nations,
short of full membership, conferring certain benefits without the
burdens, and in the interests both of micro-States and of full
member States, such as :---

(a) a right of access to the International
Court of Justice;

(b) participation in an appropriate
United Nations regional economic commission;

(c) participation
in certain of the specialised agencies, and in diplomatic
conferences summoned to adopt international Conventions.

Nor is there any valid objection to a micro-State maintaining
a permanent observer mission to the United Nations, as
distinct from a permanent mission proper. This does not
exhaust the possibilities of involvement in the work of the
United Nations and its specialised agencies, open to micro-States.[^104/1]

Apart from the relationship of micro-States to international
organisations, it seems that they may legitimately join with
other States in forming regional groupings or associations, or
in the establishment of a "Community" of a functional nature.

Is a micro-State none the less a State within the meaning of
the definition considered at the beginning of the present
Chapter? In principle, minuteness of territory and population,
imposing practical limitations upon capacity to conduct external
relations, do not constitute a bar to statehood.[^104/2] The non-participation
of a micro-State in the United Nations as a full
member is conditioned by the express terms of Article 4 of the
Charter, under which one requirement of admission is ability
to carry out the obligations contained in the Charter, and
inability for other reasons to meet this condition might be an
obstacle to the admission of a State of normal magnitude.

### Doctrine of Basic Rights and Duties of States

Numerous writers have purported to formulate lists of so-called
"basic" or "fundamental" rights and duties of States.
Such formulations have also been a persistent preoccupation of
international Conferences or international bodies; among
them may be mentioned those of the American Institute of
International Law in 1916, the Montevideo Convention of 1933
on the Rights and Duties of States, and the Draft Declaration
on the Rights and Duties of States drawn up by the International
Law Commission of the United Nations in 1949.[^105/1] This latter
Draft Declaration still remains a draft under study by Governments,
and has failed to command general adoption.

The doctrine of basic rights and duties was favoured by
certain of the naturalist writers,[^105/2] being derived by them from
the notion of the State as a creature of "natural law"; twentieth
century formulations of the doctrine, especially those made in
the Latin-American States, appear on the other hand to be
directed towards the establishment of universal standards of
law and justice in international relations, and this indeed
seems to be the object of the Draft Declaration of 1949 (_supra_).

The basic _rights_ most frequently stressed have been those of
the independence and equality of States, of territorial jurisdiction,
and of self-defence or self-preservation. The basic
_duties_ emphasised have been, among others, those of not
resorting to war, of carrying out in good faith treaty obligations,
and of not intervening in the affairs of other States.[^105/3]

There are grounds for scepticism as to the utility of the
doctrine. Certain of the rights and duties declared to be
"basic" seem no more fundamental than other rights and
duties not so formulated, or to be no more than restatements
of truisms or axioms of international law (for example, the
alleged basic duty to observe international law itself), or to be
too sweepingly general to be accurate. Also, although sometimes
international tribunals have invoked a certain basic
right or duty in determining the rules governing the case
before them,[^106/1] it may seriously be questioned whether this was
necessary for the purpose of their reaching a decision.[^106/2]

### Sovereignty and Independence of States

Normally a State is deemed to possess independence and
"sovereignty" over its subjects and its affairs, and within its
territorial limits. "Sovereignty" has a much more restricted
meaning today than in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
when, with the emergence of powerful highly nationalised
States, few limits on State autonomy were acknowledged. At
the present time there is hardly a State which, in the interests
of the international community, has not accepted restrictions
on its liberty of action. Thus most States are members of the
United Nations and the International Labour Organisation
(ILO), in relation to which they have undertaken obligations
limiting their unfettered discretion in matters of international
policy. Therefore, it is probably more accurate today to
say that the sovereignty of a State means the residuum of power
which it possesses within the confines laid down by international
law. It is of interest to note that this conception resembles
the doctrine of early writers on international law, who treated
the State as subordinate to the law of nations, then identified
as part of the wider "law of nature".

In a practical sense, sovereignty is also largely a matter of
degree. Some States enjoy more power and independence
than other States. This leads to the familiar distinction
between independent or sovereign States, and non-independent
or non-sovereign States or entities, for example, Protectorates
and colonies. Even here it is difficult to draw the line, for
although a State may have accepted important restrictions
on its liberty of action, in other respects it may enjoy the
widest possible freedom. "Sovereignty" is therefore a term of
art rather than a legal expression capable of precise definition.

When we say that a particular State is independent, in a
concrete way we attribute to that State a number of rights,
powers, and privileges at international law. Correlative to
these rights, etc., there are duties and obligations binding other
States who enter into relations with it. These rights, etc.,
and the correlative duties are the very substance of State
independence.

Examples of the rights, etc., associated with a State's
independence are :---

(a) the power exclusively to control its
own domestic affairs;

(b) the power to admit and expel aliens;

(c) the privileges of its diplomatic envoys in other countries;

(d) the sole jurisdiction over crimes committed within its
territory.

Examples of the correlative duties or obligations binding
States are :---


(i) the duty not to perform acts of sovereignty on
the territory of another State;

(ii) the duty to abstain and
prevent agents and subjects from committing acts constituting
a violation of another State's independence or territorial
supremacy;

(iii) the duty not to intervene in the affairs of
another State.

As to (i) it is, for instance, a breach of international law
for a State to send its agents to the territory of another State
to apprehend there persons accused of criminal offences against
its laws. The same principle has been considered to apply
even if the person irregularly arrested is charged with crimes
against international law, such as crimes against the peace or
crimes against humanity. Thus in June, 1960, the United
Nations Security Council adopted the view that the clandestine
abduction from Argentina to Israel of Adolf Eichmann, a
Nazi war criminal, to be tried by Israeli Courts, was an infringement
of Argentina's sovereignty, and requested Israel to proceed
to adequate reparation.[^108/1]
It is not clear whether international law goes so far as to
impose a duty on States to refrain from exercising jurisdiction
over persons apprehended in violation of the territorial
sovereignty of another State, or in breach of international
law. State practice is conflicting in this regard, but in the
Savarkar Case (1911),[^108/2] the Permanent Court of Arbitration
held that a country irregularly receiving back a fugitive is
under no obligation to return the prisoner to the country
where he had been apprehended. In the Eichmann Case (1961),
the Jerusalem District Court held, in a decision affirmed on
appeal, that it had jurisdiction to try Eichmann (_see above_)
for crimes against humanity and other crimes, notwithstanding
his irregular abduction to Israel from Argentina.[^108/3]

The principle of respect for a State's territorial sovereignty
is illustrated by the decision of the International Court of
Justice in the Corfu Channel Case (Merits) (1949).[^108/4] There the
Court held that the British protective minesweeping operations
in Albanian territorial waters in the Corfu Channel in November,
1946, three weeks after the damage to British destroyers
and loss of life through mines in the Channel, were a violation
of Albanian sovereignty, notwithstanding Albania's negligence
or dilatoriness subsequent to the explosions.

An illustration of (ii) is the duty on a State to prevent
within its borders political terrorist activities directed against
foreign States. Such a duty was expressed in Article 4 of
the Draft Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States,
prepared by the International Law Commission in 1949, and
in wider and more general terms in the Declaration on Principles
of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and
Co-operation Among States, in Accordance with the United
Nations Charter, adopted by the General Assembly in 1970.
On February 2, 1971, the duty was affirmed in Article 8 of the
Convention to Prevent and Punish Acts of Terrorism approved
by the General Assembly of the Organisation of American
States (OAS). The subject had been raised as long ago as the
year 1934 in connection with the assassination at Marseilles
by Macedonian terrorists of the Yugoslav monarch---King
Alexander. Yugoslavia formally accused the Hungarian
Government before the League of Nations of tacitly conniving
in the assassination inasmuch as it had knowingly allowed the
major preparations for the deed to be carried out on Hungarian
territory. In the course of the settlement of this dispute
between the two nations, the League of Nations Council
affirmed that two duties rested on every State :---

(1) neither to
encourage nor to tolerate on its territory any terrorist activity
with a political purpose;

(2) to do all in its power to prevent
and repress terrorist acts of a political character, and for this
purpose to lend its assistance to Governments which request it.[^109/1]

The duty not to intervene in the affairs[^109/2] of another State (_see_
(iii) above) requires some comment. International law
generally forbids such intervention, which in this particular
connection means something more than mere interference
and much stronger than mediation or diplomatic suggestion.
To fall within the terms of the prohibition, it must generally
speaking be in opposition to the will of the particular State
affected, and almost always, as Hyde points out,[^110/1] serving by
design or implication to impair the political independence of
that State. Anything which falls short of this is strictly
speaking not intervention within the meaning of the prohibition
under international law. A notable historical example of
dictatorial intervention---for which there was ostensible justification---was
the joint _démarche_ in 1895 by Russia, France and
Germany, to force Japan to return to China the territory of
Liaotung which she had extorted from the Chinese by the
Treaty of Shimonoseki. As a result of this intervention,
Japan was obliged to retrocede Liaotung to China, a fateful
step which led ultimately to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904--5.

The imperious type of diplomatic intervention just described
differs fundamentally from other more active kinds of interference
in the internal or external affairs of another State, which
are commonly grouped under the expression "intervention",
and which may go so far as to include military measures.
It is possible to distinguish[^110/2] three kinds of active, material
intervention, which unlike the type first mentioned, do not have
the character of a diplomatic _démarche_ :---

(1) "Internal" _Intervention_.-An example is State A interfering
between the disputing sections of State B, in favour
either of the legitimate Government or of the insurgents.

(2) "External" _Intervention_.--An example is State A interfering
in the relations--generally the hostile relations--of other
States, as when Italy entered the Second World War on the
side of Germany, and against Great Britain.

(3) "Punitive" _Intervention_.---This is the case of a reprisal,
short of war, for an injury suffered at the hands of another
State; for example, a pacific blockade instituted against this
State in retaliation for a gross breach of treaty.

The term "intervention" has also been used by some writers
in the expression "subversive intervention", to denote propaganda
or other activity by one State with the intention of
fomenting, for its own purposes, revolt or civil strife in another
State. International law prohibits such subversive intervention.[^111/1]

The following are, broadly expressed, the principal exceptional
cases in which a State has at international law a legitimate
right of intervention :---

(a) collective intervention[^111/2] pursuant to the Charter of the
United Nations;

(b) to protect the rights and interests, and the personal
safety of its citizens abroad;

(c) self-defence,[^111/3] if intervention is necessary to meet a
danger of an actual armed attack;

(d) in the affairs of a Protectorate under its dominion;

(e) if the State subject of the intervention has been guilty
of a gross breach of international law in regard to the
intervening State, for example, if it has itself unlawfully
intervened.

States must subordinate the exercise of any such exceptional
rights of intervention to their primary obligations under the
United Nations Charter, so that except where the Charter
permits it, intervention must not go so far as the threat or use
of force against the territorial integrity or political independence
of any State (_see_ Article 2 paragraph 4).

Before the Spanish Civil War of 1936--1938, the principle was
generally approved that revolution or civil war or other grave
emergency in another State might be cause for intervention
if the safety of the State desiring to intervene were affected
by the conflict, or emergency, or if there were serious interference
with the exercise by it of some rights which should be
respected.[^112/1]

How far this principle remains valid today, particularly in
the light of a State's obligations under the United Nations
Charter, is open to question. In 1936, the European Great
Powers departed from the principle by agreeing not to intervene
in the Spanish Civil War under any circumstances (even
by certain kinds of trading with the contestants). Twenty
years later, when in October-November, 1956, Great Britain
and France did jointly intervene by force against Egypt in the
Suez Canal zone, ostensibly in the Israeli-Egyptian conflict,
under claim of a threat to their vital interests, the preponderant
reaction of the rest of the world, as expressed in the United
Nations General Assembly, was to condemn this action as
_inter alia_ a breach of the United Nations Charter. It was
maintained that, as Egypt had not been guilty of any actual
armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 of the Charter,
recourse to an alleged right of collective self-defence was not
justified. For a similar reason, namely, the absence of any
actual armed attack, it has been claimed that the United States
action in landing forces in Beirut in July, 1958, on the invitation
of the President of Lebanon, to assist that country against an
alleged threat of insurrection stimulated and assisted from
outside, and to protect American lives and property, was not
_stricto sensu_ a measure of self-defence authorised by Article 51.[^113/1]

The Beirut landing was, however, justified not only as an act
of self-defence, but also on the ground that the legitimate
Government of Lebanon had consented to the intervention.
The general rule in this connection is that, in the case of strife,
which is primarily internal, and particularly where the outcome
is uncertain, the mere invitation by either faction to an outside
State to intervene does not legalise an otherwise improper
intervention. Inasmuch as it is claimed that subsequent events
showed that the strife in Lebanon was purely of an internal
character, the legality of the American intervention in Lebanon
has been doubted.[^113/2] An issue of a like nature arose in connection
with the extensive United States military assistance given
to South Vietnam, on the basis that the latter requested it, the
justification among others being that South Vietnam was
confronted with an insurrection directed and assisted from
outside. There is current controversy over this justification,
and, besides, the Vietnam problem is clouded over with some
contentious questions turning on the true interpretation and
application of the Geneva Agreements of July 20, 1954, which
terminated the hostilities in Indo-China between France and
the Viet Minh, and on the applicability of the South-East
Asia Collective Defence Treaty (SEATO), signed at Manila
on September 8, 1954. Another point is whether the United
States and other countries that were involved in assistance to
South Vietnam were acting by way of collective self-defence
under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter; there is
difficulty in seeing how this article can apply.

The Vietnam conflict, and the closely related affair in April-May
1970 of the incursion of American forces into Cambodia
(Khmer Republic) for the proclaimed purpose of destroying
North Vietnamese and Vietcong military sanctuaries, have
served to bring into focus some of the uncertainties in the
existing rules of international law as to intervention. A root
difficulty lies in the word "intervention" itself which, irrespective
of whether the case be one of a purely internal strife staked
upon gaining control over a whole people, or be, on the other
hand, an insurrection guided and supported from outside, is
inapt to describe military collaboration between an external
power and the legitimate Government at the express invitation
of, or with the implied consent of that Government. The
word "involvement" seems more appropriate for such collaboration,
and ideally there should be revised rules, dispensing
with the term "intervention" and setting the limits within
which involvement is permissible, if at all. But in the absence
of a revision of the relevant rules of the United Nations Charter,
such a reformulation of the law of intervention is a remote
possibility.

### Monroe Doctrine

The history of the American Monroe Doctrine throws some
light on the political, as distinct from the legal aspects of
intervention. As originally announced by President Monroe
in a Message to Congress in 1823, it contained three branches :---

(1) a declaration that the American Continent would no
longer be a subject for future colonisation by a European
Power;

(2) a declaration of absence of interest in European
wars or European affairs;

(3) a declaration that any attempt
by the European Powers "to extend their system" to any
portion of the American Continent would be regarded as
"dangerous" to the "peace and safety" of the United States.[^114/1]

The third branch was the most important, and by a paradoxical
development it came by the end of the nineteenth century to
attract a claim by the United States, enforced on several
occasions, to intervene in any part of the American Continent
subject to a threat of interference from a European Power, or
wherever in such Continent vital interests of the United States
were endangered. Thus a doctrine originally directed against
intervention was converted into a theory justifying intervention
by the State which had first sponsored the doctrine. After the
First World War, however, America's "good neighbour"
policy towards other American States brought the Monroe
Doctrine closer to its former objectives of 1823. And now by
reason of recent inter-American regional security arrangements,
it might seem as if the Monroe Doctrine regarded as an affirmation
of the solidarity of the American Continent, has been
transformed from a unilateral declaration[^115/1] into a collective
understanding of the American Powers.[^115/2] Possibly, to this
extent, the League of Nations Covenant in Article 21 may
now be regarded as correct in referring to the doctrine as a
"regional understanding". But the Monroe Doctrine has not
been completely multilateralised. To some extent, it still
retains its unilateral significance for the United States Government,
as indicated by the American "quarantine" or "selective"
blockade of Cuba in October, 1962, in order to forestall
the further construction of, or reinforcement of missile bases
on Cuban territory, and by the landing of United States units
in the Dominican Republic in April, 1965, to protect American
lives and to ensure that no Communist Government was
established in the Republic.

Sometimes by treaty, a State expressly excludes itself from
intervention; _cf._ Article 4 of the Treaty of 1929 between
Italy and the Holy See :---

>The sovereignty and exclusive jurisdiction over the Vatican
City which Italy recognises as appertaining to the Holy See
precludes any intervention therein on the part of the Italian
Government ...

### Doctrine of the Equality of States

The doctrine of the equality of States was espoused early
in the modern history of international law by those writers who
attached importance to a relationship between the law of
nations and the "law of nature". This is reflected in the following
passage, for example, from Christian Wolff's major work[^116/1] :---

> By nature all nations are equal the one to the other. For
nations are considered as individual free persons living in a
state of nature. Therefore, since by nature all men are equal,
all nations too are by nature equal the one to the other.

That the doctrine of equality subsists today with added strength,
but with some change of emphasis is shown by its reaffirmation
and definition under the heading, "The principle of sovereign
equality of States", in the Declaration on Principles of International
Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation
Among States in Accordance with the United Nations Charter,
adopted by the General Assembly in 1970. The Declaration
proclaimed the following principle :--- "All States enjoy
sovereign equality. They have equal rights and duties and are
equal members of the international community, notwithstanding
differences of an economic, social, political or other nature."
In the Charter of the United Nations, drawn up at San Francisco
in 1945, there is of course express recognition of the
doctrine. Article 1 speaks of "respect for the principle of
equal rights", and Article 2 says that the Organisation "is
based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its
Members". From the doctrine of equality, stems the duty
upon States, expressed in certain treaties,[^116/2] and found in the
law concerning resident aliens, not to discriminate in favour of
their own citizens as against the citizens of another State.

The doctrine imports not merely equality at law, but also the
capacity for equal legal rights and equal legal duties. The
results of the doctrine are seen particularly in the law and
practice as to multilateral treaties where generally the rule has
prevailed that unanimity is necessary for the adoption of these
instruments by States in Conference. This necessity for
unanimity rather hampered the progress of international
legislation. Frequently small States were able to hold up
important advances in international affairs by selfish obstruction
under the shelter of the unanimity rule. To quote one
authority[^117/1] :---

> The unanimity rule, conceived as the safeguard of the
minority, has, through exaggerating the doctrine of equality,
become an instrument of tyranny against the majority.

But the recent trend is towards decisions and voting by a
majority, instead of unanimously. This is particularly reflected
in voting procedures in the United Nations, the International
Labour Organisation, and other bodies.[^117/2]

Another alleged consequence of the principle of equality is
that, in the absence of a treaty, no State can claim jurisdiction
over, or in respect of another sovereign State.[^117/3] A more far-reaching
proposition is that the Courts of one State cannot
question the validity or legality of the acts of State of another
sovereign country or of its agents, and that such questioning
must be done, if at all, through the diplomatic channel; this is
the so-called "Act of State" doctrine, but it cannot be said to
be yet part of international law. The Courts of particular countries
may apply an "Act of State" doctrine under their own
municipal law system, or on grounds of domestic law or
practice (e.g., the consideration that the executive should not
be embarrassed in the diplomatic sphere) refrain from ruling
that an act of State of a recognised foreign sovereign country is
invalid,[^118/1] but this is not because of any mandatory principles
of international law requiring them so to proceed. In any
event, State Courts remain free in accordance with the rules
of their own municipal legal system to hold or abstain from
holding that a foreign act of State is invalid because in conflict
with international law.

There is indeed no general principle of international law
obliging States to give effect to the administrative acts of other
States. This is clearly illustrated by the prevailing "nationalistic"
system of patents, under which, subject to exceptions,
patents are granted solely on a domestic national basis, without
any general obligation to recognise a foreign grant.

Side by side with the principle of equality, there are however
_de facto_ inequalities which are perforce recognised. For
example, the five great powers, the United States, the Soviet
Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China are the sole
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council,
and may "veto" decisions of the Council on non-procedural
questions (_see_ article 27 of the United Nations Charter).[^118/2]
Moreover, there is the distinction between developed and less-developed
countries, expressly recognised in the new Part IV
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of October 30,
1947 (GATT), added by the Protocol of February 8, 1965
(_see_ the new articles 37--38). Then, as mentioned in the early
part of this Chapter,[^118/3] micro-States, with their limited resources
and small population have had to be treated as incapable of
coping with the full burdens of United Nations membership.
An entity which cannot be received as a plenary Member
State of the United Nations is not in a practical sense one which
has equal rights with a State actually admitted as a Member.

The line between, on the one hand, equality of States, and,
on the other hand, their independence, tends to become
blurred. Thus it is maintained that the right of a State freely
to choose and develop its political, social, economic, and
cultural systems appertains to equality,[^119/1] but _stricto sensu_ this
right is merely an expression of a State's independence.

Rules of Neighbourly Intercourse between States

There is one important qualification on the absolute independence
and equality of States, which has found expression in
the recent decisions of international Courts and to some extent
in the resolutions of international institutions. It is the
principle, corresponding possibly to the municipal law
prohibition of "abuse of rights", that a State should not
permit the use of its territory for purposes injurious to the
interests of other States. Thus in the United Nations deliberations
on the situation in Greece (1946--1949), it was implicitly
recognised that, whatever the true facts might be, Greece's
neighbours, Albania, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria were under a
duty to prevent their territory being used for hostile expeditions
against the Greek Government.[^119/2] Similarly, the Trail Smelter
Arbitration Case of 1941[^119/3] recognised the principle that a State
is under a duty to prevent its territory from being a source
of economic injury to neighbouring territory, e.g., by the
escape of noxious fumes. Another illustration is the Corfu
Channel Case (Merits) (1949),[^120/1] in which the International Court
of Justice held that once the Albanian Government knew of
the existence of a minefield in its territorial waters in the Corfu
Channel, it was its duty to notify shipping and to warn approaching
British naval vessels of the imminent danger, and
therefore it was liable to pay compensation to the British
Government for damage to ships and loss of life caused through
exploding mines. The Court stated that it was a "general
well-recognised principle" that every State is under an obligation
"not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts
contrary to the rights of other States".

In Article 74 of the United Nations Charter, the general
principle of "good-neighbourliness" in social, economic, and
commercial matters, is laid down as one which Member States
must follow in regard to both their metropolitan and their
dependent territories.

The principle of neighbourly obligations between States also
underlies the United Nations General Assembly Resolution of
November 3, 1947, condemning propaganda designed or likely
to provoke or encourage threats to the peace, breaches of the
peace, or acts of aggression.

Opinions differ not over the existence of the principle, but
as to the limits of its application, and in particular in regard
to the duties of States to provide safeguards in the use by them
of nuclear materials, while also it is questioned whether a State
devaluating or "freezing" its currency can be under any
liability for damage thereby caused to other States.

### Peaceful Co-existence

Closely associated with the principle of neighbourly obligations
between States is the recently developed concept of "peaceful
co-existence". Five principles of peaceful co-existence
were expressly agreed to by India and the People's Republic
of China in the Preamble to the Treaty on Tibet signed at
Peking on April 29, 1954. These were :---

(1) Mutual respect
for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

(2) Mutual
non-aggression.

(3) Mutual non-interference in each other's
affairs.

(4) Equality and mutual benefit.

(5) Peaceful coexistence.

Subsequently, the doctrine of peaceful co-existence
was referred to, or found expression in other treaties, and in
numerous international declarations, such as the Declaration
adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December
14, 1957, and the Final Communiqué of the Afro-Asian
Conference at Bandung, Indonesia, in April, 1955, which
adopted ten principles on the subject.[^121/1] There is also a rapidly
growing literature on the concept of peaceful co-existence, and
its precise place in international law.[^121/2]

Unfortunately, writers and publicists appear to disagree as
to the areas embraced by, and the limits of, the doctrine.
Some would restrict the concept of peaceful co-existence to
rules or principles ensuring that States belonging to different
political or economic systems should respect each other's
sovereignty, and should not seek to impose their system or ideas
upon other States. Others would extend the concept to cover
the subjects of disarmament, and self-determination, and even
so far as to include duties of active co-operation in economic,
cultural, and other fields. In any event, most of the principles
which, it is said, should be proclaimed as norms of peaceful
co-existence, are by no means novel, and seem to be expressed
or implied already in the Charter of the United Nations, and
in the Constitutions of other international organisations.
Probably, the true value of the concept of peaceful co-existence
lies in stressing the precise application of the rules in the Charter
and in these Constitutions to an international community
divided, as it is at present, into hostile blocs, and, if so, to
formalise and codify the principles involved would mitigate
tensions, even if not much was added to the terms of the
Charter.[^122/1]

## THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF STATES AND NON-STATE ENTITIES

The position of States at international law often varies, and
it is therefore necessary briefly to consider certain special cases
which arise. There may also, equally briefly, be examined in
this connection the cases of certain non-State entities, subjects
of international law. Mention may be made of an intermediate
class of what may be described as State-like entities, or collectivities
(_collectivités étatiques_); perhaps, the Holy See and
the Principality of Monaco[^122/2] may be regarded as falling within
this category.

### Federal States and Confederations

A Confederation (_Staatenbund_) is constituted by a number
of independent States bound together by an international
treaty or compact into a Union with organs of Government
extending over the member States and set up for the purpose
of maintaining the external and internal independence of all.
The Confederation is not a State at international law, the
individual States maintaining their international position.

A Federal State is, however, a real State at international law,
the essential difference between it and the Confederation
being that Federal organs have direct power not only over the
member States, but over the citizens of these States. In most
Federal States, external policy is conducted by the Federal
Government, but historically there have been exceptions to
this rule. For example, the member States of the pre-1914
Federal Germany were to some extent States at international
law; they could conclude treaties, appoint and receive envoys,
etc., and questions of law affecting their relations were decided
according to international law.

### Protected and Vassal States and Protectorates

A vassal State is one which is completely under the
suzerainty of another State.[^123/1] Internationally its independence
is so restricted as scarcely to exist at all.

The case of a Protectorate or a protected State arises in
practice when a State puts itself by treaty under the protection
of a strong and powerful State, so that the conduct of its most
important international business and decisions on high policy
are left to the protecting State.

Protectorates are not based on a uniform pattern. Each case
depends on its special circumstances and more specifically on :---

(a) the particular terms of the treaty of protection;[^123/2]

(b) the conditions under which the Protectorate is recognised
by third Powers as against whom it is intended
to rely on the treaty of protection.[^123/3]

Although not completely independent, a protected State
may enjoy a sufficient measure of sovereignty to claim jurisdictional
immunities in the territory of another State (per Lord
Finlay in Duff Development Co. V. Kelantan Government[^123/4]). It
may also still remain a State under international law.[^123/5]

### Condominium

A condominium exists when over a particular territory joint
dominion is exercised by two or more external Powers. An
example is the New Hebrides, in which the division of power is
of some complexity, with some functions assigned to the joint
administration, others residing in each of the national authorities
(United Kingdom and France), subject to appropriate
delegations of jurisdiction.

In a condominium, while the authority exercised over the
population is a joint sovereignty, each of the jointly governing
States in principle has separate jurisdiction over its own respective
subjects.[^124/1]

### Members of the Commonwealth

The position of Members of the Commonwealth, the former
British Commonwealth of Nations, has always been _sui generis_.
It is only since the Second World War that they have finally
completed a long process of emancipation, beginning as
dependent colonies, next acquiring the status of self-governing
colonies under the nineteenth century system of responsible
government, and then as Dominions moving towards the final
goal of statehood. So it is that since 1948 even the name and
style of "Dominions" had to be discarded.

The Member States of the Commonwealth are now fully
sovereign States in every sense. In the field of external affairs
autonomy is unlimited; Members enjoy and exercise extensively
the rights of separate legation and of independent negotiation
of treaties. They are capable of being subjects of international
disputes and of conflicts as between themselves. They may be
separately and individually belligerents or neutrals. They have
in fact concluded treaties with each other (_cf._ the "Anzac
Pact" of 1944 between Australia and New Zealand). A
marked development of the past seven years has been the
gradual supersession of _inter se_ Commonwealth rules by the
application of international law itself to practically all the
relations between member States. Hence, also, the position
of High Commissioners representing one member State in the
territory of another has been assimilated to that of diplomatic
envoys (_cf._ the British Diplomatic Immunities (Commonwealth
Countries and Republic of Ireland) Act, 1952).

As for the Commonwealth itself, it is of course neither
a Super-State nor a Federation, but simply a multi-racial
association of free and equal States who value this association,
who support the United Nations, who follow common principles
of non-discrimination as to colour, race, and creed, who
recognise for the purpose of their association, although some
of them be republics, that the British Sovereign is head of the
Commonwealth, and who, subject to exceptions, have somewhat
similar institutions and traditions of government. The
Commonwealth possesses a secretariat, yet the association is,
to use an appropriate description given by one Commonwealth
statesman,[^125/1] "functional and occasional". Although it is
sought through periodical Heads of Government Conferences,
and latterly by Conferences of Chief Justices and Law Officers,
to follow a common policy, differences of approach or of
opinion are not excluded and may run a wide gamut (as in 1956,
over the Anglo-French intervention in the Suez Canal zone,
in 1962 and 1971 concerning the proposed terms of the United
Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community,
in 1966 over the Rhodesian issue, and in 1971 over the question
of the supply of arms by the United Kingdom to South Africa
for joint defence of Indian Ocean sea routes). In ultimate
analysis, the Commonwealth is held together by a web of
mixed tangible and intangible advantages, that have evolved
pragmatically, and are difficult to express in terms of legal
relationships.

The Declaration adopted on January 22, 1971, by the Commonwealth
Heads of Government Conference at Singapore
contained some pertinent statements as to the nature and
purposes of the Commonwealth, which was defined as "a
voluntary association of independent sovereign States, each
responsible for its own policies, consulting and co-operating
in the common interests of their peoples and in the promotion
of international understanding and world peace". The
Declaration also affirmed that "membership of the Commonwealth
is compatible with the freedom of member Governments
to be non-aligned or to belong to any other grouping,
association or alliance". Emphasis was placed on the aspect
of consultation, the Commonwealth was declared to be "based
on consultation, discussion and co-operation", and to provide
"many channels for continuing exchanges of knowledge and
views on professional, cultural, economic, legal and political
issues among member States".

Trust Territories

Under the former League of Nations Covenant, there was
initiated in 1919--1920 the experiment of mandated territories.
These were former enemy territories which could not stand
on their own feet, i.e., could not take their place in the international
community without the support and guidance of a
guardian Power. Accordingly, such territories were given
under "mandate" to responsible States to be administered
subject to the supervision and ultimate authority of the League
of Nations, which in each case settled the terms of the mandate
to be observed by the tutelary Power.

The Charter of the United Nations Organisation drawn
up at San Francisco in 1945 introduced a new system of "trust
territories" as a logical extension of the former mandates
system. This trusteeship system was applicable to :---

(i) the
former mandated territories;

(ii) territories taken from enemy
States as a result of the Second World War;

(iii) territories
voluntarily placed under the trusteeship system by States
responsible for their administration.[^126/1]

The League mandates system was wound up in 1946 after
the entry into force of the United Nations Charter, and in the
expectation that the territories subject to mandate would be
voluntarily placed under the trusteeship system by the Mandatory
Powers. Accordingly no actual transfer of the territories
to the United Nations took place, the majority of the Mandatory
Powers having expressed an intention to bring these territories
under the trusteeship provisions of the Charter. A curious
position arose, however, with reference to the Mandated
Territory of South West Africa, of which the Union of South
Africa was Mandatory Power. South Africa did not follow
the example of all other Allied Mandatory Powers, and refused
to allow South West Africa to become a trust territory, and
declined, further, to recognise the supervisory authority of the
United Nations. The questions of the status of the Territory
and of South Africa's obligations in that connection were
submitted for determination to the International Court of
Justice which, although ruling by a majority that it was not
obligatory for South Africa to place the Territory under the
trusteeship system, nevertheless, also by a majority advised
that the Territory remained under the administration of South
Africa, subject to the terms of the original mandate, and subject
to the supervision of the United Nations General Assembly,
which by necessary implication stood in the place of the organs
of the League of Nations which had previously supervised the
working of the mandates system.[^127/1] In the _South West Africa
Cases, 2nd Phase_[^127/2], the International Court of Justice held
that individual member States of the League had no legal
claim or standing, by themselves, to enforce the terms of a
mandate, this being a matter for organic or institutional action.
The Charter provides that trust territories are to be administered
pursuant to trusteeship agreements under the auspices
and supervision of the United Nations. The Administering
Authority may be one or more States or the Organisation itself.
The basic objectives of the trusteeship system are stated to be,
among other things, the advancement of the peoples of trust
territories and their "progressive development towards self-government
or independence" (Article 76 of the United Nations
Charter). Although the latter phrase in italics shows that the
ultimate destiny of trust territories is not necessarily the attainment
of full statehood, in practice the goal aimed at was complete
independence. Moreover, it should not be overlooked
that the first basic objective stated in Article 76 of the Charter
is the furtherance of international peace and security; in respect
to certain trust territories, the system represented a compromise
between the competing claims of interested Powers.

In the events which have happened, the basic objectives of the
trusteeship system have been largely achieved. So far has the
process of emancipation from tutelage gone that only two
trust territories now remain :---

(1) The Trust Territory of the
Pacific Islands (the former Japanese mandated territories in the
Pacific), designated as a "strategic area" pursuant to Article 82
of the Charter, and under the United States as Administering
Authority.

(2) New Guinea, under Australia as Administering
Authority. Other trust territories have in different forms[^128/1]
achieved independence and statehood. In regard to the two
remaining trust territories, the United Nations has sought, and
is currently seeking, to establish the earliest possible "target
dates" for the attainment of autonomy.

The functions of the United Nations in respect to the supervision
of the trusteeship system and the approval of the terms
of trusteeship agreements were carried out :---

(a) in the case
of the Pacific Islands, the sole trust territory designated as
a "strategic area", by the Security Council, the Trusteeship
Council having the responsibility of examining the annual
reports of the United States as Administering Authority; and

(b) in the case of other trust territories, by the General Assembly,
assisted by the Trusteeship Council operating under its
authority. The Trusteeship Council is a principal organ of the
United Nations, and so differs fundamentally from the League
of Nations Mandates Commission, which was a subsidiary
organ of the League. Also by contrast with the Mandates
Commission which consisted of members acting in a personal
capacity, it is composed of delegates of Governments, being
representatives partly of administering countries, partly of the
permanent members of the Security Council, and partly of such
number of other Member States of the United Nations elected
for a three year term by the General Assembly as will ensure
equal representation for States administering trust territories
and those which do not (Article 86 of the Charter[^129/1]).

According to the Charter, the trusteeship agreements, containing
the basic terms on which each trust territory was to be
administered by the particular Administering Authority concerned,
were to be agreed upon by the "States directly concerned",
including the former Mandatory Power (_see_ Article
79). The interpretation of this phrase occasioned serious
disagreement,[^129/2] but in view of the fact that only two trust
territories remain and that further trusteeships of territories
are unlikely, its meaning is now of purely academic significance.
The trusteeship agreement for the Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands, being a "strategic area", differed from other agreements
in allowing the United States as Administering Authority
to close certain areas for security reasons, and in making the
concession of equal rights for other Member States of the
United Nations dependent on security requirements. Each
Administering Authority makes an annual report to the General
Assembly based upon a questionnaire drafted by the Trusteeship
Council. In supervising trusteeships, the Trusteeship
Council has of course no means of enforcing its decisions
although it can usefully exercise persuasion. It has power to
consider and appraise reports, to receive petitions, complaints,
and "communications" (so-called) from the peoples in the
territories, or from individuals in or outside these, and to send
missions on visit, but even in respect of these functions it is
rather a deliberative and recommendatory organ than one
with binding administrative authority.

The problem of legal sovereignty in the trusteeship system
was solved to the extent that the administering countries
expressly disclaimed any title to sovereignty.[^130/1] In view of this
explicit disclaimer, the question of where sovereignty did
reside, which troubled many writers in connection with mandates,
became then only of academic importance. However,
in the light of what happened ex post facto, when the majority
of trust territories became emancipated, there is much to be
said for the view that sovereignty resided latently in the peoples
themselves.

Finally, it should be mentioned that an Administering
Authority has express power to use volunteer forces, facilities,
and assistance from the trust territory in order that the
territory may play its part in the maintenance of international
peace and security (Article 84 of the Charter).

### Status of Non-Self-Governing Territories under United Nations Charter

The United Nations Charter accords a special status to
colonial territories, possessions, and dependencies under the
general designation of "non-self-governing territories". As in
the case of trust territories, the concept of a trust reposing
upon the administering States, is emphasised. By a Declaration
regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories contained in
Chapter XI of the Charter, Members of the United Nations
administering such territories recognised the principle that the
interests of the inhabitants were paramount, accepted as a
sacred trust the obligation to promote their well-being to the
utmost, and undertook to develop self-government, and to
assist in the evolution of free political institutions.

They also bound themselves to transmit regular information
on conditions in these territories to the Secretary-General of
the United Nations. The information thus transmitted came
to be examined by a Committee of the General Assembly,
known as the Committee on Information from Non-Self-Governing
Territories. This Committee, formerly appointed
on an _ad hoc_ basis for renewable terms of three years, was
converted into a semi-permanent organ as a result of a General
Assembly Resolution in December, 1961, appointing it until
such time as the Assembly has decided that the principles
embodied in Chapter XI of the Charter, and in the Assembly's
Declaration of December 14, 1960, on the Granting of Independence
to Colonial Countries and Peoples[^131/1] had been fully
implemented. It was empowered to review, and make recommendations
concerning social and economic conditions in
non-self-governing territories, and it had in fact received
evidence other than information transmitted under Chapter
XI of the Charter, including statements by Governments of
administering countries, and by international institutions. In
December, 1963, the General Assembly discontinued the Committee
on Information, and transferred its functions to the
Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation
of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence
to Colonial Countries and Peoples.[^131/2]

The provisions of Chapter XI of the Charter have been
given, in practice, a rather wider operation than was probably
contemplated when these were drafted. The General Assembly
has apparently taken the view that Chapter XI has greater
force than that of a merely unilateral undertaking. By
various Resolutions, and by the appointment of _ad hoc_
Committees in respect to particular territories, the Assembly
has sought to advance the attainment of independence by
non-self-governing territories, to emphasise the obligations of
States administering such territories, to promote the welfare
of the inhabitants, and to procure a wider participation or
association by the territories in, or with the work of the United
Nations and its specialised agencies. A rather striking aspect
is the extent to which thereby territories and dependencies
have come under the cognisance of United Nations subsidiary
organs.

### Neutralised States

A neutralised State is one whose independence and political
and territorial integrity are guaranteed _permanently_ by a
collective agreement of Great Powers subject to the condition
that the particular State concerned will never take up arms
against another State---except to defend itself-and will never
enter into treaties of alliance, etc., which may compromise its
impartiality or lead it into war.

The object of neutralisation is to safeguard peace by :---

(a) protecting small States against powerful adjacent States and
thereby preserving the balance of power;

(b) protecting and
maintaining the independence of "buffer" States lying between
Great Powers.

The essence of neutralisation is that it is a _collective_ act,
i.e., the Great Powers concerned must expressly or impliedly
assent to the status of neutrality permanently conferred on the
country, and that it is _contractual_, i.e., a State cannot be
neutralised without its consent, nor can it unilaterally announce
its neutralisation. Thus in 1938, when Switzerland
took steps to obtain recognition of its full neutrality by the
League of Nations, after a prior declaration of its independence
and neutrality, the Soviet Foreign Minister---Monsieur Litvinoff
---protested, perhaps correctly, that Switzerland could not so
declare its neutrality in the absence of prior agreement with all
other interested States. Nor is the case of the neutralisation of
Austria in 1955 an exception to the principle. The Austrian
legislature did, it is true, following upon the State Treaty of
May 15, 1955, re-establishing an independent democratic
Austria, enact a Constitutional Statute proclaiming Austria's
permanent neutrality. But this self-declared neutrality was
in pursuance of prior agreement[^132/1] with the Soviet Union, and
was recognised and supported by the other Great Powers, and
by other States.

Neutralisation differs fundamentally from neutrality, which
is a voluntary policy assumed temporarily in regard to a
state of war affecting other Powers, and terminable at any time
by the State declaring its neutrality. Neutralisation on the
other hand is a permanent status conferred by agreement
with the interested Powers, without whose consent it cannot
be relinquished. It is thus also essentially different from
"neutralism", a newly coined word denoting the policy of
a State not to involve itself in any conflicts or defensive
alliances. (There can be some fine shades of distinction
between "neutralism" and another expression, "non-alignment".)

The obligations of a neutralised State are as follows :---

(a) not to engage in hostilities except in self-defence;

(b) to abstain from agreements involving the risk of
hostilities, or granting of military bases, or use of its
territory for military purposes, for example, treaties
of alliance, guarantee, or protectorate, but not from
non-political conventions, for example, postal or tariff
Conventions;

(c) to defend itself against attack, even when calling on
the guarantors for assistance, by all the means at its
disposal;

(d) to obey the rules of neutrality during a war between
other States;

(e) not to allow foreign interference in its internal affairs.[^134/1]

The obligations of the States guaranteeing neutralisation
are :---

(a) to abstain from any attack or threat of attack on the
neutralised territory;

(b) to intervene by force when the neutralised territory is
violated by another Power, and the guarantors are
called on to act.

It is believed that under current conditions, and having
regard to the vast changes in the conditions of warfare and
armed conflict, including subversion and internal strife fomented
from outside, together with the difficulty of circumscribing and
localising any major conflict, the institution of neutralisation
has only a limited, specific role to play in the context of international
law.[^134/2]

Outstanding cases of neutralised States have been Switzerland,
Belgium and Austria. The most recent case is that of
Laos, which became a neutralised State by virtue of :---

a) its
unilateral Statement of Neutrality on July 9, 1962; and

(b) the
Thirteen-Power Declaration at Geneva on July 23, 1962, that
this status of Laos would be respected, and in effect guaranteed.

Belgium can no longer be regarded as a neutralised State
because of its participation in certain pacts of security and
mutual defence since the end of the Second World War (for
example, the North Atlantic Security Pact of April 4, 1949),
but Switzerland's status of permanent neutrality remains a
fundamental principle of international law. Although more
recent, Austria's neutralisation in 1955 is equally intended
permanently to rest on the law of nations.

A neutralised State can become a member of the United
Nations, for notwithstanding the provision in Article 2 paragraph
5 of the United Nations Charter that Member States
must give the Organisation every assistance in any action taken
in accordance with the Charter (which would include enforcement
action), the Security Council may under Article 48 exempt
a neutralised State from any such duty. It is significant, in
this connection, that Austria was admitted to the United
Nations on December 14, 1955, that is to say, subsequent to
the general recognition of its neutralisation.

### Right of Self-Determination of Peoples and Dependent Entities

The right of self-determination of peoples and dependent
entities has been expressly recognised by the United Nations
General Assembly in its Resolution on Self-Determination of
December 12, 1958, and in its Declaration of December 14,
1960, on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries
and Peoples. The right was defined in some detail, under the
heading "The principle of equal rights and self-determination
of peoples", in the Declaration on Principles of International
Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among
States in Accordance with the United Nations Charter, adopted
by the General Assembly in 1970. The Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights, and the Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights, unanimously approved by the General
Assembly on December 17, 1966, and opened for signature on
December 19, 1967, also recognise the right of peoples to self-determination.[^135/1]

The right of self-determination has been treated as necessarily
involving a number of correlative duties binding upon
States, including the duty to promote by joint and separate
action the realisation of the right of self-determination, and the
transfer of sovereign powers to the peoples entitled to this right,
and the duty to refrain from any forcible action calculated to
deprive a people of this right. These duties have been expressed,
or if not expressed are implied in the Declarations,
_ante_, adopted by the General Assembly, and in addition find
some support in the practice of the past decade. First, there
has been the rapid emancipation of many colonies and non-self-governing
territories. Second, there has been the impact
of the above-mentioned Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. In this
Declaration, the General Assembly proclaimed the necessity of
bringing to a speedy and unconditional end, colonialism in all
its forms and manifestations, and called for immediate steps to
be taken to transfer all powers to the peoples of territories
which had not yet attained independence. By a subsequent
Resolution of November 27, 1961, the Assembly established a
Special Committee of Seventeen to implement the Declaration,
and this Committee, enlarged in 1962 to consist of twenty-four
members, has since been active in all directions.[^136/1] Third, the
process of ratification and accession of the two Covenants,
mentioned above, should consolidate acceptance of the duties
correlative to the right of self-determination.

There still remains some difficulty as to what the expression
"self-determination" itself means, or includes. Presumably,
it connotes freedom of choice to be exercised by a dependent
people through a plebiscite or some other method of ascertainment
of the people's wishes.[^136/2] Another difficult problem is to
determine which communities of human beings constitute
"peoples" for the purpose of enjoying the right of self-determination.[^136/3]
Aspects such as common territory, common
language, and common political aims may have to be considered.

Prior to 1958, it could be said that customary international
law conferred no right upon dependent peoples or entities
to statehood, although exceptionally some such right _ad hoc_
might be given by treaty, or arise under the decision of an
international organisation.[^137/1] It is clear in the light of recent
practice that such right is not conditioned upon the attainment
of complete economic self-reliance.

### Sovereignty of Peoples and Nations over their Natural Wealth and Resources

In a similar connection, is the so-called principle of "economic
self-determination", expressed in the United Nations
General Assembly Resolution of December 21, 1952, affirming
the right of peoples freely to use and exploit their natural
wealth and resources. If the Resolution signified that, in the
absence of treaty limitations or international law restrictions,
a State was entitled to control the resources within its territory,
it would merely enunciate a truism. The real object of the
Resolution seems, however, to have been to encourage underdeveloped
countries to make use of their own resources, as a
proper foundation for their independent economic development.

Later, fuller and more elaborate expression was given to
the principle in Resolutions of the General Assembly dated
respectively December 14, 1962, and November 25, 1966, and
the right of all peoples freely to dispose of their natural wealth
and resources was affirmed in identical terms in Article 1 of the
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of December
16, 1966, and Article 1 of the Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights of the same date. Article 25 of the former Covenant
also declared that nothing therein was to be interpreted as
impairing the "inherent right of all peoples to enjoy and utilise
fully and freely their natural wealth and resources". There
have been other Resolutions of the General Assembly on the
subject, and these, together with the 1962 and 1966 Resolutions,
reflect not only the idea of a State's sovereign control over its
own resources, not to be surrendered but to be safeguarded
even when foreign capital is imported to promote development,
but also an insistence, implicitly if not expressly, that it is the
responsibility of the international community to assist in
maximising the exploitation and use of the natural wealth of
developing countries, and so contribute to strengthening their
capability to promote their economic development by their own
efforts. Since the ruling criterion is that of a State's permanent
sovereignty over its own resources, it is this State's national
law which according to the Resolutions must govern questions
of compensation for nationalisation or expropriation of foreign
enterprises, while remedies given in the national courts must be
exhausted before seeking relief in the international forum.

This affirmation and re-affirmation of the principle of a
nation's sovereign control over its own resources has
undoubtedly generated some new currents in international
economic law. One important result has been the far-reaching
United Nations programme for the evaluation and development
of natural resources.

## ASSOCIATIONS OR GROUPINGS OF STATES

States are free, consistently with their obligations under the
United Nations Charter, to form associations or groupings for
general or particular purposes. The Commonwealth, mentioned
above,[^138/1] remains an outstanding illustration, and so also
the Organisation of American States (OAS), and the Organisation
of African Unity. Some of these associations or groupings,
for example the European Economic Community (Common
Market), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO), are, in effect, of the character of international
organisations, and therefore come within the ambit of
Chapter 19, below.

Since the end of the Second World War, the number of such
associations or groupings of States has rapidly increased. The
principal functions or purposes served by them are political,
or economic, or related to the mutual defence and security of
the members. The novel feature of these new associations or
groupings is not only their diversity, but the establishment in
each instance of a permanent or semi-permanent machinery,
to enable them to function as working unities.

The majority of such bodies are regional in character or
have regional implications, but sometimes include States not
located in the region concerned.

On the economic side, there is the European Economic Community
(Common Market) established by the Treaty of Rome
of March 25, 1957, the European Free Trade Association
(EFTA) established by the Stockholm Convention of November
20, 1959, and the Latin American Free Trade Association
(LAFTA) established by the Montevideo Treaty of February,

Examples of unions or alliances of States for mutual security
purposes, supported by permanent machinery, are the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) formed pursuant to the
North Atlantic Security Pact of April 4, 1949, the South-East
Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) established under the
South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty signed at Manila
on September 8, 1954, and the association for security purposes
of Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (ANZUS)
under their Security Treaty signed at San Francisco on September
1, 1951.

It is too early as yet to determine the precise impact on international
law of these associations or groupings, each with
permanent organs, some of which indeed have been invested
with unusual powers. Usages and practices may develop,
pointing the way to a new field of international law.



[^101/1]: I.e., a Government to which the population renders habitual obedience
The temporary exile of the Government while an aggressor State is in military
occupation does not result in the disappearance of the State; _cf._ the cases of
Governments-in-exile (e.g., Norway) during the Second World War, 1939--45.

[^101/2]: Thus, Israel was admitted as a Member State of the United Nations in
May, 1949, notwithstanding that its boundaries were not then defined with
precision, pending negotiations regarding demarcation.

[^101/3]: A current continuing problem is whether :---

    (a) the former German State
    has disappeared as a result of the present condition of partition of Germany,
    with two separate Governments;

    (b) the German Federal Republic (West
    Germany) is identical with that former State.

    the identity and continuity of States in general, _see_ K. Marek, Identity and
    Continuity of States in Public International Law (1954).

trenchantly criticises the traditional notion of the "dualism" of the State
and the law,

[^103/1]: _See_, however, the dissenting judgement of Lord Pearce at pp. 731--745.
The Appellate Division of the High Court of Rhodesia also decided contra
in R. v. Ndhlovu, 1968 (4) S.A. 515, at pp. 532--535, holding, _inter alia_, that the
Government Rhodesia was the only lawful Gov rnment, and that effect
should be given to the laws and Constitution adopted in Rhodesia, pursuant to
which that Government was functioning.

[^103/2]: _Cf._ also the Resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly
on November 17, 1966, implicitly upholding a duty upon Member States to
recognise the former status of Rhodesia, and not to recognise the regime which
had come into being after the unilateral declaration of independence.

[^103/3]: _See_ Report, at p. 20.

[^103/4]: An illustration is Nauru, which attained independence on January 31,
1968; the area of the island is 8.25 square miles, and the indigenous population
about 3,000 persons. Professor S. A. de Smith, who is by far the most
eminent authority on administrative law in the United Kingdom, has written
a valuable, insightful book on micro-States, with particular reference to the
Pacific area, under the title Microstates and Micronesia (1970). For a monograph
on the subject, _see_ Dieter Ehrhardt, Der Begriff des Mikrostaats im
Völkerrecht und in der Internationalen Ordnung (Aalen, West Germany, 1970).

[^104/1]: As to these possibilities of participation, _see_ S. A. de Smith, _op. cit._,
pp. 10--14: Note also the status accorded to Nauru in 1968 of "special
member" of the Commonwealth, giving it a right of participation in functional
activities, and attendance at ministerial or official meetings on educational,
health, and technical questions, but not Heads of Government Conferences.

[^104/2]: _See_ Alain Coret, "L'Indépendence de l'Ile Nauru", Annuaire Français de
Droit International, 1968, pp. 178--188.

[^105/1]: The rights listed by the Commission in the Draft Declaration included the
rights of States to independence, to territorial jurisdiction, to equality in law
with other States, and to self-defence against armed attack. The duties
included those of not intervening in the affairs of other States, of not fomenting
civil strife in other States, of observing human rights, of settling disputes
peacefully, of not resorting to war as an instrument of national policy, and
of carrying out in good faith obligations under treaties.

closed.

[^109/1]: Arising out of this dispute, the League ultimately promoted the conclusion
in November, 1937, of a Convention for the Repression of International
Terrorism. This Convention did not, however, come into force. _Cf._ also in
a similar connection :---

    (a) The Convention adopted in July, 1936, under
    League auspices, concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace,
    under which the parties undertook to prohibit radio transmissions calculated
    to provoke the commission of acts affecting public safety in the territory of
    other States parties.

    (b) The Draft Convention on Freedom of Information
    sponsored by the United Nations.

[^109/2]: The duty extends both to internal and external affairs. This is recognised
in Articles 1 and 3 of the Draft Declaration on the Rights and Duties of
States adopted in 1949 by the United Nations International Law Commission,
and by the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly
Relations and Co-operation among States in Accordance with the United
Nations Charter, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1970,
which proclaims certain principles as to non-intervention. This Declaration
also treats as intervention an interference with a State's "inalienable right to
choose its political, economic, social and cultural systems". _Cf._ the Declaration
on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States,
and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty, adopted by the
U.N. General Assembly, December 21, 1965.

[^110/1]: Hyde, International Law (2nd Edition, 1947), Vol. I, § 69. It follows
logically that where a State consents by treaty to another State exercising a
right to intervene, this is not inconsistent with international law, as a general
rule.

pp. 32--33.

[^111/1]: _See_ the Resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly on this subº
ject, of November 3, 1947, of December 1, 1949, and of November 17, 1950,
and note Article 2 (5) of the International Law Commission's revised Draft
Code of Offences against the Peace and Security of Mankind, condemning
organised activities calculated to foment Civil Strife in another State
The Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly
Relations and Co-operation among States in Accordance with the United
Nations Charter, adopted the General Asse bly in 1970, proclaims that
"no State shall organise, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive,
terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the
régime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State".

[^111/2]: This would be by enforcement action under the authority of the United
Nations Security Council, pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter, or any
action sanctioned by the General Assembly under the Uniting for Peace
Resolution of November 3, 1950 (_see below_, p. 603). Otherwise, the United
Nations is prevented by Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter from intervening
in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.
_Semble_, the mere discussion by a United Nations organ of a matter on its
agenda affecting the internal jurisdiction of any State is not an "intervention"
in breach of this Article.

[^111/3]: As to which, _see below_, pp. 503--504. This would include collective self-defence
by the parties to a mutual security treaty such as the North Atlantic
Pact of April 4, 1949.

[^112/1]: Hyde, _op. cit._, §§ 69 _et seq._

[^113/1]: For reasons similar to those alleged in the case of Lebanon, British troops
were landed in Jordan upon the invitation of the Government of that country,
shortly after the Beirut landing.

[^113/2]: Moreover, the reports of the United Nations Observation Group in Lebanon
did not support any theory of outside intervention on a large scale.

[^114/1]: Branch (1) of the Monroe Doctrine arose out of the fact that Russia had
obtained territory in the North-West of the American Continent and laid claims
to the Pacific Coast. Branch (3) was directed against any intervention on the
part of the principal European Powers (the Triple Alliance) to restore the
authority of Spain over the rebellious colonies in Latin America which had
secured independence and recognition by the United States.

[^115/1]: In 1923, Secretary of State Hughes referred to the Monroe Doctrine as
being "distinctively the policy of the United States", and of which the
United States reserves to itself its definition, interpretation, and application":

[^115/2]: This development can be traced through the Act of Chapultepec, 1945,
the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance of Rio de Janeiro, 1947,
and the Bogotá Charter of the Organisation of American States, 1948, under
which, _inter alia_, a threat to the independence and security of any one American
State is regarded as a threat against all.

[^117/3]: _Semble_, this is rather an illustration of the sovereignty and autonomy of
States than of the principle of equality; _see_ Kelsen, General Theory of Law and
State (1961 Edition), at p. 253.

[^118/1]: _See_, e.g., decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Banco Nacional de Cuba
V. Sabbatino (1964), 376 U.S. 398 (validity of Cuban sugar expropriation
decrees, alleged to be in violation of international law, could not be questioned).
The effect of the decision was restricted by the Hickenlooper
Amendment (Foreign Assistance Act of 1965, re-enacting with amendments
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1964). Subsequently, the amendment was
construed narrowly as applying only to cases in which property was nationalised
abroad, contrary to international law, and the property or its traceable
proceeds came to the United States; _see_ Banco Nacional de Cuba v. First
National City Bank of New York (1970), 431 F. (2d) 394, following and applying
Sabbatino's Case. _Cf._ to a similar effect, French v. Banco Nacional de
Cuba (1968), 295 N.Y.S. (2d) 433 (although a stringent Cuban currency control
order constituted an act of State, its effect was outside the Amendment).

[^118/2]: _See below_, pp. 607--609. There are other somewhat similar cases in the
membership of the executive organs of other international organisations.

[^118/3]: _See_ p. 104, _ante_.

[^119/1]: _See_ the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning
Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the
United Nations Charter, adopted by the General Assembly in 1970, where this
right is stated to be one of the elements of the sovereign equality of States.
The Declaration also affirms that the duty to respect the personality of other
States is an element of equality, although such duty seems to be more concerned
with preserving the independence of States.

[^119/2]: _Cf._ Article 4 of the Draft Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States,
prepared by the International Law Commission of the United Nations,
providing for a duty upon every State "to refrain from fomenting civil strife
in the territory of another State, and to prevent the organisation within its
territory of activities calculated to foment such civil strife."

[^124/1]: Division into Separate Zones: Contrast with a condominium, a case of
joint authority, the division of a territory or entity into two or more separate
zones, each under the authority of a different State. Thus under the Memorandum
of Understanding of October 5, 1954, signed in London by Great
Britain, the United States, Italy, and Yugoslavia, the Free Territory of Trieste
was divided into a Western and an Eastern Zone under the interim administration
of Italy and Yugoslavia respectively.

[^126/1]: For discussion of the trusteeship system, and for comparison with the
League of Nations mandates system, _see_ generally Duncan Hall, Mandates,

the system, _see_ Sayre, Legal Problems Arising from the United Nations
Trusteeship System", _American Journal of International Law_ (1948), Vol. 42,
at pp. 263 _et seq._

[^127/1]: _See_ I.C.J. Reports (1950), 128. This view was upheld and reaffirmed by
the International Court of Justice over twenty years later in its Advisory
Opinion of June 21, 1971, on the _Legal Consequences for States of the Continued
Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa)_. The Court ruled in
addition that the failure of South Africa to comply with its obligation to
submit to the supervision of United Nations organs made its continued presence
in South West Africa illegal; _see_ I.C.J. Reports (1971), 16, at pp. 28, 35--43.

[^127/2]: _See_ I.C.J. Reports (1966), 6.

[^128/1]: In the case of the Trust Territory of Ruanda-Urundi, independence was
achieved in 1962 in the form of two separate States, the Republic of Rwanda,
and the Kingdom of Burundi. The Trust Territory of British Togoland was,
in 1957, united with the Gold Coast to form the new independent State of
Ghana, as a Member of the Commonwealth.

[^129/1]: The decline since 1959 in the number of States administering trust terri.
tories, in measure as these territories became emancipated, has made continuous
literal compliance with the principle of parity in this Article difficult,
if not impossible. For example, in July, 1962, the Council consisted of the
five permanent members of the Security Council, two of which, the United
Kingdom and the United States, were Administering Authorities, Australia
and New Zealand as States administering trust territories, and two nonadministering
countries, Bolivia and India. There are now only two administering
powers, Australia and the United States, the latter being a permanent
member of the Security Council, so that with the necessity of including the
four other permanent members of the Council, the rule of parity cannot work.
Upon the true construction of Article 86, it could not have been intended that
the parity rule would govern such a situation (_see also_ Note of Secretary-General
of November 23, 1967). _Semble_, therefore, the present composition
of the Trusteeship Council (Australia and the five permanent members of the
Security Council) conforms with the true intent of Article 86.

[^129/2]: The General Assembly approved trusteeship agreements submitted to it,
without identifying the "States directly concerned".

[^130/1]: _Semble_, also, an Administering Authority could not unilaterally modify the
status of a trust territory without the approval of the United Nations.

[^131/1]: _See below_, pp. 135--137.

[^131/2]: _See below_, pp. 135--136.

[^132/1]: Indeed, under this agreement, Austria was to "take all suitable steps to
obtain international recognition" of such declared neutralisation. In the
recent case of the neutralisation of Laos, the unilateral Statement of Neutrality
by Laos on July 9, 1962, was subsequently suppo ed by a Thirteen-Power
Declaration on July 23, 1962, that the sovereignty, independence, neutrality,
unity, and territorial integrity of Laos would be respected (the thirteen Powers
included Great Britain, the People's Republic of China, France, India, the
United States and the Soviet Union).

[^134/1]: In its Statement of Neutrality of July 9; 1962, Laos also bound itself not
to allow any country to use Laotian territory for the purposes of interference
in the internal affairs of other countries.

[^134/2]: _Cf._ C. E. Black, R. Falk, K, Knorr, and 0. Young, Neutralisation and
World Politics (1968).

Continued Presence of South Africa in South West Africa (Namibia)_, I.C.J.
Reports, 1971, 16, at pp. 54--56, where the International Court of Justice
treated the people of the Mandated Territory of South West Africa as having
an actual right of progress towards independence, which had been violated by
South Africa's failure as Mandatory Power to comply with its obligation to
submit to the supervision of United Nations organs.

[^136/1]: The full title of the Committee is "Special Committee on the Situation with
regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence
to Colonial Countries and Peoples". By the beginning of 1971,
it was reduced to a membership of twenty-one, as a result of the withdrawal
of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
