# Preface

There seems to be a general assumption today that the "Science of Law"
is not adequately performing its function in the judicial process. When
a great lawyer can voice the general opinion of the bar in stating that
the confusion and uncertainty caused by a vast mass of decisions and
principles is growing worse from year to year[^1], it is inevitable
that various conflicting attitudes toward this science should take the
place of a former uncritical acceptance. The conflict may be described,
somewhat inadequately[^2], in a few phrases:

1. A struggle to preserve old creeds against a growing skepticism;
2. An unconstructive skeptical attitude, either amused or discouraged,
    which proposes nothing;
3. An enthusiastic search for eternal verities through new
    methodologies on which there is no agreement.

This situation makes the law today the most fascinating of the social
sciences[^3]. Nevertheless, from the point of view of the practical
administration of justice, the undermining of old values seems to the
writer to be one of the factors in a certain loss of prestige of the
courts. In institutions, just as in individuals, the loss of self
assurance is always followed by a loss of power. And if certain
institutions, such as the courts or the church are not supported by a
generally accepted creed or philosophy, they lose the peculiar prestige
and respect to which they owe their influence.[^4] Thus our modern
skepticism about substantive law has brought us face to face with an
ancient paradox which may be expressed in this way: If courts --- or at
least persons who deal with courts --- did not so firmly believe that
justice was dispensed according to the inexorable dictates of impersonal
logical science, our machinery for the administration of law would not
exist as we know it today. Just as an individual must cherish dreams and
illusions, so also must his judicial institutions.

For this reason judges, at least while they are speaking from the bench,
must talk of substantive law as a scientific body of principles which
govern society. This unquestionably has a profound effect not only on
the attitude of society toward them, but also on their attitude toward
the problems which they attempt to solve. A free people resents
government by individuals. They insist that they will only obey the
self-imposed restraints which they see fit to impose on themselves. The
method by which courts are supposed to eliminate the personal and
arbitrary element from their decisions is supposed to be found in a
science of substantive law. Without such a conception the present power
and prestige of an independent judiciary would be difficult to maintain.

In the discussion which follows, the writer assumes without argument
that the work of most legal scholars will be directed toward preserving
and insuring the efficient operation of an independent judiciary as we
know it today. That there are other fields in which legal scholarship is
needed is unquestioned. But the particular task of restating substantive
law, whether in text books, articles, or by the American Law Institute
is certainly directed toward that end. If that kind of study is to be
effective in guiding an existing institution which claims to be applying
precepts, standards, and principles of substantive law, it becomes
necessary to understand just what part this conception of substantive
law plays in the operation of that institution. The problem is not
philosophical, but entirely practical.
