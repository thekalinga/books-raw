[^3]: "Our times may
well come to be named, by future dealers in half truths, the Tired
Age. Disillusionment is a mood of fashion as much as a form of _ennui_
after the war's great effort. Whatever the cause, our politics are
devoid of ardor and social reform has lost its romance. Such being
the mental climate, one would expect jurisprudence to be in the
doldrums and to earn its title as the dreary science. Alas for these
generalizations about the main currents of thought! The waters of
law are unwontedly alive. New winds are blowing on old doctrines,
the critical spirit infiltrates traditional formulas, philosophic
inquiry is pursued without apology _as it becomes clearer that
decisions are functions of some juristic philosophy_." (Italics

    as distinguished from legal principles.

[^7]: For
some purposes any definition of "substantive law" which puts the
entire emphasis on the so-called "science of law" and ignores
definite directions and institutional habits would be too narrow.
For the purpose of an objective examination of courts, however, we
wish to deal with the peculiar conceptions which are incident to an
independent judiciary. A rule receives very different treatments
when applied by an executive and applied by a court. We are
examining the conceptions which cause the difference in treatment,
not the rule itself. "... decisions are functions of some juristic
philosophy." See Frankfurter, _loc. _cit._ _supra_. note 3.

[^9]: Without the mystical concept of a "court" which induces such
    speeches it would be impossible to build up a reverential attitude
    toward such a thing as the "jurisdictional nature" of process, which
    still exists in defiance of common sense, and which is independent
    of any particular statute governing process. For example, see
    BOWERS, CIVIL PROCESS AND ITS SERVICE (1927) Preface.

    point out that he means no criticism of such a speech. Another kind
    of speech would not have had its effectiveness. It is the fact that
    such speeches are effective which illustrates our attitude toward
    courts.

    accomplished, see PARRY, THE GOSPEL AND THE LAW (1928) c. V. In 1918
    during the war only 206 persons were imprisoned on the judgment
    summons process. It is significant to point out that the author of
    this spirited attack on the process blames the "law," rather than
    the courts.

[^18]: The statements which follow, of course, do not attempt to be
    accurate but rather to set out a popular notion which still affects
    much legal scholarship, particularly that portion of it devoted to
    clarifying doctrine by logical analysis. An accurate general
    statement of what legal scholars are doing is, of course, impossible
    because they are doing so many things. It is, however, the writer's
    belief that the statements which follow are fairly descriptive of an
    attitude which is often instinctively taken. Subjects like torts or
    contracts are usually so separated intellectually from jurisprudence
    in textbook thought that an instinctive conventional approach is
    adopted in the former which may be denied in the latter subject.

[^19]: The perennial dispute as to whether facts and social conditions or
    doctrine should be the basis of legal study owes its continuance
    largely to the fact that when we speak of "law" we usually refer to
    all of these situations at once, without differentiation between
    them. We might add still others. For example: We often call "law"
    those protective devices which lawyers use to safeguard a client
    from all possible trouble with courts; as, for example, the long
    forms which attempt to protect a sales contract of an automobile
    from the hazards of the courts of forty-eight states. No one reads
    the form until trouble arises and then it becomes the stuff out of
    which legal arguments are made. We also refer to as "law" the ideals
    which give prestige and authority to courts. That different
    approaches are necessary in these different situations is indicated
    by Pound, _The Call for a Realist Jurisprudence_ (1931) 44 HARV. L.
    REV. 697. A somewhat different classification, but with the same
    idea in mind, is found in Frank, _Are Judges Human_ (1931) 80 U. OF

    ecclesiastical jurisdiction." 2 GARDINER, HISTORY OF ENGLAND (1883)

[^27]: "The Act provides that the Court of Criminal Appeal shall allow an
    appeal against conviction if it thinks the verdict of the jury
    should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot
    be supported by the evidence or resulted from a wrong decision on
    any question of law or if it thinks that on any ground there was a
    miscarriage of justice. In all other cases it must dismiss the
    appeal and in this connection it is provided that even though the
    court is of the opinion that the point raised might be decided in
    favor of the appellant it may still dismiss the appeal if it
    considers that 'no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually
    occurred.'" HOWARD, CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN ENGLAND (1931) 280.

[^28]: "As the costs in even a simple appeal may easily amount to £100 or
    £200 it is obvious that a litigant will hesitate before taking this
    step." GOODHART, ESSAYS IN JURISPRUDENCE AND THE COMMON LAW (1931)
    215.

[^29]: "Perhaps the reason why the English Lawyer is not dissatisfied with
    the present system is that the 'myriad' precedents do not exist.
    The English cases to 1865 are reprinted in the _English Reports_ in
    about 175 volumes. The semiofficial _Law Reports_ from 1865 to the
    present date occupy about 450 volumes. Thus 625 volumes make up a
    complete working library." GOODHART, _op. _cit._ _supra_. note 28, at 57.

[^30]: "Only a small proportion of the decided cases are reported each
year; unless a case deals with a novel point of law --- and novelty
is strictly construed --- it will rarely find its way into the
_Reports_. ... It is hardly surprising to find that the English lawyer
has no difficulty in digesting the annual reports, and that he does
not, therefore, demand a change in the established system." GOODHART, _op. _cit._ _supra_. note 28, at 57.

    Of course English writers would deny the statement that this
    selective process is ever used as a method of avoiding inconvenient
    cases. The writer, however, believes that a selective system of
    printing cases inevitably cuts down the possibility of encumbering
    legal principles with qualifications and exceptions, even though
    this is not the conscious intent.

[^31]: "A search through the English periodicals since 1900 does not show a
    single article or note by an English lawyer in which the system has
    been adversely criticized. No modern English poet has arisen to
    denounce the English Law as Tennyson did seventy years ago:

    >Mastering the lawless science of our law,
    >
    >That codeless myriad of precedent,
    >
    >That wilderness of single instances,
    >
    >Through which a few, by wit or fortune led,
    >
    >May beat a pathway out to wealth or fame."

    GOODHART, _op. _cit._ _supra_. note 28, at 56--57. The writer contends
    that the reason the poets of today are silent is because the English
    have devised procedural escapes from the consequences of too rigid
    application of the rule of _stare decisis_, rather than because of any
    sudden change in the nature of English judges.

[^36]: This is becoming less true every year. Dean Pound in _The Call for a
    Realistic Jurisprudence_ set out the need for a discussion of the
    utility of doctrine in the judicial process and also the relevancy
    of a study of the psychological factors involved. (1931) 44 HARV. L.
    REV. 697. Leon Green, in JUDGE AND JURY (1930), emphasizes the
    function of legal doctrine in the delimitation of functions of trial
    and appellate courts and juries. Two recent articles in the Yale Law
    Journal indicate by their titles that the function of legal concepts
    instead of their logical analysis is the center of interest.

    Nevertheless the statement still represents a widely prevalent
    attitude.

[^37]: This is illustrated by an interesting controversy over the nature of
    the code "Cause of Action." Dean Clark proposed a test which left
    the determination of the extent of the cause to the discretion of
    the court, having in mind the facts of the particular case. CLARK,
    CODE PLEADING (1928) 83. This was attacked on the ground of (1) lack
    of certainty and (2) lack of symmetry by three able scholars all of
    whom sought to define the fundamental elements of the term in the
    various dissimilar situations in which it was used. McCaskill,
    _Actions and Causes of Actions_ (1925) 34 YALE L. J. 614; Harris, _What
    is a Cause of Action_ (1928) 16 CALIF. L. REV. 459; Gavit, _The Code
    Cause of Action: Joinder and Counterclaims_ (1930) 30 COL. L. REV.
    802. The significance of the controversy lies in the fact that in
    spite of the dialectic ability of the three last named authors
    seeking the fundamental elements of the "cause of action" they not
    only disagree with each other, but also with the earlier definitions
    of the term.

[^39]: The uniform sales act in its generalizations as to when title
    passes, offers a simple set of principles which are not descriptive
    of the numberless situations where they are employed, but which
    serve as a classification of these cases at least as good as any
    which the writer has seen suggested.

[^40]: To the writer's mind Mr. Foster establishes this conclusively in his
    articles. See note 38, _supra_.

[^41]: It is assumed here that if the sole purpose of instructions in
    negligence cases were to put the jury, unfamiliar with legal
    concepts, in the proper frame of mind to determine liability, and
    such instructions were not considered as accurate expressions of the
    "law of negligence" many of our elaborate definitions of negligence,
    and its qualifying doctrines, would disappear. The two questions,
    when will a court permit a jury to pass on a case, and how will the
    court talk to the jury, could be sharply distinguished in any
    formulation of negligence law which treated the question as one of
    distribution of power. See GREEN, JUDGE AND JURY (1930) 153 _et seq._

[^44]: It must be apparent that the writer has used the terms "substantive
    law" and "procedure" to describe different attitudes, rather than
    the classification found in the law school curriculum. Many of the
    concepts which are ordinarily denominated "procedural" have been
    treated with the attitude of "substantive law" thought this is becoming
    less frequent. See McCaskill; Harris; and Gavit, all _supra_. note 37.
