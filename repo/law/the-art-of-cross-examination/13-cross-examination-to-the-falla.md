## CROSS-EXAMINATION TO THE FALLACIES OF TESTIMONY

It is intended in this chapter to analyze some of the
elements of human nature and human understanding
that combine to conceal the truth about any given
subject under investigation, where the witnesses are
themselves honest and unconscious of any bias, or parti-
sanship, or motive for erroneous statement.

Rufus Choate once began one of his more abstruse
arguments before Chief Justice Shaw in the following
manner: " In coming into the presence of your Honor
I experience the same feelings as the Hindoo when he
bows before his idol. I realize that you are ugly, but I
feel that you are great!"

I am conscious of something of the same feeling as I
embark upon the following discussion. I realize the
subject is dry, but I feel that its importance to all serious
students of advocacy is great.

No one can frequent our courts of justice for any
length of time without finding himself aghast at the
daily spectacle presented by seemingly honest and intel-
ligent men and women who array themselves upon
opposite sides of a case and testify under oath to what
appear to be absolutely contradictory statements of
fact.

It will be my endeavor in what follows to deal with this
subject from its psychological point of view and to trace
some of the _causes_ of these unconscious mistakes of wit-
nesses, so far as it is possible. The inquiry is most ger-
mane to what has preceded, for unless the advocate
comprehends something of the _sources_ of the fallacies
of testimony, it surely would become a hopeless task
for him to try to illuminate them by his cross-exami-
nations.

It has been aptly said that “Knowledge is only the
impression of one's mind and _not the fact itself_, which
may present itself to many minds in many different
aspects." The _unconscious sense impressions_---sight,
sound, or touch ---would be the same to every human
mind; but once you awaken the mind to consciousness,
then the original impression takes on all the color of
motive, past experience, and character of the individual
mind that receives it. The _sensation_ by itself will be
always the same. The variance arises when the sensa-
tion is _interpreted_ by the _individual_ and becomes a _per-
ception_ of his own mind.

When a man on a hot day looks at a running stream
and sees the delicious coolness, he is really adding some-
thing of himself, which he acquired by his past experi-
ence to the _sense impression_ which his eye gives him.
A different individual might receive the impression of
tepid insipidity instead of "delicious coolness" in accord-
ance with his own past experiences. The material of
sensation is acted on by the mind which clothes the sen-
sation with the experiences of the individual.141/1 Helm-
holtz distinctly calls the perception of _distance_, for
example, an unconscious _inference_,. ---a mechanically
performed act of judgment.

The _interpretation_ of a sensation is, therefore, the act
of the individual, and different individuals will naturally
vary in their interpretations of the same sensation ac-
cording to their previous experiences and various mental
characteristics. This process is most instantaneous,
automatic, and unconscious. "The artist immediately
sees details where to other eyes there is a vague or
confused mass; the naturalist sees an animal where
the ordinary eye only sees a form."141/2 An adult sees an
infinite variety of things that are meaningless to the
child.

Likewise the same impression may be differently in-
terpreted by the same individual at different times, due
in part to variations in his _state of attention_ at the
moment, and in the degree of the mind's readiness to
look at the impression in the required way. A timid
man will more readily fall into the illusion of ghost-see-
ing than a cool-headed man, because he is less attentive
to the actual impression of the moment.

141/2 "Problems of Life and Mind," C. H. Lewes, p. 107.

Every mind is attentive to what it sees or hears, more
or less, according to circumstances. It is in the region
of hazy impressions that the imagination is wont to get in
its most dangerous work. It often happens that, when
the mind is either inactive, or is completely engrossed by
some other subject of thought, the sensation may neither
be perceived, nor interpreted, nor remembered, notwith-
standing there may be evidence, derived from the re-
spondent movements of the body, that it has been felt;
as, for example, a person in a state of imperfect sleep
may start at a loud sound, or turn away from a bright
light, being conscious of the sensation and acting auto-
matically upon it, but forming no kind of appreciation of
its source and no memory of its occurrence.142/1 Such is
the effect of sensation upon _complete_ inattention. It
thus appears that it is partly owing to this variation in
_intensity_ of attention that different individuals get such
contradictory ideas of the same occurrence or conversa-
tion. When we add to this variance in the degree of
attention, the variance, just explained, in the individual
_interpretation_ or coloring of the physical sensation, we
have still further explanation of why men so often differ
in what they think they have seen and heard.

_Desire_ often gives rise to still further fallacy. Desire
prompts the will to fix the attention on a certain point,
and this causes the emphasis of this particular point or
proposition to the exclusion of others. The will has the
power of keeping some considerations out of view, and
thereby _diminishes_ their force, while it fixes the attention
upon others, and thereby _increases_ their force.

142/1" Mental Philosophy," Carpenter (in part).


Sir John Romilly, in an opinion reported in 16 Beavan,
105, says: "It must always be borne in mind how
extremely prone persons are to believe what they wish.
It is a matter of frequent observation that persons dwell-
ing for a long time on facts which they believed must
have occurred, and trying to remember whether they did
so or not, come at last to persuade themselves that they
do actually _recollect_ the occurrences of circumstances
which at first they only begin by _believing_ must have
happened. What was originally the result of imagina-
tion becomes in time the result of recollection. Without
imputing anything like wilful and corrupt perjury to wit-
nesses of this description, they often in truth _bona fide_
believe that they have heard and remembered conversa-
tions and observations which in truth never existed, but
are the mere offspring of their imaginations."

Still another most important factor and itself the
source of an enormous number of "fallacies of testi-
mony" is memory. We are accustomed to speak of
memory as if it consisted in an _exact_ reproduction of
past states of consciousness, yet experience is continually
showing us that this reproduction is very often _inexact_.
through the modifications which the “trace" has under-
gone in the interval. Sometimes the trace has been
partially obliterated; and what remains may serve to
give a very erroneous (because imperfect) view of the
occurrence. When it is one in which our own feelings
are interested, we are extremely apt to lose sight of what
goes against them, so that the representation given by
memory is altogether one-sided. This is continually
demonstrated by the entire dissimilarity of the accounts
of the same occurrence or conversation which is often
given by two or more parties concerned in it, even when
the matter is fresh in their minds, and they are honestly
desirous of telling the truth. This diversity will usually
become still more pronounced with the lapse of time,
the trace becoming gradually but unconsciously modified
by the habitual course of thought and feeling, so that
when it is so acted upon after a lengthened interval as to
bring up a reminiscence of the original occurrence, that
reminiscence really represents, _not_ the original occur-
rence, but the modified trace of it.144/1

Mr. Sully says: "Just as when distant objects are
seen mistily our imaginations come into play, leading
us to fancy that we see something completely and dis-
tinctly, so when the images of memory become dim,
our present imagination helps to restore them, putting
a new patch into the old garment. If only there is
some relic even of the past preserved, a bare sugges-
tion of the way in which it _may have_ happened will
often suffice to produce the conviction that it actually
did happen in this way. The suggestions that naturally
arise in our minds at such times will bear the stamp of
our present modes of experience and habits of thought.
Hence, in trying to reconstruct the remote past we are
constantly in danger of importing our present selves
into our past selves."

144/1 " Campbell's Mental Physiology" (in great part).

Senator George F. Hoar, in his recently published
"Autobiography of Seventy Years," says:---

>The recollections of the actors in important political
transactions are doubtless of great historic value. But I
ought to say frankly that my experience has taught me
that the memory of men, even of good and true men, as
to matters in which they have been personal actors, is
frequently most dangerous and misleading. I could re-
count many curious stories which have been told me by
friends who have been writers of history and biography,
of the contradictory statements they have received from
the best men in regard to scenes in which they have been
present.

It is obviously the province of the cross-examiner to
detect the nature of any foreign element which may
have been imported into a witness's memory of an event
or transaction to which he testifies, and if possible to
discover the source of the error; whether the memory
has been warped by desire or imagination, or whether
the error was one of original perception, and if so,
whence it arose, whether from lack of attention or
from wrong association of previous personal expe-
rience.

Not only does our idea of the past become inexact
by the mere decay and disappearance of essential fea-
tures; it becomes positively incorrect through the gradual
incorporation of elements that do not properly belong
to it. Sometimes it is easy to see how these extraneous
ideas become imported into our mental representation
of a past event. Suppose, for example, that a man
has lost a valuable scarf-pin. His wife suggests that
a particular servant, whose reputation does not stand
too high, has stolen it. When he afterwards recalls
the loss, the chances are that he will confuse the fact
with the conjecture attached to it, and say he remem-
bers that this particular servant did steal the pin. Thus
the past activity of imagination serves to corrupt and
partially falsify recollections that have a genuine basis
of fact.146/1

A very striking instance of the effect of _habit_ on the
memory, especially in relation to events happening in
moments of intense excitement, was afforded by the
trial of a man by the name of Twichell, who was justly
convicted in Philadelphia some years ago, although by
erroneous testimony. In order to obtain possession
of some of his wife's property which she always wore
concealed in her clothing, Twichell, in great need of
funds, murdered his wife by hitting her on the head
with a slug shot. He then took her body to the yard
of the house in which they were living, bent a poker,
and covered it with his wife's blood, so that it would
be accepted as the instrument that inflicted the blow,
and having _unbolted the gate_ leading to the street,
left it ajar, and went to bed. In the morning, when the
servant arose, she stumbled over the dead body of her
mistress, and in great terror she rushed through the
gate, into the street, and summoned the police. The
servant had always been _in the habit_ of unbolting this
gate the first thing each morning, and she swore on
the trial that she had done the same thing upon the
morning of the murder. There was no other way the
house could have been entered from without excepting
through this gate. The servant's testimony was, there-
fore, conclusive that the murder had been committed
by some one from _within_ the house, and Twichell was
the only other person in the house.

146/1 "Illusions," p. 264 (in part).


After the conviction Twichell confessed his guilt to
his lawyer and explained to him how careful he had
been _to pull back the bolt and leave the gate ajar_ for
the very purpose of diverting suspicion from himself.
The servant in her excitement had failed either to notice
that the bolt was drawn or that the gate was open, and
in recalling the circumstance later she had allowed her
usual daily _experience_ and _habit_ of pulling back the
bolt to become incorporated into her recollection of
this particular morning. It was this piece of fallacious
testimony that really convicted the prisoner.

As the day of the execution drew near, Twichell
complained to the prison authorities that the print in
the prison Bible was too fine for him to read, and re-
quested that his friend---a druggist---be allowed to
supply him with a Bible in larger type. This friend
saturated some of the pages of the Bible with corrosive
sublimate. Twichell rolled these pages up into balls,
and, with the aid of water, swallowed them. Death was
almost instantaneous.

Boswell in his "Life of Dr. Johnson,"148/1 has related the
particulars of his first meeting with Dr. Johnson, whom
he had been long very desirous of seeing and conversing
with. At last they accidentally met at the house of a
Mr. Davies.

Mr. Arthur Murphy, in his "Essay on the Life and
Genius of Dr. Johnson," likewise gives a description of
Boswell's first meeting with Johnson. Concerning Mr.
Murphy's account of the matter, Mr. Boswell says: "Mr.
Murphy has given an account of my first meeting with
Dr. Johnson considerably different from my own, and I
am persuaded, without any consciousness of error, his
memory at the end of near thirty years has undoubtedly
deceived him, and he supposes himself to have been
present at a scene which he has probably heard inaccu-
rately described by others. In my own notes, _taken on
the very day in which I am confident I marked everything
material that passed_, no mention is made of this gentle-
man; and I am sure that I should not have omitted one
so well-known in the literary world. It may easily be
imagined that this, my first interview with Dr. Johnson,
with all its circumstances, made a strong impression on
my mind and would be registered with peculiar atten-
tion."

148/1 Vol. ii., p. 165.

A writer in the _Quarterly Review_,149/1 speaking of this
same occurrence, says: "An erroneous account of Bos-
well's first introduction to Dr. Johnson was published by
Arthur Murphy, _who asserted that he witnessed it_. Bos-
well's appeal to his own strong recollection of so memo-
rable an occasion and to the narrative he entered in his
Journal at the time show that Murphy's account was
quite inaccurate, and that he _was not present_ at the scene.
This, Murphy did not later venture to contradict. As
Boswell suggested, he had doubtless heard the circum-
stances repeated till at the end of thirty years he had
come to fancy that he was an actor in them. His good
faith was unquestionable, and that he should have been
so deluded is a memorable example of the fallibility of
testimony and of the extreme difficulty of arriving at the
truth."

Perhaps the most subtle and prolific of all of the
"fallacies of testimony" arises out of _unconscious parti-
sanship_. It is rare that one comes across a witness in
court who is so candid and fair that he will testify as
fully and favorably for the one side as the other.

It is extraordinary to mark this tendency we all have
when once we are identified with a "side" or cause, to
accept all its demands as our own. To put on the
uniform makes the policeman or soldier, even when in
himself corrupt, a guardian of law and order.

149/1 _Quarterly Review_, vol. ciii., p. 292.

Witnesses in court are almost always favorable to
the party who calls them, and this feeling induces them
to conceal some facts and to color others which might,
in their opinion, be injurious to the side for which they
give their testimony. This partisanship in the witness-
box is most fatal to fair evidence; and when we add
to the partisanship of the witness the similar leaning of
the lawyer who is conducting the examination, it is
easy to produce evidence that varies very widely from
the exact truth. This is often done by overzealous
practitioners by putting leading questions or by incor-
porating two questions into one, the second a simple
one, misleading the witness into a "yes" for both, and
thus creating an entirely false impression.

What is it in the human make-up which invariably
leads men to take sides when they come into court? In
the first place, witnesses usually feel more or less _com-
plimented by the confidence_ that is placed in them by
the party calling them to prove a certain state of facts,
and it is human nature to try to prove worthy of this
confidence. This feeling is unconscious on the part
of the witness and usually is not a strong enough motive
to lead to actual perjury in its full extent, but it serves
as a sufficient reason why the witness will almost un-
consciously dilute or color the evidence to suit a par.
ticular purpose and perhaps add only a _bit_ here, or
suppress one there, but this bit will make all the differ-
ence in the meaning.

Many men in the witness-box feel and enjoy a _sense
of power_ to direct the verdict toward the one side or the
other, and cannot resist the temptation to indulge it and
to be thought a "fine witness" for their side. I say
their side; the side for which they testify always becomes
their side the moment they take the witness chair, and
they instinctively desire to see that side win, although
they may be entirely devoid of any other interest in the
case whatsoever.

It is a characteristic of the human race to be intensely
interested in the success of some one party to a contest,
whether it be a war, a boat race, a ball game, or a law-
suit. This desire _to win_ seldom fails to color the testi-
mony of a witness and to create fallacies and inferences
dictated by the witness's _feelings_, rather than by his _intel-
lect_ or the dispassionate powers of observation.

Many witnesses take the stand with no well-defined
motive of what they are going to testify to, but upon
discovering that they are being led into statements.
unfavorable to the side on which they are called, experi-
ence a sudden dread of being considered _disloyal_, or
going back on "the party who selected them, and
immediately become unconscious partisans and allow
this feeling to color or warp their testimony.

There is still another class of persons who would not
become witnesses for either side unless they felt that
some wrong or injustice had been done to one of the
parties, and thus to become a witness for the injured
party seems to them to be a vindication of the right.
Such witnesses allow their feelings to become enlisted in
what they believe to be a cause of righteousness, and
this in turn enlists their sympathy and feelings and
prompts them to color their testimony as in the case of
those influenced by the other motives already spoken of.

One sees, perhaps, the most marked instances of par-
tisanship in admiralty cases which arise out of a colli-
sion between two ships. Almost invariably all the crew
on one ship will testify in unison against the opposing
crew, and, what is more significant, such passengers as
happen to be on either ship will almost invariably be
found corroborating the stories of their respective crews.

It is the same, in a lesser degree, in an ordinary per-
sonal injury case against a surface railway. Upon the
happening of an accident the casual passengers on board
a street car are very apt to side with the employees in
charge of the car, whereas the injured plaintiff and
whatever friends or relatives happen to be with him at
the time, will invariably be found upon the witness-stand
testifying against the railway company.

It is difficult to point out the methods that should be
employed by the cross-examiner in order to expose to a
jury the particular source of the fallacy that has warped
the judgment, choked the conscience, or blinded the in-
telligence, of any particular witness. It must necessarily
all depend upon the circumstances arising in each par-
ticular case. All I have attempted to do is to draw
attention to the _usual_ sources of these fallacies, and I
must perforce leave it to the ingenuity of the trial lawyer
to work out his own solution when the emergency arises.
This he certainly would never be able to do successfully,
unless he had given careful thought and study to this
branch of his professional equipment.

The subject is a great one, and rarely, if ever, dis-
cussed by law writers, who usually pass it by with the
bare suggestion that it is a topic worthy of deep in-
vestigation upon the proper occasion. I trust that my
few suggestions may serve as a stimulus to some philo-
sophic legal mind to elaborate and elucidate the reasons
for the existence of this _flaw_ in the human mechanism,
which appears to be the chief stumbling block in our
efforts to arrive at truth in courts of justice.
