## CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE PERJURED WITNESS

In the preceding chapters it was attempted to offer a
few suggestions, gathered from experience, for the proper
handling of an honest witness who, through ignorance or
partisanship, and more or less unintentionally, had testi-
fied to a mistaken state of facts injurious to our side of
the litigation. In the present chapter it is proposed to
discuss the far more difficult task of exposing, by the
arts of cross-examination, the intentional Fraud, the per-
jured witness. Here it is that the greatest ingenuity of
the trial lawyer is called into play; here rules help but
little as compared with years of actual experience. What
can be conceived more difficult in advocacy than the
task of proving a witness, whom you may neither have
seen nor heard of before he gives his testimony against
you, to be a wilful perjurer, as it were out of his own
mouth?

It seldom happens that a witness's entire testimony is
false from beginning to end. Perhaps the greater part
of it is true, and only the crucial part --- the point, how-
ever, on which the whole case may turn---is wilfully
false. If, at the end of his direct testimony, we conclude
that the witness we have to cross-examine--- to continue
the imaginary trial we were conducting in the previous
chapter--- comes under this class, what means are we to
employ to expose him to the jury?

Let us first be certain we are right in our estimate
of him --- that he intends perjury. Embarrassment is
one of the emblems of perjury, but by no means always
The novelty and difficulty of the situation ---being
called upon to testify before a room full of people, with
lawyers on all sides ready to ridicule or abuse---often
occasions embarrassment in witnesses of the highest
integrity. Then again some people are constitutionally
nervous and could be nothing else when testifying in
open court. Let us be sure our witness is not of this
type before we subject him to the particular form of
torture we have in store for the perjurer.


Witnesses of a low grade of intelligence, when they
testify falsely, usually display it in various ways: in the
voice, in a certain vacant expression of the eyes, in a
nervous twisting about in the witness chair, in an ap-
parent effort to recall to mind the exact wording of their
story, and especially in the use of language not suited
to their station in life. On the other hand, there is
something about the manner of an honest but ignorant
witness that makes it at once manifest to an experienced
lawyer that he is narrating only the things that he has
actually seen and heard. The expression of the face
changes with the narrative as he recalls the scene to
his mind; he looks the examiner full in the face; his
eye brightens as he recalls to mind the various incidents;
he uses gestures natural to a man in his station of life,
and suits them to the part of the story he is narrating,
and he tells his tale in his own accustomed language.

If, however, the manner of the witness and the wording
of his testimony bear all the earmarks of fabrication, it
is often useful, as your first question, to ask him to
repeat his story. Usually he will repeat it in almost
identically the same words as before, showing he has
learned it by heart. Of course it is possible, though not
probable, that he has done this and still is telling the
truth. Try him by taking him to the middle of his
story, and from there jump him quickly to the beginning
and then to the end of it. If he is speaking by rote
rather than from recollection, he will be sure to succumb
to this method. He has no facts with which to associate
the wording of his story; he can only call it to mind
as a whole, and not in detachments. Draw his attention
to other facts entirely disassociated with the main story
as told by himself. He will be entirely unprepared for
these new inquiries, and will draw upon his imagination
for answers. Distract his thoughts again to some new
part of his main story and then suddenly, when his mind
is upon another subject, return to those considerations
to which you had first called his attention, and ask him
the same questions a second time. He will again fall
back upon his imagination and very likely will give a
different answer from the first ---and you have him in
the net. He cannot invent answers as fast as you can
invent questions, and at the same time remember his
previous inventions correctly; he will not keep his an-
swers all consistent with one another. He will soon
become confused and, from that time on, will be at your
mercy. Let him go as soon as you have made it
apparent that he is not mistaken, but lying.

An amusing account is given in the _Green Bag_ for
November, 1891, of one of Jeremiah Mason's cross-exami-
nations of such a witness. "The witness had previously
testified to having heard Mason's client make a certain
statement, and it was upon the evidence of that state-
ment that the adversary's case was based. Mr. Mason
led the witness round to his statement, and again it was
repeated verbatim. Then, without warning, he walked
to the stand, and pointing straight at the witness said,
in his high, impassioned voice, 'Let's see that paper
you've got in your waistcoat pocket!' Taken com-
pletely by surprise, the witness mechanically drew a paper
from the pocket indicated, and handed it to Mr. Mason.
The lawyer slowly read the exact words of the witness
in regard to the statement, and called attention to the
fact that they were in the handwriting of the lawyer on
the other side.

'Mr. Mason, how under the sun did you know that
paper was there?' asked a brother lawyer. Well;
replied Mr. Mason, 'I thought he gave that part of his
testimony just as if he'd heard it, and I noticed every
time he repeated it he put his hand to his waistcoat
pocket, and then let it fall again when he got through.'"

Daniel Webster considered Mason the greatest lawyer
that ever practised at the New England Bar. He said
of him, "I would rather, after my own experience, meet
all the lawyers I have ever known combined in a case,
than to meet him alone and single-handed." Mason was
always reputed to have possessed to a marked degree
"the instinct for the weak point" in the witness he was
cross-examining.

If perjured testimony in our courts were confined to
the ignorant classes, the work of cross-examining them
would be a comparatively simple matter, but unfortunately
for the cause of truth and justice this is far from the
case. Perjury is decidedly on the increase, and at the
present time scarcely a trial is conducted in which it
does not appear in a more or less flagrant form. Noth-
ing in the trial of a cause is so difficult as to expose the
perjury of a witness whose intelligence enables him to
hide his lack of scruple. There are various methods of
attempting it, but no uniform rule can be laid down as to
the proper manner to be displayed toward such a witness.
It all depends upon the individual character you have to
unmask. In a large majority of cases the chance of
success will be greatly increased by not allowing the wit-
ness to see that you suspect him, before you have led him
to commit himself as to various matters with which you
have reason to believe you can confront him later on.

Two famous cross-examiners at the Irish Bar were
Sergeant Sullivan, afterwards Master of the Rolls in
Ireland, and Sergeant Armstrong. Barry O'Brien, in
his "Life of Lord Russell," describes their methods.
"Sullivan," he says, "approached the witness quite in
a friendly way, seemed to be an impartial inquirer seek-
ing information, looked surprised at what the witness
said, appeared even grateful for the additional light
thrown on the case. 'Ah, indeed! Well, as you have
said so much, perhaps you can help us a little further.
Well, really, my Lord, this is a very intelligent man.'
So playing the witness with caution and skill, drawing
him stealthily on, keeping him completely in the dark
about the real point of attack, the little sergeant'
waited until the man was in the meshes, and then flew
at him and shook him as a terrier would a rat.

"The 'big Sergeant' (Armstrong) had more humor
and more power, but less dexterity and resource. His
great weapon was ridicule. He laughed at the witness
and made everybody else laugh. The witness got con-
fused and lost his temper, and then Armstrong pounded
him like a champion in the ring."

In some cases it is wise to confine yourself to one or
two salient points on which you feel confident you can
get the witness to contradict himself out of his own
mouth. It is seldom useful to press him on matters
with which he is familiar. It is the safer course to
question him on circumstances connected with his story,
but to which he has not already testified and for which
he would not be likely to prepare himself.

A simple but instructive example of cross-examination,
conducted along these lines, is quoted from Judge J. W.
Donovan's "Tact in Court." It is doubly interesting in
that it occurred in Abraham Lincoln's first defence at a
murder trial.

Grayson was charged with shooting Lockwood at a
camp-meeting, on the evening of August 9, 18---, and
with running away from the scene of the killing, which
was witnessed by Sovine. The proof was so strong that,
even with an excellent previous character, Grayson came
very near being lynched on two occasions soon after his
indictment for murder.

"The mother of the accused, after failing to secure
older counsel, finally engaged young Abraham Lincoln,
as he was then called, and the trial came on to an early
hearing. No objection was made to the jury, and no
cross-examination of witnesses, save the last and only
important one, who swore that he knew the parties, saw
the shot fired by Grayson, saw him run away, and picked
up the deceased, who died instantly.

The evidence of guilt and identity was morally cer-
tain. The attendance was large, the interest intense.
Grayson's mother began to wonder why 'Abraham re-
mained silent so long and why he didn't do something!'
The people finally rested. The tall lawyer (Lincoln)
stood up and eyed the strong witness in silence, without
books or notes, and slowly began his defence by these
questions:

_Lincoln_. 'And you were with Lockwood just before
and saw the shooting?'

_Witness_. 'Yes.'

_Lincoln_. 'And
you stood very near to them?’

_Witness_. 'No, about twenty feet away.'

_Lincoln_. 'May it not have been ten feet?'

_Witness_. 'No, it was twenty feet or more.'

_Lincoln_. 'In the open field?'

_Witness_. 'No, in the timber.'

_Lincoln_. 'What kind of timber?'

_Witness_. 'Beech timber.'

_Lincoln_. 'Leaves on it are rather thick in August?'

_Witness_. 'Rather.'

_Lincoln_. 'And you think _this_ pistol was the one used?'

_Witness_. 'It looks like it.'

_Lincoln_. 'You could see defendant shoot - see how
the barrel hung, and all about it?'

_Witness_. 'Yes.'

_Lincoln_. 'How near was this to the meeting place?'

_Witness_. 'Three-quarters of a mile away.'

_Lincoln_. 'Where were the lights?'

_Witness_. 'Up by the minister's stand.'

_Lincoln_. 'Three-quarters of a mile away?'

_Witness_. 'Yes, --- I answered ye _twiste_.'

_Lincoln_. 'Did you not see a candle there, with
Lockwood or Grayson?'

_Witness_. 'No! what would we want a candle for?'

_Lincoln_. 'How, then, did you see the shooting?'

_Witness_. 'By moonlight!' (defiantly).

_Lincoln_. 'You saw this shooting at ten at night---
in beech timber, three-quarters of a mile from the lights
saw the pistol barrel ---saw the man fire---saw it
twenty feet away ---saw it all by moonlight? Saw it
nearly a mile from the camp lights?'

_Witness_. 'Yes, I told you so before.'

The interest was now so intense that men leaned
forward to catch the smallest syllable. Then the lawyer
drew out a blue-covered almanac from his side coat
pocket ---opened it slowly----offered it in evidence ----
showed it to the jury and the court-read from a page
with careful deliberation that the moon on that night
was unseen and only arose at _one_ the next morning.

Following this climax Mr. Lincoln moved the arrest
of the perjured witness as the real murderer, saying:
'Nothing but a _motive to clear himself_ could have in-
duced him to swear away so falsely the life of one who
never did him harm!' With such determined emphasis
did Lincoln present his showing that the court ordered
Sovine arrested, and under the strain of excitement he
broke down and confessed to being the one who fired
the fatal shot himself, but denied it was intentional."

A difficult but extremely effective method of exposing
a certain kind of perjurer is to lead him gradually to a
point in his story, where ---in his answer to the final
question "Which?" ---he will have to choose either one
or the other of the only two explanations left to him,
either of which would degrade if not entirely discredit
him in the eyes of the jury.

The writer once heard the Hon. Joseph H. Choate
make very telling use of this method of examination.
A stock-broker was being sued by a married woman for
the return of certain bonds and securities in the broker's
possession, which she alleged belonged to her. Her
husband took the witness-stand and swore that he had
deposited the securities with the stock-broker as collat-
eral against his market speculations, but that they did
not belong to him, and that he was acting for himself
and not as agent for his wife, and had taken her securi-
ties unknown to her.

It was the contention of Mr. Choate that, even if the
bonds belonged to the wife, she had either consented to
her husband's use of the bonds, or else was a partner
with him in the transaction. Both of these contentions.
were denied under oath by the husband.

_Mr. Choate_. "When you ventured into the realm of
speculations in Wall Street I presume you contemplated
the possibility of the market going against you, did you
not?"

_Witness_. "Well, no, Mr. Choate, I went into Wall
Street to make money, not to lose it."

_Mr. Choate_. "Quite so, sir; but you will admit, will
you not, that sometimes the stock market goes contrary
to expectations?"

_Witness_. "Oh, yes, I suppose it does."

_Mr. Choate_. "You say the bonds were not your own
property, but your wife's?"

_Witness_. "Yes, sir."

_Mr. Choate_. And you say that she did not lend them
to you for purposes of speculation, or even know you had
possession of them?"

_Witness_. "Yes, sir."

_Mr. Choate_. "You even admit that when you depos-
ited the bonds with your broker as collateral against
your stock speculations, you did not acquaint him with
the fact that they were not your own property?"

_Witness_. "I did not mention whose property they
were, sir."

_Mr. Choate_ (in his inimitable style). "Well, sir, in the
event of the market going against you and your collat-
eral being sold to meet your losses, _whom did you intend
to cheat, your broker or your wife_?"

The witness could give no satisfactory answer, and
for once a New York jury was found who were willing
to give a verdict against the customer and in favor of a
Wall Street broker.

In the great majority of cases, however, the most skil-
ful efforts of the cross-examiner will fail to lead the
witness into such "traps" as these. If you have accom
plished one such _coup_, be content with the point you
have made; do not try to make another with the same
witness; sit down and let the witness leave the stand.

But let us suppose you are examining a witness with
whom no such climax is possible. Here you will require
infinite patience and industry. Try to show that his
story is inconsistent with itself, or with other known
facts in the case, or with the ordinary experience of man-
kind. There is a wonderful power in persistence. If
you fail in one quarter, abandon it and try something
else. There is surely a weak spot somewhere, if the
story is perjured. Frame your questions skilfully. Ask
them as if you wanted a certain answer, when in reality
you desire just the opposite one. Hold your own tem-
per while you lead the witness to lose his" is a Golden
Rule on all such occasions. If you allow the witness a
chance to give his reasons or explanations, you may be
sure they will be damaging to you, not to him. If you
can succeed in tiring out the witness or driving him to
the point of sullenness, you have produced the effect of
lying.

But it is not intended to advocate the practice of
lengthy cross-examinations because the effect of them,
unless the witness is broken down, is to lead the jury to
exaggerate the importance of evidence given by a witness
who requires so much cross-examination in the attempt
to upset him. “During the Tichborne trial for perjury,
a remarkable man named Luie was called to testify. He
was a shrewd witness and told his tale with wonderful
precision and apparent accuracy. That it was untrue
there could hardly be a question, but that it could be
proved untrue was extremely doubtful and an almost
hopeless task. It was an improbable story, but still was
not an absolutely impossible one. If true, however, the
claimant was the veritable Roger Tichborne, or at least
the probabilities would be so immensely in favor of that
supposition that no jury would agree in finding that he
was Arthur Orton. His manner of giving his evidence
was perfect. After the trial one of the jurors was asked
what he thought of Luie's evidence, and if he ever
attached any importance to his story. He replied that
at the close of the evidence-in-chief he thought it so
improbable that no credence could be given to it. But
after Mr. Hawkins had been at him for a day and could
not shake him, I began to think, if such a cross-examiner
as that cannot touch him, there must be something in
what he says, and I began to waver. I could not under-
stand how it was that, if it was all lies, it did not break
down under such able counsel."62/1

The presiding judge, whose slightest word is weightier
than the eloquence of counsel, will often interrupt an
aimless and prolonged cross-examination with an abrupt,
"Mr. ------, I think we are wasting time," or "I shall
not allow you to pursue that subject further," or "I can-
not see the object of this examination." This is a set-
back from which only the most experienced advocate can
readily recover. Before the judge spoke, the jury, per-
haps, were already a little tired and inattentive and
anxious to finish the case; they were just in the mood to
agree with the remark of his Honor, and the “ ATMOSPHERE
of the case," as I have always termed it, was fast becom-
ing unfavorable to the delinquent attorney's client. How
important a part in the final outcome of every trial this
atmosphere of the case usually plays! Many jurymen
lose sight of the parties to the litigation --- our clients---
in their absorption over the conflict of wits going on
between their respective lawyers.

62/1 "Hints on Advocacy," Harris.

It is in criminal prosecutions where local politics are
involved, that the jury system is perhaps put to its sever-
est test. The ordinary juryman is so apt to be blinded
by his political prejudices that where the guilt or inno-
cence of the prisoner at the Bar turns upon the question
as to whether the prisoner did or did not perform some
act, involving a supposed advantage to his political party,
the jury is apt to be divided upon political lines.

About ten years ago, when a wave of political reform
was sweeping over New York City, the Good Govern-
ment Clubs caused the arrest of about fifty inspectors
of election for violations of the election laws. These
men were all brought up for trial in the Supreme Court
criminal term, before Mr. Justice Barrett. The prison-
ers were to be defended by various leading trial lawyers,
and everything depended upon the result of the first few
cases tried. If these trials resulted in acquittals, it was
anticipated that there would be acquittals all along the
line; if the first offenders put on trial were convicted
and sentenced to severe terms in prison, the great
majority of the others would plead guilty, and few would
escape.

At that time the county of New York was divided,
for purposes of voting, into 1067 election districts,
and on an average perhaps 250 votes were cast in
each district. An inspector of one of the election
districts was the first man called for trial. The charge
against him was the failure to record correctly the vote
cast in his district for the Republican candidate for
alderman. In this particular election district there
had been 167 ballots cast, and it was the duty of the
inspectors to count them and return the result of their
count to police headquarters.

At the trial twelve respectable citizens took the wit-
ness chair, one after another, and affirmed that they lived
in the prisoner's election district, and had all cast their
ballots on election day for the Republican candidate. The
official count for that district, signed by the prisoner,
was then put in evidence, which read: Democratic
votes, 167; Republican, o. There were a number of
witnesses called by the defence who were Democrats.
The case began to take on a political aspect, which was
likely to result in a divided jury and no conviction, since
it had been shown that the prisoner had a most excellent
reputation and had never been suspected of wrong-doing
before. Finally the prisoner himself was sworn in his
own behalf.

It was the attempt of the cross-examiner to leave the
witness in such a position before the jury that no matter
what their politics might be, they could not avoid con-
victing him. There were but five questions asked.

_Counsel_. "You have told us, sir, that you have a wife
and seven children depending upon you for support. I
presume your desire is not to be obliged to leave them;
is it not?"

_Prisoner_. "Most assuredly, sir."

_Counsel_. "Apart from that consideration I presume
you have no particular desire to spend a term of years
in Sing Sing prison?"

_Prisoner_. "Certainly not, sir."

_Counsel_. "Well, you have heard twelve respectable
citizens take the witness-stand and swear they voted
the Republican ticket in your district, have you not?"

_Prisoner_. "Yes, sir."

_Counsel_ (pointing to the jury). "And you see these
twelve respectable gentlemen sitting here ready to pass
judgment upon the question of your liberty, do you
not?"

_Prisoner_. "I do, sir."

_Counsel_ (impressively, but quietly). "Well, now, Mr.
------, you will please explain to these twelve gentlemen
(pointing to jury) how it was that the ballots cast by the
other twelve gentlemen were not counted by you, and
then you can take your hat and walk right out of the
court room a free man."

The witness hesitated, cast down his eyes, but made
no answer --- and counsel sat down.

Of course a conviction followed. The prisoner was
sentenced to five years in state prison. During the
following few days nearly thirty defendants, indicted for
similar offences, pleaded guilty, and the entire work of
the court was completed within a few weeks. There
was not a single acquittal or disagreement.

Occasionally, when sufficient knowledge of facts about
the witness or about the details of his direct testimony
can be correctly anticipated, a trap may be set into
which even a clever witness, as in the illustration that
follows, will be likely to fall.

During the lifetime of Dr. J. W. Ranney there were
few physicians in this country who were so frequently
on the witness-stand, especially in damage suits.
So expert a witness had he become that Chief Justice
Van Brunt many years ago is said to have remarked,
"Any lawyer who attempts to cross-examine Dr. Ran-
ney is a fool." A case occurred a few years before Dr.
Ranney died, however, where a failure to cross-examine
would have been tantamount to a confession of judg-
ment, and the trial lawyer having the case in charge,
though fully aware of the dangers, was left no alterna-
tive, and as so often happens where "fools rush in,"
made one of those lucky "bull's eyes" that is perhaps
worth recording.

It was a damage case brought against the city by a
lady who, on her way from church one spring morning,
had tripped over an obscure encumbrance in the street,
and had, in consequence, been practically bedridden
for the three years leading up to the day of trial. She
was brought into the court room in a chair and was
placed in front of the jury, a pallid, pitiable object, sur-
rounded by her women friends, who acted upon this occa-
sion as nurses, constantly bathing her hands and face
with ill-smelling ointments, and administering restora.
tives, with marked effect upon the jury.

Her counsel, Ex-chief Justice Noah Davis, claimed
that her spine had been permanently injured, and asked
the jury for $50,000 damages.

It appeared that Dr. Ranney had been in constant
attendance upon the patient ever since the day of her
accident. He testified that he had visited her some
three hundred times and had examined her minutely at
least two hundred times in order to make up his mind
as to the absolutely correct diagnosis of her case, which
he was now thoroughly satisfied was one of genuine
disease of the spinal marrow itself. Judge Davis asked
him a few preliminary questions, and then gave the
doctor his head and let him “turn to the jury and tell
them all about it." Dr. Ranney spoke uninterruptedly
for nearly three-quarters of an hour. He described in
detail the sufferings of his patient since she had been
under his care; his efforts to relieve her pain; the hope-
less nature of her malady. He then proceeded in a
most impressive way to picture to the jury the gradual
and relentless progress of the disease as it assumed the
form of creeping paralysis, involving the destruction of
one organ after another until death became a blessed
relief. At the close of this recital, without a question
more, Judge Davis said in a calm but triumphant tone,
"Do you wish to cross-examine?"

Now the point in dispute --- there was no defence on
the merits --- was the nature of the patient's malady.
The city's medical witnesses were unanimous that the
lady had not, and could not have, contracted spinal dis-
ease from the slight injury she had received. They
styled her complaint as "hysterical," existing in the
patient's mind alone, and not indicating nor involving
a single diseased organ; but the jury evidently all be-
lieved Dr. Ranney, and were anxious to render a verdict
on his testimony. He must be cross-examined. Abso-
lute failure could be no worse than silence, though it
was evident that, along expected lines, questions relat-
ing to his direct evidence would be worse than useless.
Counsel was well aware of the doctor's reputed fertility
of resource, and quickly decided upon his tactics.

The cross-examiner first directed his questions toward
developing before the jury the fact that the witness had
been the medical expert for the New York, New Haven,
and Hartford R. R. thirty-five years, for the New York
Central R. R. forty years, for the New York and Har-
lem River R. R. twenty years, for the Erie R. R. fifteen
years, and so on until the doctor was forced to admit
that he was so much in court as a witness in defence of
these various railroads, and was so occupied with their
affairs that he had but comparatively little time to devote
to his reading and private practice.

_Counsel_ (perfectly quietly). "Are you able to give us,
doctor, the name of any medical authority that agrees
with you when you say that the particular group of
symptoms existing in this case points to one disease and
one only?"

_Doctor_. "Oh, yes, Dr. Ericson agrees with me."

_Counsel_. "Who is Dr. Ericson, if you please?"

_Doctor_ (with a patronizing smile). "Well, Mr.
Ericson was probably one of the most famous surgeons
that England has ever produced." (There was a titter
in the audience at the expense of counsel.)

_Counsel_. "What book has he written?"

_Doctor_ (still smiling). "He has written a book called
Ericson on the Spine,' which is altogether the best
known work on the subject." (The titter among the
audience grew louder.)

_Counsel_. "When was this book published?"

_Doctor_. "About ten years ago."

_Counsel_. "Well, how is it that a man whose time is
so much occupied as you have told us yours is, has
leisure enough to look up medical authorities to see if
they agree with him?"

_Doctor_ (fairly beaming on counsel). "Well, Mr. ------,
to tell you the truth, I have often heard of you, and I
half suspected you would ask me some such foolish ques-
tion; so this morning after my breakfast, and before
starting for court, I took down from my library my copy
of Ericson's book, and found that he agreed entirely with
my diagnosis in this case." (Loud laughter at expense
of counsel, in which the jury joined.)

_Counsel_ (reaching under the counsel table and taking
up his own copy of "Ericson on the Spine," and walking
deliberately up to the witness). "Won't you be good
enough to point out to me where Ericson adopts your
view of this case?"

_Doctor_ (embarrassed). "Oh, I can't do it now; it is a
very thick book."

_Counsel_ (still holding out the book to the witness).
"But you forget, doctor, that thinking I might ask you
some such foolish question, you examined your volume of
Ericson this very morning after breakfast and before
coming to court."

_Doctor_ (becoming more embarrassed and still refusing
to take the book). "I have not time to do it now."

_Counsel_. "Time! why there is all the time in the
world."

_Doctor_. (no answer).

_Counsel_ and witness eye each other closely.

_Counsel_ (sitting down, still eying witness). “I am sure
the court will allow me to suspend my examination until
you shall have had time to turn to the place you read
this morning in that book, and can reread it now aloud
to the jury."

_Doctor_ (no answer).

The court room was in deathly silence for fully three
minutes. The witness _wouldn't_ say anything, counsel
for plaintiff _didn't dare_ to say anything, and counsel for
the city _didn't want_ to say anything; he saw that he
had caught the witness in a manifest falsehood, and that
the doctor's whole testimony was discredited with the
jury unless he could open to the paragraph referred to
which counsel well knew did not exist in the whole work
of Ericson.

At the expiration of a few minutes, Mr. Justice
Barrett, who was presiding at the trial, turned quietly to
the witness and asked him if he desired to answer the
question, and upon his replying that he did not intend to
answer it any further than he had already done, he was
excused from the witness-stand amid almost breathless
silence in the court room. As he passed from the wit-
ness chair to his seat, he stooped and whispered into the
ear of counsel, "You are the -----est most impertinent
man I have ever met."

After a ten days' trial the jury were unable to forget
the collapse of the plaintiff's principal witness, and failed
to agree upon a verdict.
