## THE MATTER OF CROSS-EXAMINATION

If by experience we have learned the first lesson of
our art, ---to control our _manner_ toward the witness even
under the most trying circumstances, --- it then becomes
important that we should turn our attention to the
_matter_ of our cross-examination. By our manner toward
him we may have in a measure disarmed him, or at least
put him off his guard, while his memory and conscience
are being ransacked by subtle and searching questions,
the scope of which shall be hardly apparent to himself ;
but it is only with the matter of our cross-examination
that we can hope to destroy him.

What shall be our first mode of attack? Shall we
adopt the fatal method of those we see around us daily
in the courts, and proceed to take the witness over the
same story that he has already given our adversary, in
the absurd hope that he is going to change it in the
repetition, and not retell it with double effect upon the
jury? Or shall we rather avoid carefully his original
story, except in so far as is necessary to refer to it in
order to point out its weak spots? Whatever we do,
let us do it with quiet dignity, with absolute fairness to
the witness; and let us frame our questions in such sim
ple language that there can be no misunderstanding or
confusion. Let us imagine ourselves in the jury box, so
that we may see the evidence from their standpoint. We
are not trying to make a reputation for ourselves with
the audience as "smart" cross-examiners. We are think-
ing rather of our client and our employment by him to
win the jury upon his side of the case. Let us also avoid
asking questions recklessly, without any definite purpose.
Unskilful questions are worse than none at all, and only
tend to uphold rather than to destroy the witness.

All through the direct testimony of our imaginary wit-
ness, it will be remembered, we were watching his every
movement and expression. Did we find an opening for
our cross-examination? Did we detect the weak spot in
his narrative? If so, let us waste no time, but go direct
to the point. It may be that the witness's situation in
respect to the parties or the subject-matter of the suit
should be disclosed to the jury, as one reason why his
testimony has been shaded somewhat in favor of the side
on which he testifies. It may be that he has a direct
interest in the result of the litigation, or is to receive
some indirect benefit therefrom. Or he may have some
other tangible motive which he can gently be made to
disclose. Perhaps the witness is only suffering from
that partisanship, so fatal to fair evidence, of which often-
times the witness himself is not conscious. It may even
be that, if the jury only knew the scanty means the wit-
ness has had for obtaining a correct and certain knowl-
edge of the very facts to which he has sworn so glibly,
aided by the adroit questioning of the opposing counsel,
this in itself would go far toward weakening the effect
of his testimony. It may appear, on the other hand,
that the witness had the best possible opportunity to
observe the facts he speaks of, but had not the intelli-
gence to observe these facts correctly. Two people may
witness the same occurrence and yet take away with
them an entirely different impression of it; but each,
when called to the witness stand, may be willing to swear
to that impression as a fact. Obviously, both accounts
of the same transaction cannot be true; whose impres-
sions were wrong? Which had the better opportunity
to see? Which had the keener power of perception?
All this we may very properly term the matter of our
cross-examination.

It is one thing to have the opportunity of observation,
or even the intelligence to observe correctly, but it is still
another to be able to retain accurately, for any length of
time, what we have once seen or heard, and what is per-
haps more difficult still--- to be able to describe it intelli-
gibly. Many witnesses have seen one part of a transaction
and heard about another part, and later on become con-
fused in their own minds, or perhaps only in their modes
of expression, as to what they have seen themselves and
what they have heard from others. All witnesses are
prone to exaggerate --- to enlarge or minimize the facts
to which they take oath.

A very common type of witness, met with almost
daily, is the man who, having witnessed some event
years ago, suddenly finds that he is to be called as a
court witness. He immediately attempts to recall his
original impressions; and gradually, as he talks with the
attorney who is to examine him, he amplifies his story
with new details which he leads himself, or is led, to
believe are recollections and which he finally swears to
as facts. Many people seem to fear that an “I don't
know” answer will be attributed to ignorance on their
part. Although perfectly honest in intention, they are
apt, in consequence, to complete their story by recourse
to their imagination. And few witnesses fail, at least
in some part of their story, to entangle facts with their
own beliefs and inferences.

All these considerations should readily suggest a line
of questions, varying with each witness examined, that
will, if closely followed, be likely to separate appearance
from reality and to reduce exaggerations to their proper
proportions. It must further be borne in mind that the
jury should not merely see the mistake; they should be
made to appreciate at the time why and whence it arose.
It is fresher then and makes a more lasting effect than
if left until the summing up, and then drawn to the
attention of the jury.

The experienced examiner can usually tell, after a few
simple questions, what line to pursue. Picture the scene
in your own mind; closely inquire into the sources of
the witness's information, and draw your own conclusions
as to how his mistake arose, and why he formed his
erroneous impressions. Exhibit plainly your belief in
his integrity and your desire to be fair with him, and try
to beguile him into being candid with you. Then when
the particular foible which has affected his testimony has
once been discovered, he can easily be led to expose it
to the jury. His mistakes should be drawn out often by
inference rather than by direct question, because all wit-
nesses have a dread of self-contradiction. If he sees the
connection between your inquiries and his own story, he
will draw upon his imagination for explanations, before
you get the chance to point out to him the inconsistency
between his later statement and his original one. It is
often wise to break the effect of a witness's story by put-
ting questions to him that will acquaint the jury at once
with the fact that there is another more probable story
to be told later on, to disclose to them something of the
defence, as it were. Avoid the mistake, so common
among the inexperienced, of making much of trifling
discrepancies. It has been aptly said that "juries have
no respect for small triumphs over a witness's self-posses-
sion or memory." Allow the loquacious witness to talk
on; he will be sure to involve himself in difficulties from
which he can never extricate himself. Some witnesses
prove altogether too much; encourage them and lead
them by degrees into exaggerations that will conflict
with the common sense of the jury. Under no circum-
stances put a false construction on the words of a witness;
there are few faults in an advocate more fatal with a
jury.

If, perchance, you obtain a really favorable answer,
leave it and pass quietly to some other inquiry. The
inexperienced examiner in all probability will repeat the
question with the idea of impressing the admission upon
his hearers, instead of reserving it for the summing up,
and will attribute it to bad luck that his witness corrects
his answer or modifies it in some way, so that the point
is lost. He is indeed a poor judge of human nature
who supposes that if he exults over his success during
the cross-examination, he will not quickly put the witness
on his guard to avoid all future favorable disclosures.

David Graham, a prudent and successful cross-exam-
iner, once said, perhaps more in jest than anything else,
A lawyer should never ask a witness on cross-examina-
tion a question unless in the first place he knew what
the answer would be, or in the second place he didn't
care." This is something on the principle of the lawyer
who claimed that the result of most trials depended upon
which side perpetrated the greatest blunders in cross-
examination. Certainly no lawyer should ask a _critical_
question unless he is sure of the answer.

Mr. Sergeant Ballantine, in his “Experiences," quotes
an instance in the trial of a prisoner on the charge of
homicide, where a once famous English barrister had
been induced by the urgency of an attorney, although
against his own judgment, to ask a question on cross-
examination, the answer to which convicted his client.
Upon receiving the answer, he turned to the attorney who
had advised him to ask it, and said, emphasizing every
word, "Go home; cut your throat; and when you meet
your client in hell, beg his pardon."

It is well, sometimes, in a case where you believe that
the witness is reluctant to develop the whole truth, so to
put questions that the answers you know will be elicited
may come by way of a surprise and in the light of im-
probability to the jury. I remember a recent incident,
illustrative of this point, which occurred in a suit brought
to recover the insurance on a large warehouse full of
goods that had been burnt to the ground. The insur-
ance companies had been unable to find any stock-book
which would show the amount of goods in stock at the
time of the fire. One of the witnesses to the fire hap-
pened to be the plaintiff's bookkeeper, who on the direct
examination testified to all the details of the fire, but
nothing about the books. The cross-examination was
confined to these few pointed questions.

"I suppose you had an iron safe in your office, in
which you kept your books of account?" "Yes, sir."---
"Did that burn up?" "Oh, no."---"Were you present
when it was opened after the fire?" "Yes, sir." --- “ Then
won't you be good enough to hand me the stock-book
that we may show the jury exactly what stock you had
on hand at the time of the fire on which you claim loss ?`
(This was the point of the case and the jury were not
prepared for the answer which followed.) I haven't
it, sir."---"What, haven't the stock-book? You don't
mean you have lost it?" "It wasn't in the safe, sir.".---
"Wasn't that the proper place for it?" "Yes, sir.".---
How was it that the book wasn't there?" "It had
evidently been left out the night before the fire by mis-
take." Some of the jury at once drew the inference
that the all-important stock-book was being suppressed,
and refused to agree with their fellows against the insur-
ance companies.

The average mind is much wiser than many suppose.
Questions can be put to a witness under cross-examination,
in argumentative form, often with far greater effect upon
the minds of the jury than if the same line of reasoning
were reserved for the summing up. The juryman sees
the point for himself, as if it were his own discovery, and
clings to it all the more tenaciously. During the cross-
examination of Henry Ward Beecher, in the celebrated
Tilton-Beecher case, and after Mr. Beecher had denied
his alleged intimacy with Mr. Tilton's wife, Judge Ful-
lerton read a passage from one of Mr. Beecher's sermons
to the effect that if a person commits a great sin, the
exposure of which would cause misery to others, such a
person would not be justified in confessing it, merely
to relieve his own conscience. Fullerton then looked
straight into Mr. Beecher's eyes and said, “Do you still
consider that sound doctrine?" Mr. Beecher replied,
"I do." The inference a juryman might draw from this
question and answer would constitute a subtle argument
upon that branch of the case.

The entire effect of the testimony of an adverse wit-
ness can sometimes be destroyed by a pleasant little
passage-at-arms in which he is finally held up to ridicule
before the jury, and all that he has previously said against
you disappears in the laugh that accompanies him from
the witness box. In a recent Metropolitan Street Rail-
way case a witness who had been badgered rather per-
sistently on cross-examination, finally straightened himself
up in the witness chair and said pertly, “I have not come
here asking you to _play with me_. Do you take me for
Anna Held?"42/1 “I was not thinking of Anna Held,” re-
plied the counsel quietly; "supposing you try Ananias!"
The witness was enraged, the jury laughed, and the
lawyer, who had really made nothing out of the witness
up to this time, sat down.

These little triumphs are, however, by no means always
one-sided. Often, if the counsel gives him an opening, a
clever witness will counter on him in a most humiliating
fashion, certain to meet with the hearty approval of jury
and audience. At the Worcester Assizes, in England, a
case was being tried which involved the soundness of a
horse, and a clergyman had been called as a witness who
succeeded only in giving a rather confused account of
the transaction. A blustering counsel on the other side,
after many attempts to get at the facts upon cross-
examination, blurted out, "Pray, sir, do you know the
difference between a horse and a cow?' I acknowledge
my ignorance," replied the clergyman; "I hardly do know
the difference between a horse and a cow, or between a
bull and a bully --- only a bull, I am told, has horns, and
a bully (bowing respectfully to the counsel), _luckily for
me_, has none."43/1 Reference is made in a subsequent
chapter to the cross-examination of Dr. ------ in the
Carlyle Harris case, where is related at length a striking
example of success in this method of examination.

42/1 This occurrence was at the time when the actress Anna Held was singing
her popular stage song, "Won't you come and play with me."




It may not be uninteresting to record in this connec-
tion one or two cases illustrative of matter that is valu-
able in cross-examination in personal damage suits
where the sole object of counsel is to reduce the amount
of the jury's verdict, and to puncture the pitiful tale of
suffering told by the plaintiff in such cases.

A New York commission merchant, named Metts,
sixty-six years of age, was riding in a Columbus Avenue
open car. As the car neared the curve at Fifty-third
Street and Seventh Avenue, and while he was in the act
of closing an open window in the front of the car at the
request of an old lady passenger, the car gave a sudden,
violent lurch, and he was thrown into the street, receiv
ing injuries from which, at the time of the trial, he had
suffered for three years.

43/1 " Curiosities of Law and Lawyers."



Counsel for the plaintiff went into his client's suffer-
ings in great detail. Plaintiff had had concussion of the
brain, loss of memory, bladder difficulties, a broken leg,
nervous prostration, constant pain in his back. And the
attempt to alleviate the pain attendant upon all these
difficulties was gone into with great detail. To cap all,
the attending physician had testified that the reasonable
value of his professional services was the modest sum of
$2500.

Counsel for the railroad, before cross-examining, had
made a critical examination of the doctor's face and bear-
ing in the witness chair, and had concluded that, if pleas-
antly handled, he could be made to testify pretty nearly
to the truth, whatever it might be. He concluded to
spar for an opening, and it came within the first half-
dozen questions:---

_Counsel_. "What medical name, doctor, would you give
to the plaintiff's present ailment?"

_Doctor_. "He has what is known as 'traumatic microsis.'

_Counsel_. "Microsis, doctor? That means, does it not,
the habit, or disease as you may call it, of making much
of ailments that an ordinary healthy man would pass by
as of no account?"

_Doctor_. "That is right, sir."

_Counsel_ (smiling). "I hope you haven't got this dis-
ease, doctor, have you?"

_Doctor_. "Not that I am aware of, sir."

_Counsel_. Then we ought to be able to get a very
fair statement from you of this man's troubles, ought we
not?"

_Doctor_. "I hope so, sir."

The opening had been found; witness was already
flattered into agreeing with all suggestions, and warned
against exaggeration.

_Counsel_. "Let us take up the bladder trouble first.
Do not practically all men who have reached the age of
sixty-six have troubles of one kind or another that result
in more or less irritation of the bladder?"

_Doctor_. "Yes, that is very common with old men.

_Counsel_. "You said Mr. Metts was deaf in one ear.
I noticed that he seemed to hear the questions asked him
in court particularly well; did you notice it?"

_Doctor_. "I did."

_Counsel_. "At the age of sixty-six are not the majority
of men gradually failing in their hearing?"

_Doctor_. Yes, sir, frequently.”

_Counsel_. "Frankly, doctor, don't you think this man
hears remarkably well for his age, leaving out the deaf
ear altogether?"

_Doctor_. "I think he does."

_Counsel_ (keeping the ball rolling). "I don't think you
have even the first symptoms of this 'traumatic microsis,'
doctor."

_Doctor_ (pleased). "I haven't got it at all."

_Counsel_. " You said Mr. Metts had had concussion of
the brain. Has not every boy who has fallen over back-
ward, when skating on the ice, and struck his head, also
had what you physicians would call 'concussion of the
brain'?"

_Doctor_. "Yes, sir."

_Counsel_. "But I understood you to say that this
plaintiff had had, in addition, hæmorrhages of the brain.
Do you mean to tell us that he could have had hæmor-
rhages of the brain and be alive to-day? '

_Doctor_. "They were microscopic hæmorrhages."

_Counsel_. "That is to say, one would have to take a
microscope to find them?"

_Doctor_.
That is right."

_Counsel_. "You do not mean us to understand, doc-
tor, that you have not cured him of these microscopic
hæmorrhages?"

_Doctor_. "I have cured him; that is right."

_Counsel_. "You certainly were competent to set his
broken leg or you wouldn't have attempted it; did you
get a good union?"

_Doctor_. "Yes, he has got a good, strong, healthy
leg."

Counsel having elicited, by the "smiling method," all
the required admissions, suddenly changed his whole
bearing toward the witness, and continued pointedly:---

_Counsel_. "And you said that $2500 would be a fair
and reasonable charge for your services. It is three
years since Mr. Metts was injured. Have you sent him
no bill?"

_Doctor_. "Yes, sir, I have."

_Counsel_. "Let me see it. (Turning to plaintiff's
counsel.) Will either of you let me have the bill?"

_Doctor_. "I haven't it, sir."

_Counsel_ (astonished). What was the amount of it?"

_Doctor_. "$1000."

_Counsel_ (savagely). "Why do you charge the railroad
company two and a half times as much as you charge
the patient himself?

_Doctor_ (embarrassed at this sudden change on part
of counsel). "You asked me what my services were
worth."

_Counsel_. Didn't you charge your patient the full
worth of your services?

_Doctor_ (no answer).

_Counsel_ (quickly). “How much have you been paid
on your bill - on your oath?"

_Doctor_. "He paid me $100 at one time, that is, two
years ago; and at two different times since he has paid
me $30."

_Counsel_. "And he is a rich commission merchant
down town!" (And with something between a sneer
and a laugh counsel sat down.)

An amusing incident, leading to the exposure of a
manifest fraud, occurred recently in another of the many
damage suits brought against the Metropolitan Street
Railway and growing out of a collision between two of
the company's electric cars.

The plaintiff, a laboring man, had been thrown to the
street pavement from the platform of the car by the
force of the collision, and had dislocated his shoulder.
He had testified in his own behalf that he had been
permanently injured in so far as he had not been able
to follow his usual employment for the reason that he
could not raise his arm above a point parallel with his
shoulder. Upon cross-examination the attorney for the
railroad asked the witness a few sympathetic questions
about his sufferings, and upon getting on a friendly
basis with him asked him “to be good enough to show
the jury the extreme limit to which he could raise his
arm since the accident." The plaintiff slowly and with
considerable difficulty raised his arm to the parallel of
his shoulder. "Now, using the same arm, show the
jury how high you could get it up before the accident,"
quietly continued the attorney; whereupon the witness
extended his arm to its full height above his head, amid
peals of laughter from the court and jury.

In a case of murder, to which the defence of insanity
was set up, a medical witness called on behalf of the
accused swore that in his opinion the accused, at the
time he killed the deceased, was affected with a homi-
cidal mania, and urged to the act by an _irresistible_ im-
pulse. The judge, not satisfied with this, first put the
witness some questions on other subjects, and then
asked, “Do you think the accused would have acted as
he did if a policeman had been present?" to which the
witness at once answered in the negative. Thereupon
the judge remarked, “Your definition of an irresistible
impulse must then be an impulse irresistible at all times
except when a policeman is present."
