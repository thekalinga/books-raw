## THE SEQUENCE OF CROSS-EXAMINATION

MUCH depends upon the _sequence_ in which one con-
ducts the cross-examination of a dishonest witness. You
should never hazard the important question until you
have laid the foundation for it in such a way that, when
confronted with the fact, the witness can neither deny
nor explain it. One often sees the most damaging docu-
mentary evidence, in the form of letters or affidavits, fall
absolutely flat as exponents of falsehood, merely because
of the unskilful way in which they are handled. If you
have in your possession a letter written by the witness,
in which he takes an opposite position on some part of
the case to the one he has just sworn to, avoid the com-
mon error of showing the witness the letter for identifica-
tion, and then reading it to him with the inquiry, “What
have you to say to that?" During the reading of his
letter the witness will be collecting his thoughts and get-
ting ready his explanations in anticipation of the ques-
tion that is to follow, and the effect of the damaging letter
will be lost.

The correct method of using such a letter is to lead
the witness quietly into repeating the statements he has
made in his direct testimony, and which his letter contra-
dicts. "I have you down as saying so and so; will you
please repeat it? I am apt to read my notes to the jury,
and I want to be accurate." The witness will repeat his
statement. Then write it down and read it off to him.
Is that correct? Is there any doubt about it? For if
you have any explanation or qualification to make, I think
you owe it to us, in justice, to make it before I leave the
subject." The witness has none. He has stated the
fact; there is nothing to qualify; the jury rather like
his straightforwardness. Then let your whole manner
toward him suddenly change, and spring the letter upon
him. "Do you recognize your own handwriting, sir?
Let me read you from your own letter, in which you say,"
---and afterward--- Now, what have you to say to that ? ”
You will make your point in such fashion that the jury
will not readily forget it. It is usually expedient, when
you have once made your point, to drop it and go to
something else, lest the witness wriggle out of it. But
when you have a witness under oath, who is orally con-
tradicting a statement he has previously made, when not
under oath, but in his own handwriting, you then have
him fast on the hook, and there is no danger of his get-
ting away; now is the time to press your advantage.
Put his self-contradictions to him in as many forms as
you can invent:---

"Which statement is true?" "Had you forgotten this
letter when you gave your testimony to-day?" Did
you tell your counsel about it?" "Were you intending
to deceive him?” What was your object in trying to
mislead the jury?"120/1

"Some men,” said a London barrister who often saw
Sir Charles Russell in action, "get in a bit of the nail,
and there they leave it hanging loosely about until the
judge or some one else pulls it out. But when Russell
got in a bit of the nail, he never stopped until he drove
it home. No man ever pulled _that_ nail out again."

Sometimes it is advisable to deal the witness a sting-
ing blow with your first few questions; this, of course,
assumes that you have the material with which to do it.
The advantage of putting your best point forward at the
very start is twofold. First, the jury have been listening
to his direct testimony and have been forming their own
impressions of him, and when you rise to cross-examine,
they are keen for your first questions. If you "land
one" in the first bout, it makes far more impression on
the jury than if it came later on when their attention has
begun to lag, and when it might only appear as a chance
shot. The second, and perhaps more important, effect
of scoring on the witness with the first group of ques-
tions is that it makes him afraid of you and less hostile
in his subsequent answers, not knowing when you will
trip him again and give him another fall. This will often
enable you to obtain from him truthful answers on sub-
jects about which you are not prepared to contradict
him.


120/1 In Chapter XI (infra) is given in detail the cross-examination of the
witness Pigott by Sir Charles Russell, which affords a most striking example
of the most effective use that can be made of an incriminating letter.

I have seen the most determined witness completely
lose his presence of mind after two or three well-directed
blows given at the very start of his cross-examination,
and become as docile in the examiner's hands as if he
were his own witness. This is the time to lead the wit-
ness back to his original story and give him the oppor-
tunity to tone it down or retint it, as it were; possibly
even to switch him over until he finds himself supporting
your side of the controversy. This taming of a hostile
witness, and forcing him to tell the truth against his will,
is one of the triumphs of the cross-examiner's art. In a
speech to the jury, Choate once said of such a witness,
"I brand him a vagabond and a villain; they brought
him to curse, and, behold, he hath blessed us alto-
gether."

Some witnesses, under this style of examination, lose
their tempers completely, and if the examiner only keeps
his own and puts his questions rapidly enough, he will
be sure to lead the witness into such a web of contradic-
tions as entirely to discredit him with any fair-minded
jury. A witness, in anger, often forgets himself and
speaks the truth. His passion benumbs his power to
deceive. Still another sort of witness displays his tem-
per on such occasions by becoming sullen; he begins by
giving evasive answers, and ends by refusing to answer
at all. He might as well go a little farther and admit
his perjury at once, so far as the effect on the jury is
concerned.

When, however, you have not the material at hand
with which to frighten the witness into correcting his
perjured narrative, and yet you have concluded that a
cross-examination is necessary, never waste time by
putting questions which will enable him to repeat his
original testimony in the sequence in which he first gave
it. You can accomplish nothing with him unless you
abandon the train of ideas he followed in giving his main
story. Select the weakest points of his testimony and
the attendant circumstances he would be least likely to
prepare for. Do not ask your questions in logical order,
lest he invent conveniently as he goes along; but dodge
him about in his story and pin him down to precise
answers on all the accidental circumstances indirectly
associated with his main narrative. As he begins to invent
his answers, put your questions more rapidly, asking
many unimportant ones to one important one, and all
in the same voice. If he is not telling the truth, and
answering from memory and associated ideas rather than
from imagination, he will never be able to invent his
answers as quickly as you can frame your questions, and
at the same time correctly estimate the bearing his pres-
ent answer may have upon those that have preceded it.
If you have the requisite skill to pursue this method of
questioning, you will be sure to land him in a maze of
self-contradictions from which he will never be able to
extricate himself.

Some witnesses, though unwilling to perjure them-
selves, are yet determined not to tell the _whole_ truth if
they can help it, owing to some personal interest in, or
relationship to, the party on whose behalf they are called
to testify. If you are instructed that such a witness (gen-
erally a woman) is in possession of the fact you want and
can help you if she chooses, it is your duty to draw it out
of her. This requires much patience and ingenuity.
If you put the direct question to her at once, you will
probably receive a "don't remember" answer, or she may
even indulge her conscience in a mental reservation and
pretend a willingness but inability to answer. You must
approach the subject by slow stages. Begin with matters
remotely connected with the important fact you are aim-
ing at. She will relate these, not perhaps realizing on
the spur of the moment exactly where they will lead her.
Having admitted that much, you can lead her nearer
and nearer by successive approaches to the gist of the
matter, until you have her in such a dilemma that she
must either tell you what she had intended to conceal
or else openly commit perjury. When she leaves the
witness-chair, you can almost hear her whisper to her
friends, “I never intended to tell it, but that man put me
in such a position I simply had to tell or admit that I
was lying."

In all your cross-examinations never lose control of
the witness; confine his answers to the exact questions
you ask. He will try to dodge direct answers, or if
forced to answer directly, will attempt to add a qualifica-
tion or an explanation which will rob his answer of the
benefit it might otherwise be to you. And lastly, most
important of all, let me repeat the injunction to be ever
on the alert for a _good place to stop_. Nothing can be
more important than to close your examination with a
triumph. So many lawyers succeed in catching a wit-
ness in a serious contradiction; but, not satisfied with
this, go on asking questions, and taper off their exami-
nation until the effect upon the jury of their former
advantage is lost altogether. "Stop with a victory" is
one of the maxims of cross-examination. If you have
done nothing more than to expose an attempt to deceive
on the part of the witness, you have gone a long way
toward discrediting him with your jury. Jurymen are
apt to regard a witness as a whole--- either they believe
him or they don't. If they distrust him, they are likely
to disregard his testimony altogether, though much of it
may have been true. The fact that remains uppermost
in their minds is that he attempted to deceive them, or
that he left the witness-stand with a lie upon his lips, or
after he had displayed his ignorance to such an extent
that the entire audience laughed at him. Thereafter
his evidence is dismissed from the case so far as they
are concerned.

Erskine once wasted a whole day in trying to expose
to a jury the lack of mental balance of a witness, until
a physician who was assisting him suggested that Erskine
ask the witness whether he did not believe himself to be
Jesus Christ. This question was put by Erskine very
cautiously and with studied humility, accompanied by a
request for forgiveness for the indecency of the question.
The witness, who was at once taken unawares, amid
breathless silence and with great solemnity exclaimed,
"I am the Christ"--- which soon ended the case.125/1
