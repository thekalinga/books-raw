## THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF MISS MARTINEZ BY HON. JOSEPH H. CHOATE IN THE CELEBRATED BREACH OF PROMISE CASE, MARTINEZ _V._ DEL VALLE

THE modern method of studying any subject, or
acquiring any art, is the inductive method. This is
illustrated in our law schools, where to a large extent
actual cases are studied in order to get at the principles
of law instead of acquiring those principles solely through
the _a priori_ method of the study of text-books.

As already indicated, this method is also the only
way to become a master of the art of cross-examination.
In addition to actual personal experience, however, it is
important to study the methods of great cross-examiners,
or those whose extended experience makes them safe
guides to follow.

Hence, the writer believes, it would be decidedly
helpful to the students of the art of cross-examination
to have placed before them in a convenient and some-
what condensed form, some good illustrations of the
methods of well-known cross-examiners, as exhibited in
actual practice, in the cross-examination of important
witnesses in famous trials.

For these reasons, and the further one that such ex-
amples are interesting as a study of human nature, I
have in the following pages introduced the cross-exami-
nation of some important witnesses in several remarkable
trials.

Often when it is necessary to demonstrate the fact
that a witness has given colored or false testimony, it is
not some effective point that is the true test of a great
cross-examination, but the general effect which is pro-
duced upon a jury by a long review of all the witness
has said, bringing out inconsistencies, contradictions,
and improbable situations which result finally in the
breakdown of the witness's story. The brief extracts
from the cross-examinations that have already been
given will not fully illustrate this branch of the cross-
examiner's work.

Really great triumphs in the art of cross-examination
are but seldom achieved. They occur far less frequently
than great speeches. All of us who attend the courts
are now and then delighted with a burst of eloquence,
but we may haunt them for years and never hear any-
thing even faintly approaching a great cross-examina-
tion; yet few pleasures exceed that afforded by its
successful application in the detection of fraud or the
vindication of innocence.

Some of the greatest cross-examinations in the history
of the courts become almost unintelligible in print. The
reader nowadays must fancy in vain such triumphs as
those attained by Lord Brougham in his cross-examina-
tion of the Italian witness Majocchi, in the trial of Queen
Caroline. To a long succession of questions respecting
matters of which he quite obviously had a lively recollec-
tion, the only answer to be obtained on cross-exami-
nation from this witness was _Non mi recordo_ (I do not
remember).

Seventy years ago this cross-examination was reputed
the greatest masterpiece of forensic skill in the history
of the world," and _Non mi recordo_ became household
words in England for denoting _mendacity_. Almost
equally famous was the cross-examination of Louise
Demont by Williams, in the same trial. And yet noth-
ing could be less interesting or less instructive, perhaps,
than the perusal in print of these two examinations,
robbed as they now are of all the stirring interest they
possessed at the time when England's queen was on
trial charged with adulterous relations with her Italian
_courier de place_.

Much that goes to make up an oration dies with its
author and the event that called it into being. Likewise
the manner of the cross-examiner, the attitude of the
witness, and the dramatic quality of the scene, cannot
be reproduced in print.

In order to appreciate thoroughly the examples of suc-
cessful cross-examinations which here follow, the reader
must give full vent to his imagination. He must try to
picture to himself the crowded court room, the excite-
ment, the hush, the expectancy, the eager faces, the
silence and dignity of the court, if he wishes to realize
even faintly the real spirit of the occasion.

### MARTINEZ _v._ DEL VALLE

One of the most brilliant trials in the annals of the
New York courts was the celebrated action for breach
of promise of marriage brought by Miss Eugénie
Martinez against Juan del Valle. The cross-examina-
tion of the plaintiff in this case was conducted by the
Hon. Joseph H. Choate, and is considered by lawyers
who heard it as perhaps the most brilliant piece of work
of the kind Mr. Choate ever did.212/1

The case was called for trial in the Supreme Court,
New York County, before Mr. Justice Donohue, on the
fourteenth of January, 1875. The plaintiff was repre-
sented by Mr. William A. Beach, and Mr. Choate ap-
peared for the defendant, Mr. del Valle. The trial lasted
for a week and was the occasion of great excitement
among the habitués of the court-house. To quote from
the daily press, "All those who cannot find seats within
the court room, remain standing throughout the entire
day in the halls, with the faint hope of catching a sight
of the famous plaintiff, whose beauty and grace has at-
tracted admirers by the score, from every stage of society,
who haunt the place regardless of inconvenience or
decency."

212/1 When Mr. Choate retired from practice his court records had become so
voluminous that many of them were destroyed, including all record of this
trial. Both of the court stenographers who reported the trial have since died.
Mr. Beach's recollection of the case had died with him and all his notes had
likewise been destroyed. It was by the merest accident that a full transcript
of the stenographic minutes of the trial was discovered in the possession of a
former friend and legal representative of the defendant.


There is no more popular occasion in a court room
than the trial of a breach of promise case, and none
more interesting to a jury. Such cases always afford
the greatest satisfaction to an eager public who come to
witness the conflict between the lawyers and to listen to
the cross-examinations and speeches. With Mr. Beach,
fresh from his nine days' oration in the Henry Ward
Beecher case, pitted against Mr. Choate, who told the
jury that this was his first venture in this region of the
law; and with a really beautiful Spanish woman just
twenty-one years of age, "with raven black hair and
melting eyes shadowed by long, graceful lashes, the
complexion of a peach, and a form ravishing to con-
template," suing a rich middle-aged Cuban banker for
$50,000 damages for seduction and breach of promise
of marriage, the intensity of the public interest on
this particular occasion can be readily imagined, and
served as a stimulus to both counsel to put forth their
grandest efforts.

The plaintiff and defendant were strangers until the
day when she had slipped on the ice, and had fallen in
front of the Gilsey House on the corner of 29th Street
and Broadway. Mr. del Valle had rushed to her assis-
tance, had lifted her to her feet, conducted her to her
home, received the permission of her mother to become
her friend, and six months later had become the defend-
ant in this notorious suit which he had tried to avoid by
offering the plaintiff $20,000 not to bring it into court.

Mr. Choate spoke of it to the jury as an excellent illus-
tration of the folly, in these modern times, of attempting
to raise a fallen woman! To quote his exact words:---

>Now I want to speak a word of warning to all Good
Samaritans, if there are any in the jury box, against this
practice of going to the rescue of fallen women on the
sidewalks. I do not think my client will ever do it
again. I do not think anybody connected with the
administration of justice in this case will ever again go
to the relief of one of our fair fallen sisters under such
circumstances. I know the parable of the Good Samari-
tan is held up as an example for Christian conduct and
action to all good people, but, gentlemen, it does not
apply to this case, because it was 'a certain man' who
went down to Jericho and fell among thieves, and not
a woman, and the Good Samaritan himself was of the
same sex, and there is not a word of injunction upon any
of us to go to the rescue of a person of the other sex
if she slips upon the ice. Why, gentlemen, that is an
historical trick of the 'nymphs of the pave.' Hundreds
of times has it been practised upon the verdant and
inexperienced stranger in our great city.

Mr. Choate felt that he had a good case, a perfectly
clear case, but that there was one obstacle in it which
he could not overcome. There was a beautiful woman
in the case against him, “a combination of beauty and
eloquence which would outweigh any facts that might
be brought before a jury."

Very early in the trial Mr. Choate warned the jury
against the seductive eloquence and power of the learned
counsel whom the plaintiff had enlisted in her behalf,---
"one of the veterans of our Bar, of whose talents and
achievements the whole profession is proud. In that
branch of jurisprudence which I may call _sexual_ ga-
tion he is without a peer or a rival, from his long expe-
rience! You can no more help being swayed by his
eloquence than could the rocks and the trees help
following the lyre of Orpheus!”

When it came Mr. Beach's turn to address the jury
he replied to this sally of Choate's:---

>During the progress of this trial, counsel has seen
>fit to make some personal allusions to myself. (Here
>Mr. Choate faced around.) It seemed to me not con-
>ceived in an entirely courteous spirit. He belabored
>me with compliments so extravagant and fulsome that
>they assumed the character of irony and satire. It is
>a common trick of the forum to excite expectations
>which the speaker knows will not be gratified, and blunt
>even the force of plain and simple arguments which may
>be addressed to the jury. The courtesy of the learned
>counsel requires a fitting acknowledgment, and yet I
>confess my utter inability to do it. I lack the language
>to delineate in proper colors the brilliant faculties of the
>learned gentleman, and I am perforce driven to borrow
>from others the words which describe him properly. I
>know no other source more likely to do the gentleman
>justice than the learned and accomplished friends among
>us taking notes. I noticed a description of my learned
>friend so appropriate and just that I adopt the language
>of it. (Here counsel read.) The eloquent and witty
>Choate sat with his classic head erect, while over his
>Cupid features his blue eyes shed a mild light.' (Great
>laughter.) Allow me to tender it to you, sir. (Mr. Choate
>smilingly accepted the newspaper clipping.)
>
>And how completely does my learned friend fulfil
>this description! How like a god he is! What beauty!
>The gloss of fashion and the mould of form! \[_Laughter_.\]
>The observed of all observers! Why, how can I under-
>take to contend with such a heaven-descended god!
>\[_Laughter_.\] He chooses to attribute to me something
>of Orpheonic enchantments, but should I attempt to
>imitate the fabled musician, sure I am I could not touch
>his heart of stone! But he strikes the Orpheonic lyre
>which he brings with him from the celestial habitation.
>How can you resist him? What hope have I with like
>weapons or efforts? If the case of this poor and crushed
>girl depends on any contest of wit or words between the
>counsel and myself, how hopeless it is; and yet I have
>some homely words, some practical facts and considera-
>tions to address to your understandings, which I hope
>and believe will reach your conviction.

Miss Martinez took the witness-stand in her own
behalf and told her story:---

>I became acquainted with Juan del Valle under
>the following circumstances: On or about the four-
>teenth of January, 1875, when passing through 29th
>Street, near Broadway, I slipped on a piece of ice and
>fell on the sidewalk, badly spraining my ankle. Recov-
>ering from my bewilderment, I found myself being
>raised by a gentleman, who called a carriage and took
>me home. He assisted me into the house, and asked
>whether he might call again and see how I was getting
>on. I asked my mother, and she gave him permission.
>He called the next day, and passed half or three quarters
>of an hour with me, and told me he was a gentleman
>of character and position, a widower, and lived at 55
>West 28th Street, that he was very much pleased with
>and impressed by me, and that he desired to become
>better acquainted. He then asked whether he might call
>in the evening and take me to the theatre. I told him
>that my stepfather was very particular with me, and would
>not permit gentlemen to take me out in the evening, but
>that, as mother had given her consent, I had no objec-
>tions to his calling in the afternoon. He called three or
>four times a week, sometimes with his two younger chil
>dren, and sometimes taking me to drive in the Park.
>
>About three weeks after the beginning of our
>acquaintance he told me he had become very fond of
>me, and would like to marry me; that his wife had
>been dead for three years, and that he was alone in the
>world with four children who had no mother to care
>for them, and that if I could sacrifice my young life
>for an old man like him, he would marry me and give
>me a pleasant home; that he was a gentleman of wealth,
>able to provide for my every want, and that if I would
>accept him I should no longer be compelled, either
>to endure the strict discipline of my stepfather, or to
>struggle for simple existence by teaching. He gave
>me the names of several residents of New York,
>some of whom my stepfather knew personally, of whom
>I might make inquiries as to his character and position.
>
>I asked Mr. del Valle whether he was in earnest,
>saying that I was comparatively poor, and since my
>stepfather's embarrassment in business had not mingled
>in society, and wondered that he should select me when
>there were so many other ladies who would seem more
>eligible to a gentleman of his wealth and position. He
>replied that he was in earnest and that he had once
>married for wealth, but should not do so again. He told
>me to talk with mother and give him an answer as soon
>as possible. He said that he loved me from the first
>moment he saw me, and could not do without me.
>My mother gave consent and I promised to marry him.
>Mr. del Valle then took me to Delmonico's and after
>we had dined we went to a jewellery store in 6th Avenue,
>and he selected an amethyst ring for an engagement
>ring, as he said. The ring was too large and was left to
>be made smaller. Two or three days afterward he called
>on me at my house, placed the ring on my finger, and
>said, 'Keep that ring on that finger until I replace it
>with another.'
>
>At the third interview after the presentation of the
>ring, Mr. del Valle said that owing to some difficulties
>in his domestic affairs, which he called a 'compromise,'
>he did not think it best to be married publicly, as he
>feared that the publication of his marriage might cause
>trouble. So he urged me to marry him immediately
>and privately. I was greatly surprised, and said: 'If
>there is any trouble, why marry at all? I hope there
>is nothing wrong. What is the nature of the "com-
>promise"?' and he replied: ‘Oh, there is nothing wrong,
>but I have a "compromise" in Cuba, and it is not con-
>venient for you or me to marry publicly, as the person
>concerned might make you trouble.'
>
>I told Mr. del Valle that I would not marry him
>privately, and that I would release him from his engage-
>ment. A day or two afterward he took me to a restau-
>rant to dine with him, and I then gave him a letter
>in which I enclosed the engagement ring, and told him
>I would not marry him privately. This letter I sealed,
>asking him not to open it until after we had separated.
>Five or six days afterward he called again, and seemed
>ill. He said that my letter had made him sick, and
>he asked, 'What could induce you to write such a letter,
>Eugénie? You could not have loved me if you thought
>so much about the nonsense I told you about a com-
>promise. The compromise is all arranged, and I want
>you to take back the ring, and say when and where we
>shall be married.' I said I still loved him, and if the
>'compromise' had been arranged, I would accept the
>ring, but would not marry him secretly. He then put
>the ring on my finger, and said, 'Now I want you to tell
>when and where we shall get married.' It was finally
>agreed that we should be married in the fall.
>
>From the date of this conversation, which was early
>in March, 1875, until the twenty-eighth of April, 1875,
>Mr. del Valle called almost daily and took me to
>theatres and other places, and was received at home
>by all my family except my stepfather as my accepted
>suitor. He frequently complained that he could not
>call in the evening, and wished me to live in his house
>in Twenty-eighth Street, and take charge of his children.
>I refused, and he then proposed to take a place in the
>country, where the children could have plenty of air
>and exercise, if I would go and take charge of them,
>and as we were to be married so soon, he wished me
>to get well acquainted with his children, adding that
>if I really loved him, I need have no doubt about his
>honorable intentions.
>
>I laughed at the idea, but finally consented to leave
>my home and go into the country with his family. As
>I was losing all my pupils he insisted upon giving me
>$100 a month. He persuaded me there was no impro-
>priety in his suggestion, as we were to be married, and
>that I should never return home excepting as his wife.
>I had told him that my stepfather had threatened to
>shoot me and any man whom I might marry. He per-
>suaded me to leave my home at once, and as he had not
>yet secured a country house for the summer, I was to go
>to the Hotel Royal for a few days and live under an
>assumed name, which I did. He kept me at the hotel
>for five weeks, persuading me not to return home, and
>by the first of June he had secured a country place at
>Poughkeepsie, and I went there to live with himself and
>his four children.
>
>His conduct toward me up to this time had always
>been everything that could be desired, always kind
>and considerate and anxious for my every comfort,
>neither by word or act did he indicate to me that his
>intention was any other than to make me his wife. He
>had engaged a very fine mansion at Poughkeepsie, over-
>looking the Hudson, fine grounds, and everything one
>could desire in a country house. Mr. del Valle gave me
>the keys to the house and told me the entire establish-
>ment was under my charge.
>
>Six days after I arrived at Poughkeepsie he forced
>his way into my bedroom. I insisted upon an immediate
>marriage as my right. He told me he had not been
>for me. He tried to persuade me that I would best
>able to arrange the compromise in Cuba, and begged me
>to be reasonable and he would be my life friend; that I
>could not return home under the circumstances, and that
>anything I might at any time want he would always do
>accept the situation as it was, and that it was a very com-
>mon occurrence. I had no home to go to and did not
>dare to record the circumstance to my mother; I would
>have died first. Three months later, or at the end of the
>summer, his manner entirely changed toward me. I re-
>peatedly asked him for some explanation. He persuaded
>me that his coldness was assumed to prevent the ser-
>vants from talking, that he was going to Cuba to try to
>fix up the compromise, and prevailed upon me to go
>back to my home and parents and wait. This I did on
>the sixth of September. After I returned to New York I
>wrote to him but received no reply, and have never seen
>him since.

Nothing could be more witty or brilliant than Mr.
Choate's own description to the jury of "the appearance
of this fair and beautiful woman while she was giving
her evidence on the witness-stand." It was a part of
the exhibition, he said, which no reporter had been
adequate to describe.

>Gentlemen, have you seen since the opening of this
>trial one blush, one symptom of distress upon her sharp
>and intelligent features? Not one. There was in a
>critical point of her examination a breaking down or a
>breaking up, as I should prefer to call it. Her handker-
>chief was applied to her eyes; there was a loud cry for
>Water, water,' from my learned friend, echoed by his
>worthy and amiable junior, as though the very Bench
>itself were about to be wrapped in flames! \[_Laughter_.\]
>But when the crisis was over, then it appeared that there
>had only been a momentary eclipse of the handkerchief,
>that she had been shedding dry tears all the while!
>Not a muscle was disturbed; she advanced in the
>progress of her story with sparkling eyes and radiant
>smile and tripping tongue, and thus continued to the
>end of the case!
>
>The great masters of English fiction have loved
>nothing better than to depict the appearance in court
>of these wounded and bleeding victims of seduction
>when they come to be arrayed before the gaze of the
>world.
>
>You cannot have forgotten how Walter Scott and
>George Eliot have portrayed them sitting through the
>ordeal of their trials,--- the very pictures of crushed
>and bleeding innocence, withering under the blight
>that had fallen upon them from Heaven, or risen upon
>them from Hell. Never able so much as to raise their
>eyes to the radiant dignity of the Bench \[Laughter\],
>seeming to bear mere existence as a burden and a
>sorrow. But, gentlemen, our future novelist, if he will
>listen and learn from what has been exhibited here,
>will have a wholly different picture to paint. He will
>not omit the bright and fascinating smile, the sparkling
>eye, the undisturbed composure from the beginning to
>the end of the terrible ordeal. With what zest and
>relish and keen enjoyment she detailed her story! What
>must be the condition of mind and heart of the woman
>who can detail such stories to such an audience as was
>gathered together here!

Speaking of the whole case, Mr. Choate said:
"Never did a privateer upon the Spanish main give
chase to and board a homeward-bound Indiaman with
more avidity and vigor than this family proposed to
board this rich Cuban and make a capture of him. It
was a 'big bonanza' thrown to them in their distress."

It will be seen that the one great question of fact
to be disposed of in the case was whether there was a
breach of promise of marriage on the part of the de-
fendant to the plaintiff; that being decided in the
negative, everything else would disappear from the
case. All other matters were simply incidental to
that.

The conflicting evidence could not be reconciled.
One side was wholly true, the other side wholly false,
and the jury were to be called upon to say where the
truth was. Was there a promise of marriage three
weeks after the plaintiff and defendant met on the
corner of 29th Street and Broadway?

The plaintiff had stated in substance that after three
weeks the defendant proposed marriage and she accepted
him; that he took her in a carriage to Delmonico's
to lunch and took her to a jeweller's store in Sixth
Avenue and there purchased a ring as a binding token
of the promise of marriage. That was her case. If
the jury believed that, she would succeed. If they did
not, her case falls. That ring was a clincher, according
to her statement of the story, given on the heels of the
promise of marriage. What else could it mean but to
bind that bargain? This was the way the case stood
when Mr. Choate rose to cross-examine Miss Martinez.

There could be no greater evidence of the success of
the particular method of examination that Mr. Choate
chose to adopt on this occasion than the comment in
the _New York Sun_: "A vigorous cross-examination by
Mr. Joseph Choate did not shake the plaintiff's testi-
mony. Miss Martinez told her story over again, only
more in detail!" How poor a judge of the art of cross-
examination this newspaper scribe proved himself to be!
He had entirely failed to penetrate the subtlety of Mr.
Choate's methods or to realize that, in the light of the
testimony that was to follow for the defence, Miss
Martinez, during her ordeal, which she appeared to
stand so well, had been wheedled into a complete
annihilation of her case, unconsciously to herself and
apparently to all who heard her.

In sharp contrast to Mr. Choate's style of cross-exami-
nation is that adopted by Sir Charles Russell in the
cross-examination of the witness Pigott,--- which is given
in the following chapter, ---and where the general ver-
dict of the audience as Pigott left the witness-box was
"_smashed_"; and yet, though the audience did not realize
it, Miss Martinez left the witness-stand so effectually
"smashed that there never afterwards could be any
doubt in Mr. Choate's mind as to the final outcome of
the case. In his summing up Mr. Choate made this
modest reference to his cross-examination: "I briefly
ask your attention to her picture as painted by herself,
---to her evidence, and her letters, giving us her history
and her career." And then he proceeded to tear her
whole case to pieces, bit by bit, in consequence of the
admissions she had unsuspectingly made during her
cross-examination.

>And now, gentlemen, with pain and sorrow I say it,
has not this lady by her own showing, by her own written
and spoken evidence and the corroborating testimony of
her sister, _established_ her character in such a way that it
will live as long as the memory of this trial survives?

In starting his cross-examination Mr. Choate pro-
ceeded to introduce the plaintiff to the jury by interro-
gating her with a series of short, simple questions, the
answers to which elicited from the lady a detailed
account of her life in New York since the year of her
birth.

She said she was twenty-one years old; was born in
New York City; her parents were French; her own
father was a wine merchant; he died when she was
seven years old; two years later her mother married a
Mr. Henriques, with whom she had lived as her step-
father for the fourteen years preceding the trial. She
had been educated in a boarding-school, and since gradu-
ation had been employing herself as a teacher of lan-
guages, etc., etc.

Mr. Choate had in his possession a letter written by
the plaintiff to Mr. del Valle during the first few weeks
of their acquaintance. In this letter Miss Martinez had
complained of the wretchedness of her home life in con-
sequence of the amorous advances made to her by her
stepfather. Mr. Choate was evidently of the opinion
that this letter was a hoax and had been written by Miss
Martinez for the sole purpose of eliciting Mr. del Valle's
sympathy, and inducing him to allow her to come and
live in his family as the governess of his children with
the idea that a proposal of marriage would naturally
result from such propinquity. Suspecting that the con-
tents of this letter227/1 were false, and judging from state-
ments made in the plaintiff's testimony-in-chief that she
had either forgotten all about this letter or concluded
that it had been destroyed, Mr. Choate set the first trap
for the plaintiff in the following simple and extremely
clever manner.

227/1 DEAR FRIEND:

    \

    I believe I promised to write and tell you my secret. I will
    now do so. When I was nine years of age my father died. My mother
    married my uncle, who is now my father. To make a long story short, papa
    loves me, and has done everything in his power to rob me of what is dearer to
    me than my life,--- my honor. And ever since I was a little child he has
    annoyed me with infamous propositions and does so still. You can easily
    imagine how unhappy and miserable he made me, for I don't love him the
    way he wishes me to, and I cannot give him what he wants, for I would
    sooner part with my life. I have only God to thank for my unsullied honor.
    He has watched over me in all my troubles, for oh, my dear friend, I have
    had so many, many trials! But it is God's will and I always tried to be a good
    girl, and now you know my secret, my heart feels light. I now leave you,
    wishing you all my sincere good wishes, and with many kisses to the dear
    little girls, I remain your friend,

    \

    "Eugénie.

    \

    "N.B. I will meet you on Saturday at 1 o'clock, corner of Twenty-eighth
    Street and Broadway."

Mr. Choate. "By what name did you pass after you
returned home from boarding-school and found your
mother married to Mr. Henriques?"

Miss Martinez. "Eugénie Henriques, invariably."
Mr. Choate. And when did you first resume the
name of Martinez?”

Miss Martinez. "When I left the roof of Mr.
Henriques."

Mr. Choate. · "Always until that time were you called
by his name?"

Miss Martinez. "Always."

Mr. Choate. "Did your father exercise any very
rigid discipline over yourself and your sister that you
remember?"

Miss Martinez. "He did."

Mr. Choate. "When did that rigid discipline begin?"

Miss Martinez. "It commenced when I first knew
him.”

Mr. Choate. "And it was very rigid, wasn't it?'

Miss Martinez. "It was, very."

Mr. Choate. "Both over yourself and over your
younger sister?"

Miss Martinez. "Yes."

Mr. Choate. "Taking very strict observation and care
as to your morals and your manners?"

Miss Martinez. "Exceedingly so."

Mr. Choate. "How did this manifest itself?'

Miss Martinez. "Well, in preventing my having any
other associates. He thought there was no one good
enough to associate with us."

Mr. Choate. "Then he was always very strict in
keeping you in the path of duty, was he not?"
Miss Martinez. "Most undeniably so."

Mr. Choate. "Was this a united family of which you
were a member? Were they united in feeling?"

Miss Martinez. "Very much so indeed. There are
very few families that are more united than we were."

Mr. Choate. "All fond of each other?"

Miss Martinez. "Always."

One can readily picture to himself Mr. Choate and
the fair plaintiff smiling upon each other as these
friendly questions were put and answered. And the
plaintiff, entirely off her guard, is then asked, probably
in a cooing tone of gentleness and courtesy that can be
easily imagined by any one who has ever heard Mr.
Choate in court, the _important_ question :---

Mr. Choate. "As to your _stepfather_, you were all
fond of him and he of you?"

Miss Martinez. "Very fond of him indeed, and he
very fond of us."

Mr. Choate. "And except this matter of his rigid
discipline, was he kind to you?"

Miss Martinez. “Very."

Mr. Choate. "And gentle?"

Miss Martinez. "Very gentle and very kind."

Mr. Choate. "Considerate?"

Miss Martinez. "Very considerate always of our hap-
piness, but he did not wish us to associate with the
people by whom we were surrounded, as we were not
in circumstances to live amongst our class."

Mr. Choate. "When was it that he first introduced
the subject of marriage, or forbidding you to marry, or
thinking of marrying?"

Miss Martinez. "Well, when I was about sixteen or
seventeen."

Mr. Choate. "And was it then that he said that if you
married, he would shoot you and shoot any man that
you married?"

Miss Martinez. "He did.”

Mr. Choate. "That was the one exception to his
ordinary gentleness and kindness, wasn't it?"

Miss Martinez. “Yes.”

Mr. Choate. "And the only one?'

Miss Martinez. "And the only one."

Mr. Choate. "Your stepfather is no longer living,
is he?"

Miss Martinez. "He is not. He died last October."

It will be observed that Mr. Choate did not confront
the witness at this point with the letter that she had
written, complaining of her father's brutal advances to
her, and of the necessity of her leaving her home in con-
sequence. Many cross-examiners would have produced
the letter and would have confronted the witness on the
spot with the contradiction it contained, instead of
saving it for the summing up. It is interesting to study
the effect of such a procedure. By a production of this
letter, the witness would have been immediately dis-
credited in the eyes of the jury; the full force of the
contradictory letter would have been borne in upon the
jury as perhaps it could not have been at any other time
in the proceeding, and the _Sun_ reporter could not have
said the plaintiff had not been "shaken." On the other
hand, it would have put the witness upon her guard at
the very start of her cross-examination, and she would
have avoided many of the pitfalls which she confidingly
stepped into later in her testimony. All through the
examination Mr. Choate had frequent opportunities to
put the witness on her guard, but at the same time
_off her balance_. It is a mooted question which method
is the better one to employ. It all depends upon the
nature of the case on trial.

Richard Harris, K.C., an English barrister who has
written several clever books on advocacy, says: "From
a careful observation, I have reluctantly come to the
conclusion that in five cases out of six, I would back
the advocate and not the case." This is especially true
of a breach of promise case when the suit is for a breach
of promise of marriage, but when owing to the unwise
conduct of the defendant's lawyer at the trial in un-
necessarily attacking the woman plaintiff, the verdict of
the jury in her favor is for _slander_. It may have been
some such consideration as this which determined Mr.
Choate to save all his "points" for his summing up.

It is perhaps the _safer_ course of the two in cases of
this kind, but I doubt very much if, in the great majority
of cases, it is the wiser one; for it must be remembered
that there are few lawyers at the Bar who can make
such use of his "points" in his summing up as did
Mr. Choate.

Had Miss Martinez been confronted with her own
letter in which she had written of her stepfather, "He
loves me and has done everything in his power to rob
me of what is dearer to me than my life,--- my honor....
Ever since I was a little child he has annoyed me with
infamous propositions," etc., it would be difficult to
imagine any way in which she could reconcile her letter
and her sworn testimony, and Mr. Choate would have had
the upper hand of his witness from that time on.

Furthermore, during the examination of a witness the
jury invariably form their opinion of the witness' integrity,
and if that opinion is in favor of the witness it is often too
late to try to shake it in the summing up. It is usually,
therefore, the safer course to expose the witness to the
jury in his or her true colors during the examination, and,
if possible, prejudice them against her at the outset. In
such cases, oftentimes, no summing up at all would be
necessary, and the closing speech becomes a mere matter
of form. Many lawyers save their points in order to
make a brilliant summing up, but then it is perhaps too
late to change the jury's estimate of the witnesses. An
opinion once formed by a juror is not easily changed by
a speech, however eloquent. This is the experience of
every trial lawyer.

As evidence of how completely this part of Mr. Choate's
case flattened out because it was left until the final argu-
ment, it is only necessary to call the reader's attention to
all that was said on the subject in the summing up, viz.:
Her letter was read to the jury, which she had delivered
to the defendant on the fifteenth of March, revealing her
stepfather's barbarous treatment of her. When I was
cross-examining her, I did it with that letter in my hand,
with a view to what was written in it; so I asked her
about the relations existing between herself and her step-
father, and she said he was always kind and loving and
considerate, tender and gentle."

Instead of nailing this point in the cross-examination,
as Sir Charles Russell, for instance, would have done,
Mr. Choate turns quietly to the next subject of his ex-
amination, which is one of vital importance to his client
and to the theory of his defence.

Mr. Choate. "Can you fix the date in January when
you first saw the defendant, Mr. del Valle?

Miss Martinez. "It was on the fifteenth day of Janu-
ary,---either the fourteenth or the fifteenth. It was on
a Thursday. I had an appointment with my dentist."

Mr. Choate. "Thursday appears by the calendar of
that year to have been on the _fourteenth_ of January."

Miss Martinez. "That was the day."

The supreme importance of this inquiry lies in the
fact that Mr. Choate was in possession of the account
books of the jeweller from whom the alleged "engage-
ment ring" had been purchased. These records
showed that the ring had been bought on the _fifteenth_
day of January, or _one day after_ the plaintiff and the
defendant _first met_, and before there had been any
opportunity for acquaintance or love making, or any
suggestion or possibility of a proposition of marriage
and presentation of an engagement ring, which, as the
plaintiff said in her own story, had been given her
with the express request that she should wear it until
another ring should take its place.

Mr. del Valle's version of the story, which Mr. Choate
was intending to develop later in the case, was that he
had met the plaintiff, was pleased with her, had assisted
her to her home, had met her again the following day,
had suggested to her, as a little memento of their
acquaintance and his coming to her assistance, that
she would allow him to present her with a ring, and
that after lunching together in a private room at
Solari's, they had gone to a jeweller's and he had
selected for her an amethyst ring in commemoration
of the day of their meeting. It was this ring which
the plaintiff later tried to convert into an engagement
ring, which she claimed was given her _three_ or _four
weeks_ after she had first made the acquaintance of Mr.
del Valle, and after he had repeatedly asked her hand
in marriage.

Mr. Choate. "What time in the day was it that you
first met Mr. del Valle on this Thursday, the fourteenth
day of January?"

Miss Martinez. "About half-past two o'clock in the
afternoon."

Mr. Choate. "Have you any means of fixing the
hour of that day?"

Miss Martinez. "Yes. I had an appointment with
my dentist at three o'clock."

Mr. Choate. "Your appointment with the dentist had
been previously made, and you were on your way there?"
Miss Martinez. "I was on my way there."

Mr. Choate. "It was at the corner of Broadway and
29th Street that you fell on the ice, was it not?
Miss Martinez. "It was.”

Mr. Choate. "You did not observe the defendant
before you fell?"

Miss Martinez. "I did not."

Mr. Choate. "And you had never seen him before?

Miss Martinez. "I had never seen him before."

Mr. Choate. "Did this fall render
you insensible ?"

Miss Martinez. "Very nearly so. I fell on my side
and was lying down on the ground when Mr. del Valle
raised me up.
I remember there were some iron rail-
ings near there, and I was leaning against these railings
while Mr. del Valle hailed a cab, assisted me into
it, and took me home. He told me in the cab that
he had been following me all the way up Broadway."

Mr. Choate. "Did he tell you for what object he fol-
lowed you?"

Miss Martinez. "He did not. He merely told me
that he was following me."

Mr. Choate. "And you did not ask him for what
purpose he followed you?"

Miss Martinez. "I did not.”

Mr. Choate. "Did he drive
you to your home?"

Miss Martinez. "He did, and when we arrived he
assisted me into the house. I had sprained my ankle.
He explained my accident to my mother, and that he
had brought me home. My mother thanked him and
he asked if he might call again and see how I was get-
ting along with my injury.”

The plaintiff had explained that it was the serious
nature of her injury which had occasioned her allow-
ing a stranger to get her a cab and take her home.
Whereas the clerks in the jeweller's store where the ring
was bought _the day following the accident_, remembered
distinctly seeing the plaintiff and the defendant together
in the jewellery store for over half an hour while they
were selecting the ring.

In order to involve the plaintiff in further difficulties
and contradictions, Mr. Choate continues in the same
vein:---

Mr. Choate. "You were somewhat seriously disabled
by your accident, were you not?"

Miss Martinez. "I was."

Mr. Choate. "For how long?"

Miss Martinez. "Well, for two or three days."

Mr. Choate. "A sprained ankle?"

Miss Martinez. "My ankle hurt me very much. I
had it bandaged with cold water and lay on the bed for
two days. The third day I was able to limp around
the room only a little, and the fourth day I could walk
around."

Mr. Choate. "How long was it before you got entirely
over it so as to be able to go out of doors?"

Miss Martinez. "Well, _I went out the fifth day_."

Mr. Choate. "And not before?"

Miss Martinez. "And not before."

Mr. Choate. "So that because of the injuries that you
sustained, you were confined to the house for five
days?"

Miss Martinez. "I was."

Mr. Choate. "And the first day, or January 16 (this
was the day she had bought the ring), you were confined
to your room and lying upon the bed?"

Miss Martinez. "Yes, sir. I reclined upon my bed.
I was not confined in bed as sick."

Mr. Choate. "When was the first time that you were
with Mr. del Valle at any time except at your father's
or your mother's house?"

Miss Martinez. "Do you mean the first time that I
went out with him?"

Mr. Choate. "Yes."

Miss Martinez. "It was during the week following
that in which I met him. I met him on Thursday,
the fourteenth, and went out with him sometime during
the following week."

Mr. Choate. “What was the place?"

Miss Martinez. "We went to Delmonico's to dine."

***

Mr. Choate. "Was the ring the only present he gave
you, or the first present?"

Miss Martinez. "Oh, no, not by any means."

Mr. Choate. "When did you begin to accept presents
from him?"

Miss Martinez. "The first day I went out with him,
when we went to Delmonico's, I accepted books from
him."

Mr. Choate. "What was the book that he then pre-
sented to you?"

Miss Martinez. "Oh, well, I forget the title of it. I
think it was 'Les Misérables' by Victor Hugo."

Mr. Choate. "And from that time he continued, when
you went out with him, as a general thing, giving you
something?"

Miss Martinez. "Giving me books and buying me
candies. After we were through dining, he would stop
at a confectioner's and buy me something."

Mr. Choate. "Down to the first time of the first talk
of marriage, which you say was about three weeks after
you met, how many times did you go with him to Del-
monico's, or other restaurants?"

Miss Martinez. "Well, on an average of about two
or three times a week."

Mr. Choate. "Where else did you go besides Del-
monico's?"

Miss Martinez. "The first time I went to any place
with him besides Delmonico's was at the time of the
engagement, when he gave me the ring,--- when he
bought the ring for me."

Mr. Choate. "Where did you go then?"

Miss Martinez. "We went in University Place some-
where. I do not exactly know what street."

Mr. Choate. "What side of University Place was it?"
Miss Martinez. "On the opposite side from Chris-
tern's book store."

Mr. Choate (with a smile). "Was it a place called
Solari's?"

Miss Martinez (hesitating). “I think it was."

Mr. Choate. "How many times did you go there
with him before he gave you the ring?"

Miss Martinez. "I never went there before he gave
me the ring. That was the first time I ever went to
this place."

Mr. Choate. "How came you way down there in
University Place if you live up in 56th Street? Did
you make an appointment to be there?"

Miss Martinez. "He came up to the house for me."

Mr. Choate. "Came up and took you down there?”

Miss Martinez. "Yes. Didn't he come up to in-
quire if I had accepted him as a husband, and ask me
if I had consulted with my mother, and ask me what
answer I had for him, and had I not told him that I
would marry him? It was then that he took me to
this restaurant in a carriage, and after that he bought
the ring for me."

Mr. Choate. “The same day?"

Miss Martinez. "The very same day."

Mr. Choate. "Some considerable number of weeks,
you say, intervened between your first acquaintance
and this dinner at Solari's, --- this engagement and the
giving of the ring?"

Miss Martinez. "About three weeks as nearly as
I can fix the time."

Mr. Choate. "Where was this jewellery store where
the ring was bought?"

Miss Martinez. "It was on Sixth Avenue. I cannot
say near what street it was. I felt cold and tired that
day. We walked from Solari's and it seemed to me
as though the walk was rather long."

Mr. Choate. "You remember the name of the store?"
Miss Martinez. "I do not."

Mr. Choate. "Should you know the name if I told
you?"

Miss Martinez. "No, I never knew the name."

This jeweller took the witness-stand for the defence,
and testified that Miss Martinez was present on the fif-
teenth of January, when the ring was bought, according
to the entry made in his books, and that in consequence
of the ring being too large she had ordered it made
smaller, and had returned three days later herself alone,
had taken the ring from his hand, and had given
him a letter addressed to Mr. del Valle, asking him to
deliver it when Mr. del Valle should call to pay for the
ring, " although," as Mr. Choate sarcastically put it, “it
had been in her fond memory as a cherished remem-
brance that Mr. del Valle had put it on her finger
and told her to keep it there until he replaced it with
another. Who does not see," said Mr. Choate, in his
summing up, "that the disappearance of the ring from
the case as a gift upon a promise of marriage three weeks
after the first acquaintance carries down with it all
this story of the return of the ring to the defendant,
and the defendant's re-return of it to the plaintiff?
211
------
Mr. Choate. "Did you ever go to this store but the
one time?"
Miss Martinez. "Never went there but the one time."
Mr. Choate. And you are sure of that?"
Miss Martinez. "I am very sure of that."
Mr. Choate. "The only time you were there was
with Mr. del Valle?'
Miss Martinez. "That was the only time I have ever
been in that store in my life."
Mr. Choate. "You say you looked at a solitaire
diamond ring?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes, but Mr. del Valle told me
that he preferred an amethyst, and I took the amethyst.”
Mr. Choate. There was a considerable difference
66
in the cost, wasn't there, between them?
Miss Martinez. "There was."
Mr. Choate. "Do you know the cost of the amethyst
ring?”
Miss Martinez. "I think it was forty-five dollars."
Mr. Choate. The cost of a solitaire diamond ring
might be many hundreds of dollars?"
Miss Martinez. "One hundred and five dollars, one
hundred and ten dollars, one hundred and fifteen dol-
lars, I do not know."
Mr. Choate. "Did you look at any other jewellery?
Miss Martinez. "Mr. del Valle asked me if I wished
anything else, but I did not."
Mr. Choate here deviated from his former plan of not
242
------
confronting the witness with the evidence he was in-
tending to contradict her with, and having first shown
the witness the letter addressed to Mr. del Valle which
she had left at the jeweller's on her second visit there,
the handwriting of which the witness denied, Mr.
Choate followed with this question: ¹
Mr. Choate. "Now let me refresh your recollection a
little, Miss Martinez. Didn't this visit to the jeweller's
take place on the fifteenth of January, the day after you
made the acquaintance of Mr. del Valle?"
Miss Martinez. "Oh, no, not by any means, sir."
Mr. Choate. "Sure of that?"
Miss Martinez. "I am very sure of it, for I was con-
fined to my room the day after I first made the acquaint-
ance of Mr. del Valle."
Then you never went to that jeweller's
Mr. Choate.
store but once?"
Miss Martinez. "Never. I would not know the store,
and do not know. I do not recollect the name or any-
thing about it."
Mr. Choate. "There was some trouble about the ring
being too large, wasn't there?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes, the ring was too large for the
finger I wished it for."
1 This is an illustration of a practice recommended in a former chapter, of
asking questions upon the cross-examination which you know the witness will
deny, but which will acquaint the jury with the nature of the defence and
serve to keep up their interest in the examination.
------
Mr. Choate. "And orders were left to have it made
smaller?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "What arrangement was made, if any,
for your getting the ring when it should be made
smaller?"
Miss Martinez. There was no arrangement made.
Mr. del Valle merely said that when he called upon me
again he would bring it to me, and he did bring it to
me."
Mr. Choate. "About what time was that; in Feb-
ruary?"
Miss Martinez. "It was, I should say, the first week
in February. I cannot give the exact date."
Mr. Choate. "Now let me again try to refresh your
recollection. Didn't you yourself go to the jewellery
store and get the ring?"
Miss Martinez. "I myself?"
Mr. Choate. "You yourself."
Miss Martinez. "I never went to that jewellery store
but once in my life and that was with Mr. del Valle
himself while I selected the ring."

On behalf of the defendant Mr. Choate was intending
to swear as witnesses a Mr. Louis, who kept the store
on Ninth Avenue around the corner from where the
plaintiff lived in 44th Street, and a Mrs. Krank, who
lived around the corner from her residence on 56th
------
-
Street, who would both testify that the plaintiff had a
confirmed habit of having letters left there, - letters
from various gentlemen, some of them having the mono-
gram “F. H.,” the initials of Frederick Hammond, the
clerk of the Hotel Royal. Mr. Choate also had in his
possession a letter of the twenty-second of January, in
the plaintiff's handwriting and addressed to Mr. del
Valle at the inception of their acquaintance, which read,
"Should you deem it necessary to write to me, a line ad-
dressed Miss Howard, in care of J. Krank, 1060 First
Avenue,' will reach me." In anticipation of this testi-
mony, Mr. Choate next interrogated the witness as
follows:
Mr. Choate. "Did you ever go by any other name
than your own father's name, Martinez, or your step-
father's name, Henriques?
Miss Martinez. "I did not."
Mr. Choate. "Did you ever have letters left for you
directed to Miss Howard, care of J. Krank, No. 1060
First Avenue '? "1
(
Miss Martinez. "I never did."
Mr. Choate. "Do you know No. 1060 First Avenue?"
Miss Martinez. "I do not. I have no idea where
it is."
Mr. Choate. "Do you know what numbers on First
Avenue are near to your house on 56th Street?"
¹ Mr. Choate took as one theme for his summing up: "The woman who
possesses an alias in the big cities of the world."
215
------
Miss Martinez. "I do not. I never went on First
Avenue.
Mr. Choate. "Did you ever have any letters sent to
you addressed to 'Miss Howard, care of Mrs. C. Nelson,'
on Ninth Avenue?'
>>
Miss Martinez. "I never did."
Here Mr. Choate again treads upon the toes of the
witness' veracity, but it is difficult to see why he did not
confront her then and there with her own letter. By
adopting such a course he took no chances whatever.
He would have dealt her a serious blow in the eyes of
the jury.
Instead, Mr. Choate contents himself by put-
ting this letter in evidence, while the defendant himself
was on the witness-stand, and the jury never really saw
the point of it until the summing up, when their heads
were so full of other things that this serious prevarica-
tion of the plaintiff probably went almost unnoticed.¹
*
*
*
Mr. Choate. "At the meeting when Mr. del Valle
brought the ring to your house, was anybody present?"
Miss Martinez. "Nobody was present."
Mr. Choate. "And I have forgotten how long you
said it was that you kept the ring before returning it to
him?"
Miss Martinez. "I never told you any stated time."
Mr. Choate. "Well, I would like to know now."
¹ The jury remained locked up for twenty-six hours unable to agree upon a
verdict, several of them voting for large damages.
246
------
Miss Martinez. "I returned the ring to him when I
dissolved the engagement between him and me - about
a week or so after I had received the ring."
Mr. Choate. Then it was only a week that the en-
gagement lasted at first before it was resumed the
second time?"
Miss Martinez. "Well, I think so."
The plaintiff had already read in evidence to the
jury a fabricated copy of a letter breaking her engage-
ment to the defendant, and returning him the ring.
There had been no such letter in fact handed to Mr.
del Valle, but the plaintiff had substituted this alleged
copy for a letter, the original of which Mr. Choate had
in his possession, which was the one already referred
to, wherein the plaintiff had complained of the brutal
solicitations of her stepfather, and had requested him
not to read until he was alone.
Mr. Choate. "Now you have spoken of the circum-
stances under which you returned him the ring in a
letter, with injunctions not to open the letter until you
separated. What was your purpose in requiring him
not to open the letter until he should be out of your
presence?"
Miss Martinez. Because I knew if I told him what
my purpose was, he would not accept of it. He would
not dissolve the engagement between us, and I wished
him to see that I was determined upon it. That was
my purpose."
217
------
Mr. Choate. "Was not the fact of the ring being in
the letter quite obvious from the outside?"
Miss Martinez. "It was, and he asked me what it
was.
Mr. Choate. Where was it that you handed him
that letter?”
Miss Martinez. "When we were dining."
Mr. Choate. "At what place? Was it this place you
have just mentioned, Solari's?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes, sir."
Mr. Choate. "How many times had you been there
then?"
Miss Martinez. "We went there after our engage-
ment very frequently."
Mr. Choate. "Was that your regular place of meeting
after your engagement?"
Miss Martinez. "Sometimes we went to Delmonico's;
more frequently we went to Solari's."
Mr. Choate. "And it was there that you handed him
the letter? How long before going there had. you
written the letter?"
Miss Martinez. "It was written the day after he
spoke to me of having a compromise in Cuba. The
very day after, I made up my mind to break the
engagement."
Mr. Choate. "Tell me, if you please, all that he said
when he spoke about this compromise."
Miss Martinez. "Well, we were coming home in a
248
------
carriage, and he asked me when we should be married,
and I told him I did not know; that I was not thinking
of it yet for some time, and he said that when we should
be married, he would like to be married privately, with-
out anybody knowing anything about it. That he had
a good many friends here in New York and people that
were apt to talk, and he requested me to marry him
privately and at once."
Mr. Choate. Did he say that he already had a wife
as a 'compromise'?"
Miss Martinez. "He did not."
Mr. Choate. "Did he explain in any way what this
compromise,' as you call it, was?"
-
some
Miss Martinez. He merely told me, ‘Oh, there is
no secrecy. I have a compromise in Cuba -
trouble there, for reasons best known to myself,' but
that it was better to marry privately."
Mr. Choate. "Did you believe he had another wife
living in Cuba?"
Miss Martinez. "No."
Mr. Choate. "What was there that you supposed
could prevent a man marrying again if he loved a
woman, as he said he did you, except the existence of a
wife already?
(
Miss Martinez. "Well, I thought perhaps he had
some alliance with some woman whom he had promised
to marry, or was obliged to marry, and could not marry
any other woman under those circumstances."
210
------
Mr. Choate. "He did not suggest anything of that
sort?"
Miss Martinez. "That was only the impression that I
received at the time, - what I thought."
-
Mr. Choate. "And you never had any other impres-
sion but that, had you?'
Miss Martinez. "No, I had not."
Mr. Choate. "When you concluded to take him again,
it was under that impression?
Miss Martinez. "Not at all. He told me that the
compromise was arranged and had been adjusted. I
took him again and became engaged to him.”
Mr. Choate. "Your idea of the nature of the com-
promise when you took him again was that he had been
engaged to another woman in Cuba and promised to
Is that it?"
marry her.
Miss Martinez. "Yes, sir, it was something of that
kind."
""
Mr. Choate. "Then when you concluded to take back
the ring, it was upon the understanding that he had
broken an engagement with a woman in Cuba. Did
it not occur to you as an obstacle, when you took him
again, that he had just broken a match with another
woman?"
Miss Martinez. "No, not at all."
Mr. Choate. "You did not care for that?'
Miss Martinez. "No. I did not care for it, because
I trusted him."
250
------
How often did Mr. del Valle visit you
Mr. Choate.
at this time?
Miss Martinez. "Four or five times a week."
Mr. Choate. "Did you and your mother keep these
visits of this gentleman and the engagement a secret
from your stepfather?”
Miss Martinez. "We did."
Mr. Choate. "And that because of his threat to shoot
you and the man if you ever married?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes, sir."
Mr. Choate. Had your father kept weapons ready?"
Miss Martinez. "Well, no, I do not think he did."
Mr. Choate seems to have changed his mind suddenly
upon the advisability of introducing the atrocious step-
father's letter. This was the wrong time to introduce it,
if at all, and his feeble attempt was productive of noth-
ing but a hasty retreat upon his own part.
Mr. Choate. Did you ever make any complaint to
Mr. del Valle of being harshly treated by your step-
father?
Miss Martinez. “I never did. My father never treated
me harshly."
Mr. Choate. "I want you to look at this signature
and see whether that is yours on the paper now handed
you" (passing a paper to witness).
Miss Martinez. "I could not say whether it is mine
or not."
Mr. Choate. "What is your opinion?"
251
------
Miss Martinez. "I do not think it is.
look like my signature."
*
*
It does not
Mr. Choate. "How is it that you have produced here
a copy of the letter in which you say you enclosed the
ring in February or March. How is that?"
Miss Martinez. “I do not know. I merely found a
copy one day in a book. I never made a practice of
copying."
Mr. Choate. When and where did you make the
copy of that letter?"
66
Miss Martinez. "I did not make any copy of it after
I had sent the letter to Mr. del Valle, but the paper
upon which I wrote was defective when I wrote it to
him. There was a blot or something on it, and I found
the copy afterwards!"
Mr. Choate. Then you do know exactly how you
came to have a copy?'
Miss Martinez.
66
Yes, it was in my desk drawer, that
is all, but I did not make a practice of keeping copies of
all the papers."
Mr. Choate. Did you not say a moment ago that
you did not know how you came to have a copy?
Miss Martinez. " No; I did not say I did not know
how I came to have a copy."
Mr. Choate. "In what respect did this copy differ
from the original enclosing the ring?"
Miss Martinez. "It did not differ. I only said there

was a blot upon the paper and I put it into a drawer and
wrote another one, and that paper remained blotted in
the drawer for a considerable length of time.”
Mr. Choate. What part of the paper was the blot
on?"
Miss Martinez. “The first page."
Mr. Choate (handing the letter to the witness).
"Whereabouts do you see the blot?"
66
Miss Martinez. "Oh, well, it is not on the copy at all."
Mr. Choate. "Oh, you sent the blotted one?"
Miss Martinez. "No, I did not. I kept the blotted
one in the drawer. I did not send that."
Mr. Choate. "Where is the blotted one?
Miss Martinez. "I have it at
home.
“I have it at home. I have a copy
home.'
of all these letters at
Mr. Choate. Then you made a second copy from
that blotted copy?
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate put one question too many by asking,
"Where is the blotted one?" The effect of his pre-
vious questions concerning this fabricated copy of a
letter was entirely lost by allowing her a chance to
reply, "I have the blotted copy at home. I have a
copy of all these letters at home." The reply was false,
but had she been called upon to produce the blotted
copy she could have easily supplied it over night. Mr.
Choate had made his point, a good one, but he didn't
leave it alone and so spoiled it.

All through his examination Mr. Choate skipped from
one subject to another, and then, without any apparent
reason, returned to the same subject again. This may
have been intentional art on his part or it may have been,
as is so often the case in the excitement of a long trial,
that new ideas occurred to him which brought him back
to old subjects that had apparently already been ex-
hausted. It would have been far more intelligible to
the jury to have exhausted one subject at a time. It is
asking too much of an ordinary juryman to shift his
attention back and forth from one subject to another
and expect him to catch all the points and carry clearly
in his memory all that has been previously said on the
subject. This mistake is almost unavoidable unless
the cross-examination is thought out thoroughly in
advance, which, of course, is sometimes impracticable,
as perhaps in the present case.
It was part of the plaintiff's evidence that Mr. del
Valle had induced her to leave her home and go to
the Hotel Royal under an assumed name until he
could engage a house in the country where she could
live as the governess to his children, pending their mar-
riage, and on a salary of $100 a month.¹ She said
1 Mr. Choate cross-examined the plaintiff at length on this part of the
case and in his summing up exclaimed, “Well, outlandish foreigners have
done all sorts of things, and men have various ways of looking at the same
thing, but here is a point and here is a question at which I think there are no
two ways of looking, and that is that it is contrary to the common instincts
of mankind, and a libel upon the common instincts of woman, that when
254
------
Mr. del Valle's object was to avoid the threat of her
stepfather to shoot any man to whom she might become
engaged. Mr. del Valle's own version of the story
was that Miss Martinez went to the Hotel Royal of
her own accord; notified him that she was there, that
she had deserted her home in consequence of her step-
father's advances to her, and that she was afraid to
return. She then begged him to allow her to teach
his children and to live with him in the country. Evi-
dently it was with these facts in mind that Mr. Choate
cross-questioned the plaintiff as follows:-
Mr. Choate. Now you say, Miss Martinez, that you
went to the hotel on the twenty-eighth day of April?"
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate. "From where did you go?"
Miss Martinez. From my own home.”
Mr. Choate. "Did you know anybody at that hotel?”
Miss Martinez. “I did not.”
66
Mr. Choate was prepared to show that the plaintiff
was acquainted with the clerk of the Hotel Royal, a man
by the name of Frederick Hammond, who on several
occasions was seen by the bell-boys in her room at the
Hotel Royal, at which times the door of her bedroom
a betrothal has taken place between a fair and unsophisticated virgin and a
man of any description, that in the interval between the betrothal and the
wedding ceremony, he should take her to his house and she should consent to
go upon a salary of $100 a month, to serve in the capacity of a housekeeper,
I leave the argument upon the point with you."
------
was locked. The defendant's evidence subsequently
showed, also, that many of the letters sent to the plain-
tiff under the name of Miss Howard, and addressed to
different letter boxes on First Avenue, etc., had on the
envelope the monogram "F. H." (Frederick Hammond).
Mr. Choate. "Did you know any of the managers or
clerks at the Hotel Royal?
Miss Martinez. "I did not."
Mr. Choate. "Did you register your name at that
hotel?"
Miss Martinez. "I just merely gave my name as
'Miss Livingston.' I did not register. I suppose I was
registered." (The name "Miss Livingston " registered on
the hotel register was in the handwriting of this same
Frederick Hammond.)
Mr. Choate. "To whom did you give your name as
Miss Livingston'?"
Miss Martinez. "To a gentleman whom I saw be-
fore taking board there. I went to arrange for a room
the day before, and he asked me my name and showed
me a room and I told him my name was 'Miss Living-
ston,' and he put it down."
Mr. Choate.
Who was that gentleman?"
Miss Martinez. "I do not know who he was, or
what he was."
Mr. Choate. "Do you know a gentleman named
Frederick Hammond?”
Miss Martinez. "My receipts were signed that way,
256
(
------
by the name of Hammond. Mr. del Valle told me
that he was acquainted with some of the managers of
the hotel, and it was that hotel that he suggested my
going to."
Mr. Choate. "You went by his suggestion?
Miss Martinez. Went by his suggestion to this
hotel."
Mr. Choate. Did he tell you of Frederick Ham-
mond?"
Miss Martinez. He did not. He merely said that
he knew some of the managers."
Mr. Choate. "You say that Hammond was the name
signed to your receipt?
}}
Miss Martinez. "Yes, sir."
Mr. Choate. Was that the name of the gentleman
to whom you gave your name as 'Miss Livingston'?"
Miss Martinez. "I really do not know."
Mr. Choate. "Was it anybody you had ever seen
before?"
Miss Martinez. "I had never seen the person before
in my life." ¹
1
Mr. Choate. "And you do not know how or by
whom your name was registered in that hotel book?"
¹ Mr. Choate, in his argument to the jury, said: "They went to her room
on two separate occasions and found her there with Mr. Hammond with the
door locked, Mr. Hammond sitting on the bed. This might have been ex-
plained had she not already said in her cross-examination that she did not
know Mr. Hammond. Now how do they meet it?"
------
Miss Martinez. "I do not know. The gentleman
merely asked me my name and I told him. I told him
the room would suit me, and I would come the next
day."
Mr. Choate. "Then you went alone both days?"
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate. "And both times without the de-
fendant?"
Miss Martinez. "Without the defendant."
Mr. Choate. "You selected a room that suited you?"
Miss Martinez. "I did. On the top floor.
It was
the only room that was available."
It was shown later that this room was a small-sized
hall bedroom, and yet Miss Martinez was supposed to
have made this arrangement with this hotel at the re-
quest of her wealthy affianced husband. In speaking of
this in his summing up, Mr. Choate says:
"That does not look like Mr. del Valle's generous ac-
commodations. Mr. del Valle was profuse, lavish. She
had the richest meats, the finest terrapin, wines of her own
choice, always, at Solari's. But here in a little four-by-
ten room, in the fourth story of the Hotel Royal, why,
gentlemen, that looks to me a little more like Fred-
erick Hammond, who wrote her name in the hotel
register!"
Mr. Choate. "Did the defendant select this name of
Livingston for you?"
Miss Martinez. "He merely told me to take an as-
258
---
------
sumed name, to go under some other name, --- and
I chose the name of Livingston."
The purpose of this line of questions was shown in
the summing up to have been as follows:
Now, gentlemen, you have all been married, I infer
from your appearance. \[Laughter.\] You have been
through this mill of an engagement to be married. No
matter what kind of a man he is, --- he
he may be as bad as
men are ever made, or from that all the way to the next
grade below the archangels, ― and I put it to you on your
judgment and common sense and your conscience, that
you cannot find a man who would take the betrothed of
his heart, the woman whom he had chosen to be his wife,
and the mother of his children, who would take her to a
hotel in the city of New York to live for a longer or
shorter period under an assumed name.
The plaintiff went to this hotel by the name of
Livingstone. It was a good selection! She says Del
Valle did not choose that name. She had already
passed by the name under which she could claim the
blood of all the Howards, but now she claimed alliance
with the noble stock of Livingstons."
Mr. Choate. "Did you object to it when he told you
to go there under an assumed name?"
Miss Martinez. "No, I did not."
---
Mr. Choate. You were entirely willing to go to a
strange hotel alone under an assumed name?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes. For a short while."
------
Mr. Choate. "I wish you would tell us again precisely
what it was that induced you to go to this strange hotel
under such circumstances?"
Miss Martinez. "Well, Mr. del Valle suggested that
perhaps it would be better for me. He did not wish to
have any trouble with my stepfather concerning my dis-
appearance, neither did I wish to give him any unneces-
sary trouble if my father should take any violent steps of
any kind, as he had so often threatened to do, and he
suggested that I should take a room somewhere at some
hotel, and see how papa would act."
Mr. Choate. How was papa to know anything about
it if you were under an assumed name?"
Miss Martinez. "Well, he
"Well, he certainly would know
something about it when I left home."
Mr. Choate. "And the plan was that he should know
about it?"
Miss Martinez. "Should know what?
Mr. Choate. "Should know that you had gone?"
Miss Martinez. "Why, of course."
Mr. Choate. "To this hotel?"
Miss Martinez. "No, not to the hotel. He knew that
I had left home, and my fear was that he would hire
detectives to search for me, and of course, if he discov-
ered me in Mr. del Valle's home, I could not answer for
the consequences."
Mr. Choate. "What consequences did you appre-
hend?"
260
------
Miss Martinez. "I apprehended that he would kill
Mr. del Valle and kill me."
Mr. Choate. " And rather than that, you were willing
go to this hotel in this manner?"
to
Miss Martinez. "Certainly, Mr. del Valle suggested
it." 1
Mr. Choate. "Do you know whether your father did
do anything because of your leaving?"
Miss Martinez. Yes, I know that he put a personal
in the Herald for me."
Mr. Choate. "Did you show this personal' to Mr.
del Valle?"
Miss Martinez. "I showed it to him."
Mr. Choate. Did you discover it in the Herald?"
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate. "The 'personal' in the Herald of the sec-
ond day of May, or about five days after you had reached
the hotel, is contained in this paper which I now show
you, isn't it?
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "Now after the second day of May,
therefore, you knew that this personal' had come from
your father, didn't you?"
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate. "After you knew that your father' was

exclaiming to the jury in his final argument, "What sort of an engaged young
lady is this !"
------
inconsolable and would make all satisfactory,' you did
not have any more fear of his shooting you or Mr. del
Valle either, did you?"
Miss Martinez. "I most certainly did. My father
was not to be relied upon in what he said at all. He
said a great many things which he never meant."
Mr. Choate. "Do you mean that he did not have a
good reputation for veracity?"
Miss Martinez. "Not at all. But I knew that he had
always threatened to shoot me and my husband, if I ever
had one, and I knew that he would not make ‘all satis-
factory,' and that is why I did not return home."
Mr. Choate. "Did you answer this personal'?"
Miss Martinez. "I did not."
Mr. Choate. "Did you take any notice of your un-
happy father?”
Miss Martinez. "I did not."
Mr. Choate. "Made no effort to console him?"
Miss Martinez. "I did not. I loved Mr. del Valle,
and went with Mr. del Valle and trusted him. I had
nothing to do with my father. My father had many
others to console him."
Mr. Choate. "While you were at the Hotel Royal
did you make a visit to the Central Park with Mr. del
Valle?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes, frequently we went up to the
Park and walked all round. It was the only chance I
had of going out when he took me up there."
------
Mr. Choate. "Do you remember anything you told
him at that time?"
Miss Martinez. "Nothing in particular."
Mr. Choate. "Did you tell him that your stepfather
had been using you brutally?'
Miss Martinez. "I did not. I never told him any
such thing."
Mr. Choate. "Did you say that you had to leave
home and go to the hotel because of the bad treatment
of your stepfather?"
Miss Martinez. "I never did tell him so."
Mr. Choate. Did you ever tell anybody that?"
Miss Martinez. "I could never tell any one so, be-
cause my stepfather never treated me badly."
Later in the trial Mrs. Quackenbos testified on the
part of the defendant that while she was visiting Mr.
del Valle's summer home at Poughkeepsie, she was
introduced to the plaintiff as "Miss Henriques, the
housekeeper," and that during the conversation that
followed she expressed her surprise at seeing so young a
lady in that position. Whereupon the plaintiff had re-
plied that she “had a mystery attached to her life, which
she would tell Mrs. Quackenbos and perhaps she would
then think differently." She testified that the plaintiff
had told her that her mother had married her uncle, and
that she lived very unhappily at home owing to her step-
father's constant overtures to her; that her stepfather
was enamored of her; that the plaintiff in making this
263
------
confession had used these words, "That is why I am
here, madame. My mamma asked Mr. del Valle to take
me from my home." The plaintiff told Mrs. Quacken-
bos that it was impossible for her to remain at home;
that she was almost exhausted from fighting for her
honor; and that her mother had begged Mr. del Valle
to take her away. In speaking of this evidence in the
summing up, Mr. Choate said: -
"Why, she said, gentlemen, that she had been driven
from her home by the amorous persecutions of her step-
father, and that her mother had besought Mr. del Valle
to take her to his house as his governess and house-
keeper. You can't rub that out, gentlemen, if you
dance on it all night with India-rubber shoes!"

*
Mr. Choate. When was it that the arrangements
were completed and the family moved to the summer
home in Poughkeepsie?"
66
*
Miss Martinez. "The 1st of June."
Mr. Choate. Did you go direct to Poughkeepsie
with Mr. del Valle and his children?"
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate. "Now, I understand you that until the
end of the first week of your stay at Mr. del Valle's
house in Poughkeepsie, that is until this 6th of June
which you have spoken about, and from the 14th of
January, when you first made Mr. del Valle's acquaint-
ance, he was uniformly kind and courteous?"
264
------
Miss Martinez. "Always."
Mr. Choate. " And there was not the least symptom
of impropriety in his conduct towards you?
Miss Martinez. "Never, sir. He never offered me
the slightest indignity on any occasion."
Mr. Choate. "And no approach towards impropriety
on his part?"
Miss Martinez. "Never. Not on any single occasion.
Not a breath of it."
Mr. Choate. "As to this occurrence of the 6th of
June, I understand you to say that after breakfast you
went up to your room and lay down?"
Miss Martinez. "I did."

Mr. Choate. "And
your usual habit?
Miss Martinez. "Yes, sir. It was not an everyday
habit; it was more of a Sunday habit."
Mr. Choate. What time of the day did you have
breakfast on that Sunday?"
Miss Martinez. "At eleven o'clock in the morn-
ing.”
Mr. Choate. “How do you fix the date?
Miss Martinez. "I think it is a day in a woman's life
that she can never forget."1
¹ Mr. Choate had in his hand at the time of this examination a letter
written by Adèle, the plaintiff's sister, who had just left Poughkeepsie, where
she had been making a visit, and in which she referred to her sister as being
"as happy as a queen." This letter was later offered in evidence.

hold at that time on that day? Who were they besides
yourself and Mr. del Valle?!
Miss Martinez. There were the two younger chil-
dren, Mr. Alvarez, and the servants."
Mr. Choate. "How many servants were there?
Miss Martinez. "There were seven servants."
Mr. Choate. "And your room was where?"
Miss Martinez. "My room was on the same floor with
the family and Mr. del Valle's and the children's, and
next to the nurse and the two younger children, --- all
the children, in fact."
Mr. Choate. "Now at breakfast who were present
that morning?"
(6
Miss Martinez. "The children, Mr. Alvarez, Mr. del
Valle, and myself."
Mr. Choate. "What time was it you finished break-
fast?"
Miss Martinez. "About half-past eleven or a quar-
ter to twelve, perhaps twelve o'clock; I do not re-
member."
Mr. Choate. "And how soon after you had finished
breakfast did you go to your room?"
Miss Martinez. " Immediately after."
Mr. Choate. "Did you go alone?"
266
------
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate. "What did you do?"
Miss Martinez. "I lay on my bed reading. I could
hear the children downstairs. They were on the ve-
randa. I heard their voices as they went away from
the house with the nurse."
Mr. Choate. "You remained on your bed, did you?"
Miss Martinez. "I did. I was interested in my
book and I commenced to read."
Mr. Choate. "Did you remain upon the bed from
the time you first took your place upon it until
Mr. del Valle had accomplished what you charged
upon him yesterday?
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate. And were not off the bed at all?”
Miss Martinez. "I was not. I had partially arisen
when he entered."
""
Mr. Choate. "The door of your room opened into
the centre of the house, did it not?"
Miss Martinez. "It did."
Mr. Choate. Did you close the door?"
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate. Did you lock it?"
Miss Martinez. "I did not."
Mr. Choate. "Did you hear any other sound before
Mr. del Valle appeared in your room?”
Miss Martinez. "I did not. Merely the children's
receding voices in the distance."

Mr. Choate. This was a warm summer day, was
it not?"
Miss Martinez. “It was.
Mr. Choate. "Were the windows open?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "Did Mr. del Valle knock upon the
door?"
The sixth of June."
Miss Martinez. "He did not."
Mr. Choate. "You heard the door open?"
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate. "You saw him enter?
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate. "And were you lying upon the bed?"
Miss Martinez. "I was."
Mr. Choate. " Did you get up from the bed?”
Miss Martinez. “I just attempted to rise.”
Mr. Choate. "Who prevented you?"
Miss Martinez. "He came over to me and sat down
on the side of the bed."
Mr. Choate. "Did he shut the door?"
Miss Martinez. "He did."
Mr. Choate. "W While he was doing that did you at-
tempt to rise?"
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate. "Why didn't you rise?"
Miss Martinez. "Because I could not.
He came
over to me before I had partially risen."
Mr. Choate. "Do you mean to say that in the time
268
------
of his coming in and presenting himself and opening
and shutting the door, there was not time for you to
spring up from the bed?"
Miss Martinez. "There was not, because he was
already half in the room before I heard that he was
in. I was engaged in reading at the time, and he had
opened the door very softly."
Mr. Choate. "Was there time for you to begin to
start from the bed?"
Miss Martinez. "Well,
Well, I do not know. I did not
study the time."
Mr. Choate. How long was he in your room that
morning?"
Miss Martinez. "I cannot say exactly."
66
Mr. Choate. "You can say whether he was there an
hour, or two hours, or half an hour?"
Miss Martinez. "Well, he was there about an hour."
Mr. Choate. " Did you make an outcry while he was
in the room?"
Miss Martinez. "No, I did not scream."
Mr. Choate. "Did not attempt to scream, did you?"
Miss Martinez. "No, I did not attempt to scream.
I remonstrated with him."
Mr. Choate. "Did you speak in a loud voice?"
Miss Martinez. "Well, not to be heard all over
the house, but if anybody had been in the room he
would have heard me."
Mr. Choate. Did you speak low?"
269
------
Miss Martinez. "Lower than I am speaking now."
Mr. Choate. "You did not make any effort to make
yourself heard by anybody in the house, or outside?"
Miss Martinez. "No, I was not afraid of Mr. del
Valle. I did not think he came into my room to murder
me, nor to hurt me."
Mr. Choate. "You found out, according to your story,
what he did come for, after a while, didn't you?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "And before he accomplished his pur-
pose?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. Now, didn't you speak above a low
voice then?".
Miss Martinez. "Well, perhaps I did."
Mr. Choate. "Well, did you?"
Miss Martinez. "I think I did."
Mr. Choate. "Well, did you scream out?"
Miss Martinez. "I did not."
Mr. Choate. Did you call out?"
Miss Martinez. "I did not."
Mr. Choate. Did you speak loud enough to be heard
by any of the servants below, or anybody in the hall
or on the veranda?"
Miss Martinez. "I do not think anybody could have
heard me."
Mr. Choate. "Why didn't you cry out?"
Miss Martinez. "Because

he told me not to.'
------
Mr. Choate. " Oh, he told you not to?”
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "Then it was a spirit of obedience to
him."
Miss Martinez. "Just as you please to look upon it."
Mr. Choate. Just as I please to look upon it'?"
Well, I look upon it so. Now you say that you do not
think he had any evil purpose when he came into the
room?
Miss Martinez. "No, I cannot believe he did."
Mr. Choate. And you do not think so now?"
Miss Martinez. "Oh, I do think so now, certainly."
Mr. Choate. "You did not think so then?"
Miss Martinez. "No, I did not when he entered the
room."
Mr. Choate. There was nothing indicating an evil
purpose on his part?"
Miss Martinez. "No, I do not think so."
""
Mr. Choate. "How long had he been there before
there was anything on his part that indicated to you
any evil intent?"
Miss Martinez. About fifteen minutes."
Mr. Choate. "Before you had the least idea of any
evil intent on his part?"
Miss Martinez. "Well, I did not then think he had
any evil intent."
Mr. Choate. "Were you fully dressed that morning?"
Miss Martinez. "Fully dressed."
271
------
Mr. Choate. "And fully dressed when he came into
the room?"
Miss Martinez. "Fully dressed."
Mr. Choate. "Just as you had been at breakfast?"
Miss Martinez. "Just the very same."
Mr. Choate. "You were lying on the bed. Where
was he?"
Miss Martinez. "He was also on the bed."
Mr. Choate. "Sitting by your side?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. And you and he were engaged in
conversation, were you?"
Miss Martinez. "We were."
Mr. Choate. Sometime during that hour you became
partly undressed, I suppose. When was that?"
Miss Martinez. How do you know I became partly
undressed?"
66
66
Mr. Choate. "I judge so from what you have stated.
I beg your pardon. Did you, or did you not?”
Miss Martinez. "No, I did not become undressed.
Merely Mr. del Valle took my belt off. I had a wrapper
on. I had a black silk belt."
Mr. Choate. "You had a belt? How was that secured?"
Miss Martinez. "Just merely by hook and eye. It
was a black silk ribbon belt."
Mr. Choate. "And that became unhooked?
Miss Martinez. "It did not become unhooked; Mr.
del Valle unhooked it."
272
------
Mr. Choate. "What
was it
What was it you did when he unhooked
the belt? Did you cry out?
Miss Martinez. "No, I did not cry out. I told you
I made no outcry whatever."
Mr. Choate had made his point. Immediately the
idea flashed across his mind that if he stopped here
he had one of the opportunities of his life for the sum-
ming up. This is how he made use of it:
-
“Gentlemen of the jury: This is not a story of Lucre-
tia and Tarquin, who came with his sword. Oh, no,
there was not any sword. They conversed together.
There is not a word as to what was said, and after a
while, the story is, he unbuckled her belt and then it
was all over! On the unloosening of her belt, she went
all to pieces! Gentlemen, my question to you, which
I want you to take to the jury room and answer, is
whether, under such circumstances, by the mere un-
doing of that hook and eye, and the unloosening of
that belt, a woman would go all to pieces unless there
was something of a very loose woman behind the belt!
All the household was there. Why did she not cry
out? Why did she not raise that gentle-tempered voice
of hers a little? A silent seduction, by her own story!”

while, did he not?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes, he did. My mother revealed
the fact to him that I was at Poughkeepsie and engaged
to be married to Mr. del Valle, and insisted upon his
acting reasonably."
Mr. Choate. "And he did act reasonably, did he not?"

Mr. Choate. And your father stayed to dinner?"
Miss Martinez. "He did."
Mr. Choate. "Did he make any threats?"
Miss Martinez. "He did not."
Mr. Choate. Did he exhibit any violence?"
Miss Martinez. "He did not."
Mr. Choate. Then all your fears proved to have been
unfounded, didn't they?"
Miss Martinez. "Not at all."
Mr. Choate. "You think that after all, if you had
married Mr. del Valle, he would have carried his threats
into execution?"
Miss Martinez. "I think he would, most certainly."
Mr. Choate. And yet he came up pleasantly and
spent the day with Mr. del Valle and you at Mr. del
Valle's house, knowing that you were living in his
house?"
66
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "Upon a promise of marriage?"
Miss Martinez. "He did."
Mr. Choate.
66
Did he try to dissuade you from marry-
ing?"
Miss Martinez. "He did not."
Mr. Choate. "And yet you think that if you married,
he would have shot you and Mr. del Valle?"
Miss Martinez. “I do most certainly think so.”
*
------
Mr. Choate. Miss Martinez, did you write a letter,
dated September 8, to Mr. del Valle? "¹
Miss Martinez. "I did.”
Mr. Choate. "Is this the letter which I now show
you?"
Miss Martinez. "Well, it may be, but I would not
swear to it."
Mr. Choate. "Will you swear it is not?"
Miss Martinez. "No, I would not swear it is not."
Mr. Choate. "In this letter you say, 'I have been
very happy in your house'?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "That was true, was it not?"
Miss Martinez. "It was very true."
Mr. Choate. "During that period was it true that
you were very happy' in his house?"
Miss Martinez. “Until the 6th of June, the Sunday
(
told you about a little while ago."
Mr. Choate. "That was four days?"
Miss Martinez. "Well, that was some time."
Mr. Choate. "You got there on the night of the 1st,
didn't you?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes, I did.”
Mr. Choate. And your happiness came to an end on
the morning of the 6th?"
¹ The student's attention is directed to this extremely clever use, in cross-
examination, of a letter which was wholly inconsistent with the story of her
stay at Poughkeepsie, which the plaintiff had already sworn to.
276
------
Miss Martinez. "Yes, it did."
Mr. Choate. "And that was what you meant when
you wrote, 'I have been very happy in your house'?"
Miss Martinez. "I did, and up to the time when I
heard of the compromise not being adjusted."
Mr. Choate. " Oh, you were very happy till then?'
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "I will always think of the many happy
hours spent with you.' What did you mean by 'the
many happy hours'?"
Miss Martinez. "What did I mean by it?"
Mr. Choate. "Yes, what hours did you mean?"
Miss Martinez. "I meant the hours that I spent with
Mr. del Valle and which were happy."
Mr. Choate. Before the 6th of June?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. And none after?"
Miss Martinez. "Not many."
Mr. Choate. "Then your object in writing this letter
was to thank him for the many happy hours spent with
him between the afternoon of the 1st of June, when
you arrived, and the morning of the 6th of June,
was it?"
Miss Martinez. "It was."
Mr. Choate. "And which were the only ones I have
ever known.' What did you mean by that, to com-
pare the hours of those four days of June with all the
previous hours of your life?'
277
------
Miss Martinez. "I meant with all the previous hours
of my life I had never been happy in all my life."
Mr. Choate. "As in those four days?'
Miss Martinez. "No."
Mr. Choate. What was it that prevented your being
equally happy from the time of your engagement down
to the 1st of June?"
Miss Martinez. "Oh, I don't think it was a very
happy state of mind I was in, to be engaged to Mr. del
Valle and could not see him as I wished to, occasionally
in the evenings. I was restricted."
Mr. Choate. "It was the restrictions that were placed
upon your seeing Mr. del Valle, and yet you saw him
eight times a week, I think you testified, and every day
you spent hours in his company?"
Miss Martinez. Not every day."
Mr. Choate. "Well, whenever you met?"
Miss Martinez. “Yes."
Mr. Choate. And you were alone together?"
Miss Martinez. “We were."
Mr. Choate. "And his conduct towards you during
all these hours was absolutely unquestionable?'
Miss Martinez. "Unquestionable."
66
Mr. Choate. "Why, then, did you say that the hours
of the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th of June that you spent
with him, were the only happy hours that you had ever
known compared with the previous hours spent with
Mr. del Valle?"
278
------
Miss Martinez. "It was just merely from the fact
that my father's manner and way towards me made
me always unhappy."
Mr. Choate. That is, the fear that your father, if he
found it out, would shoot you and your intended?"
Miss Martinez. It was."
Mr. Choate. "You still had that fear during the 2d,
3d, 4th, and 5th of June, it seems, didn't you?"
Miss Martinez. "No, I didn't have that fear as much
as I had."
Mr. Choate. "You said that was not dissipated until
your father's second visit in August."
Miss Martinez. "So it was not, but I did not have as
much fear then as I had before."
Mr. Choate. "Oh, because your father was in New
York and you at Poughkeepsie?"
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "I leave it to God to grant you the
reward you so much deserve, and which is impossible
for you to receive on this earth.' Reward for what,
do you mean?"
Miss Martinez. "Oh, I had a conversation with Mr.
del Valle before I wrote that letter to him.”
Mr. Choate. "I am asking you now the meaning of
this letter. What acts and conduct of his was it, taken
all together, that you left it to God to reward him for,
because it was impossible for him to have any reward on
earth for it?'
279
------
Miss Martinez. "I did not mean at all what I
wrote."
Mr. Choate. "Oh, you did not mean what you
wrote?'
Miss Martinez. "No, I did not. I merely wished to
keep Mr. del Valle as my friend."
Mr. Choate. Are you in the habit now of writing
what you do not mean?"
Miss Martinez. “I am certainly not in the habit.”
Mr. Choate. "But this you did not mean at all, did
you?"
Miss Martinez. "Oh, I meant some of it, some I
didn't."
Mr. Choate. How much of it did you mean? Did
you mean that you 'left it to God to grant the reward
he so much deserved'; or did you mean that it was
impossible for him to receive that reward on earth'?
Which part of it did you mean?"
Miss Martinez. "I meant no part of that."
Mr. Choate. Did you understand that Mr. del Valle
was to come and see you in New York?"
Miss Martinez. "I did, certainly."
Mr. Choate. "And so you understood when you
wrote this letter?"
Miss Martinez. "I did."
Mr. Choate. "Now you began, 'My dear friend, it
may be that I may never see you again.' What did
you mean by that?"
66
280
(
------
Miss Martinez.
Because I doubted his word, and
thought perhaps I should never see Mr. del Valle again,
treating me as he had."
Mr. Choate. "You doubted his word, and you wrote
him what you did not mean at all. Does that represent
the real state of the relations between you at that
time?"
Miss Martinez. "Well, the relations between us at
the time would be very difficult indeed to define."
Mr. Choate. "I will complete the first sentence,
‘still, I feel that I cannot leave your house without
thanking you for all your kindness to me.""
Miss Martinez. "Mr. del Valle always was very kind
to me, always."
Mr. Choate. And you thought that, taking his whole
conduct together from the beginning to the end of your
stay, it was incumbent upon you not to leave without
thanking him for all his kindness to you. Is that so?”
Miss Martinez. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "And you meant that, didn't you?"
Miss Martinez. "Well, no, I didn't mean it exactly."
Mr. Choate. "I have been very happy in your
house.' Did you mean that?"
Miss Martinez. "I was very happy in his house and
“I
I was very miserable."
Mr. Choate. "After you got to New York, Mr. del
Valle did not come to see you?'
Miss Martinez. "He did not."
281
------
Mr. Choate. "And you have never seen him since
until you saw him in this court room?"
Miss Martinez. "I have not.
*
Mr. Choate. "In those visits to Solari's you spoke of
the other day, did you always have a private room, no
one being present but yourselves and the waiter?"
Miss Martinez. "We did have a private room."
Mr. Choate. Did you always have the same room?"
Miss Martinez. "No, not always."
Mr. Choate. How many different private rooms
should you think you had at Solari's ?
Miss Martinez. "I can't tell you
how many
ones, perhaps two or three."
Mr. Choate. Was Mr. del Valle's demeanor to you
on such occasions the same as it was when you were
in your mother's house and in the street, and in public
places like the opera and matinée?"
Miss Martinez. Always the same in a private room
as he was at home when my mother was not there. He
used to kiss me frequently, but he never kissed me at
matinées, nor did he kiss me in the street. Our inter-
course and behavior, therefore, must have been dif-
ferent."
282
different
Mr. Choate. "Otherwise it was the same?"
Miss Martinez. "Always most respectful."
Mr. Choate. "As to his kisses, of course you made
no objection?'
------
Miss Martinez. None at all."
Mr. Choate. "How long were these interviews at
Solari's, these meetings when you went there and had
a private room generally? "
Miss Martinez. "They varied in length. Sometimes
we arrived there at two o'clock and remained until four,
- sometimes we arrived there a little earlier."
Mr. Choate. "About a couple of hours."
Miss Martinez. Two or three hours."
Mr. Choate. What were you doing all that time?
Miss Martinez. "We were eating."
Mr. Choate. What, not eating all the time?"
Miss Martinez. "Eating all the time."
Mr. Choate. Two hours eating! Well, you must
have grown fat during that period!"
Miss Martinez. "Well, perhaps you eat much quicker
than I do."
66
Mr. Choate. You think you ate all that time?”
Miss Martinez. "Well, I do not say we gormandized
continually."
Mr. Choate. " But pretty constantly eating; that was
the only business?"
Miss Martinez. First we had our dinner and then
there was a digression of about half an hour before we
called for dessert. That perhaps took
That perhaps took up another hour."
Mr. Choate. " During that 'digression' what did you
generally do?"
Miss Martinez. "We used to talk."
283
------
Mr. Choate. "How did Mr. del Valle progress with
his English?"
Miss Martinez. "Very well indeed. Remarkably
well."
Mr. Choate. "Did you practise English at Solari's?"
Miss Martinez. " Yes, frequently."
Mr. Choate. "That was a pretty constant occupation
at all your meetings in those private rooms at Solari's,
wasn't it, --- practising or speaking English?"
Miss Martinez. "We frequently spoke about the
rules of the language."
Mr. Choate. "Did his English during these intervals
improve?"
Miss Martinez. "I think it did."
Mr. Choate.
66
And you did all you could to improve
it, I suppose?"
Miss Martinez. "Undeniably so."
Mr. Choate. "You even had a book of conversation
with you?"
Miss Martinez. "We had."
Mr. Choate. And did he make great efforts at those
times to improve and advance his English?"
Miss Martinez. "I believe he did."
Referring in his summing up to this part of the
examination, Mr. Choate said: -
“What I am endeavoring to show you, gentlemen, is
that the action of the parties does not confirm this idea
of a promise of marriage, because from what you have
284
------
heard of this place, from the sentiment which has made
itself apparent in this court room whenever the name
Solari was mentioned, I think you will bear me out in
saying that it is not a place where ladies and gentle-
men go for courtship with a view to matrimony. From
what you know of the place, if you had made the ac-
quaintance of a young woman and become betrothed
to her, is it to Solari's you would go to do your court-
ing with a view to matrimony? All of us, every jury-
man, will say 'No,' and will you not judge the
defendant as you judge yourselves ?
"The defendant was tickled, attracted, and pleased.
Here was a woman who could speak his own language
and they could pick up the broken fragments of his
English and her Spanish, and put them together, and
he liked nothing better, and so they went to Solari's!
"Well, gentlemen, I do not know anything about
Solari's except what is shown here upon the evidence.
So far as I can make out, however, people go to Solari's
for all sorts of purposes. Men go there with ladies,
ladies with ladies, men with men, theatre parties, family
parties, matinée parties, -all sorts of parties, and these
parties went there together. But under the develop-
ments of this case, Solari's assumes new importance
and acquires a new fame. It is no longer a mere res-
taurant. It is no longer a mere place of refreshment
for the body, where you can get meat and wine and
whatever is pleasant for the inner mind; it now attains
285
------
celebrity as a new school of learning, patronized, brought
into notice, by my client and the fair plaintiff as a place
where you can go to drink of the Fountain of Knowl-
edge. \[Laughter.\] They had a 'Guide to Conversation.'
"I think the fair plaintiff said that there were ‘digres-
sions' there. They ate and drank, - she thinks they ate
and drank for two hours at a time, but I compelled her
to say that there was an intermediate 'digression.'
What there was in the digressions does not exactly
appear; for one thing, there was this 'Guide to Con-
versation,' but there were limits even to the regions to
which this Guide led them, for they both agreed that it
did not bring them even to the vestibule of Criminal
Conversation, which is a very important point to con-
sider in connection with the history of these meetings
at Solari's." \[Roars of laughter.\]
Mr. Choate. " During the period of your engagement
from early in February down to the time of going to
Poughkeepsie, did you ever, while with Mr. del Valle,
fall in with any of his friends or acquaintances?"
Miss Martinez. "I did, on several occasions."
Mr. Choate. "Were you introduced?"
Miss Martinez. “No, but on one occasion some of his
friends were at the matinée." 1
¹ When speaking of this phase of the case to the jury, Mr. Choate said, “I
will say this, that where there is a betrothal, the parties do give some symp-
toms of it sooner or later. You cannot prevent their showing it, and there is

------
Mr. Choate. Were you introduced to them there,
and if so, who were they?
Miss Martinez. "I was not."
Mr. Choate. "During the period of this engagement,
as you say, to you, did he introduce you at all to any-
body?"
Miss Martinez. During the period of our engage-
ment?"
""
Mr. Choate. "Yes."
Miss Martinez. "No, I think not."
Mr. Choate. "Then he certainly did not introduce
you to anybody as his intended wife?"
Miss Martinez. "He did not. I was not introduced
to anybody."
Mr. Choate. "When you were at Poughkeepsie did
any person come to the house to make a visit?"
Miss Martinez. "They did."
Mr. Choate. "Were you introduced to them?"
Miss Martinez. "I was."
Mr. Choate. "By whom?
Miss Martinez. "By Mr. del Valle."
Mr. Choate. "How?"
Miss Martinez. "As the instructress of his children,
or governess, or something of that kind.”
Mr Choate. "Never in all that time did he introduce
you to anybody as his intended wife?"
no suggestion of evidence that anybody saw these parties together acting
towards each other as though they were engaged."
287
------
Miss Martinez. "No, he did not wish anybody to
know it, he said."
Mr. Choate. "When did he say that?'
Miss Martinez. "He told me so when he expected
Mrs. Quackenbos' visit before she arrived."
Mr. Choate. "That was some three months after your
engagement?"
Miss Martinez. "It was.'
Mr. Choate. He did not intimate for the first three
months a desire that nobody should know, did he?"
Miss Martinez. "He never said a word to me about
any one's knowing anything about it."
Mr. Choate. "And if there was any concealment, it
was not on his part?"
Miss Martinez. “It was not, nor on my part either."
Mr. Choate. "Nor his desire?"
66
Miss Martinez. Nor on my part either.”
This gave Mr. Choate an opportunity for this final
shaft at the plaintiff in his summing up:
"You see, gentlemen, what an immense advantage it
would be for her, for this family, if they could make
this consolidated Virginia,' in the form of my client,
their own. They had no possible means of support; he
hove in sight, a craft laden, as they supposed, with treas-
ure for themselves. If there had been this engagement
of marriage, the world would have heard of it. I don't
mean the World newspaper ---it hears of everything
but all the world that surrounds the Henriques and
288
"
-
------
Martinez family. The news would have spread that
they had captured a prize and brought it into court for
condemnation!"
After deliberating for twenty-six hours the jury re-
turned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and assessed
the damages at $50.

CHAPTER XIII
THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF RICHARD PIGOTT BY SIR CHARLES
RUSSELL BEFORE THE PARNELL COMMISSION
PROBABLY one of the most dramatic and successful of
the more celebrated cross-examinations in the history
of the English courts is Sir Charles Russell's cross-
examination of Pigott, the chief witness in the investi-
gation growing out of the attack upon Charles S. Parnell
and sixty-five Irish members of Parliament, by name, for
belonging to a lawless and even murderous organization,
whose aim was the overthrow of English rule.
This cross-examination is in marked contrast with the
method used by Mr. Choate in his cross-examination of
the plaintiff in the Martinez case in the preceding chapter.
During the entire cross-examination of Miss Martinez,
Mr. Choate carefully concealed from her the fact that he
had in his possession a letter written by her. with which
he intended to and did destroy her, in his summing up.
But here the opposite method was adopted by Sir
Charles Russell, and after adroitly leading Pigott to
commit himself irretrievably to certain absolute state-
ments, Russell suddenly confronted him with his own
letters in a way that was masterly and deadly to Pigott.
The case is also an admirable illustration of the
290
------
importance of so using a damaging letter that a dishonest
witness cannot escape its effect by ready and ingenious
explanations, when given an opportunity, as is often done
by an unskilful cross-examiner. Attention has already
been drawn to this vital point in the chapter upon the
proper "Sequence of Cross-Examination."
The cross-
examination of Pigott shows that Sir Charles Russell
thoroughly understood this branch of the art, for he
read to Pigott only a portion of his damaging letter, and
then mercilessly impaled him upon the sharp points of
his questions before dragging him forward in a bleeding
condition to face other portions of his letter, and repeated
the process until Pigott was cut to pieces.
The principal charge against Parnell, and the only one
that interests us in the cross-examination of the witness
Pigott, was the writing of a letter by Parnell which the
Times claimed to have obtained and published in
facsimile, in which he excused the murderer of Lord
Frederick Cavendish, Chief Secretary for Ireland, and of
Mr. Burke, Under Secretary, in Phoenix Park, Dublin,
on May 6, 1882. One particular sentence in the letter
read, “I cannot refuse to admit that Burke got no more
than his deserts."
The publication of this letter naturally made a great
stir in Parliament and in the country at large. Parnell
stated in the House of Commons that the letter was a
forgery, and later asked for the appointment of a select
committee to inquire whether the facsimile letter was
------
a forgery. The Government refused this request, but
appointed a special committee, composed of three judges,
to investigate all the charges made by the Times.
The writer is indebted again to Russell's biographer,
Mr. O'Brien, for the details of this celebrated case.
Seldom has any legal controversy been so graphically
described as this one. One seems to be living with
Russell, and indeed with Mr. O'Brien himself, through-
out those eventful months. We must content ourselves,
however, with a reproduction of the cross-examination
of Pigott as it comes from the stenographer's minutes
of the trial, enlightened by the pen of Russell's facile
biographer.
Mr. O'Brien speaks of it as "the event in the life of
Russell the defence of Parnell." In order to under-
take this defence, Russell returned to the Times the
retainer he had enjoyed from them for many previous
years. It was known that the Times had bought the
letter from Mr. Houston, the secretary of the Irish
Loyal and Patriotic Union, and that Mr. Houston had
bought it from Pigott. But how did Pigott come by
it? That was the question of the hour, and people
looked forward to the day when Pigott should go into
the box to tell his story, and when Sir Charles Russell
should rise to cross-examine him. Mr. O'Brien writes:
Pigott's evidence in chief, so far as the letter was con-
cerned, came practically to this: he had been employed
by the Irish Loyal and Patriotic Union to hunt up
------
documents which might incriminate Parnell, and he had
bought the facsimile letter, with other letters, in Paris
from an agent of the Clan-na-Gael, who had no objection
to injuring Parnell for a valuable consideration.
During the whole week or more Russell had looked
pale, worn, anxious, nervous, distressed. He was impa-
tient, irritable, at times disagreeable. Even at luncheon,
half an hour before, he seemed to be thoroughly out of
sorts, and gave you the idea rather of a young junior
with his first brief than of the most formidable advocate
at the Bar. Now all was changed. As he stood facing
Pigott, he was a picture of calmness, self-possession,
strength; there was no sign of impatience or irritabil-
ity; not a trace of illness, anxiety, or care; a slight tinge
of color lighted up the face, the eyes sparkled, and a
pleasant smile played about the mouth. The whole
bearing and manner of the man, as he proudly turned
his head toward the box, showed courage, resolution,
confidence. Addressing the witness with much courtesy,
while a profound silence fell upon the crowded court, he
began: 'Mr. Pigott, would you be good enough, with
my Lords' permission, to write some words on that sheet
of paper for me? Perhaps you will sit down in order to
do so?' A sheet of paper was then handed to the wit-
ness. I thought he looked for a moment surprised.
This clearly was not the beginning that he had ex-
pected. He hesitated, seemed confused. Perhaps Rus-
sell observed it. At all events he added quickly:
-
------
"Would you like to sit down?'
Oh, no, thanks,' replied Pigott, a little flurried.
The President. 'Well, but I think it is better that
you should sit down. Here is a table upon which you
can write in the ordinary way-the course you always
pursue.'
Pigott sat down and seemed to recover his equi-
librium.
Russell. Will you write the word "livelihood "?"
Pigott wrote.
Russell. Just leave a space. Will you write the
word "likelihood "?"
Pigott wrote.
Russell. Will you write your own name? Will
you write the word "proselytism," and finally (I think
I will not trouble you at present with any more) “ Pat-
rick Egan" and " P. Egan"?'
"He uttered these last words with emphasis, as if they
imported something of great importance. Then, when
Pigott had written, he added carelessly, 'There is one
word I had forgotten. Lower down, please, leaving
spaces, write the word “hesitancy."" Then, as Pigott
was about to write, he added, as if this were the vital
point, 'with a small "h." Pigott wrote and looked
relieved.
(
(
(
1
(
"Russell. Will you kindly give me the sheet?'
Pigott took up a bit of blotting paper to lay on
the sheet, when Russell, with a sharp ring in his voice,
------
said rapidly, 'Don't blot it, please.' It seemed to me
that the sharp ring in Russell's voice startled Pigott.
While writing he had looked composed; now again he
looked flurried, and nervously handed back the sheet.
The attorney general looked keenly at it, and then said,
with the air of a man who had himself scored, 'My
Lords, I suggest that had better be photographed, if
your Lordships see no objection.'
"Russell (turning sharply toward the attorney general,
and with an angry glance and an Ulster accent, which
sometimes broke out when he felt irritated). 'Do not
interrupt my cross-examination with that request.'
Little did the attorney general at that moment know
that, in the ten minutes or quarter of an hour which it
had taken to ask these questions, Russell had gained a
decisive advantage. Pigott had in one of his letters to
Pat Egan spelt 'hesitancy' thus, 'hesitency.' In one of
the incriminatory letters 'hesitancy' was so spelt; and
in the sheet now handed back to Russell, Pigott had
written 'hesitency,' too. In fact it was Pigott's spelling
of this word that had put the Irish members on his
scent. Pat Egan, seeing the word spelt with an ‘e'in
one of the incriminatory letters, had written to Parnell,
saying in effect, Pigott is the forger. In the letter
ascribed to you “hesitancy” is spelt "hesitency." That
is the way Pigott always spells the word.' These things
were not dreamt of in the philosophy of the attorney
general when he interrupted Russell's cross-examination
66
(
295
------
with the request that the sheet ‘had better be photo-
graphed.' So closed the first round of the combat.
"Russell went on in his former courteous manner, and
Pigott, who had now completely recovered confidence,
looked once more like a man determined to stand to his
guns.
Russell, having disposed of some preliminary points.
at length (and after he had been perhaps about half an
hour on his feet), closed with the witness.
Russell. The first publication of the articles " Par-
nellism and Crime " was on the 7th March, 1887?'
66
(
Pigott (sturdily). 'I do not know.'
" Russell (amiably). Well, you may assume that is the
date.'
Pigott (carelessly). ‘I suppose so.'
"Russell. And you were aware of the intended
publication of the correspondence, the incriminatory
letters?'
Pigott (firmly). 'No, I was not at all aware of it.'
Russell (sharply, and with the Ulster ring in his
voice). 'What? '
"Pigott (boldly). No, certainly not.'
(
*
Russell. 'Were you not aware that there were grave
charges to be made against Mr. Parnell and the leading
members of the Land League?'
Pigott (positively). ‘I was not aware of it until they
actually commenced.'
296
------
“Russell (again with the Ulster ring). ‘What?’
'Pigott (defiantly). 'I was not aware of it until the
publication actually commenced.'
"Russell (pausing, and looking straight at the witness).
'Do you swear that? '
Pigott (aggressively). 'I do.'
" Russell (making a gesture with both hands, and look-
ing toward the bench). Very good, there is no mistake
about that.'
Then there was a pause; Russell placed his hands
beneath the shelf in front of him, and drew from it some
papers Pigott, the attorney general, the judges, every
one in court looking intently at him the while. There
was not a breath, not a movement. I think it was the
most dramatic scene in the whole cross-examination,
abounding as it did in dramatic scenes. Then, handing
Pigott a letter, Russell said calmly:
"Is that your letter? Do not trouble to read it; tell
me if it is your letter.'
Pigott took the letter, and held it close to his eyes
as if reading it.
Russell (sharply). Do not trouble to read it.'
"Pigott. 'Yes, I think it is.'
"
Russell (with a frown). Have you any doubt of it?'
Pigott. 'No.'
Russell (addressing the judges). 'My Lords, it is
from Anderton's Hotel, and it is addressed by the wit-
ness to Archbishop Walsh. The date, my Lords, is the

4th of March, three days before the first appearance of
the first of the articles, "Parnellism and Crime."
"He then read:
"Private and confidential.'
"My Lord: The importance of the matter about
which I write will doubtless excuse this intrusion on
your Grace's attention. Briefly, I wish to say that I
have been made aware of the details of certain proceed-
ings that are in preparation with the object of destroying
the influence of the Parnellite party in Parliament.'
'Having read this much Russell turned to Pigott and
said:
"What were the certain proceedings that were in
preparation?'
(
"Pigott. I do not recollect.'
"Russell (resolutely). Turn to my Lords and repeat
the answer.'
Pigott. 'I do not recollect.”
Russell. You swear that writing on the 4th of
March, less than two years ago?'
Pigott. 'Yes.'
Russell. You do not know what that referred to?'
(
(
Pigott. I do not really.'
"Russell. May I suggest to you?'
(
Pigott. 'Yes, you may.'
"Russell. 'Did it refer to the incriminatory letters
among other things?'
"Pigott. 'Oh, at that date? No, the letters had not
298
------
been obtained, I think, at that date, had they, two years
ago?'
(
"Russell (quietly and courteously). I do not want to
confuse you at all, Mr. Pigott.'
"Pigott. Would you mind giving me the date of
that letter?'
(
"Russell. The 4th of March.'
Pigott. The 4th of March.'
"Russell. Is it your impression that the letters had
not been obtained at that date?"
"Pigott. 'Oh, yes, some of the letters had been ob-
tained before that date.'
Russell. Then, reminding you that some of the
letters had been obtained before that date, did that pas-
sage that I have read to you in that letter refer to these
letters among other things?'
(
(
(
Pigott. No, I rather fancy they had reference to
the forthcoming articles in the Times.'
Russell (glancing keenly at the witness). I thought
you told us you did not know anything about the forth-
coming articles.'
"Pigott (looking confused). 'Yes, I did. I find now
I am mistaken that I must have heard something
about them.'
Russell (severely). Then try not to make the same
mistake again, Mr. Pigott. "Now," you go on (continu-
ing to read from Pigott's letter to the archbishop), “ I
cannot enter more fully into details than to state that the
(
------
proceedings referred to consist in the publication of cer-
tain statements purporting to prove the complicity of
Mr. Parnell himself, and some of his supporters, with
murders and outrages in Ireland, to be followed, in all
probability, by the institution of criminal proceedings
against these parties by the Government."
“Having finished the reading, Russell laid down the
letter and said (turning toward the witness), 'Who told
you that?'
"Pigott. I have no idea.'
Russell (striking the paper energetically with his
fingers). But that refers, among other things, to the
incriminatory letters.'
"Pigott. 'I do not recollect that it did.'
"Russell (with energy). 'Do you swear that it did not?'
"Pigott. I will not swear that it did not.'
(
"Russell. 'Do you think it did?'
"Pigott. No, I do not think it did.'
"Russell. 'Do you think that these letters, if genuine,
would prove or would not prove Parnell's complicity in
crime?'
(
(
(
"Pigott. I thought they would be very likely to
prove it.'
Russell. Now, reminding you of that opinion, I ask
you whether you did not intend to refer - not solely, I
suggest, but among other things
to the letters as being
the matter which would prove complicity or purport to
prove complicity?'
------
Pigott. 'Yes, I may have had that in my mind.'
Russell. You could have had hardly any doubt that
you had?'
(
"Pigott. 'I suppose so.'
"Russell. You suppose you may have had?'
Pigott. 'Yes.'
Russell. There is the letter and the statement
(reading), "Your Grace may be assured that I speak with
full knowledge, and am in a position to prove, beyond all
doubt and question, the truth of what I say." Was that
true?'
66
6
6
6
"Pigott. It could hardly be true.'
Russell.
6
Then did you write that which was false?'
"Pigott. I suppose it was in order to give strength
to what I said. I do not think it was warranted by what
I knew.'
6
Russell. 'You added the untrue statement in order
to add strength to what you said?'
Pigott. 'Yes.'
Russell. You believe these letters to be genuine?'
Pigott. 'I do.'
Russell. And did at this time?'
6
(
"Pigott. 'Yes.'
Russell (reading). ‹“And I will further assure your
Grace that I am also able to point out how these designs
may be successfully combated and finally defeated." How,
if these documents were genuine documents, and you be-
lieved them to be such, how were you able to assure his
------
Grace that you were able to point out how the design
might be successfully combated and finally defeated ? '
"Pigott. 'Well, as I say, I had not the letters actually
in my mind at that time. So far as I can gather, I do
not recollect the letter to Archbishop Walsh at all. My
memory is really a blank on the circumstance.'
"Russell. "You told me a moment ago, after great
deliberation and consideration, you had both the in-
criminatory letters and the letter to Archbishop Walsh
in your mind.'
(
Pigott. I said it was probable I did; but I say the
thing has completely faded out of my mind.'
(
"Russell (resolutely). I must press you. Assuming
the letters to be genuine, what were the means by which
you were able to assure his Grace that you could point
out how the design might be successfully combated and
finally defeated?'
Pigott (helplessly). 'I cannot conceive really.'
"Russell. 'Oh, try. You must really try.'
"Pigott (in manifest confusion and distress). 'I cannot.”
"Russell (looking fixedly at the witness). 'Try.'
Pigott. I cannot.'
"Russell. 'Try.'
"Pigott. It is no use.'
Russell (emphatically). May I take it, then, your
answer to my Lords is that you cannot give any ex-
planation?'
"Pigott. I really cannot absolutely.'
(
202
------
Russell (reading). ""I assure your Grace that I have
no other motive except to respectfully suggest that your
Grace would communicate the substance to some one
or other of the parties concerned, to whom I could fur-
nish details, exhibit proofs, and suggest how the coming
blow may be effectually met." What do you say to
that, Mr. Pigott?'
‘Pigott. I have nothing to say except that I do not
recollect anything about it absolutely.'
"Russell. What was the coming blow?'
(
Pigott. I suppose the coming publication.'
"Russell. How was it to be effectively met?'
Pigott. I have not the slightest idea.'
(
(
"Russell.
Assuming the letters to be genuine, does
it not even now occur to your mind how it could be
effectively met ?'
"Pigott. 'No.'
Pigott now looked like a man, after the sixth round
in a prize fight, who had been knocked down in every
round. But Russell showed him no mercy. I shall
take another extract.
"
"Russell. Whatever the charges in "Parnellism and
Crime," including the letters, were, did you believe them
to be true or not?'
6
Pigott. How can I say that when I say I do not
know what the charges were? I say I do not recollect
------
that letter to the archbishop at all, or any of the circum-
stances it refers to.'
“Russell. ‘First of all you knew this: that you pro-
cured and paid for a number of letters?'
Pigott. 'Yes.'
"Russell. Which, if genuine, you have already told
me, would gravely implicate the parties from whom these
were supposed to come.'
66
(
Pigott. 'Yes, gravely implicate.'
Russell. 'You would regard that, I suppose, as a
serious charge?'
"Pigott. 'Yes.'
Russell. Did you believe that charge to be true or
(
false?'
"Pigott. 'I believed that charge to be true.'
Russell. You believed that to be true?'
Pigott. 'I do.'
Russell. Now I will read this passage \[from Pigott's
letter to the archbishop\], “I need hardly add that, did
I consider the parties really guilty of the things charged
against them, I should not dream of suggesting that
your Grace should take part in an effort to shield them;
I only wish to impress on your Grace that the evi-
dence is apparently convincing, and would probably
be sufficient to secure conviction if submitted to
an English jury." What do you say to that, Mr.
Pigott?'
" Pigott (bewildered). I say nothing, except that I am
(
204
------
sure I could not have had the letters in my mind when I
said that, because I do not think the letters conveyed a
sufficiently serious charge to cause me to write in that
way.'
"Russell. 'But you know that was the only part of
the charge, so far as you have yet told us, that you had
anything to do in getting up?'
Pigott. 'Yes, that is what I say; I must have had
something else in my mind which I cannot at present
recollect that I must have had other charges.'
Russell. What charges?'
"Pigott.
you.'
(
I do not know. That is what I cannot tell
Russell.
Well, let me remind you that that particu-
lar part of the charges-the incriminatory letters
were letters that you yourself knew all about.'
Pigott. 'Yes, of course.'
"Russell (reading from another letter of Pigott's to
the archbishop). ""I was somewhat disappointed in not
having a line from your Grace, as I ventured to expect
I might have been so far honored. I can assure your
Grace that I have no other motive in writing save to
avert, if possible, a great danger to people with whom
your Grace is known to be in strong sympathy. At the
same time, should your Grace not desire to interfere in
the matter, or should you consider that they would refuse
me a hearing, I am well content, having acquitted myself
of what I conceived to be my duty in the circumstances.
(
------
I will not further trouble your Grace save to again beg
that you will not allow my name to transpire, seeing that
to do so would interfere injuriously with my prospects,
without any compensating advantage to any one. I
make the request all the more confidently because I have
had no part in what is being done to the prejudice of
the Parnellite party, though I was enabled to become
acquainted with all the details.

"Pigott (with a look of confusion and alarm). 'Yes.'
"Russell. What do you say to that? '
Pigott. That it appears to me clearly that I had
not the letters in my mind.'
Russell. Then if it appears to you clearly that you
had not the letters in your mind, what had you in your
mind?'
(
"Pigott. 'It must have been something far
serious.'
"Russell. What was it?'
Pigott (helplessly, great beads of perspiration stand-
ing out on his forehead and trickling down his face). 'I
cannot tell you. I have no idea.'
Russell. It must have
'It must have been something far more
serious than the letters?'
(6
(
"Pigott (vacantly). Far more serious.'
Russell (briskly). 'Can you give my Lords any clew
of the most indirect kind to what it was?'
(
Pigott (in despair). I cannot.'
"Russell. 'Or from whom you heard it?'
206
------
"Pigott. 'No.'
"Russell. 'Or when you heard it?'
Pigott. 'Or when I heard it.'
"Russell. 'Or where you heard it?'
Pigott. 'Or where I heard it.'
Russell. Have you ever mentioned this fearful mat-
ter whatever it is to anybody?'
"
(
---
Pigott. 'No.'
"Russell. Still locked up, hermetically sealed in your
own bosom?'
Pigott. No, because it has gone away out of my
bosom, whatever it was.'
(
"On receiving this answer Russell smiled, looked at
the bench, and sat down. A ripple of derisive laughter
broke over the court, and a buzz of many voices followed.
The people standing around me looked at each other
and said, 'Splendid.' The judges rose, the great crowd
melted away, and an Irishman who mingled in the
throng expressed, I think, the general sentiment in a
single word, 'Smashed.""
Pigott's cross-examination was finished the following
day, and the second day he disappeared entirely, and
later sent back from Paris a confession of his guilt,
admitting his perjury, and giving the details of how he
had forged the alleged Parnell letter by tracing words
and phrases from genuine Parnell letters, placed against
the window-pane, and admitting that he had sold the
forged letter for £605.
------
After the confession was read, the Commission "found "
that it was a forgery, and the Times withdrew the
facsimile letter.
A warrant was issued for Pigott's arrest on the charge
of perjury, but when he was tracked by the police to a
hotel in Madrid, he asked to be given time enough to
collect his belongings, and, retiring to his room, blew out
his brains.

CHAPTER XIV
THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF DR.
HARRIS CASE
IN THE CARLYLE W.
THE records of the criminal courts in this country
contain few cases that have excited so much human in-
terest among all classes of the community as the prose-
cution and conviction of Carlyle W. Harris.
Even to this day - ten years after the trial - there is
a widespread belief among men, perhaps more especially
among women, who did not attend the trial, but simply
listened to the current gossip of the day and followed
the newspaper accounts of the court proceedings, that
Harris was innocent of the crime for the commission of
which his life was forfeited to the state.
It is proposed in this chapter to discuss some of the
facts that led up to the testimony of one of the most distin-
guished toxicologists in the country, who was called for
the defence on the crucial point in the case; and to give
extracts from his cross-examination, his failure to with-
stand which was the turning-point in the entire trial.
He returned to his home in Philadelphia after he left the
witness-stand, and openly declared in public, when asked
300
------
to describe his experiences in New York, that he had
gone to New York only to make a fool of himself and
return home again."
It is also proposed to give some of the inside history
of the case
facts that never came out at the trial, not
because they were unknown at the time to the district
attorney, nor unsusceptible of proof, but because the
strict rules of evidence in such cases often, as it seems
to the writer, withhold from the ears of the jury certain
facts, the mere recital of which seems to conclude the
question of guilt. For example, the rule forbidding the
presentation to the jury of anything that was said by
the victim of a homicide, even to witnesses surrounding
the death-bed, unless the victim in express terms makes
known his own belief that he cannot live, and that he has
abandoned all hope or expectation of recovery before he
tells the tale of the manner in which he was slain, or the
causes that led up to it, has allowed many a guilty
prisoner, if not to escape entirely, at least to avoid the
full penalty for the crime he had undoubtedly committed.
Carlyle Harris was a gentleman's son, with all the
advantages of education and breeding. In his twenty-
second year, and just after graduating with honors from
the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York
City, he was indicted and tried for the murder of Miss
Helen Potts, a young, pretty, intelligent, and talented
school girl in attendance at Miss Day's Ladies' Boarding
School, on 40th Street, New York City.
310
------
Harris had made the acquaintance of Miss Potts in
the summer of 1889, and all during the winter paid
marked attention to her. The following spring, while
visiting her uncle, who was a doctor, she was delivered
of a four months' child, and was obliged to confess to
her mother that she was secretly married to Harris under
assumed names, and that her student husband had him-
self performed an abortion upon her.
Harris was sent for. He acknowledged the truth of
his wife's statements, but refused to make the marriage
public. From this time on, till the day of her daughter's
death, the wretched mother made every effort to induce
Harris to acknowledge his wife publicly. She finally
wrote him on the 20th of January, 1891, “You must go
on the 8th of February, the anniversary of your secret
marriage, before a minister of the gospel, and there have
a Christian marriage performed - no other course than
this will any longer be satisfactory to me or keep me quiet."
That very day Harris ordered at an apothecary store
six capsules, each containing 4½ grains of quinine and
of a grain of morphine, and had the box marked:
C. W. H. Student. One before retiring." Miss Potts
had been complaining of sick headaches, and Harris
gave her four of these capsules as an ostensible remedy.
He then wrote to Mrs. Potts that he would agree to her
terms "unless some other way could be found of satisfy-
ing her scruples," and went hurriedly to Old Point Com-
fort. Upon hearing from his wife that the capsules
311
------
made her worse instead of better, he still persuaded her
to continue taking them. On the day of her death she
complained to her mother about the medicine Carlyle
had given her, and threatened to throw the box with the
remaining capsule out of the window. Her mother per-
suaded her to try this last one, which she promised to do.
Miss Potts slept in a room with three classmates who,
on this particular night, had gone to a symphony concert.
Upon their return they found Helen asleep, but woke
her up and learned from her that she had been having
"such beautiful dreams," she "had been dreaming of
Carl." Then she complained of feeling numb, and
becoming frightened, begged the girls not to let her go
to sleep. She repeated that she had taken the medicine
Harris had given her, and asked them if they thought it
possible that he would give her anything to harm her.
She soon fell into a profound coma, breathing only twice
to the minute. The doctors worked over her for eleven
hours without restoring her to consciousness, when she
stopped breathing entirely.
The autopsy, fifty-six days afterward, disclosed an
apparently healthy body, and the chemical analysis of
the contents of the stomach disclosed the presence of
morphine but not of quinine, though the capsules as
originally compounded by the druggist contained twenty-
seven times as much quinine as morphine.
This astounding discovery led to the theory of the
prosecution: that Harris had emptied the contents of
312
------
one of the capsules, had substituted morphine in suffi-
cient quantities to kill, in place of the 41 grains of qui-
nine (to the eye, powdered quinine and morphine are
identical), and had placed this fatal capsule in the box
with the other three harmless ones, one to be taken each
night. He had then fled from the city, not knowing
which day would brand him a murderer.
Immediately after his wife's death Harris went to one
of his medical friends and said: "I only gave her four
capsules of the six I had made up; the two I kept out
will show that they are perfectly harmless. No jury can
convict me with those in my possession; they can be ana-
lyzed and proved to be harmless."
They were analyzed and it was proved that the pre-
scription had been correctly compounded. But often-
times the means a criminal uses in order to conceal his
deed are the very means that Providence employs to
reveal the sin that lies hidden in his soul. Harris failed
to foresee that it was the preservation of these capsules
that would really convict him. Miss Potts had taken
all that he had given her, and no one could ever have
been certain that it was not the druggist's awful mistake,
had not these retained capsules been analyzed. When
Harris emptied one capsule and reloaded it with mor-
phine, he had himself become the druggist.
It was contended that Harris never intended to recog-
nize Helen Potts as his wife. He married her in secret,
it appeared at the trial, -as it were from his own lips
212
------
-
through the medium of conversation with a friend, -
"because he could not accomplish her ruin in any
other way." He brought her to New York, was mar-
ried to her before an alderman under assumed names,
and then having accomplished his purpose, burned the
evidence of their marriage, the false certificate. Finally,
when the day was set upon which he must acknowledge
her as his wife, he planned her death.
The late recorder, Frederick Smyth, presided at the
trial with great dignity and fairness. The prisoner was
ably represented by John A. Taylor, Esq., and William
Travers Jerome, Esq., the present district attorney of
New York.
Mr. Jerome's cross-examination of Professor Witthaus,
the leading chemist for the prosecution, was an ex-
tremely able piece of work, and during its eight hours
disclosed an amount of technical information and re-
search such as is seldom seen in our courts. Had it
not been for the witness's impregnable position, he cer-
tainly would have succumbed before the attack. The
length and technicality of the examination render its use
impracticable in this connection; but it is recommended
to all students of cross-examination who find themselves
confronted with the task of examination in so remote a
branch of the advocate's equipment as a knowledge of
chemistry.
The defence consisted entirely of medical testimony,
directed toward creating a doubt as to our theory that
314
------
morphine was the cause of death. Their cross-exami-
nation of our witnesses was suggestive of death from
natural causes: from heart disease, a brain tumor, apo-
plexy, epilepsy, uremia. In fact, the multiplicity of their
defences was a great weakness. Gradually they were
forced to abandon all but two possible causes of death,
that by morphine poisoning and that by uremic poi-
soning. This narrowed the issue down to the question,
Was it a large dose of morphine that caused death, or
was it a latent kidney disease that was superinduced
and brought to light in the form of uremic coma by
small doses of morphine, such as the one-sixth of a grain
admittedly contained in the capsules Harris admin-
istered? In one case Harris was guilty; in the other
he was innocent.
Helen Potts died in a profound coma. Was it the
coma of morphine, or that of kidney disease? Many of
the leading authorities in this city had given their con-
victions in favor of the morphine theory. In reply to
those, the defence was able to call a number of young
doctors, who have since made famous names for them-
selves, but who at the time were almost useless as
witnesses with the jury because of their comparative
inexperience. Mr. Jerome had, however, secured the
services of one physician who, of all the others in the
country, had perhaps apparently best qualified himself
by his writings and thirty years of hospital experience to
speak authoritatively upon the subject.
OTE
------
His direct testimony was to the effect that - basing
his opinion partly upon wide reading of the literature of
the subject, and what seemed to him to be the general
consensus of professional opinion about it, and very
largely on his own experience "no living doctor can dis-
tinguish the coma of morphine from that of kidney dis-
ease; and as the theory of the criminal law is that, if the
death can be equally as well attributed to natural causes
as to the use of poison, the jury would be bound to give
the prisoner the benefit of the doubt and acquit him.
It was the turning-point in the trial. If any of the
jurors credited this testimony, - the witness gave the
reasons for his opinion in a very quiet, conscientious,
and impressive manner, - there certainly could be no
conviction in the case, nothing better than a disagree-
ment of the jury. It was certain Harris had given the
capsules, but unless his wife had died of morphine poi-
soning, he was innocent of her death.
The cross-examination that follows is much abbreviated
and given partly from memory. It was apparent that the
witness would withstand any amount of technical exami-
nation and easily get the better of the cross-examiner if
such matters were gone into. He had made a profound
impression. The court had listened to him with breath-
less interest. He must be dealt with gently and, if
possible, led into self-contradictions where he was least
prepared for them.
The cross-examiner sparred for an opening with the
316
------
determination to strike quickly and to sit down if he got
in one telling blow. The first one missed aim a little,
but the second brought a peal of laughter from the jury
and the audience, and the witness retired in great con-
fusion. Even the lawyers for the defence seemed to lose
heart, and although two hours before time of adjourn-
ment, begged the court for a recess till the following
day.
Counsel (quietly). "Do you wish the jury to under-
stand, doctor, that Miss Helen Potts did not die of
morphine poisoning?"
Witness. "I do not swear to that."
Counsel. What did she die of?"
Witness. "I don't swear what she died of."
Counsel. "I understood you to say that in your opin-
ion the symptoms of morphine could not be sworn to
with positiveness. Is that correct? "
Witness. "I don't think they can, with positiveness."
Counsel. "Do you wish to go out to the world as
saying that you have never diagnosed a case of morphine
poisoning excepting when you had an autopsy to exclude
kidney disease?"
Witness. " "I do not. I have not said so."
Counsel. "Then you have diagnosed a case on the
symptoms alone, yes? or no? I want a categorical
answer.
}}
Witness (sparring). "I would refuse to answer that
question categorically; the word 'diagnosed' is used
------
with two different meanings. One has to make what is
known as a ‘working diagnosis' when he is called to a
case, not a positive diagnosis."
Counsel. "When was your last case of opium or mor-
phine poisoning?"
Witness. "I can't remember which was the last."
Counsel (seeing an opening). "I don't want the name
of the patient. Give me the date approximately, that is,
the year - but under oath."
Witness. I think the last was some years ago."
How many years ago?"
Counsel.
Witness (hesitating). "It may be eight or ten years
ago."
Counsel. "Was it a case of death from morphine
poisoning?
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel. "Was there an autopsy?'
Witness. "No, sir."
Counsel. "How did you know it was a death from
morphine, if, as you said before, such symptoms cannot
be distinguished?"
66
"9
Witness. "I found out from a druggist that the woman
had taken seven grains of morphine."
Counsel. “You made no diagnosis at all until you
heard from the druggist?"
Witness. "I began to give artificial respiration."
Counsel. "But that is just what you would do in a
case of morphine poisoning?"
318
------
Witness (hesitating). "Yes, sir. I made, of course, a
working diagnosis."
Counsel. "Do you remember the case you had before
that?"
Witness. "I remember another case."
Counsel. "When was that?"
Witness. “It was a still longer time ago. I don't
know the date."
Counsel. "How many years ago, on your oath?"
Witness. " Fifteen, probably."
Counsel. “Any others?"
Witness. "Yes, one other."
Counsel. "When?"
Witness. "Twenty years ago."
Counsel. "Are these three cases all
in your experience?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel (chancing it). "Were more than one of them
deaths from morphine?"
Witness. "No, sir, only one."
Counsel (looking at the jury somewhat triumphantly).
"Then it all comes down to this: you have had the
experience of one case of morphine poisoning in the
last twenty years?"
Witness (in a low voice). "Yes, sir, one that I can
remember."
you can remember
Counsel (excitedly). "And are you willing to come
here from Philadelphia, and state that the New York
------
doctors who have already testified against you, and who
swore they had had seventy-five similar cases in their
own practice, are mistaken in their diagnoses and
conclusions?"
Witness (embarrassed and in a low tone). "Yes, sir,
I am."
"}
Counsel. "You never heard of Helen Potts until a
year after her death, did you?"
Witness. "No, sir."
Counsel. "You heard these New York physicians say
that they attended her and observed her symptoms for
eleven hours before death?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel. "Are you willing to go on record, with your
one experience in twenty years, as coming here and
saying that you do not believe our doctors can tell
morphine poisoning when they see it?"
Witness (sheepishly). "Yes, sir."
Counsel. You have stated, have you not, that the
symptoms of morphine poisoning cannot be told with
positiveness?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel. "You said you based that opinion upon
your own experience, and it now turns out you have
seen but one case in twenty years."
Witness. “I also base it upon my reading."
Counsel (becoming almost contemptuous in manner).
"Is your reading confined to your own book?
320
""
------
Witness (excitedly). "No, sir; I say no."
Counsel (calmly). "But I presume you embodied in
your own book the results of your reading, did you
not?"
Witness (a little apprehensively). “I tried to, sir.”
It must be explained here that the attending physi-
cians had said that the pupils of the eyes of Helen
Potts were contracted to a pin-point, so much so as
to be practically unrecognizable, and symmetrically
contracted that this symptom was the one invariably
present in coma from morphine poisoning, and dis-
tinguished it from all other forms of death, whereas
in the coma of kidney disease one pupil would be
dilated and the other contracted; they would be un-
symmetrical.
Counsel (continuing). "Allow me to read to you from
your own book on page 166, where you say (reading),
'I have thought that inequality of the pupils'--- that is,
where they are not symmetrically contracted is proof
that a case is not one of narcotism'. - or morphine poi-
soning 'but Professor Taylor has recorded a case of
morphine poisoning in which it \[the unsymmetrical con-
traction of the pupils\] occurred. Do I read it as you
intended it?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel.
66
So until you heard of the case that Professor
Taylor reported, you had always supposed symmetri-
cal contraction of the pupils of the eyes to be the distin-
------
guishing symptom of morphine poisoning, and it is on
this that you base your statement that the New York doc-
tors could not tell morphine poisoning positively when
they see it?"
Witness (little realizing the point). “Yes, sir."
Counsel (very loudly). “Well, sir, did you investigate
that case far enough to discover that Professor Taylor's
patient had one glass eye?"¹
Witness (in confusion). "I have no memory of it."
Counsel. "That has been proved to be the case here.
You would better go back to Philadelphia, sir.”
There were roars of laughter throughout the audience
as counsel resumed his seat and the witness walked out
of the court room. It is difficult to reproduce in print
the effect made by this occurrence, but with the retire-
ment of this witness the defendant's case suffered a
collapse from which it never recovered.
It is interesting to note that within a year of Harris's
conviction, Dr. Buchanan was indicted and tried for a
similar offence --- wife poisoning by the use of morphine.
It appeared in evidence at Dr. Buchanan's trial that,
during the Harris trial and the examination of the medi-
cal witnesses, presumably the witness whose examination
has been given above, Buchanan had said to his mess-
¹ The reports of six thousand cases of morphine poisoning had been ex-
amined by the prosecution in this case before trial, and among them the case
reported by Professor Taylor.

mates that "Harris was a
fool, he didn't know how
to mix his drugs. If he had put a little atropine with his
morphine, it would have dilated the pupil of at least one
of his victim's eyes, and no doctor could have deposed to
death by morphine."
When Buchanan's case came up for trial it was dis-
covered that, although morphine had been found in the
stomach, blood, and intestines of his wife's body, the pupils
of the eyes were not symmetrically contracted. No posi-
tive diagnosis of her case could be made by the attending
physicians until the continued chemical examination of
the contents of the body disclosed indisputable evidence
of atropine (belladonna). Buchanan had profited by the
disclosures in the Harris trial, but had made the fatal
mistake of telling his friends how it could have been
done in order to cheat science. It was this statement of
his that put the chemists on their guard, and resulted in
Buchanan's conviction and subsequent execution.
Carlyle Harris maintained his innocence even after the
Court of Appeals had unanimously sustained his convic-
tion, and even as he calmly took his seat in the electric
chair.
The most famous English poison case comparable to
the Harris and Buchanan cases was that of the celebrated
William Palmer, also a physician by profession, who poi-
soned his companion by the use of strychnine in order
to obtain his money and collect his racing bets. The
trial is referred to in detail in another chapter.
------
Palmer, like Harris and Buchanan, maintained a stoical
demeanor throughout his trial and confinement in jail,
awaiting execution. The morning of his execution he
ate his eggs at breakfast as if he were going on a journey.
When he was led to the gallows, it was demanded of him
in the name of God, as was the custom in England in
those days, if he was innocent or guilty. He made no
reply. Again the question was put, " William Palmer, in
the name of Almighty God, are you innocent or guilty?"
Just as the white cap came over his face he murmured in
a low breath, “ Guilty," and the bolts were drawn with a
crash.

CHAPTER XV
THE BELLEVUE HOSPITAL CASE
ON December 15, 1900, there appeared in the New
York World an article written by Thomas J. Minnock, a
newspaper reporter, in which he claimed to have been an
eye-witness to the shocking brutality of certain nurses in
attendance at the Insane Pavilion of Bellevue Hospital,
which resulted in the death, by strangulation, of one of
its inmates, a Frenchman named Hilliard. This French-
man had arrived at the hospital at about four o'clock in
the afternoon of Tuesday, December 11. He was suffer-
ing from alcoholic mania, but was apparently otherwise
in normal physical condition. Twenty-six hours later,
or on Wednesday, December 12, he died. An autopsy
was performed which disclosed several bruises on the
forehead, arm, hand, and shoulder, three broken ribs and
a broken hyoid bone in the neck (which supports the
tongue), and a suffusion of blood or hæmorrhage on both
sides of the windpipe. The coroner's physician reported
the cause of death, as shown by the autopsy, to be stran-
gulation. The newspaper reporter, Minnock, claimed to
have been in Bellevue at the time, feigning insanity for
newspaper purposes; and upon his discharge from the
------
hospital he stated that he had seen the Frenchman stran-
gled to death by the nurses in charge of the Pavilion by
the use of a sheet tightly twisted around the insane man's
neck. The language used in the newspaper articles writ-
ten by Minnock to describe the occurrences preceding the
Frenchman's death was as follows:-
P
"At supper time on Wednesday evening, when the
Frenchman, Mr. Hilliard, refused to eat his supper, the
nurse, Davis, started for him. Hilliard ran around
the table, and the other two nurses, Dean and Marshall,
headed him off and held him; they forced him down on
a bench, Davis called for a sheet, one of the other two,
I do not remember which, brought it, and Davis drew
it around Hilliard's neck like a rope. Dean was behind
the bench on which Hilliard had been pulled back; he
gathered up the loose ends of the sheet and pulled the
linen tight around Hilliard's neck, then he began to
twist the folds in his hand. I was horrified. I have
read of the garrote; I have seen pictures of how persons
are executed in Spanish countries; I realized that here,
before my eyes, a strangle was going to be performed.
Davis twisted the ends of the sheet in his hands, round
and round; he placed his knee against Hilliard's back
and exercised all his force. The dying man's eyes
began to bulge from their sockets; it made me sick,
but I looked on as if fascinated. Hilliard's hands
clutched frantically at the coils around his neck. 'Keep
his hands down, can't you?' shouted Davis in a rage.
------
Dean and Marshall seized the helpless man's hands;
slowly, remorselessly, Davis kept on twisting the sheet.
Hilliard began to get black in the face; his tongue was
hanging out. Marshall got frightened. Let
'Let up, he is
getting black!' he said to Davis. Davis let out a couple
of twists of the sheet, but did not seem to like to do it.
At last Hilliard got a little breath, just a little. The
sheet was still brought tight about the neck. Now
will you eat?' cried Davis. ‘No,' gasped the insane
man. Davis was furious. 'Well, I will make you eat;
I will choke you until you do eat,' he shouted, and he
began to twist the sheet again. Hilliard's head would
have fallen upon his breast but for the fact that Davis
was holding it up. He began to get black in the face
again. A second time they got frightened, and Davis
eased up on the string. He untwisted the sheet, but
still kept a firm grasp on the folds. It took Hilliard
some time to come to. When he did at last, Davis
again asked him if he would eat. Hilliard had just
breath enough to whisper faintly, 'No.' I thought the
man was dying then. Davis twisted up the sheet again,
and cried, 'Well, I will make him eat or I will choke
him to death.' He twisted and twisted until I thought
he would break the man's neck. Hilliard was uncon-
scious at last. Davis jerked the man to the floor and
kneeled on him, but still had the strangle hold with his
knee giving him additional purchase. He twisted the
sheet until his own fingers were sore, then the three
327
(
------
nurses dragged the limp body to the bath-room, heaved
him into the tub with his clothes on, and turned the
cold water on him. He was dead by this time, I believe.
He was strangled to death, and the finishing touches
were put on when they had him on the floor. No big,
strong, healthy man could have lived under that awful
strangling. Hilliard was weak and feeble.”
The above article appeared in the morning Journal,
a few days after the original publication in the New
York World. The other local papers immediately took
up the story, and it is easy to imagine the pitch to which
the public excitement and indignation were aroused. The
three nurses in charge of the pavilion at the time of Hil-
liard's death were immediately indicted for manslaughter,
and the head nurse, Jesse R. Davis, was promptly put on
trial in the Court of General Sessions, before Mr. Justice
Cowing and a "special jury." The trial lasted three
weeks, and after deliberating five hours upon their ver-
dict, the jury acquitted the prisoner.
The intense interest taken in the case, not only by the
public, but by the medical profession, was increased by
the fact that for the first time in the criminal courts of
this country two inmates of the insane pavilion, them-
selves admittedly insane, were called by the prosecution,
and sworn and accepted by the court as witnesses against
the prisoner. One of these witnesses was suffering from
a form of insanity known as paranoia, and the other from
general paresis. With the exception of the two insane
328
------
witnesses and the medical testimony founded upon the
autopsy, there was no direct evidence on which to con-
vict the prisoner but the statement of the newspaper
reporter, Minnock. He was the one sane witness called
on behalf of the prosecution, who was an eye-witness to
the occurrence, and the issues in the case gradually nar-
rowed down to a question of veracity between the news-
paper reporter and the accused prisoner, the testimony
of each of these witnesses being corroborated or
contradicted on one side or the other by various other
witnesses.
If Minnock's testimony was credited by the jury, the
prisoner's contradiction would naturally have no effect
whatever, and the public prejudice, indignation, and
excitement ran so high that the jury were only too ready
and willing to accept the newspaper account of the trans-
action. The cross-examination of Minnock, therefore,
became of the utmost importance. It was essential that
the effect of his testimony should be broken, and counsel
having his cross-examination in charge had made the
most elaborate preparations for the task. Extracts from
the cross-examination are here given as illustrations of
many of the suggestions which have been discussed in
previous chapters.
The district attorney in charge of the prosecution was
Franklin Pierce, Esq. In his opening address to the
jury he stated that he “did not believe that ever in the
history of the state, or indeed of the country, had a jury
320
------
been called upon to decide such an important case as the
66
one on trial." He continued: “ There is no fiction
no
Hard Cash' in this case. The facts here surpass any-
thing that fiction has ever produced. The witnesses will
describe the most terrible treatment that was ever given
to an insane man. No writer of fiction could have put
them in a book. They would appear so improbable and
monstrous that his manuscript would have been rejected
as soon as offered to a publisher."
When the reporter, Minnock, stepped to the witness-
stand, the court room was crowded, and yet so intense
was the excitement that every word the witness uttered
could be distinctly heard by everybody present. He
gave his evidence in chief clearly and calmly, and with
no apparent motive but to narrate correctly the details of
the crime he had seen committed. Any one unaware
of his career would have regarded him as an unusually
clever and apparently honest and courageous man with a
keen memory and with just the slightest touch of gratifi-
cation at the important position he was holding in the
public eye in consequence of his having unearthed the
atrocities perpetrated in our public hospitals.
His direct evidence was practically a repetition of his
newspaper article already referred to, only much more in
detail. After questioning him for about an hour, the
district attorney sat down with a confident "He is your
witness, if you wish to cross-examine him."
No one who has never experienced it can have the
6
330
------
slightest appreciation of the nervous excitement attendant
on being called upon to cross-examine the chief witness
in a case involving the life or liberty of a human being.
If Minnock withstood the cross-examination, the nurse
Davis, apparently a most worthy and refined young man
who had just graduated from the Mills Training School
for Nurses, and about to be married to a most estimable
young lady, would have to spend at least the next twenty
years of his life at hard labor in state prison.
The first fifteen minutes of the cross-examination were
devoted to showing that the witness was a thoroughly
educated man, twenty-five years of age, a graduate of
Saint John's College, Fordham, New York, the Sacred
Heart Academy, the Francis Xavier, the De Lasalle In-
stitution, and had travelled extensively in Europe and
America. The cross-examination then proceeded:
Counsel (amiably). "Mr. Minnock, I believe you have
written the story of your life and published it in the
Bridgeport Sunday Herald as recently as last December?
I hold the original article in my hand."
Witness. "It was not the story of my life."
Counsel. The article is signed by you and purports
to be a history of your life."
Witness. "It is an imaginary story dealing with hyp-
notism. Fiction partly, but it dealt with facts."
Counsel. "That is, you mean to say you mixed fiction
and fact in the history of your life?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
2.
-
------
Counsel. "In other words, you dressed up facts with
fiction to make them more interesting?"
Witness. "Precisely."
Counsel.
When in this article you wrote that at the
age of twelve you ran away with a circus, was that dressed
up?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel. "It was not true?"
Witness. "No, sir."
Counsel. When you said that you continued with
this circus for over a year, and went with it to Belgium,
there was a particle of truth in that because you did, as
a matter of fact, go to Belgium, but not with the circus
as a public clown; is that the idea?
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel. "So there was some little truth mixed in at
this point with the other matter?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel. 'When you wrote that you were introduced
in Belgium, at the Hospital General, to Charcot, the cele-
brated Parisian hypnotist, was there some truth in that?"
Witness. No, sir."
Counsel. "You knew that Charcot was one of the
originators of hypnotism in France, didn't you?"
Witness. "I knew that he was one of the original
hypnotists."
Counsel. "How did you come to state in the news-
paper history of your life that you were introduced to
332
------
Charcot at the Hospital General at Paris if that was not
true?
}}
Witness. While there I met a Charcot."
Counsel. "Oh, I see."
Witness. "But not the original Charcot."
Counsel. "Which Charcot did you meet?"
Witness. A woman. She was a lady assuming the
name of Charcot, claiming to be Madame Charcot."
Counsel. "So that when you wrote in this article that
you had met Charcot, you intended people to understand
that it was the celebrated Professor Charcot, and it was
partly true, because there was a woman by the name of
Charcot whom you had really met?"
Witness. "Precisely."
Counsel (quietly). "That is to say, there was some
truth in it?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel. "When in that article you said that Charcot
taught you to stand pain, was there any truth in that?"
Witness. "No."
Counsel. "Did you as a matter of fact learn to stand
pain?"
Witness. "No."
Counsel. "When you said in this article that Charcot
began by sticking pins and knives into you little by
little, so as to accustom you to standing pain, was that
all fiction?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
------
Counsel. "When you wrote that Charcot taught you
to reduce your respirations to two a minute, so as to
make your body insensible to pain, was that fiction?"
Witness. "Purely imagination."
Court (interrupting). Counsellor, I will not allow
you to go further in this line of inquiry. The witness
himself says his article was almost entirely fiction, some
of it founded upon fact. I will allow you the greatest
latitude in a proper way, but not in this direction."
Counsel. "Your Honor does not catch the point."
Court. "I do not think I do."
Counsel. This prosecution was started by a news-
paper article written by the witness, and published in
the morning Journal. It is the claim of the defence
that the newspaper article was a mixture of fact and fic-
tion, mostly fiction. The witness has already admitted
that the history of his life, published but a few months
ago, and written and signed by himself and sold as a his-
tory of his life, was a mixture of fact and fiction, mostly
fiction. Would it not be instructive to the jury to learn
from the lips of the witness himself how far he dressed
up the pretended history of his own life, that they may
draw from it some inference as to how far he has like-
wise dressed up the article which was the origin of this
prosecution?"
Court. "I shall grant you the greatest latitude in ex-
amination of the witness in regard to the newspaper
article which he published in regard to this case, but I
334
------
exclude all questions relating to the witness's newspaper
history of his own life."
Counsel. "Did you not have yourself photographed
and published in the newspapers in connection with the
history of your life, with your mouth and lips and ears
sewed up, while you were insensible to pain?"
Court. Question excluded."
Counsel. Did you not publish a picture of yourself
in connection with the pretended history of your life,
representing yourself upon a cross, spiked hand and foot,
but insensible to pain, in consequence of the instruction.
you had received from Professor Charcot?"
Court. "Question excluded."
66
Counsel. "I offer these pictures and articles in evi-
dence."
Court (roughly). “Excluded.”
Counsel. In the article you published in the New
York Journal, wherein you described the occurrences in
the present case, which you have just now related upon
the witness-stand, did you there have yourself represented
as in the position of the insane patient, with a sheet
twisted around your neck, and held by the hands of the
hospital nurse who was strangling you to death?"
Witness. "I wrote the article, but I did not pose for
the picture. The picture was posed for by some one else
who looked like me."
Counsel (stepping up to the witness and handing him
the newspaper article). "Are not these words under
------
your picture, 'This is how I saw it done, Thomas J.
Minnock,' a facsimile of your handwriting?"
Witness. "Yes, sir, it is my handwriting."
Counsel. "Referring to the history of your life again
how many imaginary articles on the subject have you
written for the newspapers throughout the country?"
Witness. " One."
Counsel. "You have put several articles in New York
papers, have you not?"
Witness. "It was only the original story. It has since
been redressed, that's all."
Counsel. "Each time you signed the article and sold
it to the newspaper for money, did you not?"
Court. " Excluded."
Counsel (with a sudden change of manner, and in a
loud voice, turning to the audience). "Is the chief of
police of Bridgeport, Connecticut, in the court room?
(Turning to the witness.) Mr. Minnock, do you know
this gentleman?"
Witness. "I do."
Counsel. "Tell the jury when you first made his
acquaintance."
Witness. "It was when I was arrested in the At-
lantic Hotel, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, with my
wife."
Counsel. “Was she your wife at the time?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel. "She was but sixteen
years old?"
336
------
Witness. "Seventeen, I guess."
Counsel. "You were arrested on the ground that you
were trying to drug this sixteen-year-old girl and kidnap
her to New York. Do you deny it?'
""
Witness (doggedly). "I was arrested."
Counsel (sharply). "You know the cause of the arrest
to be as I have stated? Answer yes or no!"
Witness (hesitating). "Yes, sir."
Counsel. "You were permitted by the prosecuting
attorney, F. A. Bartlett, to be discharged without
trial on your promise to leave the state, were you
not?"
Witness. “I don't remember anything of that."
Counsel. Do you deny it?"
Witness. "I do."
Counsel. Did you
upon that occasion ?"
have another young man with you
Witness. "I did. A college chum."
Counsel. "Was he also married to this sixteen-year-
old girl?"
Witness (no answer).
Counsel (pointedly at witness). "Was he married to
this girl also?
Witness. "Why, no."
Counsel. “You say you were married to her. Give
me the date of your marriage."
Witness (hesitating). "I don't remember the date."
Counsel. "How many years ago was it?'
------
Witness. "I don't remember."
Counsel. "How many years ago was it?”
Witness. "I couldn't say."
Counsel. "What is your best memory as to how many
years ago it was?"
Witness. "I can't recollect."
Counsel. "Try to recollect about when you were
married."
Witness. “I was married twice, civil marriage and
church marriage."
Counsel. "I am talking about Miss Sadie Cook.
When were you married to Sadie Cook, and where is
the marriage recorded?"
Witness. "I tell you I don't remember."
Counsel. "Try."
Witness.
It might be five or six or seven or ten
years ago."
Counsel. "Then you cannot tell within five years of
the time when you were married, and you are now only
twenty-five years old?"
Witness. "I cannot."
Counsel. "Were you married at fifteen years of age?"
Witness. "I don't think I was."
Counsel. "You know, do you not, that your marriage
was several years after this arrest in Bridgeport that I
have been speaking to you about?"
Witness. “I know nothing of the kind."
Counsel (resolutely). "Do you deny it?"
338
------
Witness (hesitating). “Well, no, I do not deny it.'
Counsel. "I hand you now what purports to be the
certificate of your marriage, three years ago. Is the date
correct? "
Witness. “I never saw it before."
Counsel. Does the certificate correctly state the time
and place and circumstances of your marriage?"
Witness. "I refuse to answer the question on the
ground that it would incriminate my wife."
The theory on which the defence was being made
was that the witness, Minnock, had manufactured the
story which he had printed in the paper, and later swore
to before the grand jury and at the trial. The effort in
his cross-examination was to show that he was the kind
of man who would manufacture such a story and sell it
to the newspapers, and afterward, when compelled to do
so, swear to it in court.
Counsel next called the witness's attention to many
facts tending to show that he had been an eye-witness
to adultery in divorce cases, and on both sides of them,
first on one side, then on the other, in the same case,
and that he had been at one time a private detective.
Men whom he had robbed and blackmailed and cheated
at cards were called from the audience, one after another,
and he was confronted with questions referring to these
charges, all of which he denied in the presence of his
accusers. The presiding judge having stated to the
counsel in the hearing of the witness that although he
------
allowed the witness to be brought face to face with his
alleged accusers, yet he would allow no contradictions
of the witness on these collateral matters. Minnock's
former defiant demeanor immediately returned.
The next interrogatories put to the witness developed
the fact that, feigning insanity, he had allowed himself
to be taken to Bellevue with the hope of being trans-
ferred to Ward's Island, with the intention of finally
being discharged as cured, and then writing sensational
newspaper articles regarding what he had seen while an
inmate of the public insane asylums; that in Bellevue
Hospital he had been detected as a malingerer by one
of the attending physicians, Dr. Fitch, and had been
taken before a police magistrate where he had stated in
open court that he had found everything in Bellevue
"far better than he had expected to find it,” and that he
had “no complaint to make and nothing to criticise."
The witness's mind was then taken from the main sub-
ject by questions concerning the various conversations
had with the different nurses while in the asylum, all
of which conversations he denied. The interrogatories
were put in such a way as to admit of a "yes" or "no"
answer only. Gradually coming nearer to the point
desired to be made, the following questions were asked:
Counsel. Did the nurse Gordon ask you why you
were willing to submit to confinement as an insane
patient, and did you reply that you were a newspaper
man and under contract with a Sunday paper to write
---
------
up
the methods of the asylum, but that the paper had
repudiated the contract?"
Witness. "No."
Counsel. "Or words to that effect?"
Witness. "No.”
Counsel. "I am referring to a time subsequent to
your discharge from the asylum, and after you had
returned to take away your belongings. Did you, at
that time, tell the nurse Gordon that you had expected to
be able to write an article for which you could get $140?"
Witness. "I did not."
Counsel. "Did the nurse say to you, 'You got fooled
this time, didn't you?' And did you reply, 'Yes, but I
will try to write up something and see if I can't get
square with them!""
Witness. “I have no memory of it."
Counsel. "Or words to that effect?"
Witness. "I did not."
All that preceded had served only as a veiled introduc-
tion to the next important question.
Counsel (quietly). “At that time, as a matter of fact,
did you know anything you could write about when you
got back to the Herald office?"
Witness. "I knew there was nothing to write."
Counsel. "Did you know at that time, or have any
idea, what you would write when you got out?"
Witness. Did I at that time know? Why, I knew
there was nothing to write."
------
Counsel (walking forward and pointing excitedly at the
witness). “Although you had seen a man choked to
death with a sheet on Wednesday night, you knew on
Friday morning that there was nothing you could write
about?"
Witness (hesitating). “I didn't know they had killed
the man."
Counsel. "Although you had seen the patient fall un-
conscious several times to the floor after having been
choked with the sheet twisted around his neck,
you knew
there was nothing to write about?'
Witness. "I knew it was my duty to go and see the
charity commissioner and tell him about that."
Counsel. "But you were a newspaper reporter in the
asylum, for the purpose of writing up an article. Do
you want to take back what you said a moment ago -
that you knew there was nothing to write about?"
-
Witness. "Certainly not. I did not know the man
was dead."
Counsel. "Did you not testify that the morning after
you had seen the patient choked into unconsciousness,
you heard the nurse call up the morgue to inquire if
the autopsy had been made?"
Witness (sheepishly.) "Well, the story that I had the
contract for with the Herald was cancelled."
Counsel. Is it not a fact that within four hours of the
time you were finally discharged from the hospital on
Saturday afternoon, you read the newspaper account of
342
------
the autopsy, and then immediately wrote your story of
having seen this patient strangled to death and offered
it for sale to the New York World?
Witness. “That is right; yes, sir."
Counsel. "You say you knew it was your duty to go
to the charity commissioner and tell him what you had
seen. Did you go to him?"
Witness. "No, not after I found out through reading
the autopsy that the man was killed."
Counsel. "Instead, you went to the World, and offered
them the story in which you describe the way Hilliard
was killed?"
Witness. "Yes."
Counsel. "And you did this within three or four hours
of the time you read the newspaper account of the
autopsy? "
Witness.
"Yes.”
Counsel. The editors of the World refused your
story unless you would put it in the form of an affidavit,
did they not?”
Witness. "Yes.”
Counsel. "Did you put it in the form of an affidavit?"
Witness. "Yes."
Counsel. "And that was the very night that you were
discharged from the hospital?”
Witness. Yes."
Counsel. "Every occurrence was then fresh in your
mind, was it not?"
212
------
Witness (hesitating). "What?'
Counsel. "Were the occurrences of the hospital fresh
in your mind at the time?"
Witness. "Well, not any fresher then than they are
now."
Counsel. "As fresh as now?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel (pausing, looking among his papers, selecting
one and walking up to the witness, handing it to him).
“Take this affidavit, made that Friday night, and sold
to the World; show me where there is a word in it
about Davis having strangled the Frenchman with a
sheet, the way you have described it here to-day to this
jury."
Witness (refusing paper). "No, I don't think that it is
there. It is not necessary for me to look it over."
Counsel (shouting). "Don't think! You know that
it is not there, do you not?"
Witness (nervously). "Yes, sir; it is not there."
Counsel. Had you forgotten it when you made that
affidavit?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel (loudly). "You had forgotten it, although only
three days before you had seen a man strangled in your
presence, with a sheet twisted around his throat, and
had seen him fall lifeless upon the floor; you had forgot-
ten it when you described the incident and made the
affidavit about it to the World?
344
>>
------
Witness (hesitating). "I made two affidavits. I be
lieve that is in the second affidavit."
Counsel. " Answer my questions, Mr. Minnock. Is
there any doubt that you had forgotten it when you
made the first affidavit to the World?
Witness. "I had forgotten it."
Counsel (abruptly). "When did you recollect?"
Witness. "I recollected it when I made the second
affidavit before the coroner."
Counsel. "And when did you make that?"
Witness. "It was a few days afterward, probably the
next day or two."
Counsel (looking among his papers, and again walking
up to the witness). "Please take the coroner's affidavit
and point out to the jury where there is a word about
a sheet having been used to strangle this man."
Witness (refusing paper). "Well, it may not be there."
Counsel. Is it there?"
Witness (still refusing paper). "I don't know."
Counsel. "Read it, read it carefully."
Witness (reading). "I don't see anything about it.”
Counsel. Had you forgotten it at that time as well?"
Witness (in confusion). "I certainly must have."
Counsel. "Do you want this jury to believe that, hav-
ing witnessed this horrible scene which you have de-
scribed, you immediately forgot it, and on two different
occasions when you were narrating under oath what
took place in that hospital, you forgot to mention it?"
215
------
Witness. "It escaped my memory."
Counsel. "You have testified as a witness before in
this case, have you not?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel. Before the coroner?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel. "But this sheet incident escaped your
memory then?"
Witness. "It did not."
Counsel (taking in his hands the stenographer's min-
utes of the coroner's inquest). Do you not recollect
that you testified for two hours before the coroner with-
out mentioning the sheet incident, and were then ex-
cused and were absent from the court for several days
before you returned and gave the details of the sheet
incident?"
Witness. "Yes, sir; that is correct."
Counsel. "Why did you not give an account of the
sheet incident on the first day of your testimony?"
Witness. "Well, it escaped my memory; I forgot
it."
Counsel. "Do you recollect, before beginning your
testimony before the coroner, you asked to look at the
affidavit that you had made for the World?"
Witness. Yes, I had been sick, and I wanted to
refresh my memory."
Counsel. "Do you mean that this scene that you
have described so glibly to-day had faded out of your
346
------
mind then, and you wanted your affidavit to refresh
your recollection?"
Witness. "No, it had not faded. I merely wanted to
refresh my recollection."
Counsel. " Was it not rather that you had made up
the story in your affidavit, and you wanted the affidavit
to refresh your recollection as to the story you had
manufactured?"
Witness. "No, sir; that is not true."
The purpose of these questions, and the use made of
the answers upon the argument, is shown by the follow-
ing extract from the summing up :-
"My point is this, gentlemen of the jury, and it is
an unanswerable one in my judgment, Mr. District At-
torney: If Minnock, fresh from the asylum, forgot this
sheet incident when he went to sell his first newspaper
article to the World; if he also forgot it when he went
to the coroner two days afterward to make his second
affidavit; if he still forgot it two weeks later when, at
the inquest, he testified for two hours, without mention-
ing it, and only first recollected it when he was recalled
two days afterward, then there is but one inference to
be drawn, and that is, that he never saw it, because he
could not forget it if he had ever seen it! And the
important feature is this: he was a newspaper reporter;
he was there, as the district attorney says, 'to observe
what was going on.’ He says that he stood by in that
part of the room, pretending to take away the dishes in
217
------
order to see what was going on. He was sane, the
only sane man there. Now if he did not see it, it is
because it did not take place, and if it did not take place,
the insane men called here as witnesses could not have
seen it. Do you see the point? Can you answer it?
Let me put it again. It is not in mortal mind to believe
that this man could have seen such a transaction as he
describes and ever have forgotten it. Forget it when he
writes his article the night he leaves the asylum and
sells it to the morning World ! Forget it two days
afterward when he makes a second important affidavit!
He makes still another statement, and does not mention
it, and even testifies at the coroner's inquest two weeks
later, and leaves it out. Can the human mind draw any
other inference from these facts than that he never saw
it because he could not have forgotten it if he had
ever seen it? If he never saw it, it did not take place.
He was on the spot, sane, and watching everything
that went on, for the very purpose of reporting it. Now
if this sheet incident did not take place, the insane men
could not have seen it. This disposes not only of
Minnock, but of all the testimony in the People's case.
In order to say by your verdict that that sheet incident
took place, you have got to find something that is con-
trary to all human experience; that is, that this man,
Minnock, having seen the horrible strangling with the
sheet, as he described, could possibly have immediately
forgotten it."
348
------
The contents of the two affidavits made to the
World and the coroner were next taken up, and the
witness was first asked what the occurrence really was
as he now remembered it. After his answers, his
attention was called to what he said in his affidavits, and
upon the differences being made apparent, he was asked
whether what he then swore to, or what he now swore
to, was the actual fact; and if he was now testifying from
what he remembered to have seen, or if he was trying to
remember the facts as he made them up in the affidavit.
Counsel. "What was the condition of the Frenchman
at supper time? Was he as gay and chipper as when
you said that he had warmed up after he had been walk-
ing around awhile?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel. "But in your affidavit you state that he
seemed to be very feeble at supper. Is that true?"
Witness. "Well, yes; he did seem to be feeble."
Counsel. But you said a moment ago that he warmed
up and was all right at supper time."
"Oh, you just led me into that."
Well, I won't lead you into anything more.
Tell us how he walked to the table.”
Witness.
Counsel.
Witness. "Well, slowly."
Counsel. "Do you remember what you said in the
affidavit?"
Witness. “I certainly do."
Counsel. "What did you say?"
------
Witness. "I said he walked in a feeble condition."
Counsel. Are you sure that you said anything in the
affidavit about how he walked at all?"
Witness. "I am not sure."
Counsel. "The sheet incident, which you have de-
scribed so graphically, occurred at what hour on Wednes-
day afternoon?"
Witness. “About six o'clock.”
Counsel. "
"Previous to that time, during the afternoon,
had there been any violence shown toward him?"
Witness. " Yes; he was shoved down several times by
the nurses."
Counsel. "You mean they let him fall?
Witness. "Yes, they thought it a very funny thing to
let him totter backward, and to fall down. They then
picked him up. His knees seemed to be kind of muscle-
bound, and he tottered back and fell, and they laughed.
This was somewhere around three o'clock in the after-
noon."
Counsel. "How many times, Mr. Minnock, would you
swear that you saw him fall over backward, and after
being picked up by the nurse, let fall again?"
Witness. "Four or five times during the afternoon."
Counsel. "And would he always fall backward?"
Witness. "Yes, sir; he repeated the operation of tot-
tering backward. He would totter about five feet, and
would lose his balance and would fall over backward."
The witness was led on to describe in detail this pro-
350
------
cess of holding up the patient, and allowing him to
fall backward, and then picking him up again, in order
to make the contrast more apparent with what he had
said on previous occasions and had evidently forgotten.
Counsel. "I now read to you from the stenographer's
minutes what you said on this subject in your sworn
testimony given at the coroner's inquest. You were
asked, 'Was there any violence inflicted on Wednesday
before dinner time?' And you answered, ‘I didn't see
any.' You were then asked if, up to dinner time at six
o'clock on Wednesday night, there had been any violence;
and you answered: 'No, sir; no violence since Tuesday
night. There was nothing happened until Wednesday
at supper time, somewhere about six o'clock.' Now what
have you to say as to these different statements, both
given under oath, one given at the coroner's inquest, and
the other given here to-day?
})
Witness. "Well, what I said about violence may have
been omitted by the coroner's stenographer."
Counsel. "But did you swear to the answers that I
have just read to you before the coroner?"
Witness. "I
"I may have, and I may not have. I don't
know."
Counsel. "If you swore before the coroner there was
no violence, and nothing happened until Wednesday
after supper, did you mean to say it?"
Witness. "I don't remember.”
Counsel. "After hearing read what you swore to at
T
------
the coroner's inquest, do you still maintain the truth of
what you have sworn to at this trial, as to seeing the nurse
let the patient fall backward four or five times, and pick
him up and laugh at him?"
Witness. “I certainly do."
Counsel. "I again read you from the coroner's min-
utes a question asked you by the coroner himself.
Question by the coroner, 'Did you at any time while in
the office or the large room of the asylum see Hilliard
fall or stumble?' Answer, 'No, sir; I never did.' What
have you to say to that?"
Witness. That is correct."
Counsel. "Then what becomes of your statement
made to the jury but fifteen minutes ago, that you saw
him totter and fall backward several times?"
Witness. "It was brought out later on before the
coroner."
Counsel. "Brought out later on! Let me read to
you the next question put to you before the coroner.
Question, 'Did you at any time see him try to walk
or run away and fall?' Answer, No, I never saw him
fall.' What have you to say to that?"
Witness. Well, I must have put in about the tot-
tering in my affidavit, and omitted it later before the
coroner."
(
At the beginning of the cross-examination it had been
necessary for the counsel to fight with the Court over
nearly every question asked; and question after question
352
------
was ruled out. As the examination proceeded, however,
the Court began to change its attitude entirely toward
the witness. The presiding judge constantly frowned
on the witness, kept his eyes riveted upon him, and finally
broke out at this juncture: "Let me caution you, Mr
Minnock, once for all, you are here to answer counsel's
questions. If you can't answer them, say so; and if you
can answer them, do so; and if you have no recollection,
say so."
""
has been
Witness. "Well, your Honor, Mr.
cross-examining me very severely about my wife, which
he has no right to do."
Court. "You have no right to bring that up. He has
a perfect right to cross-examine you."
Witness (losing his temper completely). "That man
wouldn't dare to ask me those questions outside. He
knows that he is under the protection of the court, or
I would break his neck."
Court. "You are making a poor exhibit of yourself.
Answer the questions, sir."
Counsel. "You don't seem to have any memory at all
about this transaction. Are you testifying from memory
as to what you saw, or making up as you go along?
>>
Witness (no answer).
Counsel. Which is it?"
Witness (doggedly). "I am telling what I saw."
Counsel. "Well, listen to this then. You said in your
affidavit: The blood was all over the floor. It was covered
(
------
with Hilliard's blood, and the scrub woman came Tues-
day and Wednesday morning, and washed the blood away.'
Is that right?"
Witness. "Yes, sir."
Counsel. "Why, I understood you to say that you
didn't get up Wednesday morning until noon. How
could you see the scrub woman wash the blood
away?"
Witness. "They were at the farther end of the hall.
They washed the whole pavilion. I didn't see them
Wednesday morning; it was Tuesday morning I saw
them scrubbing."
Counsel. "You seem to have forgotten that Hilliard,
the deceased, did not arrive at the pavilion until Tuesday
afternoon at four o'clock. What have you to say to
that?"
Witness. "Well, there were other people who got beat-
ings besides him."
Counsel. Then that is what you meant to refer to in
your affidavit, when speaking of Hilliard's blood upon the
floor. You meant beatings of other people?"
Witness. "Yes sir. -on Tuesday."
The witness was then forced to testify to minor details,
which, within the knowledge of the defence, could be con-
tradicted by a dozen disinterested witnesses. Such, for
instance, as hearing the nurse Davis call up the morgue,
the morning after Hilliard was killed, at least a dozen
times on the telephone, and anxiously inquire what had
354
------
been disclosed by the autopsy; whereas, in fact, there was
no direct telephonic communication whatever between
the morgue and the insane pavilion; and the morgue
attendants were prepared to swear that no one had called
them up concerning the Hilliard autopsy, and that there
were no inquiries from any source. The witness was next
made to testify affirmatively to minor facts that could be,
and were afterward, contradicted by Dr. Wildman, by Dr.
Moore, by Dr. Fitch, by Justice Hogman, by night nurses
Clancy and Gordon, by Mr. Dwyer, Mr. Hayes, Mr. Fayne,
by Gleason the registrar, by Spencer the electrician, by
Jackson the janitor, and by several of the state's own
witnesses who were to be called later.
By this time the witness had begun to flounder help-
lessly. He contradicted himself constantly, became red
and pale by turns, hesitated before each answer, at times
corrected his answers, at others was silent and made no
answer at all. At the expiration of four hours he left
the witness-stand a thoroughly discredited, haggard, and
wretched object. The court ordered him to return the
following day, but he never was seen again at the
trial.
A week later, his foster-mother, when called to the wit-
ness-chair by the defence, handed to the judge a letter
received that morning from her son, who was in Phila-
delphia (which, however, was not allowed to be shown to
the jury) in which he wrote that he had shaken from
his feet the dust of New York forever, and would never
------
return; that he felt he had been ruined, and would be
arrested for perjury if he came back, and requested money
that he might travel far into the West and commence
life anew.
It was altogether the most tragic incident
in the experience of the writer.

CHAPTER XVI
THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF GUITEAU, THE ASSASSIN OF
PRESIDENT GARFIELD, BY MR. JOHN K. PORTER
THE trial of Charles J. Guiteau for the assassination
of President Garfield was in many respects one of the
most remarkable trials in the history of our American
courts. Guiteau's claim was that he shot the President
acting upon what he believed to be an inspiration, - a
divine command, which controlled his conscience,
overpowered his will, and which it was impossible for
him to resist. Guiteau openly avowed the act of kill-
ing, but imputed the blame to the Almighty. The
defence, therefore, was moral insanity.
The trial was conducted in the June term of the
Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, in the year
1881. It lasted two months. The court room was
daily filled with the scum of Washington, negroes,
prostitutes, and curiosity seekers of all kinds. On
account of the crowds, the doors of the court were kept
shut, and many of the expert physicians became ill in
consequence of the excessively foul air. One doctor
died from the effects of the long infection.
The prisoner, although represented by counsel, was
------
permitted to address the jury in his own behalf. He
was also allowed to interrupt the proceedings practically
at will. Each day's session was opened with a tirade
from the prisoner, in which he heaped upon the counsel
representing the Government, abuse, calumny, and
vituperation unequalled in the proceedings of any court
of justice in the history of the country. The evidence
of the different witnesses was given amid clamor, objec-
tions, interruptions, and blasphemy upon the part of the
prisoner.
Guiteau's attitude in court and in the jail prior to the
trial were very different. In the latter, while being
examined by the experts, all his replies were intelligent
and he talked freely upon every subject but the murder,
concerning which his set reply was, " I beg your pardon,
gentlemen, but you will have to excuse me from talking
about a subject which involves my legal rights."
Only eighty copies of the Record of the Guiteau
Trial were preserved by the Government for distribu-
tion. Every capital in Europe applied for a copy, only
to be told that there were not any supplied by the Gov-
ernment for general distribution. A resolution in
Congress providing for the printing of a large number
of copies was opposed and defeated in the Senate by
Senator Sherman, upon the ground that he did not
believe in perpetuating the history of Guiteau's act in
documentary form.
The cross-examination of Guiteau by Mr. John K.
------
Porter is often spoken of as one of the great master-
pieces of forensic skill. It would be impracticable to
give more than a few extracts from the examination.
The record of the trial covers over twenty-five hundred
closely printed pages in Government print, equal to
about five thousand pages of ordinary print. All
together, the report of the trial constitutes probably the
most complete contribution on the subject of the legal
responsibility of persons having diseased minds or
insane habits.
Mr. Porter's cross-examination showed Guiteau to be
a beggar, a hypocrite, a swindler; cunning and crafty,
remorseless, utterly selfish from his youth up, low and
brutal in his instincts, inordinate in his love of noto-
riety, eaten up by a love of money; a lawyer who, after
many years of practice in two large cities, had never
won a case; a man who left in every state through
which he passed a trail of knavery, fraud, and imposi-
tion. His cross-examination made apparent to every-
body that Guiteau's vanity was inordinate, his spirit
of selfishness, jealousy, and hatred absolutely unbounded.
He was cleverly led to picture himself to the civilized
world as a moral monstrosity.
Mr. Porter. "Did you say, as Mr. John R. Scott
swears, on leaving the depot on the day of the murder
of the President, 'General Arthur is now the President
of the United States'?"
Guiteau. "I decline to say whether I did or not.'
359
------
Mr. Porter. You thought so, did you not? You
are a man of truth?"
Guiteau. "I think I made a statement to that effect."
Mr. Porter. "You thought you had killed President
Garfield?"
Guiteau. "I supposed so at the time."
Mr. Porter. "You intended to kill him?"
Guiteau. I thought the Deity and I had done it, sir."
Mr. Porter. Who bought the pistol, the Deity or
you?"
Guiteau (excitedly). “I say the Deity inspired the act,
and the Deity will take care of it."
Mr. Porter. "Who bought the pistol, the Deity or
you?"
Guitcau. "The Deity furnished the money by which
I bought it, as the agent of the Deity."
Mr. Porter. “I thought it was somebody else who
furnished the money?
>>
Guitcau. "I say the Deity furnished the money."
Mr. Porter. "Did Mr. Maynard lend you the money?"
Guiteau. "He loaned me $15,--- yes, sir; and I used
$10 of it to buy the pistol."
Mr. Porter. "Were you inspired to borrow the $15
of Mr. Maynard?"
Guiteau. "It was of no consequence whether I got
it from him or somebody else."
Mr. Porter. Were you inspired to buy that British
bull-dog pistol?"
360
------
Guiteau. I had to use my ordinary judgment as to
ways and means to accomplish the Deity's will."
Mr. Porter. Were you inspired to
to remove the
President by murder?"
Guiteau. "I was inspired to execute the divine will."
Mr. Porter. "By murder?"
Guiteau. "Yes, sir, so-called murder."
Mr. Porter. " "You intended to do it?"
Guiteau. "I intended to execute the divine will, sir."
Mr. Porter. You did not succeed?"
Guiteau. "I think the doctors did the work."
Mr. Porter. “The Deity tried, and you tried, and
both failed, but the doctors succeeded?"
Guiteau. The Deity confirmed my act by letting the
President down as gently as He did.”
Mr. Porter. "Do you think that it was letting him
down gently to allow him to suffer with torture, over
which you professed to feel so much solicitude, during
those long months?”
Guiteau. The whole matter was in the hands of the
Deity. I do not wish to discuss it any further."
Mr. Porter. "Did you believe it was the will of God
that you should murder him?"
Guiteau. "I believe that it was the will of God that
he should be removed, and that I was the appointed
agent to do it."
Mr. Porter. “Did He give you the commission in
writing?"
361
------
Guiteau. "No, sir."
Mr. Porter. "Did He give it in an audible tone of
voice?"
Guitcau. "He gave it to me by his pressure upon me.'
Mr. Porter. "Did He give it to you in a vision of
the night?"
Guiteau. “I don't get my inspirations in that way."
Mr. Porter. "Did you contemplate the President's
removal otherwise than by murder?”
Guiteau. "No, sir, I do not like the word murder. I
don't like that word. If I had shot the President of the
United States on my own personal account, no punish-
ment would be too severe or too quick for me; but act-
ing as the agent of the Deity puts an entirely different
construction upon the act, and that is the thing that I
want to put into this court and the jury and the oppos-
ing counsel. I say this was an absolute necessity in
view of the political situation, for the good of the
American people, and to save the nation from another
war. That is the view I want you to entertain, and
not settle down on a cold-blooded idea of murder."
Mr. Porter. "Do you feel under great obligations to
the American people?"
Guiteau. “I think the American people may some-
time consider themselves under great obligations to
me, sir."
Mr. Porter. " Did the Republican party ever give
you an office?"
362
------
Guiteau. "I never held any kind of political office in
my life, and never drew one cent from the Government."
Mr. Porter. And never desired an office, did you?"
Guiteau. "I had some thought about the Paris con-
sulship. That is the only office that I ever had any
serious thought about."
Mr. Porter. That was the one which resulted in the
inspiration, wasn't it?
Guiteau. No, sir, most decidedly not. My getting
it or not getting it had no relation to my duty to God
and to the American people."
*
Mr. Porter. "On the 16th of June, in an address to
the American people, which you intended to be found
on your person after you had shot the President, you
said, 'I conceived the idea of removing the President
four weeks ago.' Was that a lie?
Guiteau. "I conceived it, but my mind was not fully
settled on it. There is a difference in the idea of
conceiving things and actually fixing your mind on them.
You may conceive the idea that you will go to Europe
in a month, and you may not go. That is no point at
all."
Mr. Porter. "Then there was no inspiration in the
preceding May, as you have described?"
Guiteau. "It was a mere flash."
Mr. Porter. It was an embryo inspiration?"
Guiteau. "A mere impression that came into my
363
------
mind that possibly it might have to be done. I got
the thought, and that is all I did get at that time.
Mr. Porter. "Don't you know when you were in-
spired to kill the President? '
Guiteau. "I have stated all I have got to say on that
subject. If you do not see it, I will not argue it."
Mr. Porter. "Do you think you do not know when
you were inspired to do the act?"
Guiteau. "After I got the conception, my mind was
being gradually transformed. I was finding out whether
it was the Lord's will or not. Do you understand that?
And in the end I made up my mind that it was His will.
That is the way I test the Lord."
Mr. Porter. "What was your doubt about?
Guiteau. "Because all my natural feelings were op-
posed to the act, just as any man's would be.”
Mr. Porter. "You regarded it as murder, then?"
Guiteau. "So called, yes, sir.”
Mr. Porter. "You knew it was forbidden by human
law?"
Guiteau. I expected the Deity would take care of
that. I never had any conception of the matter as a
murder."
Mr. Porter. "Why then were you in doubt?'
Guiteau. "My mind is a perfect blank on that subject,
and has been."
">
Mr. Porter. "The two weeks of doubt I am referring
to, your mind is not a blank as to that; for you told us
364
------
this morning how during those two weeks you walked
and prayed. During that time did you believe that
killing the President was forbidden by human law?"
Guiteau. "I cannot make myself understood any
more than I have. If that is not satisfactory, I cannot
do it any better."
Mr. Porter. "You mentioned the other day that you
never struck a man in your life. Was that true?"
Guiteau. "I do not recall ever striking a man, sir. I
have always been a peace man, naturally very cowardly,
and always kept away from any physical danger."
Mr. Porter. "But morally brave and determined?"
Guitcau. "I presume so, especially when I am sure
the Deity is back of me."
Mr. Porter. "When did you become sure of that?"
Guiteau. "I became sure of it about the first of June
as far as this case is concerned."
Mr. Porter. " Before that you did not think He was
back of you? Who did you think was back of you with
a suggestion of murder?"
Guiteau. "It was the Deity, sir, that made the
original suggestion."
Mr. Porter. "I thought you said that the Deity
did not make the suggestion until the first of June?"
Guiteau. "I say that the Deity did make the sug-
gestion about the middle of May, and that I was
weighing the proposition for the two weeks succeeding.
265
------
I was positive it was the will of the Deity about the first
of June."
Mr. Porter. "Whose will did you think it was
before that?"
Guiteau. "It was the Deity's will. No doubt about
that."
Mr. Porter. But you were in doubt as to its being
His will?"
Guiteau. "
"I was not in any doubt."
Mr. Porter. "Not even the first two weeks?"
Guiteau. There was no doubt as to the inception of
the act from the Deity; as to the feasibility of the act,
I was in doubt."
Mr. Porter. "You differed in opinion, then, from the
Deity?"
Guiteau. "No, sir, I was testing the feasibility of the
act, whether it would be feasible."
---
Mr. Porter. "Did you suppose that the Supreme
Ruler of the Universe would order you to do a thing
which was not feasible?"
Guiteau. "No, sir, in a certain sense I did not suppose
it. He directed me to remove the President for the
good of the American people."
Mr. Porter. "Did He use the word 'remove'?"
Guiteau. That is the way it always came to my
mind. If two men quarrel, and one kills the other,
that is murder. This was not even a homicide, for I
say the Deity killed the President, and not me."
366
------
Mr. Porter. "Passing from that, your friend Thomas
North
Guiteau (interrupting). "He is no friend of mine."
Mr. Porter (continuing).
At page 422 of the evi-
dence, Thomas North says that in 1859 you struck your
father from behind his back. Is that true?'
Guiteau. "I know nothing about it, sir."
Mr. Porter. "He swears that you clinched your
father after he had risen, and that several blows were
interchanged. Is that true?'
Guiteau. "I have no recollection of any such expe-
rience, sir, at any time. I have no recollection about
it."
Mr. Porter. "Your sister swears that in 1876, when
you were thirty-five years old, that at her place, while
you were an inmate of her family, you raised an axe
against her life. Is that true?"
Guiteau. "I don't know anything about it, sir."
Mr. Porter. “You heard the testimony, didn't you?"
Guiteau. I heard it."
Mr. Porter. "You heard your lawyer, in his opening,
allude to that evidence, and you shouted out at the time
that it was false?"
Guiteau. That is what I did say, but you need not
look so fierce on me. I do not care a snap for your
fierce look. Just cool right down. I am not afraid of
you, just understand that. Go a little slow. Make
your statements in a quiet, genial way."
367
------
Mr. Porter. "Well, it
Well, it comes to this then, you
thought God needed your assistance in order to kill
President Garfield?
Guiteau. "I decline to discuss this matter with you
any further."
Mr. Porter. "You thought that the Supreme Power,
which holds the gifts of life and death, wanted to send
the President to Paradise for breaking the unity of the
Republican party, and for ingratitude to General Grant
and Senator Conkling?"
Guitcau. "I think his Christian character had noth-
ing to do whatever with his political record. Please put
that down. His political record was in my opinion very
poor, but his Christian character was good. I myself
looked upon him as a good Christian man. But he was
President of the United States, and he was in condition
to do this republic vast harm, and for this reason the
Lord wanted him removed, and asked me to do it."
Mr. Porter. "Have you any communication with the
Deity as to your daily acts?"
Guiteau. "Only on extraordinary actions. He super-
vises my private affairs, I hope, to some extent.”
Mr. Porter. "Was He with you when you were a
lawyer?"
Guiteau. "Not especially, sir."
Mr. Porter. When you were an unsuccessful law-
yer?"
Guiteau. "Not especially, sir."
368
------
Mr. Porter. "Was He with you when you were a
pamphlet pedler?"
Guiteau. "I think He was, and took very good care
of me."
Mr. Porter. "He left your board bills unpaid?"
Guiteau. "Some of them are paid. If the Lord
wanted me to go around preaching the gospel as I was
doing as a pamphlet pedler, I had to do my work,
and let Him look for the result. That is the way the
Saviour and Paul got in their work. They did not
get any money in their business, and I was doing the
same kind of work."
Mr. Porter. "I think you were kind enough to say
that the Saviour and Paul were vagabonds on earth?”
Guiteau. "That is the fact, I suppose, from the
record. They did not have any money or any friends."
Mr. Porter. "Do you think that is irreverent?”
Guitcau. "Not in this case. I think it is decidedly
proper, because the Saviour Himself said that He had
nowhere to lay His head. Is not that being a vagabond?"
Mr. Porter. "Did you think it was irreverent when
you said you belonged to the firm, or were working for
the firm, of 'Jesus Christ and Company'?"
Guiteau. "It is barely possible I may have used that
expression in one of my letters years ago."
Mr. Porter. Did you not hear such a letter read
on this trial?”
Guiteau. “If I wrote it, I thought so."
369
2 A
------
Mr. Porter. "In your letter to the American people,
written on the sixteenth of June, more than two weeks
before the assassination, did you say, 'It will make my
friend Arthur President'?"
Guiteau. I considered General Arthur my friend
at that time, and do now. He was a Stalwart, and I
had more intimate personal relations with him than I
did with Garfield."
Mr. Porter. Had General Arthur, now President,
ever done anything for you?
Guiteau. Not especially, but I was with him every
day and night during the canvass in New York except
Sundays. We were Christian men there and we did
no work on Sundays."
Mr. Porter. You never had any conversation with
him about murder, did you?"
Guiteau. "No, sir, I did not."
Mr. Porter. "Did you, in this letter of the sixteenth
of June, say, 'I have sacrificed only one'?"
Guiteau. "I said one life. The word 'life' should be
put in.”
Mr. Porter. "That is implied, but not expressed?"
Guiteau. "Now I object to your picking out sen-
tences here and there in my letter. You want to read
the entire letter. I said something there about General
Arthur and General Grant. You have left all that out.
You are giving a twist on one word. I decline to talk
with a man of that character."
370
------
Mr. Porter. "Did you think you had sacrificed one
life?"
Guiteau. "I can remember it. This is the way \[dra-
matically\],- This is not murder. It is a political neces-
sity. It will make my friend Arthur President and save
the republic. Grant, during the war, sacrificed thousands.
of lives to save the republic. I have sacrificed only
one. \[Coolly.\] Put it in that shape and then you will
get sense out of it."
Mr. Porter. “When you sacrificed that one life, it
was by shooting him with the bull-dog pistol you
bought?
Guiteau. "Yes, sir, it was. That should have been
my inspiration. Those are the words that ought to
go in there, meaning the Deity and me, and then you
would have got the full and accurate statement. I did
not do this work on my own account, and you cannot
persuade this court and the American people ever to
believe I did. The Deity inspired the act. He has
taken care of it so far, and He will take care of it."
Mr. Porter. "Did the American people kill General
Garfield?"
Guiteau. "I decline to talk to you on that subject,
sir. You are a very mean man and a very dishon-
est man to try to make my letters say what they do
not say.
That is my opinion of you, Judge Porter.
I know something about you when in New York.
I have seen you shake your bony fingers at the jury
------
and the court, and I repudiate your whole theory on
this business."
Mr. Porter. "Did it occur to you that there was a
commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill '?"
Guiteau. "It did. The divine authority overcame
the written law."
Mr. Porter. "Is there any higher divine authority
than the authority that spoke in the commandments?"
Guiteau. "To me there was, sir."
Mr. Porter. It spoke to you?"
Guiteau. "A special divine authority to do that
particular act, sir."
Mr. Porter. "And when you pointed that pistol at
General Garfield and sent that bullet into his back-
bone, you believed that it was not you, but God, that
pulled that trigger?"
Guiteau. "He used me as an agent to pull the trigger,
-put it in that shape, but I had no option in the
matter. If I had, I would not have done it. Put that
down."
-
Mr. Porter. Did you walk back and forth in front
of the door of the ladies' room, watching for the entrance
of the President?"
Guiteau. "I walked backwards and forwards, work-
ing myself up, as I knew the hour had come."
Mr. Porter. "Was it necessary to do that to obey
God?"
Guiteau. "I told you I had all I could possibly do
372
------
to do the act anyway. I had to work myself up and
rouse myself up."
Mr. Porter. "Why?"
Guiteau. "Because all my natural feelings were
against the act, but I had to obey God Almighty if I
died the next second, and God had put the work on to
me, and I had to do it.'
Mr. Porter. "Did you mind about dying the next
second?"
Guiteau. "I knew nothing about what would become
of me, sir."
Mr. Porter. "Why did you engage that colored
man? Was it to drive you to a place of safety?"
Guiteau. "I engaged him to drive me to the jail."
Mr. Porter. Did you think you would be safer
there?"
Guiteau. "I did not know but what I would be torn
to pieces before I got there."
Mr. Porter. Weren't you a little afraid of it after
you got there?"
Guiteau. "I had no fear about it at all, sir."
Mr. Porter. "Why did you write to General Sher-
man to send troops?
Guiteau. "I wanted protection, sir."
Mr. Porter.

Guiteau. "I expected there would be danger, of
course."
373
------
Mr. Porter. Why should there be danger ?
Guiteau. "I knew the people would not understand
my view about it, and would not understand my idea
of inspiration, that they would look upon me as a
horrible wretch for shooting the President of the
United States."
Mr. Porter. "As a murderer?
Guiteau. "Yes, I suppose that is so."
Mr. Porter. “ Did you suppose they would hang you
for it?"
Guiteau. "No, sir. I expected the Deity would take
care of me until I could tell the American people that I
simply acted as His agent; hence, I wanted protection
from General Sherman until the people cooled off and
got possession of my views on the matter. I was not
going to put myself in the possession of the wild mob.
I wanted them to have time to tone down so that they
could have an opportunity to know that it was not my
personal act, but it was the act of the Deity and me
associated, and I wanted the protection of these troops,
and the Deity has taken care of me from that day to
this."
Mr. Porter. Have you any evidence of that except
your own statement?"
Guiteau. "I know it as well as I know that I am
alive."
Mr. Porter. “It depends upon whether the jury be-
lieve that?"

to
Guiteau. "That is just what the jury is here for,
take into account my actions for twenty years, my travel-
ling around the country and developing a new system of
theology, and the way the Deity has taken care of me
since the second of July, and then the jury are to pass upon
the question whether I did this thing jointly with the
Deity, or whether I did it on my own personal account.
I tell you, sir, that I expect, if it is necessary, that there
will be an act of God to protect me from any kind of
violence, either by hanging or shooting.”
Mr. Porter. Did the Deity tell you that?"
Guiteau. "That is my impression about it, sir."
Mr. Porter. Oh, it is your impression. Have you
not had some mistaken impressions in the course of
your life?"
---
Guiteau. "Never, sir, in this kind of work. I always
test the Deity by prayer."
Mr. Porter. "Why did you think you would go to
jail for obeying a command of God?
Guiteau. "I wanted to go there for protection. I did
not want a lot of wild men going to jail there. I would
have been shot and hung a hundred times if it had not
been for those troops."
Mr. Porter. "Would there have been any wrong in
that?"
Guiteau. "I won't have any more discussion with you
on this sacred subject. You are making light of a very
sacred subject and I won't talk to you."
275
------
Mr. Porter. "Did you think to shoot General Gar
field without trial - "
Guiteau (interrupting). "I decline to discuss the
matter with you, sir."
Mr. Porter. Had Garfield ever been tried?"
Guiteau. "I decline to discuss the matter with you,
sir."
Mr. Porter. "Did God tell you he had to be mur-
dered?"
Guiteau. "He told me he had to be removed, sir."
Mr. Porter. "Did He tell you General Garfield had
to be killed without trial?”
Guiteau. He told me he had to be removed, sir."
Mr. Porter. "When did He tell you so?"
Guiteau. "I decline to discuss the matter with you."
Mr. Porter. "Would it incriminate you if you were
to answer the jury that question?"
Guiteau. "I don't know whether it would or not."
*
Mr. Porter. "What is your theory of your defence?"
Guiteau. "I have stated it very frequently. If you
have not got comprehension enough to see it by this
time, I won't attempt to enlighten you."
Mr. Porter. "It is that you are legally insane, and
not in fact insane, is it?"
Guiteau. "The defence is, sir, that it was the Deity's
act and not mine, and He will take care of it."
Mr. Porter. "Are
Are you insane at all?"
376
------
Guiteau. "A great many people think I am very
badly insane. My father thought I was. My relatives
think I am badly cranked, and always have thought I
was off my base."
Mr. Porter. "You told the jury you were not in fact
insane?"
Guiteau. "I am not an expert. Let the experts and
the jury decide whether I am insane or not. That is
what they are here for."
Mr. Porter. Do you believe you are insane?
Guiteau. "I decline to answer the question, sir."
Mr. Porter. "You did answer before that you were
legally insane, did you not? Did you not so state in
open court?
ور
66
Guiteau. "I decline to discuss that with you, sir.
My opinion would not be of any value one way or the
other. I am not an expert, and not a juryman, and not
the court."

CHAPTER XVII
THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF RUSSELL SAGE IN LAIDLAW V.
SAGE (SECOND TRIAL) BY HON. JOSEPH H. CHOATE
ONE of the most recent cross-examinations to be made
the subject of appeal to the Supreme Court General
Term and the New York Court of Appeals was the
cross-examination of Russell Sage by the Hon. Joseph H.
Choate in the famous suit brought against the former
by William R. Laidlaw. Sage was defended by the late
Edwin C. James, and Mr. Choate appeared for the
plaintiff, Mr. Laidlaw.
On the fourth day of December, 1891, a stranger by
the name of Norcross came to Russell Sage's New
York office and sent a message to him that he wanted
to see him on important business, and that he had a
letter of introduction from Mr. John Rockefeller. Mr.
Sage left his private office, and going up to Norcross,
was handed an open letter which read, “This carpet-bag
I hold in my hand contains ten pounds of dynamite, and
if I drop this bag on the floor it will destroy this building
in ruins and kill every human being in it. I demand
twelve hundred thousand dollars, or I will drop it. Will
you give it? Yes or no?"
378
------
Mr. Sage read the letter, handed it back to Norcross,
and suggested that he had a gentleman waiting for him
in his private office, and could be through his business
in a couple of minutes when he would give the matter
his attention.
Norcross responded: "Then you decline my proposi-
tion? Will you give it to me? Yes or no?" Sage
explained again why he would have to postpone giving
it to him for two or three minutes to get rid of some one
in his private office, and just at this juncture Mr. Laid-
law entered the office, saw Norcross and Sage without
hearing the conversation, and waited in the anteroom
until Sage should be disengaged. As he waited, Sage
edged toward him and partly seating himself upon the
table near Mr. Laidlaw, and without addressing him,
took him by the left hand as if to shake hands with him,
but with both his own hands, and drew Mr. Laidlaw
almost imperceptibly around between him and Norcross.
As he did so, he said to Norcross, "If you cannot trust
me, how can you expect me to trust you?"
With that there was a terrible explosion. Norcross
himself was blown to pieces and instantly killed. Mr.
Laidlaw found himself on the floor on top of Russell
Sage. He was seriously injured, and later brought suit
against Mr. Sage for damages upon the ground that he
had purposely made a shield of his body from the ex-
pected explosion. Mr. Sage denied that he had made
a shield of Laidlaw or that he had taken him by the
270
------
hand or altered his own position so as to bring Laid-
law between him and the explosion.
The case was tried four times. It was dismissed by
Mr. Justice Andrews, and upon appeal the judgment
was reversed. On the second trial before Mr. Justice
Patterson the jury rendered a verdict of $25,000 in favor
of Mr. Laidlaw. On appeal this judgment in turn was
reversed. On a third trial, also before Mr. Justice
Patterson, the jury disagreed; and on the fourth trial
before Mr. Justice Ingraham the jury rendered a ver-
dict in favor of Mr. Laidlaw of $40,000, which judg-
ment was sustained by the General Term of the
Supreme Court, but subsequently reversed by the
Court of Appeals.
Exception on this appeal was taken especially to the
method used in the cross-examination of Mr. Sage by
Mr. Choate. Thus the cross-examination is interesting,
as an instance of what the New York Court of Appeals
has decided to be an abuse of cross-examination into
which, through their zeal, even eminent counsel are
sometimes led, and to which I have referred in a pre-
vious chapter. It also shows to what lengths Mr.
Choate was permitted to go upon the pretext of test-
ing the witness's memory.
It was claimed by Mr. Sage's counsel upon the appeal
that "the right of cross-examination was abused in this
case to such an extent as to require the reversal of this
monstrous judgment, which is plainly the precipitation
380
------
and product of that abuse." And the Court of Appeals
unanimously took this view of the matter.
After Mr. Sage had finished his testimony in his own
behalf, Mr. Choate rose from his chair to cross-examine;
he sat on the table back of the counsel table, swinging
his legs idly, regarded the witness smilingly, and then
began in an unusually low voice.
Mr. Choate. "Where do you reside, Mr. Sage?"
Mr. Sage. At 506 Fifth Avenue."
Mr. Choate (still in a very low tone). "And what is
your age now?"
Mr. Sage (promptly). "Seventy-seven years.'
Mr. Choate (with a strong raising of his voice). “Do
you ordinarily hear as well as you have heard the two
questions you have answered me?"
Mr. Sage (looking a bit surprised and answering in an
almost inaudible voice). "Why, yes."
Mr. Choate. "Did you lose your voice by the ex-
plosion?"
Mr. Sage. "No."
Mr. Choate. "You spoke louder when you were in
Congress, didn't you?"
Mr. Sage. "I may have."
Mr. Choate, resuming the conversational tone, began
an unexpected line of questions by asking in a small-
talk voice, "What jewelry do you ordinarily wear?
Witness answered that he was not in the habit of wear-
ing jewelry.
381
------
Mr. Choate. Do you wear a watch?"
Mr. Sage. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. And you ordinarily carry it as you
carry the one you have at present in your left vest
pocket?"
Mr. Sage. "Yes, I suppose so."
Mr. Choate. Was your watch hurt by the explo-
66
66
sion?"
Mr. Sage. "I believe not."
Mr. Choate. "It was not even stopped by the explo-
sion which perforated your vest with missiles?"
Mr. Sage. "I do not remember about this."
nervous.
The witness did not quite enjoy this line of question-
ing, and swung his eye-glasses as if he were a trifle
Mr. Choate, after regarding him in silence
for some time, said, "I see you wear eye-glasses." The
witness closed his glasses and put them in his vest
pocket, whereupon Mr. Choate resumed, And when
you do not wear them, you carry them, I see, in your
vest pocket."
66
Mr. Choate. "Were your glasses hurt by that explo-
sion which inflicted forty-seven wounds on your chest? "
Mr. Sage. "I do not remember."
Mr. Choate. "You certainly would remember if you
had to buy a new pair?"
If the witness answered this question, his answer
was lost in the laughter which the court officer could
not instantly check.
382
------
Mr. Choate. "These clothes you brought here to show,
you are sure they are the same you wore that day?"
Mr. Sage. 'Yes."
Mr. Choate. "How do you know?"
Mr. Sage. The same as you would know in a mat-
ter of that kind."
Mr. Choate. "Were you familiar with these clothes?"
Mr. Sage. "Yes, sir."
Mr. Choate. "How
long had
"How long had you had them?”
Mr. Sage. "Oh, some months."
Mr. Choate. "Had you had them three or four
years?"
Mr. Sage. "No."
Mr. Choate. "And wore them daily except on Sun-
days?"
Mr. Sage. "I think not; they were too heavy for
summer wear."
Mr. Choate. “Do you remember looking out of the
window that morning when you got up to see if it was
cloudy so you would know whether to wear the old
suit or not?"
Mr. Sage. "I do not remember."
Mr. Choate. "Well, let that go now; how is your
general health,---good as a man of seventy-seven could
expect? "
Good except for my hearing."
Mr. Sage. "Good except for
Mr. Choate. "And that is impaired to the extent
demonstrated here on this cross-examination?'
383
------
The witness did not answer this question, and after
some more kindly inquiries regarding his health, Mr.
Choate began an even more intimate inquiry concerning
the business career of Mr. Sage.
He learned that the millionaire was born in Verona,
Oneida County, went to Troy when he was eleven years
old, and was in business there until 1863, when he came
to this city.
Mr. Choate. "What was your business in Troy?"
Mr. Sage. Merchant."
Mr. Choate. " What kind of a merchant?"
Mr. Sage. “A grocer, and I was afterwards engaged
in banking and railroad operating."
Mr. Sage, as a railroad builder, excited Mr. Choate's
liveliest interest. He wanted to know all about that,
the name of every road he had built or helped to build,
when he had done this, and with whom he had
been associated in doing it. He frequently outlined
his questions by explaining that he did not wish to ask
the witness any impudent questions, but merely wanted
to test his memory. The financier would sometimes
say that to answer some questions he would have to
refer to his books, and then the lawyer would pretend
great surprise that the witness could not remember
even the names of roads he had built. Mr. Sage said,
"Possibly we might differ as to what is aiding a road.
Some I have aided as a director, and some as a stock-
holder."
384
------
No, we won't differ; we will divide the question,"
Mr. Choate said. "First name the roads you have aided
in building as a director, and then the roads you have
aided in building as a stockholder." The witness either
would not, or could not, and after worrying him with a
hundred questions on this line, Mr. Choate finally
exclaimed, "Well, we will let that go."
Next the cross-examiner brought the witness to con-
sider his railroad-building experience after he left Troy
and came to New York, whereby he managed, under
the license of testing the memory of the witness, to
show the jury the intimate financial relations which
had existed between Mr. Sage and Mr. Jay Gould, and
finally asked the witness point blank how many roads
he had assisted in building in connection with Mr.
Gould as director or stockholder.
After some very
lively sparring the witness thought that he had been
connected in one way or another in about thirty rail-
roads. "Name them!" exclaimed Mr. Choate. The
witness named three and then stopped.
"There are
Mr. Choate (looking at his list).
twenty-seven more. Please hurry, you do business
much faster than this in your office!"
Mr. Sage said something about a number of aux-
iliary roads that had been consolidated, and roads that
had been merged, and unimportant roads whose directors
met very seldom, and again said something about refer-
ring to his books.
------
Mr. Choate. "Your books have nothing to do with
what I am trying to determine, which is a question of
your memory."
The witness continued to spar, and at last Mr.
Choate exclaimed, "Now is it not true that you have
millions and millions of dollars in roads that you have
not named here?
All of the counsel for the defence were on their feet,
objecting to this question, and Mr. Choate withdrew it,
and added, "It appears you cannot remember, and
won't you please say so?"
The witness would not say so, and Mr. Choate ex-
claimed, "Well, I give that up," and then asked, "You
say you are a banker; what kind of a bank do you run,
-is it a bank of deposit?" The witness said it was
not, and neither was it a bank for circulating notes.
Sometimes I have money to lend," he said.
Mr. Choate. "Oh, you are a money lender. You
buy puts and calls and straddles?" The witness said
that he dealt in these privileges. "Kindly explain to
the jury just what puts and calls and straddles are,"
the lawyer said encouragingly. The witness answered:
"They are means to assist men of moderate capital to
operate."
Mr. Choate. A sort of benevolent institution, eh?"
Mr. Sage. "It is in a sense.
erate means an opportunity to
business."

learn the methods of
------
Mr. Choate. Do you refer to puts or calls?"
Mr. Sage. "To both."
Mr. Choate. "I do not understand."
Mr. Sage. "I thought you would not" (with a
chuckle).
Mr. Choate affected a puzzled look, and asked slowly:
"Is it something like this: they call it and you put it?
If it goes down they get the chargeable benefit, but
if it goes up you get it?
""
Mr. Sage. "I only get what I am paid for the privi-
lege."
Mr. Choate. "Now what is a straddle ?
Mr. Sage. A straddle is the privilege of calling or
putting."
Why," exclaimed Mr. Choate, with raised eyebrows,
" that seems to me like a game of chance."
Mr. Sage. "It is a game of the fluctuation of the
market."
That is another way of putting it," Mr. Choate com-
mended, looking as if he did not intend the pun. Then
he asked, "The market once went very heavy against
you in this game, did it not?"
Yes, it did," the witness replied.
Mr. Choate. "That was an occasion when your cus-
tomers could call, but not put, eh?"
Mr. Sage looked as if he did not understand and
made no reply. Mr. Choate then added: "Did you not
then have a run on your office?" The witness made
------
some reply, hardly audible, concerning a party of Balti-
more roughs, who made a row about his office for an
hour when he refused to admit them.
This phase of the question was left in that vague con-
dition, and the cross-examiner opened a new subject and
unfolded a three-column clipping from a newspaper,
which was headed, "A Chat with Russell Sage."
Mr. Choate. The reporters called on you soon after
the explosion?"
Mr. Sage. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "One visited your house?
66
"9
Mr. Sage. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "Did you read over what he wrote?"
Mr. Sage. "No."
Mr. Choate. "Did you read this after it was printed?'
Mr. Sage. "I believe I did."
Mr. Choate. "It is correct?"
Mr. Sage. "Reporters sometimes go on their own
imagination."
It developed that the article which Mr. Choate re-
ferred to was written by a grand-nephew of the witness.
When it had thus been identified, Mr. Choate again
asked the witness if the article was correct.
Colonel James exclaimed: "Are you asking him to
swear to the correctness of an article from that paper?
Nobody could do that."
"No," Mr. Choate quickly responded, "I am asking
him to point out its errors. Any one can do that."
288
------
This," said Colonel James, "is making a comedy of
errors."
The witness broke in upon this little relaxation with
the remark, "The reporter who wrote that was only in
my house five minutes."
"Indeed," exclaimed Mr. Choate, waving the three-
column clipping, "he got a great deal out of you, and
that is more than I have been able to do."
The first extract from the newspaper clipping read
as follows: "Mr. Sage looks hale and hearty for an old
man, looks good for many years of life yet."
Mr.
Choate. "Is that true?"
Mr. Sage. "We all try to hold our own as long as
""
we can.'
Mr. Choate. "You speak for yourself, when you say
we all try to hold on to all that we can.”
At this Mr. James jumped to his feet again, and
there was another spirited passage at arms. When all
had quieted down, Mr. Sage was next asked if the
article was correct when it referred to him as looking
like a
"warrior after the battle." He thought that the
statement was overdrawn. The article referred to
Mr. Sage's having shaved himself that morning, which
was three mornings after the explosion; and when he
had read that, Mr. Choate asked: "Did you have any
wounds at that time that a visitor could see?"
The witness replied that both of his hands were then
bandaged.
------
Mr. Choate. "You must have shaved yourself with
your feet."
*
Mr. Choate. "Was it a relief to you to see Laidlaw
enter the office when you were talking to Norcross?"
Mr. Sage. "No, and if Laidlaw had stayed out in
the lobby instead of coming into my office, he would
have been by Norcross when the explosion took place."
Mr. Choate. Then you think Laidlaw is indebted
to you for saving his life instead of your being indebted
to him for saving yours?"
Mr. Sage (decidedly). "Yes, sir."
Mr. Choate. Oh, that makes this a very simple
case, then.
Did you bring your clerk here to testify
as to the condition of the office after the police had
cleared it out?"
Mr. Sage. "I did not bring him here, my counsel did.”
Mr. Choate. "I see; you do not do any barking when
you have a dog to do it for you."
Lawyers Dillon and James jumped up, and Mr. James
said gravely, "Which of us is referred to as a dog?"
Mr. Choate (laughingly). “Oh, all of us."
Mr. Choate seldom reproved the witness for the char-
acter of his answers, although when he was examined
by Colonel James on the redirect he was treated with
very much less courtesy, for the Colonel frequently
requested him, and rather roughly, to be good enough
to confine his answers to the question.
300
------
Mr. Choate's next question referred to the diagram
which had been in use up to that point. He asked the
witness if it was correct.
Mr. Sage. "I think it is not quite correct, not quite;
if the jury will go down there, I would be glad to have
them, be glad to do anything. If the jury will go down
there, I would be very glad to furnish their transportation,
- if they will go."
Mr. Choate. If you won't furnish anything but trans-
portation, they won't go."
Mr. Sage. "It is substantially correct. I had a dia-
gram made and I offered an opportunity to Mr. Laid-
law's counsel to have a correct one made. I never
withheld anything from anybody."
The diagram which Mr. Sage had prepared was pro-
duced, and upon examination it was seen that it con-
tained lines indicating a wrong rule, and had some
other inaccuracies which did not seem to amount to
much really; but Mr. Choate appeared to be very much
impressed with these differences.
"I want you," he said to the witness, "to reconcile
your testimony with your own diagram."
The witness looked at the diagram for some time, and
Mr. Choate, observing him, remarked, “You will have to
make a straddle to reconcile that, won't you?"
Some marks and signs of erasures were seen on the
Sage diagram, which gave Mr. Choate an opportunity to
ask, in a sensational tone, if any one could inform him
391

who had been tampering with it. No one could, and
the diagram was dropped and the subject of a tattered
suit of clothes taken up again.
Mr. Choate. "What tailor did you employ at the
time of the explosion?"
Mr. Sage. "Several."
Mr. Choate. "Name them; I want to follow up these
clothes."
Mr. Sage. "Tailor Jessup made the coat and vest."
Mr. Choate. Where is his place ?"
Mr. Sage. "On Broadway."
Mr. Choate. "Is he there now?'
Mr. Sage. "Oh, no, he has gone to heaven."
Mr. Choate. "To heaven where all good tailors go?
Who made the trousers?"
Mr. Sage. "I cannot tell where I may have bought
them."
Mr. Choate. Bought them? You do not buy ready-
made trousers, do you?"
Mr. Sage. "I do sometimes. I get a better fit."
Mr. Choate. Get benefit?"
Mr. Sage. "No; better fit."
Mr. Choate. Where is the receipt for them?"
Mr. Sage. "I have none.”
Mr. Choate. Do you pay money without receipts?"
Mr. Sage. "I do sometimes."
Mr. Choate. “
Indeed?"
Mr. Sage. "Yes; you do not take a receipt for your hat."

The vest was then produced, and two holes in the
outer cloth were exhibited by Mr. Choate, who asked the
witness if these were the places where the foreign sub-
stances entered which penetrated his body. The wit-
ness replied that they were, and Mr. Choate next
asked him if he had had the vest relined. Mr. Sage
replied that he had not. How is it, then," Mr. Choate
asked, passing the vest to the jury with great satisfaction,
that these holes do not penetrate the lining?" The
witness said that he could not explain that, but insisted
that that was the vest and it would have to speak for
itself. Mr. Choate again took the vest and counted six
holes on the cloth on the other side, and asked the wit-
ness if that count was right. Mr. Sage replied, “I
will take your count," and then caused a laugh by sud-
denly reaching out for the vest, and saying, “ If you have
no objection, though, I would like to see it."
Mr. Choate. "Now are not three of these holes moth-
eaten?"
Mr. Sage. "I think not."
Mr. Choate. Are you a judge of moth-eaten goods?"
Mr. Sage. "No."
Mr. Choate. "Where is the shirt you wore?"
Mr. Sage. "Destroyed."
Mr. Choate. "By whom?"
Mr. Sage. "The cook."
Mr. Choate. "The cook?'
Mr. Sage. "I meant the laundress."
303
------
The vest was passed to the jury for their inspection,
and the jurymen got into an eager whispered discussion
as to whether certain of the holes were moth-eaten or
not. There was a tailor on the jury. Observing the
discussion, Mr. Choate took back the garment and said
in his most winning way, "Now we don't want the jury
to disagree." He next held up the coat, which was very
much more injured in the tails than in front, and asked
the witness how he accounted for that.
Mr. Sage. "It is one of the freaks of electricity."
Mr. Choate. 'One of those things no fellow can find
out."
The witness could not recall how much he had paid
for the coat or for any of the garments, and after an
unsuccessful attempt to identify the maker of the
trousers by the name of the button, which proved to be
the name of the button-maker, the old clothes were tem-
porarily allowed to rest, and Mr. Choate asked the witness
how long he had been unconscious. He replied that
he thought he was unconscious two seconds.
Mr. Choate. How did you know you were not
unconscious ten minutes?"
Mr. Sage. "Only from what Mr. Walker says.”
Mr. Choate. "Where is he?"
Mr. Sage. "On the Street."
Mr. Choate. "On Chambers Street, downstairs?
Mr. Sage. "No, on Wall Street."
Mr. Choate. "Oh, I forgot that the street to you means
394
------
Wall Street. Were you not up and dressed every day
after the explosion?'
66
Mr. Sage. "I cannot remember."
Mr. Choate. You did business every day?'
Mr. Sage. "Colonel Slocum and my nephew called
upon me about business, and my counsel looked after
some missing papers and bonds."
Mr. Choate. "You then held some Missouri Pacific
collateral trust bonds?"
Mr. Sage. "Yes."
Mr. Choate. "How many?"
Mr. Sage. "Cannot say."
Mr. Choate. Can't you tell within a limit of ten to
one thousand?"
Mr. Sage. "No."
Mr. Choate. "Nor within one hundred to two hun-
dred?"
Mr. Sage. "No."
Mr. Choate. "Is it because you have too little memory
or too many bonds? How many loans did you have
out at that time?"
66
Mr. Sage. "I cannot tell."
Mr. Choate. "Can you tell within two hundred thou-
sand of the amount then due you from your largest
creditor?"
Mr. Sage. "Any man doing the business I am -

the world. No, you cannot tell within two hundred

Mr. Sage. "I do."
Mr. Choate. Were you not very excited ?"

did not believe his dynamite would do so much damage,
or that he would sacrifice himself.

CHAPTER XVIII
GOLDEN RULES FOR THE EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES
DAVID PAUL BROWN, a very able nisi prius lawyer of
great experience at the Philadelphia Bar, many years
ago condensed his experiences into eighteen paragraphs
which he entitled, "Golden Rules for the Examination
of Witnesses."
Although I am of the opinion that it is impossible to
embody in any set of rules the art of examination of wit-
nesses, yet the “Golden Rules" contain so many useful
and valuable suggestions that it is well to reprint them
here for the benefit of the student.
Golden Rules for the Examination of Witnesses
First, as to your own witnesses.
I. If they are bold, and may injure your cause by pert-
ness or forwardness, observe a gravity and ceremony of
manner toward them which may be calculated to repress
their assurance.
II. If they are alarmed or diffident, and their thoughts
are evidently scattered, commence your examination
with matters of a familiar character, remotely connected
with the subject of their alarm, or the matter in issue; as,
207
------
for instance, --- Where do you live? Do you know the
parties? How long have you known them? etc. And
when you have restored them to their composure, and
the mind has regained its equilibrium, proceed to the
more essential features of the case, being careful to be
mild and distinct in your approaches, lest you may again
trouble the fountain from which you are to drink.
III. If the evidence of your own witnesses be unfavor-
able to you (which should always be carefully guarded
against), exhibit no want of composure; for there are
many minds that form opinions of the nature or char-
acter of testimony chiefly from the effect which it may
appear to produce upon the counsel.
IV. If you perceive that the mind of the witness is
imbued with prejudices against your client, hope but
little from such a quarter. unless there be some facts
which are essential to your client's protection, and which
that witness alone can prove, either do not call him, or
get rid of him as soon as possible. If the opposite coun-
sel perceive the bias to which I have referred, he may
employ it to your ruin. In judicial inquiries, of all pos-
sible evils, the worst and the least to be resisted is an
enemy in the disguise of a friend. You cannot impeach
him; you cannot cross-examine him; you cannot dis-
arm him; you cannot indirectly, even, assail him; and
if you exercise the only privilege that is left to you, and
call other witnesses for the purposes of explanation, you
must bear in mind that, instead of carrying the war into
398
------
GOLDEN RULES FOR EXAMINING WITNESSES
the enemy's country, the struggle is still between sections
of your own forces, and in the very heart, perhaps, of your
own camp. Avoid this, by all means.
V. Never call a witness whom your adversary will be
compelled to call. This will afford you the privilege of
cross-examination, take from your opponent the same
privilege it thus gives to you, and, in addition thereto,
not only render everything unfavorable said by the wit-
ness doubly operative against the party calling him, but
also deprive that party of the power of counteracting the
effect of the testimony.
VI. Never ask a question without an object, nor
without being able to connect that object with the case,
if objected to as irrelevant.
VII. Be careful not to put your question in such a
shape that, if opposed for informality, you cannot sustain
it, or, at all events, produce strong reason in its support.
Frequent failures in the discussions of points of evidence
enfeeble your strength in the estimation of the jury, and
greatly impair your hopes in the final result.
-
VIII. Never object to a question from your adversary
without being able and disposed to enforce the objection.
Nothing is so monstrous as to be constantly making
and withdrawing objections; it either indicates a want
of correct perception in making them, or a deficiency of
real or of moral courage in not making them good.

and make him also speak distinctly and to your question.
How can it be supposed that the court and jury will be
inclined to listen, when the only struggle seems to be
whether the counsel or the witness shall first go to sleep?
X. Modulate your voice as circumstances may direct,
Inspire the fearful and repress the bold."
XI. Never begin before you are ready, and always
finish when you have done.
have done. In other words, do not ques-
tion for question's sake, but for an answer.
Cross-examination
I. Except in indifferent matters, never take your eye
from that of the witness; this is a channel of communi-
cation from mind to mind, the loss of which nothing can
compensate.
"Truth, falsehood, hatred, anger, scorn, despair,
And all the passions - all the soul --- is there."
II. Be not regardless, either, of the voice of the wit-
ness; next to the eye this is perhaps the best interpreter
of his mind. The very design to screen conscience
from crime the mental reservation of the witness
is often manifested in the tone or accent or emphasis of
the voice. For instance, it becoming important to know
that the witness was at the corner of Sixth and Chestnut
streets at a certain time, the question is asked, Were
you at the corner of Sixth and Chestnut streets at six
o'clock? A frank witness would answer, perhaps I
400
-
-
------
was near there. But a witness who had been there, de-
sirous to conceal the fact, and to defeat your object,
speaking to the letter rather than the spirit of the in-
quiry, answers, No; although he may have been within
a stone's throw of the place, or at the very place, within
ten minutes of the time. The common answer of such
a witness would be, I was not at the corner at six o'clock.
Emphasis upon both words plainly implies a mental
evasion or equivocation, and gives rise with a skilful
examiner to the question, At what hour were you at the
corner, or at what place were you at six o'clock? And
in nine instances out of ten it will appear, that the wit-
ness was at the place about the time, or at the time
about the place. There is no scope for further illustra-
tions; but be watchful, I say, of the voice, and the
principle may be easily applied.
III. Be mild with the mild; shrewd with the crafty;
confiding with the honest; merciful to the young,
the frail, or the fearful; rough to the ruffian, and a
thunderbolt to the liar. But in all this, never be un-
mindful of your own dignity. Bring to bear all the
powers of your mind, not that you may shine, but that
virtue may triumph, and your cause may prosper.
IV. In a criminal, especially in a capital case, so long
as your cause stands well, ask but few questions; and
be certain never to ask any the answer to which, if
against you, may destroy your client, unless you know
the witness perfectly well, and know that his answer will
------
be favorable equally well; or unless you be prepared with
testimony to destroy him, if he play traitor to the truth
and your expectations.
V. An equivocal question is almost as much to be
avoided and condemned as an equivocal answer; and it
always leads to, or excuses, an equivocal answer. Single-
ness of purpose, clearly expressed, is the best trait in the
examination of witnesses, whether they be honest or the
reverse. Falsehood is not detected by cunning, but by
the light of truth, or if by cunning, it is the cunning of
the witness, and not of the counsel.
VI. If the witness determine to be witty or refractory
with you, you had better settle that account with him at
first, or its items will increase with the examination.
Let him have an opportunity of satisfying himself either
that he has mistaken your power, or his own. But in
any result, be careful that you do not lose your temper;
anger is always either the precursor or evidence of
assured defeat in every intellectual conflict.
VII. Like a skilful chess-player, in every move, fix
your mind upon the combinations and relations of the
game-partial and temporary success may otherwise
end in total and remediless defeat.
VIII. Never undervalue your adversary, but stand
steadily upon your guard; a random blow may be just
as fatal as though it were directed by the most consum-
mate skill; the negligence of one often cures, and some-
times renders effective, the blunders of another.
402
------
IX. Be respectful to the court and to the jury; kind
to your colleague; civil to your antagonist; but never
sacrifice the slightest principle of duty to an overweening
deference toward either.
In “The Advocate, his Training, Practice, Rights, and
Duties," written by Cox, and published in England about
a half century ago, there is an excellent chapter on cross-
examination, to which the writer is indebted for many
suggestions. Cox closes his chapter with this final
admonition to the students, to whom his book is evi-
dently addressed:
In concluding these remarks on cross-examination,
the rarest, the most useful, and the most difficult to be
acquired of the accomplishments of the advocate, we
would again urge upon your attention the importance
of calm discretion. In addressing a jury you may some-
times talk without having anything to say, and no harm
will come of it. But in cross-examination every question
that does not advance your cause injures it. If you have
not a definite object to attain, dismiss the witness with-
out a word. There are no harmless questions here; the
most apparently unimportant may bring destruction or
victory. If the summit of the orator's art has been
rightly defined to consist in knowing when to sit down,
that of an advocate may be described as knowing when
to keep his seat. Very little experience in our courts
will teach you this lesson, for every day will show to your
observant eye instances of self-destruction brought about
-
------
by imprudent cross-examination. Fear not that your
discreet reserve may be mistaken for carelessness or
want of self-reliance. The true motive will soon be
seen and approved. Your critics are lawyers, who know
well the value of discretion in an advocate; and how
indiscretion in cross-examination cannot be compensated
by any amount of ability in other duties. The attorneys
are sure to discover the prudence that governs your
tongue. Even if the wisdom of your abstinence be not
apparent at the moment, it will be recognized in the
result. Your fame
Your fame may be of slower growth than that
of the talker, but it will be larger and more enduring."
