## CROSS-EXAMINATION OF EXPERTS

In these days when it is impossible to know every-
thing, but becomes necessary for success in any avoca-
tion to know something of everything and everything
of something, the expert is more and more called upon
as a witness both in civil and criminal cases. In these
times of specialists, their services are often needed to
aid the jury in their investigations of questions of fact
relating to subjects with which the ordinary man is not
acquainted.

In our American courts, as they are now constituted,
I think I am safe in saying that in half the cases pre-
sented to a jury the evidence of one or more expert
witnesses becomes a very important factor in a juror's
effort to arrive at a just verdict. The proper handling
of these witnesses, therefore, has become of greater
importance at the present time than ever before. It is
useless for our law writers to dismiss the subject of
expert testimony, as is so often the case, by quoting
some authority like Lord Campbell, who gives it as his
final judgment, after the experience of a lifetime at the
bar and on the bench, that "skilled witnesses come with
such a bias on their minds to support the cause in which
they are embarked, that hardly any weight should be
given to their evidence;" or, as Taylor even more em-
phatically puts it in the last edition of his treatise on
the "Law of Evidence," "Expert witnesses become so
warped in their judgment by regarding the subject
in one point of view, that, even when conscientiously
disposed, _they are incapable_ of expressing a candid opin-
ion." The fact still remains that the testimony of expert
witnesses must be reckoned with in about sixty per cent
of our more important litigated business, and the only
possible way to enlighten our jurors and enable them
to arrive at a just estimate of such testimony is by a
thorough understanding of the art of cross-examination
of such witnesses.

Although the cross-examination of various experts,
whether medical, handwriting, real estate, or other spe-
cialists, is a subject of growing importance, yet it is not
intended in this chapter to do more than to make some
suggestions and to give a number of illustrations of cer-
tain methods that have been successfully adopted in the
examination of this class of witnesses.

It has become a matter of common observation that
not only can the honest opinions of different experts be
obtained upon opposite sides of the same question, but
also that dishonest opinions may be obtained upon dif-
ferent sides of the same question.

Attention is also called to the distinction between
mere matters of scientific fact and mere matters of opin-
ion. For example: certain medical experts may be
called to establish certain medical facts which are not
mere matters of opinion. On such facts the experts
could not disagree; but in the province of mere opinion
it is well known that the experts differ so much among
themselves that but little credit is given to mere expert
opinion as such.

As a general thing, it is unwise for the cross-examiner
to attempt to cope with a specialist in his own field of
inquiry. Lengthy cross-examinations along the lines of
the expert's theory are usually disastrous and should
rarely be attempted.

Many lawyers, for example, undertake to cope with a
medical or handwriting expert on his own ground,---
surgery, correct diagnosis, or the intricacies of penman-
ship. In some rare instances (more especially with
poorly educated physicians) this method of cross-ques-
tioning is productive of results. More frequently, how-
ever, it only affords an opportunity for the doctor to
enlarge upon the testimony he has already given, and to
explain what might otherwise have been misunderstood
or even entirely overlooked by the jury. Experience has
led me to believe that a physician should rarely be cross-
examined on his own specialty, unless the importance of
the case has warranted so close a study by the counsel of
the particular subject under discussion as to justify the
experiment; and then only when the lawyer's research
of the medical authorities, which he should have with
him in court, convinces him that he can expose the doc-
tor's erroneous conclusions, not only to himself, but to a
jury who will not readily comprehend the abstract theo-
ries of physiology upon which even the medical profes-
sion itself is divided.

On the other hand, some careful and judicious ques-
tions, seeking to bring out separate facts and separate
points from the knowledge and experience of the expert,
which will tend to support the theory of the attorney's
own side of the case, are usually productive of good
results. In other words, the art of the cross-examiner
should be directed to bring out such scientific facts from
the knowledge of the expert as will help his own case,
and thus tend to destroy the weight of the opinion of the
expert given against him.

Another suggestion which should always be borne in
mind is that no question should be put to an expert
which is in any way so broad as to give the expert an
opportunity to expatiate upon his own views, and thus
afford him an opportunity in his answer to give his
reasons, in his own way, for his opinions, which counsel
calling him as an expert might not otherwise have fully
brought out in his examination.

It was in the trial of Dr. Buchanan on the charge of
murdering his wife, that a single, ill-advised question put
upon cross-examination to the physician who had attended
Mrs. Buchanan upon her death-bed, and who had given it
as his opinion that her death was due to natural causes,
which enabled the jury, after twenty-four hours of dispute
among themselves, finally to agree against the prisoner
on a verdict of murder in the first degree, resulting in
Buchanan's execution.

The charge against Dr. Buchanan was that he had
poisoned his wife ---- a woman considerably older than
himself, and who had made a will in his favor ---- with
morphine and atropine, each drug being used in such
proportion as to effectually obliterate the group of symp-
toms attending death when resulting from the use of either
drug alone.

At Buchanan's trial the district attorney found him-
self in the extremely awkward position of trying to per-
suade a jury to decide that Mrs. Buchanan's death was,
beyond all reasonable doubt, the result of an overdose of
morphine mixed with atropine administered by her hus-
band, although a respectable physician, who had attended
her at her death-bed, had given it as his opinion that she
died from natural causes, and had himself made out a
death certificate in which he attributed her death to
apoplexy.

It was only fair to the prisoner that he should be given
the benefit of the testimony of this physician. The Dis-
trict Attorney, therefore, called the doctor to the witness-
stand and questioned him concerning the symptoms he
had observed during his treatment of Mrs. Buchanan just
prior to her death, and developed the fact that the doctor
had made out a death certificate in which he had certified
that in his opinion apoplexy was the sole cause of death.
The doctor was then turned over to the lawyers for the
defence for cross-examination.

One of the prisoner's counsel, who had far more knowl-
edge of medicine than of the art of cross-examination, was
assigned the important duty of cross-examining this wit-
ness. After badgering the doctor for an hour or so with
technical medical questions more or less remote from the
subject under discussion, and tending to show the erudi-
tion of the lawyer who was conducting the examination
rather than to throw light upon the inquiry uppermost in
the minds of the jury, the cross-examiner finally repro-
duced the death certificate and put it in evidence, and
calling the doctor's attention to the statement therein
made --- that death was the result of apoplexy --- ex-
claimed, while flourishing the paper in the air:---

"Now, doctor, you have told us what this lady's symp-
toms were, you have told us what you then believed was
the cause of her death; I now ask you, has anything
transpired since Mrs. Buchanan's death which would
lead you to change your opinion as it is expressed in
this paper?"

The doctor settled back in his chair and slowly re-
peated the question asked: "Has --- anything --- tran-
spired --- since --- Mrs. Buchanan's ---death--- which---
would lead --- me--- to---change---my--- opinion ---as
---it---is---expressed --- in--- this--- paper?" The witness
turned to the judge and inquired if in answer to such
a question he would be allowed to speak of matters
that had come to his knowledge since he wrote the cer-
tificate. The judge replied: "The question is a broad
one. Counsel asks you if you know of _any reason_ why
you should change your former opinion?"

The witness leaned forward to the stenographer and
requested him to read the question over again. This
was done. The attention of everybody in court was by
this time focussed upon the witness, intent upon his
answer. It seemed to appear to the jury as if this must
be the turning point of the case.

The doctor having heard the question read a second
time, paused for a moment, and then straightening him-
self in his chair, turned to the cross-examiner and said,
"I wish to ask _you_ a question, Has the report of the
chemist telling of his discovery of atropine and mor-
phine in the contents of this woman's stomach been
offered in evidence yet?" The court answered, "It
has not."

"One more question," said the doctor, " Has the report
of the pathologist _yet_ been received in evidence?" The
court replied, "No."

"_Then_," said the doctor, rising in his chair, "I can
answer your question truthfully, that as _yet_ in the ab-
sence of the pathological report and in the absence of
the chemical report I know of no legal evidence which
would cause me to alter the opinion expressed in my
death certificate."

It is impossible to exaggerate the impression made
upon the court and jury by these answers. All the
advantage that the prisoner might have derived from
the original death certificate was entirely swept away.

The trial lasted for fully two weeks after this episode.
When the jury retired to their consultation room at the
end of the trial, they found they were utterly unable to
agree upon a verdict. They argued among themselves.
for twenty-four hours without coming to any conclusion.
At the expiration of this time the jury returned to the
court room and asked to have the testimony of this doc-
tor reread to them by the stenographer. The stenog-
rapher, as he read from his notes, reproduced the entire
scene which had been enacted two weeks before. The
jury retired a second time and immediately agreed upon
their verdict of death.

The cross-examinations of the medical witnesses in the
Buchanan case conducted by this same "Medico-legal
Wonder" were the subject of very extended newspaper
praise at the time, one daily paper devoting the entire
front page of its Sunday edition to his portrait.

How expert witnesses have been discredited with juries
in the past, should serve as practical guides for the future.
The whole effect of the testimony of an expert witness
may sometimes effectually be destroyed by putting the
witness to some unexpected and offhand test at the trial,
as to his experience, his ability and discrimination as an
expert, so that in case of his failure to meet the test he
can be held up to ridicule before the jury, and thus the
laughter at his expense will cause the jury to forget any-
thing of weight that he has said against you.

I have always found this to be the most effective
method to cross-examine a certain type of professional
medical witnesses now so frequently seen in our courts.
A striking instance of the efficacy of this style of cross-
examination was experienced by the writer in a damage
suit against the city of New York, tried in the Supreme
Court sometime in 1887.

A very prominent physician, president of one of our
leading clubs at the time, but now dead, had advised a
woman who had been his housekeeper for thirty years,
and who had broken her ankle in consequence of step-
ping into an unprotected hole in the street pavement, to
bring suit against the city to recover $40,000 damages.
There was very little defence to the principal cause of
action: the hole in the street _was_ there, and the plaintiff
had stepped into it; but her right to recover substantial
damages was vigorously contested.

Her principal, in fact her only medical witness was
her employer, the famous physician. The doctor testi-
fied to the plaintiff's sufferings, described the fracture of
her ankle, explained how he had himself set the broken
bones and attended the patient, but affirmed that all his
efforts were of no avail as he could bring about nothing
but a most imperfect union of the bones, and that his
housekeeper, a most respectable and estimable lady,
would be lame for life. His manner on the witness-
stand was exceedingly dignified and frank, and evidently
impressed the jury. A large verdict of fully $15,000
was certain to be the result unless this witness's hold
upon the jury could be broken on his cross-examination.
There was no reason known to counsel why this ankle
should not have healed promptly, as such fractures usu-
ally do; but how to make the jury _realize_ the fact was
the question. The intimate personal acquaintance be-
tween the cross-examiner and the witness was another
embarrassment.

The cross-examination began by showing that the
witness, although a graduate of Harvard, had not im-
mediately entered a medical school, but on the contrary
had started in business in Wall Street, had later been
manager of several business enterprises, and had not
begun the study of medicine until he was forty years
old. The examination then continued in the most
amiable manner possible, each question being asked in
a tone almost of apology.

_Counsel_. "We all know, doctor, that you have a large
and lucrative family practice as a general practitioner;
but is it not a fact that in this great city, where accidents
are of such common occurrence, surgical cases are usu-
ally taken to the hospitals and cared for by experienced
surgeons?"

_Doctor_. "Yes, sir, that is so."

_Counsel_. "You do not even claim to be an experienced
surgeon ?"

_Doctor_. "Oh, no, sir. I have the experience of any
general practitioner."

_Counsel_. “What would be the surgical name for the
particular form of fracture that this lady suffered?"

_Doctor_. What is known as a 'Potts fracture of the
ankle."

_Counsel_. "That is a well-recognized form of fracture,
is it not?"

_Doctor_.
"Oh, yes."

_Counsel_ (chancing it). "Would you mind telling the
jury about when you had a fracture of this nature in
your regular practice, the last before this one?"

_Doctor_ (dodging). "I should not feel at liberty to
disclose the names of my patients."

_Counsel_ (encouraged). “I am not asking for names
and secrets of patients --- far from it. I am only asking
for the date, doctor; but on your oath."

_Doctor_. "I couldn't possibly give you the date, sir.”

_Counsel_ (still feeling his way). "Was it within the
year preceding this one?"

_Doctor_ (hesitating). "I would not like to say, sir."

_Counsel_ (still more encouraged). "I am sorry to press
you, sir; but I am obliged to demand a positive answer
from you whether or not you had had a similar case of
'Potts fracture of the ankle' the year preceding this one?"

_Doctor_. "Well, no, I cannot remember that I had."

_Counsel_. "Did you have one two years before?"

_Doctor_. "I cannot say."

_Counsel_ (forcing the issue). "Did you have one within
five years preceding the plaintiff's case?"

_Doctor_. "I am unable to say positively."

_Counsel_. (appreciating the danger of pressing the in-
quiry further, but as a last resort). "Will you swear that
you _ever_ had a case of 'Potts fracture' within your own
practice before this one? I tell you frankly, if you say
you have, I shall ask you day and date, time, place, and
circumstance."

_Doctor_ (much embarrassed). "Your question is an
embarrassing one. I should want time to search my
memory."

_Counsel_. "I am only asking you for your best memory
as a gentleman, and under oath."

_Doctor_. "If you put it that way, I will say I cannot
now remember of any case previous to the one in ques-
tion, excepting as a student in the hospitals."

_Counsel_. "But does it not require a great deal of
practice and experience to attend successfully so serious
a fracture as that involving the ankle joint?"

_Doctor_. "Oh, yes."

_Counsel_. "Well, doctor, speaking frankly, won't you
admit that 'Potts fractures' are daily being attended to
in our hospitals by experienced men, and the use of the
ankle fully restored in a few months' time?"

_Doctor_. "That may be, but much depends upon the
age of the patient; and again, in some cases, nothing
seems to make the bones unite."

_Counsel_ (stooping under the table and taking up the
two lower bones of the leg attached and approaching
the witness). "Will you please take these, doctor, and
tell the jury whether in life they constituted the bones
of a woman's leg or a man's leg?"

_Doctor_. "It is difficult to tell, sir."

_Counsel_. "What, can't you tell the skeleton of a
woman's leg from a man's, doctor?"

_Doctor_. "Oh, yes,
I should say it was a woman's
leg."

_Counsel_ (smiling and looking pleased).
"So in your
opinion, doctor, this was a woman's leg?" \[It _was_ a
woman's leg.\]

_Doctor_ (observing counsel's face and thinking he had
made a mistake). “Oh, I beg your pardon, it is a man's
leg, of course. I had not examined it carefully."

By this time the jury were all sitting upright in their
seats and evinced much amusement at the doctor's in-
creasing embarrassment.

_Counsel_ (still smiling). "Would you be good enough
to tell the jury if it is the right leg or the left leg?
_Doctor_ (quietly, but hesitatingly). \[It is very difficult
for the inexperienced to distinguish right from left.\]

"This is the _right_ leg."

_Counsel_ (astonished). "_What_ do you say, doctor?"

_Doctor_ (much confused). Pardon me, it is the left
leg."

_Counsel_. "Were you not right the first time, doctor.
Is it not in fact the _right_ leg?"

_Doctor_. "I don't think so; no, it is the _left_ leg."

_Counsel_ (again stooping and bringing from under the
table the bones of the foot attached together, and hand-
ing it to the doctor). "Please put the skeleton of the
foot into the ankle joint of the bones you already have
in your hand, and then tell me whether it is the right or
left leg."

_Doctor_ (confidently). "Yes, it is the left leg, as I said
before."

_Counsel_ (uproariously). "But, doctor, don't you see
you have inserted the _foot_ into the _knee joint_? Is that
the way it is in life?"

The doctor, amid roars of laughter from the jury, in
which the entire court room joined, hastily readjusted
the bones and sat blushing to the roots of his hair.

Counsel waited until the laughter had subsided, and
then said quietly, "I think I will not trouble you
further, doctor."

This incident is not the least bit exaggerated; on the
contrary, the impression made by the occurrence is diffi-
cult to present adequately on paper. Counsel on both
sides proceeded to sum up the case, and upon the part
of the defence no allusion whatsoever was made to the
incident just described. The jury appreciated the fact,
and returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $240. Next
day the learned doctor wrote a four-page letter of thanks
and appreciation that the results of his "stage fright”
had not been spread before the jury in the closing
speech.

As distinguished from the lengthy, though doubtless
scientific, cross-examination of experts in handwriting
with which the profession has become familiar in many
recent famous trials that have occurred in this city, the
following incident cannot fail to serve as a forcible illus-
tration of the suggestions laid down as to the cross-
examination of specialists. It would almost be thought
improbable in a romance, yet every word of it is true.

In the trial of Ellison for felonious assault upon
William Henriques, who had brought Mr. Ellison's
attentions to his daughter, Mrs. Lila Noeme, to a sud-
den close by forbidding him his house, the authenticity
of some letters, alleged to have been written by Mrs.
Noeme to Mr. Ellison, was brought in question. The
lady herself had strenuously denied that the alleged
compromising documents had ever been written by her.

Counsel for Ellison, the late Charles Brooks, Esq., had
evidently framed his whole cross-examination of Mrs.
Noeme upon these letters, and made a final effort to
introduce them in evidence by calling Professor Ames,
the well-known expert in handwriting. He deposed to
having closely studied the letter in question, in con-
junction with an admittedly genuine specimen of the
lady's handwriting, and gave it as his opinion that they
were all written by the same hand. Mr. Brooks then
offered the letters in evidence, and was about to read
them to the jury when the assistant district attorney
asked permission to put a few questions.

_District Attorney_. "Mr. Ames, as I understood you,
you were given only one sample of the lady's genuine
handwriting, and you base your opinion upon that single
exhibit, is that correct?"

_Witness_. "Yes, sir, there was only one letter given me,
but that was quite a long one, and afforded me great
opportunity for comparison."

_District Attorney_. "Would it not assist you if you
were given a number of her letters with which to make
a comparison?"

_Witness_. "Oh, yes, the more samples I had of genu-
ine handwriting, the more valuable my conclusion would
become."

_District Attorney_ (taking from among a bundle of
papers a letter, folding down the signature and handing
it to the witness). "Would you mind taking this one
and comparing it with the others, and then tell us if
that is in the same handwriting?"

_Witness_ (examining paper closely for a few minutes).
"Yes, sir, I should say that was the same handwriting."

_District Attorney_. "Is it not a fact, sir, that the same
individual may write a variety of hands upon different
occasions and with different pens?"

_Witness_. "Oh, yes, sir; they might vary somewhat."

_District Attorney_ (taking a second letter from his files,
also folding over the signature and handing to the wit-
ness). "Won't you kindly take this letter, also, and com-
pare it with the others you have?”

_Witness_ (examining the letter).
“Yes, sir, that is a
variety of the same penmanship."

_District Attorney_. “Would you be willing to give it
as your opinion that it was written by the same person?"

_Witness_. "I certainly would, sir."

_District Attorney_ (taking a third letter from his files,
again folding over the signature, and handing to the wit-
ness). "Be good enough to take just one more sample
--- I don't want to weary you---
and say if this last one
is also in the lady's handwriting.”

_Witness_ (appearing to examine it closely, leaving the
witness-chair and going to the window to complete his
inspection). "Yes, sir; you understand I am not swear-
ing to a fact, only an opinion."

_District Attorney_ (good-naturedly). "Of course I
understand; but is it your honest opinion as an ex-
pert, that these three letters are all in the same hand-
writing?"

_Witness_. "I say yes, it is my honest opinion."

_District Attorney_. "Now, sir, won't you please turn
down the edge where I folded over the signature to the
first letter I handed you, and read aloud to the jury the
signature?"

_Witness_ (unfolding the letter and reading trium-
phantly). "_Lila Naome_."

_District Attorney_. "Please unfold the second letter
and read the signature."

_Witness_ (reading). "_William Henriques_."

_District Attorney_. "Now the third, please."

_Witness_ (hesitating and reading with much embarrass-
ment). "_Frank Ellison_ !"89/1

The alleged compromising letters were never read to
the jury.

It will not be uninteresting, by way of contrast, I
think, to record here another instance where the cross-
examination of an expert in handwriting did more to
convict a prisoner, probably, than any other one piece of
evidence during the entire trial.

The examination referred to occurred in the famous
trial of Munroe Edwards, who was indicted for forg-
ing two drafts upon Messrs. Brown Brothers & Com-
pany, who had offered a reward of $20,000 for his
arrest.

Munroe had engaged Mr. Robert Emmet to defend
him, and had associated with Emmet as his counsel
Mr. William M. Evarts and several famous lawyers from
without the state. At that time the district attorney
was Mr. James R. Whiting, who had four prominent
lawyers, including Mr. Ogden Hoffman, associated with
him upon the side of the government.

89/1 As a matter of fact, father and daughter wrote very much alike, and with
surprising similarity to Mr. Ellison. It was this circumstance that led to the
use of the three letters in the cross-examination.

Recorder Vaux, of Philadelphia, was called to the
witness-stand as an expert in handwriting, and in his
direct testimony had very clearly identified the prisoner
with the commission of the particular forgery for which
he was on trial. He was then turned over to Mr. Emmet
for cross-examination.

_Mr. Emmet_ (taking a letter from among his papers
and handing it to the witness, after turning down the
signature). “Would you be good enough to tell me,  Mr. Vaux, who was the author of the letter which I now
hand you?"

_Mr. Vaux_ (answering promptly). "This letter is in
the handwriting of Munroe Edwards."

_Mr. Emmet_. "Do you feel certain of that, Mr. Vaux?"

_Mr. Vaux_. "I do."

_Mr. Emmet_. "As certain as you are in relation to
the handwriting of the letters which you have previously
identified as having been written by the prisoner?"

_Mr. Vaux_. "Exactly the same."

_Mr. Emmet_. "You have no hesitation then in swear-
ing positively that the letter you hold in your hand, in
your opinion, was written by Munroe Edwards?"

_Mr. Vaux_. "Not the slightest."

_Mr. Emmet_ (with a sneer). "That will do, sir."

_District Attorney_ (rising quickly). "Let me see the
letter."

_Mr. Emmet_
(contemptuously).
"That is your privi-
lege, sir, but I doubt if it will be to your profit. The
letter is directed to myself, and is written by the cashier
of the Orleans bank, informing me of a sum of money
deposited in that institution to the credit of the prisoner.
Mr. Vaux's evidence in relation to it will test the value
of his testimony in relation to other equally important
points."

Mr. Vaux here left the witness chair and walked to
the table of the prosecution, reëxamined the letter care-
fully, then reached to a tin box which was in the keeping
of the prosecution and which contained New Orleans
post-office stamps. He then resumed his seat in the
witness chair.

_Mr. Vaux_ (smiling). “I may be willing, Mr. Emmet,
to submit my testimony to your test."

Mr. Emmet made no reply, but the prosecuting
attorney continued the examination as follows:---

_District Attorney_. "You have just testified, Mr. Vaux,
that you believe the letter which you now hold in your
hand was written by the same hand that wrote the
Caldwell forgeries, and that such hand was Munroe
Edwards's. Do you still retain that opinion?"

_Mr. Vaux_. "I do."

_District Attorney_. "Upon what grounds?"

_Mr. Vaux_. "Because it is a fellow of the same char-
acter as well in appearance as in device. It is a forgery,
probably only intended to impose upon his counsel, but
now by its unadvised introduction in evidence, made to
impose upon himself and brand him as a forger."

The true New Orleans stamps were here shown to
be at variance with the counterfeit postmark upon the
forged letter, and the character of the writing was also
proved by comparison with many letters which were in
the forger's undoubted hand.

It turned out subsequently that the prisoner had
informed his counsel, Mr. Emmet, that he was possessed
of large amounts of property in Texas, some of which he
had ordered to be sold to meet the contingent cost of
his defence. He had drawn up a letter purporting
come from a cashier in a bank at New Orleans, directed
to Mr. Emmet, informing him of the deposit on that
day of $1500 to the credit of his client, which notifica-
tion he, the cashier, thought proper to send to the
counsel, as he had observed in the newspapers that Mr.
Edwards was confined to the jail. Mr. Emmet was so
entirely deceived by this letter that he had taken it to
his client in prison, and had shown it to him as a sign
of pleasant tidings.92/1

The manufacture or exaggeration of injuries, in dam-
age cases against surface railroads and other corpora-
tions, had at one time, not many years ago, become
almost a trade among a certain class of lawyers in the
city of New York.

There are several medical books which detail the
symptoms that may be expected to be exhibited in almost
any form of railroad accidents. Any lawyer who is
familiar with the pages of these books can readily detect
indications of an equal familiarity with them on the part
of the lawyer who is examining his client ---the plaintiff
in an accident case---as to the _symptoms_ of his malady
as set forth in these medical treatises, which have prob-
ably been put into his hands in order that he may
become thoroughly posted upon the symptoms which
he would be expected to manifest.

92/1 " Pleasantries about Courts and Lawyers," Edwards.


It becomes interesting to watch the history of some of
these cases after the substantial amount of the verdict
awarded by a jury has been paid over to the suffering
plaintiff. Only last winter a couple of medical gentlemen
were called as witnesses in a case where a Mrs. Bogardus
was suing the Metropolitan Street Railway Company for
injuries she claimed to have sustained while a passenger
on one of the defendant's cars. These expert physicians
swore that Mrs. Bogardus had a lesion of the spine and
was suffering from paralysis as a result of the accident.
According to the testimony of the doctors, her malady
was incurable and permanent. The records of the legal
department of this railway company showed that these
same medical gentlemen had, on a prior occasion in the
case of a Mr. Hoyt against the railroad, testified to the
same state of affairs in regard to Mr. Hoyt's physical
condition. He, too, was alleged to be suffering from an
incurable lesion of the spine and would be paralyzed and
helpless for the balance of his life. The records of the
company also showed that Hoyt had recovered his health
promptly upon being paid the amount of his verdict. At
the time of the Bogardus trial Hoyt had been employed
by H. B. Claflin & Co. for three years. He was working
from seven in the morning until six in the evening, lift-
ing heavy boxes and loading trucks.

The moment the physicians had finished their testi-
mony in the Bogardus case, this man Hoyt was sub-
pœnaed by the railroad company. On cross-examina-
tion these physicians both recollected the Hoyt case and
their attention was called to the stenographic minutes of
the questions and answers they had given under oath in
that case. They were then asked if Hoyt was still alive
and where he could be found. They both replied that
he must be dead by this time, that his case was a hope-
less one, and if not dead, he would probably be found as
an inmate of one of our public insane asylums.

At this stage of the proceedings Hoyt arrived in the
court room. He was requested to step forward in front
of the jury. The doctors were asked to identify him,
which they both did. Hoyt then took the witness-stand
himself and admitted that he had never had a sick mo-
ment since the day the jury rendered a verdict in his
favor; that he had gained thirty-five pounds in weight,
and that he was then doing work which was harder than
any he had ever done before in his life; that he worked
from early morning till late at night; had never been in
an insane asylum or under the care of any doctor since
his trial; and ended up by making the astounding state-
ment that out of the verdict rendered him by the jury
and paid by the railroad company, _he had been obliged
to forfeit upwards of $1500 to the doctors who had
treated him and testified in his behalf_.

This was a little too much enlightenment for the jury
in Mrs. Bogardus's case, and this time they rendered their
verdict promptly in favor of the railroad company.

I cannot forbear relating in this connection another
most striking instance of the unreliability of expert testi-
mony in personal injury cases. This is especially the
case with certain New York physicians who openly con-
fess it to be a part of their professional business to give
expert medical testimony in court. Some of these men
have taken a course at a law school in connection with
their medical studies for the very purpose of fitting
themselves for the witness-stand as medical experts.

One of these gentlemen gave testimony in a case
which was tried only last November, which should
forever brand him as a dangerous witness in any
subsequent litigation in which he may appear. I have
reference to the trial of Ellen McQuade against the Met-
ropolitan Street Railway Company. This was a suit
brought on behalf of the next of kin, to recover damages
for the death of John McQuade who had fallen from a
surface railway car and had broken his wrist so that the
bone penetrated the skin. This wound was slow in
healing and did not close entirely until some three
months later. About six months after his accident Mc-
Quade was suddenly taken ill and died. An autopsy
disclosed the fact that death resulted from inflammation
of the brain, and the effort of the expert testimony in the
case was to connect this abscess of the brain with the
accident to the wrist, which had occurred six months
previously.

This expert doctor had, of course, never seen McQuade
in his lifetime, and knew nothing about the case except
what was contained in the hypothetical question which
he was called upon to answer. He gave it as his opinion
that the broken wrist was the direct cause of the abscess
in the brain, which in turn was due to a pus germ that
had travelled from the wound in the arm by means of
the lymphatics up to the brain, where it had found lodg-
ment and developed into an abscess of the brain, causing
death.

The contention of the railway company was that the
diseased condition of the brain was due to "middle-
ear disease," which itself was the result of a cold or
exposure, and in nowise connected with the accident;
and that the presence of the large amount of fluid which
was found in the brain after death could be accounted
for only by this disease.

During the cross-examination of this medical expert, a
young woman, wearing a veil, had come into court and
was requested to step forward and lift her veil. The doc
tor was then asked to identify her as a Miss Zimmer,
for whom he had testified some years previously in her
damage suit against the same railway company.

At her own trial Miss Zimmer had been carried into
the court room resting in a reclining chair, apparently
unable to move her lower limbs, and this doctor had
testified that she was suffering from chronic myelitis,
an affection of the spine, which caused her to be para-
lyzed, and that she would never be able to move her
lower limbs. His oracular words to the jury were, “ Just
as she is now, gentlemen, so she will always be." The
witness's attention was called to these statements, and he
was confronted with Miss Zimmer, now apparently in the
full vigor of her health, and who had for many years
been acting as a trained nurse. She afterward took the
witness-stand and admitted that the jury had found
a verdict for her in the sum of $15,000, but that her
paralysis had so much improved after the administration
of this panacea by the railway company that she was able,
after a few months, to get about with the aid of crutches,
and shortly thereafter regained the normal use of her
limbs, and had ever since earned her livelihood as an
obstetrical nurse.

The sensation caused by the appearance of the
Zimmer woman had hardly subsided when the wit-
ness's attention was drawn to another case, Kelly against
the railway company, in which this doctor had also
assisted the plaintiff. Kelly was really paralyzed, but
claimed that his paralysis was due to a recent railroad
accident. It appeared during the trial, however, that
long before the alleged railroad accident, Kelly had lost
the use of his limbs, and that his case had become so
notorious as to be a subject for public lectures by many
reputable city physicians. The doctor was obliged to
admit being a witness in that case also, but disclaimed
any intentional assistance in the fraud.

One of the greatest vices of expert medical testimony
is the _hypothetical_ question and answer which has come
to play so important a part in our trials nowadays. It
is, perhaps, the most abominable form of evidence that
was ever allowed to choke the mind of a juror or throttle
his intelligence.

An hypothetical question is supposed to be an accu-
rate synopsis of the testimony that has already been
sworn to by the various witnesses who have preceded
the appearance of the medical expert in the case. The
doctor is then asked to assume the truth of every fact
which counsel has included in his question, and to give
the jury his opinion and conclusions as an expert from
these supposed facts.

It frequently happens that the physician has never even
seen, much less examined, the patient concerning whose
condition he is giving sworn testimony. Nine times
out of ten the jury take the answer of the witness as
direct evidence of the existence of the fact itself. It is
the duty of the cross-examiner to enlighten the jury
in regard to such questions and make them realize that
it is not usually the truth of the _answer_, but the truth
and accuracy of the _question_ which requires their con-
sideration. These hypothetical questions are usually
loosely and inaccurately framed and present a very
different aspect of the case from that which the testi-
mony of the witnesses would justify. If, however, the
question is substantially correct, it is allowed to be put
to the witness; the damaging answer follows, and the
jury conclude that the plaintiff is certainly suffering
from the dreadful or incurable malady the doctor has
apparently sworn to.

A clever cross-examiner is frequently able to shatter
the injurious effect of such hypothetical questions. One
useful method is to rise and demand of the physician
that he repeat, in substance, the question that had just
been put to him and upon which he bases his answer.
The stumbling effort of the witness to recall the various
stages of the question (such questions are usually very
long) opens the eyes of the jury at once to the dangers
of such testimony. It is not always safe, however, to
make this inquiry. It all depends upon the character
of witness you are examining. Some doctors, before
being sworn as witnesses, study carefully the typewrit-
ten hypothetical questions which they are to answer.
A single inquiry will easily develop this phase of the
matter, and if the witness answers that he has previously
read the question, it is often usual to ask him which
particular part of it he lays the most stress upon, and
which parts he could throw out altogether. Thus one
may gradually narrow him down to some particular
factor in the hypothetical question, the truth of which
the previous testimony in the case might have left in
considerable doubt.

It will often turn out that a single sentence or twist
in the question serves as a foundation for the entire
answer of the witness. This is especially the case with
conscientious physicians, who often suggest to counsel
the addition of a few words which will enable them to
answer the entire question as desired. The development
of this fact alone will do much to destroy the witness
with the jury. I discovered once, upon cross-examining
one of our most eminent physicians, that he had
added the words, “Can you say _with positiveness_,” to a
lawyer's hypothetical question, and then had taken the
stand and answered the question in the negative,
although had he been asked for his honest _opinion_ on
the subject, he would have been obliged to have given a
different answer.

Hypothetical questions put in behalf of a plaintiff
would not of course include facts which might develop
later for the defence. When cross-examining to such
questions, therefore, it is often useful to inquire in what
respect the witness would modify his answer if he were
to assume the truth of these new factors in the case.
Supposing that in addition to the matters you have
already considered, there were to be added the facts that
I will now give you," etc., "what would your opinion be
then?" etc.

Frequently hypothetical questions are so framed that
they answer themselves by begging the question. In the
Guiteau case all the medical experts were asked in effect,
though not in form, to assume that a man having an
hereditary taint of insanity, exhibits his _insanity_ in his
youth, exhibits it in his manhood, and at a subsequent
date, being under the _insane delusion_ that he was
authorized and commanded by God to kill the President
of the United States, proceeded _without cause_ to kill
him; and upon these assumptions the experts were asked
to give their opinion whether such a man was sane or
insane.

To pick out the flaws in most hypothetical questions;
to single out the particular sentence, adjective, or adverb
upon which the physician is centring his attention as
he takes his oath, requires no little experience and
astuteness.

The professional witness is always partisan, ready and
even eager to serve the party calling him. This fact
should be ever present in the mind of the cross-examiner.
Encourage the witness to betray his partisanship; encour-
age him to volunteer statements and opinions, and to give
irresponsive answers. Jurors always look with suspicion
upon such testimony.
Assume that an expert witness
called against you has come prepared to do you all the
harm he can, and will avail himself of every opportunity
to do so which you may inadvertently give him. Such
witnesses are usually shrewd and cunning men, and come
into court prepared on the subject concerning which they
are to testify.

Some experts, however, are mere shams and pretenders.
I remember witnessing some years ago the utter collapse
of one of these expert pretenders of the medical type. It
was in a damage suit against the city. The plaintiff's
doctor was a loquacious gentleman of considerable per-
sonal presence. He testified to a serious head injury, and
proceeded to "lecture " the jury on the subject in a sensa-
tional and oracular manner which evidently made a great
impression upon the jury. Even the judge seemed to
give more than the usual attention. The doctor talked
glibly about "vasomotor nerves and "reflexes" and
expressed himself almost entirely in medical terms which
the jury did not understand. He polished off his testi-
mony with the prediction that the plaintiff could never
recover, and if he lived at all, it would necessarily be
within the precincts of an insane asylum. Counsel
representing the city saw at a glance that this was no
ordinary type of witness. Any cross-examination on the
medical side of the case would be sure to fail; for the
witness, though evidently dishonest, was yet ingenious
enough to cover his tracks by the cuttle-fish expedient
of befogging his answers in a cloud of medical terms.
Dr. Allan McLane Hamilton, who was present as
medical adviser in behalf of the city, suggested the
following expedient:---

_Counsel_. Doctor, I infer from the number of books
that you have brought here to substantiate your position,
and from your manner of testifying, that you are very
familiar with the literature of your profession, and espe-
cially that part relating to head injury."

_Doctor_. "I pride myself that I am --- I have not only
a large private library, but have spent many months in
the libraries of Vienna, Berlin, Paris, and London."

_Counsel_. "Then perhaps you are acquainted with
Andrews's celebrated work 'On the Recent and Remote
Effects of Head Injury'?"

_Doctor_ (smiling superciliously). "Well, I should say
I was. I had occasion to consult it only last week."

_Counsel_. "Have you ever come across Charvais on
Cerebral Trauma'?”

_Doctor_. "Yes, I have read Dr. Charvais's book from
cover to cover many times."

Counsel continued in much the same strain, putting
to the witness similar questions relating to many other
fictitious medical works, all of which the doctor had
either “studied carefully” or “had in his library about to
read,” until finally, suspecting that the doctor was be-
coming conscious of the trap into which he was being
led, the counsel suddenly changed his tactics and de-
manded in a loud sneering tone if the doctor had ever
read Page on Injuries of the Spine and Spinal Cord"
(a genuine and most learned treatise on the subject). To
this inquiry the doctor laughingly replied, "I never
heard of any such book and I guess you never did
either!"

The climax had been reached. Dr. Hamilton was im-
mediately sworn for the defence and explained to the
jury his participation in preparing the list of bogus
medical works with which the learned expert for the
plaintiff had shown such familiarity!

On the other hand, when the cross-examiner has totally
failed to shake the testimony of an able and honest ex-
pert, he should be very wary of attempting to discredit
him by any slurring allusions to his professional ability,
as is well illustrated by the following example of the
danger of giving the expert a good chance for a retort.

Dr. Joseph Collins, a well-known nerve specialist, was
giving testimony last winter on the side of the Metro-
politan Street Railway in a case where the plaintiff
claimed to be suffering from a misplaced kidney which
the railroad doctor's examination failed to disclose.
Having made nothing out of the cross-examination of
Dr. Collins, the plaintiff's lawyer threw this parting
boomerang at the witness:---

_Counsel_. After all, doctor, isn't it a fact that nobody
in your profession regards you as a surgeon?"

_Doctor_. “I never regarded myself as one."

_Counsel_. "You are a neurologist, aren't you, doctor?"

_Doctor_. "I am, sir."

_Counsel_. "A neurologist, pure and simple?"

_Doctor_. "Well, I am moderately pure and altogether
simple."

Aside from the suggestions already made as to the best
methods of cross-examining experts, no safe general rules
can be laid down for the successful cross-examination of
expert alienists, but a most happy illustration of one ex-
cellent method which may be adopted with a certain type
of alienist was afforded by the cross-examination in the
following proceedings:---

In the summer of 1898 habeas corpus proceedings were
instituted in New York to obtain the custody of a child.
The question of the father's sanity or insanity at the
time he executed a certain deed of guardianship was the
issue in the trial.

A well-known alienist, who for the past ten years has
appeared in the New York courts upon one side or the
other in pretty nearly every important case involving the
question of insanity, was retained by the petitioner to sit
in court during the trial and observe the actions, de-
meanor, and testimony of the father, the alleged lunatic,
while he was giving his evidence upon the witness-stand.

At the close of the father's testimony this expert wit-
ness was himself called upon to testify as to the result of
his observation, and was interrogated as follows:---

_Counsel_. "Were you present in court yesterday when
the defendant in the present case was examined as a
witness?"

_Witness_. "I was."

_Counsel_. "Did you see him about the court room
before he took the witness-stand?"

_Witness_. "I observed him in this court room and on
the witness-stand on Monday."

_Counsel_. “You were sitting at the table here during
the entire session?"

_Witness_. “I was sitting at the table during his exami-
nation."

_Counsel_. "You heard all his testimony?"

_Witness_. "I did."

_Counsel_. "Did you observe his manner and behavior
while giving his testimony?"

_Witness_. "I did."

_Counsel_. "Closely?"

_Witness_. "Very closely."

Upon being shown certain specimens of the hand-
writing of the defendant, the examination proceeded as
follows:---

_Counsel_. "Now, Doctor, assuming that the addresses
on these envelopes were written by the defendant some
three or more years ago, and that the other addresses
shown you and the signatures attached thereto were
written by him within this last year, and taking into con-
sideration at the same time the defendant's manner upon
the witness-stand, as you observed it, and his entire
deportment while under examination, did you form an
opinion as to his present mental condition?"

_Witness_. "I formed an estimate of his mental condi-
tion from my observation of him in the court room and
while he was giving his testimony and from an examina-
tion of these specimens of handwriting taken in connec-
tion with my observation of the man himself."

_Counsel_. "What in your opinion was his mental con-
dition at the time he gave his testimony?"

_The Court_. "I think, Doctor, that before you answer
that question, it would be well for you to tell us what you
observed upon which you based your opinion."

_Witness_. "It appeared to me that upon the witness-
stand the defendant exhibited a _slowness and hesitancy_
in giving answers to perfectly distinct and easily compre-
hensible questions, which was not consistent with a sound
mental condition of a person of his education and station
in life. I noted a _forgetfulness_, particularly of recent
events. I noted also an expression of face which was
peculiarly characteristic of a certain form of mental
disease; an expression of, I won't say hilarity, but a
_fatuous, transitory smile_, and exhibited upon occasions
which did not call in my opinion for any such facial
expression, and which to alienists possesses a peculiar
significance. As regards these specimens of handwrit-
ing which I have been shown, particularly the _signature_
to the deed, it appears to me _to be tremulous_ and to show
a want of coördinating power over the muscles which
were used in making that signature."

In answer to a hypothetical question describing the
history of the defendant's life as claimed by the peti-
tioner, the witness replied:---

_Witness_. "My opinion is that the person described
in the hypothetical question is suffering from a form of
insanity known as paresis, in the stage of dementia."

Upon the adjournment of the day's session of the
court, the witness was requested to take the deed (the
signature to which was the writing which he had de-
scribed as "tremulous" and on which he had based his
opinion of dementia) and to read it carefully over night.
The following morning this witness resumed the stand
and gave it as his opinion that the defendant was in
such condition of mind that he could not comprehend
the full purpose and effect of that paper.

The doctor was here turned over to defendant's coun-
sel for cross-examination. Counsel jumped to his feet and,
taking the witness off his guard, rather gruffly shouted:---

_Counsel_. "In your opinion, what were you employed
to come here for?"

_Witness_ (after hesitating a considerable time). “I
was employed to come here to listen to the testimony
of this defendant, the father of this child whose guard-
ianship is under dispute."

_Counsel_. "Was that a simple question that I put to
you? Did you consider it simple?"

_Witness_. "A perfectly simple question."

_Counsel_ (smiling). "Why were you so _slow_ about
answering it then?"

_Witness_. "I always answer deliberately; it is my habit."

_Counsel_. "Would that be an evidence of derangement
in _your_ mental faculties, Doctor--- the slowness with
which you answer?"

_Witness_. “I am making an effort to answer your
questions correctly."

_Counsel_. "But perhaps the defendant was making an
effort to answer questions correctly the other day?"

_Witness_. "He was undoubtedly endeavoring to do so."

_Counsel_. "You came here for the avowed purpose
of watching the defendant, didn't you?"

_Witness_. "I came here for the purpose of giving an
opinion upon his mental condition."

_Counsel_. "Did you intend to listen to his testimony
before forming any opinion?"

_Witness_. "I did."

_Counsel_ (now smiling). "One of the things that you
stated as indicating the disease of paresis was the defend-
ant's _slowness_ in answering simple questions, wasn't it?"

_Witness_. "It was."

***

_Counsel_. "Now, in forming your opinion, you based
it in part on his handwriting, did you not?"

_Witness_. “I did, as I testified yesterday."

_Counsel_. And for that purpose you selected one sig-
nature to a particular instrument and threw out of con-
sideration certain envelopes which were handed to you;
is that right?"

_Witness_. "I examined a number of signatures, but
there was only one which showed the characteristic
tremor of paresis, and that was the signature to the
instrument."

The witness was here shown various letters and writ-
ings of the defendant executed at a later date than the
deed of guardianship.

_Counsel_. "Now, Doctor, what have you to say to
these later writings?"

_Witness_. "They are specimens of good handwriting.
If you wish to draw it out, they do not indicate any
disease---paresis or any other disease."

_Counsel_. "Do you think there has been an improve-
ment in the defendant's condition meanwhile?"

_Witness_. "I don't know. There is certainly a great
improvement in his handwriting."

_Counsel_. "It would appear, then, Doctor, that you
selected from a large mass of papers and letters _only
one_ which showed nervous trouble, and do you pre-
tend to say that you consider that as fair?"

_Witness_. "I do, because I looked for the one that
showed the most nervous trouble, although it is true
I found only one."

_Counsel_. "How many specimens of handwriting were
submitted to you from which you made this selection?"

_Witness_. "Some fifteen or twenty."

_Counsel_. "Doctor, you are getting a little slow in
your answers again."

_Witness_. "I have a right; my answers go on the
record. I have a right to make them as exact and
careful as I please."

_Counsel_ (sternly). "The defendant was testifying for
his liberty and the custody of his child; he had a right
to be a little careful; don't you think he had?"

_Witness_. "Undoubtedly."

_Counsel_. "You also expressed the opinion that the
defendant could not understand or comprehend the
meaning of the deed of guardianship that has been put
in your hands for examination over night?"

_Witness_. "That is my opinion."

_Counsel_. "What do you understand to be the effect
of this paper?"

_Witness_. "The effect of that paper is to appoint, for
a formal legal consideration, Mrs. Blank as the guardian
of defendant's daughter and to empower her and to
give her all of the rights and privileges which such
guardianship involves, and Mrs. Blank agrees on her
part to defend all suits for wrongful detention as if it
were done by the defendant himself, and the defendant
empowers her to act for him as if it were by himself
in that capacity. That is my recollection."

_Counsel_. "What that paper really accomplishes is to
transfer the management and care and guardianship of
the child to Mrs. Blank, isn't it?"

_Witness_. "I don't know. I am speaking only as to
what bears on his mental condition."

_Counsel_. "Do you know whether that is what the
paper accomplishes?”

_Witness_. "I have given you my recollection as well
as I can. I read the paper over once."

_Counsel_. "I am asking you what meaning it conveyed
to your mind, because I am going to give the defendant
the distinguished honor of contrasting his mind with
yours."

_Witness_. "I should be very glad to be found inferior
to his; I wish he were different."

_Counsel_. "When the defendant testified about that
paper, he was asked the same question that you were
asked, and he said, 'I know it was simply a paper
supposed to give Mrs. Blank the management and care
of my child.' Don't you think that was a pretty good
recollection of the contents of the paper for a man
in the state of dementia that you have described?"

_Witness_. "Very good."

_Counsel_. "Rather remarkable, wasn't it?"

_Witness_. "It was correct interpretation of the
paper.”

_Counsel_. "If he could give that statement on the
witness-stand in answer to hostile counsel, do you mean
to say that he couldn't comprehend the meaning of the
paper?"

_Witness_."He was very uncertain, hesitating, if I
recollect it, about that statement. He got it correct,
that's true."

_Counsel_. "Then it was the manner of his statement
and not the substance that you are dealing with; is that
it?"

_Witness_. "He stated that his recollection was not
good and he didn't quite recollect what it was, but
subsequently he made that statement."

_Counsel_. "Don't you think it was remarkable for him
to have been able to recollect from the seventh day of
June the one great fact concerning this paper, to wit:
that he had given the care and maintenance of his
daughter to Mrs. Blank?"

_Witness_. "He did recollect it."

_Counsel_. "It is a pretty good recollection for a
dement, isn't it?"

_Witness_. "He recollected it."

_Counsel_. "Is that a good recollection for a dement?"

_Witness_. "It is."

_Counsel_. "Isn't it a good recollection for a man who
is not a dement?"

_Witness_. “He recollected it perfectly."

_Counsel_. "Don't you understand, Doctor, that the
man who can describe a paper in one sentence is con-
sidered to have a better mind than he who takes half a
dozen sentences to describe it?"

_Witness_. "A great deal better mind."

_Counsel_. "Then the defendant rather out-distanced
you in describing that paper?"

_Witness_. "He was very succinct and accurate."

_Counsel_. "And that is in favor of his mind as against
yours?"

_Witness_. "As far as that goes."

_Counsel_. "Now we will take up the next subject, and
see if I cannot bring the defendant's mind up to your
level in that particular. The next thing you noticed,
you say, was the slowness and hesitancy with which he
gave his answers to perfectly distinct and easily com-
prehended questions?"

_Witness_. "That is correct."

_Counsel_. “But you have shown the same slowness
and hesitancy to-day, haven't you?"

_Witness_. "I have shown no hesitancy; I have been
deliberate."

_Counsel_. "What is your idea of the difference be-
tween hesitancy and deliberation, Doctor?"

_Witness_. "Hesitancy is what I am suffering from
now; I hesitate in finding an answer to that question."

_Counsel_. "You admit there is hesitation; isn't that
so?"

_Witness_. "And slowness is slowness."

_Counsel_. "Then we have got them both from you
now. You are both slow and you hesitate, on your own
statement; is that so, Doctor?"

_Witness_. "Yes.”

_Counsel_. "So the defendant and you are quits again
on that; is that right?"

_Witness_. “I admit no slowness and hesitancy. I am
giving answers to your questions as carefully and accu-
rately and frankly and promptly as I can."

_Counsel_. "Wasn't the defendant doing that?"

_Witness_. "I presume he was."

_Counsel_. "What was the next thing that you
observed besides his slowness and hesitancy, do you
remember?"

_Witness_. "You will have to refresh my memory."

_Counsel_ (quoting). "I noted a forgetfulness, par-
ticularly of recent events.' You think the defendant
is even with you now, on forgetfulness, don't you?"

_Witness_. "It looks that way."

_Counsel_. "You say further, 'I noted an expression
of face which was peculiarly characteristic of a cer-
tain form of mental disease; I noticed particularly an
expression of, I won't say hilarity, but a fatuous, transi-
tory smile, on occasions which did not call, in my
opinion, for any such facial expression.' Would you
think it was extraordinary that there should be a
supercilious smile on the face of a sane man under some
circumstances?"

_Witness_. "I should think it would be very extraor-
dinary."

_Counsel_. "Doctor, he might have had in mind the
fact of the little talk you and I were to have this after-
noon. That might have brought a smile to his face;
don't you
think so?"

_Witness_. "I do not."

_Counsel_. "If as he sat there he had any idea of what
I would ask you and what your testimony would be,
don't you think he was justified in having an ironical
expression upon his face?”

_Witness_. "Perhaps."

_Counsel_. "It comes to this, then, you selected only
one specimen of tremulous handwriting?"

_Witness_. "I said so."

_Counsel_. "You yourself have shown slowness in an-
swering my questions?"

_Witness_. "Sometimes."

_Counsel_. "And forgetfulness?"

_Witness_.
"You said so."

_Counsel_. "And you admit that any sane man listen-
ing to you would be justified in having an ironical smile
on his face?"

_Witness_. (No answer.)

_Counsel_. "You also admitted that the man you claim
to be insane, gave from memory a better idea of the con-
tents of this legal paper than you did, although you had
examined and studied it over night?"

_Witness_. "Perhaps."

_Counsel_ (condescendingly). "You didn't exactly mean
then that the defendant was actually deprived of his
mind?"

_Witness_. "No, he is not deprived of his mind, and I
never intended to convey any such idea."

_Counsel_. "Then, after all, your answers mean only that
the defendant has not got as much mind as some other
people; is that it?"

_Witness_. "Well, my answers mean that he has pare-
sis with mental deterioration, and, if you wish me to say
so, not as much mind as some other people; there are
some people who have more and some who have less."

_Counsel_. "He has enough mind to escape an expres-
sion which would indicate the entire deprivation of the
mental faculties?"

_Witness_. "Yes."

_Counsel_. "He has enough mind to write the letters of
which you have spoken in the highest terms?"

_Witness_. "I have said they were good letters."

_Counsel_. "He has enough mind to accurately and
logically describe this instrument, the deed of guardian-
ship, which he executed?"

_Witness_. "As I have described."

_Counsel_. "He probably knows more about his domestic
affairs than you do. That is a fair presumption, isn't it?"

_Witness_. “I know nothing about them."

_Counsel_. "For all that you know he may have had ex-
cellent reasons for taking the very course he has taken
in this case?"

_Witness_. "That is not impossible; it is none of my
affair."
