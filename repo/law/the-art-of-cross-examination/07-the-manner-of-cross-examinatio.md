## THE MANNER OF CROSS-EXAMINATION

It needs but the simple statement of the nature of
cross-examination to demonstrate its indispensable char-
acter in all trials of questions of fact. No cause reaches
the stage of litigation unless there are two sides to it.
If the witnesses on one side deny or qualify the state-
ments made by those on the other, which side is telling
the truth? Not necessarily which side is offering per-
jured testimony, --- there is far less intentional perjury in
the courts than the inexperienced would believe, --- but
which side is honestly mistaken? --- for, on the other
hand, evidence itself is far less trustworthy than the
public usually realizes. The opinions of which side are
warped by prejudice or blinded by ignorance? Which
side has had the power or opportunity of correct observa-
tion? How shall we tell, how make it apparent to a jury
of disinterested men who are to decide between the liti-
gants? Obviously, by the means of cross-examination.

If all witnesses had the honesty and intelligence to
come forward and scrupulously follow the letter as well
as the spirit of the oath, “to tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth,” and if all advocates on
either side had the necessary experience, combined with
honesty and intelligence, and were similarly sworn to
_develop_ the whole truth and nothing but the truth, of
course there would be no occasion for cross-examination,
and the occupation of the cross-examiner would be gone.
But as yet no substitute has ever been found for cross-
examination as a means of separating truth from false-
hood, and of reducing exaggerated statements to their
true dimensions.

The system is as old as the history of nations. In-
deed, to this day, the account given by Plato of Socrates's
cross-examination of his accuser, Miletus, while defending
himself against the capital charge of corrupting the youth
of Athens, may be quoted as a masterpiece in the art of
cross-questioning.

Cross-examination is generally considered to be the
most difficult branch of the multifarious duties of the
advocate. Success in the art, as some one has said,
comes more often to the happy possessor of a genius
for it. Great lawyers have often failed lamentably in
it, while marvellous success has crowned the efforts of
those who might otherwise have been regarded as of a
mediocre grade in the profession. Yet personal expe-
rience and the emulation of others trained in the art,
are the surest means of obtaining proficiency in this
all-important prerequisite of a competent trial lawyer.

It requires the greatest ingenuity; a habit of logical
thought; clearness of perception in general; infinite
patience and self-control; power to read men's minds
intuitively, to judge of their characters by their faces, to
appreciate their motives; ability to act with force and
precision; a masterful knowledge of the subject-matter
itself; an extreme caution; and, above all, the _instinct to
discover the weak point_ in the witness under examina-
tion.

One has to deal with a prodigious variety of witnesses
testifying under an infinite number of differing circum-
stances. It involves all shades and complexions of
human morals, human passions, and human intelligence.
It is a mental duel between counsel and witness.

In discussing the methods to employ when cross-
examining a witness, let us imagine ourselves at work in
the trial of a cause, and at the close of the direct exami-
nation of a witness called by our adversary. The first
inquiry would naturally be, Has the witness testified to
anything that is material against us? Has his testimony
injured our side of the case? Has he made an impres-
sion with the jury against us? Is it necessary for us to
cross-examine him at all?

Before dismissing a witness, however, the possibility
of being able to elicit some new facts in our own favor
should be taken into consideration. If the witness is
apparently truthful and candid, this can be readily done
by asking plain, straightforward questions. If, however,
there is any reason to doubt the willingness of the wit-
ness to help develop the truth, it may be necessary to
proceed with more caution, and possibly to put the wit-
ness in a position where it will appear to the jury that he
could tell a good deal if he wanted to, and then leave
him. The jury will thus draw the inference that, had he
spoken, it would have been in our favor.

But suppose the witness has testified to material facts
against us, and it becomes our duty to break the force
of his testimony, or abandon all hope of a jury verdict.
How shall we begin? How shall we tell whether the
witness has made an honest mistake, or has committed
perjury? The methods in his cross-examination in the
two instances would naturally be very different. There
is a marked distinction between discrediting the _testi-
mony_ and discrediting the _witness_. It is largely a matter
of instinct on the part of the examiner. Some people
call it the language of the eye, or the tone of the voice,
or the countenance of the witness, or his manner of tes-
tifying, or all combined, that betrays the wilful perjurer.
It is difficult to say exactly what it is, excepting that
constant practice seems to enable a trial lawyer to form
a fairly accurate judgment on this point. A skilful
cross-examiner seldom takes his eye from an important
witness while he is being examined by his adversary.
Every expression of his face, especially his mouth, even
every movement of his hands, his manner of expressing
himself, his whole bearing---all help the examiner to
arrive at an accurate estimate of his integrity.

Let us assume, then, that we have been correct in our
judgment of this particular witness, and that he is trying to
describe honestly the occurrences to which he has testified,
but has fallen into a serious mistake, through ignorance,
blunder, or what not, which must be exposed to the minds
of the jury. How shall we go about it? This brings
us at once to the first important factor in our discus-
sion, the _manner_ of the cross-examiner.

It is absurd to suppose that any witness who has sworn
positively to a certain set of facts, even if he has inadver-
tently stretched the truth, is going to be readily induced
by a lawyer to alter them and acknowledge his mistake.
People as a rule do not reflect upon their meagre oppor-
tunities for observing facts, and rarely suspect the frailty
of their own powers of observation. They come to
court, when summoned as witnesses, prepared to tell
what they think they know; and in the beginning they
resent an attack upon their story as they would one upon
their integrity.

If the cross-examiner allows the witness to see, by his
manner toward him at the start, that he distrusts his
integrity, he will straighten himself in the witness chair
and mentally defy him at once. If, on the other hand,
the counsel's manner is courteous and conciliatory, the
witness will soon lose the fear all witnesses have of the
cross-examiner, and can almost imperceptibly be induced
to enter into a discussion of his testimony in a fair-
minded spirit, which, if the cross-examiner is clever, will
soon disclose the weak points in the testimony. The
sympathies of the jury are invariably on the side of the
witness, and they are quick to resent any discourtesy
toward him. They are willing to admit his _mistakes_,
if you can make them apparent, but are slow to believe
him _guilty of perjury_. Alas, how often this is lost sight
of in our daily court experiences ! One is constantly
brought face to face with lawyers who act as if they
thought that every one who testifies against their side of
the case is committing wilful perjury. No wonder they
accomplish so little with their CROSS-examination! By
their shouting, brow-beating style they often confuse the
wits of the witness, it is true; but they fail to discredit
him with the jury. On the contrary, they elicit sympathy
for the witness they are attacking, and little realize that
their "vigorous cross-examination," at the end of which
they sit down with evident self-satisfaction, has only
served to close effectually the mind of at least one fair-
minded juryman against their side of the case, and as
likely as not it has brought to light some important fact
favorable to the other side which had been overlooked
in the examination-in-chief.

There is a story told of Reverdy Johnson, who once,
in the trial of a case, twitted a brother lawyer with
feebleness of memory, and received the prompt retort,
Yes, Mr. Johnson; but you will please remember that,
unlike the lion in the play, I have something more to do
than _roar_."

The only lawyer I ever heard employ this roaring
method successfully was Benjamin F. Butler. With him
politeness, or even humanity, was out of the question.
And it has been said of him that "concealment and
equivocation were scarcely possible to a witness under
the operation of his methods." But Butler had a won-
derful personality. He was aggressive and even pugna-
cious, but picturesque withal --- witnesses were afraid of
him. Butler was popular with the masses; he usually
had the numerous “hangers-on " in the court room on
his side of the case from the start, and each little point
he would make with a witness met with their ready and
audible approval. This greatly increased the embarrass-
ment of the witness and gave Butler a decided advan-
tage. It must be remembered also that Butler had a
contempt for scruple which would hardly stand him in
good stead at the present time.
Once he was cross-
questioning a witness in his characteristic manner.
The judge interrupted to remind him that the witness
was a Harvard professor. "I know it, your Honor,"
replied Butler; “we hanged one of them the other day.”27/1

On the other hand, it has been said of Rufus Choate,
whose art and graceful qualities of mind certainly entitle
him to the foremost rank among American advocates,
that in the cross-examination of witnesses, “He never
aroused opposition on the part of the witness by attack-
ing him, but disarmed him by the quiet and courteous
manner in which he pursued his examination. He was
quite sure, before giving him up, to expose the weak
parts of his testimony or the bias, if any, which detracted
from the confidence to be given it."28/1 \[One of Choate's
_bon mots_ was that "a lawyer's vacation consisted of the
space between the question put to a witness and his
answer."\]

27/1 "Life Sketches of Eminent Lawyers," G. J. Clark, Esq.

Judah P. Benjamin, “the eminent lawyer of two con-
tinents," used to cross-examine with his eyes. "No
witness could look into Benjamin's black, piercing eyes
and maintain a lie."

Among the English barristers, Sir James Scarlett,
Lord Abinger, had the reputation, as a cross-examiner,
of having outstripped all advocates who, up to that
time, had appeared at the British Bar. The gentle-
manly ease, the polished courtesy, and the Christian
urbanity and affection, with which he proceeded to the
task, did infinite mischief to the testimony of witnesses
who were striving to deceive, or upon whom he found
it expedient to fasten a suspicion."

A good advocate should be a good actor. The most
cautious cross-examiner will often elicit a damaging an-
swer. Now is the time for the greatest self-control. If
you show by your face how the answer hurt, you may
lose your case by that one point alone. How often
one sees the cross-examiner fairly staggered by such an
answer. He pauses, perhaps blushes, and after he has
allowed the answer to have its full effect, finally regains
his self-possession, but seldom his control of the witness.
With the really experienced trial lawyer, such answers,
instead of appearing to surprise or disconcert him, will
seem to come as a matter of course, and will fall perfectly
flat. He will proceed with the next question as if noth-
ing had happened, or even perhaps give the witness an
incredulous smile, as if to say, "Who do you suppose
would believe that for a minute?"

28/1 " Memories of Rufus Choate," Neilson.

An anecdote apropos of this point is told of Rufus
Choate. "A witness for his antagonist let fall, with no
particular emphasis, a statement of a most important fact
from which he saw that inferences greatly damaging to
his client's case might be drawn if skilfully used. He
suffered the witness to go through his statement and
then, as if he saw in it something of great value to
himself, requested him to repeat it carefully that he
might take it down correctly. He as carefully avoided
cross-examining the witness, and in his argument made
not the least allusion to his testimony. When the op-
posing counsel, in his close, came to that part of his case
in his argument, he was so impressed with the idea that
Mr. Choate had discovered that there was something in
that testimony which made in his favor, although he
could not see how, that he contented himself with
merely remarking that though Mr. Choate had seemed
to think that the testimony bore in favor of his client,
it seemed to him that it went to sustain the opposite
side, and then went on with the other parts of his
case."30/1

It is the love of combat which every man possesses
that fastens the attention of the jury upon the progress
of the trial. The counsel who has a pleasant person-
ality; who speaks with apparent frankness; who appears
to be an earnest searcher after truth; who is courteous
to those who testify against him; who avoids delaying
constantly the progress of the trial by innumerable ob-
jections and exceptions to perhaps incompetent but
harmless evidence; who seems to know what he is
about and sits down when he has accomplished it, ex-
hibiting a spirit of fair play on all occasions ---he it is
who creates an atmosphere in favor of the side which
he represents, a powerful though unconscious influence
with the jury in arriving at their verdict. Even if, owing
to the weight of testimony, the verdict is against him,
yet the amount will be far less than the client had
schooled himself to expect.

On the other hand, the lawyer who wearies the court
and the jury with endless and pointless cross-exami-
nations; who is constantly losing his temper and showing
his teeth to the witnesses; who wears a sour, anxious
expression; who possesses a monotonous, rasping, pene-
trating voice; who presents a slovenly, unkempt personal
appearance; who is prone to take unfair advantage of
witness or counsel, and seems determined to win at all
hazards --- soon prejudices a jury against himself and
the client he represents, entirely irrespective of the sworn
testimony in the case.

30/1 "Memories of Rufus Choate," Neilson.

The evidence often seems to be going all one way,
when in reality it is not so at all. The cleverness of the
cross-examiner has a great deal to do with this; he can
often create an atmosphere which will obscure much evi-
dence that would otherwise tell against him. This is
part of the "generalship of a case " in its progress to the
argument, which is of such vast consequence. There is
eloquence displayed in the examination of witnesses as
well as on the argument. "There is _matter_ in _manner_."
I do not mean to advocate that exaggerated manner one
often meets with, which divides the attention of your
hearers between yourself and your question, which often
diverts the attention of the jury from the point you are
trying to make and centres it upon your own idiosyn-
crasies of manner and speech. As the man who was
somewhat deaf and could not get near enough to Henry
Clay in one of his finest efforts, exclaimed, "I didn't
hear a word he said, but, great Jehovah, didn't he make
the motions!"

The very intonations of voice and the expression of
face of the cross-examiner can be made to produce a
marked effect upon the jury and enable them to appre-
ciate fully a point they might otherwise lose altogether.

Once, when cross-examining a witness by the name
of Sampson, who was sued for libel as editor of the
_Referee_, Russell asked the witness a question which he
did not answer. 'Did you hear my question?' said
Russell in a low voice. I did,' said Sampson. 'Did
you understand it?' asked Russell, in a still lower voice.
‘I did,' said Sampson. Then,' said Russell, raising his
voice to its highest pitch, and looking as if he would
spring from his place and seize the witness by the throat,
'why have you not answered it? Tell the jury why
you have not answered it.' A thrill of excitement ran
through the court room. Sampson was overwhelmed,
and he never pulled himself together again."32/1

Speak distinctly yourself, and compel your witness to
do so. Bring out your points so clearly that men of the
most ordinary intelligence can understand them. Keep
your audience ---the jury---always interested and on the
alert. Remember it is the minds of the jury you are
addressing, even though your question is put to the wit-
ness. Suit the modulations of your voice to the subject
under discussion. Rufus Choate's voice would seem to
take hold of the witness, to exercise a certain sway over
him, and to silence the audience into a hush. He allowed
his rich voice to exhibit in the examination of witnesses,
much of its variety and all of its resonance. The contrast
between his tone in examining and that of the counsel
who followed him was very marked.

Mr. Choate's appeal to the jury began long before
his final argument; it began when he first took his seat
before them and looked into their eyes. He generally
contrived to get his seat as near them as was convenient,
if possible having his table close to the Bar, in front of
their seats, and separated from them only by a narrow
space for passage. There he sat, calm, contemplative;
in the midst of occasional noise and confusion solemnly
unruffled; always making some little headway either with
the jury, the court, or the witness; never doing a single
thing which could by possibility lose him favor, ever doing
some little thing to win it; smiling benignantly upon the
counsel when a good thing was said; smiling sympathiz-
ingly upon the jury when any juryman laughed or made
an inquiry; wooing them all the time with his magnetic
glances as a lover might woo his mistress; seeming to
preside over the whole scene with an air of easy superior-
ity; exercising from the very first moment an indefinable
sway and influence upon the minds of all before and
around him. His manner to the jury was that of a
_friend_, a friend solicitous to help them through their
tedious investigation; never that of an expert combatant,
intent on victory, and looking upon them as only instru-
ments for its attainment."33/1
