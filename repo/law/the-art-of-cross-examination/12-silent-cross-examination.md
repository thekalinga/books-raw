## SILENT CROSS-EXAMINATION

Nothing could be more absurd or a greater waste of
time than to cross-examine a witness who has testified to
no material fact against you. And yet, strange as it may
seem, the courts are full of young lawyers ---and alas! not
only young ones --- who seem to feel it their duty to cross-
examine every witness who is sworn. They seem afraid
that their clients or the jury will suspect them of ignorance
or inability to conduct a trial. It not infrequently hap-
pens that such unnecessary examinations result in the
development of new theories of the case for the other
side; and a witness who might have been disposed of as
harmless by mere silence, develops into a formidable
obstacle in the case.

The infinite variety of types of witnesses one meets with
in court makes it impossible to lay down any set rules
applicable to all cases. One seldom comes in contact
with a witness who is in all respects like any one he has
ever examined before; it is this that constitutes the fasci-
nation of the art. The particular method you use in any
given case depends upon the degree of importance you
attach to the testimony given by the witness, even if it
is false. It may be that you have on your own side so
many witnesses who will contradict the testimony, that it
is not worth while to hazard the risks you will necessarily
run by undertaking an elaborate cross-examination. In
such cases by far the better course is to keep your seat
and ask no questions at all. Much depends also, as will
be readily appreciated, upon the age and sex of the wit-
ness. In fact, it may be said that the truly great trial
lawyer is he who, while knowing perfectly well the es-
tablished rules of his art, appreciates when they should
be broken. If the witness happens to be a woman, and
at the close of her testimony-in-chief it seems that she
will be more than a match for the cross-examiner, it often
works like a charm with the jury to practise upon her
what may be styled the silent cross-examination. Rise
suddenly, as if you intended to cross-examine. The wit-
ness will turn a determined face toward you, preparatory
to demolishing you with her first answer. This is the
signal for you to hesitate a moment. Look her over
good-naturedly and as if you were in doubt whether it
would be worth while to question her---and sit down.
It can be done by a good actor in such a manner as to
be equivalent to saying to the jury, “What's the use?
she is only a woman."

John Philpot Curran, known as the most popular ad-
vocate of his time, and second only to Erskine as a jury
lawyer, once indulged himself in this silent mode of
cross-examination, but made the mistake of speaking his
thoughts aloud before he sat down. "There is no use
asking you questions, for I see the villain in your
face." "Do you, sir?" replied the witness with a
smile. "I never knew before that my face was a
looking-glass."

Since the sole object of cross-examination is to break
the force of the adverse testimony, it must be remem-
bered that a futile attempt only strengthens the witness
with the jury. It cannot be too often repeated, there-
fore, that saying nothing will frequently accomplish more
than hours of questioning. It is experience alone that
can teach us which method to adopt.

An amusing instance of this occurred in the trial of
Alphonse Stephani, indicted for the murder of Clinton G.
Reynolds, a prominent lawyer in New York, who had had
the management and settlement of his father's estate.
The defence was insanity; but the prisoner, though evi-
dently suffering from the early stages of some serious
brain disorder, was still not insane in the legal accepta-
tion of the term. He was convicted of murder in the
second degree and sentenced to a life imprisonment.

Stephani was defended by the late William F. Howe,
Esq., who was certainly one of the most successful lawyers
of his time in criminal cases. Howe was not a great
lawyer, but the kind of witnesses ordinarily met with
in such cases he usually handled with a skill that was
little short of positive genius.

Dr. Allan McLane Hamilton, the eminent alienist, had
made a special study of Stephani's case, had visited him
for weeks at the Tombs Prison, and had prepared himself
for a most exhaustive exposition of his mental condition.
Dr. Hamilton had been retained by Mr. Howe, and was
to be put forward by the defence as their chief witness.
Upon calling him to the witness-chair, however, he did
not question his witness so as to lay before the jury the
extent of his experience in mental disorders and his
familiarity with all forms of insanity, nor develop before
them the doctor's peculiar opportunities for judging cor-
rectly of the prisoner's present condition. The wily
advocate evidently looked upon District Attorney De-
Lancey Nicoll and his associates, who were opposed to
him, as a lot of inexperienced youngsters, who would
cross-examine at great length and allow the witness to
make every answer tell with double effect when elicited
by the state's attorney. It has always been supposed
that it was a preconceived plan of action between the
learned doctor and the advocate. In accordance there-
with, and upon the examination-in-chief, Mr. Howe con-
tented himself with this single inquiry:---

>"Dr. Hamilton, you have examined the prisoner at
>the Bar, have you not?"
>
>\
>
>"I have, sir," replied Dr. Hamilton.
>
>\
>
>"Is he, in your opinion, sane or insane?" continued
>Mr. Howe.
>
>\
>
>"Insane," said Dr. Hamilton.
>
>\
>
>"You may cross-examine," thundered Howe, with one
>of his characteristic gestures. There was a hurried con-
>sultation between Mr. Nicoll and his associates.
>
>\
>
>"We have no questions,” remarked Mr. Nicoll, quietly.
>
>\
>
>"What!" exclaimed Howe, “not ask the famous Dr.
>Hamilton a question? Well, _I_ will," and turning to the
>witness began to ask him how close a study he had
>made of the prisoner's symptoms, etc.; when, upon our
>objection, Chief Justice Van Brunt directed the witness
>to leave the witness-box, as his testimony was concluded,
>and ruled that inasmuch as the direct examination had
>been finished, and there had been no cross-examination,
>there was no course open to Mr. Howe but to call his
>next witness!

Mr. Sergeant Ballantine in his autobiography, "Some
Experiences of a Barrister's Life," gives an account of
the trial for murder of a young woman of somewhat pre-
possessing appearance, who was charged with poisoning
her husband. "They were people in a humble class of
life, and it was suggested that she had committed the
act to obtain possession of money from a burial fund,
and also that she was on terms of improper intimacy
with a young man in the neighborhood. A minute
quantity of arsenic was discovered in the body of the
deceased, which in the defence I accounted for by the
suggestion that poison had been used carelessly for
the destruction of rats. Mr. Baron Parke charged the
jury not unfavorably to the prisoner, dwelling pointedly
upon the small quantity of arsenic found in the body,
and the jury without much hesitation acquitted her.
Dr. Taylor, the professor of chemistry and an experi-
enced witness, had proved the presence of arsenic, and,
as I imagine, to the great disappointment of my solici-
tor, who desired a severe cross-examination, I did not
ask him a single question. He was sitting on the bench
and near the judge, who, after he had summed up and
before the verdict was pronounced, remarked to him that
he was surprised at the small amount of arsenic found;
upon which Taylor said that if he had been asked the
question, he should have proved that it indicated, under
the circumstances detailed in evidence, that a very large
quantity had been taken. The professor had learned
never to volunteer evidence, and the counsel for the
prosecution had omitted to put the necessary question.
Mr. Baron Parke, having learned the circumstance by
accidental means, did not feel warranted in using the in-
formation, and I had my first lesson in the art of 'silent
cross-examination.'"

Another exceedingly interesting and useful lesson in
the art of silent cross-examination will be found in the
following story as told by Richard Harris, K. C., in the
_London Law Journal_ for 1902.

>A long time ago, in the East End of London,
>lived a manufacturer of the name of Waring. He
>was in a large way of business, had his country house,
>where his family lived, and his town establishment.
>He was a man of great parochial eminence and respect
>ability.
>
>Among the many hands he employed was a girl of
>the name of Harriet Smith. She came from the country
>and had not quite lost the bloom of rusticity when the
>respectable Mr. Waring fell in love with her. Had
>Harriet known he was married, in all probability she
>would have rejected his respectable attentions. He
>induced her to marry him, but it was to be kept secret;
>her father was not to know of it until such time as suited
>Mr. Waring's circumstances.
>
>In the course of time there were two children;
>and then unfortunately came a crisis in Mr. Waring's
>affairs. He was bankrupt. The factory and ware-
>house were empty, and Harriet was deprived of her
>weekly allowance.
>
>One day when Waring was in his warehouse, won-
>dering, probably, what would be his next step, old Mr.
>Smith, the father of Harriet, called to know what had
>become of his daughter. That,' said Mr. Waring, 'is
>exactly what I should like to know.' She had left him,
>it seemed, for over a year, and, as he understood, was
>last seen in Paris. The old man was puzzled, and
>informed Waring that he would find her out, dead or
>alive; and so went away. It was a strange thing, said the
>woman in whose house Mrs. Waring had apartments, that
>she should have gone away and never inquired about her
>children, especially as she was so fond of them.
>
>She had gone nearly a year, and in a few days Mr.
>Waring was to surrender the premises to his landlord.
>There never was a man who took things more easily
>than Mr. Waring; leaving his premises did not disturb
>him in the least, except that he had a couple of rather
>large parcels which he wanted to get away without
>anybody seeing him. It might be thought that he had
>been concealing some of his property if he were to be
>seen taking them away.
>
>It happened that there had been a youth in his
>employ of the name of Davis --- James Davis --- a plain
>simple lad enough, and of kind obliging disposition.
>He had always liked his old master, and was himself a
>favorite. Since the bankruptcy he had been apprenticed
>to another firm in Whitechapel, and one Saturday night
>as he was strolling along toward the Minories to get
>a little fresh air, suddenly met his old master, who
>greeted him with his usual cordiality and asked him
>if he had an hour to spare, and, if so, would he oblige
>him by helping him to a cab with a couple of parcels
>which belonged to a commercial traveller and contained
>valuable samples? James consented willingly, and
>lighting each a cigar which Mr. Waring produced, they
>walked along, chatting about old times and old friends.
>When they got to the warehouse there were the two
>parcels, tied up in American cloth.
>
>'Here they are,' said Mr. Waring, striking a light.
>'You take one, and I'll take the other; they're pretty
>heavy and you must be careful how you handle them, or
>some of the things might break.'
>
>When they got to the curb of the pavement, Mr.
>Waring said, 'Stop here, and I'll fetch a four-wheeler.'
>
>While James was waiting, a strange curiosity to look
>into the parcels came over him; so strange that it was
>irresistible, and accordingly he undid the end of one
>of them. Imagine the youth's horror when he was
>confronted with a human head that had been chopped
>off at the shoulders!
>
>'My hair stood on end,' said the witness, 'and my hat
>fell off.' But his presence of mind never forsook him.
>He covered the ghastly 'relic of mortality' up and stood
>like a statue, waiting Mr. Waring's return with his cab.
>
>'Jump in, James,' said he, after they had put the
>'samples' on the top of the cab. But James was not in
>the humor to get into the cab. He preferred running
>behind. So he ran behind all along Whitechapel road,
>over London bridge, and away down Old Kent road,
>shouting to every policeman he saw to stop the cab, but
>no policeman took any notice of him except to laugh
>at him for a lunatic. The 'force' does not disturb its
>serenity of mind for trifles.
>
>By and by the cab drew up in a back street in front of
>an empty house, which turned out to be in the possession
>of Mr. Waring's brother; a house built in a part of Old
>London with labyrinths of arches, vaults, and cellars in
>the occupation of rats and other vermin.
>
>James came up, panting, just as his old master had
>taken his first packet of samples into the house. He
>had managed somehow or other to get a policeman to
>listen to him.
>
>The policeman, when Mr. Waring was taking in the
>second parcel, boldly asked him what he'd got there.
>
>'Nothing for you,' said Mr. Waring.
>
>I don't know about that,' replied the policeman;
>'let's have a look.'
>
>Here Mr. Waring lost his presence of mind, and
>offered the policeman, and another member of the force
>who had strolled up, a hundred pounds not to look at
>the parcels.
>
>But the force was not to be tampered with. They
>pushed Mr. Waring inside the house, and there dis-
>covered the ghastly contents of the huge bundles. The
>policemen's suspicions were now aroused, and they pro-
>ceeded to the police station, where the divisional surgeon
>pronounced the remains to be those of a young woman
>who had been dead for a considerable time and buried in
>chloride of lime.
>
>Of course this was no proof of murder, and the
>charge of murder against Waring was not made until a
>considerable time after- not until the old father had
>declared time after time that the remains were those of
>his daughter Harriet.
>
>At length the treasury became so impressed with the
>old man's statement that the officials began to think it
>might be a case of murder after all, especially as there
>were two bullet-wounds at the back of the woman's head,
>and her throat had been cut. There was also some
>proof that she had been buried under the floor of Mr.
>Waring's warehouse, some hair being found in the grave,
>and a button or two from the young woman's jacket.
>
>"All these things tended to awaken the suspicion of
>the treasury officials. Of course there was a suggestion
>that it was a case of suicide, but the Lord Chief Justice
>disposed of that later on at the trial by asking how a
>woman could shoot herself twice in the back of the head,
>cut her throat, bury herself under the floor, and nail the
>boards down over her grave.
>
>"Notwithstanding it was clear that no charge of
>murder could be proved without identification, the treas-
>ury boldly made a dash for the capital charge, in the
>hope that something might turn up. And now, driven
>to their wits' end, old Mr. Smith was examined by one
>of the best advocates of the day, and this is what he
>made of him:---
>
>'You have seen the remains?'
>
>'Yes.'
>
>'Whose do you believe them to be?'
>
>'My daughter's, to the best of my belief.'
>
>'Why do you believe them to be your daughter's?'
>
>'By the height, the color of the hair, and the small-
>ness of the foot and leg.'
>
>'That was all; and it was nothing.'
>
>But there must needs be cross-examination if you are
>to satisfy your client. So the defendant's advocate
>asks:---
>
>'Is there anything else upon which your belief is
>founded?'
>
>'No,' hesitatingly answers the old man, turning his
>hat about as if there was some mystery about it.
>
>There is breathless anxiety in the crowded court, for
>the witness seemed to be revolving something in his
>mind that he did not like to bring out.
>
>'Yes,' he said, after a dead silence of two or three
>minutes. My daughter had a scar on her leg.'
>
>There was sensation enough for the drop scene.
>More cross-examination was necessary now to get rid of
>the business of the scar, and some reëxamination, too.
>
>The mark, it appeared, was caused by Harriet's
>having fallen into the fireplace when she was a girl.
>
>'Did you see the mark on the remains?' asked the
>prisoner's counsel.
>
>'No; I did not examine for it. I hadn't seen it for
>ten years.'
>
>There was much penmanship on the part of the
>treasury, and as many interchanges of smiles between
>the officials as if the discovery had been due to their
>sagacity; and they went about saying, 'How about the
>scar? How will he get over the scar? What do you
>think of the scar?' Strange to say, the defendant's
>advisers thought it prudent to ask the magistrate to
>allow the doctors on both sides to examine the remains
>in order to ascertain whether there was a scar or not,
>and, stranger still, while giving his consent, the magis-
>trate thought it was very immaterial.
>
>It proved to be so material that when it was found
>on the leg, exactly as the old man and a sister had de-
>scribed it, the doctors cut it out and preserved it for
>production at the trial.
>
>After the discovery, of course the result of the trial
>was a foregone conclusion.
>
>It will be obvious to the sagacious reader that the
>blunder indicated was not the only one in the case. On
>the other side was one of equal gravity and more
>unpardonable, which needs no pointing out. Justice,
>baffled by want of tact on one side, was righted by an
>accident on the other.
