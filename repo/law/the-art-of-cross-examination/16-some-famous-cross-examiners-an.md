## SOME FAMOUS CROSS-EXAMINERS AND THEIR METHODS

One of the best ways to acquire the art of cross-
examination is to study the methods of the great cross-
examiners who serve as models for the legal profession.

Indeed, nearly every great cross-examiner attributes
his success to the fact of having had the opportunity
to study the art of some great advocate in actual
practice.

In view of the fact also that a keen interest is always
taken in the personality and life sketches of great cross-
examiners, it has seemed fitting to introduce some brief
sketches of great cross-examiners, and to give some illus-
trations of their methods.

Sir Charles Russell, Lord Russell of Killowen, who
died in February, 1901, while he was Lord Chief Justice
of England, was altogether the most successful cross-
examiner of modern times.. Lord Coleridge said of him
while he was still practising at the bar, and on one
side or the other in nearly every important case tried,
"Russell is the biggest advocate of the century."

It has been said that his success in cross-examination,
like his success in everything, was due to his force of
character. It was his striking personality, added to his
skill and adroitness, which seemed to give him his over
whelming influence over the witnesses whom he cross-
examined. Russell is said to have had a wonderful
faculty for using the brain and knowledge of other men.
Others might possess a knowledge of the subject far in
excess of Russell, but he had the reputation of being
able to make that knowledge valuable and use it in his
examination of a witness in a way altogether unexpected
and unique.

Unlike Rufus Choate, "The Ruler of the Twelve,"
and by far the greatest advocate of the century on this
side of the water, Russell read but little. He belonged
to the category of famous men who "neither found nor
pretended to find any real solace in books." With
Choate, his library of some eight thousand volumes was
his home, and "his authors were the loves of his life."
Choate used to read at his meals and while walking in
the streets, for books were his only pastime. Neither
was Russell a great orator, while Choate was ranked as
“the first orator of his time in any quarter of the globe
where the English language was spoken, or who was
ever seen standing before a jury panel."

Both Russell and Choate were consummate actors;
they were both men of genius in their advocacy. Each
knew the precise points upon which to seize; each
watched every turn of the jury, knew at a glance what
was telling with them, knew how to use to the best
advantage every accident that might arise in the prog-
ress of the case.

One day a junior was taking a note in the orthodox
fashion. Russell was taking no note, but he was thor-
oughly on the alert, glancing about the court, sometimes
at the judge, sometimes at the jury, sometimes at the
witness or the counsel on the other side. Suddenly he
turned to the junior and said, 'What are you doing?'
‘Taking a note,' was the answer. ‘What the devil do
you mean by saying you are taking a note? Why don't
you watch the case?' he burst out. _He_ had been
' watching' the case. Something had happened to make
a change of front necessary, and he wheeled his col-
leagues around almost before they had time to grasp the
new situation."184/1

Russell's maxim for cross-examination was, "Go
straight at the witness and at the point; throw your
cards on the table, mere _finesse_ English juries do not
appreciate."

Speaking of Russell's success as a cross-examiner, his
biographer, Barry O'Brien says: "It was a fine sight to
see him rise to cross-examine. His very appearance
must have been a shock to the witness,--- the manly,
defiant bearing, the noble brow, the haughty look, the
remorseless mouth, those deep-set eyes, widely opened,
and that searching glance which pierced the very soul.
'Russell,' said a member of the Northern Circuit, 'pro-
duced the same effect on a witness that a cobra produces
on a rabbit.' In a certain case he appeared on the
wrong side. Thirty-two witnesses were called, thirty-one
on the wrong side, and one on the right side. Not one
of the thirty-one was broken down in cross-examination;
but the one on the right side was utterly annihilated by
Russell.

184/1 "Life of Lord Russell," Barry O'Brien.

"'How is Russell getting on?' a friend asked one of
the judges of the Parnell Commission during the days
of Pigott's cross-examination. 'Master Charlie is bowl-
ing very straight,' was the answer. 'Master Charlie'
always bowled 'very straight,' and the man at the wicket
generally came quickly to grief. I have myself seen
him approach a witness with great gentleness --- the
gentleness of a lion reconnoitring his prey. I have also
seen him fly at a witness with the fierceness of a tiger.
But, gentle or fierce, he must have always looked a very
ugly object to the man who had gone into the box to
lie."

Rufus Choate had little of Russell's natural force
with which to command his witnesses; his effort was to
magnetize, he was called "the wizard of the court room."
He employed an entirely different method in his cross-
examinations. He never assaulted a witness as if de-
termined to browbeat him. Commenting once on the
cross-examination of a certain eminent counsellor at the
Boston Bar with decided disapprobation, Choate said,
'This man goes at a witness in such a way that he in-
evitably gets the jury all on the side of the witness. I
do not,' he added, 'think that is a good plan.' His own
plan was far more wary, intelligent, and circumspect.
He had a profound knowledge of human nature, of the
springs of human action, of the thoughts of human
hearts. To get at these and make them patent to the
jury, he would ask only a few telling questions--- a very
few questions, but generally every one of them was fired
point-blank, and hit the mark. His motto was: 'Never
cross-examine any more than is absolutely necessary.
If you don't break your witness, he breaks you.' He
treated every man who appeared like a fair and honest
person on the stand, as if upon the presumption that he
was a gentleman; and if a man appeared badly, he
demolished him, but with the air of a surgeon perform-
ing a disagreeable amputation--- as if he was profoundly
sorry for the necessity. Few men, good or bad, ever
cherished any resentment against Choate for his cross-
examination of them. His whole style of address to the
occupants of the witness-stand was soothing, kind, and
reassuring. When he came down heavily to crush a
witness, it was with a calm, resolute decision, but no
asperity --- nothing curt, nothing tart.”186/1

Choate's idea of the proper length of an address to
a jury was that "a speaker makes his impression, if he
ever makes it, in the first _hour_, sometimes in the first
fifteen minutes; for if he has a proper and firm grasp
of his case, he then puts forth the outline of his grounds
of argument. He plays the _overture_, which hints at or
announces all the airs of the coming opera. All the
rest is mere filling up: answering objections, giving one
juryman little arguments with which to answer the ob-
jections of his fellows, etc. Indeed, this may be taken
as a fixed rule, that the popular mind can never be vig-
orously addressed, deeply moved, and stirred and fixed
more than _one hour_ in any single address."

186/1 "Reminiscences of Rufus Choate," Parker.


What Choate was to America, and Erskine, and later
Russell, to England, John Philpot Curran was to Ireland.
He ranked as a jury lawyer next to Erskine. The son
of a peasant, he became Master of Rolls for Ireland in 1806.
He had a small, slim body, a stuttering, harsh,
shrill voice, originally of such a diffident nature that in
the midst of his first case he became speechless and
dropped his brief to the floor, and yet by perseverance
and experience he became one of the most eloquent and
powerful forensic advocates of the world. As a cross-
examiner it was said of Curran that he could unravel
the most ingenious web which perjury ever spun, he
could seize on every fault and inconsistency, and build
on them a denunciation terrible in its earnestness."187/1
It was said of Scarlett, Lord Abinger, that he won
his cases because there were twelve Sir James Scarletts
in the jury-box. He became one of the leading jury
lawyers of his time, so far as winning verdicts was con-
cerned. Scarlett used to wheedle the juries over the
weak places in his case. Choate would rush them right
over with that enthusiasm which he put into everything
"with fire in his eye and fury on his tongue." Scarlett
would level himself right down to each juryman, while
he flattered and won them. In his cross-examinations
"he would take those he had to examine, as it were by
the hand, made them his friends, entered into familiar
conversation with them, encouraged them to tell him
what would best answer his purpose, and thus secured a
victory without appearing to commence a conflict."

187/1 "Life Sketches of Eminent Lawyers," Gilbert J. Clark.


A story is told about Scarlett by Justice Wightman who
was leaving his court one day and found himself walking
in a crowd alongside a countryman, whom he had seen, day
by day, serving as a juryman, and to whom he could not
help speaking. Liking the look of the man, and finding
that this was the first occasion on which he had been at
the court, Judge Wightman asked him what he thought
of the leading counsel. "Well," said the countryman,
" that lawyer Brougham be a wonderful man, he can talk,
he can, but I don't think nowt of Lawyer Scarlett."---
"Indeed!" exclaimed the judge, "you surprise me, for
you have given him all the verdicts."--- "Oh, there's nowt
in that,” was the reply," he be so lucky, you see, he be
always on the right side."188/1

Choate also had a way of getting himself "into the
jury-box," and has been known to address a single jury-
man, who he feared was against him, for an hour at a
time. After he had piled up proof and persuasion all
together, one of his favorite expressions was, But this
is only _half_ my case, gentlemen, I go now to the main
body of my proofs."

188/1 "Curiosities of Law and Lawyers."


Like Scarlett, Erskine was of medium height and
slender, but he was handsome and magnetic, quick and
nervous, "his motions resembled those of a blood horse
---as light, as limber, as much betokening strength and
speed." He, too, lacked the advantage of a college edu-
cation and was at first painfully unready of speech. In
his maiden effort he would have abandoned his case,
had he not felt, as he said, that his children were tug-
ging at his gown. "In later years," Choate once said of
him, "he spoke the best English ever spoken by an ad-
vocate." Once, when the presiding judge threatened to
commit him for contempt, he replied, "Your Lordship
may proceed in what manner you think fit; I know my
duty as well as your Lordship knows yours." His simple
grace of diction, quiet and natural passion, was in marked
contrast to Rufus Choate, whose delivery has been de-
scribed as "a musical flow of rhythm and cadence, more
like a long, rising, and swelling song than a _talk_ or an
argument." To one of his clients who was dissatisfied
with Erskine's efforts in his behalf, and who had written
his counsellor on a slip of paper, "I'll be hanged if I
don't plead my own cause," Erskine quietly replied,
"You'll be hanged if you do." Erskine boasted that
in twenty years he had never been kept a day from court
by ill health. And it is said of Curran that he has been
known to rise before a jury, after a session of sixteen
hours with only twenty minutes' intermission, and make
one of the most memorable arguments of his life.

Among the more modern advocates of the English
Bar, Sir Henry Hawkins stands out conspicuously. He
is reputed to have taken more money away with him
from the Bar than any man of his generation. His lead-
ing characteristic when at the Bar, was his marvellous
skill in cross-examination. He was associated with Lord
Coleridge in the first Tichborne trial, and in his cross-
examination of the witnesses, Baignet and Carter, he
made his reputation as "the foremost cross-examiner in
the world."190/1 Sir Richard Webster was another great
cross-examiner. He is said to have received $100,000 for
his services in the trial before the Parnell Special Commis-
sion, in which he was opposed to Sir Charles Russell.

Rufus Choate said of Daniel Webster, that he con-
sidered him the grandest lawyer in the world. And on
his death-bed Webster called Choate the most brilliant
man in America. Parker relates an episode character-
istic of the clashing of swords between these two idols
of the American Bar. "We heard Webster once, in
a sentence and a look, crush an hour's argument of
Choate's curious workmanship; it was most intellectu-
ally wire-drawn and hair-splitting, with Grecian sophis-
try, and a subtlety the Leontine Gorgias might have
envied. It was about two car-wheels, which to common
eyes looked as like as two eggs; but Mr. Choate, by a
fine line of argument between tweedle-dum and tweedle-
dee, and a discourse on 'the fixation of points' so deep
and fine as to lose itself in obscurity, showed the jury
there was a heaven-wide difference between them.
'But,' said Mr. Webster, and his great eyes opened wide
and black, as he stared at the big twin wheels before
him, 'gentlemen of the jury, there they are--- look at
'em;' and as he pronounced this answer, in tones of vast
volume, the distorted wheels seemed to shrink back
again into their original similarity, and the long argu-
ment on the ‘fixation of points' died a natural death.
It was an example of the ascendency of mere character
over mere _intellectuality_; but so much greater, never-
theless, the _intellectuality_."191/1

190/1 "Life Sketches of Eminent Lawyers," Clark.


Jeremiah Mason was quite on a par with either Choate
or Webster before a jury. His style was conversational
and plain. He was no orator. He would go close up
to the jury-box, and in the plainest possible logic force
conviction upon his hearers. Webster said he "owed
his own success to the close attention he was compelled
to pay for nine successive years, day by day, to Mason's
efforts at the same Bar." As a cross-examiner he had no
peer at the New England Bar.

In the history of our own New York Bar there have
been, probably, but few equals of Judge William Fuller
ton as a cross-examiner. He was famous for his calmness
and mildness of manner, his rapidly repeated questions;
his sallies of wit interwoven with his questions, and an
ingenuity of method quite his own.

191/1 " Reminiscences of Rufus Choate," Parker.


Fullerton's cross-examinations in the celebrated Tilton
_vs._ Henry Ward Beecher case gave him an international
reputation, and were considered the best ever heard in
this country. And yet these very examinations, labori-
ous and brilliant, were singularly unproductive of results,
owing probably to the unusual intelligence and shrewd-
ness of the witnesses themselves. The trial as a whole
was by far the most celebrated of its kind the New York
courts have ever witnessed. One of the most eminent
of Christian preachers was charged with using the per-
suasive powers of his eloquence, strengthened by his
religious influence, to alienate the affections and destroy
the probity of a member of his church ---a devout and
theretofore pure-souled woman, the wife of a long-loved
friend. He was charged with continuing the guilty rela-
tion during the period of a year and a half, and of cloak-
ing the offence to his own conscience and to hers under
specious words of piety; of invoking first divine blessing
on it, and then divine guidance out of it; and finally of
adding perjury to seduction in order to escape the con-
sequences. His accusers, moreover, Mr. Tilton and Mr.
Moulton, were persons of public reputation and honorable
station in life.

The length and complexity of Fullerton's cross-exami-
nations preclude any minute mention of them here.
Once when he found fault with Mr. Beecher for not
answering his questions more freely and directly, the
reply was frankly made, _I am afraid of you_!"

While cross-examining Beecher about the celebrated
"ragged letter," Fullerton asked why he had not made
an explanation to the church, if he was innocent. Beecher
answered that he was keeping his part of the compact of
silence, and added that he did not believe the others were
keeping theirs. There was audible laughter throughout
the court room at this remark, and Judge Neilson ordered
the court officer to remove from the court room any per-
son found offending --- "Except the counsel," spoke up
Mr. Fullerton. Later the cross-examiner exclaimed im-
patiently to Mr. Beecher that he was bound to find out
all about these things before he got through, to which
Beecher retorted, "I don't think you are succeeding very
well."

_Mr. Fullerton_ (in a voice like thunder). "Why did you
not rise up and deny the charge?"

_Mr. Beecher_ (putting into his voice all that marvellous
magnetic force, which so distinguished him from other
men of his time). "Mr. Fullerton, that is not my habit
of mind, nor my manner of dealing with men and
things."

_Mr. Fullerton_. "So I observe. You say that Theo-
dore Tilton's charge of intimacy with his wife, and the
charges made by your church and by the committee of
your church, made no impression on you?"

_Mr. Beecher_ (shortly). “Not the slightest."

At this juncture Mr. Thomas G. Sherman, Beecher's
personal counsel, jumped to his client's aid, and remarked
that it was a singular coincidence that when counsel had
not the record before him, he never quoted correctly.

_Mr. Fullerton_ (addressing the court impressively).
When Mr. Sherman is not impertinent, he is nothing
in this case."

_Judge Neilson_ (to the rescue). "Probably counsel
thought --- "

_Mr. Fullerton_ (interrupting). "What Mr. Sherman
thinks, your Honor, cannot possibly be of sufficient
importance to take up the time either of the court or
opposing counsel.”

"Are you in the habit of having your sermons pub-
lished?" continued Mr. Fullerton. Mr. Beecher ac-
knowledged that he was, and also that he had preached
a sermon on The Nobility of Confession."

_Mr. Sherman_ (sarcastically). "I hope Mr. Fullerton
is not going to preach us a sermon."

_Mr. Fullerton_. "I would do so if I thought I could
convert brother Sherman."

_Mr. Beecher_ (quietly). “I will be happy to give you
the use of my pulpit."

_Mr. Fullerton_ (laughing). “Brother Sherman is the
only audience I shall want."

_Mr. Beecher_ (sarcastically). "Perhaps he is the only
audience you can get."

_Mr. Fullerton_. "If I succeed in converting brother
Sherman, I will consider my work as a Christian minister
complete."

Mr. Fullerton then read a passage from the sermon,
the effect of which was that if a person commits a great
sin, and the exposure of it would cause misery, such a
person would not be justified in confessing it, merely to
relieve his own conscience. Mr. Beecher admitted that
he still considered that “sound doctrine.”

At this point Mr. Fullerton turned to the court, and
pointing to the clock, said, "Nothing comes after the
sermon, I believe, but the benediction." His Honor
took the hint, and the proceedings adjourned.195/1

In this same trial Hon. William M. Evarts, as leading
counsel for Mr. Beecher, heightened his already inter-
national reputation as an advocate. It was Mr. Evarts's
versatility in the Beecher case that occasioned so much
comment. Whether he was examining in chief or on
cross, in the discussion of points of evidence, or in the
summing up, he displayed equally his masterly talents.
His cross-examination of Theodore Tilton was a master-
piece. His speeches in court were clear, calm, and logi-
cal. Mr. Evarts was not only a great lawyer, but an
orator and statesman of the highest distinction. He has
been called "the Prince of the American Bar." He
was a gentleman of high scholarship and fine literary
tastes. His manner in the trial of a case has been
described by some one as "all head, nose, voice, and
forefinger." He was five feet seven inches tall, thin and
slender, “ with a face like parchment."

195/1 Extracts from the daily press accounts of the proceedings of one of the
thirty days of the trial, as reported in "Modern Jury Trials," Donovan.


Mr. Joseph H. Choate once told me he considered
that he owed his own success in court to the nine years
during which he acted as Mr. Evarts's junior in the trial
of cases. No one but Mr. Choate himself would have
said this. His transcendent genius as an advocate could
not have been acquired from any tutelage under Mr.
Evarts. When Mr. Choate accepted his appointment as
Ambassador to the Court of St. James, he retired from
the practice of the law; and it is therefore permissible to
comment upon his marvellous talents as a jury lawyer.
He was not only easily the leading trial lawyer of the
New York Bar, but was by many thought to be the
representative lawyer of the American Bar. Surely no
man of his time was more successful in winning juries.
His career was one uninterrupted success. Not that he
shone especially in any particular one of the duties of the
trial lawyer, but he was preëminent in the quality of his
humor and keenness of satire. His whole conduct of a
case, his treatment of witnesses, of the court, of opposing
counsel, and especially of the jury, were so irresistibly
fascinating and winning that he carried everything before
him. One would emerge from a three weeks' contest
with Choate in a state almost of mental exhilaration,
despite the jury's verdict.

It was not so with the late Edward C. James; a contest
with him meant great mental and physical fatigue for
his opponent. James was ponderous and indefatigable.
His cross-examinations were labored in the extreme.
His manner as an examiner was dignified and forceful,
his mind always alert and centred on the subject before
him; but he had none of Mr. Choate's fascination or
brilliancy. He was dogged, determined, heavy. He
would pound at you incessantly, but seldom reached the
mark. He literally wore out his opponent, and could
never realize that he was on the wrong side of a case
until the foreman of the jury told him so. Even then
he would want the jury polled to see if there was not
some mistake. James never smiled except in triumph
and when his opponent frowned. When Mr. Choate
smiled, you couldn't help smiling with him. During the
last ten years of his life James was found on one side or
the other of most of the important cases that were tried.
He owed his success to his industrious and indefatigable
qualities as a fighter; not, I think, to his art.

James T. Brady was called "the Curran of the New
York Bar." His success was almost entirely due to his
courtesy and the marvellous skill of his cross-examina-
tions. He had a serene, captivating manner in court,
and was one of the foremost orators of his time. He
has the proud record of having defended fifty men on
trial for their lives, and of saving every one of them from
the gallows.

On the other hand, William A. Beech, "the Hamlet
of the American Bar," was a poor cross-examiner. He
treated all his witnesses alike. He was methodical, but
of a domineering manner. He was slow to attune him-
self to an unexpected turn in a case he might be con-
ducting. He lost many cases and was not fitted to
conduct a desperate one. It was as a court orator that
he was preëminent. His speech in the Beecher case
alone would have made him a reputation as a consum-
mate orator. His vocabulary was surprisingly rich and
his voice wonderfully winning.

It is said of James W. Gerard, the elder, that "he ob-
tained the greatest number of verdicts against evidence
of any one who ever practised at the New York Bar. He
was full of expedients and possessed extraordinary tact.
In his profound knowledge of human nature and his
ready adaptation, in the conduct of trials, to the pecu-
liarities, caprices, and whims of the different juries before
whom he appeared he was almost without a rival.
Any one who witnessed the telling hits made by Mr.
Gerard on cross-examination, and the sensational inci-
dents sprung by him upon his opponents, the court, and
the jury, would have thought that he acted upon the
inspiration of the moment ---that all he did and all he
said was _impromptu_. In fact, Mr. Gerard made thorough
preparation for trial. Generally his hits in cross-exami-
nation were the result of previous preparation. He
made briefs for cross-examination. To a large extent his
flashes of wit and his extraordinary and grotesque humor
were well pondered over and studied up beforehand."199/1

Justice Miller said of Roscoe Conkling that "he was
one of the greatest men intellectually of his time." He
was more than fifty years of age when he abandoned his
arduous public service at Washington, and opened an
office in New York City. During his six years at the
New York Bar, such was his success, that he is reputed
to have accumulated, for a lawyer, a very large fortune.
He constituted himself a barrister and adopted the plan
of acting only as counsel. He was fluent and eloquent
of speech, most thorough in the preparation of his cases,
and an accomplished cross-examiner. Despite his public
career, he said of himself, "My proper place is to be be-
fore twelve men in the box." Conkling used to study
for his cross-examinations, in important cases, with the
most painstaking minuteness. In the trial of the Rev.
Henry Burge for murder, Conkling saw that the case
was likely to turn upon the cross-examination of Dr.
Swinburne, who had performed the autopsy. The
charge of the prosecution was that Mrs. Burge had
been strangled by her husband, who had then cut her
throat. In order to disprove this on cross-examination,
Mr. Conkling procured a body for dissection and had
dissected, in his presence, the parts of the body that he
wished to study. As the result of Dr. Swinburne's cross-
examination at the trial, the presiding judge felt com-
pelled to declare the evidence so entirely untrustworthy
that he would decline to submit it to the jury and directed
that the prisoner be set at liberty.

199/1 " Extraordinary Cases," Henry Lauran Clinton.

This studious preparation for cross-examination was one
of the secrets of the success of Benjamin F. Butler. He
was once known to have spent days in examining all parts
of a steam-engine, and even learning to drive one himself,
in order to cross-examine some witnesses in an impor-
tant case in which he had been retained. At another
time Butler spent a week in the repair shop of a rail-
road, part of the time with coat off and hammer in hand,
ascertaining the capabilities of iron to resist pressure---
a point on which his case turned. To use his own lan-
guage: "A lawyer who sits in his office and prepares his
cases only by the statements of those who are brought
to him, will be very likely to be beaten. A lawyer in
full practice, who carefully prepares his cases, must study
almost every variety of business and many of the
sciences." A pleasant humor and a lively wit, coupled
with wonderful thoroughness and acuteness, were But-
ler's leading characteristics. He was not a great lawyer,
nor even a great advocate like Rufus Choate, and yet
he would frequently defeat Choate. His cross-examina-
tion was his chief weapon. Here he was fertile in re-
source and stratagem to a degree attained by few others.
Choate had mastered all the little tricks of the trial
lawyer, but he attained also to the grander thoughts
and the logical powers of the really great advocate.
Butler's success depended upon zeal, combined with
shrewdness and not overconscientious trickery.

In his autobiography, Butler gives several examples
of what he was pleased to call his legerdemain, and to
believe were illustrations of his skill as a cross-examiner.
They are quoted from “ Butler's Book," but are not re-
printed as illustrations of the subtler forms of cross-
examination, but rather as indicative of the tricks to
which Butler owed much of his success before country
juries.

>I had a young client who was on a railroad car when

>deal of the time in giving a very learned and somewhat
>technical description of the condition of my client. He
>admitted that my client's nervous system was very much
>shattered, but he also stated that it would probably be
>only temporary. Of all this I took little notice; for, to

Robert Ingersoll took part in numerous noted law-
suits in all parts of the country. But he was almost
helpless in court without a competent junior. He was a
born orator if ever there was one. Henry Ward Beecher
regarded him as "the most brilliant speaker of the Eng-
lish tongue in any land on the globe." He was not a pro-
found lawyer, however, and hardly the equal of the most
mediocre trial lawyer in the examination of witnesses.
Of the art of cross-examining witnesses he knew prac-
tically nothing. His definition of a lawyer, to use his
own words, was "a sort of intellectual strumpet." "My
ideal of a great lawyer," he once wrote, "is that great
English attorney who accumulated a fortune of a million
pounds, and left it all in his will to make a home for
idiots, declaring that he wanted to give it back to the
people from whom he took it."

Judge Walter H. Sanborn relates a conversation he
had with Judge Miller of the United States Court about
Ingersoll. "Just after Colonel Ingersoll had concluded
an argument before Mr. Justice Miller, while on Circuit
I came into the court and remarked to Judge Miller that
I wished I had got there a little sooner, as I had never
heard Colonel Ingersoll make a legal argument."---
"Well," said Judge Miller, "you never will."207/1

Ingersoll's genius lay in other directions. Who but
Ingersoll could have written the following:---

"A little while ago I stood by the grave of the old
Napoleon ---a magnificent tomb of gilt and gold, fit al-
most for a dead deity, and gazed upon the sarcophagus
of black marble, where rest at last the ashes of that rest-
less man. I leaned over the balustrade, and thought
about the career of the greatest soldier of the modern
world. I saw him walking upon the banks of the Seine,
contemplating suicide; I saw him at Toulon; I saw him
putting down the mob in the streets of Paris; I saw him
at the head of the army in Italy; I saw him crossing the
bridge of Lodi, with the tricolor in his hand; I saw him
in Egypt, in the shadows of the Pyramids; I saw him
conquer the Alps, and mingle the eagles of France with
the eagles of the crags; I saw him at Marengo, at Ulm,
and at Austerlitz; I saw him in Russia, where the infan-
try of the snow and the cavalry of the wild blast scat-
tered his legions like winter's withered leaves. I saw
him at Leipsic, in defeat and disaster; driven by a mill-
ion bayonets back upon Paris; clutched like a wild
beast; banished to Elba. I saw him escape and retake
an empire by the force of his genius. I saw him upon
the frightful field of Waterloo, where chance and fate
combined to wreck the fortunes of their former king.
And I saw him at St. Helena, with his hands crossed
behind him, gazing out upon the sad and solemn sea.
I thought of the orphans and widows he had made, of
the tears that had been shed for his glory, and of the
only woman who had ever loved him, pushed from his
heart by the cold hand of ambition. And I said I would
rather have been a French peasant, and worn wooden
shoes; I would rather have lived in a hut, with a vine
growing over the door, and the grapes growing purple in
the kisses of the autumn sun. I would rather have been
that poor peasant, with my loving wife by my side, knit-
ting as the day died out of the sky, with my children
upon my knees, and their arms about me. I would
rather have been that man, and gone down to the tongue-
less silence of the dreamless dust, than to have been that
imperial impersonation of force and murder, known as
Napoleon the Great."
