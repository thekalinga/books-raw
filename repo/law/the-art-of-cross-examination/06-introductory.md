## INTRODUCTORY

"The issue of a cause rarely depends upon a speech
and is but seldom even affected by it. But there is never
a cause contested, the result of which is not mainly de-
pendent upon the skill with which the advocate conducts
his cross-examination."

This is the conclusion arrived at by one of England's
greatest advocates at the close of a long and eventful
career at the Bar. It was written some fifty years ago
and at a time when oratory in public trials was at its
height. It is even more true at the present time, when
what was once commonly reputed a "great speech" is
seldom heard in our courts, --- because the modern meth-
ods of practising our profession have had a tendency
to discourage court oratory and the development of
orators. The old-fashioned orators who were wont
to "grasp the thunderbolt " are now less in favor
than formerly. With our modern jurymen the arts of
oratory, --- â€œlaw-papers on fire," as Lord Brougham's
speeches used to be called, --- though still enjoyed as im-
passioned literary efforts, have become almost useless as
persuasive arguments or as a "summing up" as they are
now called.

Modern juries, especially in large cities, are composed
of practical business men accustomed to think for them-
selves, experienced in the ways of life, capable of forming
estimates and making nice distinctions, unmoved by the
passions and prejudices to which court oratory is nearly
always directed. Nowadays, jurymen, as a rule, are wont
to bestow upon testimony the most intelligent and pains-
taking attention, and have a keen scent for truth. It is
not intended to maintain that juries are no longer human,
or that in certain cases they do not still go widely astray,
led on by their prejudices if not by their passions. Nev-
ertheless, in the vast majority of trials, the modern jury-
man, and especially the modern city juryman, --- it is
in our large cities that the greatest number of litigated
cases is tried, --- comes as near being the model arbiter of
fact as the most optimistic champion of the institution of
trial by jury could desire.

I am aware that many members of my profession still
sneer at trial by jury. Such men, however, --- when not
among the unsuccessful and disgruntled, --- will, with but
few exceptions, be found to have had but little practice
themselves in court, or else to belong to that ever grow-
ing class in our profession who have relinquished their
court practice and are building up fortunes such as were
never dreamed of in the legal profession a decade ago,
by becoming what may be styled business lawyers ---
men who are learned in the law as a profession, but who
through opportunity, combined with rare commercial abil-
ity, have come to apply their learning --- especially their
knowledge of corporate law --- to great commercial enter-
prises, combinations, organizations, and reorganizations,
and have thus come to practise law as a business.

To such as these a book of this nature can have but
little interest. It is to those who by choice or chance
are, or intend to become, engaged in that most laborious
of all forms of legal business, the trial of cases in court,
that the suggestions and experiences which follow are
especially addressed.

It is often truly said that many of our best lawyers
--- I am speaking now especially of New York City ---
are withdrawing from court practice because the nature
of the litigation is changing. To such an extent is this
change taking place in some localities that the more im-
portant commercial cases rarely reach a court decision.
Our merchants prefer to compromise their difficulties,
or to write off their losses, rather than enter into litiga-
tions that must remain dormant in the courts for upward
of three years awaiting their turn for a hearing on the
overcrowded court calendars. And yet fully six thou-
sand cases of one kind or another are tried or disposed
of yearly in the Borough of Manhattan alone.

This congestion is not wholly due to lack of judges,
or that they are not capable and industrious men; but is
largely, it seems to me, the fault of the system in vogue
in all our American courts of allowing any lawyer, duly
enrolled as a member of the Bar, to practise in the
highest courts. In the United States we recognize no
distinction between barrister and solicitor; we are all
barristers and solicitors by turn. One has but to fre-
quent the courts to become convinced that, so long as
the ten thousand members at the New York County
Bar all avail themselves of their privilege to appear in
court and try their own clients' cases, the great majority
of the trials will be poorly conducted, and much valuable
time wasted.

The conduct of a case in court is a peculiar art for
which many men, however learned in the law, are not
fitted; and where a lawyer has but one or even a dozen
experiences in court in each year, he can never become
a competent trial lawyer. I am not addressing myself
to clients, who often assume that, because we are duly
qualified as lawyers, we are therefore competent to try
their cases; I am speaking in behalf of our courts,
against the congestion of the calendars, and the conse-
quent crowding out of weighty commercial litigations.

One _experienced_ in the trial of causes will not require,
at the utmost, more than a quarter of the time taken by
the most learned inexperienced lawyer in developing his
facts. His case will be thoroughly prepared and under-
stood before the trial begins. His points of law and
issues of fact will be clearly defined and presented to the
court and jury in the fewest possible words. He will in
this way avoid many of the erroneous rulings on ques-
tions of law and evidence which are now upsetting so
many verdicts on appeal. He will not only complete
his trial in shorter time, but he will be likely to bring
about an equitable verdict in the case which may not be
appealed from at all, or, if appealed, will be sustained by
a higher court, instead of being sent back for a retrial
and the consequent consumption of the time of another
judge and jury in doing the work all over again./1

These facts are being more and more appreciated each
year, and in our local courts there is already an ever
increasing coterie of trial lawyers, who are devoting the
principal part of their time to court practice.

A few lawyers have gone so far as to refuse direct
communication with clients excepting as they come rep-
resented by their own attorneys. It is pleasing to note
that some of our leading advocates who, having been
called away from large and active law practice to enter
the government service, have expressed their intention,
when they resume the practice of the law, to refuse all
cases where clients are not already represented by com-
petent attorneys, recognizing, at least in their own prac-
tice, the English distinction between the barrister and
solicitor. We are thus beginning to appreciate in this
country what the English courts have so long recog-
nized that the only way to insure speedy and intelli-
gently conducted litigations is to _inaugurate a custom_
of confining court practice to a comparatively limited
number of trained trial lawyers.

/1 In the Borough of Manhattan at the present time thirty-three per cent of
the cases tried are appealed, and forty-two per cent of the cases appealed are
reversed and sent back for re-trial as shown by the court statistics.

The distinction between general practitioners and
specialists is already established in the medical profes-
sion and largely accepted by the public. Who would
think nowadays of submitting himself to a serious opera-
tion at the hands of his family physician, instead of
calling in an experienced surgeon to handle the knife?
And yet the family physician may have once been com-
petent to play the part of surgeon, and doubtless has
had, years ago, his quota of hospital experience. But
he so infrequently enters the domain of surgery that he
shrinks from undertaking it, except under circumstances
where there is no alternative. There should be a simi-
lar distinction in the legal profession. The family law-
yer may have once been competent to conduct the
litigation; but he is out of practice --- he is not "in
training" for the competition.

There is no short cut, no royal road to proficiency, in
the art of advocacy. It is experience, and one might
almost say experience alone, that brings success. I am
not speaking of that small minority of men in all walks
of life who have been touched by the magic wand of
genius, but of men of average endowments and even
special aptitude for the calling of advocacy; with them
it is a race of experience. The experienced advocate
can look back upon those less advanced in years or expe-
rience, and rest content in the thought that they are just
so many cases behind him; that if he keeps on, with
equal opportunities in court, they can never overtake
him. Some day the public will recognize this fact.
But at present, what does the ordinary litigant know of
the advantages of having counsel to conduct his case
who is "at home" in the court room, and perhaps even
acquainted with the very panel of jurors before whom
his case is to be heard, through having already tried one
or more cases for other clients before the same men?
How little can the ordinary business man realize the
value to himself of having a lawyer who understands the
habits of thought and of looking at evidence --- the bent
of mind--- of the very judge who is to preside at the
trial of his case. Not that our judges are not eminently
fair-minded in the conduct of trials; but they are men
for all that, oftentimes very human men; and the trial
lawyer who knows his judge, starts with an advantage
that the inexperienced practitioner little appreciates.
How much, too, does experience count in the selection
of the jury itself ---one of the "fine arts" of the advocate !
These are but a few of the many similar advantages one
might enumerate, were they not apart from the subject
we are now concerned with--- the skill of the advocate
in conducting the trial itself, once the jury has been
chosen.

When the public realizes that a good trial lawyer is
the outcome, one might say of generations of witnesses,
when clients fully appreciate the dangers they run in
intrusting their litigations to so-called â€œoffice lawyers"
with little or no experience in court, they will insist upon
their briefs being intrusted to those who make a spe-
cialty of court practice, advised and assisted, if you will,
by their own private attorneys. One of the chief dis-
advantages of our present system will be suddenly swept
away; the court calendars will be cleared by speedily
conducted trials; issues will be tried within a reasonable
time after they are framed; the commercial cases, now
disadvantageously settled out of court or abandoned
altogether, will return to our courts to the satisfaction
both of the legal profession and of the business commu-
nity at large; causes will be more skilfully tried --- the
art of cross-examination more thoroughly understood.
