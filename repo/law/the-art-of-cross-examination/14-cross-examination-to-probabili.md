## CROSS-EXAMINATION TO PROBABILITIES --- PERSONALITY OF THE EXAMINER, ETC.

In delivering one of his celebrated judgments Lord
Mansfield said: "As mathematical and absolute cer-
tainty is seldom to be attained in human affairs, reason
and public utility require that judges and all mankind
in forming their opinion of the truth of facts should
be regulated by the superior number of _probabilities_
on the one side or the other."

Theoretically the goal we all strive for in litigation.
is the _probable_ truth. It is therefore in this effort to
develop the probabilities in any given case, that a trial
lawyer is called upon for the exercise of the most
active imagination and profound knowledge of men and
things.

It requires but little experience in court to arrive
at the conclusion that the great majority of cases are
composed of a few principal facts surrounded by a host
of minor ones; and that the strength of either side of
a case depends not so much upon the direct testimony
relating to these principal facts alone, but, as one writer
very tersely puts it, "upon the _support_ given them by
the probabilities created by establishing and developing
the relation of the _minor_ facts in the case."

One of the latest causes of any importance, tried in
our New York courts this year, afforded an excellent
illustration of the relative importance of the main facts
in a case to the multitudinous _little_ things which sur-
round any given issue, and which when carefully
gathered together and skilfully grouped, create the
probabilities of a case. The suit was upon an oral
agreement for the purchase and sale of a large block
of mining stock with _an alleged guaranty against loss_.
The plaintiff and defendant were both gentlemen hold-
ing prominent positions in the business world and of
unquestioned integrity and veracity. The only issue in
the case was the simple question, which one was correct
in his memory of a conversation that had occurred five
years before. The plaintiff swore there was an agree-
ment by the defendant to repurchase the stock from
him, at the price paid, at plaintiff's option. The de-
fendant swore no such conversation ever took place.
Where was the truth? The direct yea and nay of this
proposition occupied about five minutes of the court's
time. The surrounding circumstances, the countless
straws pointing to the probabilities on the one side or
the other, occupied three full days, and no time was
wasted.

In almost every trial there are circumstances which
at first may appear light, valueless, even disconnected,
but which, if skilfully handled, become united together
and at last form wedges which drive conviction into
the mind. This is obviously the business of the
cross-examiner, although it is true that the examina-
tion of one's own witnesses, as well, often plays an
important part in the development of probabilities.

All men stamp as probable or improbable that which
they themselves would, or would not, have said or done
under similar circumstances. "As in water, face an-
swereth to face, so the heart of man to man."156/1 Things
_inconsistent_ with human knowledge and experience are
properly rated as improbable. It was Aristotle who
first said, “Probability is never detected bearing false
testimony."

Apart from experience in human affairs and the
resultant knowledge of men, it is _industry_ and diligent
preparation for the trial which will enable an advocate
to handle the circumstances surrounding the main facts
in a case with the greatest effect upon a judge or jury.

One who has thought intently upon a subject which
he is going to develop later on in a court, and has
sought diligently for signs or "straws to enable him
to discover the true solution of a controversy, will, when
the occasion arises upon the trial, catch and apply facts
which a less thoughtful person would pass by almost
unnoticed. Careful study of his case before he comes
into court will usually open to an advocate avenues for
successful cross-examinations to the probabilities of a
story, which will turn out to be his main arguments for
a successful verdict in his favor.

156/1 Proverbs xxvii. 19.

"It is acute knowledge of human nature, thorough
preliminary survey of the question and of the interests.
involved, and keen imagination which enable the ques-
tioner to see all the possibilities of a case. It is a
cautious good judgment that prevents him from assum-
ing that to be true which he only imagines may be
true, and professional self-restraint that enables him to
pass by all opportunities which may give a witness a
chance for successful fencing."157/1

In the search for the probable it is often wise to use
questions that serve for little more than a _suggestion_ of
the desired point. Sir James Scarlett used to allow the
jurors and even the judges to discover for themselves
the best parts of his case. It flattered their vanity.
Scarlett went upon the theory, he tells us in the frag-
ments of his autobiography which were completed before
his death, that whatever strikes the mind of a juror as
the result of his own observation and discovery makes
always the strongest impression upon him, and the juror
holds on to his own discovery with the greatest tenacity
and often, possibly, to the exclusion of every other fact
in the case.

This search for probabilities, however, is a hazardous
occupation for the inexperienced. There is very great
danger of bringing out some incidental circumstance
that serves only to confirm or corroborate the state-
ments of a witness made before the cross-examination
began. Thus one not only stumbles upon a new circum-
stance in favor of his opponent, but the fact that it came
to light during the cross-examination instead of in the.
direct multiplies its importance in the eyes of a jury;
for it has often been said, and it is a well-recognized
fact, that accidental testimony always makes a greater
impression on a juror's mind than that deliberately and
designedly given.

157/1 Austin Abbott, Esq., in _The Daily Register_, December, 1886.

Another danger in this hazardous method of cross-
examination is the development of such a mass of
material that the minds of the jurors become choked
and unable to follow intelligently. If one cannot make
his points stand out clearly during his cross-examination,
he had better keep his seat. It used to be said of Law, a
famous English barrister, that “he wielded a huge two-
handed sword to extract a fly from a spider's web."

At the end of a long but unsuccessful cross-examina-
tion of a plaintiff, the kind we have been discussing,
an inexperienced trial lawyer once remarked rather
testily, “Well, Mr. Whittemore, you have contrived to
manage your case pretty well." Thank you, coun-
sellor," replied the witness, with a twinkle in his eye,
"perhaps I might return the compliment if I were not
testifying under oath.”

It so frequently happens that a lawyer who has made
a failure of his cross-examination accentuates that
failure by a careless side remark, instead of a dignified
retreat, that I cannot refrain from relating another anec-
dote, in this connection, to illustrate the danger of such
side remarks; for I am of the opinion that there is no
surer way to avoid such occurrences than to have ever
present in one's mind the mistakes of others.

One of the most distinguished practitioners in the
criminal courts of the city of Philadelphia was prose-
cuting a case for the government. His witnesses had
been subjected to a very vehement cross-examination
by the counsel for the prisoner, but with very little
effect upon the jury. Counsel for the prisoner resumed
his seat quietly, recognizing his failure, but content to
wait for another opportunity. After the testimony for
the state had closed, the prosecuting attorney arose and
foolishly remarked, Now, Mr. Ingraham, I give you
fair warning, after the way you have treated my wit-
nesses, I intend to handle your witnesses _without gloves_."
“That is more than any one would care to do with
yours, my friend," replied Mr. Ingraham; and the dirt
seemed, somehow, to stick to the state witnesses through-
out the trial.

An excellent example of effective cross-examination
to the circumstances surrounding the main question in a
case--- the genuineness of a signature ---will be found in
Bigelow's "Bench and Bar." The issue was the forgery
of a will; the proponent was a man of high respecta-
bility and good social standing, who had an indirect
interest to a large amount, if the will, as offered, was
allowed to be probated. Samuel Warren, the author
of "Ten Thousand a Year," conducted the cross-
examination.

_Warren_ (_placing his thumb over the seal_ and hold-
ing up the will). “I understand you to say you saw the
testator sign this instrument?"

_Witness_. "I did."

_Warren_. "And did you sign it at his request, as sub-
scribing witness?"

_Witness_. “I did."

_Warren_. "Was it sealed with red or black wax?

_Witness_. "With red wax."

_Warren_. "Did you see him seal it with red wax?"

_Witness_. "I did."

_Warren_. "Where was the testator when he signed
and sealed this will?"

_Witness_. "In his bed."

_Warren_. "Pray, how long a piece of red wax did he
use?"

_Witness_. "About three inches long."

_Warren_. "And who gave the testator this piece of
wax?"

_Witness_. "I did."

_Warren_. "Where did you get it?"

_Witness_. "From the drawer of his desk."

_Warren_. “How did he melt that piece of wax?"

_Witness_. "With a candle."

_Warren_. "Where did the candle come from?"

_Witness_. "I got it out of a cupboard in the room."

_Warren_. "How long should you say the candle was?

_Witness_. "Perhaps four or five inches long."

_Warren_. "Do you remember who lit the candle?"

_Witness_. "I lit it.”

_Warren_. "What did you light it with?"

_Witness_. "Why, with a match."

_Warren_. "Where did you get the match?'

_Witness_. "On the mantel-shelf in the room."

Here Mr. Warren paused, and fixing his eye upon the
prisoner, he again held up the will, his thumb still resting
upon the seal, and said in a solemn, measured tone:---

_Warren_. "Now, sir, upon your solemn oath, you saw
the testator sign this will --- he signed it in his bed-at
his request you signed it as a subscribing witness - you
saw him seal it---it was with red wax he sealed it---a
piece of wax about three inches long --- he lit the wax
with a piece of candle which you procured from a cup-
board you ---lit the candle with a match which you
found on a mantel-shelf?"

_Witness_. "I did."

_Warren_. Once more, sir--- upon your solemn oath,
you did?"

_Witness_. "I did.”

_Warren_. "My lord, you will observe this will is sealed
with a wafer!"

In “Irish Wit and Humor" there is given an illustra-
tion of the dexterity of Daniel O'Connell in bringing
about his client's acquittal by a very simple ruse of
cross-examination.

O'Connell was employed in defending a prisoner who
was tried for a murder committed in the vicinity of Cork.
The principal witness swore strongly against the prisoner
---one corroborative circumstance was that the prisoner's
hat was found near the place where the murder was
committed. The witness swore positively that the hat
produced was the one found, and that it belonged to the
prisoner, whose first name was James.

_O'Connell_. "By virtue of your oath, are you positive
that this is the same hat?

_Witness_. "I am."

_O'Connell_. Did you examine it carefully before you
swore in your information that it was the property of
the prisoner?"

_Witness_. "I did."

_O'Connell_ (taking up the hat and examining the
inside carefully, at the same time spelling aloud the name
"James "). Now let me see ---'J-A-M-E-S'--- do you
mean those letters were in the hat when you found it?"

_Witness_. "I do."

_O'Connell_. "Did you see them there?"

_Witness_. "I did."

_O'Connell_. And you are sure this is the same hat?"

_Witness_. "I am sure."

_O'Connell_ (holding up the hat to the Bench). Now.
my lord, I submit this is an end of this case. There is
no name whatever inscribed in this hat!"

Akin to the effect produced upon a jury by the prob-
abilities in a case is the _personal conviction_ of the law-
yer who is conducting it. A man who genuinely and
thoroughly believes in his own case will make others
agree with him, often though he may be in the wrong.

Rufus Choate once said, "I care not how hard the
case is--- it may bristle with difficulties--- if I _feel_ I am
on the right side, that case I win."

It is this personal consciousness of right that has a
strong moral and mental effect upon one's hearers. In
no way can a lawyer more readily communicate to the
minds of the jury his personal belief in his case than in
his method and manner of developing, throughout his
examinations, the probability or improbability of the
tale which is being unfolded to them. In fact, it is only
through his examinations of the witnesses and general
conduct of the trial, and his own personal deportment,
that a lawyer is justified in impressing upon the jury his
individual belief regarding the issues in the case. The
expression in words of a lawyer's opinion is not only
considered unprofessional, but produces an entirely
different effect upon a juror from the influence which
comes from earnestness and the profound conviction of
the righteousness of the cause advocated.

Writing upon this branch of the subject, Senator
Hoar says:164/1 "It is not a lawyer's duty or his right to
express his individual opinion. On him the respon-
sibility of the decision does not rest. He not only
has no right to accompany the statement of his argu-
ment with any assertion as to his individual belief,
but I think the most experienced observers win agree
that such expressions, if habitual, tend to diminish and
not to increase the just influence of the lawyer....
There never was a weightier advocate before New
England juries than Daniel Webster. Yet it is on
record that he always carefully abstained from any posi-
tiveness of assertion. He introduced his weightiest
arguments with such phrases as, 'It will be for the
jury to consider,' 'It may, perhaps, be worth thinking
of, gentlemen,' or some equivalent phrase, by which he
kept scrupulously off the ground which belonged to
the tribunal he was addressing."

But an advocate is justified in arousing in the minds
of a jury all the excitement which he feels about the
case himself. If he feels he is in the right, he can show
it in a hundred different ways which cannot fail to have
their effect upon his hearers. It was Gladstone's pro-
found seriousness that most impressed itself upon every-
thing that he said. He always made the impression
upon his hearers that the matter he was discussing was
that upon which the foundations of heaven and earth
rested. Rufus Choate's _heart_ was always in the court-
house. "No gambler ever hankered for the feverish
delight of the gaming-table as Choate did for the ab-
sorbing game, half-chance, half-skill, where twelve
human dice must all turn up together one way, or there
is no victory.. It was a curious sight to see on
a jury twelve hard-headed and intelligent countrymen---
farmers, town officers, trustees, men chosen by their
neighbors to transact their important affairs ---after an
argument by some clear-headed lawyer for the defence
about some apparently not very doubtful transaction,
who had brought them all to his way of thinking, and
had warned them against the wiles of the charmer, when
Choate rose to reply for the plaintiff ---to see their look
of confidence and disdain---'You needn't try your wiles
upon me.' The shoulder turned a little against the
speaker---- the averted eye---and then the change; first,
the changed posture of the body; the slight opening of
the mouth; then the look, first, of curiosity, and then
of doubt, then of respect; the surrender of the
eye of the great advocate; then the spell, the charm, the
great enchantment --- till at last, jury and audience were
all swept away, and followed the conqueror captive in
his triumphal march."165/1

164/1 "Autobiography of Seventy Years."

Sir James Scarlett, England's greatest verdict getter,
always had an appearance of confidence in himself and
his cause which begot a feeling of confidence in all who
listened to him. He used to "wind himself into a case
like a great serpent." He always had about him a
happy mixture of sparkling intelligence and good
nature, which told amazingly with juries." A writer in
the _Britannia_ gives the following graphic description.
of Scarlett's appearance in court: "A spectator unac-
quainted with the courts might have supposed that
anybody rather than the portly, full-faced, florid man,
who was taking his ease on the comfortable cushions of
the front row, was the counsel engaged in the cause.
Or if he saw him rise and cross-examine a witness, he
would be apt to think him certainly too indolent to
attend properly to his business, so cool, indifferent, and
apparently unconcerned was the way in which the facts
which his questions elicited were left to their fate, as
though it were of no consequence whether they were
attended to or not. Ten to one with him that the plain-
tiff's counsel would get the verdict, so clear seemed the
case and so slight the opposition. But in the course of
time the defendant's turn would come; and then the
large-headed, ruddy-faced, easy-going advocate would
rise slowly from his seat, not standing quite upright, but
resting on his left hand placed upon the bar, and turning
sideways to the jury to commence the defence of his
client. Still the same unpretending _nonchalant_ air was
continued; it almost seemed too great an exertion to
speak; the chin of that ample face rested upon the still
more ample chest as though the motion of the lips alone
would be enough for all that might have to be said. So
much for the first impression. A few moments´ reflec.
tion sufficed to dispel the idea that indolence had any-
thing to do with the previous quiescence of the speaker.
Now it became clear that all the while he seemed to
have been taking his ease bodily, he had been using his
powers of observation and his understanding. That
keen gray eye had not stolen glances at the jury, nor at
the witnesses either, for nothing. Nor had those aban-
doned facts, drawn out in cross-examination, been un-
fruitful seeds or cast in barren places. Low as the tone
of voice was, it was clear and distinct. It was not a
mere organ of sound, but a medium of communication
between the mind of the advocate and the minds of the
jury. Sir James Scarlett did not attempt, like Denman
or Brougham, to carry the feelings of a jury by storm
before a torrent of invective or of eloquence; nor was
there any obvious sophistry, such as occupied too large
a space in the speeches of Campbell or Wilde; it was
with facts ---admitted, omitted or slurred over, as best
suited his purpose ---and with inferences made obvious
in spite of prepossessions created by the other side, that
this remarkable advocate achieved his triumphs."

165/1 "Autobiography of Seventy Years," Hoar.


Personal magnetism is, perhaps, the most important
of all the attributes of a good trial lawyer. Those
who possess it never fully realize it themselves and
only partially, perhaps, when under the influence of a
large audience. There is nothing like an audience as
a stimulant to every faculty. The cross-examiner's
questions seem to be vitalized with his knowl-
edge of the topic of inquiry and his own shrewd dis-
cernment of the situation of the witness and the relation
which the witness's interest and feelings bear to the
topic. His force becomes almost irresistible, but it is
a force in questions, a force aroused in the mind of
the witness, not in the voice of the questioner. He
seems to be able to concentrate all the attention of
his hearers upon the vital points in the case; he im-
parts weight and solidity to all he touches; he uncon-
sciously elevates the merits of his case; he comes
almost intuitively to perceive the elements of truth or
falsehood in the face itself of the narrative, without
any regard to the narrator, and new and undreamed-of
avenues of attacking the testimony seem to spring into
being almost with the force of inspiration.

Such is the life and such the experiences of the
trial lawyer. But I cannot leave this branch of the
subject without one sentiment in behalf of the witness,
as distinguished from the lawyer, by quoting the fol-
lowing amusing lamentation, which has found its way
into public print:---

>Of all unfortunate people in this world, none are
more entitled to sympathy and commiseration than
those whom circumstances oblige to appear upon the
witness-stand in court. You are called to the stand
and place your hand upon a copy of the Scriptures in
sheepskin binding, with a cross on the one side and
none on the other, to accommodate either variety of
the Christian faith. You are then arraigned before
two legal gentlemen, one of whom smiles at you
blandly because you are on his side, the other eying
you savagely for the opposite reason. The gentleman
who smiles, proceeds to pump you of all you know; and
having squeezed all he wants out of you, hands you over
to the other, who proceeds to show you that you are
entirely mistaken in all your suppositions; that you
never saw anything you have sworn to; that you
never saw the defendant in your life; in short, that
you have committed direct perjury. He wants to
know if you have ever been in state prison, and
takes your denial with the air of a man who thinks
you ought to have been there, asking all the questions
over again in different ways; and tells you with an
awe-inspiring severity, to be very careful what you
say. He wants to know if he understood you to say
so and so, and also wants to know whether you meant
something else. Having bullied and scared you out
of your wits, and convicted you in the eye of the jury
of prevarication, he lets you go. By and by everybody
you have fallen out with is put on the stand to swear
that you are the biggest scoundrel they ever knew,
and not to be believed under oath. Then the oppos-
ing counsel, in summing up, paints your moral photo-
graph to the jury as a character fit to be handed
down to time as the type of infamy---as a man who
has conspired against innocence and virtue, and stood
convicted of the attempt. The judge in his charge
tells the jury if they believe your testimony, etc.,
indicating that there is even a _judicial_ doubt of your
veracity; and you go home to your wife and family,
neighbors and acquaintances, a suspected man --- all be-
cause of your accidental presence on an unfortunate
occasion!
