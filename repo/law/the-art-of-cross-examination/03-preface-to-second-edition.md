## PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION

I PRESUME it is the experience of every author, after
his first book is published upon an important subject,
to be almost overwhelmed with a wealth of ideas and
illustrations which could readily have been included in
his book, and which to his own mind, at least, seem to
make a second edition inevitable. Such certainly was
the case with me; and when the first edition had
reached its sixth impression in five months, I rejoiced
to learn that it seemed to my publishers that the book
had met with a sufficiently favorable reception to justify
a second and considerably enlarged edition.

The book has practically been rewritten, so impor-
tant are the additions, although the first few chapters
have been left very much as they were.

The chapter on the "Cross-examination of Experts "
has been rearranged, many new examples added, and
the discussion much extended.

There is a new chapter on "Cross-examination to the
Fallacies of Testimony," which is intended to be a brief
discussion of the philosophy of oral evidence.

There is also a new chapter on "Cross-examination
to Probabilities, --- Personality of the Examiner, etc.,”
with many instructive illustrations.

Perhaps one of the most entertaining additions is the
chapter devoted to “The Celebrated Breach of Promise
Case of Martinez _v._ Del Valle," in which one of Mr.
Joseph H. Choate's most subtle cross-examinations is
given at length, with explanatory annotations. This
case is placed first among the examples of celebrated
cross-examinations because of these annotations. They
are intended to guide the student and to indicate to
him some of the methods that are used by great cross-
examiners, in order that he may have a clearer under-
standing of the methods used in the cross-examinations
in the chapters that follow.

Extracts from the cross-examination of Guiteau, Presi-
dent Garfield's assassin, conducted by Mr. John K.
Porter, comprise another new chapter.

In the place of Mr. Choate's cross-examination of
Russell Sage in the third trial (extracts of which were
given in the first edition), the far more instructive and
amusing cross-examination that took place in the _second_
trial has been substituted.

Whatever in the first edition was merely amusing, or,
if instructive, was somewhat obscure, has been omitted;
so that quite one-half the present edition is entirely new
matter, and of a more serious character.

One important feature of the book is the fact that the
cases and illustrations are all _real_, and many of them
heretofore almost unknown to the profession. They have
not been intentionally misrepresented or exaggerated.

This new edition of my book is submitted with the
hope that my readers may take as much pleasure in its
perusal as I have done in the researches necessary to its
preparation.
