## PREFACE

In offering this book to the legal profession I do
not intend to arrogate to myself any superior knowledge
upon the subject, excepting in so far as it may have
been gleaned from actual experience. Nor have I
attempted to treat the subject in any scientific, elabo-
rate, or exhaustive way; but merely to make some
suggestions upon the art of cross-examination, which
have been gathered as a result of twenty-five years'
court practice, during which time I have examined and
cross-examined about fifteen thousand witnesses, drawn
from all classes of the community.

If what is here written affords anything of instruction
to the younger members of my profession, or of interest
or entertainment to the public, it will amply justify the
time taken from my summer vacation to put in readable
form some points from my experience upon this most
difficult subject.
