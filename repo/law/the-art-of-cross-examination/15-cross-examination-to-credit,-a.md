## CROSS-EXAMINATION TO CREDIT, AND ITS ABUSES

The preceding chapters have been devoted to the
legitimate uses of cross-examination ---the development
of truth and exposure of fraud.

Cross-examination as to credit has also its legitimate
use to accomplish the same end; but this powerful
weapon for good has almost equal possibilities for evil.
It is proposed in the present chapter to demonstrate
that cross-examination as to credit should be exercised
with great care and caution, and also to discuss some
of the abuses of cross-examination by attorneys, under
the guise and plea of cross-examination as to credit.

Questions which throw no light upon the real issues.
in the case, nor upon the integrity or credit of the
witness under examination, but which expose misdeeds,
perhaps long since repented of and lived down, are
often put for the sole purpose of causing humiliation and
disgrace. Such inquiries into private life, private affairs,
or domestic infelicities, perhaps involving innocent per-
sons who have nothing to do with the particular litiga-
tion and who have no opportunity for explanation nor
means of redress, form no legitimate part of the cross-
examiner's art. The lawyer who allows himself to
become the mouthpiece of the spite or revenge of his
client may inflict untold suffering and unwarranted tor-
ture. Such questions may be within the legal rights of
counsel in certain instances, but the lawyer who allows
himself to be led astray by his zeal or by the solicitations
of his client, at his elbow, ready to make any sacrifice to
humiliate his adversary, thereby debauches his profession
and surrenders his self-respect, for which an occasional
verdict, won from an impressionable jury by such
methods, is a poor recompense.

To warrant an investigation into matters irrelevant to
the main issues in the case, and calculated to disgrace
the witness or prejudice him in the eyes of the jury, they
must at least be such as tend to impeach his general
moral character and his credibility as a witness. There
can be no sanction for questions that tend simply to
degrade the witness personally, and which can have no
possible bearing upon his veracity.

In all that has preceded we have gone upon the pre-
sumption that the cross-examiner's art would be used to
further his client's cause by all fair and legitimate means,
not by misrepresentation, insinuation, or by knowingly
putting a witness in a false light before a jury. These
methods doubtless succeed at times, but he who practises
them acquires the reputation, with astounding rapidity,
of being “smart," and finds himself discredited not only
with the court, but in some almost unaccountable way,
with the very juries before whom he appears. Let him
once get the reputation of being “unfair " among the
habitués of the court-house, and his usefulness to clients
as a trial lawyer is gone forever. Honesty is the best
policy quite as much with the advocate as in any of the
walks of life.

Counsel may have in his possession material for injuring
the witness, but the propriety of using it often becomes
a serious question even in cases where its use is otherwise
perfectly legitimate. An outrage to the feelings of a
witness may be quickly resented by a jury, and sympathy
take the place of disgust. Then, too, one has to reckon
with the judge, and the indignation of a strong judge is
not wisely provoked. Nothing could be more unprofes-
sional than for counsel to ask questions which disgrace
not only the witness, but a host of innocent persons, for
the mere reason that the client wishes them to be
asked.

There could be no better example of the folly of yield-
ing to a client's hatred or desire for revenge than the
outcome of the famous case in which Mrs. Edwin For-
rest was granted a divorce against her husband, the dis-
tinguished tragedian. Mrs. Forrest, a lady of culture
and refinement, demanded her divorce upon the ground
of adultery, and her husband had made counter-charges
against her. At the trial (1851) Charles O'Connor,
counsel for Mrs. Forrest, called as his first witness the
husband himself, and asked him concerning his infideli-
ties in connection with a certain actress. John Van
Buren, who appeared for Edwin Forrest, objected to the
question on the ground that it required his client to
testify to matters that might incriminate him. The
question was not allowed, and the husband left the wit-
ness-stand. After calling a few unimportant witnesses,
O'Connor rested the case for plaintiff without having
elicited any tangible proof against the husband. Had
a motion to take the case from the jury been made at
this time, it would of necessity have been granted, and
the wife's suit would have failed. It is said that when
Mr. Van Buren was about to make such a motion and
end the case, Mr. Forrest directed him to proceed with
the testimony for the defence, and develop the nauseating
evidence he had accumulated against his wife. Van
Buren yielded to his client's wishes, and for days and
weeks continued to call witness after witness to the
disgusting details of Mrs. Forrest's alleged debauchery.
The case attracted great public attention and was widely
reported by the newspapers. The public, as so often
happens, took the opposite view of the evidence from the
one the husband had anticipated. Its very revolting
character aroused universal sympathy on the wife's be-
half. Mr. O'Connor soon found himself flooded with
offers of evidence, anonymous and otherwise, against the
husband, and when Van Buren finally closed his attack
upon the wife, O'Connor was enabled, in rebuttal, to
bring such an avalanche of convincing testimony against
the defendant that the jury promptly exonerated Mrs.
Forrest and granted her the divorce. At the end of the
first day's trial the case could have been decided in favor
of the husband, had a simple motion to that effect been
made; but, yielding to his client's hatred of his wife, and
after a hard-fought trial of thirty-three days, Mr. Van
Buren found both himself and his client ignominiously
defeated. This error of Mr. Van Buren's was widely
commented on by the profession at the time. He had
but lately resigned his office at Albany as attorney gen-
eral, and up to the time of this trial had acquired no little
prestige in his practice in the city of New York, which,
however, he never seemed to regain after his fatal blunder
in the Forrest divorce case.175/1

The abuse of cross-examination has been widely dis-
cussed in England in recent years, partly in consequence
of the cross-examination of a Mrs. Bravo, whose hus-
band had died by poison. He had lived unhappily with
her on account of the attentions of a certain physician.
During the inquiry into the circumstances of her hus-
band's death, the story of the wife's intrigue was made
public through her cross-examination. Sir Charles Rus-
sell, who was then regarded as standing at the head of
the Bar, both in the extent of his business and in his
success in court, and Sir Edward Clark, one of her
Majesty's law officers, with a high reputation for ability
in jury trials, were severely criticised as "forensic bul-
lies," and complained of as “lending the authority of
their example to the abuse of cross-examination to credit
which was quickly followed by barristers of inferior posi-
tions, among whom the practice was spreading of assail-
ing witnesses with what was not unfairly called a system
of innuendoes, suggestions, and bullying from which
sensitive persons recoil." And Mr. Charles Gill, one
of the many imitators of Russell's domineering style,
was criticised as "bettering the instructions of his elders."

175/1" Extraordinary Cases," H. L. Clinton.


The complaint against Russell was that by his prac-
tices as displayed in the Osborne case---robbery of
jewels --- not only may a man's, or a woman's, whole
past be laid bare to malignant comment and public
curiosity, but there is no means afforded by the courts
of showing how the facts really stood or of producing
evidence to repel the damaging charges.

Lord Bramwell, in an article published originally in
_Nineteenth Century_ for February, 1892, and republished
in legal periodicals all over the world, strongly defends
the methods of Sir Charles Russell and his imitators.
Lord Bramwell claimed to speak after an experience of
forty-seven years' practice at the Bar and on the bench,
and long acquaintance with the legal profession.

"A judge's sentence for a crime, however much re-
pented of, is not the only punishment; there is the con-
sequent loss of character in addition, which should
confront such a person whenever called to the witness-
stand." "Women who carry on illicit intercourse, and
whose husbands die of poison, must not complain at
having the veil that ordinarily screens a woman's life
from public inquiry rudely torn aside." "It is well for
the sake of truth that there should be a wholesome dread
of cross-examination." "It should not be understood to
be a trivial matter, but rather looked upon as a trying
ordeal." "None but the sore feel the probe." Such
were some of the many arguments of the various up-
holders of broad license in examinations to credit.

Lord Chief Justice Cockburn took the opposite view
of the question. "I deeply deplore that members of the
Bar so frequently unnecessarily put questions affecting
the private life of witnesses, which are only justifiable
when they challenge the credibility of a witness. I
have watched closely the administration of justice in
France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Italy, and a little
in Spain, as well as in the United States, in Canada,
and in Ireland, and in no place have I seen witnesses
so badgered, browbeaten, and in every way so brutally
maltreated as in England. The way in which we treat
our witnesses is a national disgrace and a serious obstacle,
instead of aiding the ends of justice. In England the
most honorable and conscientious men loathe the wit-
ness-box. Men and women of all ranks shrink with
terror from subjecting themselves to the wanton
insult and bullying misnamed cross-examination in our
English courts. Watch the tremor that passes the
frames of many persons as they enter the witness-box.
I remember to have seen so distinguished a man as the
late Sir Benjamin Brodie shiver as he entered the wit-
ness-box. I daresay his apprehension amounted to
exquisite torture. Witnesses are just as necessary for
the administration of justice as judges or jurymen, and
are entitled to be treated with the same consideration,
and their affairs and private lives ought to be held as
sacred from the gaze of the public as those of the
judges or the jurymen. I venture to think that it is
the duty of a judge to allow no questions to be put to
a witness, unless such as are clearly pertinent to the
issue before the court, except where the credibility of
the witness is deliberately challenged by counsel and
that the credibility of a witness should not be wantonly
challenged on slight grounds."178/1

The propriety or impropriety of questions to credit is
of course largely addressed to the discretion of the court.
Such questions are generally held to be fair when, if the
imputation they convey be true, the opinion of the court
would be seriously affected as to the credibility of the
witness on the matter to which he testifies; they are
unfair when the imputation refers to matters so remote
in time, or of such character that its truth would not
affect the opinion of the court; or if there be a great
disproportion between the importance of the imputa-
tion and the importance of the witness's evidence.178/2

A judge, however, to whose discretion such questions
are addressed in the first instance, can have but an imper-
fect knowledge of either side of the case before him. He
cannot always be sure, without hearing all the facts,
whether the questions asked would or would not tend
to develop the truth rather than simply degrade the
witness. Then, again, the mischief is often done by the
mere asking of the question, even if the judge directs
the witness not to answer. The insinuation has been
made publicly ---the dirt has been thrown. The dis-
cretion must therefore after all be largely left to the
lawyer himself. He is bound in honor, and out of respect
to his profession, to consider whether the question ought
in conscience to be asked ---whether in his own honest
judgment it renders the witness unworthy of belief under
oath --- before he allows himself to ask it. It is much
safer, for example, to proceed upon the principle that the
relations between the sexes has no bearing whatever
upon the probability of the witness telling the truth,
unless in the extreme case of an abandoned woman.

178/2 Sir James Stephen's Evidence Act.


In criminal prosecutions the district attorney is
usually regarded by the jury much in the light of a
judicial officer and, as such, unprejudiced and impartial.
Any slur or suggestion adverse to a prisoner's witness
coming from this source, therefore, has an added power
for evil, and is calculated to do injustice to the defend-
ant. There have been many flagrant abuses of this
character in the criminal courts of our own city. "Is
it not a fact that you were not there at all?" Has all
this been written out for you?” "Is it not a fact that
you and your husband have concocted this whole
story?" "You have been a witness for your husband
in every lawsuit he has had, have you not? --- were all
questions that were recently criticised by the court, on
appeal, as "innuendo," and calculated to prejudice the
defendant ---by the Michigan Supreme Court in the
People _vs._ Cahoon --- and held sufficient, in connection
with other similar errors, to set the conviction aside.

Assuming that the material with which you propose
to assail the credibility of a witness fully justifies the
attack, the question then arises, How to use this material
to the best advantage? The sympathies of juries are
keen toward those obliged to confess their crimes on the
witness-stand. The same matters may be handled to
the advantage or positive disadvantage of the cross-
examiner. If you hold in your possession the evidence
of the witness's conviction, for example, but allow him
to understand that you know his history, he will surely
get the better of you. Conceal it from him, and he
will likely try to conceal it from you, or lie about it
if necessary. "I don't suppose you have ever been in
trouble, have you?" will bring a quick reply, “What
trouble?"--- "Oh, I can't refer to any particular trouble.
I mean generally, have you ever been in jail?" The
witness will believe you know nothing about him and
deny it, or if he has been many times convicted, will
admit some small offence and attempt to conceal every.
thing but what he suspects you know already about him.
This very attempt to deceive, if exposed, will destroy
him with the jury far more effectually than the knowl-
edge of the offences he has committed. On the other
hand, suppose you taunt him with his crime in the first
instance; ten to one he will admit his wrong-doing in
such a way as to arouse toward himself the sympathy
of the jury and their resentment toward the lawyer
who was unchristian enough to uncover to public view
offences long since forgotten.

Chief Baron Pollock once presided at a case where
a witness was asked about a conviction years gone by,
though his (the witness's) honesty was not doubted. The
baron burst into tears at the answer of the witness.

In the Bellevue Hospital case (the details of which are
fully described in a subsequent chapter), and during the
cross-examination of the witness Chambers, who was con-
fined in the Pavilion for the Insane at the time, the writer
was imprudent enough to ask the witness to explain to
the jury how he came to be confined on Ward's Island,
only to receive the pathetic reply: "I was sent there
because I was insane. You see my wife was very ill with
locomotor ataxia. She had been ill a year; I was her only
nurse. I tended her day and night. We loved each other
dearly. I was greatly worried over her long illness and
frightful suffering. The result was, I worried too deeply;
she had been very good to me. I overstrained myself,
my mind gave way; but I am better now, thank you."
