# Trade and Commerce

My last subject is 'Trade, Commerce and Intercourse'. The title was
obviously taken from Australia, where the Constitution provides that
'trade, commerce and intercourse shall be absolutely free'. The judicial
decisions on this famous --- or notorious --- section 92 of the Commonwealth
Constitution demonstrate how complicated is the simplest constitutional
provision. Eminent Australian authorities who have tried to discover
some principle behind the decisions of the High Court and the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council say that they no longer understand what
the section means. Perhaps they never did: for as every lecturer or
examiner --- or, for that matter, examinee --- knows, there is nothing like
a good phrase to hide a complete lack of understanding. If a phrase is
wanted, it is not difficult to find one. 'Absolutely free' means
'relatively free'. The Indian Constituent Assembly seems to have adopted
that view from the beginning.

Article 301 starts with the draftsman's magic formula: 'Subject to the
other provisions of this Part.' It goes on to say that 'trade, commerce
and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free'; not
absolutely free or even relatively free, but just free. Article 302 then
makes plain that, so far as the Union Parliament is concerned, it need
not be free at all. Parliament may by law impose such restrictions on
the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one State and
another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required
in the 'public interest'. Who is going to decide whether it is required in
the 'public interest'? Though the matter is not free from doubt, it would
seem that the task must fall upon the courts. If this interpretation is
correct, the provision will be productive of lawyers' fees. It may be
doubted, too, whether 'the public interest' is a concept easily
reducible to legal formulae, though admittedly something of the sort
happens with 'public policy'.

The major element of doubt in this interpretation arises from the
extremely vague language of article 307. Parliament may by law appoint
such authority as it thinks appropriate for carrying out the purposes of
articles 301, 302, etc., and confer on the authority so appointed such
powers and such duties as it thinks necessary. No doubt the Constituent
Assembly had in mind the Inter-State Commerce Commission of the United
States. If it is sought to give such a body judicial powers, article 131
would no doubt be invoked. Under it, the Supreme Court, 'subject to the
provisions of this Constitution', has exclusive _original jurisdiction_ in
inter-State disputes. It is true that disputes under the commerce clause
need not be inter-State disputes. In Australia the Privy Council
obtained jurisdiction precisely because section 92 was a limitation on
the powers of the Commonwealth and the States and did not raise what the
Australians call an _inter se_[^inter-se] question. Nevertheless, the Privy Council
has held in the Banking Case that the nationalization of the banks did
involve a dispute between the Commonwealth and the States and so vested
exclusive jurisdiction in the High Court.

[^inter-se]: Between one another, each other; together, mutually.

Moreover, a plausible argument can be raised on the language of articles
302 and 307 itself. Parliament can, if would seem, confer power under
article 307 only by means of a valid law. If the Supreme Court declares
that an Act of Parliament is invalid under Article 302 because it is not
'required in the public interest', the power conferred under article 307
disappears. Hence the Supreme Court, and not the body appointed under
article 307, must decide whether an Act is 'required in the public
interest'.

Articles 301 and 302 do not, however, stand alone. Having said in
article 301 that 'trade, commerce and intercourse ... shall be free',
and qualified that statement in article 302 by saying in effect that
trade, commerce and industry shall not be free if the Union Parliament
passes an Act which is 'required in the public interest', the Constituent
Assembly has provided in article 303 (1) that neither Parliament nor the
Legislature of a State shall have power to make any law giving, or
authorizing the giving of, any preference to one State over another, or
making, or authorizing the making of, any discrimination between one
State and another, by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce
in any of the lists of the Seventh Schedule.

In so far as this applies to the Union Parliament, it must be read
subject to clause (2) of the same article, which provides that nothing
in clause (1) shall prevent Parliament from making any law giving, or
authorizing the giving of, any preference, or making, or authorizing the
making of, any discrimination if it is declared by law that it is
necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing with the situation arising
from scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India.

This sort of drafting is the despair of the lawyer. The question of the
validity of an Act of the Union Parliament relating to trade, commerce
or intercourse depends upon the answers to the following questions:

1. Does it fall within the Union List or the Concurrent List of the
   Seventh Schedule? This is in itself not a simple question, because
   'trade, commerce and intercourse' is not an item of either list.
   Trade and commerce will normally fall within items 41 and 42 of the
   Union List, but intercourse is a vague term covering a multiplicity
   of relationships.
2. If the answer to question (1) is in the affirmative, does the Act
   interfere with the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse under
   article 301?
3. If the answer to question (2) is in the affirmative, does the Act
   fall within article 302, which allows a restriction on the freedom
   of trade, commerce and intercourse if it is 'required in the public
   interest'?
4. If the answer to question (3) is in the affirmative, is the law
   discriminatory in the sense of article 303 (1)?
5. If the answer to question (4) is in the affirmative, is it excepted
   under article 303 (2)? This is the easiest of the questions, because
   it depends on a recital in the Act itself and does not require a
   determination by the courts.

Where general phrases are used, as they are in the Indian Constitution,
the boundary between validity and invalidity can be determined only by
_case law_. If the High Court of Australia and the Privy Council have had
difficulty in determining the meaning of 'absolutely free', how much
more difficult is the task of the Indian courts, which have to determine
the meaning of 'free' in article 301, subject to the qualifications in
article 302, which is in turn subject to the qualification in article
303 (1).

The application of article 303 (2) to State Legislatures is even more
curious. Article 301 applies to State legislation as it applies to Union
legislation, though such legislation must in any case fall within the
State List or the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule. State
legislation which restricts the freedom of trade, commerce and
intercourse, even if valid under the Seventh Schedule, is invalid under
article 301. It would be interesting, for example, to ascertain what
authority the State of Madras has to forbid the importation of alcoholic
liquor. It would not be enough to provide by law that the possession of
such liquor was an offence, for if the possessor had brought it in under
article 301 any attempt to penalize him for being in possession would be
a colourable attempt to prevent him from bringing it in. At what point
possession would become unlawful is a matter which only the courts could
determine, but a person who brings in a case of whisky because trade,
commerce and intercourse are free would be wise to drink it as soon as
possible.

To this article 303 (1) adds a prohibition against discrimination. How a
State can discriminate when it has no power to make law at all is one of
those mysteries which seem to take us into the realm of the
supernatural. If the Madras State restricts importation from Orissa it
must also restrict importation from Mysore; but since it apparently has
no power to do either the point may be regarded as 'academic' in the
worst sense. It is clear that, in so far as it applies to State
legislation, article 303 (1) is not a qualification to article 301, but
an independent fetter on legislative power. Even more curious is article 304. At first sight, paragraph (a) appears to authorize an import duty
on goods imported from other States --- not, be it noted, from other
countries; thus Madras may impose a duty on goods from Orissa or Mysore,
but not from Pondicherry or Ceylon. It is, however, doubtful whether
entry 52 of the State List authorizes an import duty, and there is no
power in the Concurrent List. Paragraph (a) of article 304 probably
refers, therefore, to excise duties and sales taxes. If that is so, all
it means is that a sales tax on articles produced in Madras must not be
lower than the sales tax on goods imported from anywhere else in India,
though apparently it may be higher on goods imported from Ceylon.

We come next to paragraph (b) which authorizes 'such reasonable
restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse _with or
within the State_ as may be 'required in the public interest'. The
Legislature cannot interfere _with_ trade, intercourse or commerce with
the State except at the State boundaries. It can, therefore, impose
restrictions at the State frontier if they are 'reasonable' and are
'required in the public interest'. Apparently they may be unreasonable
and yet 'required in the public interest', or reasonable and yet 'not
required in the public interest'. What is meant by 'reasonable' and
'required in the public interest' is therefore a subject on which
lawyers, with the assistance of economists and sociologists, may argue
at length.

The questions to be asked about the validity of State legislation are
therefore the following:

1. Is it authorized by the State List or the Concurrent List of the
   Seventh Schedule?
2. If the answer is in the affirmative, does it obstruct the freedom of
   trade, commerce and intercourse under article 301?
3. If the answer to question (2) is in the negative, is it
   discriminating and therefore invalid under article 303 (1)?
4. If the answer to question (2) is in the affirmative, is the
   legislation nevertheless valid under article 304?
5. If the answer to question (4) is in the affirmative, is the
   legislation invalid under article 301 (1)?

This process of legislating by exception to an exception is not a happy
one. It may be noted, too, that in the process the Constituent Assembly
has forgotten to deal with the essence of the Australian problem. That
problem may be put by asking whether the freedom is at the State
frontier or anywhere within the State. Is it merely that the State (or
the Union) must not impede the flow of goods and persons over the
frontier, or is it prohibited from doing anything which interferes with
the flow of goods and persons throughout India? The phrasing of article
301 seems to suggest the latter interpretation; and that interpretation
has apparently been accepted in Australia, though only after much
litigation.

The new generation of Australian lawyers would like to get rid of
section 92 of their Constitution, which seems to them to be more trouble
than it is worth. It seems certain that in twenty years Indian lawyers
will be able to point out that the Australian lawyers do not know what
trouble is. Part XIII exhibits the major defect of the Indian
Constitution, a reluctance to trust the Legislatures combined with a
reluctance to allow the courts to engage in judicious law-making through
the interpretation of broad and general provisions. If nobody except the
Constituent Assembly can be trusted to make laws, why not make the laws
once for all and enact a one-clause Constitution: 'Nobody shall change
the laws of India'?
