# LIFE INSURANCE: THE ABUSES AND THE REMEDIES[^11/1]


[^11/1]: Delivered before the Commercial Club of Boston, October 26, 1905.

_Mr. President and Gentlemen_:---

Eight months ago dissension among guilty
officers of the Equitable Life Assurance Society
first directed public attention to the
conduct of the life insurance business. Since
then the disclosures of financial depravity have
aroused widespread indignation; but even now
the importance of the subject is not generally
realized.

## OUR HUGE LIFE INSURANCE INVESTMENT

On January 1, 1905, there were outstanding
in the ninety principal legal reserve or old line
life insurance companies of the United States
21,082,352 policies. By these policies the
lives of at least 10,000,000 of our people are
insured. As these policies were taken out
largely on the lives of husbands, intending to
provide for widow and children, it is estimated
that, on the average, more than four people
are interested in each life insured. So we
have in all about 40,000,000 people, nearly
one-half of the total population of the United
States, directly interested in the conduct of these
ninety companies. The aggregate amount of insurance
represented by these 21,082,352 policies
was $12,928,493,754. That sum is more
than the supposed value of all the steam railroads
in the United States which on June 30,
1904, was only $11,244,852,000. It is far more
than the par value of their aggregate bonds
and stocks held by the public, which was only
$9,585,467,711.

To provide for that insurance these companies
received during the year 1904 new
money in the form of premiums aggregating
$498,303,279. That is, more than the aggregate
interest and dividends paid on all bonds
and stocks of our steam railroads held by the
public, which, during the year ending June 30,
1904, was only $465,872,674.

On January 1, 1905, these ninety insurance
companies held assets aggregating $2,573,186,639.
That is, more than three times the
aggregate capital of all the 5,331 national
banks in the United States reporting June 30,
1904, which was only $767,378,148. The assets
of these insurance companies were nearly fourfifths
as large as the aggregate deposits in all
the national banks, which were only $3,312,439,841.

The total income of these insurance companies
during the year 1904, including returns
from investments, was $612,896,887. That
is, more than the total revenue of the United
States Government from all sources during
the year ending June 30, 1905, which was only
$543,423,859.24.

These figures, huge as they are, cover only a
part of the direct interest of the American
people in life insurance. Besides these ninety
legal reserve companies, there are in the United
States numberless assessment companies and
fraternal beneficiary societies which provide
life insurance. Their members are mainly
wage-earners who cannot pay the high premiums
exacted by the legal reserve companies.

But even the legal reserve companies insure
mainly persons of small means, performing
essentially the function of the savings bank.
The large company advertises with pride its
million dollar policies; but in 1904 the average
size of the policy in the Equitable was
$2,648; in the Mutual Life of New York,
$2,351; and in the New York Life, only $2,076.
In the Metropolitan and in the Prudential,
which join with the ordinary life insurance
business the specialty of insuring working
people, the average policy is only $183 and
$178 respectively. It will be seen therefore that
in spite of the large policies held by a few individuals,
the life insurance of this country is in
the main held by what we term "the people"
--- that large class which every system of business
and of government should seek to protect.

## THE COMPANIES' CONTROL OF QUICK CAPITAL

Such is the direct interest of our people in the
proper conduct of the life insurance business
--- the interest primarily of the home. Indirectly
the life insurance business affects our
industrial and political life no less vitally and
with perhaps even more far-reaching effects.
That influence results from the control which
the largest life insurance companies exercise
over our business and our political institutions
by means of the vast accumulation in a few
hands of the assets held as insurance reserve,
for deferred dividends or as surplus.

The aggregate assets of these ninety legal
reserve companies was, on January 1, 1905,
$2,573,186,639. Of that sum nearly one-half,
or $1,247,331,738, was held by the three leading
Wall Street companies, the Mutual Life of
New York, the Equitable and the New York
Life, not inaptly referred to as "The Big
Three" and the "Racers." One billion two
hundred and forty-seven million three hundred
and thirty-one thousand seven hundred
and thirty-eight dollars is a vast sum, but the
control exercised by these three companies
does not lie mainly in the size of the aggregate
assets. It results from their character and
from the conditions under which the funds are
held. The $1,247,331,738 in assets held by
these three Wall Street companies is a trifling
amount as compared with the aggregate wealth
of the country. What gives to the managers of
these and allied insurance companies the control
which they exercise over business is the
fact that the larger part of the aggregate assets
is quick capital. We have in the United States
many other great aggregations of assets: in
manufacturing, mining and commerce, the
Steel Trust, the Oil Trust, the Beef Trust;
in transportation, the Northern Pacific-Great
Northern combination, the Pennsylvania system
and the New York Central system. Even
in combinations like these our people recognize
a menace to our welfare and our institutions.
But between the vast combinations of capital
in manufacturing or transportation and the
accumulation of capital by the insurance companies
there is this marked difference - the
capital of the manufacturing, of the mining,
and of the railroad companies is, in the main,
permanently invested in lands, buildings or
machinery, in rails, bridges or equipment, or
it is required for operating their properties.
The capital of the life insurance companies, on
the other hand, is mainly free capital. The huge
manufacturing and transportation companies,
great and powerful as they are, are directly
dependent for their prosperity upon the prosperity
of the country and the service which
they render from day to day to the people.
Furthermore they are constant borrowers.

The situation of the life insurance companies
is entirely different. Except in respect to the
growth of their business, they are not dependent
for their prosperity upon that of the country.
Indeed, they derive certain benefits in times
of adversity. While the securities they already
hold are not of a class to be imperilled, they can
purchase new securities to better advantage.
They are the creditors of our great industries,
with all the power which that implies.

Of the aggregate capital of these three leading
life insurance companies there is invested
in real estate only 6.8%. The balance of
their assets is substantially quick capital. The
larger part of it is invested in bonds and stocks,
in collateral loans and money in bank. Moreover,
these three companies --- the Equitable,
the Mutual Life and the New York Life ---
have in important respects co-operated with
each other.

## OTHER QUICK CAPITAL LESS

Compared with their quick capital, that of the
great banking institutions of the country seems
insignificant. The three greatest New York
banks --- the National City, the Bank of Commerce
and the First National --- had on September
30, 1905, in capital and surplus together,
only $106,264,800. They had, it is true, in deposits
$421,521,900, an aggregate about as
large as the assets of a single one of these three
insurance companies.

But over their deposits these banks have
only a limited control. Twenty-five %
must always be held as a reserve. Besides, substantially
all deposits in banks and trust companies
are subject to check. This right of the
depositor to call for his money places a great
restraint upon the use which it is possible for
bank managers to make of the funds under
their control; and these insurance companies
are probably the largest depositors. On September
30, 1904, these three insurance companies
had deposited in banks and trust companies
$77,132,878. Such huge deposits secure
to the insurance companies an effectual control
over the banking institutions aside from the
actual control which they hold through ownership
of bank and trust company stocks.

The assets of the life insurance companies
are substantially in the absolute control of
the managers. Their officers know (except as
to new business) with mathematical certainty
approximately how much money they will be
required to pay out each month for years to
come; because the whole insurance business
rests upon stability in average death rates.
The insurance company may use most of its
capital without danger of its being called by
those for whom it is held.

Furthermore, while the amount of withdrawals
from the banks from time to time is substantially
equal to the deposits, the funds of
these insurance companies are increasing at an
alarming rate. To these three companies alone
there was actually paid in premiums and income
from investment in the year 1904, $254,870,441.37.
Only $111,161,905.25, or 43.61%, was paid out by them to the policyholders.
The balance (except $7,000) was used
either for expenses or accumulated for the
future. In the four years preceding January 1,
1905, the gross assets held by these three companies
increased $353,638,734.

The power of the financiers who control these
Wall Street companies is further increased by
close alliance with other life insurance companies.
The largest of these allied companies --- the Metropolitan
and the Prudential --- on January 1,
1905, had assets aggregating $216,659,984, and
their rate of accumulation is even greater than
that of the three leaders; for the Metropolitan
and the Prudential draw from a larger public,
mainly from the workingmen. In five years
the assets of these two companies have more
than doubled.

The "Big Three," with their lesser but powerful
allies, join together in syndicates to insure
the financing of the great manufacturing and
railroad combinations, and furnish the weapons
for our Napoleons of finance. The Northern
Securities Trust, Morgan's attempt to perfect
a monopoly of the railroads in the Northwest;
the International Mercantile Marine,
Morgan's attempt to monopolize a large part
of the shipping of the world; Harriman's and
Gould's ambitious plans --- are made possible
largely by the gathering of the savings of the
people in the treasuries of these five insurance
companies. How this financial community of
interests operates in even the routine business
of the companies may be seen from this: The
Equitable held on January 1, 1905, besides
$11,190,006 Government, State, City and
County bonds and $3,708,945 Russian railroad
securities (owned chiefly to comply with the
requirements of foreign governments), bonds and
stock of the aggregate cost of $192,849,290.
Of these securities $184,740,473 --- that is, all
but $8,108,817 (or four %) --- were of corporations
in which either one or more of the
directors of the Equitable were interested as
directors or which were parts of systems controlled
by such corporations.

When such facts are considered, it becomes
obvious why the financiers who control these
great insurance companies with their huge
quick capital exercise a predominating influence
over the business of the country. The
economic menace of past ages was the church
--- the dead hand, which gradually acquired a
large part of all available lands. The greatest
economic menace of to-day is a very live hand
--- these great insurance companies which are
controlling so large a part of our quick capital.

## HOW POWER ENTRUSTED WAS ABUSED

Such is the power which the American people
have intrusted to the managers of these large
companies. How has it been exercised? Substantially
as all irresponsible power since the
beginning of the world: selfishly, dishonestly,
and in the long run, inefficiently. The breaches
of trust committed or permitted by men of high
financial reputation, the disclosure of the payment
of exorbitant salaries and commissions,
the illegal participation in syndicate profits,
the persistent perversion of sacred trust funds
to political purposes, the co-operation of the
large New York companies to control the legislatures
of the country --- these disclosures are
indeed distressing; but the practice of deliberate
and persistent deception of the public
which the testimony discloses, though less dramatic,
is even more serious. Talleyrand said,
"Language was made to conceal thought."
George W. Perkins would teach us that "Bookkeeping
was made to conceal facts." Consider
for a moment his situation. An important
member of the most famous banking firm
in America, and next to the Rothschilds the
most famous in the world, confesses this:

The New York Life company, of which he is
the vice-president, held on December 31, 1903,
an investment taken through his firm, J. P.
Morgan & Co., of $4,000,000 in bonds of the
International Mercantile Marine. It was a
poor investment. It was deemed unwise to
make known to the insurance departments and
to present and prospective policy-holders the
fact that so large an investment in these unfortunate
securities was held by his company (and
doubtless also how much they had depreciated
in market value).

Perkins, the vice-president of the New York
Life company, and at the same time a member
of J. P. Morgan & Co., goes through the form
on December 31, 1903, of selling $800,000 of
these bonds to his firm at par, and then on January
2, 1904, re-transferring the same to the
insurance company at par and interest. This
was done in order that the officers of the company
might under oath present to the insurance
departments of the several States and
countries an official statement which would
show that the insurance company did not at
the close of the year 1903 hold as many of
these bonds as was the fact, and that the value
of those held was par (which was not the fact).

Again, Perkins confesses that in order to prevent
the company's exclusion from Prussia by
reason of holding among its investments a large
amount of stocks, entries were made in the
books of account showing a sale of these stocks.
The fact is that the stocks were not actually
sold, but that their ownership was concealed;
and that in order to account on the books for
the proceeds of this fake sale, two minor employees
of the company --- one of them a colored
messenger with a salary of $600 per year ---
were made to give their notes for $3,357,000
with the stock as collateral; and the notes
were then represented among the assets. The
original purpose of this elaborate system of
fraud may have been merely to deceive the
Prussian government; but with a degree of
thrift rare in the management of these companies,
it was used also to deceive our own insurance
commissioners and the policy-holders.
The New York Life had the effrontery up to
the time of Perkins's examination to declare
in extensive advertising that it held no stocks
whatever.

In the case of common criminals flight is
accepted as confession of guilt. With financiers
and business men falsification of books has
hitherto been considered the strongest evidence
of guilt. Yet the falsification of the books of
these companies has been a persistent practice.
Secret ledgers have been opened in which were
entered questionable investments and more
questionable expenditures. Hundreds of thousands
spent "for legislative purposes" were
charged up in real estate accounts. So elaborate
has been the system of fraudulent entries
that after months of investigation the particular
form of rascality embodied in the Equitable's
$685,000 Mercantile Trust Company,
so-called "yellow-dog," account has not yet
been detected.

The degree of guilt involved in such transactions
will be appreciated only when one remembers
that the life insurance business beyond
all other in the world rests upon confidence ---
confidence that in the remote, indefinite future
the present sacrifice of the policy-holder will
bring protection to widow and children.

## INEFFICIENCY IN MANAGEMENT

But the management of these companies has
been not only selfish and dishonest; it has also
been singularly inefficient; and it is by this inefficiency
that the policy-holders have actually
suffered most. The losses of policy-holders
through exorbitant salaries and syndicate operations,
though large in the aggregate, are small
as compared with the loss from bad management.
The test of success in the life insurance business
is of course to furnish insurance of absolute
safety at the minimum cost. The size of a life
insurance company is no evidence of success.
It is evidence of energy; it is evidence of business
skill; but the writing by the Mutual Life
of $1,578,931,833 of insurance and the control
of $442,061,529 in assets is, in itself, no more
evidence of success as an insurance company
than the display of a $12,00o rug in the office
of its president. In life insurance, success is
proved by a small _pro rata_ expense account, a
large percentage of return upon absolutely
safe investments and a small % of lapsed
and surrendered policies.

Now what is the record of the three largest
life insurance companies of the world in this
respect? Exclusive of taxes and fees, the percentage
of expense to total premium income for
1904 was this:

|
---- | --- :
New York Life|22.73%
Equitable|22.78%
Mutual Life|24.65%

These expense percentages are appalling; and
yet the companies which, besides issuing ordinary
life policies, make a specialty of insuring
the workingmen show an even greater %age
of expense to all premium receipts, namely:

|
---- | --- :
Metropolitan Life|37.09%
Prudential|37.28%

This Prudential Company, which advertises
itself as the Rock of Gibraltar, takes for its
officers and other management expenses on the
average of all business 37.28 cents for every
dollar which the policy-holders deposit with
it. On the industrial business, the workingman's
insurance, the percentage taken is even
larger. In addition, the company pays to stockholders
in dividends each year an equivalent
of 219.78% on the cash paid into the
company on the capital stock.

## SAVINGS BANKS BY CONTRAST

Compare these huge life insurance companies'
charges for managing savings with the cost
of running the Massachusetts savings banks.
There are in Massachusetts 188 savings banks
under the management of probably about
3,000 different individuals acting as trustees
without compensation. At the close of the financial
year, October 31, 1904, these banks held
assets aggregating $674,644,990.17, more than
half the aggregate held by the three largest life
insurance companies of the world. There had
been deposited in these 188 savings banks during
the year ending October 31, 1904, $105,466,148.68, an amount exceeding half the aggregate
of the year's premiums of these three companies
($206,132,511.44). The aggregate expense of
taking care of the business of these 188 savings
banks for the year 1904 was $1,546,904.44, or
less than one-thirtieth of the aggregate expense
of these three insurance companies ($48,106,809.00) for the year.

To manage the 188 Massachusetts savings
banks cost 23--100 of one % of the average
assets held during the year, or but 1.46%
of the year's deposits. To manage the three
large life insurance companies cost 4.03%
of their aggregate average assets and 23.33% of the year's premium income. That
is, the _pro rata_ cost of conducting the insurance
business and taking care of the savings
invested in these three insurance companies
was _seventeen times_ as great as the expense of
caring for savings invested in our 188 savings
banks.

Compare now the service rendered by these
two classes of savings institutions. The highpriced
insurance managers with their banking
and trust company adjuncts and high finance
directorates earned for their three companies
during the year 1904 the following gross return
on investments:

|
---- | --- :
New York Life|4.14%
Equitable|4.22%
Mutual Life|4.24%
_Average_|4.20%

The faithful treasurers of the 188 modest
Massachusetts savings banks, supervised mainly
by obscure but conscientious citizens, earned
during the year ending October 31, 1904, 4.40% on the average assets. The return earned
by our savings banks is thus five %
greater than that of the three insurance companies,
and a comparison of net returns is even
more favorable to the savings banks. I do not
say that the income returns of the great companies
manned by the great financiers was unreasonably
low, but merely that the small banks
with their low salaried officers earned more.

## LOSS THROUGH LAPSED POLICIES

The average rate of dividends actually paid
or credited to the depositors in our savings banks
for the year ending October 31, 1904, was 3.75% with interest compounded semi-annually,
and in 1904 no depositor in a Massachusetts
savings bank lost a dollar of the principal
deposited. On the other hand, the practice of
the insurance companies in relation to forfeiture
and surrender of policies has resulted in a large
percentage of the policy-holders losing a great
part of all they had paid in premiums.

The whole structure of life insurance rests
upon this postulate: while the duration of life
of any individual is uncertain, the average duration
of the lives of a large number is certain.
You cannot tell how long any one man of say
twenty-five years will live, but you can say
with certainty that the average age which any
thousand men of twenty-five years now living in
this country will attain is 63.81 years, and that
on the average they will die three and one-half
years later than another thousand who are
thirty years old. If each of these men wanted
$1,000 insurance payable at death --- the annual
premium for each --- (aside from the expense
of management) is that sum, which, invested
and compounded at the rate which it is
assumed the investment will pay (now taken as
low as 3½ % or 3%), will at the
end of 38.81 years yield $1,000. Now among
these 1,000 persons the number of deaths increases
each year. But under the level premium
system practised by the legal reserve
companies, the premium is always the same;
that is, in the earlier years the insured pays not
only a premium commensurate with the risk of
the year, but something on account of the
greater risk of future years. For instance, a
man at twenty-five pays a premium about
twice that which represents the risk of his dying
in that year.

Now, a life insurance policy by its terms is
usually forfeited unless full premiums are paid
for the first three years. Forfeited policies are
termed "lapsed" policies. The lapse of a policy
results in total loss to the insured of his premium,
except for the protection temporarily enjoyed.
The voluntary surrender of a policy after three
full years' premiums are paid results in a loss
of part of the premiums paid --- because the
companies pay on surrender only a fraction of
its actual legal reserve value (_e.g._, in 1904 the
Mutual Life paid on surrender only 63.15% of such value). Experience, especially in
these large companies, shows that the mortality
of life insurance policies is very much greater
than the mortality among policy-holders. The
life of an ordinary life policy is short, not because
life is short, but because most policies do
not come to their natural termination. Thus,
in the year 1904 the policies in the Mutual Life
which came to a natural termination by death,
maturity or expiry aggregated only 9,169 in
number and $28,278,464 in amount insured;
while 7,011 policies aggregating $16,896,941
were surrendered, and 33,215 policies aggregating
$74,909,054 lapsed.

Among the companies which make a specialty
of insuring workingmen, the mortality of the
policies is very much greater. In 1904, 116,894
of the Metropolitan Company's industrial policies
terminated by death and expiry; but
1,223,832 terminated by lapse and 61,220 by
surrender; that is, only one policy in twelve
came to a natural end. In the Prudential Company
the condition was even worse. There
82,963 terminated by death and expiry; 945,640
by lapse, and 45,361 by surrender; that is,
only one policy in thirteen came to a natural end.

## WHY POLICIES LAPSE

People who take out fire insurance policies
generally continue the insurance, although a
fire policy could be dropped after the term
without the insured losing anything, since the insured
has had his full protection. But in life
insurance, where a large premium is paid in early
years on account of the greater mortality of later
years, the policy-holder who allows his policy
to lapse loses the reserve which had accumulated
for him. What is the explanation of this huge
mortality in life insurance policies? It can be
only this: men are induced to take out life insurance
by misrepresentation, or by promises
which are not realized; and the extravagant
conduct of the business renders the cost of the
life insurance so great that the insured cannot
continue to carry it.

## THE WASTE IN SOLICITING

Consider how great this expense of solicitation
is. In the year 1904 the New York Life
spent in agents' commissions 11.62% of
all premiums received; the Equitable, 11.81%; the Mutual Life of New York, 13.57%; the Metropolitan, 15.01%;
and the Prudential, 18.98%. Note that
this is the average percentage paid for commissions
on all policies, old and new. The %age
on new business is of course much greater.
The Mutual Life paid in 1904 for commissions on
new business $6,691,016.56 out of premiums
aggregating $14,676,651.60, or 45.58%
of the year's premiums on new business. Yet
those figures present only a part of the expense
of solicitation. There is, in the next place, all
the advertising. For that the Mutual paid in
1904 the greater part of the amount charged to
"advertising, printing and postage," which
amounts to $1,134,833.76, or 7.73% of
the year's premium receipts from new business;
and besides this, there is all the office and inspection
expense directly entailed by this extensive
solicitation. The extent to which solicitation
is carried may be inferred from the fact,
that in the year 1904 the Equitable, the Mutual
Life and the New York Life actually wrote
102,314 policies carrying an aggregate insurance
of $244,862,421, which were not even
taken. That is, the applicant did not pay the
first premium. He was brought "to water,"
but could not be made "to drink." The aggregate
expense of solicitation in these three
companies must approximate sixteen %
of all premium receipts. When it is borne in
mind how small a part of the policies come to
the natural end of fruition to the policy-holder,
and how great consequently is the loss to the
policy-holder from lapsed and surrendered policies,
the extent of the economic waste resulting
from solicitation as practised will be realized.

## SAVING THAT IS LOSING

Life insurance is but a method of saving. The
savings banks manage the funds until such time
as they shall be demanded by the depositor ---
the insurance company ordinarily until the depositor's
death. The savings bank pays back to
the depositor his deposit with interest less the
necessary expense of management. The insurance
company in theory does the same. The
difference is merely that the savings bank undertakes
to repay to each individual depositor
the whole of his deposit with interest; while the
insurance company undertakes to pay to those
who do not reach the average age more than
they have deposited (including interest), and to
those who exceed the average age less than they
deposited (including interest).

How many wage-earners would insure in
these companies if they were told that for every
dollar they pay, forty cents will go to the stockholders',
officers' and agents' salaries, or for
other running expenses? How many wage-earners
would assume the burden of premiums if
they knew that there is but one chance in
twelve that they will carry their policies to
maturity?

How idle is the boast sometimes made by
these companies that they have returned to the
policy-holder the whole of his premiums. It is
as if the savings bank should boast of returning
to the depositor all of his deposit but without
any interest. Such practically is what the
Equitable, the New York Life and the Mutual
Life do to-day. The average expense of the three
companies, exclusive of taxes and fees, was 4.03% of their aggregate assets, while the
average of the return of the three companies on
investments was 4.20%. It means in
plain English that the company takes as compensation
for the care of the policy-holder's
money all that that money earns. Such were
the terms on which, during the troubled times
of the Napoleonic wars, the Duke of Hesse is
said to have intrusted his money to Meyer
Amschel Rothschild, and to have laid the foundation
for what, at least until recently, was the
world's greatest fortune.

## CAUSES OF ABUSES GENERAL

I have referred specifically to only five of the
ninety principal American legal reserve companies,
five which are closely allied with Wall
Street, which on January 1, 1905, held 56.89% of the aggregate assets, and which during
the year 1904 wrote 67.42% of all the
life insurance written by the ninety companies.
Of the remaining eighty-five, some are doubtless
managed far less efficiently and quite as
dishonestly as any of the leaders; many are,
no doubt, managed with scrupulous honesty,
and some with reasonable and comparatively
great economy; but the methods of conducting
the business, particularly of soliciting new business,
adopted by the leaders, is to a greater or
less extent, and perhaps necessarily, followed
by the others at the present time. The existing
evils are not to be explained by the presence in
office of dishonest or selfish men. The causes
which produce these rank abuses are general in
their operation. The flagrant dishonesty and
selfishness of the managers of the three leading
New York companies are the result, not the
cause, of the abuses. Men of character may
for a time protect other companies in large
part from like abuses, but the main cause of
the evils disclosed lies in the system, rather
than in the men.

It is obvious that the American people whose
attention has once been directed to these
abuses will not suffer them to continue without
some attempt at a remedy. What are the remedies
proposed?

## FEDERAL SUPERVISION NO REMEDY

The one most prominently mentioned is Federal
supervision. Under the decisions rendered
by the Supreme Court of the United States, an
act providing for Federal supervision would appear
to be clearly unconstitutional. But it is
apparently believed that the Supreme Court can
be induced to reverse itself. Senator Dryden
introduced on February 27, 1905, the bill
known as No. 7277, to which attention is
invited.

Note the provisions by which this bill seeks
to put an end to the intolerable abuses which
have been disclosed. An insurance company
authorized to do business in the State where
organized may, by filing a copy of its charter
and a financial statement and depositing $100,000 in securities with the treasurer of the United
States, secure a United States license, which
will entitle it to do business in any State unless
and until the license is revoked by the Federal
superintendent for failure to pay a judgment,
or because the company is deemed by him unsafe.
The bill omits very many of the provisions
which, for instance in Massachusetts, have
been inserted for the protection of the policyholder;
it adds not a single one by which he may
be better protected.

But even if the Federal law contained all the
provisions of the best of the State laws, will the
insured gain or lose by substituting the supervision
of one man at Washington for the supervision
of the several States? Assistant Attorney-General
Nash of Massachusetts, in his
able argument against Federal supervision,
has truly said:

>The wisdom, discretion and honesty composite
in fifty States and Territories are more
to be valued than the excellences of one person
appointed at Washington. State supervision is
good or bad, according to the merits of the best
of the commissioners. Federal supervision
must be good or bad, according to the qualities
of one man who is unchecked by the work of
co-ordinate officials.

The sole effect of a Federal law would be
--- the purpose of the Dryden bill may have
been --- to free the companies from the careful
scrutiny of the commissioners of some of the
States. It seeks to rob the State even of the
right to protect its own citizens from the legalized
robbery to which present insurance measures
subject the citizens, for by the terms of
the bill a Federal license would secure the right
to do business within the borders of the State, regardless
of the State prohibitions, free from the
State's protective regulations. With a frankness
which is unusual, and an effrontery which
is common --- among the insurance magnates
--- this bill is introduced in the Senate by
John F. Dryden, the president of the Prudential
Life Insurance Company, the company which
pays to stockholders annual dividends equivalent
to 219.78% for each dollar paid in
on the stock; the company which devotes itself
mainly to insuring the workingmen at an expense
of over 37.28 cents on every dollar of premiums
paid; the company which, in 1904, made
the worst record of lapsed and surrendered industrial
policies.

The Prudential Life Insurance Company has
a special reason for desiring to avoid State
supervision. Three years ago the Massachusetts
insurance commissioner insisted that the
policy-holders must be protected from the
scandalous financial relations between the Prudential
Company and its allied Fidelity Trust
Company --- from schemes as dangerous to the
interest of the insured as any laid bare by the
investigations of the Equitable, the New York
Life and the Mutual Life.

Federal supervision is also advocated by Mr.
James M. Beck (formerly Assistant AttorneyGeneral
of the United States), the counsel for
the Mutual Life Insurance Company, and his
main argument against State supervision appears
to be that the companies pay, in the aggregate,
for fees and taxes in the several States
$10,000,000, which he says is twice as much as
is necessary to cover the expense of proper supervision.
Ten million dollars is a large sum in
itself, but a very small one compared with the
aggregate assets or the aggregate expense of
management. Mr. Beck's company paid in
1904 $1,138,663 in taxes and fees. Its management
expenses were $15,517,520, or nearly
fourteen times as much. Our Massachusetts
savings banks paid in the year ending October
31, 1904, $1,627,794.46 in taxes to this Commonwealth;
that is, $80,890.02 more than their
whole expense of management, which was
$1,546,904.44.

Doubtless the insurance departments of some
States are subjects for just criticism. In many
of the States the department is inefficient, in
some doubtless corrupt. But is there anything
in our experience of Federal supervision of other
departments of business which should lead us to
assume that it will, in the long run, be freer from
grounds of criticism or on the whole more efficient
than the best insurance department of any
of the States? For it must be remembered that
an efficient supervision by the department of any
State will in effect protect all the policy-holders
of the company wherever they may reside.
Federal supervision would serve only to centralize
still further the power of our Government
and perhaps to increase still further the
power of the corporations. Supervision alone
--- whether State or Federal --- will not suffice
to correct existing abuses in the life insurance
business.

## FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES NECESSARY

In order to get rid of the abuses, the measures
to be applied must be radical and comprehensive.
The changes must be fundamental.
They are, in my opinion, these:

### Insurance a Method of Saving

_First_. The recognition of the true nature of
the life insurance business; namely, that its
sole province is to manage temporarily with
absolute safety and at a minimum cost the
savings of the people deposited to make appropriate
provision in case of death, and that
since its province is mainly to aid persons of
small means, it should be conducted as a beneficent,
not as a money-making, institution.

### Abolish the Blind Pool

_Second_. The issuance of deferred dividend
policies should be discontinued. The legitimate
business of a life insurance company is to insure
the life of the individual and to issue life annuities.
It should not be used as an investment
company or as a means of gambling on the
misfortunes of others. The deferred dividend
policy with its semi-tontine provision is open
to these objections and to others.

The premium in life insurance is ordinarily
computed on a higher death rate than actually
prevails, and a lower return upon investment
than is actually earned. The profits from these
and other sources, unless consumed by excessive
expenses or accumulated as surplus, are
commonly payable as dividends to the policyholder
either in cash or in reduction of future
premiums. Under the deferred semi-tontine
dividend policy the dividends are not paid over
annually to each policy-holder, but are accumulated
for long periods and the accumulated
funds distributed, so far as paid out at all,
among the surviving policy-holders of a particular
class.

The dividends thus accumulated form an
appreciable part of the huge funds controlled
by the companies. Thus of the $442,061,529.16
assets held on January 1, 1905, by the Mutual
Life, $71,539,311.70 consisted of what is
called "contingent guaranty fund" and what
is really deferred dividends. Of the $412,438,381
of the assets of the Equitable, it held
$63,800,000, which it included under the term
"surplus," but which was in fact deferred dividends.
The retention of these funds increases
unnecessarily the control of quick capital incident
to a large business. It promotes also
other evils. It tends to extravagance and inefficient
management, because it removes the
protection which flows from the annual accounting.
The annual dividend, the best practical
test of the efficiency of the management,
is thereby denied to the policy-holders.

The managers control as a "blind pool" this
huge fund not required as an insurance reserve.
They may with impunity and without discovery
make inroads upon it to cover up extravagance,
dishonesty, or the results of inefficient
management.

### Abolish Lavish Commissions

_Third_. Lavish payments for solicitors' and
agents' commissions and for advertising devices
should be discontinued. Such practices, common
among the promoters of mining enterprises
and of patents, have no place in the
business of life insurance. Savings banks have
no solicitors. The life-insuring habit is well
established. The three million people in Massachusetts
hold in the thirty-three legal reserve
companies doing business in the Commonwealth
1,337,795 life insurance policies, and have only
1,766,614 deposit accounts in our savings banks.
The people of the whole United States hold one
such policy for every four persons. Undoubtedly
many a man has been led by the solicitor's
persistence and eloquence to make a thrifty
provision for his family. No doubt, also, the
savings bank deposits would be swelled by
similar exhortation. But can such missionary
work be justified at an expense of twelve to
twenty % of all premiums paid, when the
record of lapsed policies shows that the conversion
to that thrift is but temporary? In the
year 1903 the Metropolitan wrote 1,788,828
industrial policies; in the year 1904 1,223,832
of its industrial policies lapsed. In the year
1903 the Prudential Company wrote 1,468,230
industrial policies; in the year 1904, 945,640
of its industrial policies lapsed. No one should
be induced to take out a policy when the burden
is greater than he can carry, or if for other
reasons it is not for his interest to do so. The
intelligent agent with the knowledge and a
recognition of the proper function of the life
insurance business, and receiving a modest
compensation, has still an economic justification.
Many men need the impetus to thrift,
since wisdom often lags far in the rear of intelligence;
but as the business is now conducted,
money paid by the insured as a result of solicitation
is in large part wasted. The existing
abuse is not that the solicitor earns too much,
but that his occupation as pursued is economically
unjustified.

### No Forfeiture of Policies

_Fourth_. The forfeiture of policies should be
prohibited. Under the level premium system
everyone pays each year more than is required
for the protection of the single year. He pays
something on account of future years. That
something ought in every case to be preserved
for the insured. The excuse offered by the
companies for lapsing is the great initial expense
of writing insurance, and that arises mainly
from the extravagant commissions paid to
agents and for lavish advertising. With the
suggested change of method in soliciting, no
extraordinary expense would be involved in
writing insurance except the fee for medical
examination, and that should be paid the
applicant as an initiation fee. The insured
should know when he enters upon the investment
what the initial cost is.

### Standard Forms of Policies

_Fifth_. Standard forms of policy should be
prescribed by law. This would go far toward
preventing deception. By simplifying and
standardizing the contracts, in connection with
compulsory annual dividends, the insured would
be enabled to compare results in the several
companies. To-day such a comparison is practically
impossible. The Equitable has outstanding
at least 224 different forms of policy;
the New York Life, 316; the Mutual Life, 220.
Standardizing policies would also much reduce
the work (and hence the expense) of the business.

### Restrict Investments

_Sixth_. The investment of the company's funds
should be surrounded by safeguards similar to
those adopted in the case of savings banks.
This would secure safety. This would also go
far in preventing the use of funds in speculative
enterprises, or to advance private interests, and
greatly limit the possibility of the companies engaging
in syndicate operations. Investments
should not be made in the securities of corporations
in which any executive officer or member
of the investment committee of the insurance
company is interested.

### Treasury Safeguards

_Seventh_. Further to protect the funds of the
companies and to prevent their being used
directly or indirectly to advance the private
or other interests of officers, provision should
be made to prohibit the executive officers from
engaging in any other business or holding office
in any other business corporations. Treasury
safeguards also should be adopted to prevent
payments without properly authorized
warrants.

### Accounting and Publicity

_Eighth_. Methods of accounting should be introduced
which would compel the entry of all
transactions in a single prescribed set of books,
and the submission to the directors at all meetings
of reports showing in detail the condition
and the operations of the company. In such
reports the cost of every department of the
business and every kind of business transacted
should be clearly determined and disclosed, and
likewise the condition, character and result of
each investment. Publicity as to the policyholders
also is essential to insure the proper conduct
of the business by officers and directors.

### Directors who Direct

_Ninth_. The board of directors must be composed
of men who recognize the proper function
of life insurance companies, and who, like
the trustees of our savings banks, recognize the
sacred trust involved in their control; men
who are willing to give to the companies the
time and attention required for the proper performance
of a director's duty; men who, having
the sole responsibility for the management
of the company, will not delegate to the
executive officers or committees powers which
the board alone should exercise.

Such comprehensive and fundamental changes
must be made if existing abuses are to be eradicated;
but even they will not prove effective
to protect the insured and the community unless
in addition:

### Limit the Size of Companies

_Tenth_. A limit must be placed upon the size
of the company. A company may, of course, be
too small to be a safe or an efficient and economical
unit; but it is clearly in the interest of
the insured that the company be not allowed to
expand beyond the point of greatest efficiency.
It is clearly in the interest of the whole people
that it be not allowed to expand beyond the
point of danger arising from concentration of
quick capital in the hands of a few individuals.
The constitutional right to so limit the size of
insurance companies is undisputed.

Throughout the early years of our history the
danger inherent in corporate control was so
well understood that in every State limits were
placed upon the amount of the authorized capital
of corporations of various kinds. The fear
of the power of large banking and industrial
combinations was then general. Under influences,
not always creditable, and under the
leadership of New Jersey, that limit upon the
amount of capital of corporations has been in
many States removed. Now corporations with
huge capital are allowed to exist almost everywhere
for almost any purpose. Having created
them we try ineffectually to check their operations
by anti-trust laws. We have tolerated
these monster manufacturing and mining companies
and the great railroad corporations mainly
because it is believed that somehow, through
consolidation, the public may be better served.
But whatever may be true in other fields of
business, it has been proved beyond doubt that
in life insurance mere increase in size does not
tend to lessen cost of management or to increase
returns from investment; that the largest companies
are unable to serve the public as well as
smaller institutions. It has also been shown
conclusively that many of the abuses in the life
insurance business, now disclosed, result directly
from the size of the companies. Man
has not kept pace in growth with his works.
Even the executives of the "Big Three" have
admitted their inability adequately to supervise
their companies. Perkins and other witnesses
have sought to excuse illegitimate syndicate
transactions and speculative underwritings
by the necessities of investing the huge sums
pouring into the large companies. On the other
hand, the investigation has also made clear that
these large insurance companies through the
power which inheres in the control of quick capital
expose the community to dangers which no
other kind of corporation presents to so great
an extent.

To eradicate abuses --- to protect the community
--- therefore, it is essential that the insuring
unit be kept relatively small. You must
limit the amount of premiums which it may
receive, and the assets which it may hold --- as
well as the scope and methods of the business.

These in general are the remedies which in
my opinion must be adopted to avoid the
abuses incident to the life insurance business
as now conducted.

## THE INEVITABLE ALTERNATIVE

What is the alternative? Not the discontinuance
or substantial reduction of life insurance;
for life insurance has become a prime
necessity. Not the continuance of the present
abuses; for the outraged and enlightened public
opinion will no longer tolerate them. If our
people cannot secure life insurance at a proper
cost and through private agencies which deal
fairly with them, or if they cannot procure it
through private agencies except at the price of
erecting financial monsters which dominate the
business world and corrupt our political institutions,
they will discard the private agency
and resort to State insurance.

Despite your or my protest, the extension of
government activity into fields now occupied
by private business is urged on every side.
Of all services which the community requires,
there is none in which the State could more
easily engage than that of insuring the lives
of its citizens. Stripped of the mysteries with
which it has been surrounded, and the misleading
devices by which it has been permeated,
the business of life insurance is one of extraordinary
simplicity. To conduct it successfully
requires neither genius nor initiative, and if
pursued by the State does not even call for the
exercise of any high degree of business judgment.
The sole requisites would be honesty,
accuracy, persistence and economy.

The business of life insurance, which the
companies now make so incomprehensible to
the insured, consists properly only of three
elements:

1. The initial medical examination.
2. The calculation of the so-called net premium or insurance and mortality reserve.
3. The investment of funds.

The first is the province of the physician; the
second a mere matter of arithmetic worked out
by the actuary and now actually performed in
large part also by our insurance departments
as a necessary incident of their supervision;
the third, the proper investment of funds,
would ordinarily require a high degree of judgment.
But if the business were conducted by
the State, the proper investment of funds would
not, at least in Massachusetts, present any difficulty.
The State and municipal loans would
take up all insurance reserve. The net indebtedness
of the Commonwealth on December 31,
1904, was $74,335,130.12, that of our cities and
towns $141,658,601. This aggregate of $215,993,731.11
presents a fund far greater than is
required as the legal reserve for all the policies
now outstanding in this Commonwealth. The
net value of all outstanding legal reserve life
insurance in Massachusetts on January 1, 1905,
was only $122,727,918. The aggregate premiums
paid in Massachusetts during the three
years ending January 1, 1905, to the thirtythree
old line companies was $79,033,991; but
the increase during those years of legal reserve
requirement was only $23,122,089. The increase
of the net State debt and of the gross
municipal debt during those years aggregated
$34,798,132.74. If the State had done this life
insurance business, the three years' increase of
legal reserve would not have sufficed to meet the
increased borrowings of the State and the municipalities.
In Massachusetts at least, a safe
investment for our insurance funds would thus
be assured.

The net return from such investment of the
funds by the State would compare not unfavorably
with that now received by the leading
insurance companies. It is true that the interest
return on Massachusetts State and municipal
bonds is less than the present average return
of the life insurance companies on investments;
but that return in case of State insurance would
be net. There would, as to the reserve funds, be
no expense of management. Furthermore, the
investment return of the insurance companies
is being almost steadily reduced, and the insurance
reserve on new business is being calculated
on the basis of three and a half or three %, which is as low as the average return on
State and municipal bonds.

## STATE INSURANCE UNDESIRABLE

In my opinion the extension of the functions
of the State to life insurance is at the present
time highly undesirable. Our Government does
not yet grapple successfully with the duties
which it has assumed, and should not extend
its operations at least until it does. But whatever
and however strong our conviction against
the extension of governmental functions may
be, we shall inevitably be swept farther toward
socialism unless we can curb the excesses of our
financial magnates. The talk of the agitator
alone does not advance socialism a step; but
the formation of great trusts --- the huge railroad
consolidations --- the insurance "racers"
with the attendant rapacity or the dishonesty
of their potent managers, and their frequent
corruption of councils and legislatures is hastening
us almost irresistibly into socialistic measures.
The great captains of industry and of
finance, who profess the greatest horror of the
extension of governmental functions, are the
chief makers of socialism. Socialistic thinkers
smile approvingly at the operations of Morgan,
Perkins and Rockefeller, and of the Hydes,
McCalls and McCurdys. They see approaching
the glad day when monopoly shall have
brought all industry and finance under a single
head, so that with the cutting of a single neck,
as Nero vainly wished for his Christian subjects,
destruction of the enemy may be accomplished.
Our great trust-building, trust-abusing capitalists
have in their selfish shortsightedness become
the makers of socialism, proclaiming by
their acts, like the nobles of France, "After
us, the Deluge!"
