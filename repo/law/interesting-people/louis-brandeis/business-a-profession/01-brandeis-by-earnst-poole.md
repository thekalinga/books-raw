_A REMARKABLE RECORD OF UNSELFISH WORK DONE
IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST_

\ 

During the Ballinger investigation, in which
he was the driving force, he frequently began
his day at four o'clock in the morning. His
pitiless examinations of witnesses and the startling
disclosures he made are widely known. But
the man himself is little known, for the man is
self-effacing.

He is fifty-seven years old, over medium height,
his rugged figure slightly stooped. His face,
with its high forehead, prominent cheek bones,
deep-set eyes and heavy lines about the broad
and sensitive mouth, gives an impression of
immense force, of a mind keen, subtle, trained,
a mind of large vision, big ideals. And yet it is
a likable face; his manner is kindly and he has
many devoted friends. His private practice is
one of the largest in New England, but more
than half his time is spent in public legal work.

And for this work he takes no fees. In an
address some years ago he said:

>It is true that at the present time the lawyer does
not hold that position with the people which he held
fifty years ago; but the reason is in my opinion not
lack of opportunity. It is because, instead of holding
a position of independence between the wealthy and
the people, prepared to curb the excesses of either, the
able lawyers have to a great extent allowed themselves
to become an adjunct of the great corporations,
and have neglected their obligation to use their powers
for the protection of the people. If we are to solve
the important economic, social and industrial questions
which have become political questions also, it
seems to me clear that the attitude of the lawyer in
this respect must be materially changed ... The
great opportunity of the American Bar is and will be
to stand again as it did in the past, ready to protect
also the interests of the people.

Of this work in the people's service, his story
is a unique example:

## THE ORIGIN OF BRANDEIS

He was born in 1856, in Louisville, Ky. He is
a Jew. For a century back his family was made
up of men of means, education, social ideals.
His maternal grandfather took an active part in
Poland's struggle of 1830. His father sympathized
deeply with the Bohemian movement of 1848.
And in Kentucky, before the war, his
father and his uncle were both intense abolitionists.
"My earliest memories," he told me,
"were of the war. One exceedingly painful
memory is of a licking I got in school on the
morning after Bull Run. I remember helping
my mother carry out food and coffee to the men
from the North. The streets seemed full of
them always. But there were times when the
rebels came so near that we could hear the firing.
At one such time my father moved us over the
river. Those were my first memories."

Later the family went abroad, and he was
placed in a Dresden school. His father suggested
that he remain in Europe and take up an
academic career. But the son refused. "I was
a terrible little individualist in those days," he
said, "and the German paternalism got on my
nerves. One night, for instance, coming home
late and finding I had forgotten my key, I
whistled up to awaken my roommate; and for
this I was reprimanded by the police. This
made me homesick. In Kentucky you could
whistle ... I wanted to go back to America,
and I wanted to study law. My uncle, the abolitionist,
was a lawyer; and to me nothing else
seemed really worth while."

When the panic of 1873 brought to his father
heavy losses in business, he still held to his
course. He entered the Harvard Law School,
working his way; he did his eyes an injury
from which they have never fully recovered;
and at the end of two years the authorities suspended
the rules to let him take his degree _at
twenty_. "Those years," he said, "were among
the happiest of my life. I worked! For me the
world's center was Cambridge." This enthusiasm
he retained, becoming the organizer, in
1886, of the Harvard Law School Association.

At twenty-two he began practice in Boston.
Before he was thirty his practice was large, and
since then it has steadily grown.
"I had my share of big corporation work," he told me.
"I even worked for a trust or two. Perhaps
that is one reason why I'm not a corporation
lawyer now."

He had many friends in the literary and musical
circles of Boston. But his deeper interest
was in social economic problems. "As a whole,"
he said, "I have not got as much from books as
I have from tackling concrete problems. I have
generally run up against a problem, have painfully
tried to think it out, with a measure of
success, and have then read a book and found
to my surprise that some other chap was before
me."

"I first went through the stage of charitable
work." He served on his district committee,
visiting in person the applicants for relief. In
the late eighties he acted as counsel in a movement
to reform certain state relief institutions,
and early in the nineties he took the lead in a
long and thorough investigation into the public
charitable institutions of Boston.

When he married in 1891, he had already
made up his mind to give more and more time
to public work, and with this purpose his wife
was in thorough accord. Though his income
was large, they agreed from the start upon a
most simple scale of living, so leaving time and
money free for the series of public struggles in
which he has engaged ever since.

In one of his early efforts there is a certain
grim humor. In 1897 he went to Washington
to appear _for the consumer_ in the Dingley Tariff
hearing. I quote from a paper of that date:
"Mr. Louis D. Brandeis, the brilliant young
Bostonian who appeared before the Ways and
Means Committee to-day on behalf of the consumers
of the United States, did not receive a
very cordial welcome ... 'I desire,' he said,
'to speak in behalf of those who form a far
larger part of the people of this country than
any who have found representation here.' ...
At this point there were signs of restlessness.
Chairman Dingley felt called upon to tell the
gentleman that this was not an appropriate
time for a speech on free trade. A Democratic
member said he supposed it would be in order
for one man to appear for the consumer. Mr.
Brandeis continued, and was again interrupted
by laughter and jeers. But Mr. Dalzell remarked,
'Oh, let him run down.'" And so this
lone representative of the consumer was allowed
five minutes more.

## HIS FIRST BIG FIGHT FOR THE PUBLIC

But his first important public struggle was
over the traction system in Boston. On the one
side were big financial interests, the political
machine and the press; on the other, a handful
of citizens creating public opinion. Brandeis
was their counsel, and admittedly the brains of
the fight.

For years he had felt that franchises were
public property which should not be given away.
He had seen the situation grow worse. In the
heart of the city the streets available for trolley
lines were few, narrow and crooked, and became
frightfully jammed. To relieve the congestion,
in 1896 the Tremont Street subway was built by
the city. This subway the West End Company,
controlling most of the surface lines, undertook
to lease, and it was over this lease that the first
struggle came. A small group of citizens forced
a hearing. Brandeis appeared as their counsel.
The fight was carried on into the Legislature,
and finally the lease was granted --- not for fifty
years, but for twenty years, with a rental to the
city of 4.875% of the cost of construction.
A victory for the people.

"When I asked Mr. Brandeis for his bill,"
the man at the head of this movement told me,
"I expected to pay a fee of five thousand dollars
"I expected to pay a fee of five thousand dollars
at least. There is no fee,' he said. 'This is
part of a plan of mine.' And he added that as
soon as he could do so he intended giving the
larger part of his time freely to public work."

The work came soon. In 1897 certain New
York financiers acquired the Boston Elevated
Railway Company. Having bought an old and
impracticable elevated charter, they secured
amendments granting them almost perpetual
rights. They also secured authority to lease
the West End Company's surface lines, and
they asked for a lease of ninety-nine years. Had
this been granted, they would have been in
complete control of the transportation system.
But with a group of vigilant citizens, Brandeis
renewed the contest. The lease was reduced
to twenty-five years, and in other ways the new
company's powers were cut down. The company,
moreover, had one vulnerable point.
The Tremont Street subway, the only connecting
link between the two parts of the elevated
system, was still under strong municipal control.

Accordingly, when to meet the increasing
traffic another subway was asked for in 1900, the
company tried to secure the right to build it and
own it practically in perpetuity, and also to
secure an extension on their Tremont Street
subway lease for another twenty years. Over
this key to the situation came the main struggle.
And here again on the side of the people Brandeis
took the lead. When the Public Franchise
League was formed, he became its counsel. He
was active in winning over the Associated
Board of Trade, and in its name a bill which he
drafted was introduced providing for the construction
of the new subway by the city, with
a lease on the same terms as the old one. In
support of this bill he appeared at all hearings.
He went in person repeatedly to the editors of
the hostile press. "It was here," he told me,
"that we had our first lessons in making public
opinion." Slowly the public sentiment grew.
And finally, after a bitter three years' contest,
an act almost identical with his original bill was
passed, providing for the construction of one
or more subways by the city, to be leased for a
term not exceeding twenty-five years, at a rental
of 4Â½% of the cost.

In 1911 the contest over the subway leases
broke out anew. With a "strap-hanging" public
clamoring for new subways, the Elevated
Company announced that it could assume no
further burdens without assured possession of
both the new and the old subways and tunnels
for about fifty years. The Railroad and Transit
Commissions indorsed this position, and many
timid citizens, eager for relief from congestion,
were ready to yield. The Public Franchise
League, however, with Brandeis once more leading
the fight, opposed this attempt to fasten the
company's grip upon the city, and argued that
the best guarantee such a company can have is
the good will of the public induced by its own
good behavior. This view was speedily championed
by the press, and an act, drawn under
the guidance of Mr. Brandeis, with the approval
of Governor Foss, was finally passed by
the Legislature and accepted by the company,
which provided for the new subways and for
leases subject to termination by either the
city or the company at the end of twenty-five
years.

"Boston has thus established," he writes,
"the policy of retaining control of its transportation
system. The city will own all the subways,
and through this ownership and the right
to revoke surface locations, will control the entire
traction system, with power to compel corporations
to pay what may seem from time to
time adequate compensation for the use of the
streets."

## A STRUGGLE FOR CHEAPER GAS

The next struggle, to secure cheaper gas for
Boston, was won in its crisis, not by fighting the
company, but by working with it. And for this
change of policy Brandeis was responsible.

For twenty years the city's gas companies
had been involved in endless scandals. The
service was poor and the price was high, one
dollar a thousand feet. But all Massachusetts
gas companies are subject to strict state control;
and, when in 1903 the Boston companies
applied for leave to consolidate, the Public
Franchise League saw its opportunity. A
long and strenuous contest took place over the
issue of capital, the Franchise League contending
that, if the company were allowed the high
capitalization it asked for, lower prices of gas
in future would be made impossible. When
things had come to a crisis, Brandeis proposed
his plan of co-operation. It startled many in
the League; some even withdrew, accusing him
of being in secret alliance with the trust. But
he held to his course, and after earnest discussion
the plan was finally carried out. Its main
provisions were these:

The company's capital was fixed practically
at the limit set by the League at the start.
Ninety cents per thousand feet was made the
"standard price" of gas. And a "standard
dividend" was fixed at 7%. This
meant a return of less than 4Â½% on the
physical value of the property and on its cost
to the present owners. _But the act further provided
that for every five-cent reduction in the price
of gas, the dividend might be increased one per
cent_.

This gave a strong incentive to concentrate
all the energy, formerly used in financial and
political intrigue, on the making of gas at the
lowest possible cost. As a result, the price has
been reduced to eighty cents. From 1905 to
1913, $6,247,923.35 in the aggregate has been
saved to the consumers, and yet dividends have
been increased some 2%.

"It has been proved," he says, "that a public-service
corporation may be managed with
political honesty and yet successfully. To reduce
the price of gas we need not only honesty
but also skill, energy and initiative. And this
may be best secured by following those lines of
intelligent self-interest upon which the remarkable
industrial advance of America has proceeded.
Those who manage our public-service
corporations should be permitted, subject to
proper safeguards, to conduct the enterprise
under the conditions which in ordinary business
have proved a sufficient incentive to attract
men of large ability and to insure from them
their utmost efforts for its advancement."

## THE NEW HAVEN RAILROAD

Brandeis has led one other fight in New England
against a big corporation.

Before 1906 the New York, New Haven &
Hartford Railroad had been steadily gaining
control of transportation in New England.
Among other things it had acquired about
five hundred miles of trolley lines in Massachusetts
contrary to the law of the state. And
in 1906 the governor warned the legislature
of the New Haven's encroaching power, urging
legislation to prevent it. The New Haven company
contended that having a Connecticut
charter it was not subject to Massachusetts laws.
It invited the state's attorney general to test
the validity of this claim, and agreed pending a
decision to make no further acquisitions in the
state. On this understanding the legislature
adjourned without taking action and the attorney
general began proceedings. While these
were pending, however, the New Haven company,
regardless of its promise, acquired more
than one-third of the stock of the Boston &
Maine Railroad. The legislature then passed
an act restraining the New Haven, until July,
1908, from acquiring additional stock in the
Boston & Maine or from voting on that already
acquired.

Meanwhile public feeling rose high. The
Anti-Merger League was formed, with Brandeis
for its counsel. The support of thousands of
Massachusetts merchants and of commercial
and civic organizations and labor unions was
secured. Their campaign was pushed with
energy, Brandeis engaging in a long series of
public debates with the New Haven's vice-president.
The railroad, too, had strong support.
People were sick of the Boston & Maine's
poor service; they believed its management un-progressive
and its financial condition weak,
and that if the New Haven could gain control it
would bring up the service. The danger of monopoly
they proposed to remove by legislative
control.

Brandeis, however, contended that the Boston
& Maine was recovering from its financial weakness
and could soon provide needed improvements,
but that the New Haven had by its
recent excessive expansion become perilously
weak, and that the burdens thus assumed must
not only prevent its making large improvements,
but would create a heavy charge upon all future
traffic. Moreover, he cited the scores of railroads,
trolley and steamship lines which it had
already acquired, and claimed that if the Boston
& Maine be added to these, the result must
be a monopoly of all transportation by land or
water within New England and also between
New England and the rest of the country. To
control a monopoly so enormous, he declared,
would be impossible. One small group of New
York financiers would govern absolutely New
England's future growth.

Meanwhile the New Haven had presented a
bill legalizing the purchase of its Boston & Maine
stock. This bill was defeated. In the same year
the state Supreme Court, in the case brought by
the attorney general, decided that the New
Haven was subject to Massachusetts laws and
that in acquiring Boston & Maine stock it had
violated the statute. Shortly after this, with
the approval of President Roosevelt, Attorney
General Bonaparte began suit against the New
Haven under the Sherman act. The opponents
of the merger therefore ceased their work, believing
that their fight was won.

But in 1909 in Washington a new administration
came into power; and in Massachusetts
a new governor was elected, who was favorable
to the New Haven. Late in the session this
governor sent in a special message paving the
way for a bill which empowered the New Haven
to acquire through a holding company all the
stock of the Boston & Maine. Tremendous
pressure was brought to bear, and the bill was
passed. "The passage of this bill," said French,
the federal district attorney, "does not change
matters in the slightest degree regarding the
federal government's merger suits against the
New Haven road." But four days later, on the
same day that French was pressing the court
to set down the case for argument, Attorney
General Wickersham ordered the suit dropped.

With all legal obstacles thus removed, the
holding company was formed, and by this means
the control of New England's transportation
was delivered to the New Haven.

Brandeis predicted an increase in rates if the
merger were allowed. Taking the two roads'
own estimates, their passenger rates were soon
increased by about $1,500,000 a year, and they
applied for increases in freight rates which exceeded
$2,000,000 more. "The need for more
revenue was caused," Brandeis maintained,
"not so much by increase in operating expenses
as by the financial burdens assumed in their
sudden excessive expansion, purchasing properties
at high values, borrowing money at high
rates."

In no controversy in which he has engaged
has his judgment been so emphatically and
dramatically vindicated as here. Month by
month the operation of what he calls the "inexorable
law of arithmetic" made itself felt ---
until railroad service in New England, especially
upon the Boston & Maine, became intolerable.
Frightful accidents took place. And
complaints multiplied to such an extent that
the Interstate Commerce Commission finally
ordered a thorough investigation of the whole
situation. The results of this investigation and
Commissioner Prouty's report are now well
known. The criticisms of the New Haven's
financial policy made by Brandeis six years before
were more than sustained; and at the present
time the Department of Justice in Washington
and the Governor of Massachusetts are
trying to undo the work of their predecessors in
office, break the New England transportation
monopoly and restore sane and healthy conditions.

## A BRILLIANT SUCCESS

Meanwhile Mr. Brandeis had undertaken a
project which has since met with brilliant
success.

In 1905, in the investigation into the Equitable
Life Assurance Society, as unpaid counsel
for the protective committee of policy holders,
he drafted recommendations urging radical
changes to reduce the enormous waste of the
system and provide safeguards against abuse.
It is said that Grover Cleveland, one of the
newly appointed trustees, gave these recommendations
to Paul Morton, the incoming
president of the Equitable, and told him that
on these principles the reorganization should
proceed. They are, in the main, the same principles
later insisted upon by Charles E. Hughes
and embodied in the Armstrong bill.

This work led Brandeis to a close study of the
insurance business. The total amount of insurance
in the ninety leading companies he
found to be nearly thirteen billions of dollars,
more in amount than the value of all the railroads
in the country at that time, their total
income exceeding the revenues of the federal
government. Nearly half the total assets were
in the hands of three Wall Street companies;
and this vast accumulation of quick capital gave
them an ever-tightening grip on the business of
the country. "The economic menace of past
ages," he said in an address at that time, "was
the _dead hand_, which gradually acquired a large
part of all available lands. The greatest economic
menace of to-day is a very _live_ hand,
these great insurance companies which control
so large a part of our quick capital."

On the one hand a prodigious concentration
of money power; on the other, an intimate concern
of every man. In the ninety companies
there were outstanding over 21,000,000 policies
affecting directly or indirectly about 30,000,000
men, women and children. And through the
waste and abuses inherent in the system the cost
of insurance was terribly high. This was doubly
true of "industrial insurance," purchased mainly
by the poor, the policies being for small amounts
and the premiums collected weekly from house
to house. Mainly through this extravagant
method, about two-fifths of the policy-holders'
money went into running expenses.

Brandeis undertook to work out some plan
by which the wage-earners of the country might
get cheaper insurance, and by which in the
course of time the business might be taken out
of the hands of a few and placed in social institutions
all over the land. In Massachusetts
such institutions already existed. There were
in that state 189 savings banks, managed by
about three thousand men who regarded them
as quasi-public trusts and so gave their services.
The cost of management was less than one-tenth
of that in insurance companies. Why not add
insurance departments to these banks? He drew
up a tentative plan, for months he lectured and
wrote on the subject, the Savings Bank Insurance
League was formed, and a bill which he drafted
was introduced, empowering savings banks of
the state to establish insurance departments.

This bill was bitterly opposed by the old industrial
companies. But the League was hard
at work. Volunteer speakers stumped the
entire state; for six months Brandeis spoke
from two to six nights every week; a petition
of 150,000 names was presented, and tens of
thousands of letters poured in on the legislature.
In 1907 the bill passed. And by the
end of 1908, in two banks the system was
established.

From their earnings, after paying all charges
and setting aside all possible reserves, they declared
at the end of the first year an 8.33% dividend to the policy holders --- a sum equal
to one month's premium. And besides, the
policy holders got a rate twenty-two %
less than that given by the old industrial
companies.

Since then two more banks have adopted the
system, and their reports in January, 1914,
showed more than eight thousand policies in
force, representing more than $3,000,000 of insurance.
A fifth-year dividend has been declared
on the monthly premium policies, equalling
20% of a year's premiums.

This reduction has resulted from radical
changes. In place of the old wasteful method
of house-to-house solicitation, the League began
a campaign of insurance education. Volunteer
speakers, together with paid insurance
instructors, spoke in factory towns, and the
manufacturers gave cordial support. Through
their aid meetings were held, literature was
distributed, and finally the instructor went
through the factory talking in person to each
employee. In this way the business has been
secured with little expense. And the old method
of house-to-house collection has been also
done away with. Premiums are paid either
through the employer or at the bank.

Two hundred employers of labor throughout
the state are now co-operating with the banks
and with the state by becoming unpaid agencies
for the receipt of applications and the transmission
of premiums of their employees.

Far more significant than the success of these
banks has been the effect on the old industrial
companies. There is space here for but one of
the concessions made. For more than twenty
years they had made no reduction in premiums;
but since the new movement started their premiums
have been reduced on an average of
about 20%. This means a saving to
Massachusetts wage-earners of over $1,000,000
a year, and to the people of the country it will
probably mean within a few years an annual
saving of from fifteen to twenty millions.

"Our work so far," said Brandeis, "has affected
only industrial insurance, but I believe
that workingmen's insurance in America is
soon to assume gigantic proportions and become
the bulk of all insurance. Shall these
wage-earners be served by an exploiting business,
with dangerous power in a few hands, or
by public and quasi-public institutions all over
the country?"

## SHORTER HOURS FOR WOMEN WORKERS

In other big struggles affecting wage-earners,
Brandeis has taken a leading part. One was
in behalf of our millions of women factory
workers.

In 1907, in Oregon, a law restricting women's
work in factories and laundries to ten hours in
one day was contested and carried to the United
States Supreme Court. And through the National
Consumers' League, Brandeis undertook
its defence.

The law had been attacked as against the
constitutional right of freedom of contract.
This freedom, however, is subject to the police
powers of the states. If it could be proved that
the legislature in passing the law had reasonable
grounds for believing that a day longer than
ten hours is so injurious to women as to be a
danger to the community, the court must hold
the law constitutional.

Brandeis saw that the crux of the case lay in
the human facts involved. He accordingly
outlined a brief and called upon the Consumers'
League to collect and arrange the facts. Miss
Josephine Goldmark of the League undertook
the work. All available evidence was collected.
With this he went before the court, and the
result was a unanimous decision upholding the
law.

But he saw that the fight was not over, and
he determined to strengthen the evidence.
Under his guidance Miss Goldmark again set
to work, with a large corps of assistants, to
prepare an exhaustive brief on the subject. It
was ready none too soon. In 1909, in Illinois,
a similar law was contested before the Supreme
Court of the state, and again Brandeis led the
defence. The manufacturer's claim, that a certain
woman thirty-five years in his employ
could not earn a living wage unless she worked
over ten hours a day, acted as a boomerang.
And the result was again a victory.

In 1911 Brandeis was invited by the attorney
general of Ohio to assist in the defence of a
somewhat similar Ohio statute regulating hours
for women. He submitted a brief in this case
before the Supreme Court of the state, which
held the law constitutional. The case was
carried on appeal to the Supreme Court of the
United States. Brandeis again filed a brief and
took part in the oral argument. And the Supreme
Court, in 1914, upheld the law. In 1912
he was again active in the defence of the Illinois
law, which was again the subject of attack, its
scope having been widely extended.

In November, 1913, Âª request for assistance
came from a new source. This was in regard to
the minimum wage rulings of the Oregon Industrial
Welfare Commission. The commission was
established by statute in 1913 and empowered
to establish such wages, hours of labor and
conditions of work as appeared, after investigation,
to be necessary for preservation of the
health and welfare of the employees. The
minimum wages for women employed in factories
and stores were promulgated by the commission
in September, 1913. Constitutionality
of the act under which these orders were issued
was contested in the courts, and at the commission's
request Brandeis again, with Miss
Goldmark's aid, filed a brief showing the relation
of wages to health, morals and efficiency.
In March, 1914, a unanimous decision was
handed down sustaining the law.

In his work in these labor cases there are
two points of especial significance.

First, the method of argument marks a revolutionary
change. Hitherto such cases had been
argued _deductively_, from the legal precedents,
upon abstract theories of what is right and what
is wrong. But the method used here is _inductive_.
The first Illinois brief contains only four
pages of strictly legal argument; the remaining
605 pages go straight to the medical, social and
economic facts involved. And the spirit of
modern science thus successfully brought into
court will doubtless have a far-reaching effect on
future court decisions.

Second, the brief is significant for what it
proves _beyond_ its point. For the knowledge of
the whole civilized world on the subject of
overwork is assembled here. It is shown that
in this tense machine age an hour's work means
far more than it did a century back; that excessive
work not only weakens the body and
opens the way to diseases, but itself produces
an actual poison, "the toxin of fatigue"; that
fatigue weakens self-control and leads to the
use of drink and drugs; that overwork tends
to exhaust the central nervous system upon
which the vital functions depend; and finally
that through overwork the danger of accidents
is increased, the greatest number of accidents
coming between eleven and twelve in the morning
and between four and six in the afternoon,
when the senses are dulled by fatigue.

Overwork is especially fatal to women. By a
terrific array of evidence it is shown that working
women are sick far more often than men,
that their mortality is higher, and that in
thousands of cases the child-bearing function is
impaired. Sterility, miscarriage, stillbirth ---
each is common; and children born to exhausted
women are at birth below normal weight and
size. Through the mother's weakness and her
absence from her baby, the infant death rate
is terribly high, while thousands grow up weaklings.
And the danger is not to health alone.
or a mother returning exhausted at night, with
the cooking and washing still to be done, has
little will or energy left; and the moral hold of
the home is lost. The very preservation of a
people, therefore, is threatened by such overwork.
In districts where it has long existed
actual race degeneration has set in.

The evidence shows, on the other hand, that
shorter hours have resulted in vastly improving
the whole tone of the community; that they
have worked no injury to the employer, for by
the increased efficiency as much work was done
as before, generally more; and that, instead of
lowering wages, with the resulting increase of
output wages also have increased.

In the face of such evidence it becomes plain
that a ten-hour law hardly touches this intricate
problem. Hours of labor both for women and
men will undoubtedly be still further shortened.
And as a sound scientific basis for future legislation,
this brief has been still further expanded.

"In every public job that Brandeis has
tackled," said one of his friends, "you will find
this same long-headed view. Out of the thick
of each fight he is in, he seems to look into the
future."

## A GREAT TASK ACHIEVED

This is true of his work in settling strikes.

The cloakmakers' strike in New York, in the
summer of 1910, involved some seventy thousand
employees and a business of $180,000,000 a year.
Conditions were bad. The hours were long and
irregular, and through a system of subcontracting
the pay for most workers was wretchedly
low. The strike was bitter, sudden, chaotic;
men starved on $1.50 a week, and refused to
hear of compromise. The dispute had centred
around the "closed shop." The union
would listen to no terms without it; employers
were equally set against it; two attempts at
conference had split upon this rock.

Then Brandeis was called in. It was midsummer,
his time for vacation; but he came at
once to New York, as usual giving his services.
He soon won the confidence of both sides.

"He was a man," said the union's socialist
lawyer, "to whom we did not hesitate to talk
openly from the start. He showed a broad mind
and a fine sense of fairness. It was the most
wonderful handling of a strike situation that
I've ever seen."

This is shown by the minutes of the conference.
For the class struggle was here deep,
fundamental, made bitter by the chaos of the
past. Repeatedly the two sides clashed. But
repeatedly, with sound reasoning and demand
for the facts, the arbitrator came between.
Knowing the closed-shop issue to be the danger-point,
he persistently put it off, in order that
first both sides might see that on all other points
they could agree. When it came up at last he
offered a compromise plan (his invention) "the
preferential union shop." This was refused,
and the strike went on. But a month later an
agreement was reached. Wages were raised,
hours reduced, the system of subcontracting
abolished, and many other improvements made.
But by far the most important result was the
adoption, in a more definite form, of the Brandeis
plan for a preferential union shop. The
final agreement describes it as follows:

>A shop where union standards as to working
conditions, hours of labor and rates of wages
prevail, and where, when hiring help, union
men are preferred; it being recognized that
since there are differences in degree of skill
among those employed in the trade, employers
shall have freedom of selection as between one
union man and another, and shall not be confined
to any list nor bound to follow any prescribed
order whatever ... The Manufacturers'
Association, however, declare their belief
in the union, and that all who desire its benefits
should share in its burdens.

To make it effective, provisions were added
for a price committee, a shop chairman, a committee
on grievances, a board of sanitary control
and a board of arbitration. On this board,
Brandeis was chosen as the third man.

During the three years since then, the development
of the industry has completely justified
his anticipations. There has been no general
strike. The rate of wages, increased in 1910,
has been maintained, and concerns which for
some time paid below the union scale have been
compelled to conform to it. In August, 1913,
a demand having been made for higher wages
and the matter referred to the Board of Arbitration,
the board caused an intensive study
of the whole subject to be made, the report of
which will soon appear. The industry has been
more and more stabilized. The forty-eight-hour
week has been more strictly adhered to, overtime
has been paid double and there has been
an enormous improvement in the sanitary conditions
of the shop, a continual raising of the
standards of health. The machinery of the
Protocol, or working agreement, has been
enormously facilitated and improved. A body
of industrial laws and precedents has grown up
based on justice to both sides. Of eight thousand
cases arising in two years, only nine had to be
referred finally to the Board of Arbitration, the
others having been settled by the parties themselves.
Of course there has been agitation and
misunderstanding; but, where such excitement
formerly would have led to disastrous strikes, it
now passes harmlessly over the industry. The
Board of Arbitration has become a supreme
industrial court to which great problems of
fundamental policy alone have been referred.
A better spirit has prevailed between the two
parties, a spirit of conciliation. The leaders on
both sides have been educated to the standpoint
which Brandeis had originally taken, that
of considering the industry as a whole. It is
still an experiment, imperfect and full of the
difficulties inherent in industrial relations. It
demands the greatest possible self-control on
both sides. But it contains the germ of a great
idea; an element of industrial statesmanship.

"Prolonged peace and prosperity," Brandeis
maintains, "can rest only on the foundation of
industrial liberty. Industrial democracy should
ultimately attend political democracy. Industrial
absolutism is not merely impossible in this
country at the present time, but is most undesirable.
Our employers can no more afford
to be absolute masters of their employees than
they can afford to submit to the mastery of
their employees. Bluff and bluster have no
place here. The spirit must be 'Come, let us
reason together.' Such conferences are necessarily
time-consuming, but the time cannot be
better spent. There are no short cuts to evolution."

## THE LAWYER IN THE BALLINGER CASE

Until his appearance before the Interstate
Commerce Commission as counsel for shippers
in the Freight Rate Advance Case, the
most widely known of all his work in the
people's service was done in the Ballinger
investigation.

About two weeks before the investigation
began, he became counsel for Glavis. Those two
weeks he spent delving into the mass of details
involved. It was an amazing instance of swift
absorption. The committee, it was feared,
would make short work of Glavis; but if this
were intended, it was made impossible by the
brilliant history of the whole matter which
Brandeis gave at the start.

His task was hard; for the whole administration
was set against the investigation. To the
requests for records there were delays, and later
even denials. But over what records he could
secure, he used to work in his room late at night,
and he was often at work again at four o'clock
in the morning. Out of these dry records he
tried to build up the part each man had played,
to visualize the story. And out of this patient
searching came two disclosures which startled
the country.

For their understanding a few dates are
needed. On August 18, 1909, Glavis submitted
his charges. On September 6, Ballinger submitted
a mass of documents in reply. On September
13 the President exonerated Ballinger
and dismissed Glavis. Two months later Glavis
appealed to the country. On December 21, the
Senate requested the President to transmit to
Congress _any reports, statements, papers or documents
upon which he had relied in reaching his
conclusion_. And the President complied.
Among the papers submitted were a summary
and a report by Attorney General Wickersham,
dated September 11.

In the course of time Brandeis began to suspect
that these Wickersham papers had not
been written on September 11. If so, why had
not the President referred to them in his letter
of September 13? Moreover, they were dated
only five days after Ballinger had submitted
his mass of evidence. How could the Attorney
General have made in five days so careful an
analysis of the huge mass of confused and intricate
papers submitted, _so unfair_ an analysis,
adroitly keeping back some facts and giving undue
weight to others? Finally he found definite
proof. The report referred to a certain statute
as mentioned by Glavis in his letter. Glavis
had _not_ mentioned it in his letter to the President.
But he _had_ mentioned it in his Collier's
article _over two months later_.

Still Brandeis hesitated. The officials involved
were so high. If he failed to completely
prove his point, the recoil would be terrific.
But when Finney, a subordinate to Wickersham,
was on the stand, Brandeis asked him such
questions as these: "What do you know of that
report? _When did you first see it? When did
you first hear of it_?" And though Finney's
answers were evasive, from the startled expression
on his face and on certain other faces,
Brandeis finally made up his mind. He put
the question that afternoon. "Had not the Attorney
General antedated his report?"

"The silence in that room," said one, "was
instant, terribly intense. For everyone knew
that before risking such a question, Brandeis
must have proof of his facts." Finney evaded
the question. Two days later Brandeis called
for a statement from Wickersham. The committee
refused to make the request. But a resolution
making a like request was introduced
into Congress, and in a communication to the
Committee of the House the Attorney General
admitted that his report was not written until
long after the day of its date, long after the
President's decision. A similar admission was
made later by the President.

At the time of this admission Ballinger was
on the stand. Brandeis had long been insisting
that this chief witness be called. He knew
the risk he ran of turning the public against him
if he pressed his man too hard; but he took the
risk. "I have never heard," said one lawyer,
"so relentless an examination. When any other
man would have stopped out of sheer pity, still
he kept on." But the bursts of rage from the
witness, his misstatements and self-contradictions,
had a fatally damaging effect. Repeatedly
he made denials, which a series of keen,
quiet questions broke down. These questions
showed a disturbingly accurate knowledge of
Ballinger's every move from August 26 to September
13, his itinerary in minutest detail,
down to the trains he took, exact hours of arrival,
who met him at stations, where they went.
At one point Senator Root intervened. "Mr.
Brandeis," he asked indignantly, "were you
having this man followed by a detective?"
Brandeis smiled and answered, "No."

"As a matter of fact," as he later told the
committee, "this wonderful detective work was
quite simply done. I knew Ballinger's main
itinerary. I then secured back copies of the
local newspapers in the places he visited; and
in them, quite naturally, I acquired my marvellous
knowledge."

When Wickersham had made his admission,
Brandeis began pressing Ballinger upon another
matter. He knew that Ballinger's subordinate,
Lawler, had drafted a letter on which the President
had largely based his letter of exoneration.
This Lawler letter had never been mentioned.
Brandeis knew of it from Kerby, Lawler's stenographer,
who had refused to come out with
a statement. He now questioned Ballinger on
the same subject. And it was when the latter
showed by his answers his resolve to keep back
the truth that Kerby decided to state what he
knew. Further, he said he had found the notebook
in which he had taken Lawler's dictation,
and had had photographs made of the pages
containing the letter. Here at last was definite
proof.

Close on the Ballinger denial, the Kerby
statement appeared in a Western paper. The
telegraphic report, which reached the White
House at noon, failed to include the fact that
Kerby had proof. The White House issued a
denial. Later in the day the full report, including
the proof, appeared in a Washington
paper. The next day the President sent to the
Investigating Committee a long statement admitting
the truth of what Kerby had said. The
President stated among other things that he
had asked Mr. Lawler "to prepare an opinion
as if he were President."

From these two exposures it was plain that
the President, in response to the Senate's request,
had sent to Congress an important paper
on which he had _not_ relied in reaching his conclusions,
because it was not in existence; and
also that he had _omitted_ to send another important
paper on which he _did_ rely, from which he
_copied portions_. These disclosures did much to
convince the public. For if the administration
must so shield a man, how unfit must he be to
continue in office!

Of the work of Brandeis here, the most interesting
part to me is his handling of the reporters.
From the start, knowing how little he had to
hope for from the majority of the committee,
he presented his case direct to the American
people. Night after night in his room he worked
with the newspaper men, explaining the day's
significant points. And the result of this work
was great. For Mr. Ballinger's resignation was
mainly due to the strong public sentiment made
through the press.

In his closing argument, Brandeis stated
what he believed to be the real significance of
the work. "This investigation," he said, "has
been referred to as a struggle for conservation,
a struggle against the special interests. It is
that: but it is far more. In its essence, it is the
struggle for democracy, the struggle of the small
man against the overpowering influence of the
big; politically as well as financially, the struggle
to establish the right of every American to equal
justice in the public service as well as in the
courts, that no official is so highly stationed that
he may trample ruthlessly and unjustly upon
even the humblest American citizen. The cause
of Glavis is the cause of the common people,
and more especially the cause of the hundreds
of thousands of government officials."

## BRANDEIS AND THE RAILROADS

Not long after this, Brandeis entered a contest
of greater magnitude than any in which he
had ever before engaged. He became counsel
for all the trade organizations of the Atlantic
seaboard in the hearing on the proposed advance
in railroad rates before the Interstate
Commerce Commission.

"I opposed these rates," he told me, "both
because the method of raising them, by horizontal,
arbitrary and undiscriminating increase,
was a departure from all previous practice in
rate making, disregarding the effect of the increase
upon the business affected; and also on
the ground that many of the railroads, if they
needed additional income at all, needed it because
of a reckless policy of aggrandizement and
other financial excesses."

"But the point that struck me most was this:
While the railroads were seeking to increase
rates in order to overcome the increase of operating
cost, largely due to increased wages which
would amount to a small %, there were
immense possibilities of introducing economies
of many times the amount. For the railroads,
during the last ten years, through the practical
elimination of competition and through their
increase beyond the unit of greatest efficiency,
had come to be even less economically operated
than before. The main economies of operation
they had made were those resulting from the
levelling of grades, elimination of curves, introduction
of larger cars and engines --- in short,
improvement in plant. They had left practically
unworked the field of attaining _greater
efficiency through the new science of management_
--- a science which in other industries was already
being developed with wonderful results,
a science by which the efficiency of the individual
workman was often more than doubled, resulting
in both largely increased compensation
to the worker and increased profit to the
employer.

"I therefore urged that if the roads needed
greater income they should resort to increase
of managerial efficiency, and that it would but
put a premium on uneconomical management
to permit an increase of rates simply because
there appeared to be need of greater income.
This policy was particularly dangerous because
of the open declaration of the railroad presidents
that the increases sought were but the
beginnings of demands for still higher rates, and
that the community must accustom itself to
the idea that rates generally would continue to
increase."

The outcome of this controversy is well
known. The commission refused to allow the
increase in both the eastern and the western
divisions of the railroads of the country. Mr.
Brandeis's activity not only had the effect of
concentrating public attention upon the case
and the real issues involved, but also of creating
widespread and unusal interest in the question
of scientific management. As one of the
engineers said: "By a single stroke Brandeis
created a greater advance in scientific management
than would otherwise have come in the
next quarter of a century."

"The great fact to remember is this," he told
me. "The coming _science of management_, in
this century, marks an advance comparable
only to that made by the coming of the _machine_
in the last. The profits from the machine were
absorbed by capital. But we have developed
a social sense. And now of the profits that are
to come from the new scientific management,
the people are to have their share. These profits
are to be immense. On our railroads alone
at least a million dollars a day might be saved
by this kind of management. Not all the material
resources in our land can compare to this
prodigious field, the possibilities of the science
which will increase the efficiency of man. And
_this_ public domain must not be preÃ«mpted."

What the commission thought of Mr. Brandeis's
work in this case is indicated by the fact
that in the summer of 1913 they engaged him as
counsel for the commission itself in the matter
of the renewed application of the railroads for
a similar general increase in rates, the case which
is now going on in Washington.

## BRANDEIS AND THE "MONEY TRUST"

His most recent work, at the time of this
writing, has been his attack on the "money
trust," a work which has had a large share in
bringing forward important bills which deal
with the trusts of the country.

"On nothing has he ever worked harder,"
writes Mr. Norman Hapgood, "than on his
diagnosis of the money trust, and when his life
comes to be written (I hope many years hence)
this will be ranked with his railroad work for its
effect in accelerating industrial changes. It is
indeed more than a coincidence that so many
of the things he has been contending for have
come to pass. It is seldom that one man puts
one idea, not to say many ideas, effectively before
the world, but it is no exaggeration to say
that Mr. Brandeis is responsible for the now
widespread recognition of the inherent weakness
of great size. He was the first person who
set forth effectively the doctrine that there is
a limit to the size of greatest efficiency, and the
successful demonstration of that truth is a profound
contribution to the subject of trusts.
The demonstration is powerfully put in his
testimony before the Senate Committee in 1911.
In destroying the delusion that efficiency was
a common incident of size, he emphasized the
possibility of efficiency through intensive development
of the individual, thus connecting
this principle with his whole study of efficiency,
and pointing the way to industrial democracy."

Such, in brief, is the public work of this man
in a little over twenty years. For such work he
has urged the importance of big successful
lawyers keeping themselves free. He has kept
himself free: striving to hold a position of absolute
independence "between the wealthy and
the people." On the one hand, he has no close
political ties: he has declined every proffer of
office, has occasionally even refused to work for
or against any candidate. On the other, he has
no connection with any big corporation. "I
would rather have clients," he told me, "than
be somebody's lawyer." He has steadily tried
to rid himself of all property influence; he has
no investments in the Boston public utilities,
and made it a rule not to take a financial interest
in a business for which he was counsel. His
income is large, but he spends little. He is a
generous giver. "I have only one life, and it's
short enough," he said. "Why waste it on
things that I don't want most? And I don't
want money or property most. I want to be
free."

In his home, the standard set about twenty
years back has remained the same. He lives in
a simple house and he has few material wants ---
keeping himself free from the encumbrance of
things. In his house you at once feel at home.
He has many warm friends and a wide acquaintance;
he is a keen appreciator of men. "It's
hard to interview Brandeis," said a well-known
writer. "He wastes your time interviewing
_you_."

Each year more of his time is given freely to
public work. Each year certain big special
interests grow more bitter against him, for he
is a patient, pitiless antagonist, and the reforms
he proposes go deep.

>We are sure to have for the next generation
an ever-increasing contest between those who
have and those who have not. There are vital
economic, social and industrial problems to be
solved. And for these we need our ablest men.
The reason why we have not made more progress
in social matters is that these problems have
not been tackled by the practical men of high
ability, like those who have worked on industrial
inventions and enterprises. We need _social inventions_,
each of many able men adding his
work until the invention is perfected.
>
>I have no rigid social philosophy. I have
been too intense on concrete problems of practical
justice. And yet I can see that the tendency
is steadily toward governmental control. The
government must keep order _not only physically
but socially_. In old times the law was meant to
protect each citizen from oppression by physical
force. But we have passed to a subtler civilization;
from oppression by force we have come
to oppression in other ways. And the law must
still protect a man from the things that rob him
of his freedom, whether the oppressing force
be physical or of a subtler kind.
>
>There is no such thing as freedom for a man
who under normal conditions is not financially
free. We must therefore find means to create
in the individual financial independence against
sickness, accidents, unemployment, old age and
the dread of leaving his family destitute, if he
suffer premature death. For we have become
practically a world of employees; and, if a man
is to have real freedom of contract in dealing with
his employer, he must be financially independent
of these ordinary contingencies. Unless we protect
him from this oppression, it is foolish to call
him free. Moreover, since most men are employees
and since men must work to live, the
law should see that they are protected from oppression
in their work, from excessive hours of
labor and other conditions injurious not only
to them alone but through them to the common
good.
>
>This principle applies in general to the whole
question of property rights. Property must be
subject to that control of property which is
essential to the enjoyment by every man of a
free individual life. And when property is used
to interfere with that fundamental freedom of
life for which property is _only a means_, then
property must be controlled. This applies to the
regulation of trusts and railroads, public utilities
and all the big industries that control the
necessities of life. Laws regulating them, far
from being infringements on liberty, are in
reality protections against infringements on
liberty.
>
>Property is only a means. It has been a
frequent error of our courts that they have made
the means an end. Once correct that error, put
property back into its right place, and the whole
social-legal conception becomes at once consistent.
I see no need to amend our Constitution.
It has not lost its capacity for expansion to meet
new conditions, unless it be interpreted by rigid
minds which have no such capacity. Instead
of amending the Constitution, I would amend
men's economic and social ideals. I believe that
our judges are as honest as you can make men.
But like all the rest of us they are subject to
their environment. And law has always been a
narrowing, conservatizing profession. In England
it was always easy for a Tory government
to find great lawyers for judicial office, but for
a Liberal government it was hard. And so it
has been throughout history. Nearly all of
England's great lawyers were Tories.
>
>What we must do in America is not to attack
our judges, but to educate them. All judges
should be made to feel, as many judges already
do, that the things needed to protect liberty are
radically different from what they were fifty
years back. In some courts the judges' conceptions
of their own powers must also change.
Some judges have decided a law unconstitutional
simply because they considered the law
unwise. These judges should be made to feel
that they have no such right, that their business
is not to decide whether the view taken by
the legislature is a wise view, but whether a
body of men could reasonably hold such a view.
In the past the courts have reached their conclusions
largely deductively from preconceived
notions and precedents. The method I have
tried to employ in arguing cases before them has
been inductive, reasoning from the facts.
>
>In general, I believe that the courts and the
people have been too far apart. There is no
subject so complex that the people cannot be
interested in it and made to see the truth about
it if pains enough be taken; and I believe that a
common agreement of public sentiment should
influence the court's decision on many a question.
>
>For the aspirations of the people must have
adequate legal expression. Otherwise we shall
have a revolt. The whole industrial world is in
a state of ferment. It is in the main peaceful,
and to a considerable extent silent; but there
is felt to-day very widely the inconsistency in
this condition of political democracy and industrial
absolutism. The people are beginning
to doubt whether in the long run democracy and
absolutism can coexist in the same community;
beginning to doubt whether there is really a
justification for the great inequalities in the
distribution of wealth. This movement must
necessarily progress; the people's thought will
take shape in action. And it lies with our lawyers
to say in what lines that action shall be expressed:
wisely and temperately or wildly and
intemperately; in lines of evolution or in lines
of revolution.
>
>Young men who feel drawn to the legal profession
may rest assured that they will find in it
an opportunity for usefulness which is probably
unequalled elsewhere. There is and there will be
a call upon the legal profession to do a great
work for this country.

He is fond of quoting these lines from Euripides,
written over two thousand years back,
but which have a pregnant meaning for us now:

>Thou hast heard men scorn thy city, call her wild
>
>Of counsel, mad; thou hast seen the fire of morn
>
>Flash from her eyes in answer to their scorn!
>
>Come toil on toil, 't is this that makes her grand,
>
>Peril on peril! And common states that stand
>
>In caution, twilight cities, dimly wise ---
>
>Ye know them, for no light is in their eyes!
>
>_Go forth, my son, and help!_
