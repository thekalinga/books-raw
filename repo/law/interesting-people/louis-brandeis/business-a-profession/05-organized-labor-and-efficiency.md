# ORGANIZED LABOR AND EFFICIENCY[^5/1]


[^5/1]: An Address before The Boston Central Labor Union on April 2, 1911. Published in _The Survey_, April 22, 1911.

The assertion that American prosperity is
due to our great natural resources is only partly
true. The fertile fields of the West would
have brought us little wealth, but for mechanical
science, and the development of agricultural
machinery which eliminates waste in
human labor.

In New England, particularly, our necessities
and not our resources were the real cause
of our prosperity. A poor soil drove us to
manufacturing. High wages necessitated the
saving of human labor and became the mother
of our inventions, giving us labor-saving machinery.
That the people of the East have
not attained even greater general well-being
is due, in large part, to the fact that the supply
of foreign low-priced workingmen made
it possible to meet the demand for higher
wages by means other than the elimination
of labor waste. Human nature, like the inanimate,
seeks the path of least resistance. To
think hard and persistently is painful. The
path of the pioneer is beset with obstacles.
It was easier to tap the inexhaustible foreign
labor supply than to devise and to introduce
better methods and better management. Instead
of keeping down the labor cost by eliminating
unnecessary human effort and increasing
the productivity of the individual, we met
the workingman's demand for higher wages
by increasing the supply of workers. Instead
of conserving the workingmen, we accepted the
substitutes for those who had been incapacitated
by disease or accident resulting from excessive
toil or improper conditions of employment.

Fortunately a new necessity has intervened:
the awakened social sense of the community,
with its longing for a truer democracy. This
great ethical movement for real brotherhood
of man reinforces the demand of the workingman
for wages, hours and conditions which
will permit of his living according to those higher
standards essential to life, health and the
performance of the duties of citizenship in a
democracy. These new and increasing demands
have created a new necessity for economy
in production. And scientific management
comes prepared to relieve that necessity by
a revolution in industry comparable only to
that effected in the transition from hand
labor to machinery.

It is important that the scope and incidents
of scientific management be not misunderstood.

So much has been said of increasing the
efficiency of labor that the importance of increasing
the efficiency of materials, of plant,
of working capital, and of improving service
has not been fully appreciated. And yet
the economies and the profits arising from the
scientific handling of those factors in business
are probably, in the aggregate at least, as great
as from the increased efficiency of labor itself.

Saving the waste in materials is attained
in part through securing that article which is
determined by scientific tests to be best adapted
to the needs; and incidentally proper tests tend
to eliminate dishonesty in purchasing. Saving
of waste in material is attained in part by so
utilizing it that a lower cost results, even if the
article was purchased at a higher price. It is
attained in part through proper methods of
storage and accounting, which prevent actual
waste of the material itself and dishonesty in
its use.

Saving in plant is attained not only by
adopting the best, but by so equalizing, placing
and using the equipment through careful
planning as to secure practically its full use
all the time; thus reducing the capital invested
upon which charges for depreciation,
interest or rental, taxes and insurance, must be
earned.

Saving in working capital is attained by
so controlling and linking the quantity of
supplies necessarily carried, and so eliminating
delays in the process of manufacture,
as to reduce materially the amount invested
in raw material and supplies and in work in
process.

Improving the service so as to secure certainty
and prompt deliveries reduces expense
and annoyances, and vastly increases the successes
and profits of the sales department.

Scientific management seeks to do for industry
systematically and comprehensively in
conserving effort, materials and capital, what
heretofore has been done sporadically and partially.
Its engineers refuse to recognize that
there is any legitimate sphere in industry for
ignorance or lack of skill. Ignorance and unskilfulness
necessarily spell waste, --- and waste
is sinful, whether it be due to lack of training,
of selection, of equipment or of planning.

In discussing the efficiency of labor a construction
altogether too narrow has been given
by some to the term "labor." The labor to be
made more effective is that of the managers
and high-salaried officials quite as much as
that of the wage-earners. Indeed, the increased
efficiency of the wage-earner is not
possible until the heavy demands which scientific
management makes upon those controlling
and directing the business, including
superintendents and foremen, are fully met.
Increased efficiency must begin with those
her up. This is of the essence of scientific
management.

Some persons unfamiliar with the principles
and application of scientific management
have assumed that there is in it something
hostile to labor, and particularly to organized
labor. This is absolutely unfounded.

_First!_ They have assumed that the aim of
scientific management is "speeding up"; that
it seeks to make the men work harder, thus
exhausting the workingmen. Such criticism
shows complete misconception of scientific
management. Conserving human effort, and
the man, is a fundamental tenet of scientific
management. Among other things, it demands
careful training of the workingman: and
the employer's investment involved in that
training creates a special incentive to the employer
to retain his employee and to conserve
his powers.

When Fred W. Taylor, with infinite patience
and genius, discovered the laws by
which a given quantity of pig iron might be
loaded into a car or a given quantity of coal
be shovelled by hand in a third or fourth of
the time ordinarily taken, he was protecting his
workmen, not exhausting them.

The larger production incident to scientific
management is not attained by "speeding up."
It comes largely from removing the obstacles
which annoy and exhaust the workman --- obstacles
for which he is not, or should not be
made, responsible. The management sees to it
that the best possible way of doing the job is
shown the worker; that is, the way which takes
least time, which takes least effort, and which
produces the best result. The management
sees to it that the worker's machine is always
in perfect order. The management sees to it
that he is always supplied with the necessary
materials. The management sees to it that
the work comes to him at proper times, with
proper instructions and in proper condition.
Relieved of every unnecessary effort, of every
unnecessary interruption and annoyance, the
worker is enabled without greater strain to
furnish much more in production. And under
the exhilaration of achievement he develops his
capacity.

_Second_: Closely associated with the erroneous
idea that scientific management means
"speeding up" is the objection to scientific
management because of the bonus system.
That objection assumes that scientific management
_is_ the bonus system. The protest
of labor against the bonus system is in part
well founded; because the bonus is apt to do
more harm than good when applied otherwise
than as a part of the system of scientific
management. The bonus system is a common
incident under scientific management; but it
must not be supposed that it _is_ scientific management.
There has been a great deal of scientific
management without the application of
the bonus system at all. But it is an integral
part of scientific management that the workingman
should get a "square deal," that he
should get a proper share of the profit which
he aids in producing, that his achievement
should secure an appropriate reward. And in
practice it has been found that this can be done
usually more fairly through the bonus system
than by any other available method of compensation.
But by the bonus system must be
understood something very different from the
bonus system which has been applied in many
establishments to produce "speeding up." It
involves these essential conditions:

1. A scientific investigation in detail of each
   piece of work, and the determination of the
   best method and the shortest time in which
   the work can be done.
2. A teacher capable of teaching the best
   method and the shortest time.
3. Reward for both teacher and pupil when
   the latter is successful.

Has anybody ever heard of the bonus system
operating unfavorably to labor where
these conditions have existed?

Higher wages, to be provided by the bonus
system or otherwise, constitute but one of the
ways in which scientific management will advance
the condition of the laborer. The workingman
needs, besides higher wages, among
other things, shorter hours of work. What
greater hope can there be for shorter hours
than that afforded by scientific management,
the purpose of which is to eliminate, in every
way, waste of human labor? If the productivity
of the individual man is increased, perhaps
even doubled or trebled, there will come
with it the possibility of largely reducing the
hours of work.

We are agitating now for the eight-hour
day already introduced in many industries and
in the public service. We are far from attaining
the ideal; but we should not forget
that it is due to science in business, to the
labor-saving machines which have already so
largely increased the productivity of man, that
we have been able to make some progress
toward our ideal working day. A hundred
or even fifty years ago the working day was
from twelve to fifteen hours long in many
industries in which it is now but eight or
nine.

With higher wages and shorter hours, the
greatest need of the working man is regularity
of employment. Irregularity of employment
creates hardships and demoralization of
every kind. It is the most sinful waste.

The introduction of scientific management
in business has, wherever applied, made regularity
of employment its prime aim. It could
not be otherwise; because irregularity is the
most potent cause of waste, not only of labor,
but of plant and of capital. The existence of
irregularity of employment is one of the greatest
reproaches to modern business. It proves
that the management has not done its part;
and the very essence of scientific management
is to relieve the workingman from these conditions
and hardships which arise from the
failure of the management to do its duty.

_Third_: Again, some persons have expressed
their apprehension of scientific management, as
if it were inconsistent with, or at least hostile
to, unionism. This rests upon an entire misconception.

The essence of unionism is collective bargaining;
that is, instead of the employer dealing
individually with each employee, he deals
with a large body through their representatives,
in respect to the rate of wages and the
hours and conditions of employment. Is there
not just as broad a sphere for collective bargaining
in shops where scientific management
has been introduced as where it has not? Collective
bargaining may fix the minimum wage,
be it by the day or by the piece; collective
bargaining may fix the bonus, if any: where
it shall begin; its rate of increase; and how
it shall be applied; may fix the hours of labor
and all the other conditions of employment
just as much as if the management were of
the old rule-of-thumb, chaotic type. Surely
it is not inconsistent with the principles of
collective bargaining that one worker may
earn more than another; for in most successful
unions, like the cigarmakers and the boot
and shoe workers, most of the operatives are
on piece work, and the earnings of some workers
are double or treble those of others doing
like work in the same shop.

_Fourth_: Again, some persons have objected to
scientific management on the ground that it
would throw workmen out of employment. This
has not been the result, and will rarely be.

Scientific management undertakes to secure
greater production for the same or less effort;
but that does not mean that less people will
have work to do. If only the same amount
were to be produced, the same number of persons
might well be employed to do it, if they
worked less hours or less hard. But a more
satisfactory answer is found in the fact that
the amount of products which can be consumed
will depend practically upon the ability
to buy.

If goods can be purchased cheaper, more
can be bought for the same money. And
more will be bought; at least if wages remain
the same or increase. The problem is exactly
the same which was presented when the cost
of transportation was reduced by substituting
railroads for the stage coach, and the cost of
goods was lowered by substituting machinery
for hand labor. Has anyone ever known the
demand for labor to decrease when profits
were large? The demand for labor grows because
the demands of the people grow with
the ability to supply them.

_Fifth_: It has been suggested by some that
scientific management will displace the inefficient.
On the contrary, it helps the "inefficient"
most.

Scientific management recognizes the right
of those less expert in the work to advance
to greater efficiency, and the importance to
the employer of training his workmen to be
competent. It therefore provides through the
most practical teachers for careful training of
men to work in the best manner and to develop
habits of industry, instead of letting the
"devil take the hindmost" and exposing the
less competent to the probability of discharge.
It supplies instruction, and offers to the teachers
special incentives if they succeed in bringing
up the hindmost.

The social gains to the workingman through
scientific management are greater even than
the financial. He secures the development and
rise in self-respect, the satisfaction with his
work, which in almost every line of human
activity accompany great accomplishment by
the individual. Eagerness and interest take
the place of indifference, both because the
workman is called upon to do the highest
work of which he is capable, and also because
in doing this better work he secures appropriate
and substantial recognition and reward.
Under scientific management men are led, not
driven. Instead of working unwillingly for
their employer, they work in co-operation with
the management for themselves and their employer
in what is a "square deal."

As stated above, scientific management offers
the means of meeting our social demands.
The great advance created by the introduction
of machinery we permitted, in large
measure, to be dissipated socially --- instead of
utilizing the opportunity fully to raise the
standard of our civilization. Another great
opportunity is offered us. Shall we seize it?
And I think that means primarily, will organized
labor seize it?

If the fruits of scientific management are
directed into the proper channels, the workingman
will get not only a fair share, but
a very large share of the additional profits
arising from improved industry. In order
that the workingman may get this large share
of the benefits through higher wages, shorter
hours and better working conditions, the labor
unions must participate in fixing those wages,
hours and conditions, and in determining the
application to the various businesses of the
principles of scientific management. Unless
the workingman is so represented, there must
be danger that his interest will not be properly
cared for; and he cannot be properly represented
except through organized labor. This,
then, is the supreme opportunity for organized
labor.

Will you utilize it to the full?
