# Business --- A Profession[^2/1]

[^2/1]: An address delivered at Brown University Commencement Day, 1912. Originally published in _System_, October 1912.

Each commencement season we are told by the college reports the number
of graduates who have selected the professions as their occupations and
the number of those who will enter business. The time has come for
abandoning such a classification. Business should be, and to some extent
already is, one of the professions. The once meagre list of the learned
professions is being constantly enlarged. Engineering in its many
branches already takes rank beside law, medicine and theology. Forestry
and scientific agriculture are securing places of honor. The new
professions of manufacturing, of merchandising, of transportation and of
finance must soon gain recognition. The establishment of business
schools in our universities is a manifestation of the modern conception
of
business.

The peculiar characteristics of a profession as distinguished from
other occupations, I take to be
these:

*First*. A profession is an occupation for which the necessary
preliminary training is intellectual in character, involving knowledge
and to some extent learning, as distinguished from mere
skill.

*Second.* It is an occupation which is
pursued largely for others and not merely for one\'s
self.

*Third.* It is an occupation in which the
amount of financial return is not the accepted measure of
success.

Is not each of these characteristics found today in business
worthily
pursued?

The field of knowledge requisite to the more successful conduct
of business has been greatly widened by the application to industry not
only of chemical, mechanical and electrical science, but also the new
science of management; by the increasing difficulties involved in
adjusting the relations of labor to capital; by the necessary
intertwining of social with industrial problems; by the ever extending
scope of state and federal regulation of business. Indeed, mere size and
territorial expansion have compelled the business man to enter upon new
and broader fields of knowledge in order to match his achievements with
his
opportunities.

This new development is tending to make business an applied
science. Through this development the relative value in business of the
trading instinct and of mere shrewdness have, as compared with other
faculties, largely diminished. The conception of trade itself has
changed. The old idea of a good bargain was a transaction in which one
man got the better of another. The new idea of a good contract is a
transaction which is good for both parties to
it.

Under these new conditions, success in business must mean
something very different from mere money-making. In business the able
man ordinarily earns a larger income than one less able. So does the
able man in the recognized professions --- in law, medicine or
engineering; and even in those professions more remote from
money-making, like the ministry, teaching or social work. The world\'s
demand for efficiency is so great and the supply so small, that the
price of efficiency is high in every field of human
activity.

The recognized professions, however, definitely reject the
size of the financial return as the measure of success. They select as
their test, excellence of performance in the broadest sense --- and
include, among other things, advance in the particular occupation and
service to the community. These are the basis of all worthy reputations
in the recognized professions. In them a large income is the ordinary
incident of success; but he who exaggerates the value of the incident is
apt to fail of real
success.

To the business of to-day a similar test must be applied.
True, in business the earning of profit is something more than in
incident of success. It is an essential condition of success; because
the continued absence of profit itself spells failure. But while loss
spells failure, large profits do not connote success. Success must be
sought in business also in excellence of performance; and in business,
excellence of performance manifests itself, among other things, in the
advancing of methods and processes; in the improvement of products; in
more perfect organization, eliminating friction as well as waste; in
bettering the condition of the workingmen, developing their faculties
and promoting their happiness; and in the establishment of right
relations with customers and with the
community.

In the field of modern business, so rich in opportunity for
the exercise of man's finest and most varied mental faculties and moral
qualities, mere money-making cannot be regarded as the legitimate end.
Neither can mere growth in bulk or power be admitted as a worthy
ambition. Nor can a man nobly mindful of his serious responsibilities to
society, view business as a game; since with the conduct of business
human happiness or misery is inextricably
interwoven.

Real success in business is to be found in achievements
comparable rather with those of the artist or the scientist, of the
inventor or the statesman. And the joys sought in the profession of
business must be like their joys and not the mere vulgar satisfaction
which is experienced in the acquisition of money, in the exercise of
power or in the frivolous pleasure of mere
winning.

It was such real success, comparable with the
scientist\'s, the inventor\'s, the statesman\'s, which marked the career
of William H. McElwain of Boston, who died in 1908 at the age of
forty-one. He had been in business on his own account but thirteen
years. Starting without means, he left a fortune, all of which had been
earned in the competitive business of shoe manufacturing, without the
aid of either patent or trademark. That shows McElwain did not lack the
money-making faculty. His company\'s sales grew from \$75,957 in 1895 to
\$8,691,274 in 1908. He became thus one of the largest shoe
manufacturers in the world. That shows he did not lack either ambition
or organizing ability. The working capital required for this rapidly
growing business was obtained by him without surrendering to outside
investors or to bankers any share in the profits of business: all the
stock in his company being owned either by himself or his active
associates. That shows he did not lack financial
skill.

But this money-making faculty, organizing ability and
financial skill were with him servants, not masters. He worked for
nobler ends than mere accumulation or lust of power. In those thirteen
years McElwain made so many advances in the methods and practices of the
long-established and prosperous branch of industry in which he was
engaged, that he may be said to have revolutionized shoe manufacturing.
He found it a trade; he left it an applied
science.

This is the kind of thing he did: In 1902 the
irregularity in the employment of the shoe worker was brought to his
attention. He became greatly impressed with its economic waste, with the
misery to the workers and the demoralization which attended it.
Irregularity of employment is the worst and most extended of industrial
evils. Even in fairly prosperous times the workingmen of America are
subjected to enforced idleness and loss of earnings, on the average,
probably 10--20% of their working time. The irregularity
of employment was no greater in the McElwain factories than in other
shoe factories. The condition was not so bad in shoe manufacturing as in
many other branches of industry. But it was bad enough; for shoe
manufacturing was a seasonal industry. Most manufacturers closed their
factories twice a year. Some manufacturers had two additional slack
periods.

This irregularity had been accepted by the trade --- by
manufacturers and workingmen alike --- as inevitable. It had been bowed to
as if it were a law of nature --- a cross to be borne with resignation.
But with McElwain an evil recognized was a condition to be remedied; and
he set his great mind to solving the problem of irregularity of
employment in his own factories; just as Wilbur Wright applied his mind
to the aeroplane, as Bell, his mind to the telephone, and as Edison, his
mind to the problems of electric light. Within a few years irregularity
of employment had ceased in the McElwain factories; and before his death
every one of his many thousand employees could find work three hundred
and five days in the
year.

Closely allied with the establishment of regularity of
employment was the advance made by McElwain in introducing punctual
delivery of goods manufactured by his company. Shoes are manufactured
mainly upon orders; and the orders are taken on samples submitted. The
samples are made nearly a year before the goods are sold to the
consumer. Samples for the shoes which will be bought in the spring and
summer of 1913 were made in the early summer of 1912. The solicitation
of orders on these samples began in the late summer. The manufacture of
the shoes commences in November; and the order is filled before
July.

Dates of delivery are fixed, of course, when orders
are taken; but the dates fixed had not been taken very seriously by the
manufacturers; and the trade was greatly annoyed by irregularities in
delivery. McElwain recognized the business waste and inconvenience
attendant upon such unfulfilled promises. He insisted that an agreement
to deliver on a certain day was as binding as an agreement to pay a note
on a certain
day.

He knew that to make punctual delivery possible,
careful study and changes in the methods of manufacture and of
distribution were necessary. He made the study; he introduced the
radical changes found necessary; and he so perfected his organization
that customers could rely absolutely upon delivery on the day fixed.
Scientific management practically eliminated the recurring obstacles of
the unexpected. To attain this result business invention of a high order
was of course necessary --- invention directed to the departments both of
production and of
distribution.

The career of the Filenes of Boston affords another
example of success in professionalized business. In 1891 the Filenes
occupied two tiny retail stores in Boston. The floor space of each was
only twenty feet square. One was a glove stand, the other a women\'s
specialty store. Twenty years later their sales were nearly \$5,000,000
a year. In September, 1912, they moved into a new building with more
than nine acres of floor space. But the significant thing about their
success is not their growth in size or in profits. The trade offers many
other examples of similar growth. The pre-eminence of the Filenes lies
in the advance which has been made in the nature, the aims and the
ideals of retailing, due to their courage, initiative, persistence and
fine spirit. They have applied minds of a high order and a fine ethical
sense to the prosaic and seemingly uninteresting business of selling
women\'s garments. Instead of remaining petty tradesmen, they have
become, in every sense of the word, great
merchants.

The Filenes recognized that the function of retail
distribution should be undertaken as a social service, equal in dignity
and responsibility to the function of production; and that it should be
studied with equal intensity in order that the service may be performed
with high efficiency, with great economy and with nothing more than a
fair profit to the retailer. They recognized that to serve their own
customers properly, the relations of the retailer to the producer must
be fairly and scientifically adjusted; and, among other things, that it
was the concern of the retailer to know whether the goods which he sold
were manufactured under conditions which were fair to the workers --- fair
as to wages, hours of work and sanitary
conditions.

But the Filenes recognized particularly their
obligations to their own employees. They found as the common and
accepted conditions in large retail stores, that the employees had no
voice as to the conditions or rules under which they were to work; that
the employees had no appeal from policies prescribed by the management;
and that in the main they were paid the lowest rate of wages possible
under competitive
conditions.

In order to insure a more just arrangement for
those working in their establishment, the Filenes provided three
devices:

*First*. A system of self-government for
employees, administered by the store co-operative association. Working
through this association, the employees have the right to appeal from
and to veto policies laid down by the management. They may adjust the
conditions under which employees are to work, and, in effect, prescribe
conditions for
themselves.

*Second.* A system
of arbitration, through the operation of which individual employees can
call for an adjustment of differences that may exist between themselves
and the management as to the permanence of employment, wages, promotion
or conditions of
work.

*Third.* A minimum
wage scale, which provides that no woman or girl shall work in their
store at a wage less than eight dollars a week, no matter what her age
may be or what grade of position she may
fill.

The Filenes have thus accepted and applied
the principles of industrial democracy and of social justice. But they
have done more --- they have demonstrated that the introduction of
industrial democracy and of social justice is at least consistent with
marked financial success. They assert that the greater efficiency of
their employees shows industrial democracy and social justice to be
money-makers. The so-called \"practical business man,\" the narrow
money-maker without either vision or ideals, who hurled against the
Filenes, as against McElwain, the silly charge of being \"theorists,\"
has been answered even on his own low plane of material
success.

McElwain and the Filenes are of course
exceptional men; but there are in America to-day many with like
perception and like spirit. The paths broken by such pioneers will
become the peopled highways. Their exceptional methods will become
accepted methods. Then the term \"Big business\" will lose its sinister
meaning, and will take on a new significance. \"Big business\" will then
mean business big not in bulk or power, but great in service and grand
in manner. \"Big business\" will mean professionalized business, as
distinguished from the occupation of petty trafficking or mere
money-making. And as the profession of business develops, the great
industrial and social problems expressed in the present social unrest
will one by one find
solution.
