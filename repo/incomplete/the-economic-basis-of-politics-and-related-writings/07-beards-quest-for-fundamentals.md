## Beard's Quest for Fundamentals in the Amherst College Lecture Series

Compiler's note: In the preceding chapter, Beard called
brief attention to certain special efforts that had been made
to interpret history in terms of the economic interests of
the human race. It was his frank opinion that this field
had not been explored as fully and vigorously as circumstances
warranted. In an article published years ago he
said: "... a cursory examination of economic journals in
the Library of Congress discloses no considerable interest
in the theory and practice of historical composition. ...
This indifference is doubtless reciprocated by most historians.
It would be interesting to know how many American
students of history have read the great classics in economics
from Adam Smith through Marx to Marshall and
John Bates Clark. Not many, it may be guessed. Some
historians have given a little thought to economic matters.
In dealing with Hamilton, Webster, Calhoun, and Andrew
Jackson, they can scarcely escape seeing banks, tariffs,
currency, and slavery. Yet historians seldom deal with
these topics in the coherent manner that characterizes
economic thought. Either they do not have the requisite
training, or, having training, they find it impossible to
bring the stubborn facts of the historical uproar into any
consistent and meaningful whole."

Beard attributed this, in large measure, "to the growth
of specialization." In reality, he held: "Political facts, economic
facts, ethical facts are not isolated particularities;
they are phases or aspects of events and personalities. .
An economic fact ... may be at the same time a political
or ethical or military fact."[^/37]

Undaunted, himself, by the formal boundaries erected
by the specialists, Beard ultimately undertook a comprehensive
study of the economic forces affecting the political
history of the Western world to see if he could, by tackling
what he had once termed "the stubborn facts of the historical
uproar," bring them into some "consistent and
meaningful whole." In 1916, he embodied the results of
this inquiry in four lectures delivered at Amherst College,
under the auspices of the Clark Foundation. With some
revision, this material was published by Alfred A. Knopf in
1922 as The Economic Basis of Politics. In 1945, hesitating
to obscure his early work, Beard added some footnotes
in brackets and included a new fifth chapter, to
bring the account abreast of more recent developments.
Finally, the compiler of the present volume has integrated
the new material of the last chapter of the 1945 edition
with the old material in the last chapter of the 1922 edition
to smooth the flow for easier use today --- in a manner
carefully described by footnotes for the convenience of
anyone wishing to distinguish between passages written in
different years. Thus overhauled, The Economic Basis of
Politics is reprinted here as Chapters III through VII.

As should logically be expected of the author of the
presentation in Part I on the shortcomings of historians
and of the conventional methods of organizing historical
data, Beard qualifies his basic economic analyses of political
history in the pages that follow, an operation deserving
the close scrutiny of the critical reader.
