## The Adoption of the Constitution[^/1481]

The new constitution was ratified by conventions of
delegates chosen at the polls; but it should be remembered
that, under the property qualifications then imposed upon
the suffrage, a large portion of the adult males were
debarred from participating in the elections. Generally
speaking, the propertyless, who were disgruntled with the
handiwork of the Philadelphia conference, could do
nothing but gnash their teeth.

Among those who led in the ratification of the new
Constitution everywhere were men of substantial property
interests who had suffered most from the enterprises of the
state legislatures. The supporters of the new instrument
in the states included in their ranks the leaders in every
economic activity: merchants, traders, shippers, land
dealers, lawyers, capitalists, financiers, and professional
men. This fact is conclusively demonstrated by Dr. Libby's
study[^/1482] of the ratification of the Constitution and it is
illustrated by the following letters and papers written by
keen observers during the period of the struggle over the
adoption of the new system of government.

William Grayson to James Monroe.

New York, May 29, 1787.

The delegates \[to the Philadelphia convention\] from the
Eastward are for a very strong government, and wish to
prostrate all the state legislatures, and form a general system
out of the whole; but I don't learn that the people are
with them, on the contrary in Massachusetts they think
that government too strong and are about rebelling again,
for the purpose of making it more democratical: In Connecticut
they have rejected the requisition for the present
year decidedly, and no man there would be elected to the
office of a constable if he was to declare that he meant to
pay a copper towards the domestic debt:--- Rhode Island
has refused to send members --- the cry there is for a good
government after they have paid their debts in depreciated
paper: --- first demolish the Philistines, i.e. their creditors,
and then for propriety.

New Hampshire has not paid a shilling, since peace, and
does not ever mean to pay one to all eternity:--- if it was
attempted to tax the people for the domestic debt 500
Shays would arise in a fortnight.--- In New York they pay
well because they do it by plundering New Jersey and Connecticut.---
Jersey will go great lengths from motives of
revenge and Interest: Pennsylvania will join provided you
let the sessions of the Executive of America be fixed in
Philadelphia and give her other advantages in trade to
compensate for the loss of state power. I shall make no
observations on the southern states, but I think they will
be, perhaps from different motives, as little disposed to part
with efficient power as any in the Union.[^/165]

D. Humphreys to George Washington.

New Haven, Sept. 28, 1787.

All the different classes in the liberal professions will be
in favour of the proposed Constitution. The clergy, lawyers,
physicians and merchants will have considerable influence
on society. Nor will the officers of the late army be backward
in expressing their approbation. Indeed the well affected
have not been wanting in efforts to prepare the
minds of the citizens for the favorable reception of whatever
might be the result of your proceedings. I have had
no inconsiderable agency in the superintendence of two
presses, from which more newspapers are circulated, I
imagine, than from any others in New England. Judicious
and well-timed publications have great efficacy in ripening
the judgment of men in this quarter of the continent.[^/166]

Conjectures about the new Constitution by Hamilton, autumn, 1787.

The new Constitution has in favor of its success these
circumstances --- a very great weight of influence of the
persons who framed it, particularly in the universal popularity
of General Washington --- the good will of the commercial
interest throughout the states which will give all
its efforts to the establishment of a government capable
of regulating, protecting and extending the commerce of
the Union --- the good will of most men of property in the
several states who wish a government of the union able to
protect them against domestic violence and the depredations
which the democratic spirit is apt to make on property;
--- and who are besides anxious for the respectability
of the nation --- a strong belief in the people at large of the
insufficiency of the present confederation to preserve the
existence of the union and of the necessity of the union.
to their safety and prosperity; of course a strong desire
of a change and a predisposition to receive well the
propositions of the convention.

Against the success is to be put the influence of many
inconsiderable men in possession of considerable offices
under the state governments who will fear a diminution of
their consequence, power and emolument by the establishment
of the general government and who can hope for
nothing there --- the influence of some considerable men in
office possessed of talents and popularity who partly from
the same motives and partly from a desire of playing a part
in a convulsion for their own aggrandisement will oppose
the quiet adoption of the new government --- (some considerable
men out of office, from motives of ambition may
be disposed to act the same part) --- add to these causes
the democratical jealousy of the people which may be
alarmed at the appearance of institutions that may seem

calculated to place the power of the community in few
hands and to raise a few individuals to stations of great
preÃ«minence --- and the influence of some foreign powers
who from different motives will not wish to see an energetic
government established throughout the states.[^/1671]

James Madison to Thomas Jefferson. Dec. 9, 1787.

It is worthy of remark that whilst in Virginia and some
of the other states in the middle and southern districts of
the Union, the men of intelligence, patriotism, property,
and independent circumstances, are thus divided; all of
this description, with a few exceptions, in the eastern
states, and most of the middle states, are zealously attached
to the proposed Constitution. In New England,
the men of letters, the principal officers of Govt., the
judges and lawyers, the clergy, and men of property, furnish
only here and there an adversary. It is not less
worthy of remark that in Virginia where the mass of the
people have been so much accustomed to be guided by
their rulers on all new and intricate questions, they should
on the present which certainly surpasses the judgment of
the greater part of them, not only go before, but con.
trary to, their most popular leaders. And the phenomenon
is the more wonderful, as a popular ground is taken by
all the adversaries to the new Constitution. Perhaps the
solution in both these cases, would not be very difficult;
but it would lead to observations too diffusive; and to you
unnecessary. I will barely observe that the case in Virga.
seems to prove that the body of sober and steady people,
even of the lower order, are tired of the vicissitudes, injustice
and follies which have so much characterized public
measures, and are impatient for some change which
promises stability and repose.[^/1672]

H. Knox to Gen. Washington. Newyork, JAN. 14, 1788.

Colonel Wadsworth writes me that the present Governor
and Lieutenant Governor, the late Governor, the
judges of the Supreme Court and the Council were of the
convention and all for the constitution excepting Jas.
Wadsworth.

The Massachusetts convention were to meet on the 9th.
The decision of Connecticut will influence in a degree
their determination and I have no doubt that the Constitution
will be adopted in Massachusetts.--- But it is at this
moment questionable whether it will be by a large majority.

There are three parties existing in that state at present,
differing in their numbers and greatly differing in their
wealth and talents.

The 1st is the commercial part, of the state to which
are added, all the men of considerable property, the
clergy, the lawyers --- including all the judges of all the
courts, and all the officers of the late army, and also the
neighbourhood of all the great towns --- its numbers may
include 3[^/7]ths of the state. This party are for the most
vigorous government, perhaps many of them would have
been still more pleased with the new Constitution had it
been more analogous to the British Constitution.

The 2d party, are the eastern part of the state lying beyond
New Hampshire formerly the Province of Main ---
This party are chiefly looking towards the erection of a
new state, and the majority of them will adopt or reject the
new Constitution as it may facilitate or retard their de
signs, without regarding the merits of the great question ---
this party 2[^/7]ths.

The 3d party are the Insurgents, or their favorers, the
great majority of whom are for an annihilation of debts,
public and private, and therefore they will not approve the
new Constitution --- this party 2[^/7]ths.

If the 1st and 2d party agree as will be most probable,
and also some of the party stated as in the insurgent interest,
the Constitution will be adopted by a great majority
notwithstanding all the exertions to the contrary.[^/168]

In letters written by Rufus King to Madison dated in January, 1788, he said:

Our convention \[in Massachusetts\] proceeds slowly; and
apprehension that the liberties of the people are in danger,
and a distrust of men of property or education have a more
powerful effect upon the minds of our opponents than any
specific objections against the Constitution. ... The
friends of the Constitution, who in addition to their own
weight are respectable as they represent a very large proportion
of the good sense and property of this state, have
the task not only of answering, but also of stating and
bringing forward the objections of their opponents. The opposition
complains that the lawyers, judges, clergymen,
merchants and men of education are all in favor of the
Constitution --- and that for that reason they appear to be
able to make the worse appear the better cause. But say
they, if we had men of this description on our side, we
should alarm the people with the imperfections of the Constitution
and be able to refute the defence set up in its
favor. Notwithstanding the superiority of talent in favor of
the Constitution, yet the same infatuation which prevailed
not many months since in several counties of this state, and
which emboldened them to take arms against the government,
seems to have an uncontrollable authority over a
numerous part of the convention. These objections are not
directed against any part of the Constitution, but their opposition
seems to arise from an opinion that is immovable,
that some injury is plotted against them --- that the system
is the production of the rich and ambitious, that they discover
its operations and that the consequence will be the
establishment of two orders in the Society, one comprehending
the opulent and great, the other the poor and illiterate.
The extraordinary Union in favor of the Constitution
in this state of the wealthy and sensible part of it, is in
confirmation of these opinions and every exertion hitherto
made to eradicate it, has been in vain.[^/169]

Jabez Bowen to George Washington

Providence, Dec. 15, 1789.

The towns of Newport, Providence, Bristol, etc., with
the whole mercantile interest in the other towns in the
state are federal, while the farmers in general are against
it. Their opposition arises principally from their being much
in debt, from the insinuations of wicked and designing men,
that they will lose their liberty by adopting it; that the
salaries of the national officers are so verry high that it will
take the whole of the money collected by the impost to
pay them, that the intrest and principal of the general debt
must be raised by dry taxation on real estates, etc. We have
exerted our utmost abilities to convince them of the errors
that they have imbibed by hearing to the old Tories and
desperate debtors, but all in vain, what further, sir, is to be
done? if we knew what our duty was, we are willing to do
it, tho' I have no idea that the Antis will or can be induced
to come in without the arm of power is exerted and that
they shall be taught that the principles that they hould and
Disseminate among the citizens of the neighboring states as
well as this is inconsistent, and not proper to be professed
by any person or persons that live on the territories of the
United States: their wish is to overturn the whole Federal
Government rather than this state should submit to it. If
we fail in getting a convention at the next meeting of the
general assembly, will Congress protect us if we separate
from the State Government and appoint us officers to collect
the revenue; if this should be thought well of and
should be put in practice but in part I have no doubt but
it will bring the country part of the community to their
senses soon --- and that one town and another will be a
dropping off so that the opposition will be done away. Be
pleased, sir, to give me an answer to this proposition as
soon as convenient.[^/170]

On reading these papers by representative and thoughtful
men of the period, it is difficult to escape the conclusion
that the Constitution was looked upon as a bulwark against
populism of every form. Surely men of the type here
quoted as in support of the new instrument of government
must have rejoiced in the knowledge (spread abroad by
The Federalist) that an independent judiciary was to guard
the personal and property rights of minorities against all
legislatures, state and national.

Indeed, it would seem to be a work of supererogation
to argue such a proposition, were it not for the misleading
notions about the American political system which are all
too current. Every serious student of the history of our
public law and policy has known that the defense of the
rights of minorities against majorities is one of the fundamental
purposes of our system of government. "I have
thought," said Mr. Choate in his moving argument in the
Income Tax Cases before the Supreme Court, "that one of
the fundamental objects of all civilized government was the
preservation of the rights of private property. I have
thought that it was the very keystone of the arch upon
which all civilized government rests, and that this once
abandoned, everything was at stake and danger. ... If it
be true, as my friend said in closing, that the passions of
the people are aroused on this subject, if it be true that a
mighty army of sixty millions is likely to be incensed by
this decision, it is the more vital to the future welfare of
this country that this court again resolutely and courageously
declare, as Marshall did, that it has the power to set
aside an act of Congress violative of the Constitution, and
that it will not hesitate in executing that power, no matter
what the threatened consequences of popular or populistic
wrath may be."
