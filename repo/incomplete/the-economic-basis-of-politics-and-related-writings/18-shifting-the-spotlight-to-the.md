## Shifting the Spotlight to the American Scene

Compiler's note: Attention now turns from the European
theater (Part III) to the shores of the New World in
Part IV. Here material drawn from Beard's numerous investigations
of the economic aspects of American political
history is presented approximately in chronological order.

Writing of colonial times, Beard pointed out that "When
the representative system was transplanted to these shores
the old English practice of associating representation with
property came with it. To be sure, there were no estates in
Colonial America --- clergy, barons, and burgesses --- in the
legal sense, but there were men with different degrees and
kinds of property, to use James Madison's accurate phrase.
These people alone could vote and sit in colonial assemblies
in the great year of grace, 1776."[^/1471] As has previously
been reported (pp. 53--4), the same linkage of property
with representation is to be found in the first American
state constitutions.

Such was the political atmosphere in which the Constitution
of the United States was drafted. While property
qualifications for voting and public office did not find their
way into that great document, as Beard shows in Chapter
X, this certainly does not signify that economic considerations
were ignored by those who formulated it. Chapter XI
goes on to deal with some of the economic forces that
affected the vote on its ratification.[^/1472]

[^/1472]: Beard greatly amplified the story here presented in his An
Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United
States, Macmillan (1913). However, as the volume is still
(1956) in print, extracts from it have been purposely left out
of this compendium.

Beard's emphasis on economic factors influencing the
writing and adoption of the Constitution evoked a torrent
of criticism. In self-defense, he pointed out that those who
avoided such elements did not, in his opinion, go deep
enough. When discussing Theodore Clarke Smith's interpretation
that the formation and adoption of the Constitution
was "a contest between sections ending in the victory
of straight-thinking national-minded men over narrower
and more local opponents," Beard declared: "An economic
interpretation does not inquire whether men were straightthinking
or crooked-thinking. It inquires not into their
powers of mind or virtues, but into the nature and effects
of their substantial possessions. Nor is it necessarily in
conflict with Mr. Smith's conclusions. It pushes the inquiry
one step further than he does. It asks how it happened that
some men were national-minded and others were localminded,
and perhaps throws some light upon the subject."[^/148]

Chapters XIII through XX collectively pick up the
thread of American politics shortly after the national administration
was established under the new Constitution.
They start with the strong differences of opinion that developed
over the policies of the young government --- differences
which soon found expression in the first great and
enduring national party alignments. They then proceed to
carry the account down to the year 1928, with major emphasis
on the economic aspects of American domestic politics.
(For comments on domestic affairs in the period subsequent
to 1928, the reader is referred back to pp. 84 ff.)

Finally, Chapter XXI brings the text to a close with an
economic commentary on American foreign policy as it
stood shortly after World War I. This concluding material
appeared originally as a part of a series of lectures delivered
by Beard at Dartmouth College on the Guernsey
Center Moore Foundation in June 1922.
