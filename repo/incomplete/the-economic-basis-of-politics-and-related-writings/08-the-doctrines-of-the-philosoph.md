## The Doctrines of the Philosophers

The founders of this lectureship desire to help carry
forward the eternal quest of mankind for ways and means
with which to control its social destiny for noble ends.
Some of the most splendid traditions of the race are associated
with this search. The mystic Plato, the sagacious
Aristotle, the gentle Sir Thomas More, and the courageous
Condorcet, to mention none nearer our time, sought far
and wide for the key to the great mystery. The fruits of
their labors are a priceless heritage.

The imperious Burke likewise thought the theme worthy
of his talents, but he soon gave it up, confessing defeat. "I
doubt," he says, "whether the history of mankind is yet
complete enough, if it ever can be so, to furnish ground for
a sure theory on the internal causes which necessarily affect
the fortune of a state. I am far from denying the
operation of such causes: but they are infinitely uncertain,
and much more obscure and much more difficult to trace
than the foreign causes that tend to raise, to depress, and
sometimes to overwhelm a community. It is often impossible,
in these political inquiries, to find any proportion between
the apparent force of any moral causes we may
assign and their known operation. We are therefore obliged
to deliver up that operation to mere chance, or, more
piously (perhaps, more rationally), to the occasional interposition
and irresistible hand of the Great Disposer." In
short, confronted by the complex and bewildering facts of
social life, Burke cries aloud, with the mediæval priest
overwhelmed by the horror of the Black Death: "Deus
vult."

In the field of natural science, such a confession is a
plea of intellectual bankruptcy. In that sphere persistent
and penetrating research, relentless and unafraid, brings
about the progressive conquest and subjugation of the
material world. Indeed the very research in mechanics and
chemistry that produced the machine age has torn asunder
the foundations of the old social order, released new and
terrifying forces, and now threatens the dissolution of society
itself. The present plight of the world seems to show
that mankind is in the grip of inexorable forces which may
destroy civilization if not subdued to humane purposes. It
may be that in the end we must, with Burke, confess the
futility of our quest. Even then we shall say with Heine:

>Also fragen wir beständig
>
>Bis man uns mit einer Handvoll
>
>Erde endlich stopft die Maüler,
>
>Aber ist das eine Antwort?[^/40]

So the eternal search goes on. At the very outset the
seekers are confronted by two conflicting theories concerning
the problem itself. These are summed up by John
Stuart Mill at the opening of his famous work on representative
government. According to one of them, government,
namely, human control, is merely a problem in invention,
of determining what is best and adapting our
means to the desired end. According to the other theory,
government is not a matter of human choice at all but an
inevitable, natural growth in which the purposes of man
have no part.

Each of these doctrines, we must admit with Mill, is
untenable if pushed to an exclusive and logical conclusion;
yet somewhere between them lies important truth. Long
the victim of material forces, man has, by taking thought,
made himself master of wind and wave and storm. May he
not, by taking thought, lift himself above the social conflicts
that destroy civilizations and make himself master of
his social destiny? Perhaps not; but as the human mind is
greater than the waterfall which it compels or the lightning's
flash which it confines, so the control of human
destiny is a nobler object of inquiry than the search for
material power. Even though every door be slammed in
our faces, still must we knock.


[^/40]: Compiler's note: Translated, the passage reads as follows:

And so we ask, and ask again

Without rest, until at last,

With a handful of earth they stop up our mouths.

But is that an answer?

As the theme is old, we, as humble students, must, of
necessity, first survey the conclusions of the great masters
who have gone on before. We must first find out what they
thought about the nature of the forces which are responsible
for the origins, forms, and changes of political institutions.

At the beginning of such an inquiry we face, of course,
the mighty Aristotle,[^/41] "the master of all them that know."
He rightly deserves to be called "the father of political
science" because he took it out of the sphere of utopian
idealism where Plato left it and placed it on the strong
foundation of natural history. As Oncken rightly says, it
was the use of the methods of natural science in his inductive
studies that enabled Aristotle to make his great
contribution to Greek thought. He was the son of a doctor
who had written many books on medicine and physiology
and he was himself no mean student of morphology and
anatomy. Moreover he combined practical experience in
politics with long and wide-reaching researches in the history
of human institutions. It is for these reasons, perhaps,
that Aristotle stood midway between those who thought
that human society was a mechanism to be refashioned at
will and those who accepted good and ill as fatalities of
the gods. At all events we know that he sought to combine
the idealism of ethics with the realism of historical research.

The most striking thing about Aristotle's Politics is the
sharp contrast which it presents to most modern books on
the same subject. The latter deal mainly with the structure
and forms of government, the machinery and methods of
elections, the powers and duties of public officers. The
texture of society itself is left to the sociologist. The production
and distribution of wealth, the foundations of human
life, are assigned to the economist.


[^/41]: Compiler's note: Aristotle (384--322 B.C.), philosopher of
Ancient Greece.

The reasons for this somewhat arbitrary carving up of
the social organism for the purposes of study are not difficult
to discover. Adam Smith and the older writers spoke
of "political economy." About the middle of the nineteenth
century, thinkers in that field were mainly concerned
with formulating a millowner's philosophy of society;
and millowners resented every form of state interference
with their "natural rights." So "political economy"
became "economics."[^/42] The state was regarded as a badge
of original sin, not to be mentioned in economic circles.
Of course, it was absurd for men to write of the production
and distribution of wealth apart from the state which defines,
upholds, taxes, and regulates property, the very basis
of economic operations; but absurdity does not restrain the
hand of the apologist.

To this simple historical explanation must be added another.
This is an age of intense specialization. Every field
of human knowledge is so vast that the workers therein
are driven, in their endeavor to see things as they really
are, further and further into the details of their subject.
They then easily forget the profound truth enunciated by
Buckle that the science of any subject is not at its center
but at its periphery where it impinges upon all other
sciences. So the living organism of human society as a
subject of inquiry has been torn apart and parceled out
among specialists.

Aristotle, in contrast, combines economics, politics, and
ethics. He considers the nature and function of the family
before he takes up the forms of state. He then moves to
the subject of property in its human relationships and
considers the limits of communism and individualism. He
rejects the former as impossible but he tells us that "poverty
is the parent of revolution and crime." At no time
does he lose sight of ethics. The aim of the family and of
property, as of the state, is the best life. Property as a
means of getting more property or as an end in itself is
inconceivable to him as a philosopher. Its aim is to enable
man to live temperately and well, and this aim should
determine the amount which each citizen ought to hold.


[^/42]: \[The history of the transition from "political economy" to
"economics" has not yet been written. It is, of course, far more
complex than my summary statements indicate.\]

Having surveyed the family and property and the production
and distribution of wealth --- the texture of society
--- Aristotle proceeds to the consideration of the forms and
nature of government, the causes of revolutions, and the
conditions which favor the best society of which human
nature is capable. How sound is this, how wise, how much
more scientific than our modern practice of dissection and
distribution among specialists! So the first conclusion to be
drawn from Aristotle is that he never for an instant
dreamed that ethics, politics, and economics could be torn
apart and treated as separate subjects. He would have said
of such pseudo-sciences with Ruskin: "I simply am uninterested
in them as I should be in a science of gymnastics
which assumed that men had no skeletons. It might
be shown on that supposition that it would be advantageous
to roll students up into pellets, flatten them into cakes,
or stretch them into cables; and that when these results
were effected the re-insertion of the skeleton would be
attended with various inconveniences to their constitutions."
Aristotle simply could not imagine a treatise on the
state that did not consider the whole man rather than a
highly hypothetical man --- man as a mere political animal.
This is apparent in his treatment of every phase of his
subject.

When he approaches the heart of the matter, namely,
the causes of variations in the forms of the state, he immediately
relates economics and politics. He declares that
there must "necessarily be as many different forms of government
as there are ranks in the society, arising from the
superiority of some over others and their different situations.
And these seem to be two, as they say of the winds:
namely, the north and the south; and all the others are
declinations from these. And thus in politics, there is the
government of the many and the government of the few; or
a democracy and an oligarchy. ... A democracy is a
state where the freemen and the poor, being the majority,
are invested with the power of the state. An oligarchy is
a state where the rich and those of noble families, being
few, possess it." In commenting on this laconic explanation
of the differences in the form of the state by reference to
differences in wealth, Aristotle's distinguished editor,
Jowett, remarks in an equally laconic fashion: "As the
poor or the middle class, or the notables predominate, they
divide the government among themselves."

As economic classes depend upon the character and distribution
of property, and as the forms of state turn upon
the predominance of classes, it would follow logically that
alterations in the form of state must have some connection
with the changing fortunes of classes. This is exactly the
conclusion Aristotle reached after he had considered the
forces and conditions which produce revolutions in the
affairs of nations. "Political revolutions," he says, "spring
from a disproportionate increase in any part of the state.
... When the rich grow numerous or properties increase,
the form of government changes into an oligarchy or a
government of families. ... Revolutions break out when
opposite parties, _e.g._ the rich and poor, are equally balanced
and there is little or nothing between them. ...
Revolutions in democracies are generally caused by the
intemperance of demagogues who either in their private
capacity lay information against rich men until they compel
them to combine (for a common danger unites even the
bitterest enemies) or, coming forward in public, stir up
the people against them. The truth of this remark is proved
by a variety of examples. At Cos the democracy was overthrown
because wicked demagogues arose and the notables
combined. ... The democracy at Heraclea was overthrown
shortly after the foundation of the colony by the
injustice of the demagogues which drove out the notables,
who came back in a body and put an end to the democracy."
There are collateral and incidental causes of revolutions,
but "the universal and chief cause" of revolutionary
feeling is "the desire of equality, when men think they are
equal to others who have more than themselves; or again,
the desire of inequality and superiority when, conceiving
themselves to be superior, they think they have not more
but the same or less than their inferiors; pretensions which
may or may not be just."

It can hardly be doubted that Aristotle, in spite of some
confusion of thought, looks upon the character and distribution
of wealth in society as the chief determining
factors in fixing the form of state. It is equally clear that
he finds the causes of revolutions in states in contests
among those who have much, those who have little, and
those who have no, property. This disparity in fortune is
the fundamental condition of which the demagogue avails
himself in order to stir up strife and overturn established
orders. Another commentator, Mr. A. D. Lindsay, observes:
"When we come to Aristotle's analysis of existing
constitutions we find that while he regards them as imperfect
approximations to the ideal, he also thinks of them
as the result of struggles between classes. ... And each
class is thought of, not as trying to express an ideal, but as
struggling to acquire power to maintain its position. ...
His analysis of the facts forces him to look upon them
\[the Greek states\] as the scene of struggling factions. The
causes of revolutions are not described as primarily changes
in the conception of the common good, but changes in the
military or economic power of the several classes in the
state."

Having come, by an inductive study, to the conclusion
that there is a fundamental relation between the form and
fortunes of the state and the character and distribution of
property among the population, Aristotle applies the doctrine
in his inquiry into "what is the best constitution for
most states and the best life for most men, neither assuming
a standard of virtue which is above ordinary persons,
nor an education which is exceptionally favored by
nature and circumstances, nor yet an ideal state which is
an aspiration only."

His opinion touching this point is clear and simple:
"Now in all states there are three elements; one class is
very rich, another very poor, and a third is a mean. It is
admitted that moderation and the mean are best, and
therefore it will clearly be best to possess the gifts of fortune
in moderation; for in that condition of life men are
most ready to listen to reason. ... Those who have too
much of the goods of fortune, strength, wealth, friends,
and the like are neither willing nor able to submit to authority.
... On the other hand, the very poor, who are in
the opposite extreme, are too degraded. So that the one
class cannot obey and can only rule despotically; the other
knows not how to command and must be ruled like slaves.
Thus arises a city not of freemen but of masters and slaves,
the one despising, the other envying. ... A city ought to
be composed, as far as possible, of equals and similars; and
these are generally the middle classes. Wherefore a city
which is composed of middle class citizens is necessarily
best governed; they are, as we say, the natural elements of
a state. And this is the class of citizens which is most
secure in a state, for they do not, like the poor, covet their
neighbour's goods; nor do others covet theirs, as the poor
covet the goods of the rich; and as they neither plot against
others, nor are themselves plotted against, they pass
through life safely."

When Aristotle takes up the problem of finding the best
material for a democracy he is no less insistent upon the
economic element as the fundamental factor. The safest
and most enduring form of democracy is, in his opinion,
that based upon agriculture. In such a state the people are
compelled to work hard for a livelihood, they have little
time for political intrigue and combinations, they do not
covet the property of others, and they will endure in
patience oligarchies or tyrannies if they are allowed to
work and are not deprived of their lands or cattle. Next to
an agricultural democracy, that of a pastoral people is best,
for those who live by their flocks are in many ways similar
to husbandmen and they are well fitted for war. The worst
and most dangerous democracy of all is that founded on
commerce, for there is no moral excellence in the employments
of traders, mechanics, and laborers. By virtue of
their economic occupations, they are turbulent, instable,
and easily the prey of demagogues.[^/46]


[^/46]: "The best material of democracy is an agricultural population;
there is no difficulty in forming a democracy where the
mass of the people live by agriculture or tending of cattle.
Being poor, they have no leisure and therefore do not often
attend the assembly, and not having the necessaries of life they
are always at work, and do not covet the property of others.
... Next best to an agricultural and in many respects similar
are a pastoral people, who live by their flocks; they are the
best trained of any for war, robust in body, and able to camp
out. The people of whom other democracies consist are far
inferior to them, for their life is inferior; there is no room for
moral excellence in any of their employments, whether they be
mechanics, traders, or labourers ... The last form of democracy,
that in which all share alike, is one which cannot be
borne by all states, and will not last long unless well regulated
by laws and customs. The most general causes which tend to
destroy this or other kinds of government have now been pretty
fully considered." Here Aristotle evidently refers to Bk. V.
ch. 5 where he ascribes revolutions in democracies to hatred
stirred by demagogues against the rich.

As Aristotle, first among the ancients, commands the attention
of every student of politics, so Machiavelli,[^/47] first
among the moderns, arrests our interest. Like his Greek
predecessor, he was a man of affairs and a painstaking
searcher into the history of political institutions. During
most of his active life he was in the public service of
Florence. He was familiar with the inner politics of the
turbulent Italian states. To experience in domestic politics
he added a knowledge of foreign affairs gathered from
many difficult diplomatic negotiations and missions. As his
voluminous writings attest, he was a profound student of
history, politics, and diplomacy.

When he writes of states founded upon the sword, his
task is simple. He has merely to reckon with military
forces and devices. When he deals with the origins of civil
principalities he follows in the path cut by Aristotle. "A
principality," he says, "results either from the will of the
people or that of the nobles according as one or the other
prevails. For the nobles, seeing that they cannot resist the
people, begin to have recourse to the influence and reputation
of one of their own class, and make him a prince, so
that under the shadow of his power they may give free
scope to their desires. The people also seeing that they cannot
resist the nobles, have recourse to the influence and
reputation of one man and make him a prince so as to be
protected by his authority."

In advising the prince, once established, how best to
maintain his power, Machiavelli warns him to take account
of the conflict of classes out of which political power
springs and to balance one over against the other, leaning
to the right or to the left as occasion demands. By this
shifting of affections the prince can cause the passions and
ambitions of each class to nullify those of the other and
so keep himself secure in power. In times of peace, even,
the prince should give attention to the balance of classes.
"As cities are generally divided into guilds and classes, he
should keep account of these bodies and occasionally be
present at their assemblies, and should set an example of
his affability and magnificence; preserving, however always
the majesty of his dignity."


[^/47]: Compiler's note: Machiavelli (A.D. 1469--1527), Italian
statesman.

If time permitted it would be interesting to survey the
political philosophies of Bacon, Raleigh, Harrington,[^/0481]
Montesquieu, Burke, and a score of other great men who
have speculated upon the origin, nature, and fortunes of
the state; but there is a limit to our enterprise. Students
familiar with their writings know how deep is the impress
of economics upon them.

Still there is one more philosopher of the Old World
who cannot be neglected. As we have, of necessity, examined
the opinions of Aristotle and Machiavelli, so must
we, of equal necessity, look into the writings of John
Locke.[^/0482] He was, in a serious way, the forerunner of the
American and French revolutions as well as the supreme
apologist for the English revolution of 1688. All the great
French critics of the old régime from Voltaire to Condorcet
were familiar with their Locke. His works were translated
into French for the benefit of those not familiar with his
native tongue. Everywhere in the English colonies in
America, students of politics were also acquainted with the
philosopher of the Glorious Revolution. From him Jefferson
drew both inspiration and guidance. Parts of the Declaration
of Independence are merely paraphrases of passages
in Locke's Twor Treatises on Government. Like
Aristotle and Machiavelli, this English thinker combined
literary pursuits with practical affairs, although it must be
said that his first-hand experience with politics is not to be
compared with that of the Greek or the Italian.


[^/0481]: More than a century after Machiavelli's death an English
writer, James Harrington, in constructing his model commonwealth,
Oceana, gave to idealists the same advice that Machiavelli
gave to the prince, namely that they should take into
account the fact that the forms and distribution of property in
society determine the nature of the state. "Dominion," he
wrote, "is property, real or personal; that is to say, in lands,
or in money and goods. Lands or the parts and parcels of a
territory are held by the proprietor or proprietors, lord or
lords of it, in some proportion; and such (except it be in a
city that has little or no land and whose revenue is in trade) as
is the proportion or balance or dominion or property in land,
such is the nature of the empire. If one man be sole landlord or
own three parts in four, the state is an absolute monarchy. If a
few or a nobility with a clergy be the landlords and overbalance
the people to a like proportion, the state is an oligarchy or
a mixed monarchy. If the whole people be landlords or the
lands are so divided among them that no man or aristocracy of
men overbalance the many then the state is a commonwealth or
anarchy." In short, political power follows property and it is
the function of the statesman to see that property is not too
narrowly concentrated, that a substantial landed class be maintained
as the basis or stabilizer of the state.


[^/0482]: Compiler's note: John Locke (1632--1704).

Both the origin and end of the state Locke finds in the
roots of property. "To avoid these inconveniences which
disorder men's property in the state of nature," he writes,
"men unite into societies, that they may have the united
strength of the whole society to secure and defend their
properties and may have standing rules to bound it, by
which every one may know what is his. ... The reason
why men enter into society is the preservation of their
property, and the end why they choose and authorize a
legislature is that there may be laws made and rules set
as guards and fences to the properties of all the members
of the society." As the origin of the state is to be found in
the requirements of property owners, so is the end of the
state to be sought in the same source. "The great and
chief end, therefore, of men's uniting into commonwealths
and putting themselves under government is the preservation
of their property."

As the preservation of property is the origin and end of
the state, so it gives the right of revolution against any
government or authority that invades property. Such is the
economic foundation of the ethics of revolt. "The supreme
power cannot take from any man part of his property without
his consent." If perchance this is done, the owners of
property, the people, have the right to cast off the old form
of government and to establish a new one that will observe
the ends of civil society. This will not be undertaken, of
course, for light and transient reasons, but when a long
train of abuses menaces the privileges of property and
person, the right of revolution may be exercised.

So far we have considered only Old World writers, and
according to methods of thinking cherished in many quarters
we might easily conclude that European philosophy
has no application to us --- a favored people who live in a
new dispensation of our own making. It cannot be denied
that the social and economic conditions of Athens, feudal
Europe, or the Stuart age were in many respects different
from those prevailing in the United States. Still, mankind
here, as in the Old World, must struggle for existence and,
allowing for the divergences in circumstances, we have no
reason for assuming that the economic laws which governed
in other times and other lands are without effect in
this fortunate country. Certainly the founders of the American
republic did not assume that in shaping our political
institutions they could break with the experience and philosophy
of the past.[^/50] That will be discovered by any one
who takes the trouble to read the records of the convention
assembled at Philadelphia in 1787 to frame the Constitution
of the United States.

Time does not permit even a casual survey of those
voluminous documents. Nor is such a general inquiry necessary.
By common consent it is recognized that James
Madison was "the Father of the Constitution." He was a
profound student of history and government. He kept the
most complete record of the debates in the federal convention
that has come down to us. He spent his long life in
public service and political activities. He was twice President
of the American union, and was intimately acquainted
with nearly all the great statesmen of his time.
He was the adviser of Washington and the confidant of
Jefferson. He knew at first hand the stuff of which governments
are made. To a study such as we are now making
his views are simply indispensable and he may speak for
his contemporaries.

In a powerful essay written in defense of the Constitution
of the United States --- Number Ten of The Federalist
--- Madison sums up his political science in such a clear
and concise form that no one can mistake his meaning.
The prime function of government, he says, is the protection
of the different and unequal faculties of man for
acquiring property. "From the protection of different and
unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of
different degrees and kinds of property immediately results."
This inexorable economic fact is the basis of political
fact. Madison goes on: "From the influence of these
\[different degrees and kinds of property\] on the sentiments
and views of the respective proprietors ensues a division of
society into different interests and parties. The latent
causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and
we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of
activity, according to the different circumstances of civil
society." Thus, in the opinion of the Father of the American
Constitution, politics springs inevitably, relentlessly,
out of economics. The sentiments and views which arise
from the possession of different degrees and kinds of
property form the stuff of so-called "political psychology."


[^/50]: Compiler's note: For specific consideration of this topic,
_see below_, Chapters X and XI, dealing with economic influences
affecting the preparation and adoption of the Constitution of
the United States.

After this statement of controlling principle, Madison
moves to his next fundamental problem, namely, the effect
of these differences in economic condition and in political
psychology on the government and its operation. Here too
he has no doubts. He admits that there are occasionally
fanciful and frivolous causes of internal disturbances but
he is quick to add that "the most common and durable
source of factions[^/51] has been the various and unequal distribution
of property. Those who hold and those who are
without property have ever formed distinct interests in
society. Those who are creditors and those who are debtors
fall under a like distinction. A landed interest, a manufacturing
interest, a mercantile interest, with many lesser
interests grow up of necessity in civilized nations and divide
them into different classes actuated by different sentiments
and views. The regulation of these various and interfering
interests forms the principal task of modern legislation,
and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary
and ordinary operations of the government. ... The
causes of faction cannot be removed. ... We well know
that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as
an adequate control."


[^/51]: "Faction" was the common term in the eighteenth century
for "political party."

Thus Madison holds that, owing to the nature of men,
unequal distribution of property is unavoidable; that in
every civilized society, there will be persons holding different
kinds and amounts of property; that from their holdings
will arise special sentiments and views; that from
these differing sentiments will arise contending political
parties; and that political parties will seek to accumulate
a majority and control the state. This danger, majority
rule, Madison said in the constitutional convention, was
especially grave in view of the inevitable rise of a landless
proletariat --- a vast class of propertyless persons likely to be
actuated by the same sentiments and therefore certain to
assault the rights of the propertied classes. To secure the
public good and private rights against the dangers of such
a majority party bent on attacking the property of the
minority, and at the same time preserve the spirit and form
of popular government, he concluded, was the object
toward which the framers of the Constitution of the United
States directed their skill and their energies.

In short, the fundamental purposes and ideals of a free
government in the New World, by the iron necessity of
circumstances could not be essentially different from those
of the Old World or the Ancient World. If government
here is different from government in other times and
places it is mainly because the forms and distribution of
property are different.

But it may be said that Madison was from a slave state
where political power did in fact result from the possession
of land and slaves and that he was reading into universal
politics the conclusions drawn from local accidents. Such a
conclusion would of course be unjust to the great Virginian
because all through his works there are the evidences of
erudition which mark him out as one of the most learned
men of his day. For a moment we may let the objection
stand and inquire what were the views of some leading
statesman and philosopher in the free North. Surely none
will object if I choose a man who long and honorably
represented the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the
Senate of the United States and who found imperishable
fame in the annals of his country, Daniel Webster. In a
speech of great cogency and learning, delivered in the constitutional
convention of his state in 1820, he defended
the distribution of representation in the Senate on the basis
of property. The principle of representing property, he
said, was well established by writers of the greatest authority.
Then he went on to expound his views with a
show of learning and philosophy not often displayed in
the American constitutional discussions.

"Those who have treated of natural law have maintained,"
he said, "as a principle of that law, that, as far as
the object of society is the protection of something in
which the members possess unequal shares, it is just that
the weight of each person in the common councils should
bear a relation and proportion to his interest. Such is the
sentiment of Grotius, and he refers, in support of it, to
several institutions among the ancient states.

"Those authors who have written more particularly on
the subject of political institutions have, many of them,
maintained similar sentiments. Not, indeed, that every
man's power should be in exact proportion to his property,
but that, in a general sense, and in a general form,
property, as such, should have its weight and influence in
political arrangements. Montesquieu speaks with approbation
of the early Roman regulation, made by Servius
Tullius, by which the people were distributed into classes,
according to their property, and the public burdens apportioned
to each individual according to the degree of
power which he possessed in the government. By this regulation,
he observes, some bore with the greatness of their
tax because of their proportionable participation in power
and credit; others consoled themselves for the smallness of
their power and credit by the smallness of their tax.

"One of the most ingenious of political writers is Mr.
Harrington, an author not now read as much as he deserves.
It is his leading object, in his Oceana, to prove,
that power naturally and necessarily follows property. He
maintains that a government founded on property is
legitimately founded; and that a government founded on
the disregard of property is founded in injustice, and can
only be maintained by military force. 'If one man,' says he,
'be sole landlord, like the Grand Seignior, his empire is
absolute. If a few possess the land, this makes the Gothic
or feudal constitution. If the whole people be landlords,
then it is a commonwealth.' 'It is strange,' says an ingenious
person in the last century, 'that Harrington should be the
first man to find out so evident and demonstrable a truth
as that of property being the true basis and measure of
power.' In truth, he was not the first. The idea is as old as
political science itself. It may be found in Aristotle, Lord
Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh, and other writers. Harrington
seems, however, to be the first writer who has illustrated
and expanded the principle, and given to it the effect
and prominence which justly belong to it. To this sentiment,
Sir, I entirely agree. It seems to me to be plain,
that, in the absence of military force, political power naturally
and necessarily goes into the hands which hold the
property. In my judgment, therefore, a republican form of
government rests, not more on political constitutions, than
on those laws which regulate the descent and transmission
of property. ...

"If the nature of our institutions be to found government
on property, and that it should look to those who
hold property for its protection, it is entirely iust that
property should have its due weight and consideration in
political arrangements. Life and personal liberty are no
doubt to be protected by law; but property is also to be
protected by law, and is the fund out of which the means
for protecting life and liberty are usually furnished. We
have no experience that teaches us that any other rights
are safe where property is not safe. Confiscation and
plunder are generally, in revolutionary commotions, not
far before banishment, imprisonment, and death. It would
be monstrous to give even the name of government to
any association in which the rights of property should not
be completely secured. The disastrous revolutions which
the world has witnessed, those political thunderstorms and
earthquakes which have shaken the pillars of society to
their very deepest foundations, have been revolutions
against property.

"The English Revolution of 1688 was a revolution in
favor of property, as well as of other rights. It was brought
about by men of property for their security; and our own
immortal Revolution was undertaken, not to shake or
plunder property, but to protect it. The acts which the
country complained of were such as violated the rights of
property. An immense majority of all those who had an
interest in the soil were in favor of the Revolution; and
they carried it through, looking to its results for the security
of their possessions."

In another address, equally cogent, delivered on the
anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims, Webster applied
the economic interpretation of politics directly to
American institutions. "Our New England ancestors," he
said, "brought thither no great capitals from Europe; and
if they had, there was nothing productive in which they
could have been invested. They left behind them the whole
feudal policy of the other continent. ... They came to
a new country. There were as yet no lands yielding rent,
and no tenants rendering service. The whole soil was unreclaimed
from barbarism. They were themselves either
from their original condition, or from the necessity of their
common interest, nearly on a general level in respect to
property. Their situation demanded a parcelling out and
division of the lands, and it may be fairly said that this
necessary act fixed the future frame and form of their
government.[^/55] The character of their political institutions.
was determined by the fundamental laws respecting property.
... The consequence of all these causes has been a
great subdivision of the soil and a great equality of condition;
the true basis, most certainly, of popular government."

Having thus laid the foundations of politics in economics,
Webster went on to give a warning and a prophecy.
"The freest government," he said, "if it could exist,
would not be long acceptable, if the tendency of the laws
were to create a rapid accumulation of property in few
hands and to render the great mass of the population dependent
and penniless. In such a case, the popular power
must break in upon the rights of property, or else the
influence of property must limit and control the exercise
of popular power. Universal suffrage, for example, could
not long exist in a community where there was great inequality
of property. The holders of estates would be
obliged in such case either in some way to restrain the
right of suffrage, or else such right of suffrage would ere
long divide the property."


[^/55]: Italics are Webster's own.

It is to be regretted that time does not permit the reading
of these remarkable speeches in full, but we may summarize
all of Webster's conclusions in the following manner:

1. The form of a government is determined (except
   where the sword rules) by the nature and distribution
   of property.
2. Republican government rests upon a wide distribution of property, particularly in land.
3. Government to be stable must be founded on men's
   interest.
4. Property to be secure must have a direct interest,
   representation, and check in the government.
5. Disturbances in countries arise principally from the
   conflict of groups resulting from variations in the form
   and distribution of property.
6. Universal suffrage is incompatible with great inequality of wealth.
7. Political wisdom requires the establishment of government on property and the control of its distribution
   through the regulation of alienage and transmission.

Far away in South Carolina, one of Webster's distinguished
contemporaries, John C. Calhoun, reached substantially
the same conclusions as he pondered upon the
rise and fall of states and the problems of statecraft. Like
his antagonist in the forum, he had his mind fixed upon the
instant need of things --- the defense of the special interest
for which he was the leading spokesman; but in his quest
for power he also sought for the inherent nature of things.
Quickly his penetrating glance shot through the texture of
political rhetoric to the underlying economic facts.

"If the whole community had the same interests," he
declared, "so that the interests of each and every portion
would be so affected by the action of the government, that
the laws which oppressed or impoverished one portion,
would necessarily oppress and impoverish all others,--- or
the reverse,--- then the right of suffrage, of itself, would be
all-sufficient to counteract the tendency of the government
to oppression and abuse of its powers; and, of course,
would form, of itself, a perfect constitutional government.
The interest of all being the same, by supposition, as
far as the action of the government was concerned, all
would have like interests as to what laws should be made,
and how they should be executed. All strife and struggle
would cease as to who should be elected to make and
execute them. The only question would be, who was most
fit; who the wisest and most capable of understanding the
common interest of the whole. This decided, the election
would pass off quietly, and without party discord; as no
one portion could advance its own peculiar interest without
regard to the rest, by electing a favourite candidate.

"But such is not the case. On the contrary, nothing is
more difficult than to equalize the action of the government,
in reference to the various and diversified interests
of the community; and nothing more easy than to pervert
its powers into instruments to aggrandize and enrich
one or more interests by oppressing and impoverishing the
others; and this too, under the operation of laws, couched
in general terms; --- and which, on their face, appear fair
and equal. Nor is this the case in some particular communities
only. It is so in all; the small and the great,---
the poor and the rich,--- irrespective of pursuits, productions,
or degrees of civilization; --- with, however, this difference,
that the more extensive and populous the country,
the more diversified the condition and pursuits of its
population, and the richer, more luxurious, and dissimilar
the people, the more difficult is it to equalize the actions
of the government, --- and the more easy for one portion of
the community to pervert its powers to oppress, and
plunder the other.

"Such being the case, it necessarily results, that the
right of suffrage, by placing the control of the government
in the community must, from the same constitution
of our nature which makes government necessary to preserve
society, lead to conflict among its different interests,
--- each striving to obtain possession of its powers, as the
means of protecting itself against the others; --- or of advancing
its respective interests, regardless of the interests
of others. For this purpose, a struggle will take place
between the various interests to obtain a majority, in order
to control the government. If no one interest be strong
enough, of itself, to obtain it, a combination will be formed
between those whose interests are most alike; --- each conceding
something to the others, until a sufficient number is
obtained to make a majority. The process may be slow,
and much time may be required before a compact, organized
majority can be thus formed; but formed it will be in
time, even without preconcert or design, by the sure
workings of that principle or constitution of our nature in
which government itself originates. When once formed, the
community will be divided into great parties,--- a major and
a minor,--- between which there will be incessant struggles
on the one side to retain, and on the other to obtain the
majority,--- and, thereby, the control of the government
and the advantages it confers.

"So deeply seated, indeed, is this tendency to conflict
between the different interests or portions of the community,
that it would result from the action of the government
itself, even though it were possible to find a
community, where the people were all of the same pursuits,
placed in the same condition of life, and in every
respect, so situated, as to be without inequality of condition
or diversity of interests. The advantages of possessing the
control of the powers of the government, and, thereby, of
its honours and emoluments, are, of themselves, exclusive
of all other consideration, ample to divide even such a
community into two great hostile parties."

It is evident from this review that the six great thinkers
we have brought under consideration were in substantial
agreement on the subject in hand. They believed that the
fundamental factors with which the statesman has to deal
are the forms and distribution of property and the sentiments
and views arising from the possession of different
degrees and kinds of property. Upon this generalization,
we rest one of two conclusions. We may, upon reflection,
decide that the distribution of property is the result of
changeless forces inherent in the nature of man, and that
the statesman is not a maker but an observer of destiny. Or
we may hold that once the forces of social evolution are
widely understood man may subdue them to his purposes.
He may so control the distribution of wealth as to establish
an ideal form of society and prevent the eternal struggle of
classes that has shaken so many nations to their foundations.
Man, the servant of fate, may become the master.
But here we pause. Can the spirit of man be permanently
enclosed in any system?
