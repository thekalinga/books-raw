## Economic Groups and the Structure of the State

Having surveyed the theories of our six political philosophers,
it is fitting and proper that we should inquire
whether there has been in fact a close relation between the
structure of the state and the economic composition of
society. It would be interesting, if time permitted, to examine
the constitution of Athens and to consider such
matters as Draco's legislation and Solon's reforms or to
analyze the illuminating pages in which Polybius describes
the balance of powers in Rome. The results of such a
study, pondered in connection with the theories we have
just reviewed, could not fail to set in train a fascinating
line of speculation. There are, however, limits to this
undertaking, and we must confine our scrutiny to the
modern state in its historical growth.

In reviewing the history of government in Western
Europe, from the disintegration of the Roman Empire to
the opening years of the nineteenth century, we discover
that wherever the simple sword-won despotism of the
war leader, prince or king, is supplemented or superseded
by some form of representation, it is not the people, considered
as abstract equal personalities, who are represented,
but it is propertied groups, estates. We are told
by that profound student of mediæval law, Dr. Stubbs,
that the ideal toward which Europe was slowly working
in the middle ages, was a constitution under which each
class was admitted to a share of power and control, and
national action determined by the balance of forces thus
combined.

This was not, as he admits, a conscious design by which
statesmen shaped their policies. Many forces and circumstances
contributed to the making of the representative
system of estates. Sometimes it was the resistance of a
particular economic group to royal despotism that won
for it a recognized share in the government. An example of
this is afforded by the contest which ended in the grant
of Magna Carta.[^/61] The barons wrote their interest into the
public law of England, and secured it by obtaining the
right of actual participation as a class in the control of
government. At other times kings, especially during wars
of conquest or defense, found themselves straitened for
funds, and they called upon certain classes or groups of
men to fill their treasury. Such, for instance, was the
origin of the English House of Commons. To the continued
financial necessity of English kings, particularly
during the long war with France, was due the extraordinary
development in the power of the English Parliament.
Whatever the circumstances in each particular case, the
striking fact is that we find all over medieval Europe
what Dr. Stubbs calls "National assemblies composed of
properly arranged and organized classes."

If we examine the constitution of England in the middle
ages we find, in fact whatever the theory, four estates: the
clergy, the baronage, the landed gentry, and the burgesses.
Of these, the first three were founded, in the main, upon
landed property. The first or spiritual estate in the English
constitution comprised the whole body of the clergy. The
clergy were invited to form a part of Parliament for two
reasons. Their spiritual power was great, and even the
boldest kings did not dare to defy them until the days of
the mighty Henry VIII. But it is hardly to be doubted that
it was as holders of property of immense value that the
clergy came to a large share of the sovereign power. The
bishops and the abbots, who were summoned to Parliament
by name, were tenants-in-chief of the crown; in
other words, they were great landed barons. As such they
sat in the House of Lords. The inferior clergy in England,
unlike their French brethren, though duly summoned to
take their place in the great council of the realm, refused
to obey the summons and remained for centuries in a
convocation of their own, voting taxes on their property
independent of the Parliaments of the realm. Though the
clerical order was thus divided, the high authorities of the
church sitting in the House of Lords and the inferior
clergy dealing with the crown directly, it was mainly as a
body of landed proprietors that the spiritual estate shared
in the government.


[^/61]: Compiler's note: by King John, in A.D. 1215.

The second English estate was the lay baronage, the
members of which sat by their own right in the House of
Lords along with the spiritual peers from the clerical estate.
It is not necessary to inquire here into the historical
circumstances which resulted in drawing a line between the
richer barons and the untitled landed gentry, nor into
those vainly disputed points of law which have been
raised in the search for the origin and exact nature of the
property rights which entitled a peer to a seat in the
upper House. Whatever the cause may have been, the fact
clearly stands forth, as Dr. Stubbs says, that in the middle
ages the great land owners, tenants-in-chief, or titled lords,
who appeared in person at the Parliament, were separated
by a broad line from the freeholders who were represented
by the knights of the shire.

According to a custom consecrated by time, it is the
fashion to speak of the House of Commons as representing
a sort of third estate, the commonalty of the realm. A little
antiquarian inquiry, however, shows that the term "Commons"
does not derive its meaning, as is often erroneously
supposed, from any connection with "the common
people." On the contrary it comes from the vague word
communitas which was used in the middle ages to describe
a political organism such as a county or chartered town.
The House of Commons, therefore, was in reality the
house of the communitates, composed of representatives
of the gentry of the counties and the burgesses of the
towns considered as collective bodies within their respective
geographical areas. Strictly speaking, we find in
the lower house of Parliament the spokesmen of two
estates: the smaller landowners and the burgesses. In the
early stages of parliamentary evolution, the agents sent by
the burgesses were even treated as a separate house or
estate, although the way in which they voted on measures
is obscure. Later they were combined with the gentry.

It was one of the peculiarities of the English system that
the Parliament was not constituted of three or four distinct
orders. In France, as we shall see, there were three
separate estates --- clergy, nobility, and third estate. In
Sweden there were four orders --- clergy, nobility, burghers,
and peasants. In both of these countries each order formed
a separate chamber and acted as a collective body. In
England, on the other hand, there were only two chambers
in the political system, unless we treat the separate convocation
of the clergy as a part of the political organism. The
House of Lords combined the great landed lay barons with
the great landed clerical barons. The House of Commons
included burgesses from the towns and representatives of
the landed gentry below the baronial line. Still, it is quite
apparent, in spite of these combinations, that the English
constitution of the middle ages was a group system, resting
upon a foundation of economic classes.[^/63]

The principles underlying this mediæval system of class
representation have never been entirely abandoned in
England in favor of the theory of abstract individual
equality. They were well understood by Harrington, Locke,
and Burke. Indeed the British constitution of mediæval
origin remained substantially unchanged until 1832, when
the first of the great series of parliamentary reform bills
was enacted. Although nearly half a century had elapsed
since the French Revolution let loose its flood of liberty
and equality doctrines, English reformers, even in 1832,
remained unmoved. They widened the suffrage, it is true,
but what they did in effect was to enfranchise, by a set of
ingenious qualifications, another "estate" which had grown
up with the advance of industry and commerce, namely,
a body of middle-class manufacturers and shopkeepers. In
vain did the English Chartists talk of "one man one vote,"
and universal manhood suffrage.

When the next generation of English reformers "shot
Niagara," in 1867, they merely enfranchised another "estate"
--- the working classes of the great industrial centers.
And when again in 1884 a new addition was made to the
British constitution, another "estate" was enfranchised, the
agricultural laborers. At no point was the tax-paying or
property notion abandoned by the English in favor of the
rule that a man should be allowed to vote simply because
he is what Carlyle called "an unfeathered biped."


[^/63]: It must not be forgotten that the mediæval clergy had a
large vested interest in the profession. In addition to the huge
landed estates given by pious benefactors for religious purposes,
the clergy as a class had a large revenue from fees of various
kinds. Much of the opposition of the middle classes to the
Catholic Church was economic in origin.

After the era of individualism set in it was more difficult
to trace the line between economic groups than it had been
in the middle ages, but whoever reads the debates over the
great reform bills in England can see that statesmen, at
each period, had in mind not abstract human equality, but
what Dr. Stubbs characterized as a constitution in which
each class of society should be admitted to a share of
power and control. The significance of this story for the
political future of England, in view of the changed position
of women in industry, particularly since the outbreak
of the Great War,[^/0641] can readily be seen by one who has
eyes to see.[^/0642]

Everywhere in mediæval Europe, as in England, we find
constitutions resting upon estates, assemblies representing
various orders, classes, and conditions of men, except the
rightless serf at the bottom of society. In the Cortes of
Aragon sat the clergy, the great barons (ricos hombres),
the minor barons or knights, and the burgesses of the
towns. The old parliament of Scotland was composed of
prelates, barons, and the smaller townsmen. In the representative
assemblies which sprang up in some German
principalities and in Russia, the same idea of class representation
prevailed.

In the economic foundations of her constitution, mediæval
France differed in no fundamental way from the
neighboring countries. The history of the French estates,
local and general, offers to the student of political science
an abundance of group phenomena for analysis and interpretation.
The records of more than three hundred years
copiously illustrate the operation of the group process; an
added and very significant interest is given to the study by
the role of the Estates General on the eve of the great
Revolution.


[^/0641]: Compiler's note: i.e. World War I.


[^/0642]: This sentence may stand as written in 1916. Not until 1917,
during the great "War for Democracy," did England establish
a practically universal suffrage.

As early as 1212, Simon de Montfort called a parliament
to which he summoned bishops, nobles, and distinguished
bourgeois. A few years later, there was held
at Beziers an assembly of the three orders (des trois
ordres) to give advice relative to provincial administrative
organization. In 1254, by royal ordinance, the Seneschal
Beaucaire was instructed to take counsel with the prelates,
the barons, the knights, and the representatives of the
towns (hominibus bonarum villarum).

The first Estates General, or National Parliament, was
held in France in 1303. This was speedily followed by
other parliaments. Speaking of the session of 1308, a
chronicler said that the king wished to have the advice and
consent of men "of every condition in the realm."

Like all early national assemblies, the French Estates
General met only on the call of the king, and the methods
of election depended naturally upon the terms of the royal
orders. Complicated and varying practices were adopted at
different times and places, but the following general principles
were commonly observed. The members of the two
privileged classes, the high clergy and the nobility, were
summoned in person. The important convents and chapters
were invited to send delegates. Occasionally the regular
and secular clergy of a diocese united to elect their deputies.
The nobility of the lower order usually chose their
representatives, but sometimes members of this group appeared
in person. In the towns the delegates were elected
--- often under a widely extended suffrage, including, on
some occasions, women voters. These orders of society
were known collectively as the clergy, the nobility, and the
third estate.

It was not thought necessary, however, that each order
should be represented only by members of the group. In
medieval practice, on the contrary, clerks, nobles, curates,
and canons were sometimes chosen to represent townsmen.
Often laymen were selected to speak for the clergy. Again,
we see farmers (roturiers) and clergy standing as the
spokesmen for men of noble order. Again it happened,
perhaps to save expense, that the same deputies represented
clergy, nobility, and third estate. Whatever the process of
selection, however, each class acted separately and developed
a certain consciousness of identical interest. When,
in 1543, the king sought to unite the three groups in a
common election, he found that instead of mitigating the
group conflicts he only sharpened them. In a little while he
restored the old practice of separate elections.

The French Estates General continued to meet from
time to time until 1614, when the last grand session previous
to the eve of the Revolution was held. At this memorable
meeting there broke out a conflict between the
nobility and the third estate which foreshadowed the
struggle that was destined, more than one hundred and
fifty years later, to destroy the whole system. The violence
of this session, and perhaps the conflict then raging
in England between the Parliament and James I, served as
a warning that the monarch should beware of nourishing
a dangerous hostility among the national estates.

Whatever may have been the cause --- with that we are
not now concerned --- no session of the Estates General was
again called until 1788. In that year the king, being in
desperate financial straits, once more summoned the representatives
of the different economic groups, that could
give him relief, to consider the state of the realm. Immediately
the antiquarians busied themselves with historical
researches in order to restore the ancient and honorable
institution of class government in its old form.

To the Estates General of 1789, each estate --- clergy,
nobility, and third estate --- sent its members and representatives.
Then arose, as every one knows, a fateful struggle
for power. The clergy and nobility, bent on preserving their
dominion, insisted that the vote on measures should be
taken by the houses, as three distinct orders. Thus they
hoped to prevent the upper classes from being overwhelmed
by the numerical majority of the third estate,
which had twice as many representatives in the assembly as
the other two estates combined. Every school history tells
us of the deadlock which ensued, of Mirabeau's eloquence,
of the Tennis Court Oath, and of the National Assembly
which, by firm action, was substituted for the old threeclass
system. Had the clergy and the nobility been willing
earlier to surrender some of their privileges, and concede
to the third estate a fair portion of political power, the
history of the desperate years that followed the peaceful
revolution of 1789 might have been far different. By
resisting to the breaking point, the clergy and the nobility
were conquered and almost destroyed by the third estate.

Less significant for the history of the world, but by no
means less interesting in itself, is the parliamentary development
of Sweden. From very early times the constitution
of that kingdom recognized and provided for the
representation of four distinct classes, clergy, nobility,
burghers, and peasants. In the constitutional reorganization
which followed the disturbances of the French Revolution
and the Revolutionary Wars, this system was kept
intact. Each class was not only distinctly represented, but
each class had a house of its own through which the
interests of the group were expressed in the government.
The great landlords appeared in person. The spiritual
house included the bishops and a number of other persons
chosen by the clergy, the universities, and the academy of
sciences, respectively. The representatives of the middle
class were elected by the properly qualified burghers of
the towns and the mineowners. The representatives of
the peasants were chosen by the landowning farmers and
certain other members of the soil-tilling population. Each
of the four houses of parliament deliberated alone and
acted in the name of and for the class which it represented.
Ingenious provisions were devised for obviating
deadlocks. This four-class parliament was retained until
1866 when two houses took the place of the old system.

The principle of class representation, which had been
adopted in the development of mediæval governments,
was taken over entirely by Austria in her constitutional
reconstruction shortly after the middle of the nineteenth
century. The Austrian upper house consisted, of course,
of the nobility, whose economic foundation was the land.
In the formation of the lower house, in 1860--1, representation
was distributed among the several provinces of
the realm and it was provided that the quota to which
each province was entitled should be selected by the local
legislatures from definite economic groups.

It was stipulated that the total number of deputies to be
chosen should be distributed among four distinct "estates,"
namely: (1) the great landlords (except in Trieste and
Vorarlberg where no such class existed, and in Dalmatia
where the highest taxpayers were put into this group); (2)
the burghers of the cities, markets, and industrial places;
(3) the peasants of the rural communes; and (4) the
chambers of commerce. In 1873 indirect election was
abandoned for direct election by popular vote, but the
system of class representation remained intact. Twentythree
years later, that is, in 1896, the non-taxpayers and
industrial proletariat were admitted to a share in the
government. It was provided that seventy-two deputies,
now added to the parliament, should be chosen by the
voters in general, including those already members of other
classes. This system of group representation remained in
force until 1907 when manhood suffrage was adopted.

In formulating a constitution after the Revolution of
1848, the king of Prussia deliberately founded his government
upon a class system, as you all know from your
study of comparative politics. The voters of Prussia are
divided into three classes: those who pay one-third of the
income taxes elect indirectly one-third of the delegates to
the Prussian Diet; those who pay a second third of the
income taxes likewise elect a third of the delegates; and
finally, all the rest of the voters, who constitute almost the
entire electorate, choose the remaining third of the deputies.
Thus the Prussian Parliament is made up of a House
of Lords, representing the landed interests, and a House of
Commons or Diet, representing in two-thirds of its membership
the wealth of the kingdom, and in one-third the
propertyless. Years of agitation and a threatened revolt
on the part of the masses have failed to shake the foundations
of this strongly knit system of class government.[^/68]

All this, you may think, is interesting enough, but without
bearing upon American conditions. It may be said that
whatever were the practices of mediæval France, England,
Sweden, and Aragon, they have no meaning for the United
States founded under another dispensation. There stands
the Declaration of Independence with its immortal statement
that all men are created free and equal and that
governments derive their just powers from the consent of
the governed. Here is what seems to be a repudiation of
the whole notion of class or group interest in the process
of government; but when we turn from theory to fact
we find ourselves in the midst of mediæval forms and institutions.


[^/68]: So things stood in 1916 when these lectures were given.
This system was overthrown in the German Revolution of 1918. \[After the advent of Hitler in 1933 the equalitarian
political regime substituted for the old Prussian class government
was extinguished by force.\]

An examination of the first American state constitutions
reveals no abandonment of the Old World notion that
government rests upon property. Take, for instance, the
Massachusetts constitution of 1780 drawn by John Adams
and adopted after long and serious deliberation. In this
document we discover that no man could vote for members
of the legislature or for governor, unless he had a freehold
estate of the annual value of three pounds, or some
estate of the value of sixty pounds. Here is a distinct
recognition of two classes of property interests in the
government --- real property and personalty. To add further
security to the two orders or "estates" the constitution
provided that no one could be elected governor who
did not possess a freehold of the value of one thousand
pounds, and furthermore, that the senators should be distributed
among the respective districts of the state on the
score of the amount of taxes paid in each of them. It was
in defense of this last provision that Daniel Webster made
his famous speech in the Massachusetts convention of
1820, defending the economic basis of government. If
the Massachusetts constitution proved to be rather democratic
in its operations, that was, as Webster pointed out,
due to the wide distribution of property, not to any desire
of the Massachusetts Fathers to sacrifice the security of
property to a political shibboleth.

If we take a great middle state like New York, we find
that the constitution drafted in 1777 distinctly recognized
the existence of classes by establishing the predominance
of the farmers. It provided that the senate should be composed
of freeholders, and that none but freeholders possessing
one hundred pounds' worth of land could vote for
the senators or for governor. A slighter property qualification
was placed upon voters for the lower house-a
qualification which admitted freemen of the incorporated
towns, renters, and a few others, but kept out the lower
levels of the proletariat. This class system remained in
vogue until 1821. It was abolished then only against the
violent protests of many intellectual leaders of the time,
such as Chancellor Kent, who maintained that the rights
of property could be protected only when property was
frankly represented in the government, and that those
"without a stake in the country" should have no voice in
its politics.

The Fathers of the South did not differ from those of
the North. In the agricultural state of Virginia, where there
were few merchants and capitalists, the predominance
which the landed classes possessed in fact was also established
in right. Only freeholders could vote in that
state under the constitution of 1776, and this restriction
was kept in force for more than half a century. When a
vigorous but vain attempt was made, in the constitutional
convention of 1829, to abolish it, the freehold suffrage was
defended on the ground that the landed group was the
only secure foundation for government because all other
classes were variable and transitory in character, while the
possession of land furnished the strongest evidence of
permanent, common interest with, and attachment to, the
community.

Admitting the plain evidence of the first state constitutions,
that the wise founders of this Republic recognized
the place of property interests in political processes, it may
be said that the Constitution of the United States, drawn in
that period, nowhere takes into account the existence of
economic divisions. This is true, if we read merely the
language of the instrument and not the records of the
convention which drafted it. In the document itself there
are no provisions similar to those which appear in the
first state constitutions, placing landedand personalproperty
qualifications on the suffrage and officeholding;
but the omission was not made because the framers of that
immortal instrument were indifferent to the rights of property
or unaware of the influence wielded by economic
groups upon the course of government. Neither was it
because they disapproved of property qualifications, for
such existed in nearly every state in the Union. In fact,
property qualifications for officers and for voters were
proposed in the convention, but it was impossible to agree
on their precise form. Inasmuch as many of the troubles
under the Articles of the Confederation had arisen from
attacks on capital by state legislatures elected by freeholders,
and inasmuch as the convention was especially
eager to safeguard the rights of personal property, a freehold
qualification did not seem to offer an adequate
remedy. On the other hand, to impose a large personalproperty
qualification on voters would have meant the
defeat of the Constitution by the farmers who were, of
necessity, called upon to ratify it. Under the circumstances
the framers of the Constitution relied, not upon
direct economic qualifications, but upon checks and balances
to secure the rights of property --- particularly personal
property --- against the assaults of the farmers and the
proletariat.[^/71]

At this point we may summarize. Our six political philosophers
regarded property, in its various forms and distribution,
and the social groups which arise out of economic
processes, as the fundamental materials for the science of
government. We have seen also that the constitutions of
government of great nations were, for centuries, deliberately
fitted to the division of society into separate orders,
groups, and estates, each of which pursued a separate
calling and cherished its own sentiments about economic
interests.

This great fact stands out clearly, that through the centuries
--- down until our own day --- group interests were
recognized as forming the very essence of politics both
in theory and practice. Statesmen spoke of them, negotiated
with them, placated them, legislated for them, and
sought generally to secure the predominance of one or
the other or the balance of several against one or another.
At all events, statesmen spoke not of abstract men and
abstract rights, but of real men and real rights. What has
happened to sweep away the practices of centuries, to
challenge the philosophy of the world's greatest political
thinkers, and to introduce the rule of "the people" instead
of the rule of estates? Have the economic conditions of
the world been revolutionized, the estates and orders
abolished?
