## The British Industrial Revolution[^/1251]

\[Compiler's note: In a volume published in 1906, Charles
A. Beard made the statement that: "The general direction
of the political movements and legislation in Great Britain
during the last one hundred years has been determined by
the interests and ideals of the three great economic classes:
landlords, capitalists, and workingmen."[^/1252] Concentrating on
the influence of the landed aristocracy, then the capitalists,
and lastly the working class, Beard, in the following passages,
sketches some of the economic drives in British
politics during the transition from feudalism to the modern
factory system.\]

\[The Landed Aristocracy in Mediæval England\]

Viewed from ... an economic standpoint, agriculture
was of supreme importance ... on the eve of the Industrial
Revolution. ... In 1760, one-third of the workers
of England were agricultural laborers, and a large number
of those engaged in regular manufacturing industries continued
to work in the fields during certain portions of the
year. It is estimated that 3,600,000, out of a population of
8,500,000, lived in the country, and that their income was
£66,000,000, out of a total national income of £119,500,000.

On the eve of the Industrial Revolution ... the government
was in reality in the hands of a landed aristocracy
more or less subject to royal dictates. ... The various
classes, from the king to the serf, took their places in
society under arbitrary and hereditary contracts. The villein
was bound to the soil; the lord of the soil to his overlord
or directly to the king. However, at no time can we
say that this order was absolute. Irresponsible kings, anarchy,
foreign influence, the growth of towns and cities,
and the rise of an artisan class, had been shaking the
stability of the rigid fabric. Peasants' revolts, famines, and
the rise of a free laboring class had the same tendency, and
the commercial development, which began in the Tudor
Age, also contributed to the destruction of the feudal
organism. But by 1760 there had been no upheavals violent
and far-reaching enough to affect the general character
of the social hierarchy.

... The old view which regarded the whole system of
social inequality as the divine order from the foundation
of the world still held sway ... The mass of the people
lived, performed their work, and died in the position to
which they thought the Lord had called them, without
questioning the causes which gave them their position.
...

The whole social fabric was keyed together by the king,
upon whose personality depended law, order, international
relations, social and industrial changes. ...

\[King\] George III had wielded a wonderful power for
several reasons: (1) in the hands of the king rested the
power to bestow all the honors, preferments, dignities,
and positions which turn covetous politicians into sycophantic
supporters of the hands which give; (2) the privileges
and position of the peers were inseparable from those
of the crown, and the greater part of their support and
political influence was with the king; (3) but what was still
more important, and added most to the placing of unlimited
authority in the hands of the king, was the nonpopular
character of the House of Commons. In the first
place, the county representatives were nearly all under the
dominion of the county aristocracy; (2) the boroughs
which returned members were largely the property of peers
or under their control; (3) election work done on behalf
of the royal party was rewarded by positions and honor
in the government service; (4) bribery was open and cor
rupt, and there were even "borough brokers," whose business
it was to dispose of the right of representation at the
highest prices.

At the close of the eighteenth century the House of
Commons had 558 members, 354 of whom, according to
legal form, were returned by "less than 15,000 electors,
but actually on the nomination or recommendation of the
Government, and 197 private patrons, including many
peers." It is thus evident that the younger Pitt's declaration
had its foundation in fact: "This House is not the representative
of the people of Great Britain; it is the representative
of nominal boroughs, of ruined and exterminated
towns, of noble families, of wealthy individuals, of foreign
potentates." As early as 1653, Oliver Cromwell attempted
Parliamentary reform by increasing the county members,
giving representation to Leeds, Halifax, and Manchester,
and striking off small boroughs from the list. This laudable
reform was, however, canceled when the Stuarts were
restored to the throne. From the middle of the eighteenth
century Parliamentary reform was again pressed forward,
but without avail. The terrors of the French Revolution
frightened the governing classes in England, and it was not
until Napoleon was safe at Saint Helena that reform
measures were seriously taken up.

\[The Emergence of Capitalism and "Rugged
Individualism"\]

... The ancient doctrine of paternalism and state regulation
was still recognized as expedient and desirable, and
"though nominally free to move, both farmers and labourers
were practically fettered to the manor by their
ignorance and their poverty." The ancient theory of state
made for a fixed order of society, and held it to be the
duty of the government to care for the temporal, spiritual,
and eternal welfare of the individual, especially in so far
as these interests did not conflict with those of the privileged.
Under the old economic doctrine, wages were regulated,
and the quality and often quantity of wares determined
by the powers that were. Especially as the regulation
of wages and the guaranteeing of good quality of
wares suited the temporal interests of the "upper classes,"
the system hung on from age to age, until it was finally
broken by the sudden and vast movements of the Industrial
Revolution.

\[At\] the beginning of the Industrial Revolution every
branch of trade, commerce, and industry was hampered
and restricted by complicated regulations, while the majority
of the people were held in political bondage, and
national policies were determined in the light of mediæval
doctrines. The wonderful expansion of trade and commerce
which came with the great inventions broke the narrow
bonds of the old mediæval order; the aristocratic and
divine right foundations crumbled from beneath the institutions
of state and the industrial structure; and society
resolved into the chaos of unrestrained individualism in
every activity. ... The employment of land, capital, and
labor in any way to make the largest returns for the
"captains of industry" was recognized as legitimate, and
upheld by the learned writers on political economy. Individual
liberty was the battle-cry, and it is not to be
wondered at when we understand the folly of the old restrictive
doctrines which held on until the eve of the Revolution,
and when we remember that the new principles of
state control were not yet developed. The state was to be
a passive policeman, according to the new theories of the
sphere of legislative action, while workers and employers
were to be allowed full freedom in selling and buying.
Freedom from social and aristocratic dogmas, freedom
from restriction, marked the coming of the new industrial
order. ...

Following in the main the doctrines of Adam Smith, but
with vicious enlargements and interpretations, the economists
were opposed to placing new restrictions on the
rapidly developing industries. Having recognized the failures
and fallacies of the medieval trade regulations, they
were naturally antagonistic to renewing, in any form, state
interference. They strongly advocated the "enlightened selfinterest"
doctrine; they discovered natural law in the social
world holding the free laborer to perpetual bondage, and
the discovery was highly acceptable to the capitalists and
mill owners. Malthus wrote about "the misery arising from a
redundant population," and, suggesting a plan for the abolition
of the poor laws, said: "We are bound in justice and
honor to disclaim the right of the poor to support." The
reverend gentleman added: "If parents desert their child,
they ought to be made answerable for the crime. The
infant is, comparatively speaking, of little value to society,
as others will immediately supply its place." The
conclusions of the old school were, in short, that man is a
miserable, helpless creature here below, powerless to
change anything, and that nature would have to take its
course, starving, eliminating, and yielding up the hindmost
to his Satanic Majesty.

... Capitalism, unrestrained by Acts of Parliament,
and unhindered by public opinion, entered upon an era of
full freedom of contract and unrestricted competition, and
the results which followed upon the mad rush for wealth
supply materials for the pessimist and cynic who make
human nature a synonym for all that is mean and selfish.
Labor became a commodity to be bought and sold on the
market. Conditions of life became secondary to the production
of wealth. ...

As we have seen, the old domestic system of manufacturing
had perished, and "contentment spinning at the
cottage door" had become the dream of the poet. Instead
came the factory system, with its organized armies of
workers. Great factory buildings were rushed up by men
ignorant of the elementary principles of sanitation. One
who visits the Lancashire district today will see still standing
many of the old factories with their low ceilings, small
windows, and absence of sanitary arrangements. So wild
was the rush for wealth that nothing was thought of save
space enough to work the machines, and light enough to
enable the operator to tend them. In these dingy buildings,
choked with dust and worn with overwork, the English
freeman enjoyed to the utmost the blessed privilege of
freedom of contract. ... Bodily and mental comfort,
health, security from dangerous machines, and moral decency
were hardly taken into consideration by the "captains
of industry who were laying the foundations of
England's greatness."... The horrors of the industrial
conditions under unrestrained capitalism outrival those of
black slavery in America. If the English worker died of
starvation or was injured by accident in the mills, it mattered
not to the employer, for he was not legally liable,
and the worker's place could be supplied from among the
thousands ready to work for even a bare subsistence. On
the other hand, the body of the black slave was valuable
to his master. Starvation or injury which diminished his
power as a worker rendered him of less value to his owner,
who was thus financially interested, at least in some degree,
in the tolerable condition of his property. Contemporary
reports, resolutions, personal accounts, and the Blue Books
are so terrible that the reader today can scarcely believe
that such ghastly stories of inhuman and infernal treatment
can have a shadow of truth. For more than fifty years
the reign of terror held sway in the peaceful walks of
industry --- a reign of terror that rivals that of the French
Revolution, because it was so long, so coolly accepted,
and even defended by political economists and servants
of the Man of Galilee.

As early as 1795, Dr. Aikin noted that the invention of
machinery \[had\] ... called into the mills hands from all
parts, and particularly children for the cotton factories.
Millowners arranged with the overseers of the poor, and,
after inspection of the paupers, selected the best, and had
them shipped to the factories to wear their lives out as
slaves to machinery. There were even regular traders in
human flesh who acted as brokers in paupers for the mills.
As soon as the children were in the hands of the mill proprietors,
"they were simply at the mercy of their owners,
nominally as apprentices, but in reality as mere slaves,
who got no wages, and whom it was not worth while even
to feed or clothe properly, because they were so cheap,
and their places could be so easily supplied." These little
slaves worked day and night in relays, so that the beds
in which they slept never cooled, one batch following another
in turn for its share of rest in the filthy rag piles. In
the Parliamentary reports we read of children being
knocked down and beaten as many as ten times a day; of
boys working in heated glass factories, and being rewarded
for negligence or failure to please the brutal overseer
by severe beatings with irons. Children less than five
years of age were found at work in coal mines, while in
the pin factories, lads five years old were worked at full
capacity for twelve hours a day. The story of adult labor
is no less horrifying than that of child labor. Men and
women were often worked just as long as the utmost limits
of physical endurance would permit. ..."We hear of
children and young people in factories overworked and
beaten as if they were slaves; of diseases and distortions
only found in the manufacturing districts; of filthy,
wretched homes where people huddle together like beasts;
we hear of girls and women working underground in the
dark recesses of the coal-mines, dragging loads of coal in
cars in places where no horses could go, and harnessed and
crawling along the subterranean pathways like beasts of
burden. Everywhere we find cruelty and oppression. ..."

\[The Reaction --- The Rank and File Gain Political
Power\]

... During these sad years in the history of English
toil . .. the people were, fortunately, beginning to think
a little for themselves. It soon became evident to the
nation at large that unrestrained individualism in industry
had failed to give health, happiness, or decent conditions
of livelihood. The age of revolt was not far off.

... The conditions finally became so unbearable that
the people, who had no voice in shaping the public policy,
expressed their deep-seated resentment at the iniquities of
the new order in occasional outbreaks. Rick burning and
the destruction of machinery showed the determined spirit
of the times. Discontent and unrest were rife throughout
the North. The suspension of the _Habeas Corpus_ Act and
the Six Acts (1819) aimed at the suppression of sedition,
revealed the fright of the government, and virtually declared
England to be in a state of anarchy; while the socalled
Peterloo Massacre added fuel to the flames of civil
unrest. But it was not by riots and destruction of property
that the people were to secure control over their conditions
of life and labor. The work of individualism in striking
down and clearing away the old economic, social, and political
wreckage had been invaluable; but its failure to
secure to the people the barest comforts of life soon became
evident.

... When it became a physical impossibility to endure
this terrible state of affairs any longer, the agitation for
factory legislation began. However, the problem was approached
with "bated breath and whispering humbleness,'
for fear of trenching upon the sacred rights of freedom of
contract. Human life was nothing when measured against
the holy obligation of precedent. Factory legislation in
England has been brought about by curious forces. Philanthropists,
scheming politicians, men with moral and social
convictions, have joined with the workers in the struggle
for better conditions. The first step in the direction of legislative
control of the new industry was made in 1802. Terrible
as were the conditions depicted in reports and pamphlets,
they seem to have attracted little attention from the
general public until the spread of disease created alarm
outside the precincts of factories. Long hours, ill-ventilation,
filthy homes, scanty food and clothing, and total lack
of decent sanitary arrangements, led to the spread of epidemics
in the factory districts, and action on the question
could not be delayed longer without seriously involving
public health. ...

As a result of the agitation on the condition of factory
operatives, two years after the opening of the new century
a Statute was passed providing for the preservation of the
health and morals of apprentices and others employed in
the mills. This Act, which was passed largely through the
continued effort of Sir Robert Peel, was intended chiefly
to protect the little pauper apprentices. It reduced hours of
labor for children to seventy-two per week, and regulated
night work as well. ... Each apprentice was to secure
instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and to be
provided one suit of clothes a year. ... However, Parliament
could not undertake sweeping reforms owing to the
selfishness of millowners and the dense ignorance of operatives,
who had been taught to believe that a shortening of
hours was inevitably accompanied by a fall in wages. ...

\[A\] select committee of the House of Commons reported
in 1811 that "no interference of the Legislature with the
freedom of trade, or with the perfect liberty of every individual
to dispose of his time and his labour in the way
and on the terms which he may judge most conducive to
his interest, can take place without violating general principles
of the first importance to the prosperity and happiness
of the community ..."

In 1815, Robert Owen, the great and revered friend of
the toilers of the world, lifted his voice in public protest
against the iniquities of the industrial system. With him,
interference was not a question of "economic theory," but
one of human life. ...

Owen framed three proposals which he wished to have
embodied in a second Factory Act. ... For four years
Owen was at London attending the Parliamentary sessions,
fighting for the passage of the Bill against ignorance, prejudice,
selfishness, and personal abuse and slander. In 1819,
after Owen's original draft had been mutilated beyond recognition,
the Bill finally became a law. Owen tells us that
he learned some things during the agitation. To use his own
words: "My intimate acquaintance with these proceedings,
for the four years during which this Bill was under the
consideration of both Houses, opened my eyes to the conduct
of public men, and to the ignorant, vulgar self-interest,
regardless of means to accomplish their object, of
trading and mercantile men, even of high standing in the
commercial world."...

The new law forbade the employment of children under
nine in the mills, and limited the hours of work to twelve
a day, exclusive of mealtimes, for all between the ages of
nine and sixteen. The first Act had only made the state a
sort of a guardian for the pauper apprentices; but the Bill
of 1819 was "legislative interference between the free
labourer and his employer," which the opponents of the
measure considered "a violent, highly dangerous, and unconstitutional
innovation." It was certainly the first expression
of the new doctrine that the state ought to protect
the interests of the weaker citizens, and it opened the way
for the later restrictive legislation. ... In 1825, Saturday
labor was shortened, and penalties provided for breach of
factory regulation. These Factory Acts, however, did nothing
toward assuring certainty of employment and living
wages, and little toward improving the lot of the workers
in any but the cotton industry. Misery, starvation, suffering,
and degradation made up the common heritage of the
laborers, in spite of the factory laws. The spirit of unrest,
nevertheless, was abroad in the land. It became evident
that the people themselves must assert their authority in
the Halls of Parliament.

... \[Notice\] should be taken of William Cobbett, who
has been called the Father of English Radicalism. In 1816,
his Weekly Political Register was reduced from 1s. ½ d. to
2 d., and by this means cheap political information, good
and bad, was supplied to permeate the consciousness of
the people with the new principles of reform. Orators,
poets, writers, and pamphleteers were busy arousing the
working classes, and Hampden clubs were founded all
over the country for the purpose of pressing forward the
demands for the suffrage. Under the leadership of Lord
John Russell, such reform was again and again forced
upon the House, until in 1832, after two defeats, and in
spite of the bitter opposition of the House of Lords, the
clergy, the universities, army and navy, and the Inns of
Courts, the famous Reform Bill became law, and the tide
set in toward democracy. The conflict was not waged in
Parliament alone, however, for all over the country were
groups of men determined not to abate their activities until
the walls of political privilege were battered down. When
the second bill was rejected by the House of Lords, rioting
at once began in the large towns where the news had been
anxiously awaited. The third bill was finally passed by the
House of Lords, after threats from the prime minister, and
warnings from the king.

The enfranchisement of the middle classes in 1832
opened the castle of the privileged to the assaults of the
disinherited, and political history since that time centers
about the struggles for enfranchisement of the masses. It
is, however, well to bear in mind continually the significant
words of Sidney Webb: "None of these enfranchised
classes has ever sincerely desired to admit new voters to
share the privileges, and submerge the power which it had
won; but each political party in turn has been driven to
'shoot Niagara,' in order to compete with its opponents."
By the Act of 1832, 143 seats were taken from "rotten"
and small boroughs, and distributed among the new centers
of population.

In 1867, radical agitation and rioting forced the Tory
government to extend the electoral franchise in boroughs
to householders and certain lodgers, and to reduce the
county occupation franchise. In 1878, the tenement occupier
was enfranchised. In 1885, the agricultural laborer became
a "sovereign voter." The decentralizing local government
acts of 1888--1894 have opened the way for local
autonomy. Thus within the past one hundred years the
world has witnessed a silent revolution in English politics,
which has resulted in the vesting of power in the hands of
the people.

... The first Parliament after the Reform of 1832 took
up, among other things, the thread of factory legislation
which had been dropped in the struggles over the franchise.
In 1833--34, an important Act was passed which applied to
all textile industries. The labor of children between the
ages of nine and thirteen was limited to forty-eight hours,
and that of young persons between thirteen and eighteen
to sixty-nine hours per week. Night work for the young
was forbidden, and ten hours a day made the limit for
children in the silk mills. This Act met with a storm of
opposition on the part of capitalists and millowners, but
it did not prevent the conviction of one out of every eleven
of the millowners for failure to observe its provisions. In
1842, the employment of women and children in underground
work was forbidden. By the famous Ten Hours Act
of 1847, and its supplement in 1850, the labor of women
and children was restricted to ten hours a day. Since the
labor of women and children could not be shortened without
closing the mills where they were employed, the Ten
Hours Bill practically applied to men also, and ten hours a
day thus became the general rule for factories. ...

After the breach was once made in the solid ranks of the
individualists, and the desirability of collective action became
apparent, act after act was passed curtailing the
sphere of individual enterprise, and subjecting private gain
to the welfare of society at large ... The battle has been
long and hard, and even now only the first redoubts are
in possession of the people. The power is theirs, however,
but they will progress only so far as their intelligence and
character will permit. ...

... When the Industrial Revolution made capital and
machinery relatively more important than labor, there was
developed a large class of workers doomed by necessity to
remain employees all their lives. The mediæval guild regulations
were without avail, and in the chaos of the beginning
of the new order there were no generally recognized
principles of organization. The workers were not
only compelled to accept the bondage, with its shocking
conditions as to hours and wages, but they were also forbidden
to combine for mutual assistance and for the
defense of a standard of life. In addition to the Law of
Settlement which, though intended for paupers, actually
prevented laborers from going from one parish to another
in search of work, in 1799 and 1800 acts were passed
definitely forbidding workmen to combine for the purpose
of securing better conditions. Agitation carried on by
Francis Place, assisted by Joseph Hume and J. R. Mulloch,
succeeded in forcing a repeal of the restrictive laws in
1824; but the strikes and disorders which followed frightened
the government, and Parliament passed an Act
rendering illegal any action arising from the deliberations
of the unions. ... It was not, however, until 1871--76
that unions were placed on a legal basis.
