## Some Political Aspects of the American Industrial Revolution[^/219]

Long before the Civil War, steam and machinery had
begun to invade American industries. ... The census of
1860 reported nearly a million and a half wage earners in
the United States, and more than a billion dollars invested
in manufacturing. By that year over thirty thousand miles
of railway had been constructed, including such important
lines as the New York Central, the Erie, the Baltimore
and Ohio, and the Pennsylvania. ...

But the spectacular conflict over slavery prevented the
political results of the economic transformation from
coming to the surface. Those who had occasion to watch
the proceedings of Congress during the two decades just
before the \[Civil\] War discovered the manipulations of
railway corporations seeking land grants and privileges
from the federal government and the operations of the
"protected" interests in behalf of increased tariffs. Those
were also harvest days for corporations and companies in
the state legislatures where special charters and privileges
were being bartered away by the wholesale. There was
emerging in a number of the larger industrial centers a
small, though by no means negligible, labor movement.
But the slavery issue overshadowed everything. The annexation
of Texas, slavery in the territories, the Compromise
of 1850, the Nebraska bill, and Bleeding Kansas
kept the mind of the North from the consideration of the
more fundamental economic problems connected with the
new order. The politicians, to be sure, did not live by the
slavery agitation alone, but it afforded the leading topics:
for public discussion and prevented the critical from inquiring
too narrowly into the real staples of politics.


[^/219]: A composite of Chapters II and III of Contemporary
American History, 1877--1913, The Macmillan Co. (1914).

The Civil War sharply shifted the old scenery of politics.
It gave a tremendous impetus to industry and railway construction.
The tariff measures during the war gave to
manufacturers an unwonted protection against foreign
competition; the demand for war supplies, iron, and
steel, railway materials, textiles, and food supplies, quickened
every enterprise in the North; the great fortuness
made out of speculations in finances, contracts for government
supplies, and land grants placed an enormouss
capital in private hands to carry forward business after the
war was over.

Within little more than a quarter of a century the advance
of industry and commerce had made the United
States of Lincoln's day seem small and petty. The censuss
of 1905 showed over twelve billion dollars invested im
factories and nearly five and one-half million wage earnerss
employed. In that year, the total value of manufacturedi
products was over fourteen billion dollars --- fifteen timess
the amount turned out in 1860. ...

The building of railways more than kept pace with the
growth of the population and the increase in manufac--
turing. There were 30,000 miles of lines in 1860; 52,000)
in 1870; 166,000 in 1890; and 242,000 in 1910. Begin--
ning at first with the construction of lines between stra--
tegic centers like Boston and Albany, and Philadelphia
and Reading, the leaders in this new enterprise grew more:
bold. They pushed rapidly into the West where there were
no cities of magnitude and no prospect of developing a
profitable business within the immediate future. Capitall
flowed into the railways like water; ... and the whole
West was aflame with dreams of a new Eldorado to be
created by transportation systems.

It must not be thought that this rapid railway expansion
was due solely to private enterprise, for, as has been the
standing custom in American politics, the cost of doubtful
or profitless undertakings was thrown as far as possible
upon the public treasury. Up to 1872, the federal
government had granted in aid of railways 155,000,000
acres of land, an area estimated as "almost equal to the
New England states, New York, and Pennsylvania combined;
nineteen different states had voted sums aggregating
two hundred million dollars for the same purpose;
and municipalities and individuals had subscribed several
hundred million dollars to help railway construction." To
the Union Pacific concern alone the federal government
had granted a free right of way through public lands,
twenty sections[^/221] of land with each mile of railway, and a
loan up to fifty million dollars secured by a second mortgage
on the company's property. The Northern Pacific
obtained lands which a railway official estimated to be
worth enough "to build the entire railroad to Puget Sound,
to fit out a fleet of sailing vessels and steamers for the
China and India trade and leave a surplus that would roll
up into the millions." Cities, townships, counties, and
states voted bonds to help build railways within their limits
or granted rights of way and lands, in addition, with a
lavish hand.

The chronicle of all the frauds connected with the
manipulation of land grants to railways and the shameless
sale of legal privileges cannot be written, because in most
instances no tangible records have been left. Perhaps the
most notorious of all was the Crédit Mobilier scandal
connected with the Union Pacific. The leading stockholders
in that company determined to secure for themselves
a large portion of the profits of construction, which
were enormous on account of the prodigal waste; and they
organized a sham concern known as the Crédit Mobilier
in which they had full control and to which the construction
profits went. Inasmuch as the federal government,
through its grants and loans, was an interested party that
might interfere at any time, the concern, through its agent
in Congress, Oakes Ames, a representative from Massachusetts,
distributed generous blocks of stock to "approachable"
Senators and Representatives. News of the transaction
leaked out, and a Congressional investigation in
1872 showed that a number of men of the highest standing,
including Mr. Colfax, the Vice-President, were deeply
implicated. Nothing was done, however; the leading cont
spirator, Ames, was merely censured by the House, ance
the booty, for the most part, remained in the hands o
those connected with the scandal. When the road was com
plete, "it was saddled with interest payments on $27,000,-,
000 first mortgage bonds, $27,000,000 government bonds
$10,000,000 income bonds, $10,000,000 land grant bonds
and if anything were left, dividend payments on $36,000,-,
000 of stock."

It would be easy to multiply figures showing astounding
gains in industry, business, foreign trade, and railways;
or to multiply stories of scandalous and unfair practices on
the part of financiers, but we are not primarily concerned
here with the technique of inventions or the history of
promotion.[^/222] The student of social and political evolution
is concerned rather with the effect of such material changes:
upon the structure of society, that is, with the rearrangements
of classes and the development of new groups
of interests, which are brought about by altered methods of
gaining a livelihood and accumulating fortunes. It is this
social transformation that changes the relation of the
individual to the state and brings new forces to play in the
struggle for political power. The social transformation
which followed the Civil War embraced the following
elements.

In the first place, capital, as contrasted with agriculture,
increased enormously in amount and in political influence.
Great pecuniary accumulations were thenceforward
made largely in business enterprise --- including the
work of the entrepreneur, financier, speculator, and manipulator
under that general term. Inevitably, the most
energetic and the keenest minds were attracted by the
dominant mode of money-making. Agricultural regions
were drained of large numbers of strenuous and efficient
men, who would otherwise have been their natural leaders
in politics. To these were added the energetic immigrants
from the Old World. That forceful, pushing, dominating
section of society historically known as the "natural aristocracy"
became the agent of capitalism. The scepter of
power now passed definitely from the masters of slaves
to the masters of "free laborers." The literary and professional
dependents of the ruling groups naturally came to
the defense of the new order.[^/223] The old contest between
agrarianism and capitalism now took on a new vigor. ...


[^/222]: Compiler's note: The footnote inserted here in the origi
nal text listed numerous inventions. It has been omitted.

... Senators of the old school, Clay, Webster, Calhoun,
Roger Baldwin, John P. Hale, James Mason, and Jefferson
Davis, were succeeded by the apostles of the new order:
Roscoe Conkling and Thomas Platt, James Donald Cameron,
Leland Stanford, George Hearst, Arthur P. Gorman,
William D. Washburn, John R. McPherson, Henry B.
Payne, Matthew S. Quay, Philetus Sawyer, John H. Mitchell,
and James G. Blaine. The new Senate was composed
of men of affairs --- practical men, who organized gigantic
enterprises, secured possession of natural resources and
franchises, collected and applied capital on a large scale to
new business undertakings, built railways, established cities
with the advancing line of the western frontier --- or represented
such men as counsel in the courts of law. ...

The political philosophy of this notable group of political
leaders was that of their contemporaries in England,
the Cobden-Bright school. They believed in the widest
possible extension of the principle of private property, and
the narrowest possible restriction of state interference, except
to aid private property to increase its gains. They held
that all of the natural resources of the country should be
transferred to private hands as speedily as possible, at a
nominal charge, or no charge at all, and developed with
dashing rapidity. They also believed that the great intangible
social property created by community life, such
as franchises for street railways, gas, and electricity, should
be transformed into private property. They supplemented
their philosophy of property by a philosophy of law and
politics, which looked upon state interference --- except to
preserve order, and aid railways and manufacturers in their
enterprises --- as an intrinsic evil to be resisted at every
point, and they developed a system of jurisprudence which,
as Senators having the confirming power in appointments
and as counsel for corporations before the courts of the
United States, they succeeded in transforming into judicial
decisions. Some of them were doubtless corrupt, as was
constantly charged, but the real explanation of their resistance
to government intervention is to be found in their
philosophy, which, although consonant with their private
interests, they identified with public good. ...


[^/223]: For the keenest analysis of this social transformation, see
Veblen, Theory of the Leisure Class and Theory of Business
Enterprise.

Inasmuch as the attacks on private rights in property,
franchises, and corporate privileges came principally from
the state legislatures, it was necessary to find some way
to subject them to legal control --- some juristic process for
translating laissez faire into a real restraining force. ...

The problem of how best to check the assaults of state
legislatures on vested rights ... was one of the first concerns
of the Convention of 1787 which drafted the original
Constitution of the United States, and it was thought by
the framers that security had been attained by forbidding
states to emit bills of credit and make laws impairing the
obligation of contract. Under Chief Justice Marshall, these
clauses were so generously interpreted as to repel almost
any attack which a state legislature might make on acquired
rights. However, in the closing years of Marshall's
service, the Supreme Court, then passing into the hands of
states'-rights justices, rendered an opinion in the case
of Ogden v. Saunders, which clearly held that the contract
clause did not prevent the legislature from stipulating that
future contracts might be practically at its mercy. When a
legislature provides by general law that all charters of
corporations are subject to repeal and alteration, such
provision becomes a part of all new contracts. Marshall
delivered in this case a vigorous and cogent dissenting
opinion in which he pointed out that the decision had in
effect destroyed the virtue of the obligation of contract
clause.

The case of Ogden v. Saunders was decided in 1827.
Between that year and the Civil War the beginnings of
corporate enterprise were securely laid in the United
States; and the legislatures of the several states began the
regulation of corporations from one motive or another,
sometimes for the purpose of blackmailing them and sometimes
for the laudable purpose of protecting public interests.
At all events, large propertied concerns began to feel
that they could not have a free hand in developing their
enterprises or enjoy any genuine security unless the legislatures
of the states were, by some constitutional provision,
brought again under strict federal judicial control.

The opportunity to secure this judicial control was afforded
during the Civil War when the radical Republicans
were demanding federal protection for the newly emancipated
slaves of the South. The drastic legislation relative
to Negroes adopted by the Southern states at the close of
the war showed that even in spite of the Thirteenth
Amendment a substantial bondage could be re-established
under the color of criminal, apprentice, and vagrant legislation.
The friends of the Negroes, therefore, determined
to put the substantial rights of life, liberty, and property
beyond the interference of state legislatures forever, and
secure to all persons the equal protection of the law.

Accordingly, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted,
enunciating the broad legal and political doctrine that no
state "shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens
of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any
person of life, liberty, or property without due process of
law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the law."

Here was a restriction laid upon state legislatures which
might be substantially limitless in its application, in the
hands of a judiciary wishing to place the broadest possible
interpretation upon it. What are privileges and immunities?
What are life, liberty, and property? What is due process
of law? What is the equal protection of the law? Does the
term "person" include not only natural persons but also
artificial persons, namely, corporations? That the reconstruction
committee of Congress which framed the instrument
intended to include within the scope of this generous
provision not only the Negro struggling upward from
bondage, but also corporations and business interests struggling
for emancipation from legislative interference, has
been often asserted. In arguing before the Supreme Court
in the San Mateo County case, on December 19, 1882,
Mr. Roscoe Conkling, who had been a member of the
committee which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, unfolded
for the first time the deep purpose of the committee,
and showed from the journal of that committee that
it was not their intention to confine the amendment merely
to the protection of the colored race. In the course of
his argument, Mr. Conkling remarked: "At the time the
Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, as the records of the
two Houses will show, individuals and joint-stock companies
were appealing for congressional and administrative
protection against invidious and discriminating state and
local taxes. One instance was that of an express company,
whose stock was owned largely by citizens of the State of
New York, who came with petitions and bills seeking Acts
of Congress to aid them in resisting what they deemed
oppressive taxation in two states, and oppressive and ruinous
rules of damages applied under state laws. That complaints
of oppression in respect of property and other
rights, made by citizens of Northern States who took up
residence in the South, were rife, in and out of Congress,
none of us can forget; that complaints of oppression in
various forms, of white men in the South, --- of 'Union
men,' --- were heard on every side, I need not remind the
Court. The war and its results, the condition of the freedmen,
and the manifest duty owed to them, no doubt
brought on the occasion for constitutional amendment;
but when the occasion came and men set themselves to the
task, the accumulated evils falling within the purview of
the work were the surrounding circumstances, in the light
of which they strove to increase and strengthen the safeguards
of the Constitution and laws."[^/226]

In spite of important testimony to the effect that those
who drafted the Fourteenth Amendment really intended
"to nationalize liberty," that is, laissez faire, against state
legislatures, the Supreme Court at first refused to accept
this broad interpretation, and it was not until after several
of the judges of the old states'-rights school had been replaced
by judges of the new school that the claims of Mr.
Conkling's group as to the Fourteenth Amendment were
embodied in copious judicial decisions.

... \[No\] layman can easily unravel the mysterious refinements,
distinctions, and logical subtleties by which the
fact was finally established that property was to be free
from all interference except such as might be allowed by
the Supreme Court (or rather five judges of that Court)
appointed by the President and Senate, thus removed as
far as possible from the pressure of public sentiment. Had
a bald veto power of this character been suddenly vested
in any small group of persons, there can be no doubt that
a political revolt would have speedily followed. But the
power was built up by gradual accretions made by the
Court under the stimulus of skillful counsel for private
parties, and finally clothed in the majesty of settled law. It
was a long time before the advocates of leveling democracy,
leading an attack on corporate rights and privileges,
discovered that the courts were the bulwarks of laissez
faire and directed their popular battalions in that direction.


[^/226]: Taylor, Origin and Growth of the American Constitution,
p. 355. As a matter of fact, Conkling, who was a member of
the committee that drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, voted
against these provisions in committee.

Those who undertake to criticize the Supreme Court for
this assumption of power do not always distinguish between
the power itself and the manner of its exercise.
What would have happened if the state legislatures had
been given a free hand to regulate, penalize, and blackmail
corporations at will during the evolution of our national
economic system may be left to the imagination of those
who recall from their history the breezy days of "wild-cat"
currency, repudiation, and broken faith which characterized
the thirty years preceding the Civil War when the
federal judiciary was under the dominance of the states'rights
school. The regulation of a national economic system
by forty or more local legislatures would be nothing
short of an attempt to combine economic unity with local
anarchy. It is possible to hold that the Court has been too
tender of corporate rights in assuming the power of judicial
review, and at the same time recognize the fact that such a
power, vested somewhere in the national government, is
essential to the continuance of industries and commerce on
a national scale. ...

On the side of the masses involved in the transition ...
\[the industrial\] revolution meant an increasing proportion
of wage workers as contrasted with agriculturalists, owning
and operating their farms, and with handicraftsmen. ...

This industrial development meant the transformation
of vast masses of the people into a proletariat, with all the
term implies: an immense population housed in tenements
and rented dwellings, the organization of the class into
trades-unions, labor parties, and other groups; poverty and
degradation on a large scale; strikes, lockouts, and social
warfare; the employment of large numbers of women and
children in factories; the demand for all kinds of legislation
mitigating the evils of the capitalist process; and
finally attacks upon the very basis of the industrial system
itself.

This inevitable concomitant of the mechanical revolution,
the industrial proletariat, began to make itself felt as
a decided political and economic factor in the decade that
followed the war. Between 1860 and 1870, the railway
engineers, firemen, conductors, bricklayers, and cigarmakers
had formed unions. In the campaign of 1872 a
party of Labor Reformers appeared; and a few years later
the Knights of Labor, a grand consolidated union of all
trades and grades of workers, came into existence as an
active force, conducting an agitation for labor bureaus, an
eight-hour day, abolition of contract-labor systems, and
other reforms, and at the same time engineering strikes.

In 1877 occurred the first of the great labor struggles
in that long series of campaigns which have marked the
relations of capitalists and workingmen during the past
four decades. In that year, trouble began between the management
of the Baltimore and Ohio railway and its employees
over a threatened reduction in wages --- the fourth
within a period of seven years. From this starting point
the contest spread throughout the East and Middle West,
reaching as far as Texas. Inasmuch as there was already
considerable unemployment, the strikers saw that only by
violence and intimidation could they hope to prevent the
companies from moving their trains. Troops were called
out by the governors of several states and federal assistance
was invoked. Pittsburgh fell almost completely into the
hands of the strikers; railway buildings were burned and
property to the value of more than ten million dollars
destroyed. Everywhere the raw militia of the states was
found to be inefficient for such a serious purpose, and the
superior power of the federal government's regular troops
was demonstrated. Where railways were in the hands of
receivers, federal courts intervened by the use of injunctions
and the first blood in the contest between the judiciary
and labor was drawn. ...

However, emphasis upon this great industrial revolution
should not be allowed to obscure the no less remarkable
development in agriculture. The acreage in improved farm
lands rose from 113,032,614 in 1850 to 478,451,750 in 1910. In the same period the number of farms increased
from 1,449,073 to 6,361,502. Notwithstanding the significant
fact that "whereas the total population increased 21% between 1900 and 1910, the urban population
increased 34.8% and the rural population 11.2%," the broad basis of the population during the half a
century here under consideration has remained agricultural,
and in 1913 it was estimated that at the present rate
of transformation "it will take a generation before the relative
number of industrial wage workers will have reached
half of all bread winners."...

Notwithstanding the prominence given to the Negro
question during and after Reconstruction, the South had
other problems no less grave in character to meet. Industry
and agriculture were paralyzed by the devastations of the
war. A vast amount of material capital --- railways, wharves,
bridges, and factories --- had been destroyed during the conflict;
and fluid capital seeking investment had been almost
destroyed as well. The rich with ready money at their
command had risked nearly all their store in Confederate
securities or had lost their money loaned in other ways
through the wreck of the currency.

The very necessities of the South served to bind that
section to the North in a new fashion. Fluid capital had to
be secured, in part at least, from the North, and Northern
enterprise found a new outlet in the reconstruction of the
old, and the development of the new, industries in the
region of the former Confederacy. ... This \[interest\]
was, in part, due to the abundance of water power in the
hill regions, the cheap labor of women and children, the
low cost of living, and the absence of labor laws interfering
with the hours and conditions of work in the factories.
...

The social effects which accompany capitalist development
inevitably began to appear in the South. The industrial
magnate began to contest with the old aristocracy
of the soil for supremacy; many former slave owners and
their descendants drifted into manufacturing ... and
energetic Northern businessmen were to be found in
Southern market places vying with their no less enterprising
Southern brethren. The men concerned in creating
this new nexus of interest between the two regions naturally
deprecated the perpetual agitation of sectional issues
by the politicians, and particularly Northern interference
in the Negro question. Business interest began to pour cold
water on the hottest embers which the Civil War had left
behind.
