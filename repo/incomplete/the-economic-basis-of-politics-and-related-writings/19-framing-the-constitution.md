## Framing the Constitution[^/1491]

As blackstone[^/1492] shows by happy illustration the reason
and spirit of a law are to be understood only by an inquiry
into the circumstances of its enactment. The underlying
purposes of the Constitution \[of the United States\], therefore,
are to be revealed only by a study of the conditions
and events which led to its formation and adoption.

At the outset it must be remembered that there were two
great parties at the time of the adoption of the Constitution
--- one laying emphasis on strength and efficiency in
government and the other on its popular aspects. Quite
naturally the men who led in stirring up the revolt against
Great Britain and in keeping the fighting temper of the
Revolutionists at the proper heat were the boldest and most
radical thinkers --- men like Samuel Adams, Thomas Paine,
Patrick Henry, and Thomas Jefferson. They were not,
generally speaking, men of large property interests or of
much practical business experience. In a time of disorder,
they could consistently lay more stress upon personal liberty
than upon social control; and they pushed to the
extreme limits those doctrines of individual rights which
had been evolved in England during the struggles of the
small landed proprietors and commercial classes against
royal prerogative, and which corresponded to the economic
conditions prevailing in America at the close of the eighteenth
century. They associated strong government with
monarchy, and came to believe that the best political system
was one which governed least. A majority of the
radicals viewed all government, especially if highly centralized,
as a species of evil, tolerable only because necessary
and always to be kept down to an irreducible minimum
by a jealous vigilance.

Jefferson put the doctrine in concrete form when he
declared that he preferred newspapers without government
to government without newspapers. The Declaration of
Independence, the first state Constitutions, and the Articles
of Confederation bore the impress of this philosophy. In
their anxiety to defend the individual against all federal
interference and to preserve to the states a large sphere of
local autonomy, these Revolutionists had set up a system
too weak to accomplish the accepted objects of government;
namely, national defense, the protection of property,
and the advancement of commerce. They were not unaware
of the character of their handiwork, but they believed
with Jefferson that "man was a rational animal endowed
by nature with rights and with an innate sense of
justice and that he could be restrained from wrong and
protected in right by moderate powers confided to persons
of his own choice." Occasional riots and disorders, they
held, were preferable to too much government.

The new American political system based on these doctrines
had scarcely gone into effect before it began to
incur opposition from many sources. The close of the
Revolutionary struggle removed the prime cause for radical
agitation and brought a new group of thinkers into prominence.
When independence had been gained, the practical
work to be done was the maintenance of social order, the
payment of the public debt, the provision of a sound
financial system, and the establishment of conditions favorable
to the development of the economic resources of the
new country. The men who were principally concerned in
this work of peaceful enterprise were not the philosophers,
but men of business and property and the holders of public
securities. For the most part they had had no quarrel with
the system of class rule and the strong centralization of
government which existed in England. It was on the question
of policy, not of governmental structure, that they had
broken with the British authorities. By no means all of
them, in fact, had even resisted the policy of the mother
country, for within the ranks of the conservatives were
large numbers of Loyalists who had remained in America,
and, as was to have been expected, cherished a bitter feeling
against the Revolutionists, especially the radical section
which had been boldest in denouncing the English system
root and branch. In other words, after the heat and excitement
of the War of Independence were over and the
new government, state and national, was tested by the
ordinary experiences of traders, financiers, and manufacturers,
it was found inadequate, and these groups accordingly
grew more and more determined to reconstruct the
political system in such a fashion as to make it subserve
their permanent interests.

Under the state constitutions and the Articles of Confederation
established during the Revolution, every powerful
economic class in the nation suffered either immediate
losses or from impediments placed in the way of the
development of their enterprises. The holders of the securities
of the Confederate government did not receive the
interest on their loans. Those who owned Western lands or
looked with longing eyes upon the rich opportunities for
speculation there chaffed at the weakness of the government
and its delays in establishing order on the frontiers.
Traders and commercial men found their plans for commerce
on a national scale impeded by local interference
with interstate commerce. The currency of the states and
the nation was hopelessly muddled. Creditors everywhere
were angry about the depreciated paper money which the
agrarians had made and were attempting to force upon
those from whom they had borrowed specie. In short, it
was a war between business and populism. Under the
Articles of Confederation populism had a free hand, for
majorities in the state legislatures were omnipotent. Anyone
who reads the economic history of the time will see
why the solid conservative interests of the country were
weary of talk about the "rights of the people" and bent
upon establishing firm guarantees for the rights of property.

The Congress of the Confederation was not long in discovering
the true character of the futile authority which
the Articles had conferred upon it. The necessity for new
sources of revenue became apparent even while the struggle
for independence was yet undecided, and, in 1781, Congress
carried a resolution to the effect that it should be
authorized to lay a duty of five % on certain goods.
This moderate proposition was defeated because Rhode
Island rejected it on the grounds that "she regarded it the
most precious jewel of sovereignty that no state shall be
called upon to open its purse but by the authority of the
state and by her own officers." Two years later Congress
prepared another amendment to the Articles providing for
certain import duties, the receipts from which, collected by
state officers, were to be applied to the payment of the
public debt; but three years after the introduction of the
measure, four states, including New York, still held out
against its ratification, and the project was allowed to drop.
At last, in 1786, Congress in a resolution declared that the
requisitions for the last eight years had been so irregular
in their operation, so uncertain in their collection, and so
evidently unproductive, that a reliance on them in the
future would be no less dishonorable to the understandings
of those who entertained it than it would be dangerous to
the welfare and peace of the Union. Congress, thereupon,
solemnly added that it had become its duty "to declare
most explicitly that the crisis had arrived when the people
of the United States, by whose will and for whose benefit
the federal government was instituted, must decide whether
they will support their rank as a nation by maintaining the
public faith at home and abroad, or whether for the want
of a timely exertion in establishing a general revenue and
thereby giving strength to the Confederacy, they will hazard
not only the existence of the Union but those great and
invaluable privileges for which they have so arduously and
so honorably contended."

In fact, the Articles of Confederation had hardly gone
into effect before the leading citizens also began to feel that
the powers of Congress were wholly inadequate. In 1780,
even before their adoption, Alexander Hamilton proposed
a general convention to frame a new constitution, and from
that time forward he labored with remarkable zeal and
wisdom to extend and popularize the idea of a strong national
government. Two years later, the Assembly of the
State of New York recommended a convention to revise
the Articles and increase the power of Congress. In 1783,
Washington, in a circular letter to the governors, urged
that it was indispensable to the happiness of the individual
states that there should be lodged somewhere a supreme
power to regulate and govern the general concerns of the
confederation. Shortly afterward (1785), Governor Bowdoin,
of Massachusetts, suggested to his state legislature
the advisability of calling a national assembly to settle upon
and define the powers of Congress; and the legislature resolved
that the government under the Articles of Confederation
was inadequate and should be reformed; but the
resolution was never laid before Congress.

In January, 1786, Virginia invited all the other states to
send delegates to a convention at Annapolis to consider the
question of duties on imports and commerce in general.
When this convention assembled in 1786, delegates from
only five states were present, and they were disheartened
at the limitations on their powers and the lack of interest
the other states had shown in the project. With characteristic
foresight, however, Alexander Hamilton seized the
occasion to secure the adoption of a recommendation advising
the states to choose representatives for another convention
to meet in Philadelphia the following year "to consider
the Articles of Confederation and to propose such
changes therein as might render them adequate to the
exigencies of the union." This recommendation was cautiously
worded, for Hamilton did not want to raise any
unnecessary alarm. He doubtless believed that a complete
revolution in the old system was desirable, but he knew
that, in the existing state of popular temper, it was not
expedient to announce his complete program. Accordingly
no general reconstruction of the political system was suggested;
the Articles of Confederation were merely to be
"revised"; and the amendments were to be approved by
the state legislatures as provided by that instrument.

The proposal of the Annapolis convention was transmitted
to the state legislatures and laid before Congress.
Congress thereupon resolved in February, 1787, that a
convention should be held for the sole and express purpose
of revising the Articles of Confederation and reporting to
itself and the legislatures of the several states such alterations
and provisions as would when agreed to by Congress
and confirmed by the states render the federal constitution
adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation
of the union.

In pursuance of this call, delegates to the new convention
were chosen by the legislatures of the states or by the
governors in conformity to authority conferred by the
legislative assemblies.[^/154] The delegates were given instructions
of a general nature by their respective states, none of
which, apparently, contemplated any very far-reaching
changes. In fact, almost all of them expressly limited their
representatives to a mere revision of the Articles of Confederation.
For example, Connecticut authorized her delegates
to represent and confer for the purpose mentioned
in the resolution of Congress and to discuss such measures
"agreeably to the general principles of Republican government"
as they should think proper to render the Union
adequate. Delaware, however, went so far as to provide
that none of the proposed alterations should extend to the
fifth part of the Articles of Confederation guaranteeing
that each state should be entitled to one vote.

It was a truly remarkable assembly of men that gathered
in Philadelphia on May 14, 1787, to undertake the work of
reconstructing the American system of government. It is
not merely patriotic pride that compels one to assert that
never in the history of assemblies has there been a convention
of men richer in political experience and in practical
knowledge, or endowed with a profounder insight into the
springs of human action and the intimate essence of government.
It is indeed an astounding fact that at one time
so many men skilled in statecraft could be found on the
very frontiers of civilization among a population numbering
about four million whites. It is no less a cause for
admiration that their instrument of government should
have survived the trials and crises of a century that saw
the wreck of more than a score of paper constitutions.

All the members had had a practical training in politics.
Washington, as commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary
forces, had learned well the lessons and problems of war,
and mastered successfully the no less difficult problems of
administration. The two Morrises had distinguished themselves
in grappling with financial questions as trying and
perplexing as any which statesmen had ever been compelled
to face. Seven of the delegates had gained political
wisdom as governors of their native states; and no less than
twenty-eight had served in Congress either during the
Revolution or under the Articles of Confederation. These
were men trained in the law, versed in finance, skilled in
administration, and learned in the political philosophy of
their own and all earlier times. Moreover, they were men
destined to continue public service under the government
which they had met to construct --- Presidents, Vice-Presidents,
heads of departments, Justices of the Supreme Court
were in that imposing body. ...


[^/154]: Rhode Island alone was unrepresented. In all, sixty-two
delegates were appointed by the states; fifty-five of these attended
sometime during the sessions; but only thirty-nine
signed the finished document.

As Woodrow Wilson has concisely put it, the framers of
the Constitution represented "a strong and intelligent class
possessed of unity and informed by a conscious solidarity
of interests."[^/1551] ...

The makers of the federal Constitution represented the
solid, conservative, commercial and financial interests of
the country --- not the interests which denounced and proscribed
judges in Rhode Island, New Jersey, and North
Carolina, and stoned their houses in New York. The conservative
interests, made desperate by the imbecilities of
the Confederation and harried by state legislatures, roused
themselves from their lethargy, drew together in a mighty
effort to establish a government that would be strong
enough to pay the national debt, regulate interstate and
foreign commerce, provide for national defense, prevent
fluctuations in the currency created by paper emissions,
and control the propensities of legislative majorities
to attack private rights. The radicals, however, like
Patrick Henry, Jefferson, and Samuel Adams, were conspicuous
by their absence from the convention.[^/1552] ...

\[The makers of the Constitution were convened\] to frame
a government which would meet the practical issues that
had arisen under the Articles of Confederation. The objections
they entertained to direct popular government, and
they were undoubtedly many, were based upon their experience
with popular assemblies during the immediately
preceding years. With many of the plain lessons of history
before them, they naturally feared that the rights and
privileges of the minority would be insecure if the principle
of majority rule was definitely adopted and provisions
made for its exercise. Furthermore, it will be remembered
that up to that time the right of all men, as men, to share
in the government had never been recognized in practice.
Everywhere in Europe the government was in the hands of
a ruling monarch or at best a ruling class; everywhere the
mass of the people had been regarded principally as an
arms-bearing and tax-paying multitude, uneducated, and
with little hope or capacity for advancement. Two years
were to elapse after the meeting of the grave assembly at
Philadelphia before the transformation of the Estates General
into the National Convention in France opened the
floodgates of revolutionary ideas on human rights before
whose rising tide old landmarks of government are still
being submerged. It is small wonder, therefore, that, under
the circumstances, many of the members of that august
body held popular government in slight esteem and took
the people into consideration only as far as it was imperative
"to inspire them with the necessary confidence," as
Mr. Gerry frankly put it.[^/1561]

Indeed, every page of the laconic record of the proceedings
of the convention preserved to posterity by Mr. Madison
shows conclusively that the members of that assembly
were not seeking to realize any fine notions about democracy
and equality, but were striving with all the resources
of political wisdom at their command to set up a system
of government that would be stable and efficient, safeguarded
on one hand against the possibilities of despotism
and on the other against the onslaught of majorities. In
the mind of Mr. Gerry, the evils they had experienced
flowed "from the excess of democracy," and he confessed
that while he was still republican, he "had been taught by
experience the danger of the levelling spirit."[^/1562] Mr. Randolph
in offering to the consideration of the convention
his plan of government, observed "that the general object
was to provide a cure for the evils under which the United
States labored; that, in tracing these evils to their origin,
every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of
democracy; that some check therefore was to be sought for
against this tendency of our governments; and that a good
Senate seemed most likely to answer the purpose."[^/1571] Mr.
Hamilton, in advocating a life term for Senators, urged
that "all communities divide themselves into the few and
the many. The first are rich and well born and the other
the mass of the people who seldom judge or determine
right."

Gouverneur Morris wanted to check the "precipitancy,
changeableness, and excess" of the representatives of the
people by the ability and virtue of men "of great and
established property --- aristocracy; men who from pride will
support consistency and permanency ... Such an aristocratic
body will keep down the turbulence of democracy."
While these extreme doctrines were somewhat counterbalanced
by the democratic principles of Mr. Wilson
who urged that "the government ought to possess, not only
first, the force, but second the mind or sense of the people
at large," Madison doubtless summed up in a brief sentence
the general opinion of the convention when he said that to
secure private rights against majority factions, and at the
same time to preserve the spirit and form of popular government,
was the great object to which their inquiries had
been directed.[^/1572]

They were anxious above everything else to safeguard
the rights of private property against any leveling tendencies
on the part of the propertyless masses. Gouverneur
Morris, in speaking on the problem of apportioning representatives,
correctly stated the sound historical fact when
he declared: "Life and liberty were generally said to be of
more value than property. An accurate view of the matter
would, nevertheless, prove that property was the main
object of society. ... If property, then, was the main
object of government, certainly it ought to be one measure
of the influence due to those who were to be affected by
the government."[^/1581] Mr. King also agreed that "property
was the primary object of society";[^/1582] and Mr. Madison
warned the convention that in framing a system which they
wished to last for ages they must not lose sight of the
changes which the ages would produce in the forms and
distribution of property. In advocating a long term in
order to give independence and firmness to the Senate, he
described these impending changes: "An increase of population
will of necessity increase the proportion of those
who will labor under all the hardships of life and secretly
sigh for a more equal distribution of its blessings. These
may in time outnumber those who are placed above the
feelings of indigence. According to the equal laws of suffrage,
the power will slide into the hands of the former.
No agrarian attempts have yet been made in this country,
but symptoms of a levelling spirit, as we have understood
have sufficiently appeared, in a certain quarter, to give
notice of the future danger."[^/1583] And again, in support of
the argument for a property qualification on voters, Madison
urged: "In future times, a great majority of the people
will not only be without landed, but any other sort of property.
These will either combine, under the influence of
their common situation, --- in which case the rights of property
and the public liberty will not be secure in their hands,
--- or, what is more probable, they will become the tools
of opulence and ambition; in which case there will be equal
danger on another side."[^/1584] Various projects for setting up
class rule by the establishment of property qualifications
for voters and officers were advanced in the convention,
but they were defeated. ...

The absence of such property qualifications is certainly
not due to any belief in Jefferson's free-and-equal doctrine.
It is due rather to the fact that the members of the convention
could not agree on the nature and amount of the
qualifications. Naturally a landed qualification was suggested,
but for obvious reasons it was rejected. Although
it was satisfactory to the landed gentry of the South, it
did not suit the financial, commercial, and manufacturing
gentry of the North. If it was high, the latter would be
excluded; if it was low it would let in the populistic farmers
who had already made so much trouble in the state
legislatures with paper-money schemes and other devices
for "relieving agriculture." One of the chief reasons for
calling the convention and framing the Constitution was
to promote commerce and industry and to protect personal
property against the "depredations" of Jefferson's noble
freeholders. On the other hand a personal-property qualification,
high enough to please merchant princes like
Robert Morris and Nathaniel Gorham would shut out the
Southern planters. Again, an alternative of land or personal
property, high enough to afford safeguards to large
interests, would doubtless bring about the rejection of the
whole Constitution by the trouble-making farmers who
had to pass upon the question of ratification.[^/1591] ...

Nevertheless, by the system of checks and balances
placed in the government, the convention safeguarded the
interests of property against attacks by majorities. The
House of Representatives, Mr. Hamilton pointed out, "was
so formed as to render it particularly the guardian of the
poorer orders of citizens,"[^/1592] while the Senate was to preserve
the rights of property and the interests of the
minority against the demands of the majority.[^/1593] In the
tenth number of The Federalist, Mr. Madison argued in a
philosophic vein in support of the proposition that it was
necessary to base the political system on the actual conditions
of "natural inequality." Uniformity of interests
throughout the state, he contended, was impossible on account
of the diversity in the faculties of men, from which
the rights of property originated; the protection of these
faculties was the first object of government; from the protection
of different and unequal faculties of acquiring
property the possession of different degrees and kinds of
property immediately resulted; from the influence of these
on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors
ensued a division of society into different interests and
parties; the unequal distribution of wealth inevitably led
to a clash of interests in which the majority was liable
to carry out its policies at the expense of the minority;
hence, he added, in concluding this splendid piece of logic,
"the majority, having such coexistent passion or interest,
must be rendered by their number and local situation unable
to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression";
and in his opinion it was the great merit of the
newly framed Constitution that it secured the rights of the
minority against "the superior force of an interested and
overbearing majority."

This very system of checks and balances, which is undeniably
the essential element of the Constitution, is built
upon the doctrine that the popular branch of the government
cannot be allowed full sway, and least of all in the
enactment of laws touching the rights of property. The
exclusion of the direct popular vote in the election of the
President; the creation, again by indirect election, of a
Senate which the framers hoped would represent the
wealth and conservative interests of the country;[^/160] and the
establishment of an independent judiciary appointed by
the President with the concurrence of the Senate --- all
these devices bear witness to the fact that the underlying
purpose of the Constitution was not the establishment
of popular government by means of parliamentary majorities.

Page after page of The Federalist is directed to that
portion of the electorate which was disgusted with the
"mutability of the public councils." Writing on the Presidential
veto Hamilton says: "The propensity of the legislative
department to intrude upon the rights, and absorb
the powers, of the other departments has already been
suggested and repeated ... It may perhaps be said that
the power of preventing bad laws included the power of
preventing good ones; and may be used to the one purpose
as well as the other. But this objection will have little
weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs
of that inconstancy and mutability in the laws which form
the greatest blemish in the character and genius of our
governments. They will consider every institution calculated
to restrain the excess of law-making and to keep
things in the same state in which they happen to be at
any given period, as more likely to do good than harm;
because it is favorable to greater stability in the system
of legislation. The injury which may be possibly done by
defeating a few good laws will be amply compensated by
the advantage of preventing a number of bad ones."


[^/160]: Compiler's note: Popular election of Senators was
achieved in 1913 through the XVIIth Amendment to the Constitution.

When the framers of the Constitution had completed the
remarkable instrument which was to establish a national
government capable of discharging effectively certain great
functions and checking the propensities of popular legislatures
to attack the rights of private property, a formidable
task remained before them --- the task of securing the
adoption of the new frame of government by states torn
with popular dissensions. They knew very well that the
state legislatures which had been so negligent in paying
their quotas \[of money\] under the Articles \[of Confederation\]
and which had been so jealous of their rights, would
probably stick at ratifying such a national instrument of
government. Accordingly they cast aside that clause in the
Articles requiring amendments to be ratified by the legislatures
of all the states; and advised that the new Constitution
should be ratified by conventions in the several
states composed of delegates chosen by the voters.[^/161] They
furthermore declared --- and this is a fundamental matter ---
that when the conventions of nine states had ratified the
Constitution the new government should go into effect so
far as those states were concerned. The chief reason for
resorting to ratifications by conventions is laid down by
Hamilton in the twenty-second number of The Federalist:
"It has not a little contributed to the infirmities of the
existing federal system that it never had a ratification by
the people. Resting on no better foundation than the consent
of the several legislatures, it has been exposed to
frequent and intricate questions concerning the validity of
its powers; and has in some instances given birth to the
enormous doctrine of a right of legislative repeal. Owing
its ratification to the law of a state, it has been contended
that the same authority might repeal the law by which it
was ratified. However gross a heresy it may be to maintain
that a party to a compact has a right to revoke that compact,
the doctrine itself has respectable advocates. The
possibility of a question of this nature proves the necessity
of laying the foundations of our national government
deeper than in the mere sanction of delegated authority.
The fabric of American empire ought to rest on the solid
basis of the consent of the people. The streams of national
power ought to flow immediately from that pure
original fountain of all legitimate authority."


[^/161]: Compiler's note: The original text, p. 75, comments: "It
was largely because the framers of the Constitution knew the
temper and class bias of the state legislatures that they arranged
that the new Constitution should be ratified by conventions."

Of course, the convention did not resort to the revolutionary
policy of transmitting the Constitution directly to
the conventions of the several states. It merely laid the
finished instrument before the Confederate Congress with
the suggestion that it should be submitted to "a convention
of delegates chosen in each state by the people thereof,
under the recommendation of its legislature, for their
assent and ratification; and each convention assenting
thereto and ratifying the same should give notice thereof
to the United States in Congress assembled." The convention
went on to suggest that when nine states had ratified
the Constitution, the Confederate Congress should extinguish
itself by making provision for the elections necessary
to put the new government into effect. ...

After the new Constitution was published and transmitted
to the states, there began a long and bitter fight
over ratification. A veritable flood of pamphlet literature
descended upon the country, and a collection of these
pamphlets by Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, brought together
under the title of The Federalist --- though clearly a
piece of campaign literature --- has remained a permanent
part of the contemporary sources on the Constitution and
has been regarded by many lawyers as a commentary
second in value only to the decisions of the Supreme
Court. Within a year the champions of the new government
found themselves victorious, for on June 21, 1788,
the ninth state, New Hampshire, ratified the Constitution,
and accordingly the new government might go into effect
as between the agreeing states. Within a few weeks, the
nationalist party in Virginia and New York succeeded in
winning these two states, and in spite of the fact that
North Carolina and Rhode Island had not yet ratified the
Constitution, Congress determined to put the instrument
into effect in accordance with the recommendations of the
convention. Elections for the new government were held;
the date March 4, 1789, was fixed for the formal establishment
of the new system; Congress secured a quorum on
April 6; and on April 30 Washington was inaugurated at
the Federal Hall in Wall Street, New York.
