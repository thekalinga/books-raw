## Democratic-Republican Alignment[^/210]

WHILE THE DEMOCRATS were refusing to support industrial
enterprise, vital economic forces were preparing the way
for an intensification of the battle between agriculture and
capitalism. ...

### Shifts in the Economic Setting

In the Northeast, manufacturing and railways were rapidly
expanding, employing more labor and increasing the
number and wealth of businessmen. By 1850, the value of
the property employed in mills, mines, railways, and urban
undertakings generally exceeded the value of all the farms
and plantations between the Atlantic and the Pacific. A
fact immense and ominous, as Carlyle would say.

In the South, cotton planting, stimulated by the development
of the cotton gin and textile machinery, became the
dominant interest, as against tobacco, rice, and sugar; by
1860 nearly two-thirds of the slaves were engaged in cultivating
that crop. Cotton raising rapidly exhausted the soil
and led the planters to push steadily westward, occupying
new land.

In the Northwest, farmers were pressing across the
Mississippi, demanding the opening of more territories to
the plow and the granting of free homesteads to all who
cared to ask for them. There was also a rapid growth in
industrial cities like Cincinnati and Chicago and in the
construction of railways uniting the Mississippi Valley with
the Atlantic ports of Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.
Once the stronghold of Jacksonian Democracy, the Northwest
was now being assimilated to the economic system of
the Northeast --- severed from its affiliation with the Southern
planters.

### The Slavery Issue

Into the issues inherited from Hamilton's day --- the tariff,
\[banking\], internal improvements, sound currency, and subsidies
for business enterprise --- was now injected a new
issue, slavery. ... Had the abolition question stood alone
and had the slave owners been content with maintaining
slavery in the states where it was lawful, the controversy
over the subject might never have taken a serious turn.

It so happened, however, that slavery could not be
isolated. It was a labor system, the basis of planting, the
foundation of the Southern aristocracy. And that aristocracy,
being agricultural in interest, generally opposed high
protective tariffs, ship subsidies, internal improvements,
and other measures deemed advantageous to business enterprise.

Moreover, that aristocracy, eager to protect itself against
adverse legislation at Washington, was constantly afraid of
being outvoted in Congress. Especially did it object to the
exclusion of slavery from the territories because that policy
meant the erection of new free states to "overbalance"
the Southern states.

Declaring that the Western territories had all been won
by common sacrifices, Southern planters never ceased to
regard it an act of justice to open the West to slavery.
Although they accepted the Missouri Compromise of 1820,
excluding slavery from the northern portion of the Louisiana
territory, and the compromise of 1850, their most
ardent leaders refused to abide by the settlement as final.

At last, in 1854, they came out boldly with their demand.
Under the leadership of Stephen A. Douglas, supported
by an almost solid delegation from the South, Congress, in
that year, passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act which expressly
repealed the Missouri Compromise and provided that two
Western territories then erected, Kansas and Nebraska,
could come into the Union as states with or without
slavery, as their constitutions might stipulate.

### Rise of the Third Republican Party

On the very morning after the House of Representatives
took up the Kansas-Nebraska bill, several members of that
body held a conference and agreed that the "slave power"
could only be checked by the formation of a party directly
opposed to its plans for expansion. About the same time a
mass meeting was held at Ripon, Wisconsin, and a resolution
adopted to the effect that a new organization, to be
called Republican, should be formed on the question of
slavery extension, if the bill passed.

Indeed, all through the North and East, there were signs
of dissolution among the Democrats and Whigs, and a
general realignment; in the spring and summer of 1854,
meetings were held in Illinois, Maine, Vermont, Michigan,
Iowa, Indiana, Massachusetts, and New York, at which the
Kansas-Nebraska bill was roundly denounced. On July 6,
1854, a state convention was held at Jackson, Michigan, at
which a full state ticket of Republican candidates was
nominated.

Thus launched, a third Republican party --- bearing the
vote-getting title which Jefferson had given to his hosts in
1800 and Clay's party had taken in 1831--- held its first
national convention at Philadelphia in June, 1856, on a
call issued by a preliminary meeting assembled at. Pittsburgh,
in the preceding February. At this convention, John
Charles Frémont was nominated as the candidate on a
platform which declared that it was the right and duty of
Congress to prohibit slavery in the territories. In the
campaign which ensued, Frémont won 1,341,264 votes
against 2,712,703 votes cast in favor of the Democratic
and the Whig candidates.

During the four years which followed, the Republican
party gained in strength. It gathered recruits among Northern
farmers and mechanics, who believed that the federal
lands should be given away in homesteads to poor men. It
added to its farmer and mechanic regiments, manufacturers
of the East who objected strenuously to the reduction of
the protective tariff by the Democrats in 1857, and demanded
an increase in the rates.

Responding to the requirements of these powerful
groups, the Republicans, at their convention in Chicago in
1860, favored a homestead law and a protective tariff, as
well as the exclusion of slavery from the territories. Thus
they appealed to many farmers and mechanics who had
formerly voted the Democratic ticket and at the same time
made a bid for support among the Whig manufacturers
who clung to the doctrines of Alexander Hamilton. By
selecting as their candidate Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois,
they made a shrewd and fateful stroke.

Fortunately for the Republicans, the Democrats now
split into two factions, one headed by Stephen A. Douglas,
who hoped to solve the slavery question by allowing the
people of each territory, on admission to the Union as a
state, to decide it for themselves; the other by John C.
Breckinridge, who held to the extreme Southern view that
Congress had no power to prevent slavery in the territories.
By another faction, composed of conservative Whigs and
Democrats, known as Constitutional Unionists, John Bell
was nominated on a platform that begged the slavery issue.
Owing to the division among their opponents, the Republicans
were able to win the Presidency, although their popular
vote was only 1,866,452 as against 2,815,617 cast for
their opponents.

### A Federalist Program under Republican Auspices

During the Civil War and Reconstruction, the Republicans
repudiated the policies which the Democrats had
laboriously supported between 1830 and 1860, and substituted
other policies more in accord with the historic
principles of the Federalists and the Whigs, thus illustrating
again the essential continuity of the American political
battle. ...

1. National debt. The Federalists had funded and defended a great national debt, drawing the creditors to the
   support of the federal government. In 1865, the Republicans had a war debt more than twenty times the size of
   Hamilton's accumulation, and all holders of federal bonds
   looked to the Republican party for the strict payment of
   interest and principal. The old Jefferson-Jackson idea of a
   debtless government seemed far removed again.
2. Protective tariff. After many years of debate and
   agitation, the Democrats, by 1857, had pushed the tariff
   far down the scale in the direction of free trade. During
   their tenure of power from 1861 to 1865, the Republicans
   more than realized the Hamiltonian ideal by raising the
   duties again and again, to the highest peak of protection
   yet reached in the history of the country.
3. Banking system. With respect to no issue had the
   Democrats been more consistent than in dealing with the
   United States Bank. Jeffersonian Republicans had been
   against it and had only yielded to a demand for its restoration in 1816 under the necessities of war finance. In Jackson's administration, the Bank was completely demolished
   and the most heroic efforts of the Whigs could not revive
   it. But in 1863--- once more in time of war distress --- the
   third Republican party managed to create another national
   banking system, drawing to the support of the government
   a powerful economic interest.
4. Currency. When the Civil War broke out, the country
   was flooded with paper money issued by local banks
   chartered by the states. There were hundreds of varieties of
   all denominations, some sound, but much of it depreciated
   and fluctuating.

This was ... disturbing to business and pleased only
debtors and farmers. Returning to Hamiltonian principles
in 1865, the Republicans abolished this state currency by
taxing it out of existence. Unfortunately, however, for the
cause of sound money, they had to issue huge quantities
of paper themselves to finance the war; but a few years
later they put it all on a specie basis.

5. The commercial empire. The extension of trading operations, particularly in the Pacific and the Far East, which
   the Federalists had favored with special legislation and the
   Whigs had promoted by vigorous executive action through
   the Navy and State Departments, was not overlooked even
   during the dark days of the Civil War.[^/214]

William H. Seward, whom Lincoln selected as head of
the State Department, was the most outspoken imperialist
in the country. During the campaign of 1860 he had proclaimed
the future of the American empire. Canada was to
be annexed, our southern borders were to be pushed down
to include Latin-American republics, the Pacific was announced
as the theater of the coming centuries, and a
conflict between the United States and Russia on the plains
of China was prophesied as a fruit of destiny. Such was
the creed of the master in charge of foreign affairs from
1861 until 1869.


[^/214]: _See above_, pp. 191--2.

Fantastic as most of Seward's doctrines may have appeared
in 1860, they were not all mere rhetoric. Some of
them took practical form within a few years. When the
Pacific railway was authorized in the very midst of the
civil conflict, its value to merchants engaged in Far Eastern
trade, as well as its importance to the Union, was recognized
by the initiated. In 1867, Seward purchased Alaska
from Russia, carrying the frontier of the United States
near to the Asiatic shore. About the same time, through
the good offices of the Navy Department, Seward arranged
for the acquisition of a naval base in Santo Domingo, for
the purchase of the Virgin Islands, and for American control
over the Isthmus of Panama. In these three undertakings
he was defeated by opposition in Congress where such
designs were not yet fully understood.

But his schemes were not forgotten. In 1869, President
Grant arranged for the annexation of Santo Domingo, only
to be baffled by Congress; to the end of his administration
Grant favored the project on the ground, as he said himself,
that "the soil would soon have fallen into the hands
of United States capitalists." In 1872, an American naval
officer secured a coaling station from a local prince in
Samoa, far away in the South Seas. In 1875, a treaty with
the ruler of Hawaii bound him not to alienate any of his
territory except to the United States and a few years later
a supplementary treaty gave the United States exclusive
use of Pearl Harbor. Thus it could be said that the managers
in the party of Hamilton, Webster, and Seward were
consistent in their solicitude for commercial and naval
empire and prepared the way for the administration of
William McKinley, which finally let mankind know, what
was already a fact, that America was a world power.

6. Judicial supremacy. From its Jeffersonian forerunner,
   the Democratic party, with its theory of majority rule,
   had inherited a tradition of criticism with respect to the
   federal judiciary. In the middle period, however, after all
   the old Federalist judges had died or resigned and good
   Democrats had been appointed to the bench, the tradition
   faded. When the Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott case
   (1857) upheld slavery in the territories, Democrats demanded unqualified loyalty and obedience to the decisions
   of that great tribunal. It was the new Republican party,
   whose anti-slavery plank had been splintered by the decision, that now criticized the Court and talked about "reconstructing" it. But once more time and politics worked
   a reorganization of the Court and Republicans conveniently
   forgot their former resolutions of protest against its actions.

They even effected a revision of the Constitution which
gave the federal judiciary a power over the states far
greater than it had ever enjoyed. ... In due time hundreds
of state laws interfering with capitalistic undertakings
were declared null and void by the judiciary acting under
the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment.[^/216]
7. Free land for farmers and mechanics. While the Republicans were effecting these important economic reforms,
   they fulfilled a promise made to farmers and mechanics in
   their platform of 1860. By the Homestead Act of 1862,
   they offered a farm of 160 acres from the national domain,
   free of all charges except petty fees, to citizens and aliens
   who had declared their intention of becoming citizens.
   Applicants merely had to comply with certain conditions in
   order to secure full ownership. Thus hundreds of thousands of farmers in the West were indebted to the Republican party for the very soil they tilled, and nothing short of
   a crisis could make them forget their obligation.

This union of businessmen and free farmers could function
rather smoothly now that the Democratic planters
were ruined by the Civil War. Defeated on the field of
battle, deprived of their slaves by abolition, and for a long
time governed under military authority from Washington,
the planters could not recover their former position of
power in the Democratic party. Even after the wounds of
the War were healed, this important agricultural group,
once the bulwark of the landed interest, did not regain its
old place of continuous dominance in politics. Giant industry,
marching in seven-league boots, outstripped it in
the race.

### Years of Republican Supremacy

From the period of Civil War and Reconstruction the
Republicans emerged as a powerful, consolidated party
fortified by an intense patriotism, by the support of the
manufacturing interests which had flourished under the
war tariffs, by the patronage of capitalists eager to swing
forward with the development of railways and new enterprises,
and by farmers grateful for many favors, including
homesteads. In possession of all the important offices, controlling
the federal legislature, executive, and judiciary,
with the Democratic party prostrate and branded with
treason, the Republicans had a dominion over the destinies
of the country greater than the Democrats had ever
wielded.

Wherever there is such tremendous power, vigilant selfseekers
of every kind are sure to congregate. During the
years which followed the war, the ranks of the Republican
party were permeated with mercenaries of every type ---
spoilsmen hunting offices, railway promoters seeking land
grants and financial aid from the government, manufacturers
demanding more discrimination in the tariff legislation,
and the great army of hangers-on who attached themselves
to these leaders. The integrity of the party was further
injured by the "carpet-baggers" in the South, who, in
the name of the federal government and the Republican
party, plundered the Southern states and heaped upon them
an enormous burden of debt.

In these circumstances, the Democratic party began to
revive. It had had a long and triumphant history previous
to the Civil War; it had great traditions, and numbered on
its roll some of the most distinguished men in American
history. The population of the country was still principally
agricultural and the cotton planters were soon producing as
many bales a year as in the "flush times" before the Civil
War.

It is not surprising, therefore, that the Democratic party
sought to close up its shattered ranks in opposition to Republican
rule. In the South, the whites recovered their
predominance; in the North and West, farmers protested
against the high protective tariffs; here and there throughout
the Union discontent with the railway and corporation
policy of the Republican party began to appear; and the
spoils system which had flourished since Jackson's day
stirred to action a small but vigorous minority of "civil
service reformers."

As a result, the Democratic party, in 1884, was able to
bring together an effective opposition and to elect Grover
Cleveland President, with the support of the "mugwumps"
who bolted the Republicans after the nomination of James
G. Blaine at their Chicago convention. This Democratic
triumph was short-lived, however, for four years later,
when Cleveland raised the tariff issue by his celebrated
message of 1887, the Republicans were able to elect Benjamin
Harrison by a slight majority. Taking advantage of
their victory, they forced through the McKinley tariff
bill, though it was regarded by many members of the
party as entirely too drastic. In the succeeding election of
1892, Cleveland was again able to lead his party to success,
but it could scarcely be said that any vital issues now
divided the two contending parties.
