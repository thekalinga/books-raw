## Political and Military Domination over "the Economic Man" in Our Own Age"[^/99]

During the past quarter of a century radical changes have
occurred in ... the functions of government, particularly
in those which call for wholesale intervention in economic
operations. No doubt the nature and course of economy
had been more or less shaped and directed by the state
from early times. This was especially true under the mercantilist
r√©gimes of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
But in many Western countries during the nineteenth
century economic interests enjoyed a high degree of
freedom and independence as against the state. In these
countries and amid such circumstances it was relatively
easy for persons who held property to wield political power.
In recent years, however, state intervention in economy has
assumed systematic form almost everywhere and the number
of persons employed by the state in giving effect to this
intervention has greatly multiplied. As a result "the political
man" has been gaining in independence from, and in
power over, "the economic man" and is now often in a
position to order him about rather than to take dictation
from him. ...

\[For example, in the United States, by\][^/100] general agreement
it had been early recognized that the great manufacturing
and financial interests in the country were, in the
main, on the Republican side of the political alignment.
There were exceptions, of course, especially among manufacturers
and financiers whose fortunes depended largely
on export and import business and in the South where
political attachments were nominally Democratic for special
reasons. But on the whole the major manufacturing and
financial interests were Republican, with all that signified
in terms of protective tariffs, taxation, banking, government
promotion of private enterprise, non-intervention in "the
natural distribution of wealth," and laissez faire in many
forms. And despite concessions to progressive and radical
factions, the Republicans hewed rather close to the party
line from 1921 to 1929, the period of so-called Republican
prosperity.

At all events during that period (1921--1929), manufacturing
and financial interests enjoyed a high degree of
prosperity. There was some unemployment among industrial
workers but the amount was not large enough to
produce wholesale disaffection in their ranks. Only among
farmers was there widespread economic distress. Although
that distress made itself felt in politics, it was not strong
enough to bring about a political overturn. Thus, Republican
politics had a fairly secure economic basis during those
years, while Democrats wandered in the political desert.
Had their economic basis continued to be firm, Republicans
might well have enjoyed an indefinite tenure of power.
The election returns for 1928 certainly pointed in that direction.

In 1929, however, "prosperity" went to pieces. How far
that crash was due to Republican policies, whether it could
have been avoided by Democratic politicians had they been
in power, and similar questions of "causation" are issues
which simply cannot be resolved by any kind of analysis,
economic, political, or historical. But according to the
scapegoat axiom of politics, the Republicans, who had
claimed credit for the prosperity, were discredited by the
depression, poverty, and unemployment which followed the
crack of 1929, and in the election of 1932 they were swept
out of office in an avalanche of votes.


[^/100]: Compiler's note: The bracketed start is mine.

This is not to argue that the voters in 1932 were convinced
that the Democrats could or would restore "prosperity,"
or provide a degree of economic well-being sufficient
to allay the political unrest which sprang from the
depression. Nor is there warrant for claiming that in the
campaign of 1932 the Democrats presented a clear outline
of just what they intended to do in the way of "restoring,"
"recovering," or "creating" prosperity. In fact, apart from
introducing various measures of regulation and social
security long overdue, the Democrats, under President
Franklin D. Roosevelt's leadership, failed to overcome the
depression by the policies they put into effect in his first
administration. In 1938 the number of unemployed workers
was at least three times the number recorded during the
peak months of "prosperity" under President Calvin Coolidge.
It was not until the boom created by preparations for
war and the still greater boom created by the war itself
that Democratic politics achieved a temporary "prosperity"
almost nation-wide in its range.

In the meantime, while the Democrats at the national
capital were wrestling with the dislocations in economy and
trying to get it into a higher speed of production, politics
was gaining in power over economics. In part this gain
represented a continuation of old tendencies, but in a
larger part it was marked by so much novelty that it could
be characterized, with some justification, as revolutionary
in upshot if not in purpose. In any case, drastic shifts were
effected in the methods of politics and in the economic
basis of politics. Of these shifts only a few can be listed
here, as illustrative.

At the head of the list belong the adoption and execution
of the policy of large-scale taxing, borrowing, and spending
for many purposes under government, or political,
auspices.

Among the purposes were: to stimulate and promote
private enterprise in industry and agriculture; to increase
the amount of employment; to provide economic security
for millions of dependent persons; to make preparations
for war; and to wage war, after 1941.

It is true that for some of these operations there were
precedents. When the panic broke in 1929 President
Herbert Hoover urged the expansion of federal spending
for public works and called upon the states to follow the
federal example; and in other ways federal money and
credit were used during the Hoover administration in aid
of private enterprise and home loan institutions. But the
degree of federal taxing, borrowing, and spending after
1933 reached such a height as to constitute an economic
overturn, far-reaching in its consequences.

By numerous and complicated measures, sometimes connected
with the policy of taxing and spending and sometimes
standing alone, manufacturing, commercial, financial,
and agricultural interests, once treated as primarily private
and as forming the chief economic basis of politics, were
made dependent upon politics to an extent which in this
respect signalized a breach with the past.

To describe the new network of relationships would
require a monumental treatise. Whole segments of industry,
business, and agriculture now rely heavily upon government
spending, for civilian and war purposes, as a main
source of the popular buying power that keeps economy in
motion and prosperity. Having lost their gold coins and
bullion to the federal government and having filled their
vaults with federal bonds and other paper, bankers have
become in a large measure mere agents of the government
in Washington. No longer do these powerful interests stand,
so to speak, "outside the government" and in a position to
control or dictate to it; all of them are closely linked in
their fortunes to the fortunes of politics.

This must not be taken to imply, of course, that the
powerful industrial and financial interests of the United
States have been expropriated according to the formula of
Marxian, as distinguished from American, communists or
that they have become the mere servants of "political men."
Far from it. The saying current in 1933 that the New Deal
had saved frightened capitalists from a destructive revolution
expressed a conviction then and still held by many
Democrats high in the councils of the party. Furthermore,
since 1933 numerous friends and patrons of the New Deal
have complained that great capitalists have been all along
entrenched in the strategic centers of the Roosevelt administrations.
The controversy in 1945 over the selection of
certain assistants as aides to the Secretary of State, Edward
Stettinius, himself a former associate of the powerful
Morgan interests, turned in part on this very point. So did
the dispute about the ousting of Jesse Jones from the
direction of federal lending agencies and the appointment
of Henry Wallace as Secretary of Commerce.

With regard to the alleged power of big capitalists in
the Roosevelt administrations two other facts have pertinence.
The long list of capitalist contributors to the Republican
campaign funds for the elections of 1936, 1940,
and 1944 indicates that the amount of power exercised by
capitalists in the federal government was not sufficient to
meet their own conceptions of their interests in innumerable
cases. Still more significant in this relation is the fact
that capitalism, free enterprise, and "trust-busting" somewhat
in the economic style of William Jennings Bryan in
1896 were supported by the very left wing of the New
Dealers headed by Henry Wallace, endorsed by leaders in
the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial
Organizations, and approved, temporarily at least,
by American communists of the Stalin school. The expropriation
of capitalists in favor of "political men" formed
no part of the New Deal program as of 1945. Nevertheless
in that year industrial and financial interests did not have
any such independent power in politics as they had exercised
in 1928 or 1916 or 1900.

During the evolution of the New Deal, another large
interest, formerly regarded as essentially private, has assumed
a semi-political and semi-official character. Fourteen
or fifteen million industrial and white-collar workers organized
in trades and general unions have acquired a
special position in law and have thus attached their fortunes
to the fortunes of politics. To consolidate and fortify this
attachment one of the national federations of labor --- the
Congress of Industrial Organizations --- established the Committee
for Political Action in 1944 and, with no little
reason, claimed to have assured the re-election of President
Roosevelt in that year.

Nominally as yet, organized labor possesses a high degree
of independence. But some of its privileges have been
won by political instead of economic action; and it has
entrusted the supervision of important elections and decisions
in union affairs to federal agencies, thus regularly
invoking the intervention and protection of the government
directly in behalf of its interests. To this extent it has become
entangled in the vicissitudes of politics and the state.
Although organized labor had participated in campaigns
and elections in limited ways for more than half a century,
the degree and nature of its participation in 1944 indicated
that it had reached a new stage in its relations to government
and politics, and had made a deeper plunge into the
opposition of interests that provides dynamics for politics,
especially where freedom of opinion and elections is practiced.[^/104]

To carry out New Deal policies in general and particular,
an enormous body of public officials and employees,
federal and state, has been added to the older and relatively
small bureaucracy. In other words, while the number
of private citizens and concerns enjoying direct benefits
from government expenditures increased, the apparatus of
government, central and local, reached proportions never
before attained in the United States. Now the political
party in power has a huge army of officeholders dependent
upon it for jobs, emoluments, promotion, and prestige, and
hence by interest inclined to keep it indefinitely in all
places of political authority.

Late in 1944 the United States Bureau of the Census
reported that the federal government had 3,335,000 civil
employees, and that state and local governments had
3,168,000, making a total of 6,503,000 public functionaries.
Estimating the number of inhabitants at 138,100,875, the
census bureau reckoned the number of place-holders at
nearly one in twenty of the population. Since each placeholder
usually has one or more family relatives, frequently
dependents, it becomes evident that this class, whose fortunes
are directly attached to those of government, is in a
position to wield immense power in politics and society. It
is true that in 1944 about two million of the civil employees
were in government places connected with the war and
that in time many of them may or will be returned to
private life. But even so, the number of place-holders will
remain large enough to exercise a decisive influence in
close elections under the rule of political equality --- "one
person, one vote." Hence it must be recorded that a new
kind of class has appeared in America: a large and permanent
bureaucracy composed of political men and women
whose economic support is derived mainly if not wholly
from politics.


[^/104]: Compiler's note: The merger of the American Federation
of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations into
one giant union, during 1956, would seem to clear the way for
more powerful participation by organized labor, as an economic
group, in American politics.

Under the policies of taxing, spending, regulating, and
promoting, politicians have put a special sort of floor under
their operating machine. Millions of farmers, industrialists,
industrial workers, and government employees are made
directly dependent upon government actions, that is, politics,
for part or all of their profits, wages, or other income.
Millions of aged and dependent persons are henceforward
to obtain all or a substantial portion of their economic
support from government, central or local or both in cooperation.
Until the war-boom demand for labor exceeded
the supply, millions of unemployed persons turned to the
federal government in search of employment or relief; but
the boom is admittedly temporary. An end to such prosperity
is inevitable.

The political party phase of the economic shifts is patent.
In former times party organizations had been maintained
principally by contributions from private economic interests
desirous of government favors. With funds derived
from such sources, party managers carried on campaigns
and employed many devices in influencing voters. But under
the new r√©gime Democratic politicians, while continuing
old ways of collecting party funds, merely have to
remind a multitude of voters that they depend directly and
immediately upon politics for innumerable tangible benefits
received. Indeed it is likely that few of these voters need
to be reminded of anything so daily obvious to them. Once
Republican politicians had overtly called the attention of
manufacturers to the benefits derived from Republican
tariff policies; but the number of voters immediately represented
by such interests was relatively small. Now the
number of voters receiving economic returns from politics
mounts upwards into the tens of millions. ...

While "the political man" has been gaining in authority
over "the economic man," American foreign policies and
wars since 1898 have rendered necessary the enlargement
of military interests in economy and politics. The significance
of this development must be appreciated in any effort
to understand the tendencies of our times; for it leads to
the expectation that "the military man" and "military
force" will play an increasing role in the public affairs of
the United States as well as in the affairs of other countries.

This outcome of recent war experiences was not wholly
unforeseen. For many years advocates of internationalism
have insisted that "nationalism" and "isolationism," as well
as "imperialism," require a huge military and naval establishment
--- "militarism," in short; and that only by a system
of collective security on a world scale can this menace to
civilian life and civilian government, including the burdensome
cost, be avoided.

Arguments of this kind were prominent in the debate
over the League of Nations at the close of the First World
War and provisions were made in the Versailles Treaty for
a reduction of armaments. Although the United States took
part in the general conference on that subject, no agreement
on reductions could be reached by the great Powers.
Again, before and after the United States became involved
in the Second World War, similar arguments respecting
the dangers of militarism were advanced in favor of American
participation in the war and in a permanent union of
nations to prevent militarism.

However, early in 1945, after victory over Germany and
Japan seemed assured and American membership in an
organization of nations for collective security appeared
almost certain, a demand arose in the United States for an
extensive program of armaments, including universal military
service, to be put into effect after the war as a permanent
national system. In his message to Congress on
January 6, 1945, President Roosevelt declared himself in
favor of making universal training a regular feature of
American military policy after peace was restored. It is
true that he insisted on the creation of an international
organization for collective security, but he evidently did
not deem the achievement of that design a sufficient guarantee
for the protection of the United States against foreign
dangers.

If the new policy is adopted,[^/1071] then the United States will
have a gigantic military and naval establishment, modeled
more or less on similar institutions long maintained by the
great Powers of the world. That will be followed by an
immense growth in the number of persons, especially officers,
devoted entirely to the occupations of the armed services.
This is not to contend that military men are more
warlike than civilians; often they are in fact less warlike.
But military men have, necessarily, a set of values which
differ in many respects from civilian values; and the military
interests, enlarged by universal conscription, will constitute
a powerful influence in American affairs, with all
that may involve amid the domestic and foreign contingencies
of coming ages. ...

\[Moreover, outside the United States,\][^/1072] there has been
a large-scale revival of belief in, quest for, and exercise of
unlimited power in government as an end in itself or as a
means to class, national, and imperialistic ends. Power has,
of course, always been a characteristic of the state; but in
the nineteenth century, with the growth of the middle class
and the rise of democracy, it looked for a time as if autocratic
authority was everywhere to be controlled by constitutional
restraints in the interest of popular welfare and
liberty of expression, person, and property. In nations
which had made the most effective advances toward constitutional
government, such as Great Britain and the
United States, it was widely assumed that arbitrary power
had been definitely subdued to "the will of the people."
Although in other countries at the opening of the twentieth
century, for example, Tsarist Russia, Imperial Japan, and
Imperial Germany, popular supremacy had not been attained,
even there movements in the direction of constitutional
government were under way.

When the absolutist order in Russia broke down during
the First World War of our century, efforts were made to
erect a constitutional system of government; but they
failed, and power was seized by a communist faction under
the leadership of a few determined men, notably V. I.
Lenin and Leon Trotsky. To this type of power-action a
new name was applied --- Bolshevism. In sum and substance
the philosophy of Bolshevism asserted the right of a small
and resolute group to take power "in the name of the
proletariat," to set up its own state, and to reduce the rest
of the people to obedience.

For this arbitrary seizure and exercise of power the
philosophers of Bolshevism, Lenin for instance, had at
their command and proclaimed a moral or ideal justification.
The dictatorship in the name of the proletariat was to
be regarded as temporary, as the forerunner of equality
and liberty to come after the state had "withered away."
In the ideal order of the future the proletariat as well as
every other class was to disappear and "the administration
of things" by and for the good of the people was to supplant
"the government of men."

In other parts of Europe, after the close of the First
World War, the drive for democracy and constitutional
government seemed to gain momentum for a period. Constitutions
popular in form and containing bills of rights
were adopted in Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia, and other
European countries, and the suffrage was widened in
Japan. But within a few years a reaction occurred, first in
Italy. In several countries, governments established by the
seizure of power and exercising unlimited power superseded
governments checked by popular will and civil liberties.

To this new form of arbitrary power the name of
Fascism was generally applied, even to the German type ---
Nazism. The Fascist state, notwithstanding variations, was
the creation of a militant leader and his followers whose
authority was sustained by terror and arms, even when
some political stratagem was used. By philosphy and
action, Fascism repudiated the ideal aims asserted by Bolshevism
and likewise the institutions of democracy, constitutionalism,
and civil liberty. It exalted and sought to
fix permanently the right of a self-chosen √©lite to rule the
rest of the people by the sword and the police. This fact
was not and could not be disguised by any of the so-called
"corporative constitutions" which Fascism proposed or produced
in Italy or Spain.

Although Bolshevism and Fascism differed as to the
proclaimed objectives, they agreed in their repudiation of
constitutional government as understood in the West.
Exponents of both ideologies treated democracy, elections,
freedom of the press, and parliamentary politics as a
kind of smoke-screen --- "a mask for capitalism," to quote
Benito Mussolini --- devised by the bourgeoisie to conceal
its "class dictatorship." In neither system of theory and
practice was there any place for government by political
majorities victorious at regular elections or for independent
courts to uphold civil liberties against attacks by
government officials. In short, both unqualifiedly rejected
the democratic doctrine of political equality (above, Chapter
V). While the Russian communists adopted in 1936 a
constitution including a paper program of civil liberties,
they were careful to keep sovereign power in the hands of
the few --- within the communist leadership and the party
organization as directed by the supreme leader.

In ways utterly immeasurable and indescribable, two
world wars have also altered the social, intellectual, and
moral setting in which the theory of the economic basis
of politics was discussed prior to 1914. From Aristotle's
time down through the centuries the theory had been
limited by the condition that economic forces operate
freely only in the absence of military force (above, pp.
29, 31, 38 ff., 44, 64); but during the long period
between the close of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 and the
opening of the First World War in 1914, the conditional
clause, which severely limited the theory, had been regarded
as largely academic, particularly in the United
States. Now a single generation has experienced the shattering
impacts of military force around the globe on a
scale beyond all precedents. Not an aspect of life --- economic,
political, intellectual or emotional --- has escaped its
actions and devastations. During the momentous years
since 1914 "the military man" has again entered into full
competition with "the economic man" and "the political
man" for power over the state and its fortunes. ...

Notwithstanding variations in the types of Fascism, particularly
in "racist" theories and practices, the political and
economic formulas and actions of Fascism were substantially
identical wherever it appeared. The leader, supported
by armed bands, was the head of the state --- indeed the
state itself; and the institutions associated with constitutional
government and civil liberty were suppressed. All
property was not taken over by the Fascist state, as it had
been in Russia. Nor were the upper, middle, and farming
classes liquidated. But the uses of property and the enjoyment
of fruits and profits from property were so restricted
as to destroy innumerable rights of persons in property as
historically understood and defined.

It is true that the Weimar constitution designed for a
republic in Germany after the First World War was not
formally and entirely discarded by the Nazis. Yet for all
practical purposes it was abolished. In Italy some efforts
were made to give a voice in government to corporations,
that is, to grant representation to specific organized classes
--- managerial, industrial, and commercial, for example ---
but these classes were denied all power of free choice in
the selection of their agents. It was alleged in Italy that
the goal of Fascism was the creation of "the corporative
state," reproducing in a modern form something like the
class hierarchy of estates in the middle ages. No such end
was actually achieved, however. State power under Fascism
in Italy as well as elsewhere remained absolutely independent
of the people considered as political or economic
individuals or as members of private associations. Economic
interests of all kinds were in theory, and to a large
extent in practice, subdued to the will of the state --- narnely,
to the dictator, checked if at all only by the advice of his
party council. Protests were smothered by the police.

Many attempts have been made to explain the rise and
growth of the Fascist state in terms almost purely economic,
as if the Fascist dictator and his colleagues were the
mere automata of interests called "capitalistic." It has been
claimed that Fascism was the logical and inevitable answer
of sheer capitalist power to the menace of sheer communist
power. Another explanation is to the effect that
Fascism was simply the product of the unemployment,
poverty, and social unrest which came in the wake of the
First World War --- economic distresses with which democratic
and parliamentary governments could not cope. A
communist formula of explanation declares that Fascism is
the last stage of exploitive capitalism and is to be succeeded
by the final revolutionary triumph of the industrial
proletariat under the banner of communism.

In the name of free enterprise or laissez-faire capitalism
another economic explanation of Fascism has been offered;
for instance, in F. A. Hayek's The Road to Serfdom. According
to this thesis "the rise of Fascism and Nazism was
not a reaction against the socialist trends of the preceding
period but a necessary outcome of these tendencies." In
other words, Fascism, in its German and Italian expression
and in incipient expressions elsewhere, was due to the
abandonment of the individualist tradition, the growth of
capitalistic monopolies, the suppression of free competition,
and the adoption of state intervention or planning
in economy. Thus the Western democracies, as well as
other countries, are on the road that leads to Fascist serfdom,
for they have adopted protective tariffs, planning, and
other types of state interference with the old "natural
order of things" in which the competition of individuals
prevailed. Here no distinction is made between state intervention
by despotisms and state intervention by constitutional
governments under popular mandates. Intervention
in economy _per se_ leads to Fascism.

Certainly economic interests figured in the rise and
growth of Fascism. There were grave economic disturbances
in Italy when Mussolini came to power in that
country and undoubtedly the great depression in Germany
made it easier for Hitler to seize the state in 1933.
Unquestionably both Mussolini and Hitler appealed to
industrial workers, peasants, and the lower middle classes
as against the rich and the insurgent communists. Hitler
practically promised "the people" everything they thought
they wanted. Indisputably the two rising dictators received
monetary aid from large financial and industrial interests.
In both countries, perhaps more in Italy than in
Germany, big industrialists were often granted special favors
at the expense of the lower middle and laboring classes.

But purely economic interpretations of the rise, growth,
and nature of Fascism are oversimplifications. They rest
upon a theory of the economic basis of politics unqualified
by the condition attached to it by the keenest thinkers who
made use of it --- the condition that only in the absence of
military force does political power pass into the hands of
those who hold the property (above, p. 38 ff.). This is to
say that oversimplified economic interpretations treat economic
interests as if they are always and everywhere independent
"causes" of political actions and institutions; as if
they universally furnish the most powerful if not the sole
impetus to political action for the conquest of power in the
state, in times of war, civil and foreign, as well as in times
of peace.

Economic explanations pure and simple leave out of the
reckoning other aspects of human motivation; for instance,
the ambitions and force of unique personalities; the spirit
of resentment in Italy over the curt treatment received at
Versailles in 1919; and the passion for revenge in Germany
after defeat in the First World War. They ignore
the role played in Fascism by those soldiers of that war
who were still filled with passion for destroying, killing,
and dominating. Nor must it be forgotten that the elements
of Fascist ideology had long been awaiting use by activists
in search of adventure and power in the war-torn world.
Among these elements were the racial doctrines of Count
Gobineau and H. S. Chamberlain; anti-semitic diatribes;
virulent abuse of "democracy" and "civilization"; exaltations
of irrationality and violence as masculine virtues;
and the systematic formulations of Sorel, Mosca, and
Pareto in criticism of the masses and popular government.
Economic forces undoubtedly entered into the rise of
Fascism but they do not wholly account for its appearance
and course. ...

### A Reconsideration of the Economic Thesis

In reconsidering an idea as deeply entangled in powerful
interests as the idea of the economic basis of politics,
no person can hope to be wholly "disinterested," wholly
detached and Olympian. He may strive to follow the example
of Descartes and put preconceptions out of his
mind, but he is almost certain to find them returning,
perhaps by the "back door," as Descartes did. We are not
under obligations to accept the associational psychology of
John Locke as the whole truth; yet we are all, in some
measure, victims of ideas derived from our experiences and
associations.

There are few, if any, ideas relative to human affairs
which all men and women of every class, clime, race,
nation, and age can look upon coldly and agree upon as
readily as they can upon the proposition that the circumference
of a circle is equal to 3.1416 times its diameter,
approximately. Certainly the proposition that "in
the absence of military force, political power naturally and
necessarily goes into the hands which hold the property" is
not a statement likely to be viewed with chill detachment
and universally accepted, defended, or criticized without
emotion.

Even so, this does not imply that we may not with some
success seek the utmost truth about particular aspects of
human affairs in detail and in general. Indeed by an informed
awareness of relevant preconceptions --- sectarian,
partisan, and factional, including our own --- we may to
some extent rise above them or shake off their tyranny. At
all events, the theory of the economic basis of politics may
be more effectively reconsidered if these admonitions are
kept in mind.

Although this theory is ancient in origin, the modern
statement of it was formulated in particular circumstances
and on the basis of assumptions connected with those circumstances.
It was in England and the United States that
the thesis was earliest promulgated in comprehensive form
and applied to practical politics. And in England civilian
supremacy over the monarchy and army was attained by
the end of the seventeenth century; in the United States
civilian supremacy over all armed forces was guaranteed
by the Constitution which went into effect in 1789.

The geographical position of these two countries, given
the state of war technology, made unnecessary the maintenance
of huge armies for purposes of offense or defense.
While high standing was accorded to the military man in
both nations, military virtues were subordinated to civilian
virtues --- in economic terms, industrial, commercial, and
agricultural virtues. In England and the United States,
from the latter part of the eighteenth century onward, constitutional
government, with emphasis on civil liberties,
generally prevailed; thus conditions favored the easy expression
of economic interests in politics, and the exercise
of power by such interests in affairs of state. Upon the assumption
that these conditions would continue indefinitely,
politics was extensively treated as if the theory of the economic
basis of politics supplied the criteria for "explaining"
politics always and everywhere.

It should also be remembered that Karl Marx, who reduced
all history to class struggles and formulated the
theory of materialist determinism near the middle of the
nineteenth century, conducted his major economic studies
in England and used English capitalism as the classic example.
It is true that Marx and his collaborator, Friedrich
Engels, gave some attention to war as a social phenomenon;
but neither of them substantially qualified his "economic
man" by reference to the role of the military man
in universal history. In fact, Marx built his system largely
on Manchester economics and then evolved his own theory
of social dynamics, know as dialectical materialism. It
may be truly said that in some ways he was a victim of
capitalistic theories then in vogue and of Hegelian metaphysics.

The general conception of Manchesterism as applied to
universal history was, up to a certain point, almost identical
with that of Marxism. Capitalism was bound to spread
throughout the world, reaching at length the most remote
and backward places. Old military societies were to be
transformed into industrial societies. "The economic man"
would completely subdue "the military man," the state
would shrink, and the administration of things for human
welfare would take the place of government by force.
Manchesterism saw this occurring as the area of capitalistic
laissez faire was extended and as free trade among nations
was progressively realized; and Marx introduced a proletarian
revolution as a prelude to universal liberty and
well-being. But both systems of historical interpretation
looked forward to world peace, economic prosperity, and
the decline, if not the disappearance, of "the military man"
and the state. Even Marx himself thought that the socialist
transformation might be effected in England and the
United States by constitutional as distinguished from violent
methods.

Nevertheless the prophecies of Manchesterism and
Marxism have not been realized. The whole world has not
been fully industrialized or turned to the peaceful pursuits
of economic production. In recent years the area of the
earth occupied by constitutional and democratic governments
has diminished rather than increased. The multitude
of people living under the sword of empires and
under dictatorial states maintained by military force outnumbers
by far the multitude living under systems of government
which allow a high degree of economic and political
liberty. "The political man" and "the military man"
have gained at the expense of "the economic man." The
state has not withered away, as the communists once confidently
predicted, even under communism as enforced in
Russia. Calculations respecting the future of both economic
and political forces must still be balanced by calculations
as to the possible weight of sheer power and the sword in
the years ahead.

Yet amid recent changes one thing remains certain.
Politics, including military aspects, must have an economic
basis or perish. People must have food, clothing, and
shelter before and while they engage in politics and fighting.
Whatever the formulas for the ownership and use of
property, the state --- despotic or democratic --- must secure
for itself an economic underwriting sufficient to sustain it
or it will in fact wither away, as many states and empires
have in the past. "The man of war," with his insatiable
demand for materials, is even more than ever dependent
upon economic production and, if he strives for political
sovereignty, he must make sure that an adequate economic
underpinning is provided or he will be destroyed by
his own works. It is in these circumstances and subject to
such qualifications that the economic basis of politics needs
re-examination; for it is a fundamental consideration in
statecraft everywhere, all the time.

With economics left out of account, political science
cannot rise much above the level of astrology. But when
the forms and ownership of property, the productive
methods, the economic institutions, and the economic
groups and ideas of a given society have been described
with the utmost accuracy and when long-term trends in
the past have been plotted, pure analysis and representative
thought have about reached the limits of their procedure.
The findings and trends thus disclosed do not constitute
an exact science which permits sure predictions as to the
definite political consequences that will inexorably flow
from the total economic situation or the trends.

Here then we confront the problem of great history, in
which all economic, political, military, and other events
take place. Inevitably, we also face the central problem of
historiography and philosophy: the origin, nature, dynamics,
and capacities of human beings in relation to one
another and their environment.

But the human mind cannot actually lay hold of things
alleged to be "original causes," or things called "causes"
in the subsequent flow of personalities and events, and
see them functioning independently in particular ways at
particular times with inescapable effects discernible to the
eye. We cannot picture realistically in the mind economic
events or forces operating against "politics" and producing
political "effects," as we can, for instance, picture a locomotive
coming up behind a train of cars and pushing it
ahead to a given destination. Such physical or mechanical
images correspond to none of the realities associated
with economic interests and activities in conjuncture with
political interests and activities.

We may, of course, adopt some such formula as "economics
comes first and determines politics." But this is an
arbitrary act of will, and the formula is untenable in view
of relevant historical knowledge. Human beings had to eat
in order to live and they began eating before they established
great societies and states; but human beings were
more than mere eating-animals even in the most primitive
times of which we have knowledge. At an early stage in
social evolution, economics and government, such as they
were, became inextricably entangled, and their influences
upon each other were reciprocal. Not since the beginning
of recorded history has this involved relationship been
broken: economic changes have affected governments and
changes in governments have affected economic institutions
and interests. But the problem of which precedes which or
what comes first has not been solved by any process of
learning or thinking.

Unless we are to remain indefinitely in indecisive meditation
upon an unanswerable question, the knot which cannot
be unraveled by philosophy or historical inquiry and
speculation must be cut by considering the economic basis
of politics in terms of action. At bottom, the problem of
comprehending, using, and testing the theory or fiction
thus becomes one in active statecraft for all reflective persons
concerned with living and operating in relation to
public affairs. Immediately the theory, which is in itself
mere idea, is attached to inner images and impulses and to
visible circumstances. Having resolved to act, such persons
will clarify their purposes as to economic or political ends,
will make use of systematic knowledge and thought relative
to economic and political interests, will strive to discern
what is inescapable in the given conjuncture of
events, and will at length come to a judgment on the
general situation with reference to the time and form of
proposed actions and their probable consequences.

Stated in another way, the political science of pure
thought as an end in itself can ignore the economic basis
of politics, but the political science of action cannot ---
unless forsooth it is wholly irrational and hence doomed to
self-destruction. If rational, it will employ systematic
knowledge of economic institutions, interests, and forces
in all their forms, make conjectures or forecasts derived
from this knowledge, reach informed judgments respecting
the general situation and its details, make decisions so
instructed, take appropriate actions, and submit the outcome
to the test of human experience.

But here the absolutist who is sure that he knows precisely
what will happen in every contingency, real or
imagined, will file objections. He will declare that the above
conclusion discloses no indefeasible or mathematical laws
governing human affairs which will permit certainty in
predictions and hence make perfectly plain the right thing
to do or say at the right moment in order to accomplish a
given end or ends. Besides, he will complain, it introduces
the factor of human judgment, which is fallible and belongs
to intuition, not knowledge and certainty; it is therefore
"mystical" and "unscientific."

To such objections answers are possible. If human affairs
are in fact determined under indefeasible or mathematical
law, human beings are creatures of fate and have no
choices, good or bad, as to the right thing to do or say at
any time. They are mere automata in history. With reference
to the factor of judgment or intuition, it also appears
in the process of formulating theories of physical
science, which may or may not be later subjected to the
tests of action. At all events, human beings conduct their
affairs as if they possess the power of insight, judgment,
and choice.

In his volume The Domain of Natural Science, one of
the most thoughtful and penetrating works on the subject,
E. W. Hobson says (p. 460) that there are two kinds of
scientific knowledge: the systematic scheme and the unsystematic
synthesis (from which elements of the former
may not be absent). "But besides these kinds of knowledge,
there exists a kind of apprehension which is more immediate
and direct, although it is often inextricably combined
with knowledge of the other kinds. This knowledge
is given by direct intuition, in which the object in the
subject-object relation is apparently apprehended all at
once, as a whole, and not by a conscious synthesis of all
its parts and their relations. ... An exceptional power
of obtaining an intuitional grasp of a complex as a whole
is an essential element in the mental outfit of a man of
science of the highest order."

The exercise of "intuitional and imaginative apprehension"
is prominent in the history of all the great statecraft
that has steered nations through the storms of war
and revolution and through years of advancing civilization
in times of peace. An example of such statecraft on a
large scale is to be found in the proceedings of the men
who framed the Constitution of the United States in 1787.
These men had at their command knowledge, both systematic
and unsystematic; they were familiar with the history
of government, tyranny, violence, and liberty; they
were intimately acquainted with the political and economic
interests involved directly and indirectly in their own undertaking.
But, given the nature of their resolve to act, they
also had to deal with imponderables, immeasurables, and
unpredictables; to make calculations respecting the possibilities
and probabilities of the occasion; to pass judgment
on the general situation; and finally, without being
certain as to the outcome, to make a decision on the forms
of actions to be risked, in the hope of attaining the ends
of union, government, and liberty, projected in the paper
draft of the Constitution submitted to ratifying bodies and
to validation by events.

By way of summary, the theory of the economic basis
of politics may be restated in the following formulas:

Revolutions and wars on a world-shaking scale have
been accompanied by accelerated alterations in the forms
and functions of economies and governments.

If historical experience is any guide, drastic changes in
economy will find expression in politics; and, on the other
hand, changes in the functions of government will be followed
by repercussions in economy.

In every civilized society, whatever the nature, ownership,
and law of property, a diversity of economic interests
appears and "the most common and durable source" of
clashing interests in politics is the various and unequal
distribution of property or income (above, pp. 35--6).

The practice of democracy as government by the will of
majorities or pluralities, under the theory of free and
equal heads, does not eliminate economic interests, prevent
collisions among them, or guarantee a pacific conduct
of government or an efficient solution of contradictions
(above, Chapter VI).

In the absence of military force, economic interests will
come to expression in political power.

If private economic interests, having achieved political
power, cannot provide an efficient economic underpinning
of society in the long run, they will lose their sovereignty
to politics or military force.

If by force or stratagem politics achieves sovereignty
over all private economic interests, it will have to maintain
an efficient economic basis of its own or perish for
want of life-giving support.

If military force triumphs over both economics and
politics, it must assure an economic basis of its own or
collapse amid the ruins of sterile power.

If there are no individual or group economic interests
possessing a high degree of independence as against the
state, despotism will supplant constitutional government
and then run its own historic course.

In the absence of military force, under constitutional
government, that is, limited government, against which a
high degree of freedom is provided by the supreme law,
the statecraft loyal to such government is under obligation
to recognize the nature and existence of economic interests,
promote certain interests in particular times and
circumstances, restrain specific interests in particular times
and places, and in general facilitate voluntary and compulsory
adjustments of conflicting interests within the
framework of some common civil policy.

The principal alternative to such constitutional government
and practice of statecraft is the pursuit of specific interests
to the bitter end --- to the test of sheer power to the
uttermost. This will culminate in a resort to arms by one
or more of the conflicting interests and may eventuate in
the triumph of one among them (or a coalition); or, if
long historical experience is conclusive, will result in the
destruction of all factions in the ordeal of violence.

The realities to which the above formulas refer come
within the sweep of total history in time. They are not
self-contained and independent "tracts of matter and
force." They are enmeshed in other human characteristics
and events --- biological, mental, moral, artistic, and religious
--- that also appear in total history. The origins of
total history, like \[those\] of the physical universe, are
shrouded in the darkness of pre-history, and the law or
laws of total history, if there be any, have not been discovered.
Given the fragmentary evidences available, these
origins and law or laws cannot be discovered by the human
mind. Hence the above formulas of economics and politics
are not "laws of history" but are in the nature of conditioned
and conditional axioms respecting probabilities of
high degree, subject to modifications by the acquisition of
new knowledge and by the experiences of a future that
cannot be forecast with any mathematical or descriptive
certainty worthy of the name.
