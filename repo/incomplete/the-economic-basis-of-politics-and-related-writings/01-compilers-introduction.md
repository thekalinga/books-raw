## Compiler's Introduction

It is comparatively safe and easy to describe the past
in terms of the surface manifestations of politics --- such
as the provisions of the Constitution of the United States
as presented to the states for adoption in 1787, or the
official wording of papers traded among diplomats during
major disputes over foreign policy. Charles A. Beard was
much too outspoken, however, and far too inquisitive to
be satisfied with a limited program of this nature. In the
course of a long, active, and often stormy career as a
writer and university professor, he probed deeply behind
the scenes in quest of basic economic explanations for
major political developments. What was the alignment of
commercial interests during the writing of the Constitution
of the United States? What business motives found expression
in the messages dispatched by the government of
one nation to that of another, in periods of tension over
faraway places? Questions such as these he did not hesitate
to discuss openly in print.

Researches in this vein gave rise to a wealth of argument,
some of it very heated. "Idealists" who denied that economics
had exerted anything like the influence on political
affairs Beard was said to have claimed, lashed out at him
as a "materialist" --- one who sought to undermine humankind's
claim to disinterested nobility of character. Marxians
complained that his labors neglected to provide that
special brand of economic insight into events which, in
their judgment, alone afforded a "correct" understanding
of political history. Some took a more neutral position,
recognizing fundamental value in Beard's work yet differing
with him as to certain details and emphases. Still others
were enthusiastic followers, hailing him as one who had
dared to open valuable new areas to research.

Publicized not only by a host of friends but by foes as
well --- who felt his work was much too challenging to be
ignored --- Beard's labors exerted tremendous influence.
Over ten million copies of histories bearing his name have
been sold, many of them stressing economic considerations
in political history. He attained the Presidency of both the
American Historical Association and the American Political
Science Association. His The Economic Basis of
Politics was translated into German, supplied with a special
introduction by a member of the American Military Government,
and then employed in the "re-education" of Germans
in their homeland, following the Second World War.[^/1]
To cite another example, the Columbia network devoted
a half-hour nation-wide broadcast, on October 24, 1954, to
a discussion by Norman Thomas, David Denker, and
Lyman Bryson on the lasting importance of Beard's An
Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United
States. Further evidence of the vitality of Beard's ideas is
afforded by a recent bibliography of published comments
on them.[^/2]

Yet inquirers seeking a convenient cross-section of
Beard's thinking on the subject of the impact of economics
on political history have long found it difficult to obtain a
representative sampling of his labors. Not only were his
contributions to the topic widely scattered and aimed at
diverse objectives, but numerous of his works have been
out of print for years --- and could ordinarily be inspected
only after making special arrangements with a few major
libraries or eliciting the sympathetic help of secondhandbook
sellers. The present volume was undertaken in an
effort to provide easier access to his passages on the
subject. Following a preliminary sketch of his familiarity
with pioneers in this field, and his manifold personal contacts
with the everyday economic life about him, it offers
selections from his writings which, it is hoped, will give
greater understanding of the breadth of his interest in, and
knowledge of, the interplay of economics and politics
through many centuries of Western history.[^/3]

The great bulk of the material offered here is from
volumes or periodicals now otherwise completely out of
print. Those wishing to supplement the text with books
still readily available directly from publishers' stocks are
advised that at this writing (August, 1956) The Macmillan
Co. had on hand Beard's An Economic Interpretation of
the Constitution of the United States (1913) and Economic
Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy (1915). It is
the opinion of the compiler of the present volume that to
have inserted sizable passages from either or both of these
treatises here would have markedly reduced the availability
of Beard's writings by forcing compensating omissions
of hard-to-get material and would have seriously diminished
the space devoted to a much broader consideration
of historiography and of the economic features of political
history than these two specialized studies provide.

While the passages bound within these covers are representative
of much of Beard's thinking on the subject at
hand, they fall somewhat short of finality. The one prime
task he felt he had left undone when, in the words of
Johannes von MÃ¼ller, "he stepped down to join the
shadows he had depicted," was the preparation of a
popularly written volume on history which would clarify
still further the nature of his labors --- and those of others
in the "historical guild." That it would have commented on
the "economic interpretation" of history seems highly
probable. At least, in talks about "unfinished business," he
discussed the tendency of one side in a political dispute to
overemphasize the "low" economic motives of the opposition,
thus affording a specious explanation of events, and
the question whether an economic interpretation is more
acceptable to a society in the midst of an economic depression,
and an idealistic one more welcome in days of
prosperity. Certain ages and periods, he said, might lend
themselves more precisely to an economic interpretation
than others. In the former category might come the time
when Marx lived and wrote, while to the latter might be
assigned the years immediately preceding the American
Civil War. Hence it seems likely that Beard, had he had
the opportunity, would have altered and rearranged the
ideas forming the bulk of this volume, to bring them
abreast of his more mature thinking at the close of his
life.

From whence came Beard's deep and abiding interest,
up to the very end, in economic factors underlying past
political events? As he has indicated, it was derived in
part from the study of the printed works of others who had
engaged in such explorations long ago.

Included in the great mine of ideas on economics and
politics from which he drew were the thoughts of Aristotle
(384--322 B.C.) who: "When he approaches ... causes
of variations in the forms of the state ... immediately relates
economics and politics" (below, p. 27). Of a later
contributor, Beard remarks that: "In advising the prince,
once established, how best to maintain his power, Machiavelli
\[1469--1527\] warns him to take account of the conflict
of classes out of which political power springs. ..."
(Below, p. 31.) Beard also notes that: "Both the origin
and end of the state Locke \[1632--1704\] finds in the roots
of property." (Below, p. 33.) Discussing a more recent
period, Beard declares that Barnave, in writing about the
French Revolution: "displayed a remarkable insight into
the economic causes of the struggle. Long before Marx,
Barnave had written 'as soon as industry and commerce
have entered into the life of a nation and have created a
new source of wealth for the support of the working
class, a revolution in political institutions begins. A new
distribution of wealth produces a new distribution of
power. ...'"[^/4] Of the Marxians Beard wrote: "In the
field of history Marx and his followers undoubtedly helped
to turn the attention of historians from purely political
and diplomatic affairs to the more permanent and fundamental
forces in the development and conflict of nations.
..."[^/5] A careful study of numerous other citations
given by Beard would permit lengthy expansion of the
above list.

Less well-known, perhaps, than his debt to his literary
predecessors is the fact that Beard, unlike many historians
whose activities have been more largely confined to academic
circles, was in unusually close and stimulating contact
with the everyday economic life about him, and with
its varied political ramifications. These personal experiences
supplemented the impetus for economic analysis provided
by quiet reading.

Beard's direct insight into the stern realities of agriculture,
for example, began as soon as he was old enough
to shoulder his share of the hard work required to keep
his parents' large Indiana farm operating properly. Though
he "escaped" from this routine in early manhood to devote
himself to study, writing, and teaching, his interest in
the soil remained very much alive. In 1929, he acquired
a farm covering some three hundred rolling acres in Connecticut,
about ten miles from his own residence at New
Milford. On this new tract he housed a farm family and
through it entered commercial dairying on an extensive
scale. True, others performed the physical labor, but
Beard made frequent visits to this enterprise and took an
active part in its management. For a time, he even ran a
second major dairy farm in Connecticut, but mounting
burdens finally induced him to shrink his undertakings to
the confines of his earlier farm, which was still in full
swing at the moment of his death, in 1948.

Busy as he was with writing, he still did not shirk his
responsibilities as a citizen-farmer. During a threatened
strike of Connecticut dairy farmers in 1933, in co-operation
with another "scholar in politics," Governor Wilbur
Cross, he took a hand in meeting the emergency. Important
gatherings were held in the Beard residence at this
juncture and Beard not only helped to develop plans to
cope with the crisis but advised fellow farmers as to how to
present their problems to the public for appropriate political
action. When, therefore, Beard examined the writings
of such thinkers as Aristotle and Jefferson on the subject
of the place of the farmer in the economic and political
life of the community, he had a better than average comprehension
of the substance of their remarks.

Beard was also closely associated with capital and labor
in commerce and industry. As a boy, he observed his father
carrying on a successful contracting and building business
in Indiana and otherwise participating in the economic life
of the community. As Beard described this formative
period: "My early memories are filled with the stories of
log-cabin days --- of community helpfulness, of co-operation
in building houses and barns, in harvesting crops, in
building schools, in constructing roads and bridges, in
nursing the sick, in caring for widows, orphans and the
aged. Of individuals I heard much, of individualism little.
I doubt whether anywhere in the United States there was
more community spirit, more mutual aid in all times of
need, so little expectation of material reward for services
rendered to neighbors."[^/6]

To fill the interlude between high school and college,
the father devoted some of his funds to the purchase of the
Knightstown Banner for his two sons, Charles and Clarence.
They proceeded to write, manage, and in emergencies
apparently set type for this small-town journal, thus receiving
valuable training in the expression of ideas, community
service, and the management of funds.

After leaving the Banner and graduating from De Pauw
University, Beard went to England for graduate study.
There he traveled extensively through the "black country,"
so named from its many smoking chimneys, witnessing at
first hand the stark realism of the English factory system.
Greatly stirred by these sights, he studied the history of
the industrial revolution in the British Isles and undertook
to put his knowledge to practical use by helping to found
and operate a workingmen's college at Oxford. Moreover,
he lectured for the English co-operative societies which
were then trying to find a practical way to reduce the ordinary
worker's cost of living.

Following his return to the United States, the success
of his writing ventures ultimately made it possible for him
to invest in a variety of American corporations. One of
his possessions consisted of a block of Missouri Pacific
Railway bonds. When a group of bankers sought to reorganize
that carrier in a manner Beard deemed inimical
to the welfare of the purchasers of these underlying securities,
he organized a bondholders' committee and challenged
the might not only of the Van Sweringens but of
J. P. Morgan and Company as well. His outspoken comments
on the bankers' operations received wide publicity
in the press and produced important political repercussions
in the halls of Congress.

Through his services with the Bureau of Municipal Research
in New York City, Beard participated directly in
the struggle among economic interests that forms much of
the substance of state and local politics. For example, he
played an important part in Governor Alfred E. Smith's
drive to reorganize the administration of New York State
to reduce waste, inefficiency, and bungling, and, at the
municipal level, Beard tackled the likewise difficult task of
reviewing the conflicting opinions of powerful groups,
during the serious traction crisis of 1919 in New York
City, in an effort to arrive at some practical solution for
the emergency.

Beard's understanding of economic issues in politics was
further enhanced by extensive foreign travels. He saw the
breakdown in European economy following World War
I, in England, France and Italy, and the diverse reactions
of the public thereto --- including a large street riot associated
with Mussolini's rise to power. Later, he journeyed
far and wide in the Orient --- traversing China from port
cities along the coast to the far interior, incidentally getting
a glimpse of an American naval patrol, anchored
several hundred miles up the Yangtze Kiang River. He
visited England's imperial outpost at Hong Kong and
Japan's colonial enterprises in Manchuria and Korea.
Through the courtesy of a former Japanese governor of
the Island, he penetrated deep into the jungles of Formosa,
to reach a region where efforts were being made to adapt
former head-hunting savages to the requirements of the
camphor industry.

As an adviser to the Tokyo Institute for Municipal Research,
both before and after the disastrous earthquake
of 1923, Beard was drawn into the contest among economic
groups over broad plans for the more effective reconstruction
of the metropolis. A few years later, in 1927
and 1928, he was back in Europe, this time laboring in
Yugoslavia for the American-Yugoslav Society, examining
the special economic and political problems of that newborn
and struggling nation.

Being deeply aware of the vitality and importance of
the economic drive in politics, by reading and by direct
personal contact, Beard undertook to describe the linkage
fearlessly and at length, in print.
