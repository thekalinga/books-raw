## Restoration and Healing[^/244]

"America's present need is not heroics but healing; not
nostrums but normalcy," exclaimed Senator Warren Gamaliel
Harding in an address delivered to Boston businessmen
in the spring of 1920. ... He was himself of the
McKinley school and knew very well that for nearly two
decades the course of business enterprise had been disturbed;
first by Roosevelt and then by Wilson.

Strictly speaking, both of them could be regarded as
"political accidents." Roosevelt had been elevated to the
Presidency by the assassination of McKinley. Wilson had
slipped into that high office during a scrimmage in the
Republican camp. All the while the number of people
engaged in business enterprise, as distinguished from
agriculture, and the amount of capital employed in that
branch of economy had been increasing. There was some
justification for believing that the clock started by Alexander
Hamilton could not be set back.

If Wilson's legislation was directed to farmers, planters,
trade unionists, and the lower middle classes, it certainly
did not seriously cripple industrial undertakings, perhaps
because the demand of the warriors in Europe more than
made up for losses in the domestic market. At all events,
the World War made several thousand millionaires in the
United States, thereby adding strength to the Republican,
rather than the Democratic, side of the political alignment.

With fitting propriety, the Republicans nominated as
their candidate for President, in 1920, the maker of the
captivating slogan, "normalcy."... In the campaign
which followed, it was made perfectly clear that normalcy
meant a return to a high protective tariff, a reduction in
income and inheritance taxes, less "government interference
with business," vigorous naval and diplomatic support
for foreign commerce, and a resort to "firm policies" in
the Philippines and the Far East. Against this program,
the Democrats offered the record of the Wilson administrations
and the League of Nations.


[^/244]: From Chapter VIII of The American Party Battle, Macmillan
(1928).

... On the whole, the Republican leaders of practical
experience were against the League. They knew that the
United States now had a good navy and were convinced
that the development of the commercial empire, especially
in the Caribbean and the Far East, could be more effectively
managed if they were free from formal international
scrutiny and control. On the other hand, the Democrats
had repeatedly condemned imperialism. President Wilson
had denounced it in strong language and frankly offered
the League as a kind of remedy for the wars in which
commercial rivalry had so often involved the great powers.
With the issues fairly joined, the Democrats went down to
the most terrible defeat ever suffered in the long history of
their party.

Before President Harding had gone very far on the way
back to normalcy, death cut short his career, leaving his
high office to the Vice-President, Calvin Coolidge, of
Webster's state, a competent political leader even more
determined, if possible, to effect the restoration which his
predecessor craved. ... Nominated for the Presidency
by the Republicans in 1924, Coolidge easily overcame
John W. Davis, the Democratic candidate, and Robert M.
La Follette, the candidate of independent progressives and
socialists. ...

Concerning the significance of this triumph there could
be no doubt. The philosophy of Coolidge was well known.
He had once said emphatically that "the driving force of
American progress has been her industries. They have
created the wealth that has wrought our national development.
... Without them the great force of agriculture
would now be where it was in the eighteenth century."
Nor was there any confusion in his concept of the party
alignment. He regarded himself as the heir of William
McKinley, and McKinley, he said, had taken up "the work
of Hamilton and Clay ... reëstablished their principles."

During the years of Republican administration under
Harding and Coolidge, long-standing policies of the party
were put into effect:

1. In harmony with the doctrines of Hamilton, Webster,
   and McKinley, the Republicans raised the protective tariff
   which the Democrats had reduced under the leadership of
   Wilson.
2. Although President Wilson had kept the Federal Reserve Bank out of the hands of Bryan agrarians, its administration was not quite to the liking of his successor.
   Under Harding, the high control was moved over to the
   right --- so far in fact that the left-wing Republicans insisted
   on having a "dirt farmer" added to the Board in Washington.
3. Roosevelt had given pain to the conservative wing of
   his party by appointing Oliver Wendell Holmes to the
   Supreme Court and Wilson had positively scandalized the
   same group by selecting Louis D. Brandeis for that high
   tribunal. Though these liberals were somewhat offset by
   appointments of another kind, their dissenting opinions on
   occasion were not pleasing to the normalists. Hence, under
   the renewed Republican régime, William Howard Taft,
   whose conservative political views were well known, was
   elevated to the post of Chief Justice, and other selections
   were made from the same school. Very soon jurisprudence
   registered a turn in the direction of Marshall's Federalism.
4. For businessmen eager to develop the natural resources of the country, the Harding administration made
   the way smooth by a leasing policy none too strict in its
   terms. In fact, in this connection there occurred certain
   scandals which recalled the misadventures of the Grant
   administration some fifty years before.
5. Income, excess profit, and inheritance taxes were materially reduced, particularly with reference to the heaviest
   burden bearers.
6. Foreign commerce was promoted with all the engines
   of the federal government, the Secretary of Commerce,
   Herbert Hoover, taking the active lead in this operation,
   with the general support of the State and Navy Departments. In 1928, a carefully conceived scheme for subsidizing the merchant marine was embodied in the JonesWhite Act.
7. The commercial empire was renewed in spirit. In the
   Philippines the strong hand was restored. Firm warnings
   were issued to Japan, calling attention to American interests in China and indicating that trespasses would not be
   permitted.
8. As a corollary, perhaps, of foreign and imperial policies, the League of Nations was utterly rejected by the
   Republican administration and direct support was given
   to the advance guard of American businessmen wherever
   engaged on the frontiers of enterprise.

Beyond cavil, the return to normalcy brought with it
prosperity to the industrial world. But ... farmers and
cotton planters ... received low prices for their produce,
suffered from a heavy burden of debts, and eagerly pressed
for relief at the hands of Congress.

As of yore, agrarian discontent appeared in the left wing
of the Republican party --- the party formed by the union of
industrialists and farmers at Chicago in 1860. Indeed, as
the Democratic party became more urban in tone and
direction, the Republican agricultural group steadily developed
in strength. ...

As time passed, three features of the century-old contest
between agriculture and capitalism became increasingly
evident. First of all, the gravity of the agricultural problem
was now dimly appreciated in circles accustomed to crying
down the farmers as "crazy populists." Since tenancy
was rising, the question was asked by responsible statesmen:
"Are American farmers to sink down into a semiservile
condition akin to that of the Roman coloni? If so,
what bearing does this have on the future of American
civilization?" Even manufacturers, alarmed at the development
of foreign competition under the direction of American
investment bankers, began to take a more serious
interest in the fate of their best customers --- the farmers.

In the second place, the farmers were no longer content
with classical remedies for agrarian distress, such as
currency inflation. They now demanded a kind of socialization
of their industry, with government assistance, and the
fixing of prices by elaborate agencies. ... As stanch individualists,
farmers could never effect by private arrangement
an organization comparable to that brought about
among capitalists and fix their prices at dinner conferences.
Hence they demanded that the government undertake the
task. Moreover, the experiment was to be expensive, not as
costly as the additions to the navy made necessary by the
commercial empire, but still very costly, entailing perhaps
a long continuance of income and inheritance taxes.

In the third place, the agrarian group now had leaders
quite different from Bryan of 1896--- men like Frank O.
Lowden, for example, who besides being capitalists in their
own right, stood firmly on the contention that the future
of America was really at stake, that the fundamental question
of maintaining a balanced economy of manufacturing
and farming was actually involved, and that a decision in
favor of unfettered capitalism would be ruinous in its
consequences. ... But in 1928 the Republican and Democratic
parties both refused to take the drastic steps demanded
by the agrarians; the age of Jackson and Bryan
had come to a close.

### By Way of Summary

Reviewing this long political conflict certain conclusions
seem to emerge.

Political Federalism of the Hamilton type has practically
disappeared. No responsible statesman now speaks of the
masses in the fearsome and contemptuous language used
by eighteenth-century leaders, such, for example, as John
Adams and Gouverneur Morris. The idea of giving property
a strategic frontier by qualifications on the right to
vote and hold office is no longer ardently championed.
Political democracy, subject to some limitations, has become
accepted. ...

Economic federalism of the Hamilton type ... has
continued steadily to the present time. It was and is
primarily the working philosophy of business enterprise. It
holds that the wealth, the comfort, and the mechanical,
scientific, and commercial advance of America are essentially
due to business enterprise and that the policies of
government associated with it are necessary to its operations
and expansion. In an unbroken line, the economic
principles of Hamilton were carried forward by Webster,
Lincoln, McKinley, and Coolidge. The only noteworthy
departure in appeal during the nineteenth century was the
open partnership made with the Western farmers in 1860,
which gave the party of Hamilton a strange agrarian tinge,
particularly in times of distress in the wheat and corn belts.

On the other side has been the frank alignment of agricultural
interests made by Jefferson, continued by Jackson
(who added an army of mechanics), solidified by the slaveowning
planters, and marshaled anew by Bryan after division
in the Civil War. In this party also, except when it
swung too violently to the left, were to be found many
importing merchants and other capitalists (with their professional
associates) whose undertakings were injured or at
least not benefited by Federalist--Whig--Republican adventures
in political economy. As time went on and the country
became increasingly industrial and urban, the capitalistic
wing of the Democratic party acquired a power fairly
proportioned to its economic strength. ...

To some extent, it is evident from the story, the long
political battle has involved the distribution of wealth
directly. It is true that the party of Hamilton, Webster,
McKinley, and Coolidge never admitted that it was attempting
to divert goods from the agricultural to the industrial
class. ... But the leaders of the Republican
party have more than once asserted that the left-wing
agrarians were "assaulting accumulated wealth" --- bluntly
attempting to take goods from the rich --- by currency,
banking, and taxing measures.

The latter, the agrarians, have been equally sure that the
Hamilton--Webster--McKinley--Coolidge wing has been engaged
in enriching capitalistic classes at the expense of the
masses. They have often been frank in declaring their
purpose to make a diversion of wealth to their side by
currency, banking, and taxing measures.

Whatever the truth in the case as far as economic substance
is concerned, in fact leaders in both historic parties
have believed that their operations involved a contest over
the distribution of goods, sometimes subtle, sometimes
crude, but always very real in character. In politics it is
beliefs that count. In that great game, opinion and conflict
have evolved together. It is impossible to discover to what
extent the one is due to the other, although we may suspect
with the poet that in the beginning was the deed.

Among the instrumentalities employed by the two parties
in this contest over the distribution of wealth, the tariff,
currency, banking, and taxation have been constant factors
from the beginning. As time has gone on, however, the
conflict has become more complex. Today the agrarian interests
have abandoned currency inflation as a method of
farm relief and, like the capitalists, are demanding positive
measures of government intervention calculated to raise
the prices of their products, that is, to affect the distribution
of wealth by political action.

When charged with abandoning the ancient creed promulgated
by Jefferson respecting "the less government the
better," the agrarians either ignore the indictment or point
out the forms of government intervention employed by
industrialists to keep up the prices of manufactured goods.
Discrimination in this relation is difficult.

If either party to the struggle has ever sacrificed a substantial
interest to consistency in political theory, history
gives no record. Democrats, in 1850, were willing to make
a drastic use of government engines to secure the return of
property in runaway slaves. Forty years later Republicans,
who had professed a liberal view of the Constitution with
respect to the things they favored, vigorously denounced
the income tax as a violation of that fundamental law, even
though a similar tax had been imposed by a Republican
administration to finance its war for the Union. At the
opening of the new century, President Coolidge, heir to
Federalist traditions, finding Congress inclined to make
experiments in social legislation for ends not like those of
protective tariffs, made strong speeches on behalf of
"states' rights."

Surely no one who has examined the relation of constitutional
and political theory to practical ends or observed
the use of it by both parties can conclude that it is a
determining factor in driving men into one party or the
other. Indeed this type of speculation, if examined closely,
looks more akin to protective coloration than to causation.
A similar conclusion has been reached by some historians
after studying the evolution of theory respecting the
judiciary. When the Jeffersonian Republicans were being
baffled by the decisions of the Federalist Chief Justice,
John Marshall, they were highly critical in their attitude
toward the federal judiciary. When the same Supreme
Court, under the direction of a Democratic Justice, Roger
B. Taney, upheld slavery in two ringing decisions, Jeffersonian
Democrats, then led by planters, called for loyalty,
and criticism came from the other side of the line. Within
forty years the tables were reversed and Democrats were
assailing the judiciary for its income tax and labor opinions.
Still, on the whole, it must be said that the HamiltonWebster-McKinley-Coolidge
party has maintained a more
friendly attitude toward the federal judiciary and has had
good reasons for so doing.

Now we come to expansion and commercial empire. Jefferson's
agricultural party has been fairly consistent in its
attitude toward the acquisition of land --- for the use of
planters and farmers. There is not much mystery about
this. Under the auspices of that party, Louisiana was purchased,
Florida acquired, Texas annexed, and an empire
wrested from Mexico. In waging war on the imperialism
of the McKinley epoch, the Democrats made it clear that
they did not object to expansion provided it took in desirable
territory and people "willing and fit to become
American citizens." On the other side, the Federalists
generally opposed western expansion on the ground that
it would enable the farming population to overbalance, that
is, outvote the commercial sections.

With equal attention to substantial matters, the Federalist-Whig-Republican
party supported commercial empire,
first by legislation, then by active naval interposition, and
finally by war. It was under the auspices of this party that
favors and bounties were given to shipping, formal relations
with China were begun, Japan was opened, Hawaii
acquired, and Porto Rico, Guam, the Philippines, and
other territories added to the American heritage. Opposition
to such enterprises, such as it was, came mainly from
the agrarian party.

In this conflict between agriculture and capitalism,
which has been at the heart of the American party battle,
is to be found some clue, at least, to the existence of two
parties in the United States as distinguished from the
multiple-party system of Europe. American society has
been simpler from the beginning than European society.
There have been here no racial minorities with historic
roots and special territorial interests, such as once furnished
the Polish party for Germany and now supplies the
Alsatian party for France. The army of the United States
has been small, for obvious reasons, and has never constituted
a great separate class in the American social system.
The various churches, while undoubtedly powerful in
influence, have never possessed large landed property or
high offices in the state. Hence there has been no practical
nutriment for clerical and anti-clerical parties. So the conflict
between agriculture and capitalism has not been confused
by collateral issues. Moreover the size of party
machines and the expense of maintaining them work
against the rise of small parties in the United States. It is
usually easier for a person with a new idea --- if it is not too
radical --- to get a hearing in one of the major parties than
to attract a following by pursuing an independent course
of action.

### Where are We Going?

At the end of such speculations one cannot help asking:
"To what extent have the political parties controlled the
development of the country and to what extent have they
merely reflected movements and groupings derived from
economic activities of the people?" This is an old question.
A similar problem puzzled the Greeks and nobody has ever
been able to solve it.

Two or three times in the history of the United States,
political decisions, seemingly momentous in consequence,
have been made. One was in 1787--88 when the federal
Constitution was adopted, giving an immense impetus to
business enterprise. Another was in 1800 when the agricultural
party was put into power and proceeded to acquire
all the land between the Mississippi River and the Pacific.
A third was in 1860 when, as a result of the election of
Lincoln, the planters were unhorsed and subjugated to
businessmen and farmers.

From all this we may conclude that politics is not mere
sound and fury, a futile, game in which the prime consideration
is to get the right man and the right slogan. Certainly
from the beginning to the end, economic realities as substantial
as capitalism and agriculture have been behind the
party battle. It can hardly be denied that the center of
gravity in accumulated capital has been on the HamiltonWebster-McKinley-Coolidge
side of the contest, although
it has been strongly supported by freehold farmers, north
and west, since the formation of the union of hearts at
Chicago in 1860 on the basis of reciprocal concessions.
Neither can it be denied that the Jefferson--Jackson--Bryan
array was essentially agrarian in its economic philosophy
and practical measures --- with an active mechanic-labor
wing after the upheaval of 1828.

But it is difficult to believe that the election of Blaine
instead of Cleveland in 1884 or Parker instead of Roosevelt
in 1904 would have made much difference in the
economy, social life, or general culture of the American
people. Indeed, it may be said that, given a vigorous, ingenious
race endowed with marvelous natural resources,
the final triumph of business enterprise was as inevitable
as the movement of the suns. As far as the great body of
social legislation enacted during the last thirty years is
concerned, it must be confessed that it sprang from movements
of opinion quite outside the range of political orthodoxy,
that is, from the agitations of minorities winning
concessions from the major parties.

To some extent, certainly, the conflict between these two
parties has been an emotional antagonism arising from
divergent economic situations. The same violent outbursts
of temper have appeared on both sides --- the superior
education of the rich making little impression on the verbal
patterns employed to express their passions. Yet to some
extent also, the party antagonism has been due to a difference
of opinion with respect to the values of agriculture
and capitalism.

Jefferson certainly had a very clear-cut ideal for the nation
--- one thoroughly "reasoned" although perhaps the
materialist might wish to point out that it was an agriculturalist's
praise of agriculture. But it was not a slave
owner's concept, and Jefferson was a slave owner. On the
contrary, it was a freeholder's ideal. The Republic of which
Jefferson dreamed was to be composed principally of freehold
farmers owning the soil they tilled. There were to be
towns and villages, of course, but they were to be small
and their prime function was to supply the wants of farmers.
Great cities of capitalists and "mobs" of artisans were
to be avoided like poison; factories were to be kept in
Europe. A complete system of education from the primary
school to the university was to open careers to talent, to
furnish abilities for the state, and to promote culture for
society. A simple government, inexpensive to operate, owing
its authority to popular majorities, was to maintain
order and defend the heritage. Peace with all mankind was
to be a fixed policy, so that this Utopia might be continued
indefinitely.

Whether this dream could have been realized, if Jefferson's
party had labored at the task night and day with all
the engines of government in their hands, affords an interesting,
perhaps a melancholy, subject for speculation. But
all members of Jefferson's party did not always labor
under the spell of this fixed vision. Neither did Jefferson
as a practical politician. Yet to a certain extent it was
realized, more on account of the immense area of free land
available than on account of the political measures adopted
by Democratic administrations.

Nevertheless, it is no longer the dream of the Democratic
party with its huge urban membership. In fact, with
the growth of the industrial population, the center of
gravity in the Democratic party is passing, has already
passed, from the open country to the cities. The mechanical
wing, originally annexed by Jackson, probably outnumbers
the freehold section, and there are enough capitalists not
engaged in protected industries to furnish the sinews of
war for a considerable party campaign. For example, from
the public utilities operating in cities controlled by the
Democrats handsome contributions and inside tips for
political managers are available to promote candidacies
and party enterprises. Contracts and public works likewise
yield magnificent political returns. On the other hand, the
power of the cotton planters sinks relatively in the scale.
Chained to the Democratic party by their antagonism to
the Negro, they cannot force concessions by threats of
desertion and retaliation.

It is perhaps no exaggeration to say that the Democratic
party, founded by Jefferson to represent the agricultural
interest, has become the organ of "the mobs of the great
cities" which he feared and despised, thus to a large extent
the organ of industrial masses of alien origin or immediate
alien descent. As the party accustomed to pummeling the
people of "wealth and talents," the Democrats also draw
to their ranks recruits from the lower middle classes. Indeed,
if the statement of the party ideal made by President
Wilson in The New Freedom is authoritative, utopia is the
land which offers abundant opportunity for the poor boy
to rise into the heaven of the middle class by building "a
small but independent business" of his own. ...

On the other side of the battle-line, the utopia to be won
by political action has never been so perfectly sketched by
leading participants. Hamilton's ideal, no doubt, was a society
in which the rich and well-born governed without any
questions from below, industries flourished, and the poor,
though compelled to work, were not unprosperous. During
the middle period, Hamilton's spiritual heirs spoke of developing
manufacturing to such a point that it would
supply an adequate market for farm produce.

McKinley did not go far beyond this concept in choosing
the full dinner pail for his symbol. None of the men busily
engaged in promoting machine industry seem to have conceived
of the day when capitalism would be dominant beyond
all dispute, when three-fourths or nine-tenths of the
people would be dwellers in cities, when the export of
manufactured commodities would be deemed vital to our
very existence, when the United States would be the first
naval power in the world, when the members of the industrial
army would outnumber freehold farmers five or
six to one.

At all events, few of them took the trouble to work out
any kind of ideal goal for machine industry, offering peace
and security to labor such as Jefferson conceived for the
farmer. The nearest attempt on that side was, perhaps, the
Progressive platform of 1912, which indeed summed up
all the newer social tendencies of the age. Only socialists
have taken the philosophy of the machine at face value and
dreamed of carrying manufacturing economy over into a
sort of utopia for the industrial masses.

It is doubtless for this reason that individualists of the
Democratic school are wont to speak of Socialists and
masters of business enterprise as "allies" --- unwitting allies
perhaps --- in destroying the heritage handed down from
the days of Jefferson. But this is all speculation and falls
outside the province of history.
