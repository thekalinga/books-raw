## Twenty-Eight Years of the Jeffersonian Party[^/195]

For twenty-eight years, from 1801 to 1829, Presidents
calling themselves Republican occupied the White House ---
Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and John Quincy Adams ---
and except for a short time at the beginning they were well
supported in Congress by party members of their own
persuasion. During this period, the Federalist party, as a
national organization, died a lingering death. It continued
to put up candidates until 1816, but after that failure it
disappeared from the national theater. Deprived of a shelter
all their own, active Federalists then went into the Republican
organization and did what they could to bend it
in their direction, while the intransigents of the old generation
often sulked in their tents, lamenting the evil days
upon which they had fallen.

Although they possessed the power of government, the
Republicans, it must be said, did not have a perfectly free
hand in carrying their policies into effect. For more than
half of this period, the nations of Europe were engaged in
the devastating Napoleonic wars which interfered with the
shipment of American agricultural produce to Europe, and
for a brief time the United States was at war with Great
Britain. Owing to foreign events beyond their control, the
Republicans were compelled to adopt many devices not to
their liking, or at least contrary to their professions.

### Republican Economic Measures

Nothing had caused more discussion among the Republicans
than the national debt. Members of the extreme
left had argued that it should be repudiated, that inasmuch
as soldiers had given their lives to the Revolutionary cause
property owners should sacrifice their financial contributions.
Not many, of course, held this extreme opinion, but
some did, and the Federalists had attributed such views to
the Republicans in general. A middle faction of Republicans
opposed repudiation but thought that some reduction
should be made in the generous terms adopted by Hamilton.
All Republicans agreed that, in any case, the debt was
a burden on the taxpayers, most of whom were farmers,
that it was a source of speculation and corruption in Congress,
and that it should be discharged in full as soon as
possible.

Hence the Republicans paid off the national debt as fast
as they could, and they were in a fair way to extinguish it
when they got into a war with Great Britain in 1812 and
were simply forced to increase it.

Hamilton's second great political institution, the United
States Bank, likewise came in for its full share of Republican
attack. On this point there was no compromise. In
1811, at the end of the twenty-year term, the charter of
the Bank expired, and the Republicans refused to renew
the life of the great "money power." The banking business
passed into the hands of banks chartered by the states and
the paper notes of these concerns flooded the country,
some of them good, many of them bad.

If it had not been for a crisis, the Republicans probably
would have stood firmly against any revival of the United
States Bank. But during the war with Great Britain, which
they undertook against the wishes of the business and commercial
sections, they were driven into a corner in their
efforts to pay their bills. In the end, they had to choose
between surrendering to the private banks, which had
sprung up in the business centers such as Boston, New
York, and Philadelphia, and establishing a semi-political
government bank under their own control. In the dilemma,
they naturally chose the latter plan; in 1816 a Republican
Congress chartered the second United States Bank and a
Republican President approved it. Members on the left
wing opposed this action and in growing numbers waged
war on the new "money power." As we shall see, they split
the party and destroyed the Bank. Even members of the
middle and right factions accepted the Bank as a measure
of necessity merely to save the government in their hands
from a worse fate.

Into the tax program of the Republicans, the War of
1812 broke with incredible force. They had bitterly opposed
the Federalists' direct taxes, which fell heavily upon
land, and their internal taxes, especially the tax on whisky
which reached into the pockets of thousands of farmers
who had little stills of their own. Once installed in office,
the Republicans reduced and abolished until they cut the
direct and internal revenue taxes and duties down almost to
the vanishing point. These burdens so odious to agriculture
had nearly disappeared when several of them had to be
revived after war was declared on Great Britain. Wars cost
money and somebody must pay for them! Yet it could be
truly said that, until necessity compelled them to choose
another course, the Republican statesmen had done their
best to ease the taxes distasteful to their agricultural constituents.

Tariff schedules likewise became involved in war necessities.
Those established under Federalist auspices were
mildly protectionist in character. Hamilton's thoroughgoing
program had been rejected by Congress. As the rates
which the Republicans found in force on coming into
office were light and yielded large revenues to pay off the
hated debt, no radical changes were made in a downward
direction.

On the contrary, the opposite happened. The wars in
Europe, the War of 1812, the blockades, and the depredations
played havoc with American farmers and planters.
Unable to ship their produce abroad freely, they found it
spoiling on their hands or sinking in price for the want of
a market. Why not have a home market, therefore, beyond
the reach of wars? Manufacturers approved the idea and
offered to furnish the market for the produce of farms and
plantations if they could get sufficient protection against
foreign competition.

Despite loud protests on the left wing, the Republicans
adopted in 1816 a protective tariff bill which would have
delighted Hamilton had he been alive to see it. In a long
oration, John C. Calhoun, a South Carolina planter, defended
the bill in Congress on the ground that it would
furnish a market for the produce of the soil. And the
stoutest opposition came from New England whose shipping
interests, engaged in a lucrative carrying trade, did
not want foreign imports reduced by high tariffs. The business
was economic but tables were reversed. As we shall
see, when conditions changed, planters and farmers could
alter their tariff policies. At no time did they forget to
cherish the land.

Land --- the source of Jefferson's party interest-also figured
in two other strokes of policy made by the Republicans
during this period. In 1803 they purchased the Louisiana
Territory from Napoleon and thus added enough
land to satisfy, it seemed, farmers and planters for a century
or more. True to their class, the financial and commercial
Federalists on the seaboard opposed the purchase
on the ground that it would soon enable the agricultural
interests of the South and West to dominate the country.
That dominance was exactly what the Republicans wanted
and, as they had a majority in Congress, the treaty of
purchase was ratified.

The question of land similarly entered the War of 1812.
According to the usual schoolbook traditions, this war was
fought in defense of American rights against British depredations
on the sea, but Professor Julius W. Pratt, in his
Expansionists of 1812, has demolished that theory. Commercial
interests were generally opposed to the war. Planters
and farmers voted for it. The grand outcome was to be the
annexation of the two Floridas for the planters and the
annexation of Canada for the farmers. In the process,
the Indian allies of Great Britain on the frontier were to be
reduced to order so that pioneers could take up their abode
in peace on the edges of American civilization. Owing to
inadequate military preparations the plans failed.

The truth is that the Republicans did not believe in a
powerful navy and a powerful standing army. In Jefferson's
eyes, a navy was a costly Federalist device for which
farmers and planters had to pay in taxes simply to protect
the property of American shippers on the high seas.

Loyal to farmer traditions, Jefferson feared a strong
regular army. It was expensive, he thought, and unnecessary
because the popular militia could be relied upon to
keep order and defend the country. Although Jefferson
used the navy with vigor and telling effect on the Barbary
pirates, he and his party reduced rather than strengthened
the regular armed forces of the country. The failure to
achieve their ends in the War of 1812 may be laid at their
door. Farmers did not realize that banking and fighting
were professions that could not be learned overnight.

On the whole, it could be said that the Republicans were
loyal to the landed interest which they frankly championed
in politics. Most of their apparent veerings in the Federalist
direction were due to that loyalty rather than to any
conversion of heart. ...
