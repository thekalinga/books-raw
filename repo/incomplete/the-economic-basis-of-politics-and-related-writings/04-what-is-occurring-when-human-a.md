## What Is Occurring When Human Affairs Are Being Discussed?[^/20]

Committing ourselves to a simple or common sense
realism, we inquire: What is occurring when human affairs
are being discussed? And we answer provisionally:
Whatever else may be involved, six features enter into
consideration.

In the first place some person or persons are engaged in
speaking or writing or making symbols of one kind or
another. ... But few essays, editorials, orations, dissertations,
and serious volumes open with the confession: "I
am speaking, in fact, making a statement of the things
which I have found true, or of good report, and worthy of
discussion."

For various reasons the confession is avoided. Obvious
as the fact is, it sounds conceited. Humility, true or mock,
suggests the impersonal, the avoidance of the ego. Was it
not once the sport of critics to count the number of times
the pronoun "I" occurs in Theodore Roosevelt's papers and
messages, and employ the result in ridiculing the author?
Yet, after all, those papers and messages were Theodore
Roosevelt's papers and messages. No one claimed that
God or Nature wrote them. The constant use of the "I"
added nothing to the truth, falsity, value, or utility of the
facts and ideas contained in them. ...

It is not probable ... that there will be any material
change in the dislike of the writings liberally sprinkled
with "I's." Nor would there be any advantage in the universal
use of the first person singular, beyond emphasizing
the fact that in every discussion some "I" is speaking,[^/21]
and thus putting readers or participants on their guard
against cloaked pretensions to omniscience and infallible
authority.

[^/20]: From The Discussion of Human Affairs, The Macmillan
Co. (1936).

In cold truth impersonal discourse, as perhaps in the
case of Cæsar, may represent the puffed-up conceit of
false humility. It may be a mere subterfuge, designed to
give weight or compulsion to statements that would seem
negligible if made on mere personal authority. ...

Although there is no way of knowing, the avoidance of
the confessional style and the resort to the impersonal are
doubtless due to another temper rather than that of
humility, true or false. Human beings seem to be so constituted
that they love to speak with an authority not their
own --- the authority of God, Nature, Science, the System,
or some other absolute. Authority is often an effective
instrument for stopping the mouths and filling the ears of
opponents.

After all, if it is a case of "I" against "I," what chance
does the expositor have against an opposition possessing a
majority? Besides, who is he to set himself up, to mount
his pulpit, or thump his tub? Only by clothing himself in
the garment of impersonal power can he hope to attain
weight in the councils of discussion. ...

Not only is some person speaking. Every discussion is
occurring at a given period in time ... And at each
given period the ideas in circulation and the interests prevailing
are marked by certain characteristics that have
features of uniqueness. As we say, they "belong to the
age."

Since this seems to be true, each person taking part in
a discussion reflects in some manner ideas and interests
uppermost in his time, and they are ever-changing ideas
and interests, however strong the perdurance of formalities.
No doubt, many who discourse on human affairs seek to be
"timeless," but few if any attain that "perfection of wisdom."
All discussions are timed and dated. This would
appear to be an obvious maxim of common sense.

[^/21]: Compiler's note: For an account of the "I" that was
finding expression when Beard wrote, see the Introduction to
the present volume.

The person. The time. The discussion of human affairs
always occurs at some place --- Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago,
London, Berlin, Prague, Belgrade. Ideas may be gathered
from the literature and practices of the wide earth, and
sent forth broadcast by modern agencies of dissemination.
But each participant in a discussion is at the moment in
some place.

The place, of course, is not a mere geographical spot. It
is a point in a particular social and traditional milieu, with
its own peculiarities, loyalties, interests, and values.
Though the time may be the same in many widely separated
places, the ideas and interests are divergent. This,
too, is obvious. Yet who is willing to confess: "It is I
speaking, at this fleeting moment, in this place with its
intellectual and social peculiarities"?

This is a dreadful thought. It places man far below the
angels. He speaks or writes at a time and at a place-a
fleeting moment \[in\] a small corner of the great earth. No
wonder that he resorts to God, Nature, Science, the System,
or some other universal, toward which his aspirations
reach.

... Usually the discussion is directed to some end or
purpose. Possible ends are numerous. The purpose may be
to earn a penny a line or the fee paid by the auditors. It
may be to amuse, entertain, convince, confirm, convert.
It may be to prevent impending change, to promote
change, to effect a compromise between the past and the
future, to do good, to wreak vengeance, to discomfit an
opponent. ... That end may not be openly avowed,
consciously clarified and rationalized, but it is present,
giving some direction to discussion.

... Do not speakers on the right discount opinions
tendered by labor leaders and socialists, as anchored in
their prejudices? Do not speakers on the left discount
opinions tendered by "capitalist" speakers, as anchored
in their prejudices?

For such queries there is good reason. It is possible for
any competent historian familiar with the forms, phrases,
and creeds of groups, classes, and organizations to classify
them into types that appear with almost wearisome reiteration.
Such a historian can predict, with a high degree
of certainty, the formulas, slogans, clichés, and positions
that will be disclosed by the editors of the New York
Tribune, and the editors of the Daily Worker, for example,
when some strikers are shot or beaten in a labor disturbance.

Indeed many of the formulas used by writers and
speakers are so well worn and so well known that they
are like ancient and familiar songs which can be sung to
a harp. The moment the name of the speaker or writer is
announced, the general tenor of the tune can be guessed
with a high degree of assurance. The moment the first
notes of the tune are heard, the singer can be placed in
his category of social affiliation with a considerable amount
of assurance.

The person. The time. The place. The purpose. The
fifth feature of discussion is the preliminary assumptions.
All discussion of human affairs proceeds upon some assumption
or assumptions respecting the nature of things or
upon the assumption that no assumption has been made.
An assumption, like a purpose, may be sublimated, hidden
in the subconscious self, or open, avowed, clarified,
and confessed.

Ordinarily we are controlled by what John R. Commons
calls our "habitual assumptions." They are made up of our
early ideas hardened into dogmas, our customary mores
rationalized, our cosmogonies and cosmologies acquired
in childhood, or/and our more or less consciously explored
acceptances.

The existence of preliminary assumptions may be denied;
indeed, is hotly denied by many persons who claim
to discuss human affairs "scientifically." They pretend to
assume nothing, to take nothing for granted, not even
private property, sex, qualities of human nature, and many
other considerations that enter into discussion. But unless
some things are taken for granted, assumed, and some
common principles are accepted, discussion cannot proceed
at all.

Moreover common sense reveals man to himself as a
bundle of habitual assumptions, of things he takes for
granted when he begins to discourse on human affairs.
He cannot think of his mind as a bottomless pit, containing
nothing, out of which come timeless, placeless,
purposeless words beyond his control. Before a person is
old enough to enter into discussions, his mind has some
things in it. And among them is a great collection of ideas
taken for granted, seldom if ever re-examined, and never
to be explored into that dark ultimate beyond his grasp.

The person. The time. The place. The purpose. The
preliminary assumptions. These enter into all discussions of
human affairs. It seems impossible to conceive of any discussion
without these features.

A sixth feature is the form of statement. Analyzed down
to its irreducible elements every statement respecting human
affairs asserts facts or opinions or both.
