## America and the Balance of Power[^/257]

\[Compiler's note: In the lecture presented in this chapter,
printed in 1922, Beard said "the menaces that confront the
United States today are not European. As President Harding
has said, they are in the Pacific ... we want markets
in China in which to sell goods ... that means intense
and active rivalry with England, France, and Japan in
the Far East." In February, 1935, Scribner's Magazine
carried a statement by Beard that: "Confronted by the
difficulties of a deepening domestic crisis and by the comparative
ease of a foreign war, what will President Roosevelt
do? Judging by the past history of American politicians,
he will choose the latter, or, perhaps it would be
more accurate to say, amid powerful conflicting emotions
he will 'stumble into' the latter. The Jeffersonian \[now
Democratic\] party gave the nation the War of 1812, the
Mexican War, and its participation in the World War. The
Pacific war awaits."

Two years later, Japan began an invasion of the Chinese
mainland and proceeded to restrict the commercial activities
of Americans in the area. On November 26, 1941,
after a secret understanding with the British, the United
States government plunged into a touchy situation by
officially calling upon Japan to withdraw "all military,
naval, air and police forces from China and from Indochina"
and to respect the open-door program, thereby giving
American businessmen access once more to the trade
of China's teeming millions. To have complied would have
meant the abrupt reversal of the whole direction of Japanese
economic imperialism, which was then trying to
"solve" the problems of overcrowded islands at home by
bursting forth on the great `plains of Asia. A few days
later, as is a matter of common knowledge, the Japanese,
instead of retiring quietly to their homeland, opened fire
on American installations at Pearl Harbor. Under the
terms of the Axis agreement for mutual security, this act
of war soon carried Germany and Italy into formal armed
conflict with the United States.

Co. (1922).

Given this sequence, Beard's analysis of the economic
aspects of American imperialism in the Orient, and its
potential outcome, as phrased in 1922, should be of considerable
retrospective interest.\]

"In the beginning was the deed," wrote the wise poet.
Activity yet remains the essential thing in the life of mankind.
Political speeches, addresses on foreign policies, and
Fourth of July orations exert little influence on the course
of human affairs, save occasionally in time of a crisis when
the spoken word indicates a line of action to be followed.
The fate of a nation --- its destiny --- lies not in words but in
deeds. The nation lives by work, not by rhetoric. It is no
detraction from the high honor rightly ascribed to the
Fathers of this Republic to say that, well as they built, they
alone did not make America. Our America was made by
the pioneers, men and women, who leveled the forests, laid
out the roads, tilled the fields, and carried American life to
the Pacific, and by the capitalists and laborers who constructed
and operated the steel mills with their roaring
furnaces and the spinning mills with their flying spindles.
I do not mean to say that concepts of life and duty do not
underlie this fabric of human endeavor, but merely that
the majestic signs of power are the outcome of activity.

So, whoever fain would divine the fate of a nation must
ponder deeply its activity. It is not what we say about the
sea that counts; it is what our sailors do upon the seas. It
is not our academic theories about finance that carry
weight in the councils of nations; it is our dollars and our
cents that imperatively command the attention and wholesome
respect of those engaged in the counting houses of
the earth's great cities. It is not what President Harding
thinks about China or what John Hay has written about
China that will shape the coming fateful years in the
Pacific; it is what our merchants, our capitalists, our railway
builders, and our moneylenders do in China that will
set the problem for the rising generation.

Now America is primarily an industrial and a trading
nation. Its prime activities are connected with the production
and sale of goods. It has no landed nobility to cultivate
the graces of leisure. It has no military aristocracy devoted
to the exercise of arms. Napoleon once sneered at the
nation of shopkeepers, but it was the sneer of jealousy,
and the Anglo-Saxon is proud of the term of contempt thus
flung at him. Whether this pride is warranted or not,
whether the virtues of trade --- those bourgeois virtues so
scorned of the emancipated --- are really virtues, is a matter
for the theologian and the ethical teacher. The fact remains.
America is an industrial and trading nation. Our
activities at home and abroad are mainly related to these
essential elements in our national life. Here then is the
key to our domestic history and to our future foreign
policies. Our empire of trade extends to the four corners
of the world. It stretches out under many flags and many
governments. Those working at its periphery, under the
pressure of economic laws, make the conditions with which
American foreign policy must deal. They create the stern
and solemn facts with which statesmen and politicians
must reckon.

Moreover, recent circumstances have given a new turn
to the significance of business. Many nations of antiquity
in the course of their history came to rely upon the food
supplies brought from distant lands. Rome in her imperial
days was fed by wheat carried from her uttermost provinces;
when this supply was cut off and the fields of Italy
failed to make good the shortage, the staff of life failed.
The new nations and new states that rose upon the foundations
of Rome were almost self-sufficing. At all events they
could feed their population by food grown within their
own borders. With the advent of the machine age, this
fortunate condition was lost by the leaders in invention
and manufacture. In 1914 neither England nor Germany
could maintain a standard of living for the laboring population
without drawing heavily upon the granaries of
America and Russia. The huge populations, called into
being by the opportunities of industry, constituted a growing
pressure upon the agencies of business and of government,
compelling them to extend and maintain foreign
markets. This naturally drove the seekers for markets into
the backward places of the earth where industry had not
penetrated or had made little advance. For nearly a century
England had no formidable rival in this imperial
enterprise, then one after another competitors appeared
upon the world stage --- Germany, Japan, Italy, France, and
the United States. Even in China and India the whir of
the spindle and the clank of the loom were heard ringing
out the fate of Lancashire cotton mills. Here were the roots
of imperialism, armaments, and warfare. Those who asked
where this all would finally lead and what would be the
outcome when every nation became industrial were silenced
by the inexorable demands of current business.
After us the deluge!

In this swiftly drifting world economy, the United States
occupies a peculiar position. From one point of view it is
very fortunate. It can feed its immense population with
almost every kind of product from oranges and sugar to
wheat and bacon. It can clothe its people with the cotton
of the South and, did exigencies again demand, with wool
from the sheep ranges. Considered abstractly it could be
a self-sufficing nation. But considered practically, it is, as
things now stand, dependent upon foreign trade, if not for
a livelihood, at least for what is called "prosperity." It is
the city populations of England and Germany that must
have markets abroad and import food supplies. In the
United States, the wheat and corn grower of the West, the
cotton grower of the South, as well as the maker of silks in
Paterson, or the manufacturer of steel in Pittsburgh, all
depend upon foreign business for that margin of trade
which spells prosperity. In short, having an endowment of
agricultural resources beyond the strength of our domestic
markets for the produce, we must perforce sell the foreigner
foodstuffs as well as boots and clothes. Here is a
paradox which seems to have received small attention from
professional economists.

In every respect, the World War \[I\] has increased the
dependence of the United States upon world markets even
for the profitable disposal of its surplus capital. It has discharged
a very large portion of its indebtedness abroad and
has become an insistent moneylender itself. In 1915,
European capitalists held $2,704,000,000 worth of American
railway stocks and securities; two years later more
than half of these holdings had been transferred to America;
and the stream still continues to flow westward. In
1914 more than one-fourth of the stocks of the United
States Steel Corporation were held in Europe; today less
than one-tenth are in foreign hands. The crisis induced in
London, long the money center of the world, by the exigencies
of the war, led to the phenomenal rise of New
York. To sustain their credit here for huge borrowings,
England and France opened their strongboxes and sent
across the sea the very finest of their gilt-edge securities.
As a keen French economist puts it: "One fact dominates
all others: the rise of the United States to world hegemony.
Lord Robert Cecil has compared the position of the United
States after the Great War with that of Great Britain after
the Napoleonic wars. That comparison is not quite exact;
because the British hegemony was then essentially European
while that of the United States today is universal.
An immense reservoir of raw materials, of manufactured
products, and of capital, the United States has become an
economic centre and financial centre in connection with
which all the world must work and trade." Fact, stern
and tremendous, as Carlyle might say, indubitable and
fateful. Beside it all rhetoric fails. The loom on which is
woven the texture of world politics has been brought across
the sea and the picks of its flashing shuttle can be counted
in the financial columns of any great New York daily.

The United States has, therefore, entered upon the role
long played by England and France as an international
banker and money lender. The visible signs of these new
activities are the numerous American banking houses
which are to be found in the principal streets and squares
of European cities. The Morgan House and the Bankers
Trust Company look upon the monument erected to
Napoleon's glories in Place Vendôme. If you will turn to
the financial section of such a metropolitan paper as The
New York Times, you will see the statistical record of
American operations in foreign finance. Only recently the
transactions in foreign government bonds upon the Stock
Exchange have become so great as to require a separate
section of the daily statement. Often such transactions
occupy one-fourth of the space given to the day's record.
The list of bonds bought and sold on a single day is both
interesting and full of meaning. The list includes Argentine
\[Government\], Chinese Railway, City of Berne, Bordeaux,
Christiania, Copenhagen, Lyons, Marseilles, Rio de Janeiro,
Tokyo, Zürich, Danish Municipalities, Department of the
Seine, Dominican Republic, Dominion of Canada, Dutch
East Indies, French Government, Japanese Government,
Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Chile, Cuba, Uruguay,
San Paulo, Queensland, Rio Grande do Sul, Swiss Confederation,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,
Brazil, and Haiti, not to mention the defaulted securities
of Russia and Mexico. When to the sales of these government
bonds are added the transactions in the currency and
bonds of Central and Eastern European powers and the
transactions in the stocks and obligations of foreign industrial
corporations, it becomes apparent that American
investors are deeply involved in the fate of governments
and enterprises in all parts of the world. Almost every
week records the floating of a new loan to some foreign
city or country or railway already staggering under a
burden of debt. The rates are high, the commissions
enormous, and the risks correspondingly great.

In accordance with a custom, consecrated by time, the
bondholders, whenever a disturbance is threatened or a
default is at hand, look eagerly to the government at
Washington to support their interests diplomatically if
not more vigorously. The genial American public, that
takes up millions of oil stocks every year, seizes eagerly
at the opportunity to get seven and eight % on the
bonds of foreign countries, and so every new loan is received
with enthusiasm. Let this process go on for fifty
years, and the people of the United States will have reconditioned
Europe and Asia, and at the same time created
an interest obligation that will either flood our markets
with European goods by way of repayment, or raise the
dollar to a ruinous height in the exchanges of the world.
They will also have incurred a gigantic financial risk
which a new war or a social revolution in Europe would
transform into widespread ruin with its corresponding effects
on our political issues. In short, the United States,
through the investment of capital, has become a silent partner
in the fate of every established order in the world.
Unless we are to assume on the basis of the experience of
the past three hundred years that there will be no more
World Wars or social cataclysms, it is safe to conjecture
that days of greater trouble are ahead, whether we enter
the League of Nations or stay out of it. Once a great European
war merely deranged our foreign trade; in the future
it will disturb every investor in every village Main Street.
Entangling political alliances may be pieces of paper, as
the past has shown, but the texture of the economic alliance
is woven of tougher materials. Politics comes after
the fact. The gilt-edged pieces of parchment handed out to
American investors will speak louder than the silver
tongues of professional orators.

In industry, as in finance, the upward swing of the
United States after 1914 was incredible in its swiftness and
majestic in its range. Our old competitors in Europe were
not only paralyzed by war activities; they clamored louder
and louder for the products of American mills, mines, and
factories. Measured in tons of steel, pounds of copper, and
bolts of cloth, the sales of the United States abroad between
1914 and 1918 were nothing short of staggering. We
supplied not only belligerents in Europe but their former
customers in South America, Asia, and the islands of the
seas. Colossal factories sprang up on our soil. Old plants
were enlarged and extended. Thousands of new workers
were drawn into the cities from the countryside, especially
as immigration fell off. American capital was amassed in
stupendous quantities and preparations were made to
seize the empire of world trade. Having an immense home
market with the corresponding advantages of large-scale
production, American businessmen prepared to lead the
world in industry and finance. They were even able to
induce a Democratic Congress, in spite of its inveterate
suspicion, to enact the Webb law authorizing the formation
of gigantic combinations to develop and exploit foreign
markets.

In the normal course of things, if the history of England
and Germany is our guide, a merchant marine and sea
power follow the growth of foreign business. In this
sphere also the trend of American economic development
is true to form. On the eve of the World War \[I\], the
American merchant marine was an almost negligible factor
upon the high seas. It is true that long ago our wooden
ships were upon every ocean and our sailors rivaled in
skill and daring the best upon the wave; but the glory of
our enterprise upon the waters vanished during the Civil
War. After 1865 the record of nearly every year showed
a decline. In 1861 American ships brought to our shores
more than one-half, in values, of all the goods imported;
in 1913 they carried only about eleven % of the
values. Meanwhile the tonnage of ships for oceanic trade
fell from 2,547,000 to 1,928,999, reducing the United
States to a position below that of England, Germany, and
Norway. During the same period the proportion of exports
carried from our shores in American ships dropped from
seventy-two % in values to nine %. Americans,
busy with the development of their continent, and content
with their lake and coastwise trade, let foreign ships carry
their exports and imports. The planters and farmers of the
country rejected every proposal to build a merchant marine
by national subsidies --- the only device which American
capitalists could offer as a means of bringing the ocean
carrying trade into American hands.

So things stood in 1914 when the war drove the German
merchant marine from the seas and compelled the other
belligerents to commandeer ships for military purposes.
Then the United States found itself in the presence of a
crisis similar to that induced by the Napoleonic wars. One
hundred years before, cotton, tobacco, corn, and bacon
from American plantations and farms lay wasting at the
docks for want of ships to carry them abroad. In 1914 the
owners of vast masses of manufactured goods as well as
the owners of farm produce clamored for ships. Thus it
happened that the Democratic party, which many years
before had withdrawn subsidies from the American marine,
found itself confronted by a trying situation. The cry for
ships went up on every hand. It was no longer the steelmakers
and the owners of shipyards alone that were heard
in the lobbies of Congress. The munition-makers needed
ships. The farmers and planters needed them. So the Democratic
party, the party of the less government the better,
like all parties, laid aside theories in the presence of
compelling facts and set about creating an American
marine. Without utterly repudiating the teachings of half
a century, it could not openly resort to the subsidies and
bounties it had so long and so passionately denounced.
But the ships had to be built. There was another alternative.
The government itself could go into shipbuilding. In
1916, the Shipping Board was created for that purpose.
Soon the war came to America. Then with lavish grants
from the public treasury ships were built with a speed that
astonished the world.

Thanks to what appears to be a historical accident, the
United States has now become one of the great oceanic
carrying powers. In 1914 our shipyards turned out 200,000
tons of shipping while those of Great Britain turned out
1,683,000 tons. In 1918, our yards launched 3,000,000
tons while the English yards set afloat 1,348,000 tons. All
around our long coast-lines American ingenuity was applied
with astounding zeal and marvelous results. The experiment
was costly, for money was spent like water, but
"the goods were delivered." Within the course of five
years the American flag was restored to its old pre-eminence
on the high seas. In the Atlantic and the Pacific new
steamship lines made their appearance bidding for freight
and passenger business. New shipping offices were opened
in all the chief ports of the world. An ever increasing proportion
of our exports and imports was carried in American
bottoms. The steamship companies of Europe found
themselves face to face with a new and formidable competitor.
In 1920 the total number of American vessels,
registered as engaged in foreign trade and whale fishing,
showed a tonnage of 9,928,595, to say nothing of the
6,395,429 tons engaged in coastwise and internal trade.
In 1918 the entire merchant marine of the United Kingdom
amounted to 10,000,000 tons in round numbers. Thus
it happened when the war stopped that the world was
overstocked with merchant vessels and in every harbor
steamers and sailing ships lay rusting and rotting. Then
the great cry went up that the government which by
lavish expenditures had built the ships should subsidize
those into whose hands they passed at a nominal cost.
With the economics of this great transaction, we are not
concerned. The striking fact is established that the United
States has become within six years one of the first oceanic
carriers of the world, a formidable competitor of all the
maritime nations.

Coincident with this growth in the merchant marine was
a tremendous stride forward in battleship construction.
Until the Spanish War, America was not reckoned among
the great sea powers, although her sailors had given a good
account of themselves in many contests upon the ocean.
After Manila Bay and Santiago, however, increasing attention
was given to the navy, and in 1914 the United
States ranked third in naval strength. Then began a period
of feverish activity marked by constantly increasing acceleration.
In 1920 the Navy General Board reported its
grand designs: "A navy second to none recommended by
the General Board in 1915 is still required today. But in
addition the great war has shown the importance of unimpeded
ocean transportation for commerce. If either
belligerent loses the control of the sea, the national fighting
power and endurance are greatly affected. In time of peace
a great and developing country needs a proportionately
great merchant fleet of its own to insure its markets and
preserve its commerce from subservience to rival nations
and their business." That report struck home and its spirit
was reflected in the new building program. So rapid was
American progress that experts were able to calculate that
by 1926 the fighting power of the United States on the
sea would surpass that of Great Britain. The long supremacy
inaugurated in the defeat of the Armada was on
the verge of passing to America when the Washington conference
called a halt in competitive armaments.

So out of the World War \[I\] emerged a new America,
first among the investing, industrial, commercial, maritime,
and naval powers of the earth --- a country endowed
with an immense productive equipment and ready to
penetrate the most inaccessible markets of the most distant
lands. At the same time, a paralysis of Europe cut
down the demand for American agricultural produce and
manufactured goods, and the destruction of the Russian
and German empires gave a new and startling turn to
events in the Orient, leaving Japan without the support of
any great power save England. It was inevitable, amid
these circumstances, that we should witness a burst of
American activity in the Far East.

This is of course a new emphasis rather than a new
factor, for Oriental trade had been an important element
in American economy and politics since the maturity of the
Pacific seaboard states, especially since the acquisition of
the Philippines and the opening of the Panama Canal. The
Pacific has become the new theater. It has been said that
the drama of antiquity was played on the shores of the
Mediterranean and that the drama of the modern world
has been enacted on the shores of the Atlantic. The
drama of the future is preparing on a more majestic stage
where teeming millions stand ready to take part in it. The
curtain has risen upon this new drama. The actors are in
their places, but no living mind can divine even the first
act, to say nothing of the denouement. Asia is old, wise,
fertile in ideas and rich in potential resources. It had its
empires, its religions and philosophies long before the
geese cackled on the banks of the Tiber. Many conquerors
have tried their fortunes there. England has brought the
vast southern peninsula under her imperial dominion, but
her subjects stir ominously and the solid structure may in
time dissolve. Japan, aroused from her lethargy by Yankee
enterprise, is equipped in wealth, industrial power, and
military strength to extend and defend her mighty hegemony.
China, huge, amorphous, beset by a thousand ills,
threatened with dissolution, and restless under the influence
of western ideas, lies prostrate, but, having survived
a hundred conquests and conquerors, may yet smile in
her enigmatic way upon the Lilliputians who assail her.
Russia, at present broken and powerless, seems out of
the play, but that is an illusion except to those who reckon
human affairs in terms of flags and states. The Russian
people multiply with the passing years and they push out
upon the Asiatic plains with the relentless force of an
Alpine glacier. Those who occupy the earth and till the soil
at their feet will in the long run possess it. Russia, the land
of Tolstoi and Lenin and Sazonov and Nicholas Romanov,
still lives and will again play a leading part in the drama
that unrolls in the Pacific basin.

The first speeches of the American actors have already
been delivered. The policy of "the Open Door" has been
announced. It has an immense advantage. It has an ethical
ring. It respects the integrity, sovereignty, and territory of
the Chinese nation. It contemplates no military aggression,
no forcible annexations, no political power. It merely asks
that all nations have equal rights to go and come, buy and
sell, invest and collect in China. In theory it corresponds to
the modern ideal of free commerce, though it may mean
that in practice immense monopolies may be built up,
monopolies such as have arisen in Europe and the United
States out of the same freedom of commerce. In theory it
meets the approval of China, for China, naturally anxious
to preserve her territorial unity against foreign domination,
welcomes assistance. While thus corresponding to China's
immediate desires and expressing an ethical doctrine, the
open-door policy also satisfies the practical interests of the
United States, at present. The seizure and government of
Chinese territory would involve difficulties, financial and
administrative; if opportunities of trade may be secured
without this hazard, territorial annexations would be exercises
in foolhardiness.

The belief in our own disinterestedness in the pursuit of
the open-door policy is so widespread that any opposition
to it on the part of other countries concerned in the Orient
is viewed as a manifestation of unwarranted ill-will. Undoubtedly
American policy offers a striking contrast to the
policy of penetration and aggression followed by many
other powers. Nevertheless, it does not appear to be entirely
benevolent to the seasoned diplomats of the Old World, as
the papers recently published from the Russian archives
show. In these papers, the American State Department is
represented as aiding vigorously in the economic penetration
of China and as supporting American banks with interests
hostile to those of the other powers. It is not necessary
to accept these criticisms at face value or on the basis
of them to entertain doubts as to the correctness of American
diplomacy. That is not the point. The heart of the
matter is that neither Europeans nor the Japanese look
upon American imperial methods in the Orient as different
in any essential respect from those of other powers. The
American goal, they say, is the same, namely, opportunities
for profitable trade and investment, and, as the Philippines
bear witness, territorial expansion is not avoided when it
becomes necessary. The spirit of cynicism and doubt as to
the ultimate intentions of America in the East, though
we may vigorously condemn it, must nevertheless be understood
if we are to gauge correctly forces of the future.
Nowhere is this spirit more accurately reflected than in an
article by an eminent French publicist, in the Mercure de
France for January, 1922. This single passage gives the
heart of the matter:

"The realist, the positive, and especially the financial,
mentality which is the true characteristic of the Yankee
and his _raison d'être_ has been profoundly stirred by the
situation created in the United States during and after the
war --- a situation which he had not foreseen and which is
presented under the form of a genuine paradox. Enriched
in that conflict to the point of securing almost all the gold
of the world, North America nevertheless is passing
through a crisis of appalling proportions; unemployment,
a paralysis of the export trade, and all the economic
calamities, now oppressing American citizens, fell upon
them at the same time as an exceptionally favorable state
of exchange and an unexpected abundance of treasure. It
occurred at once to the minds of these practical men that
it was necessary henceforward to secure a market other
than that afforded by Europe, a field of action in which
their preponderant or semi-sovereign influence will permit
them to sell their products and their primary materials
under conditions of exchange which they will regulate
themselves. Thus they will avoid as far as possible the
economic laws which, in their operation, have become so
dangerous for them in Europe. Since they were powerless
in Europe to regulate the value of money which depends
upon a number of circumstances --- upon a state of affairs
peculiar to the Old World and beyond their control,--- it
was urgent that they should have at their disposal an
Asiatic country where they could act, direct, and organize
at their pleasure and where their commerce would not encounter
the same perils as among their old customers.
China is there, immense and ready, they think, to receive
all authorities, and so disorganized that she is ready to
accept anything they wish to impose upon her. Hence
there were, even during the war, missions of all sorts,
economic, financial, religious, educational, and recreational
sailing from Frisco to the Middle Kingdom.

"At that moment, Japan began to be disturbed. For
other reasons than the United States, even for opposite
reasons, Japan felt the need of extending her influence over
the great Yellow Republic; above all for reasons connected
with natural resources. Wanting in coal and iron,
Japan must of necessity possess these things without depending
upon any powerful nation. Moreover her seventyseven
million people are crowded into a country about as
large as France and at any price it was necessary to search
for an outlet for emigrants. In short, with the United States
established in China, there was at her gate an enemy which
had shown a tenacious hatred for her and an unchanging
contempt for the yellow race, since, according to the
Yankee conception of things, the yellow man, who is only
a charming being when one visits him to get his money,
becomes intolerable when he asks for simple reciprocity.
... Mr. Hughes has proposed that the American
republic should dominate the Pacific --- twenty-eight million
more inhabitants than Japan to undertake the economic
conquest of China, eight super-battleships more
than the Mikado possesses to curb his desires --- there are
the powerful trump cards, and if America succeeds in
making them serve her purpose, she will have a beautiful
party. Although officially disinterested for the moment in
the affairs of Europe, she sees that they are being reintegrated
secretly in general policy through financiers who
meet in their private chambers and associate with themselves
at the council table some Anglo-Saxon business men
and some Germans who more than ever divide the world."
Such is a view of American policy now, by an eminent
French publicist. How much untruth there is in it each
may decide for himself according to his knowledge. Now
that we have set out upon the way it is wise to see ourselves
as our critics see us, for it is our critics, not our
friends, who will make trouble for us.

Whether we accept or reject the criticisms of the French
observer, we cannot overlook the fact that the widely
heralded Washington conference was related mainly, even
almost exclusively, to Pacific, not European, problems.
Though associated in the minds of some with various
world enterprises such as the League of Nations, it was
in fact confined in its chief activities to the practical adjustment
of Pacific matters in such a way as to facilitate
the prosperity of American trade. When the conference
was first called, many enthusiasts began to see visions
of general disarmament and universal peace, but President
Harding sharply reminded them that nothing of the
sort was contemplated. He had in view reducing the cost of
warlike preparations in time of peace, to the great relief
of the burdened taxpayers, and settling certain specific
matters likely to cause friction among the powers concerned.
The two projects were closely knit in the realm of
fact. As President Harding said in his address to the
Senate on February 9, 1922, in submitting the results of
the conference to that body: "Much as it was desirable to
lift the burdens of naval armament and strike at the
menace of competitive construction and consequent expenditures,
the Executive branch of the Government,
which must be watchful for the Nation's safety, was unwilling
to covenant a reduction of armament until there
could be plighted new guarantees of peace, until there
could be removed probable menaces of conflict." After
this plain declaration of prosaic fact, President Harding
went to the heart of the matter. "We have seen the eyes
of the world," he said, "turned to the Pacific. With Europe
prostrate and penitent, none feared the likelihood of early
conflict there. But the Pacific had its menaces and they
deeply concerned us. Our territorial interests are larger
there. Its waters are not strange seas to us, its farther
shores not unknown to our citizens. ... We covet the
possessions of no other power in the Far East and we know
for ourselves that we crave no further or greater governmental
or territorial responsibilities there. Contemplating
what is admittedly ours, and mindful of a long-time and
reciprocal friendship with China, we do wish the opportunity
to continue the development of our trade peacefully
and on equality with other nations." When all the rhetoric,
ceremonials, and formalities are laid aside, there is the sum
and substance of the whole business. "The Pacific had its
menaces and they deeply concerned us."

What were those menaces in fact and deed? Who made
those menaces? No informed person is under any delusions
on this matter. Russia, long the aggressor and high chief
engineer of intrigues against Chinese territory, is paralyzed
and powerless for the present and the indefinite future.
France, though possessed of a huge Indochinese
empire, offers no serious challenge. Germany is bankrupt
in military power and can do no more than make commercial
gestures. There remain England and Japan. They
are the only powers in a position to encroach upon Chinese
territorial integrity, and in 1921 these two powers were
bound by an alliance. "The Pacific had its menaces." They
were real; they were twofold; they were united, and the
United States at the same time had no intention of surrendering
any of the opportunities of American merchants,
manufacturers, and financiers in China.

Thus it happened that the desires of the taxpayers for
relief and the pacific aspirations of the American people,
coincided with a genuine crisis in the Far Eastern relations
of the American government. For eight years conditions
had been abnormal. President Wilson, as the spokesman of
planters, farmers, and trade unions, did not continue the
aggressive policy pursued by the Secretary of State, Philander
Knox, in the advancement of American trading and
investing interests in the East. Moreover the war had dislocated
forces, engaged the energies of England, paralyzed
Russia, eliminated Germany, and given Japan a free hand.
In fact, between the retirement of President Taft and the
inauguration of President Harding, Japan had made immense
strides in the extension of her hegemony over
China. At first she operated in conjunction with Russia,
with the consent of England. Then, in the midst of the
war, Japan made her famous Twenty-one Demands, which
in effect promised to destroy the remnants of Chinese
sovereignty. Mr. Wilson, so zealous in the interest of universal
peace and the League of Nations, approved the
Lansing-Ishü doctrine, let Shantung go to Japan, and neglected
Yap.

It is in the light of these things that the results of the
Washington conference must be examined. First, there is
the naval holiday and the Four Power treaty. As all conversant
with naval affairs know, by 1924 or 1926 at the
latest, according to the prevalent rate of construction, the
United States would have been supreme at sea over Great
Britain in fighting units and weight of metal. But Great
Britain was united to Japan by a treaty of alliance and the
two constituted a formidable power. By offering debtburdened
Britain a relief in naval construction the United
States induced her to cut loose from a separate alliance
with Japan. Hence the naval holiday. It is an immense
gain to the taxpayers. It gives experts time to study the
whole question of sea fighting in view of the great probability
that dreadnoughts and super-dreadnoughts are as
obsolete as wooden walls.

The accompanying Four Power treaty is likewise susceptible
of many interpretations as to origin, purpose, and
implications. The terms of the instrument are very general.
The high contracting parties agree to respect one another's
insular possessions in the Pacific and to enter into communication
in case any disturbance arises in that connection.
On its face that declaration appears to be a truism.
President Harding informed the Senate and the country
that "nothing in any of these treaties commits the United
States or any other power to any kind of alliance, entanglement
or envolvement." But, as if baffled by his own
statement, he added: "It has been said, if this be true,
these are meaningless treaties and therefore valueless. Let
us accept no such doctrine of despair as that." It has been
stated, but not officially, that the purpose of the Four
Power treaty was to destroy the Anglo-Japanese alliance
and if this is true the somewhat uncertain terms become
full of meaning. At all events the way is made clear for
the pursuit of the open-door trading policy in China.

More precise is the treaty laying down the principles to
be pursued with regard to China. The high contracting
parties once more proclaim the sovereignty, the independence,
the territorial and administrative integrity of China,
and free and equal opportunity for commerce and industry.
They agree that they will not seek or support their
nationals in seeking: (a) any arrangement which might
purport to establish in favor of their interests any general
superiority of right with respect to commercial or economic
development in any designated regions of China;
(b) any such monopoly or preference as would deprive the
nationals of any other power of the right of undertaking
any legitimate trade or industry in China or of participating
with the Chinese government or with any local
authority in any category of public enterprise, or which
by reason of its scope, duration, or geographical extent is
calculated to frustrate the practical application of the
principle of equal opportunity.

Two things are to be noted about this treaty. The language,
though perhaps as specific as circumstances admitted,
is nevertheless general in character. It is open to
a variety of interpretations in the application. It is less
specific and pointed than the language of the famous Algeciras
compact which was supposed to put an end to
friction among the powers in Morocco. It does not contain
the detailed provisions, limitations, prohibitions, and specifications
laid down in 1906 for the conduct of the Sultan's
estate. That is the first point to be noted. The second is
that it is, like the Algeciras compact, applicable to a
country in disorder and revolution, to a rapidly changing
situation, not to a settled society like the United States or
England where commerce can be carried on without recourse
to armed force. When France was reproached
with having torn up the compact of Algeciras, she could
with justice reply that local conditions were such that its
application, according to the ordinary norms of legal procedure,
was impossible. So it was.

### Conclusions

Anyone who has given two or three years to the study
of the course of affairs in Europe since 1918 will hesitate
to advance with firm assurance very many "conclusions."
The pages which follow should really be entitled "A Few
General and Tentative Reflections." Europe is in an unstable
equilibrium and serious changes may take place
any moment. Generalizations are dangerous. Prophecy is
more dangerous. But the human mind longs for something
more positive than a glimpse at a swirling tide. Hence
these last words.

The first reflection is perhaps the easiest to formulate.
There are many signs of European recovery in the realm
of fact. The reconstruction work in France has been truly
marvelous. The basic industry, agriculture, though disturbed
by agrarian changes in Eastern Europe, is being
restored and a decided turn upward may be expected
shortly. The quarrels among the new nationalities are
being allayed by negotiations and treaties and new bonds
of trade and intercourse are taking the place of those
snapped by the war. In this sphere time will bring healing.

Secondly, finance and industry in Europe are in a state
of chaos and conditions are growing worse rather than
better. If the analysis \[in another volume\] ... is sound, it
is difficult to see how business can be brought to its old
course without reducing reparations and inter-allied debts,
scaling down domestic debts, and restoring the currency to
a gold basis. Europe must soon choose between some kind
of a general economic constitution and a realignment of
powers for more costly and deadly conflicts.

Thirdly, the principle of conscious and systematic support
for commercial enterprise has been adopted by England,
France, Germany, and Italy, and the capitalists of
these countries are driving forward to the conquest of
new markets with a greater zeal than in the days before
the war. There is this difference: they are more effectively
organized within their respective countries and more
vigorously supported by their respective governments. The
restoration of Europe without a constitution designed to
mitigate these rivalries will mean a return to secret diplomacy
and the armed peace, preparatory to a re-enactment
of the great drama which we have just witnessed. What
would be left of European civilization after several repetitions
of this cycle may be left to the imagination. But if
Europe cannot learn from experience, it is hardly probable
that more pronunciamentos from Washington will have
any effect upon the course of events there.

Fourthly, there seem to be only two policies open to the
United States. The first is to enter into a general European
council and attempt by international pressure to compel a
readjustment of indemnities, debts, tariffs, and currencies;
that is, to join in forcing the various nations to do what
they must do before the course of business is returned to
a pre-war basis. If anyone will read the European press
closely, he will see what grave complications this would
involve, what new hatreds, what new discords. In my
opinion it would be unwise for the United States to attempt
to play the part of a general receiver or a big brother
for Europe tortured by the inevitable after-war hatreds.
This is not because we are wanting in the spirit of helpfulness,
but because in this case intermeddling is likely to do
more harm than good. The other course is that now pursued,
except as far as Russia is concerned. It is the course
of allowing Europe to set its own house in order under the
stress of its own necessities and experiences. Its statesmen
know little enough, perhaps, but they know Europe better
than any agents sent out from Washington.

Fifthly, if the United States leaves Europe to its own
devices in recovering its economic prosperity, then logic as
well as common decency requires our government to refrain
from publishing periodical homilies on the place of
Russia in Europe's affairs.

Sixthly, new loans to European countries by American
banking houses, though they yield high commissions and
high interest rates at present, merely add to the burdens
and confusion of Europe and help postpone the day of
fiscal reckoning which all continental countries must face
sooner or later. Indeed these very loans may involve us,
in spite of ourselves, in grave problems of readjustment
now facing European statesmen.

Finally, the menaces that confront the United States
today are not European. As President Harding has said,
they are in the Pacific. What does that mean? What does
it imply in terms of American policy and of obligations
for American citizens? President Harding has given us
the key. He says that we do not want any more territory
in the Pacific, but that we want trade. That means, in plain
English, that we want markets in China in which to sell
goods; we want opportunities to invest money with good
commissions and high rates of interest; and we want concessions
to build railways, exploit natural resources, and
develop Chinese industries to our profit. Assuming that
the open door is really open, that means intense and active
rivalry with England, France, and Japan in the Far East.
So the great question is: "Shall the government follow
trade and investments?"

That is the crucial question. It is a question fraught
with momentous significance for this country. Behind all
the notes, treaties, speeches, and declarations, that is the
one great issue in foreign affairs before the people of this
country. It must be considered without bitterness or partisan
rancor in the light of national interests and national
destiny. There must be no sneering criticism of our manufacturers
and bankers. They are following economic opportunities
as other men do. Nothing short of the interest
of the whole nation should come into the decisions upon
policy.

At this fateful juncture in American history, there are
three courses open to those who fain would mold the world
to their hearts' desires. There is, first, the policy of positive
imperialism, naked and unashamed. Under it, our
government would give vigorous support to merchants,
bankers, and manufacturers in all parts of the earth in
their search for trade and investment opportunities. It
presupposes armies and navies adequate to all exigencies
and strong enough to compel respect for all decisions taken
in behalf of national economic interests. The Department
of State, operating mainly in secret through a corps of
consuls and diplomats, would become the adjunct to industrial
and investment interests. A merchant marine
would be subsidized, and government support given to the
prosecution of commercial advantages. Discriminatory and
preferential tariffs would be constructed with reference to
the promotion of American industries.

This policy is commonly defended on two grounds.
Some say that it is the natural, inevitable, and irresistible
development of an imperial race --- the manifest destiny of
every nation to expand, conquer, and dominate. Possibly
it is the decree of fate. If so, then all arguments for and
against it are equally futile and irrelevant.

Others, brushing aside such philosophy, say that imperialism
is necessary to American prosperity, that we
must sell more and more manufactured goods every year
or perish. Let us examine briefly that hypothesis in operation.
More billions in trade means bringing more business
to American manufacturing industries and drawing more
millions of people from Europe and from our own countryside
into mines, mills, and factories. It means more
billions in stocks and bonds in strongboxes, and more millions
of men, women, and children in industrial cities-a
vaster aristocracy of wealth and a huger proletariat. Whoever
can contemplate the possibility of a hundred years of
that development without thought of consequences lying
beyond, deserves to wear the badge of courage. Still the
policy involved in it may be pursued without regard to the
long future.

Imperialism is not new. It offers no novel features to
the adventurous spirit of man. The past affords ample
records for the study of its processes, operations, and consequences.
It cannot however be pursued today under the
conditions of the past three hundred years. The experience
of the British Empire is no guide to us now. The backward
places of the earth are all staked out and in the possession
of powers bent upon the kind of commercial and financial
imperialism that is recommended to us. Imperialism of
the future will involve competitive risks far more dangerous
than the risks of Pitt, Disraeli, and Sir Edward Grey.
Still the policy is an intelligible one and is defended by
some of the ablest minds of our generation. Ample support
for it is to be found in the voluminous literature of
the late German Empire.

There is before us, possibly, a second policy. It is covered
by that term of opprobrium hurled at it by the devotees
of imperialism, namely, "Little Americanism." Its
implications are likewise clear. Let us examine them. According
to this philosophy, the government of the United
States would not lend diplomatic or any other kind of support
to investment bankers placing loans abroad, \[whether\]
in making them, collecting the interest, or insuring the
principal. It would not use the army or the navy in the
collection of debts due to private citizens. The government
would feel under no greater obligation to a banker who
made a bad loan in Guatemala than it would to a banker
who made a bad guess in lending money to a dry-goods
merchant in Des Moines, Iowa. It would not seize any
more territory. It would discontinue the policy of annexing
spheres in the Caribbean and would invite the Latin
American countries into a co-operative system for settling
all disputes in this hemisphere. It would give independence
to the Philippines and draw back upon the Hawaiian base.
It would maintain an army and a navy adequate for the defense
of our territories, by universal service if necessary,
and perhaps preferably. It might possibly contemplate
entering a League of Nations, provided all other countries
were prepared to adopt a similar domestic policy. It would
bend all national energies and all national genius upon the
creation of a civilization which, in power and glory and
noble living, would rise above all the achievements of the
past. This policy, whatever may be said against it, has on
its side at least the advantage and interest of novelty. The
great power that pursued it might, indeed, sink down into
dust like the empires of Tamerlane or Augustus, but at
least the world's experiences would be enriched.

There is finally another alternative, that of no policy at
all, save the policy of drift and muddle. It would support
our capitalists and merchants abroad, but not adequately.
It would encourage them to pursue their economic interests
and then fail to sustain them in a crucial hour. It
would create, inadvertently, situations calling for imperial
military and naval forces, but would not have the forces
ready on the fateful day. It would follow in the paths of
Alexander and Cæsar but would be content with the
philosophy of Buncombe County. Yet, under Providence
many things might be accomplished by this policy. It might
land the nation at the gates of destruction; but that can
be said of the imperial policy pursued by Rome and
Germany. As in individual life we find our little plans and
purposes but frail reeds in our hands, so in national life,
the wisdom, understanding, and penetration of the best
and most practical statesmen often prove to be in the
test of time and circumstance the weirdest of delusions.

Here I take leave of the subject, saying with Bossuet,
the good bishop: "All those who are engaged in the work
of government are subject to a higher power. They always
do more or less than they intend and their counsels have
never failed to produce unforeseen effects. They are not
the masters of the turn given to affairs by the ages past.
Neither can they foresee the course the future will take.
Far less can they force it." Still, who would not rather
have the heritage of Athens than the legacy of Cæsar?
