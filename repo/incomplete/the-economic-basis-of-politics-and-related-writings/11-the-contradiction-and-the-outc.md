## The Contradiction and the Outcome[^/85]

Three general conclusions were reached in the preceding
chapters. A survey of six great systems of political
philosophy supports the proposition that there is a vital relation
between the forms of state and the distribution of
property, revolutions in the state being, usually, the results
of contests over property. A study of the evolution
of government in Western civilization during many centuries
shows the recognition of economic classes in the
creation of political organisms. Finally, modern equalitarian
democracy, which reckons all heads as equal and
alike, cuts sharply athwart the philosophy and practice of
the past centuries.

Nevertheless, the democratic device of universal suffrage
does not destroy economic classes or economic inequalities.
It ignores them. Herein lies the paradox, the
most astounding political contradiction that the world has
ever witnessed. Hence the question arises: Has political
democracy solved the problem of the ages, wrung the answer
from the sphinx? Is it a guarantee against the storms
of revolution? Does it make impossible such social conflicts
as those which tore ancient societies asunder? Does
it afford to mankind a mastery over its social destiny?


[^/85]: Compiler's note: This chapter is primarily the 1922 revision
of one of Beard's 1916 lectures, dealing among other
things with Russian developments. When Beard reprinted the
chapter during 1945 in the last edition of The Economic Basis
of Politics, he added a footnote to the Russian passages of
1922, referring to a modernized, amplified, and clarified account
of the Russian story appearing in the next chapter, just
added. To save the reader the bother of inspecting the obsolete
parts of the 1922 passage, then flipping the pages to reach the
1945 presentation, the two versions have been consolidated
within the confines of the present Chapter VI. Since the integration
improves the illustrations without altering the original
theme or one single word of the conclusions, the compiler believes
the operation to have been fully justified.

To ask these questions is to answer them. Nothing was
more obvious in the thinking of Western civilization before
the outbreak of \[World War I\] than dissatisfaction with
political democracy. Equally obvious was the discontent
with representative government based on the doctrine of
abstract numbers and civic equality. Whether one went into
the countryside of Oregon or strolled along Quai d'Orsay,
one heard lively debates over "the failure of representative
government." The initiative and referendum and recall ---
direct government --- more head-counting on the theory of
numbers and abstract equality, such was the answer of the
Far West to the riddle. Europe had another answer, or
rather many other answers.

Indeed, John Stuart Mill, in his work on representative
government published in 1859, nearly ten years before the
radical suffrage measure of 1867, sensed grave dangers
ahead. He utterly rejected the theory that political democracy
would inevitably avoid those acts of selfishness and
arbitrary power that had characterized monarchies and
oligarchies and aristocracies. "Looking at democracy in the
way in which it is commonly conceived," he said, "as the
rule of the numerical majority, it is surely possible that the
ruling power may be under the dominion of sectional or
class interests pointing to conduct different from that which
would be dictated by impartial regard for the interest of
all. ... In all countries there is a majority of poor, a
minority who, in contradistinction, may be called rich. Between
these two classes, on many questions, there is a complete
opposition of interest. We will suppose the majority
sufficiently intelligent to be aware that it is not to their
advantage to weaken the security of property, and that it
would be weakened by any act of arbitrary spoliation. But
is there not considerable danger lest they should throw
upon the possessors of what is called realizable property
and upon larger incomes, an unfair share, or even the
whole of the burden of taxation; and having done so, add
to the amount without scruple, expending the proceeds in
modes supposed to conduce to the profit and advantage of
the labouring class?" Mill then goes on to cite other examples
of the possible abuse of political power in the
interests of the economic classes.

His solution of the problem was a balance of classes and
the introduction of minority or proportional representation.
"If the representative system could be made ideally perfect,"
he said, "and if it were possible to maintain it in
that state, its organization should be such that these two
classes, manual labourers and their affinities on one side,
employers of labour and their affinities on the other, should
be, in the arrangement of the representative system,
equally balanced, each influencing about an equal number
of votes in Parliament." The more rational minority in
each class should then hold the balance. "Assuming that
the majority of each class, in any differences between them,
would be mainly governed by their class interests, there
would be a minority of each in whom that consideration
would be subordinate to reason, justice, and the good of
the whole; and this minority of either joining with the
whole of the other, would turn the scale against any demands
of their own majority which were not such as
ought to prevail."

Whether this solution is fanciful or sound need not detain
us now. The point is that this learned and sincere
friend of democracy, writing at the middle of the nineteenth
century, believed that the introduction of "numerical
democracy" had not solved and could not resolve the
most fundamental of all contradictions: namely the contests
over property and the distribution of wealth that accompany
the development of civilization. Indeed Mill's
very solution, minority representation, in effect was designed
to reintroduce, without rigid legal divisions, the
scheme of class representation which had been for centuries
the basis of all parliamentary systems. On the significance
of this it is not necessary to comment.

Long after Mill's day a group of continental writers,
Leon Duguit, Charles Benoist, and Albert Schaeffle, for
example, declared the system of artificial territorial divisions
and numerical majorities to be a sham and a delusion,
and advocated the frank and legal recognition of commerce,
industry, property, professions, and crafts in the
constitution of the representative system. They held that
the doctrine of abstract equality was essentially false and in
plain contradiction to the facts of modern social life. They
declared that it made the politician a sort of broker (hardly
an honest one at that) mediating between conflicting
groups and slipping into parliament by deluding electors
with phrases, promises, and rhetoric. Thus, in their opinion,
the state had passed from the hands of practical and
informed men of affairs into the control of the "politicians"
--- men without any business qualifications whose stock in
trade was oratory. Thus they could only see disaster ahead,
unless the rhetoricians were expelled and representation
restored to the basis of economic realities.

Even more savage in their criticism of numerical democracy
and abstract political equality were the socialists.
They also declared that the idea of political equality and
economic inequality contained an inherent contradiction.
They offered, however, a drastic solution --- the ownership
of all productive property by society and the consequent
destruction of both the capitalist class and the working
class. The guild socialists, as another school was called,
proposed to substitute for the system of numerical and territorial
representation a congress composed of delegates
from the various craft or trade unions. Still other socialists,
fearing the disruptive effects of craft jealousies, insisted
that at least one branch of the parliament should
represent the people considered as a national unity as
distinguished from the people divided into crafts and
unions. These last reformers argued that man was a civic
and patriotic animal and that his whole nature was not expressed
or exhausted in his capacity as an engineer, machinist,
or farmer.

All these schemes, however, remained devices on paper
until the communist upheaval in Russia in November, 1917. Then ... the idea of political democracy was denounced
and cast aside as a mere "bourgeois" device calculated
to delude the working class. In the place of a congress
of representatives chosen by equal suffrage from territorial
districts having substantially the same number of
inhabitants, there was established a soviet or council representing
economic groups as such ... a simple and
drastic attempt to dispose of the contradiction between
political theory and economic facts. ...

\[The early councils representing workers, peasants, and
soldiers were transitional in nature. Under communist
theory all classes, including the proletariat, were to disappear.
When the new Russian constitution was drawn up
in 1936 representation in the All-Union Congress was
based on two principles. For one chamber delegates are
apportioned according to population --- one delegate per
300,000 inhabitants. In the second chamber, called the
Council of Nationalities, the republics constituting the
Union are represented. Thus the Russian constitution of
1936 bears no traces of the class-system such as appeared
in the early councils representing workers, peasants, and
soldiers. ... \][^/89]

\[Meanwhile, the capitalist class has been eliminated
through the seizure of commerce and industry by the
state.\][^/90] What had appeared in 1919 to be an insuperable
obstacle to a complete nationalization of agriculture.
-the tenacity with which the small peasants clung to their
lands-was finally overcome, subject to minor concessions.
Lenin had opposed the use of violence against the peasant.
After he died, however, the Soviet government adopted a
policy of extreme land nationalization and carried it out
forcible methods --- including the "liquidation" and deportation
of recalcitrant peasants by the millions. Thus a propertied
class numerically large was exterminated, and communism,
or collectivization, was established even in agriculture.[^/91]
By 1939 the small landowners of the old régime
had gone the way of the great landlords, bureaucrats, and
middle classes of the Tsarist days. Former class barriers
had been leveled.


[^/89]: Compiler's note: This bracketed paragraph, originally inserted
by Beard in 1945 as a footnote, has been elevated to the
body of the text to clarify the theme.


[^/90]: Compiler's note: Immediately after this bracketed sentence
of mine, there begins the new material on the Russian situation
prepared by Beard in 1945, shifted ahead here from its former
place on pp. 77--87 of Chapter V of the 1945 edition of The
Economic Basis of Politics.


[^/91]: "In 1940 almost all the agricultural production in the
\[Soviet\] Union came from the 240,000 consolidated collective
farms that had taken the place of the 25,000,000 separate
peasant holdings that had existed in 1928." B. H. Sumner, A
Short History of Russia (1943), p. 115. Only a certain number
of animals, small implements, and gardens are now individually
owned, but this branch of private enterprise is highly
productive.

According to communist theory Russia was now supposed
to be "classless," for the distinctions founded on
landed and other forms of material property had been extinguished,
at least as far as direct ownership was concerned.
But other important kinds of social distinction rapidly
developed. The introduction of technology into socialized
agriculture was attended by gradations of technical
competence among the millions nominally called "workers
on the land." In connection with this transformation appeared
large numbers of agronomists, engineers, skilled
farm mechanics, managers, bookkeepers, specialists in plant
and animal husbandry, and other sorts of experts. Moreover,
in the train of the vast industrialization came a differentiation
of urban occupations and callings almost as
complicated and hierarchical as those to be found in the
capitalistic societies of the West: engineers and managers
of all kinds, plant foremen, and a classified personnel ranging
from skilled machine operatives at the apex to untrained
casual laborers at the bottom.

To plan, co-ordinate, direct, and govern the huge economic
and political aggregations of the Russian Union, an
immense bureaucracy was evolved. It was graded from the
over-all executives at the top down through various territorial
and specialized officials to the petty functionaries at
the lowest rung of the ladder. Amid the exigencies of military
preparations and war, an armed force of gigantic
proportions was created and it also had its graded personnel
ranging from the chief of staff down to non-commissioned
officers and regimented men.

In the civil and foreign wars which immediately followed
the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, Soviet authorities had
been compelled to rely upon improvisation --- mainly upon
the selection of military leaders from among the rank and
file of soldiers and, indeed, from among civilians. The
spectacular military performances of Trotsky as an amateur,
in the period of the civil warfare, illustrates this point.

But, as time passed, more and more reliance was placed on
men professionally trained for war, and provisions were
made for their training. Thus a large body of professional
military officers came into being, with a corresponding system
of military education, selection, promotion, distinctions
in rank, and esprit de corps. Unlike the officer class of
Prussian Junkers, whose landed property gave them a
certain degree of economic independence as against the
state, the new Russian officer class was wholly dependent
upon the state for its emoluments, prestige, and distinctions.

If, after years of such developments, the post-revolutionary
Russian society was still nominally classless, in the
sense that there were no longer classes based on the ownership
of land and other productive property, it was in
fact a highly differentiated society, with great divergencies
in power, security, and income. If there were no propertied
classes, there were income-classes, and classes with
favored positions in respect of advancement and economic
advantages. As the differentiation proceeded, a tendency to
stratification appeared, first in fact and then more slowly in
law. This process was quickened by an early abandonment
of the communist formula: "from each according to his
ability and to each according to his needs," and the substitution
of "incentive pay" for industrial workers and graded
salaries for members of the civil and military bureaucracy.

As a consequence of the larger incomes for members of
the upper grades of workers in industries and for members
of the higher civil and military bureaucracy, millions of
Russians were able to accumulate money for personal expenditures
or for deposit in savings banks or investment in
government bonds. If nominally on the same footing as
other Russian citizens, these recipients of higher incomes
formed a substantial portion of the population differentiated
from their less fortunate neighbors in the matter of claims
to personal property and goods. The children of these people
possessed privileges denied to the offspring of less
favored families: privileges of leisure, comfort, convenience,
and education, helpful in the gratification of tastes
and ambitions. Such children could be better prepared for
passing entrance examinations to the institutions of higher
learning that trained youth for the civil and military professions
and for occupations in the upper ranges of industry
and the bureaucracy. After graduation they could
call on powerful friends for help in securing lucrative positions
in \[the\] economic hierarchy.

In this course of affairs, the family, treated by many of
the early Bolsheviks as a moribund bourgeois institution,
was gradually brought back into the history from which
they had sought to expel it. Russian laws accelerated the
restoration: for example, legislation relative to inheritance,
marriage, maternal subsidies, divorce, and abortion. It is
true that Russia was not reviving landed, industrial, and
financial families of the old style. But Russia was reconstituting
the family as an economic, cultural, and social
institution, with all that this implied in terms of marked
differentiations in society. By intermarriage among members
of the upper-income families, family ties and family influences
in economy, education, and the struggle for position
were reinforced.[^/92]

These tendencies in Russian society did not signify, as
some American innocents abroad liked to imagine, a return
to historic capitalism or "free enterprise." They did
indicate, however, that the communist ideal of free and
equal individuals, having identical economic opportunities,
having no special privileges of income and position, was
not being realized. It also meant that, however "classless"
Russian society might now be in theory, it had in truth
highly differentiated and graded economic interests which
were recognized by government and law. Moreover, it
meant that as such interests grew in vigor, they were bound
to find expression in the thinking, the ideology, and, more
or less, in the politics of the country.


[^/92]: From the standpoint of those old Bolsheviks who regarded
the family as a form of bourgeois servitude to be abolished in
favor of sex liberty, the most revolutionary piece of Soviet
legislation in respect of the family is the Act of July 8, 1944,
providing subsidies and special monthly pensions for mothers,
graded in amount according to the number of their children.
The Act also grants other special privileges to mothers, accords
special protection to them and their children, creates medals and
orders of maternity, imposes special taxes on childless and
small families, and makes modifications in the former laws
relative to matrimony, the family, and guardianship. A Spanish
translation of this Act appears in Boletín de Información (Legation
of the Soviet Union at Havana) for February 5, 1945.
This number also contains valuable articles on the Russian
family. One of the most interesting of these articles is entitled
La Familia Sovietica, Escuela de Patriotismo, pp. 8--9.
For criticism of the libertarian theories in respect of marriage
during the early years of the Revolution, see pp. 10--11.

Ten years after the Revolution of 1917 a stratification
of the Russian communist society had already become
marked. In 1927, when the Communist party claimed approximately
1,200,000 members, about 600,000 were officials
and bureaucratic employees of the government, as
against 150,000 workers on the land and 450,000 workers
in factories. These officials and bureaucratic employees had
accumulated considerable personal property. According to
the figures for 1930, individual deposits in savings banks
amounted to 476,000,000 rubles (apart from the deposits
of co-operatives and collectives); and of this total, officials
and bureaucratic employees held 205,000,000 rubles, while
laborers held 90,000,000 rubles, and peasants held the
balance.[^/0931] In three years, between 1925 and 1928, the
number of holders of internal-loan bonds in Soviet Russia
increased from 100,000 to 10,000,000.[^/0932] Exact figures for
later dates are not available but it is estimated that in 1939
more than 50,000,000 people were holders of state bonds,
and that at the end of 1944 internal bonds to the amount
of 117,200,000,000 rubles were outstanding.[^/0933] At the beginning
of 1940 at least 37,000 savings banks were in
operation and had on deposit a little more than 7,000,000,000
rubles. The total number of depositors was then
placed at 16,802,000 as compared with 15,547,000 in 1939.[^/0934]

Internationale Politik," Europaische Gespräche, October, 1928,
p. 514, note.


[^/0933]: From the total outstanding debt should be deducted gifts of
bonds to the state by private citizens. These gifts have been
large. In 1944 it was announced that gifts of state bonds to
the amount of 4 billion rubles had been made to the Red Army
Fund. But figures for the total amount of gifts do not seem to
be available in the United States at the beginning of the year 1945.


[^/0934]: Among the sources for more recent figures on the Russian
debt and savings bank deposits are: U. S. Department of Commerce,
"Internal Debt Compiled from Announcements of
Loans in Russian Newspapers" by E. C. Ropes; U. S. Department
of Commerce, "Russian Economic Notes, March 15,
1940"; the American Review of the Soviet Union, June, 1941;
Soviet Information Bulletin, September 29, 1944.

The statistical publications of Soviet Russia, at least
those now available in the United States, provide little or
no information about gradations in income-groups. They
certainly do not permit the presentation of an exact picture
showing: (1) all the various occupational groups and the
exact number of persons in each group; (2) a classification
of the Russian population according to incomes and the
number of persons in each income-bracket (such as may be
found in the official statistics of the United States); and
(3) a classification of population according to holdings of
property, such as household goods, government bonds,
savings deposits, land and livestock allotments, authors'
royalty rights, and so forth.

But Russian official documents do indicate that Russian
society is divided into a number of classes, each consisting
of individuals receiving incomes within a certain range,
and all graded from low levels of income upward to annual
salaries of 24,000 rubles and more per year. Though the
Soviet government apparently does not make available the
exact number of persons in each income category, the fact
of the income categories is recognized and used in the tax
legislation (Old Income Tax, 1940 rates; Housing and
Cultural Tax, 1940 rates; and War Income Tax of December
29, 1941).

Special evidence bearing on the stratification of Russian
society comes from reports on the tax and revenue system
of the Soviet government. That system reflects and in some
respects accentuates the gradations in Russian economy. It
is not wholly grounded on the simple equalitarian principle
that the tax laid on each person should be exactly adjusted
to his income or ability to pay. In other words, the nature
and rates of taxation in Soviet Russia are not such as to
make the members of the various income groups carry tax
burdens apportioned strictly and progressively according
to their respective abilities in terms of wealth.

On this point we have recent information from Dr.
Jerome Davis, a sympathetic and observant student of
Russian institutions.[^/95] The largest single source of revenue
for the Soviet state, he says, is "the turnover tax." Far less
important as a revenue producer is the war income tax. Dr.
Davis says that annual income up to 1,800 rubles is taxable
to the amount of 120 rubles. The tax rate rises but
apparently levels off at incomes of 24,000 rubles; it is 1,020
rubles on incomes between 9,600 and 10,800 rubles; and it
is 2,700 rubles on incomes above 24,000 rubles. On farmers,
it ranges from 150 to 500 rubles a year. There are, of
course, various exemptions. Voluntary donations and lotteries
afford substantial revenues. Another source is state
loans. At the outset of the war in 1941 the state debt was
about 50,000,000,000 rubles; three war loans of 1942,
1943, and 1944 brought in around 61,000,000,000 rubles.

Official reports and other publications issued under the
auspices of the Soviet government or with its authorization
permit, therefore, a classification of the Russian people on
the basis of power, culture, and/or income, which often
corresponds more or less closely to positions in the hierarchy.
Exact figures are lacking, but the following general
picture as of 1944 is based on a substantial documentation:

1. High officials in the Communist party. The party
   membership is about 5,000,000. High officials in the
   party are often high officials in the Soviet government
   on its political side and on its economic side.
2. High officials and intellectuals in Russian society,
   inside and outside the Communist party, often with
   relatively high incomes, especially those in posts of industrial management and those engaged in writing, editing, and propaganda.
3. Minor officials of the white-collar class, numbering
   millions: engineers, technicians, statisticians, economists,
   bookkeepers, chauffeurs, mechanics, teachers, police, and
   so forth.
4. Industrial workers of many types, crafts, and skills.
   Their number is variously estimated at from one-fifth of
   the population upward.
5. Workers on the land (peasants) comprising about
   one-half of the population. The amount of time given by
   the land worker to labor on state farms and the amount
   given to the cultivation of his own allotment varies from
   place to place and time to time.
6. Forced labor. Composed of prisoners of one kind
   or another scattered about the country in labor camps.
   Exact number unknown. Sometimes estimated in the
   millions.


[^/95]: The New Republic, January 1, 1945 (cabled from Moscow).

If long experiences in other ages and places are any
guide in making forecasts, certain things are likely to
happen in Russia during the coming years. As James Madison
might put the case, these strong and often conflicting
interests will perdure and provide substance and force in
Russian politics in the future. Should Russia enter into a
long era of peace, the more powerful among these interests
could scarcely fail to seek representation and force in government,
if not control over the state. Should the military
interest become supreme in the decades ahead, it would
subdue civilian interests to its will, perhaps for a long
period of time. For, as Daniel Webster's axiom runs, it is
only in the absence of the sword that economic interests
may rule (above, p. 38).

With military interests, foreign as well as domestic politics
comes into consideration. No military body whose
directors are recruited largely from an officer, or military,
class can easily maintain itself in power, if at all, without
wars and rumors of war. Historically, Russia had been one
of the great warlike nations of Europe during more than a
century prior to the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. For a
time, and partly owing to its internal weakness at first, Bolshevik
Russia renounced imperialism and under compulsion
surrendered large areas of the country to her neighbors. To
some extent this repudiation of imperialism was due to the
hope of idealists that workers' revolutions would occur all
over Europe and lead to a federation of communist republics.
But after 1939, and particularly after the sensational
victories over the Germans in the Second World War,
Russian leadership seemed to renew the territorial and
power ambitions of Tsarist Russia.

As everyone knows who has even an elementary acquaintance
with Russian history since the age of Peter the
Great, Russian territorial and power ambitions have contemplated
a wide sweep in Europe and Asia and have been
accompanied by the rise and growth of Pan-Slavism. That
Russian military planning and education will take these
traditions into account, for strategic studies, preparations,
and calculations of actions, is practically certain. Nor will
the upper levels of the civilian bureaucracy be indifferent
to the advantages that may be derived from economic and
other forms of penetration into regions around the borders
of the great Soviet Union. And here a peculiar factor may
come into service. Unlike the interests behind the imperialist
expansion of Western countries, Russian interests are
vitalized by ideological ties with revolutionary parties in
other areas, near and distant; they may profit by, if they
do not foment, disturbances that will lead to intervention
in a manner that resembles imperialistic action but may be
defended on "moral" grounds.[^/97]

The upshot of all this seems to be that in a modern industrial
society, the problem of property, so vital in politics,
is not as simple as it was in old agricultural societies.
It was one thing for peasants to destroy their landlords
and go on tilling the soil as they had long been wont to do.
It is another thing for workingmen to destroy capitalists as
a class and assume all the complex and staggering burdens
of management and exchange. It is also clear that, as efficient
production depends to a great extent upon skill, skill
itself is a form of property even if property in capital is
abolished.

In short a great society, whether capitalist or communist,
must possess different kinds and grades of skill and talent
and carry on widely diversified industries. There must be
miners, machinists, electricians, engineers, accountants,
transport workers, draftsmen, managers, and a hundred
other kinds of specialists. They may be temporarily welded
together in a conflict with their capitalist employers, but
they will be divided over the distribution of wealth among
themselves after the capitalists have been disposed of.
Conceivably a highly militarist government might destroy
their organizations and level them down, but the result
would be the ruin of production and of the state itself.
Even a communist could hardly defend his system on the
theory that all must choose between military despotism and
utter ruin.


[^/97]: Compiler's note: Here ends the passage on Russia shifted
ahead from its original position in the 1945 edition of The
Economic Basis of Politics.

The grand conclusion, therefore, seems to be exactly that
advanced by our own James Madison in the tenth number
of The Federalist. To express his thought in modern terms:
a landed interest, a transport interest, a railway interest, a
shipping interest, an engineering interest, a manufacturing
interest, a public-official interest, with many lesser interests,
grow up of necessity in all great societies and divide them
into different classes actuated by different sentiments and
views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests,
whatever may be the formula for the ownership of
property, constitutes the principal task of modern statesmen
and involves the spirit of party in the necessary and
ordinary operations of government. In other words, there
is no rest for mankind, no final solution of eternal contradictions.
Such is the design of the universe. The recognition
of this fact is the beginning of wisdom --- and of statesmanship.
