## Nature of Political Parties[^/172]

\[Compiler's note: Shortly after the new government
created in conformity with the Constitution began to
function, there arose differences of opinion as to what it
should do. Those having strong convictions on the subject
helped to form national political parties. It is to this partisan
period of American history that attention is now
devoted.\]

### Origin of Parties

Why do political parties arise? The question is hard to
answer. Certainly the solutions of the problem offered by
writers on the subject are vague and contradictory.

According to one view, politics is merely a great game
or sport, an endless contest between the ins and outs, full of
sound and fury, springing from no substantial interests,
affecting in no vital way the state of the people. Citizens
divide into political parties for reasons no more important
than those which separate them into partisans of Gene
Tunney or Jack Dempsey. Politics is all a question of finding
slogans that will capture the crowd or discovering candidates
that will awaken enthusiasm. "If the Republicans
can find the proper candidate," remarked Dr. George B.
Cutten, President of Colgate University, in the Sunday
Times of May 13, 1928, "almost any kind of a slogan will
do; if the Democrats can find the proper slogan almost any
kind of a candidate will do."


[^/172]: From Chapter I of The American Party Battle, Macmillan
(1928).

Another explanation of party origins is to be found in
the writings of the English historian, Lord Macaulay. According
to his interpretation men (and presumably women)
divide naturally into two groups --- one devoted to order,
conservative in disposition, and the other devoted to progress,
adventurous in character. In short, the problem is one
in psychology.

A similar answer to the riddle was made a few years ago
by a distinguished professor of literature, Brander Matthews.
Americans, he declared, divide instinctively into
Hamiltonians and Jeffersonians. "The Hamiltonian," he said,
"believes in government by the best, by the selected leaders,
competent to guide the less competent mass; and this is true
aristocracy in the best sense of that abused word. The
Jeffersonian believes that the average man, however unenlightened,
actually knows his own business, or at least
knows what he wants, better than any superior person can
know it for him; and this is true democracy in the best
sense of that abused term. These two attitudes are inevitably
antagonistic; they are instinctive, intuitive, innate."[^/173]

Of course this is like saying: "God made Democrats and
Republicans, and that is all there is to it." When anyone
states that human actions spring from innate, inherent,
intuitive sources, he denies the force of environment and
with a final air disposes of such little questions as: "Why
are they innate? How do you know that they are innate?
Where is the proof?"

Furthermore, a detailed study of political parties, always
disconcerting to the makers of simple hypotheses, reveals
some data not easily disposed of by the literary theory of
politics. Parties in Europe do not divide into two sections:
conservative and progressive, Hamiltonian and Jeffersonian.
There we find labor parties, agrarian parties, clerical parties,
industrialist parties, Hungarian, German, Polish, and
what-not parties. A study of the early distribution of party
membership in the United States shows that the major
portion of the Hamiltonian party had its center of influence
in the cities and towns where financial, industrial, and commercial
interests were predominant. Hamilton was a New
York lawyer. Leadership in the Jeffersonian party came
from the slave-owning planters of the South. Jefferson was
a Southern planter.


[^/173]: New York Times Magazine, September 24, 1916.

How did it happen that most of the businessmen of the
country were instinctive Hamiltonians, intuitive "aristocrats,"
and most of the aristocratic planters of the South
became instinctive Jeffersonians, intuitive "democrats"?

The matter is not as simple as Brander Matthews imagined.
On about the same footing may be placed the explanation
of party divisions offered by James Bryce in his great
work, The American Commonwealth. According to his
view, the history of American parties began about 1787
when two opposing tendencies were "revealed" --- one in
favor of strengthening the central government and the
other in favor of upholding the "sovereign" rights of the
states. Broadly speaking, one party has advocated an extensive
use of federal powers and the other has opposed
that operation. Perhaps this may be called the orthodox
theory of American party differences.

To this interpretation two objections can be made. The
first is that neither party has been consistent in upholding
its creed --- particularly whenever its vital interests have been
affected. For example, the Jeffersonians used federal powers
to the limit in purchasing Louisiana, in putting an
embargo on commerce, and in enacting the fugitive slave
law of 1850 for the return of runaway property. On the
other hand, the Hamiltonians, who stretched federal powers
in establishing a bank and making protective tariffs, became
advocates of states' rights when they opposed the
purchase of Louisiana and resisted the enforcement of the
embargo.[^/174]

The second objection to the Bryce theory is that it explains
nothing. Why did some of the American people
think that the federal government should be strong and
others give their affection to the states --- that is, when upon
occasion it suited their pleasure to do so? Did this division
have a direct relation to the occupations and interests of
the people? Was it not geared up to pre-existing differences
in work and economy? As the theory stands, it merely
offers another illustrative "innate" clue to the origin of
parties.

More realistic and therefore more illuminating is the key
to party differences given in the tenth number of The
Federalist by James Madison, the "Father of the federal
Constitution" and twice President of the United States.
"The most common and durable source of factions \[that is,
in eighteenth century language, parties\]," Madison said,
"has been the various and unequal distribution of property.
Those who hold and those who are without property have
ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are
creditors and those who are debtors fall under a like
distinction. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a
mercantile interest, with many lesser interests grow up of
necessity in civilized nations and divide them into different
classes actuated by different sentiments and views. The
regulation of these various and interfering interests forms
the principal task of modern legislation and involves the
spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary
operations of government."


[^/174]: For further comment _see below_, p. 234.

In other words, the division of voters into parties according
to their political sentiments and views springs
from the possession of different kinds and amounts of
property. Illustrations of this theory may be readily recalled
by those familiar with the role of the farmer vote, the
labor vote, and the business vote in American politics.

Though realistic, this theory must not be taken too narrowly.
We are in great danger of being misled by such
words as capitalists, farmers, and laborers. Capitalists, that
is, people engaged in using money to make money, are
certainly not all occupied in identical processes. Some are
manufacturers of commodities which come into sharp competition
with European products and favor high protective
tariffs on their particular goods. Others are engaged in producing
commodities not subject to competition and may be
stanch free traders.

Again, capitalists interested in railways may be utterly
indifferent to protective tariffs because it matters little to
them whether they haul domestic or foreign freight.

A third group of capitalists are merchants who import
many of the commodities they offer for sale and may look
with pleasure upon low tariffs promising cheaper prices
and larger turnovers.

Finally, there are the financiers, the bankers, who lend
money to industries and governments, foreign and domestic,
apparently without patriotic preference, considering the
terms and security of their loans more important than national
advantages. They may be indifferent as to the schedules
in tariff bills; or they may approve low rates on imports
which facilitate the payment of interest and charges
on loans floated abroad. Indeed there is apparent now a
rift between the bankers and manufacturers of the United
States with respect to tariff policies.

Hence we may conclude that bankers, railway investors,
and importing merchants, all capitalists, might readily line
up with Democratic cotton growers of the South in support
of a low-tariff campaign, assuming that the latter did not
propose other radical measures calculated to alarm their
allies.

Nor is the case much different with regard to the "agricultural
interest." It too is divided into special interests.
The cotton growers of the South produce a staple which is
sold largely in foreign markets and they are subjected to
little competition as yet from cotton raisers in other countries.
Consequently they need no protection on their commodity
and naturally favor a low tariff on the manufactured
goods which they consume. On the other hand, the
raisers of wheat, corn, livestock, and fruits have many
formidable competitors and are generally found in the protective-tariff
lobbies when their particular commodities are
under consideration. All this is made so clear by A. N.
Holcombe in his book on The Political Parties of To-day
that comment is superfluous. One of the difficult tasks of
political managers is to work out the proper combination
that will unite the major portion of the farmers under one
political roof.

Not a whit more solid is the much vaunted "solidarity of
labor." Busily concerned with the question of wages, trade
unionists cannot be entirely oblivious to the conditions
which determine wages. Those who labor in mills heavily
protected against foreign competition may easily allow their
practical interests (supposed, at least) to outweigh their
opposition to capitalists and vote with their employers.
Again, one industry may be very prosperous while others
are in a state of depression. Miners may be starving while
railway conductors and engineers are living well and making
large deposits in their union banks.

It is also necessary to emphasize the "various and unequal
distribution of property" mentioned by Madison.
There are big and little capitalists, big and little farmers.
Some are prosperous for one reason or another. Others are
struggling along near the margin of subsistence or are
heavily in debt. Hence the capitalistic and agricultural interests
are crisscrossed by intricate lines due to "the various
and unequal distribution of property." It takes a great deal
of research and discernment to find the roots of "different
sentiments and views" in any particular political situation,
especially as it is hard to get all the pertinent data in the
case.

Additional difficulties in applying Madison's theory arise
from the fact that two persons in the same economic situation
and cherishing the same "sentiments" may differ as to
the best plan of action to advance their interests. Their
motive may be purely economic and their prejudices identical,
but their reasoning divergent. For example, two
capitalists confronted by a menacing labor agitation may
utterly disagree as to the best method for dealing with it.
One may favor calling in the police and the other urge the
expediency of conciliatory tactics.

Presumably most of the directing classes know what
their interests are, at least in detail; but they often make
wrong guesses as to policies calculated to bring advantages
to them in the long run. Moreover, as society becomes
more complicated, the difficulties of figuring up the exact
results likely to flow from particular types of action increase.
It is at this point that intelligence and information
enter into policy-determining operations. If two people of
the same economic class, seeking the same economic advantage,
disagree on methods, evidently in this case the
theory of economic interpretation breaks down; that is, it
does not explain the divergence in political view. Even the
dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia is marked by bitter
dissensions over policy. Still, though it does not by any
means exhaust the science of the subject, economics is a
fundamental branch of politics and offers the most satisfactory
clue to the origin and development of political parties.

Economics also runs into political situations which wear
racial aspects. It is a matter of common observation, for example,
that Irish-Americans are generally Democrats. A
great deal of light can be thrown on this fact by economic
history. In the beginning, the Irish who migrated to America
were extremely poor in this world's goods and settled
in the cities as laborers. For a generation or two most of
them were hewers of wood and drawers of water --- until
other races from southern and southeastern Europe came
to take their places and enabled them to move up in the
industrial scale. As laborers, the Irish were generally drawn
into the party of the masses and lined up against the
classes. On the other hand, when German migration set in
heavily the federal government was giving away land in
the West and thousands of Germans owed their farms to
the bounty of the Republicans. This debt they did not forget.

To some degree religious sentiments are connected with
economic situations. Catholic writers are fond of saying
that the Protestant revolt against the Roman Church sprang
from a lust of the rising middle class for the property of
the clergy. Undoubtedly this was a factor in a momentous
religious change. Its importance is now demonstrated in
many scientific works. To use another illustration, the
prevalence of Democratic party views among Catholics may
be, to a considerable extent, attributed to the fact that a
large proportion of the Catholics are of immigrant stock
and are to be found in or close to the laboring ranks of
American industrial society.

It is almost safe to say that, where diverse economic
interests divide groups, common religious sentiments will
not completely weld them. In other words, religious ties
are not often strong enough to bind opposing economic
interests into the same party. Protestant churches were
divided in America over slavery, the Southern branches
sustaining their "peculiar institution." Methodists and Baptists
split over tariff schedules, the regulation of railway
rates, farm relief, and other economic questions.

Confusion with respect to the roots of party differences
is darkened by the very nature of party organization. It
often happens that an institution, established for a clear
and definite object, continues after its end has been attained.
Herbert Spencer tells an amusing story of a society
founded in England for the purpose of carrying on an
agitation for a particular reform. It had its president, secretaries,
agents, paid workers, and petty officers. After a
long season of agitation, Parliament finally adopted the
reform. Shortly after the triumph, Spencer called at the
organization headquarters, expecting to find great rejoicing.
Instead he found universal sorrow. The achievement of the
purposes of the society had abolished all the lucrative jobs
which it maintained. So in politics.

A political party has offices and positions yielding gains
and profits. When in possession of the government it distributes
honors, privileges, favors, and emoluments of one
kind or another. The spoils of office alone are sufficient to
sustain a large party. Once in power and enjoying its advantages,
professional politicians are loath to lose what they
have gained. Out of power, they hesitate to espouse any
ideas that will defeat their efforts to capture the government.
Hence on both sides regular party workers often
prefer to avoid rather than to define issues, especially when
there is risk in definition. ...

### The Roots and Sources of Party Strength

Why is it that party organization has become so minute
in its ramifications and so powerful in the United States?
To answer that question adequately, one would have to explore
the structure of American society; but some of the
more obvious reasons are agreed upon and may be enumerated
here.

In the first place, the large number of elective offices
makes it impossible for the mass of the people to take an
active part in nominating candidates and running the political
machinery. Wherever elective officers are provided for,
machinery for making nominations inevitably follows. ...
Party business of necessity falls into the hands of professional
workers experienced in the art of managing
primaries and elections.

Even the very structure of our federal system makes
party government and strong party organization indispensable
if the will of the voters is to be realized. The legislative
powers are divided between Congress and the states, so
that if a party has a policy which requires federal and state
action it must be in power in both governments. ... If a
party, therefore, has a systematic and national policy covering
the important questions of our day relative to railways,
insurance, conservation ... it should be strong enough to
control state and national legislatures.

The legal separation of executive and legislative powers
serves to strengthen the political party; for democracy or
majority rule, as now understood, requires the co-ordination
of those two branches of government, and the political
party is employed to bring them into harmony with each
other. ...

Passing outward from the structure of government,
which in itself makes for strong party organization, we
encounter the "spoils system" as a contributing factor. To
some extent, of course, civil service reform has reduced
the relative number of offices to be filled by party adherents,
but there still remains an enormous number of
federal and state positions to be divided among the victors.
The political appointments subject to the President's orders
have an annual value of millions. The multiplication of the
functions of state administration has enlarged the appointing
power of the governor and the state senate. Every state
legislature has within its gift legislative offices and positions
available for partisan purposes, usually free from civil
service control. For example, there are sergeants-at-arms
and assistant sergeants-at-arms, principal doorkeepers, first
and second assistant doorkeepers, journal clerks, executive
clerks, index clerks, revision clerks, librarians, messengers,
postmasters, janitors, stenographers, and mesengers to the
various committees and assistants first and second, too
numerous to mention. Then there are city offices, high and
low, steadily multiplying in number, and, in spite of the
civil service restrictions, within the gift of the political
party that wins at the polls. Finally there are the election
officers, a veritable army of inspectors, ballot clerks, and
poll clerks for the primary and regular elections, who derive
anywhere from ten dollars to fifty dollars a year for
their services. Every large city annually pays thousands of
dollars to the officials who preside at primaries and elections.

Party machines are strengthened by huge levies on the
candidates. Generally speaking, no one can hope to be
elected to office today without being nominated by one of
the political parties. The party organization wages the
campaign which carries the candidate into office. What is
more natural and just than the demand that the candidate
shall help to pay the legitimate expenses of the campaign?
It is a regular practice, therefore, for party organizations,
state and local, to collect tribute from candidates for nomination
as well as nominees to office --- as a rule in proportion
to the value of the office they seek. There are, in
addition, levies on officeholders after election, sometimes
in spite of the laws forbidding them. Officeholders do not
always wait to be pressed by party managers in this matter.
It is not expedient.

The construction of parks, school buildings, highways,
and other public works yields revenues to the party organization
which controls the letting of contracts. High
bids may be accepted on the condition that the surplus
shall go to the party war chest or to the party leaders. The
capitol building and grounds at Albany cost New York
nearly $25,000,000, and the plunder of the public treasury
in the construction of the capitol at Harrisburg is a notorious
chapter in Pennsylvania history.

Even more important, as an economic factor, than the
spoils of office are the large funds secured by party organizations
from private interests and distributed by their
officers and workers.[^/181] Perhaps the most fruitful source of
revenue for party treasuries during recent years has been
contributions from business corporations --- even though
prohibited by law in many states. They must all apply to
the government --- national, state, or municipal --- for the
right to come into existence in the first place, and for the
right to extend their operations in the second place. They
are subject to constant regulation by municipal councils,
state legislatures, or Congress (possibly by all three agencies);
they are compelled to do things which cost them
large sums of money or abstain from doing things which
are highly profitable. In these circumstances, corporations
often find it cheap to pay party "bosses" for favors and
immunities. With a kindred concern for practical ends, industrial
concerns which thrive under protective tariffs often
"insure themselves against free trade" by contributing generously
to party war chests. Far more elusive is the collection
of party revenues in return for the protection of
gambling, liquor selling, and vice in various forms. The
extent to which this source of funds is exploited at any
time by any party is, of course, impossible to ascertain;
but authentic documents show that in the not distant past
huge sums for party war chests have come from the government
protection of those who violate its laws.


[^/181]: J. K. Pollock, Party Campaign Funds.

Sometimes the private interests affected by governmental
action give money to parties to secure favors or prevent
regulations really designed in the public interest. Sometimes
they are forced to contribute, "blackmailed," by
party leaders under threats of punitive legislation if they
do not. On many occasions, they have given money to both
the leading parties with a view to getting a "friend at
court" without fail. ...

Like a church or any other society, the political party
may be used as a social club through which a young man
or woman may make valuable acquaintances and secure
business, clients, or patients as the case may be. The social
power of the party organization enables it to intrench itself
by drawing into its ranks the best energies and talents
of young people who, though by no means devoid of
idealistic motives, cannot be blind to the stern necessities
of the struggle for existence. In some cities, it is well for
the young lawyer practicing in certain courts to be known
as a prominent worker in the party to which the presiding
judges belong. A Democratic doctor in a strongly Republican
district of a Northern city would doubtless find his rise
in the world somewhat handicapped if he were overzealous
in the support of his party, and a belligerent Republican
lawyer in a Southern city might very well find his
business limited to practice in the federal courts. The subtle
influences of party control are doubtless more powerful
than the gross influences which appear upon the surface.
...

\[Also\] contributing to party strength is the assistance
given to the voters by the \[party\] machine. Party leaders
and workers favor the poor voters by a thousand charitable
acts. They give outings, picnics, clambakes, and celebrations
for them; they help the unemployed to get work with
private corporations or in governmental departments; they
pay the rent of sick and unfortunate persons about to be
dispossessed; they appear in court for those in trouble, and
often a word to the magistrate saves the voter from the
workhouse or even worse; they remember the children at
Christmas; and, in short, they are the ever watchful charity
agents for their respective neighborhoods. A kind word
and a little money in time of pressing need often will go
further than an eloquent sermon on civic virtue. Thus
politics as it operates through party organization is a serious
and desperately determined business activity; it works
night and day; it is patient; it gets what it can; it never
relaxes.
