## The Upheaval[^/235]

... \[Slowly\] through the decades, as we have just seen, a
left-wing agrarian movement gathered strength; finally, in
1896, it overwhelmed the Democratic party and split the
Republicans.

### The Democratic Platform of 1896

Neither in principles nor in language did the Democratic
platform of that year depart essentially from the
traditions set by the agrarians in the days of Jackson, although,
of course, new times had brought new devices for
conquering the party of "wealth and talents." As of old,
the currency question, with all its implications for the
distribution of wealth, was a central issue of the battle.
This time, however, the agrarian remedy was not more
paper money issued by state banks, but an increase in the
volume of the currency to be effected by the free coinage
of silver on a ratio of sixteen units to one of gold. The
practical purpose was the same, namely, to make it easier
for debtors to pay and at the same time raise the price of
farm produce.

In dealing with the second historic question, namely,
the United States banking system, the Democratic platform
of 1896 cited specifically the language of Andrew Jackson
and denounced the issuance of notes by national banks as
undesirable and unconstitutional. This was true to form.

Equally direct was the plank on protection for American
industries: "We hold that tariff duties should be levied
for purposes of revenue ... and not discriminate between
class or section." John C. Calhoun could not have
been more explicit.


[^/235]: From Chapter VII of The American Party Battle, Macmillan
(1928).

An income tax was endorsed "to the end that wealth
may bear its due proportion of the expenses of the Government."
Besides levying on great riches, such a tax would
afford revenue to make up for the reduction of protective
duties on goods consumed by the masses.

Returning to a tradition temporarily weakened during
their long tenure of power in the Middle Period, the
Democrats in 1896 assailed the federal judiciary, this time
for declaring null and void the income tax law of 1894. ...

And what did labor --- that other "humble order of society"
dear to Andrew Jackson's heart --- receive at the
hands of the Democracy rampant? A plank denouncing the
use of injunctions in industrial disputes and approving
"trials by jury in certain cases of contempt."

Having made a platform in harmony with the traditions
of the left wing, the Democrats proceeded to nominate
William Jennings Bryan, aptly called "the Tiberius Gracchus
of the West." There could be no doubt about his position
with reference to the century-old battle. In his famous
"Crown of Thorns \[or "Cross of Gold\] Speech" he
placed himself on the side of the wage earner, the country
lawyer, the crossroads merchant, the farmer, and the
miner. He expressly named them as his friends and exclaimed:
"It is for these that we speak." The great question,
as he saw it, was: "Upon which side shall the Democratic
party fight? Upon the side of the idle holders of
idle capital, or upon the side of the struggling masses?
... The sympathies of the Democratic party, as described
by the platform, are on the side of the struggling masses,
who have ever been the foundation of the Democratic
party." No line could have been more clearly drawn.

On such principles, Bryan appealed to the country in
1896 and again in 1900, only to go down to defeat before
William McKinley, a statesman of the Hamilton--Webster
school. Again, in 1908, after attempting a conservative
tack to the right under Alton B. Parker in 1904, the
Democrats swung back to Bryan, adopted a platform even
more aggressive in tone, and were vanquished once more
at the polls.

### The Republican Program

On their side of the line, the Republicans were loyal
to the Hamilton-Webster-Seward heritage. In not a single
relation did they depart from the traditions of a hundred
years.

In Hamilton's creed, protection for American industries
was a leading article. On coming to power in 1897, the
Republicans enacted the Dingley tariff bill which carried
the duties, on the average, to a new high level. There were
compromises in it, of course, but in the main manufacturers
were delighted with it.

Of equal importance in the Hamilton creed were banking
and currency. The Whigs and their successors in interest,
the Republicans, knew this quite well. Having won
a great victory over the easy-money party in 1896, Republicans
proceeded as fast as circumstances would allow
to give attention to that issue. To solidify the currency they
enacted the gold-standard law of 1900, and, under the
leadership of Senator Aldrich of Rhode Island, were preparing
to revise the whole banking system, when they were
ousted from power once more.

Especially did the Republicans attend to the development
of the trading empire which Federalist legislation had
favored, Webster had promoted, and Seward had advanced.
In McKinley's first administration, they annexed
the Hawaiian Islands, waged war on Spain, made Cuba a
protectorate, added Porto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines
to the American empire, and united with foreign powers in
upholding their rights in China. Victorious every time the
Democrats assailed them for "imperialism," the Republicans
not unnaturally looked upon themselves as commissioned
by the people to exploit the resources added to the
country by arms and diplomacy.

### The Rise of Progressivism

Underneath the prosperity so vaunted in the age of the
full dinner pail, rumblings of discontent on the left wing
could be heard. ... Although the makers of unrest, or
the spokesmen of it, differed among themselves as to their
remedies, they were all united in waging war on what they
were fond of calling "government by a plutocracy." With
some variations, they demanded an inflation of the currency
either by the free coinage of silver or some form of
paper, graduated income and inheritance taxes, a reduction
of the tariff on goods consumed by the masses, stricter
regulation of railways and trusts to cut down their revenues,
aid to farmers in the shape of loans at low rates of interest,
and laws designed to improve the status of industrial
workers.

When the prosperity that followed the Spanish War
declined, the agitations of the socialists and the agrarians
became more vigorous than ever. After the enactment of
the tariff law of 1909, the discontent of Western farmers
began to make marked inroads upon the apparent solidarity
of the Republican party. Indeed, a rift in that party had
been in process since the accession of Theodore Roosevelt
to the Presidency in 1901, for he soon aroused the distrust
of the capitalistic wing by appealing to the populistic sentiments
cherished in the agrarian wing. ... He advocated
income and inheritance taxes partly with a view to helping
equalize fortunes; he recommended a stricter federal control
of business corporations; and he advocated a few
measures for the benefit of the working classes.

Discovering that his successor, President Taft, supported
the conservative wing of the Republican party in Congress,
Roosevelt, on the appeal of many followers, sought the
Republican nomination at Chicago in 1912. Failing to
secure it, he and a large portion of his adherents "bolted"
and formed a new party, taking the name of "Progressive."

Encouraged by the split in the Republican ranks, the
Democrats entered the campaign with great confidence, led
by Governor Woodrow Wilson as their candidate. The conservatism
of Cleveland and Parker they definitely abandoned.

Now, for the first time since its formation, the Republican
party was confronted by an overwhelming combination
that threatened it in the language of populism. The Progressive
platform, on which Roosevelt ran for President,
declared that both the old parties had become "tools of
corrupt interests" and that "to dissolve the unholy alliance
between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first
task of the statesmanship of the day." The Democratic
candidate asserted in similar language that "the government
of the United States at present is a foster child of
the special interests," meaning thereby "the big bankers,
the big manufacturers, the big masters of commerce, the
heads of railroad corporations and of steamship corporations."

As the Republican party was shattered by the Progressive
defection, Wilson was easily elected President, although his
popular vote was more than two million below the total poll
of the opposing candidates.

Within a little more than a year after Wilson's inauguration,
the European war broke in upon the peace of the
world. American industry and agriculture were made prosperous
again by the extraordinary demands of the European
belligerents, especially the Entente powers. Social questions
which had emerged in 1912 were thrust into the background,
and the campaign of 1916, waged while the war
was still raging, naturally took on the color of that conflict.
... Rejecting Progressive overtures, the Republicans selected
as their standard-bearer Justice Charles E. Hughes.
... In their platform, the Republicans favored maintaining
"a straight and honest neutrality between the belligerents
in Europe" and the protection of American rights. The
Democrats renominated President Wilson and based their
appeal mainly on his record of achievement and on the fact
that he had kept us out of war.

### The Program of the New Freedom

Although the clangor of the European war made more
headlines for the newspapers, as a matter of fact there was
enacted during the eight years of President Wilson's administration
the most remarkable program of legislation
passed since the Civil War. And it is to be noted that this
legislation merely expressed in legal letter the spirit of the
Democratic platform of 1912.

In the third paragraph, that platform declared that "the
high Republican tariff is the principal cause of the unequal
distribution of wealth; it is a system of taxation which
makes the rich richer and the poor poorer; under its operations
the American farmer and laboring man are the chief
sufferers." Jacksonian Democracy was never more precise.
The platform also condemned the "so-called Aldrich bill or
the establishment of a central bank" and advocated "such
a systematic revision of our banking laws as will render
temporary relief in localities where such relief is needed,
with protection from control or domination by what is
known as the 'money trust."" It asserted that "of equal
importance with the question of currency reform is the
question of rural credits or agricultural finance." The
suppression of "gambling in agricultural products by organized
exchanges and others" was also promised as a
part of a program "to improve the conditions of trade in
farm products." Recalling the previous pledges of the party
to organized labor, it promised trial by jury in cases of indirect
contempt and the relief of trade unions from prosecution
as illegal combinations in restraint of trade.

With a fidelity to promises not always observed in American
politics, the Democrats under the leadership of President
Wilson passed a series of laws that squared fairly well
with the historic principles of the Jefferson-Jackson-Bryan
heritage.

First of all, the tariff was materially reduced in 1913----
for the first time since 1857--- and in the revision agricultural
interests received a consideration which was more
than friendly.

Currency and banking questions were attacked in the
Federal Reserve Act. As if to recall the tussle of Jackson
with an independent corporation, this Act put the control
of the new banking system in the hands of a political board
appointed entirely by the President and Senate. Bryan had
declared that gold was too narrow a basis for the currency:
the Federal Reserve Act provided for the issue of
money on prime commercial paper --- in practical operation
going far beyond the gold foundation. Bryan had been accused
of demanding a fifty-cent dollar for debtors and
farmers: the country lived to see a dollar worth less than
fifty cents in the market place. Jacksonian Democracy had
feared a centralized "money power": the Federal Reserve
Act attempted to distribute that power throughout the
whole country by creating twelve separate banking districts.

In keeping with their professions, the Democrats, while
framing their revenue program, resorted to the income tax
--- that old device of the Populists, now made constitutional
by the Sixteenth Amendment. To render it quite palatable
to the left wing, they placed the exemptions at a good
figure and made it progressive, increasing the rates as
riches mounted upward. Under the financial stress of the
World War, the income tax, individual and corporate, rose
to percentages in the higher brackets that fairly staggered
the possessors of great fortunes. Besides being besieged to
give to war charities "until it hurts," they were compelled
to pay taxes until it caused positive anguish of spirit and a
serious depletion of purse. Nothing like it had occurred
during the Republican administration of the Civil War.

"Big Business," so called --- the concentration of "wealth
and talents" --- was attacked by the Clayton Anti-Trust Act
of 1914, designed to break up monopolistic undertakings
and force price reductions by competition. In line with
this measure was another law creating the Federal Trade
Commission and endowing it with power to force the
adoption of "fair practices" by business concerns in various
relations.

Besides the pleasures and advantages conferred by these
laws, such as they were, farmers and planters received aid
through the Farm Loan Act which enabled them to keep
money in their pockets by borrowing at a lower rate of
interest than had been customary, especially in the West
and South.

Labor, that powerful ally of Jacksonian Democracy, was
not forgotten in the program of the New Freedom. It
secured so many lines in the Clayton Anti-Trust Act that
Samuel Gompers called the law "The Magna Carta of
Labor." It is true that most of the gifts turned to ashes in
the fire of judicial interpretation, but labor did not blame
the Democratic party for this untoward outcome of its efforts
on behalf of the "plain people."

If, as may be surmised, this program of laws did not restore
farmers, planters, and mechanics to the position they
had enjoyed in the days of Andrew Jackson, it certainly
was conceived with reference to their state of mind rather
than to the "special interests" so vigorously attacked by
Wilson in his presidential campaign. Without question,
there would have been a square alignment on this legislation
in 1916 if the World War --- so profitable to both
American business and agriculture --- had not intervened
and obscured somewhat the ancient political division. If
there was any doubt on this point at the time, it must have
been cleared in the very first presidential campaign waged
after the conclusion of the War.

In the sphere of imperial and foreign affairs, the Democrats
certainly made movements in the direction of retrenchment.
Their platform of 1900 denounced the "greedy
commercialism which dictated the Philippine policy of the
Republican administration ... and the war of 'criminal
aggression' against the Filipinos." "We assert," ran the
document, "that no nation can long endure half republic
and half empire, and we warn the American people that
imperialism abroad will lead quickly and inevitably to
despotism at home."

True to their tradition, the Democrats did not oppose
expansion, "when it takes in desirable territory which can
be erected into states in the Union and whose people are
willing and fit to become American citizens." But they
were against the imperialism of commerce --- \[the\] absorbing
\[of\] subject races and the development of trade and investment
opportunities through military power. Again and
again, the Democrats repeated this profession of faith. In
1912, for example, they declared: "We condemn the experiment
in imperialism as an inexcusable blunder."

When in a position to give effect to their creed, the
Democrats naturally spoke more softly, but they did not
overlook their pledges. They gave more self-government to
Porto Rico and the Philippines, promising the latter independence
sometime in the future. In dealing with the Far
East, President Wilson looked coldly upon the devices of
"vigorous diplomacy." He at first declined to lend his
sanction to projects of international bankers, known as the
consortium, for lending money to China and introducing a
certain administrative control over her finances. He refused
to utter any threats against Japan, even when she
made the "twenty-one demands" upon China, and he so
neglected American interests in the latter country that his
own minister at Peking threw up his office in disgust.

Nearer home, however, especially in the Caribbean,
President Wilson continued the strong policy which had
been inaugurated under Republican auspices. It is true, he
promised the Latin Americans freedom from intervention
on behalf of economic interests in the United States but
for one reason or another was unable to carry out his
pledges.

Nevertheless, when he entered the World War, he condemned
imperialism in terms almost savage and at the
Paris peace table he sought no material advantages for the
United States in the distribution of the spoils of victory.
Moreover, he proposed a League of Nations which seemed
to threaten some kind of international control over undeveloped
races, some limitations on the exploitation of
the backward countries by powerful peoples, and the possible
interference of a super-state with the ordinary processes
of imperial expansion. At all events, statesmen of the
McKinley school did not believe that Wilsonian doctrines
expressed in the League Covenant squared with the traditions
which their party had followed since the days of
Webster and Seward.
