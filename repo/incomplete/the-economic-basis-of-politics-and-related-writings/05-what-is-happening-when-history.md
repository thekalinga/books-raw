## What Is Happening When History Is Being Written?[^/25]

... All individuals do, certainly, come upon many
facts by direct contact as life proceeds --- in industry, labor,
enterprise, and social intercourse --- without looking for
them purposefully. ... \[The historian, however,\] can
observe only a few of them at first hand. ... \[The\] major
portion of facts employed in the discussion of human
affairs in any comprehensive way are not facts that come
more or less fortuitously into the range of direct observation.
... Unlike the physicist or chemist, the historian
is not a personal observer of events that lie beyond
his own time. He cannot see historical occurrences with
his own eyes, as the chemist sees compounds in his test
tubes and retorts. The historian must "see" the actuality
of history through the medium of records, documents,
memoirs, papers, and monuments. That is his sole recourse
for the events beyond his own time. ... Such sources are
multitudinous. They vary in correctness of statement, reporting,
and authenticity. ...

\[In the presence of these sources, almost\] any literate
person can write some history, of a kind, can tell a story,
compile a narrative, describe an adventure. While no one
would think of writing seriously on physics or chemistry
without preliminary training, there is nothing to estop the
merest amateur from taking a few documents, letters, and
memoirs, and preparing "a history" of this or that, without
fear and without thought. Indeed scholars who devote a
lifetime to the critical analysis of historical sources frequently
write huge works on history without ever asking
themselves just what they are doing. Accordingly, there is
some reason for treating written history lightly, as dull,
unilluminating, and meaningless for life --- for practical affairs.


[^/25]: From The Discussion of Human Affairs, The Macmillan
Co. (1936).

But the scope and achievements of historical writing
must not be judged by random examples. ... \[History\]
must be judged by the more critical and comprehensive
thought that has been given to the subject.

Doubtless it would be startling news to the overwhelming
majority of those who take part in discussing human affairs
to learn that there exists in the field of historiography a
body of highly technical literature dealing with the subject:
"What is history?" It is not to be read casually by
laymen any more than the technical literature on higher
physics.

None of these works on historiography, to be sure, is as
exact as an engineer's handbook on highway construction,
and for this reason some men of natural science are inclined
to ascribe to historians a lack of the power to
analyze, establish fixed sequences, and disclose laws. In
other words, historians suffer from some deficiency of
mental capacity. Yet other reasons may account for their
difficulties, especially the complexity of their subject, the
paucity of the data available, and the intricate problems
of thought involved. After all, physics, complex as it may
be, is relatively simple as compared to a subject which
includes physicists and physics, and everything else mankind
has said and done on earth since it began its
checkered career here. ...

Yet heroic efforts have been made by competent thinkers
to answer the question: What are we doing when we are
writing history --- selecting and organizing facts of history?
They have not succeeded in making a final answer, but
they have produced an immense amount of fairly exact
knowledge pertaining to it. To run through a few thousand
pages of this analytical and critical literature is a lesson in
humility for those who fain would discourse sagely on
human affairs.

There was a time, in the proud age of scientific assurance,
when many historians imagined that "the scientific
method" enabled them to describe history as it actually
was. Leopold von Ranke, the founder of this school, introduced
the idea that history could be written as it actually
had been (Wie es eigentlich gewesen ist).

How was this feat to be accomplished? The documents,
letters, memoirs, papers, and monuments of the period or
nation chosen were to be assembled, scrutinized for authenticity,
collated, sifted, and checked. The historian was
to divest himself of all religious, political, philosophical,
social, economic, sex, moral, and esthetic interests, and
from the "sources" describe personalities and events as
they had been in reality.

... Under the spell of this idea an enormous amount
of invaluable work was done in history. The collection
and preservation of historical sources were stimulated and
made systematic. An immense body of exact knowledge
concerning past personalities and events was accumulated.
Every phase of history was illuminated by recourse to
authentic evidence. A thousand historical myths and rumors
were exploded, as in the field of exact science.
History written for purposes obviously partisan was discredited,
and made suspect among adepts, if not among
readers at large. As a result the twentieth century possesses
far more precise and authentic knowledge of the past than
did the eighteenth century.

As work was carried forward under this ideal, some
historians cherished the hope that by the scientific method
the laws of history could be revealed, and history as actuality
reduced to an exact science. Near the end of the
nineteenth century, Henry Adams declared that every historical
scholar with high ambition thought that he almost
had the science "in his inkstand."

About that time the dream exploded. ... Criticism
was turned upon critical history. The result was a series of
conclusions which may be summarized in the following
manner:

... The materials from which the historian must derive
his knowledge cover merely a portion of the events and
personalities in question. In other words, most of them
escaped recording. ... \[Moreover,\] pages and volumes
have disappeared amid the ravages of time. ... Concerning
the nature of the unrecorded \[or permanently lost\]
no knowledge is available or ever can be available.

... Not only are the records partial at the outset. In
very few cases can the historian be sure that he has assembled
all the existing records that pertain to the age,
theme, or period with which he is concerned. As a rule he
makes a partial selection from the incomplete records of
the events and personalities involved in the actuality which
he is attempting to describe.

... Since the actual history of any period embraces all
the events and personalities and since the records of these
events and personalities are scanty at best, it follows that
the total actuality of the period cannot be known, can
never be known, no matter how zealous and laborious the
historical searcher.

... Since the known or knowable facts relative to
any large period and to world history run into the millions,
if not billions, it follows that any written history is a selection
and organization of facts --- a selection and organization
made by a given person at a given time and place.

... Although many relationships among past events
and personalities, immediate, proximate, and remote, have
been established by historical research, paucity of knowledge,
for reasons cited, does not permit the attainment of
an exact and complete structure of relationships, if indeed
such be assumed to have existed.

... Into the selection of topics, the choice and arrangement
of facts, the historian's "me" will enter, no matter
what efforts he makes to be neutral. He cannot be otherwise
than he is. This "me" will enter with a conscious clarification
of philosophy and purpose or, as Croce says, surreptitiously,
without confession, knowledge, and acknowledgement.
The philosophy may be grand and universal in
its reach, or small, provincial, class, and national in form
and nature. ...

How could it be otherwise? When he is mature enough
to begin work, the historian has already gathered impressions
and conceptions in the process of study and experience
--- rearing and training in some place or places, and
social order. If it be said that the historian may put out of
mind all conceptions, then the question arises: By what
criteria does he choose a theme to be studied or select
facts from among the millions or billions available?

The proposition seems inescapable: some conception or
assumption respecting the nature of all things exists in the
historian's mind and acts more or less as a controlling force
in the selection of facts, in the creation of what purports
to be descriptions of past situations in development. Such,
at least, is the conclusion at which contemporary historiography
has arrived. Whoever challenges it is called upon
to produce counterevidence as powerful as that upon which
it now rests.

Having reached the conclusion that some conception of
the nature of things controls the selection and organization
of recorded facts into written history, contemporary historians
inquire: What conceptions that have been employed
in the past are now available to us?

Long and patient analysis of written discussions of human
affairs, whether professedly historical or economic or
political or cultural, has disclosed numerous conceptions.
But these have been reduced to a small number, each enclosing
turns or nuances of its own. The following, if not
all-embracing, are now deemed primary in Western usage.

1. The Jewish--Christian conception of the world and
   mankind, with history as a kind of divine drama in which
   God's will or providence is revealed or illustrated by personalities and events. The conflicts, antagonisms, and oppositions of real life are to be explained by reference to
   some divine overruling purpose --- a synthesis that reconciles them in one all-embracing totality.

History of this type is now seldom written in its pure
form, even by Jewish, Protestant, or Catholic writers. The
problems and difficulties involved in assigning such matters
as the outcome of the last presidential election or the last
war to divine plan and will make the cautious hesitate. Just
what place did the election of Herbert Hoover and the
defeat of Alfred E. Smith in 1928 occupy in God's providence?
... Just what position in the drama of the West's
God is to be assigned to peoples that never heard of it or
Him? ...

2. The second conception of the nature of human affairs
   is that of man as Homo sapiens, without reference to any
   divine origins or purposes. This conception takes man as
   he seems to be, a more or less rational animal whose history consists of thought and activities in relation to human
   purposes. In fact, and to some extent in theory, it discards
   all efforts to relate human conduct to an overarching divine
   scheme. It seeks to "explain" history in terms of human
   intelligence used in the attainment of human ends.

In application this conception also encounters difficulties.
... Innumerable activities ranging from individual deeds
to mass conflicts and wars often seem to spring from distempers
wholly irrational, ... and even when activities
are directed ostensibly to ends they are as likely as not to
be utterly defeated, either immediately or in the long run.

3. Equally earthy but more special is the third conception
   of history founded on the idea of homo faber-men and
   women busy continuing biological life, sustaining it, and
   doing innumerable things, often without respect to clear
   ends, perhaps for the pleasure or pain of doing them. ...

The difficulties of applying the conception of homo
faber are not immediate. In fact we have large bodies of
literature --- anthropological and historical --- which do describe
with a high degree of accuracy particular behaviors
and types of behavior. But apparently insuperable obstacles
appear when efforts are made to "explain" such behaviors
and types and to relate them to the surrounding totality of
history in development. ...

Among the variations is the still more specialized conception
of homo economicus, employed by such writers as
Adam Smith and Karl Marx; human beings ... rational
enough to know and attain economic interests and ends.
Indeed it may be justly said that homo economicus implies
Homo sapiens. ...

The theory of homo economicus is more effective in
"explaining" particular institutions and events. But it is
baffled in many places by the fact that a considerable portion
of human ideas and activities, if conditioned by economic
practices, seem not to arise out of economic interests
and to have only a remote, if any, relation to such
concerns. It encounters the same troubles as the theory of
Homo sapiens; human beings do not always know their
economic interests and constantly engage in activities that
are adverse to these interests.

4. In efforts to escape some of the dilemmas presented
   by other conceptions, or without employing much thought
   at all, a few writers have introduced the Superman, a kind
   of deus ex machina, that "makes history." The history of
   the world, says Carlyle, is at bottom merely the history of
   the great men who have worked here. Heroes are everything; masses, despite all their interests, activities, ideas,
   and distempers, are as nothing, save pawns in the game of
   heroes. The past history of masses may be ignored; it
   neither conditions nor determines the work which the hero,
   the captain, the leader, the dictator, does. The leader creates the myth; the masses goose-step into line and obey
   the hero's will.

Although this conception denies the inevitability of
things as created by centuries of past thought and practice,
there is some element of truth in it. For example, the
liberal conception of democracy and the Marxian conception
of social democracy made headway in Europe between
1789 and 1920 and seemed to present signs of inevitable
advance. Yet Mussolini in Italy and Hitler in
Germany reversed the whole trend, for the time being at
least, by raising up symbols and organizing force as force.

Nevertheless they did not work in a vacuum, and it must
be admitted that certain conditions of life and labor in
Italy and Germany favored their designs. Their rise to
power was conditioned and their exercise of power is still
conditioned \[1936\], in part determined, by the operations
of the economic system and by their relations to other
countries over which their power does not \[1936\] extend.
The Superman theory does not correspond to reality.

It also encounters contradictions in its emphasis on masculinity.
It fails to reckon with "the women of the Cæsars,"
and such women as Joan of Arc, Elizabeth of England,
Catherine of Russia, and Maria Theresa of Austria. It can
only escape this dilemma by saying that they were more
masculine than feminine, which opens the door for declaring
that the bodily forms of sex do not in fact mark
men as men or women as women. If that is maintained,
then how do we know that the Superman is not merely
the embodiment of "feminine force and intuition," denying
the rationality of history?

There is something in the power of "great" personalities,
but to found a theory of history on it is to deny the demonstrated
existence of surrounding circumstances which
condition and/or determine the conduct of leaders, heroes,
and dictators. They can scarcely be regarded as independent
gods operating under their own will and creating the
world in their image, unless we throw overboard all that is
known about masses, institutions, continuing traditions,
and changing economies.

5. Stemming out of the conception of homo economicus, and of the Superman, is the class conception of
   history. All history is the history of class struggles and the
   leader is a class hero. Each class has its interests, its conceptions of itself and history, its myths, and its symbolic
   figures. There is no such thing as "general" interests or
   "general" history. Everything is enclosed in classes and
   their conflicts.

All we can have then is the theory of a particular class ---
the Prussian Junker, the British aristocracy, the freehold
peasant or farmer, the petty capitalist, the great finance
capitalist, or the industrial worker possessing little or no
property. Theories of society, economics, politics, history,
and literature are class theories.[^/32]

This conception of history is very old and very persistent.
Many of the world's great secular thinkers have entertained
it in some form --- Aristotle, Polybius, Harrington,
Locke, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, Daniel Webster,
and Karl Marx, for example. It has behind it the
weight of high authority and the testimony of many historic
struggles. That it comes into close correspondence
with many known and established realities cannot be
denied by historians of competence.

More than two thousand years ago, Aristotle made a
close study of Greek history, society, politics, government,
and culture. Out of his researches and personal experience,
he came to three basic conclusions: (1) the conflicts that
shake society and make history turn on the pursuit of interests
by classes in society. (2) There are two broad theories
of society, namely, individualism and communism, and
all other theories are modifications of these opposites. (3)
Since society itself implies more than a mere aggregation of
individuals, the eternal question is: What goods shall be
community goods and to what extent shall obligations be
imposed on the use of individual goods?


[^/32]: Compiler's note: Beard does not here point to the shortcomings
of the class conception of history, but its limitations.
are indicated in quotations made later from another of his
works. See Chapter VII of the present volume.

6. Wider than any other positive formulations of history,
   and not necessarily in direct conflict with the other conceptions, is the idea of progress.[^/33] According to this hypothesis, humanity in its long and zigzag march from barbarism is conquering its environment and itself, and may
   make the nobler aspirations of mankind prevail over material circumstances and the passions of acquisitive conflict. This is both an interpretation of the past and a projection for the future.

The application of the idea of progress to history as
actuality has been mercilessly attacked, often by critics not
familiar with its most rigid formulations. This is no place
to review the criticisms or consider their validity. It is
sufficient to say that the proponents of the idea have
emerged with two contentions: (1) unless all history is a
senseless faux pas, some advances have been made, if painfully,
since the stone age; and (2) if there has been no
progress in the past, mankind by awareness and by taking
thought can make it in the future.

In any case the idea is not easily disposed of completely.
Whatever goal may be set up for the future, it is reasonably
certain that it will not be attained overnight. The achievement
will take time and will involve innumerable events
and personalities --- stages in development. Hence it will be
in the nature of progress. Unless we assume chaos and
meaninglessness in the time unfoldment of human affairs,
unless we accept the present state of things as perfection,
we seem bound to accept progress of some kind in some
form. And from past experience we may infer that at no
time in the future will the movement of ideas and interests,
which is history as actuality, cease. In other words there
are grounds for inferring that history will not be closed
at any given date in the future by some unchangeable and
unchanging utopia of perfection or a disaster of dissolution.

... \[If the selection and arrangement of facts, and the
"deductions" made from them, often represent opinion,
and to this are added the frank opinions of the writers,
then many\] if not most of the statements appearing in discussions
of human affairs are at bottom simply expressions
of opinions advanced by the proponents. Even when having
the garb of profundity and decorated by numerous citations
of fact, true or alleged, they are merely assertions of
things cherished by the writer or speaker --- his good wishes
or good will. ... Hence we seem driven to the conclusion
that all general discussions of human affairs are in truth
assertions of opinions, good, bad, and indifferent. ...


[^/33]: J. B. Bury, The Idea of Progress. American edition with an
Introduction by Charles A. Beard.

One truth rising above the conflicts and distempers of
time does emerge, and it is a truth important for practice.
This truth may be formulated as follows: it is possible for
all who discuss human affairs to distinguish somewhat effectively
between fact and opinion and to have extensive
knowledge of the various positions or points of view (tacit
or admitted) from which any expression of opinion proceeds
or takes direction. As knowledge of these positions
or points of view is widened by persistent inquiry, their
overlapping or interpenetrating nature enters into human
consciousness, with the result that sharpness of division is
softened and the way prepared for resolving conflicts by
the magic of thought projected into the forum of practice.
For whatever it is worth, this is the supreme contribution
of contemporary historiography to the process of coping
with present perplexities and making a civilization in which
humanity can possess the beautiful and the good.
