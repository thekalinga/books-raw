## The Growth of Dissent[^/231]

Although the two historic parties commanded the allegiance
of the mass of the people during the period just
reviewed, there was always a dissenting element in each of
them. In fact, every party is a more or less miscellaneous
aggregation with a conservative right and a radical left,
shading off into each other by imperceptible degrees. If a
citizen does not approve the policies adopted by the party
with which he is associated by birth or temper, he has three
choices before him. He can stay within the party and work
to secure the nomination of other men and the declaration
of other principles. He can go over to another party which
more nearly represents his idea about politics. Or he may
leave his party and join others who are of a like mind in
forming a new organization. Since the candidates and
platforms of the major parties usually represent the middle
average, the person of extreme views is likely to be disgruntled
with them, especially in times when changing
circumstances call for sweeping political adjustments. ...

Naturally, the new conditions of American life forced
to the front appropriate doctrines. As far as they involved
radical changes, these doctrines usually found their first
exponents in minor parties; and as the respective issues
came within the range of practical politics, they were
presented to the country in national campaigns by one or
both of the two great parties. Accordingly, it is necessary
to review briefly the minor parties since the Civil War,
for, in spite of their apparent insignificance, they have been
important factors in the American governing process.
These parties fall readily into three groups: temperance,
labor, and agrarian.

### The Prohibitionists

About the middle of the nineteenth century there arose
a temperance movement which carried several states for
absolute prohibition. A reaction, however, speedily set in,
and the temperance question was overshadowed by the
great slavery issue. After the Civil War, prohibitionists
appeared once more upon the political scene. At a convention
... in 1872, they nominated a presidential candidate
and launched a national party. ... \[Their\] influence
exceeded their numerical strength. Moreover, the
idea of prohibition was taken up by leaders in the old
parties. ... In the course of time, hundreds of localities
and two-thirds of the states were made "dry" by referendum
after referendum; finally the prohibition of intoxicating
liquor as a beverage throughout the United States
was incorporated in the Eighteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, put into effect in January, 1920. ...

### Labor and Socialism

Almost immediately after the Civil War, labor entered
American politics as a separate and independent element.
In 1872, a party known as the Labor Reformers held a
national convention in Columbus, Ohio. ... At that convention,
the party declared in favor of Chinese exclusion,
an eight-hour day in government employments, civil-service
reform, one term for the President, restricting the sale
of public lands to bona-fide homeseekers, the regulation of
railway and telegraph rates, and the subjection of the
military to civil authority.

For a time, the labor element seems to have been absorbed
into the agrarian groups ... but in 1888 a Union
Labor party met in a national convention. ... Although
the American Federation of Labor was organized under
its present name about this time, namely in 1886, it lent
no countenance to the idea of a separate labor party.

An avowed socialist organization appeared on the national
stage in the campaign of 1892, when the Socialist
Labor party held its first national convention in New York.
This party made its appeal almost exclusively to the
working class. ...

Internal dissensions and the extreme views of the Socialist
Labor leaders led to the organization of another
radical group, known as the Socialist party, which held its
first convention in 1900. At the presidential election of
1908 it polled 448,453 votes. ... Four years later its
vote rose almost to a million, and exerted a decided influence
on the two major parties. ... Though fairly
united on domestic policy, the Socialist party split on foreign
issues. ... Extremists on the left wing, the Workers'
party, declared in favor of communism, nominated a candidate,
and polled about 36,000 votes in that year. ...

### Left-wing Agrarianism

Not long after the Civil War, a distinctly agrarian party,
professing the principles of left-wing Democracy, challenged
the right of the major parties to rule. With the rapid
decline in the prices of agricultural produce, which accompanied
the general collapse of the inflated war prices,
the farmers began to grow bitter over their lot and to
organize societies, known as granges. At length they came
to believe that the railways, the corporations, and the
financial policy of the federal government were principally
responsible for the evils under which they labored. Working
through the legislatures, especially in Illinois, Iowa,
Wisconsin, and other Western states, they attempted to
secure relief by means of laws regulating railway rates and
warehousing.

In 1876, the discontented farmers entered politics as the
Independent National, or "Greenback," party, and waged
warfare especially on the Republicans, whom they charged
with having brought about the decline in prices by placing
the monetary system on a specie basis and contracting the
currency. ...

Although it gained in votes at first, the Greenback
party went to pieces completely after the campaign of 1884. Within a short time, however, restless agrarians
formed a new association, known as the Farmers' Alliance,
which, although it did not officially enter politics,
was instrumental in creating the Populist party. This party
drew together, in 1892, both agrarian and labor elements.
At a national convention in Omaha, it put forth a radical
program, demanding government ownership of railway,
telegraph, and telephone lines, a graduated income tax,
postal savings banks, and the free coinage of silver and
gold at the legal ratio of 16 to 1.

On this platform the Populists went into the campaign
of 1892, and polled more than a million votes, principally
in the Western and Southern states. ... Indeed, in 1896,
the Populistic wing of the Democratic party captured the
organization and tested its principles in the memorable
campaign of that year. ...
