## National Republican (Whig)-Democratic Alignment[^/200]

### The Changing Economic Order

DURING the long years of Republican supremacy, certain
fundamental economic changes occurred which strengthened
the left wing of that party. These great changes were
connected with the settlement of the Northwest Territory,
the extension of cotton culture into the Southwest, and the
revolution wrought in Eastern industry by machinery.

In the process, the balance of power was shifted from
the seaboard states to the West. Kentucky was admitted to
the Union in 1792, Tennessee in 1796, Ohio in 1803, Louisiana
in 1812, Indiana in 1816, Illinois in 1818, Mississippi
in 1817, Alabama in 1819, and Missouri in 1821.

In these Western states there arose a type of economic
society such as had never before appeared in the history of
the world, at least on a large scale. A vast region was
settled by hardy and restless pioneers who crossed the
mountains, cut down the forests, built houses, and founded
homes. In the possession of this world's goods they were,
for the most part, substantially equal; it was easy to acquire
land; any thrifty and industrious farmer with his family
could readily secure the comforts of a rude but healthful
and independent life. Practically every white man could
vote. In the log cabins were developed political ideas fundamentally
different from those entertained by the rich
merchants of the East or the aristocratic landholders in
the manors along the Hudson.

In the West, the leveling theories of Jefferson were fairly
realized. Owing to the simple life which farmers lived,
government was to them a simple thing; anyone could hold
the office of sheriff, county clerk, road supervisor, state
auditor, or governor. Since the duties of the offices were
easily understood and the emoluments connected with them
attractive, especially to men who earned their bread with
the ax and the plow, the Western settlers seized with eagerness
upon the doctrine of short terms and rotation in office.

Needing capital to develop their resources and provide
means of transportation, these Western people were always
borrowers in the money market. Of necessity, they had to
depend largely upon Eastern financiers for credits and,
being far from the center of business, they had to pay high
rates of interest on their loans. In the best of times they
were hard driven and during depressions they were plunged
into distress. Naturally they sought a remedy for their
difficulties and came to the conclusion that it consisted in
currency inflation --- perhaps through the agency of state
banks empowered to issue bills of credit. By such a device
they hoped to pay their debts more easily and to command
a higher price for their produce --- economic operations
which threw them into opposition to creditors and buyers.

No less significant for politics than the development of
the West was an economic revolution in the agricultural
system of the South created by invention of textile machinery
and the cotton gin. With the extraordinary demand
for cotton came a demand for more land to cultivate and
more slaves for labor. The slave population now rapidly
increased and the lust for money seized the dominant
planting class as it had seized the millowners of New
England. Under the old plantation system, masters and
slaves dwelt side by side from generation to generation,
mitigating the bondage of slavery by a somewhat patriarchal
relation, but under the new system slaves were
worked in gangs with less regard for humane considerations,
and the profit-making motive swept everything before
it. Once condemned or merely condoned, slavery was
now defended as "a positive good," and inevitably drew to
its support the best intellectual strength of the South.

During these crowded years, the East, as well as the
West and South, was being transformed. The industries of
New England and the Middle States, founded in colonial
times and fostered by a protective tariff especially after the
war of 1812, began their spectacular career. Mechanics
from England came to America in large numbers, bringing
with them the designs of machines which had recently
wrought a revolution in English industry. In 1807, Fulton
inaugurated steam navigation on the Hudson; and far and
wide hamlets were expanded into manufacturing centers
through the magic of steam. The tide of immigration from
Europe steadily increased, and most immigrants found
their homes in the growing cities of the East. In the twenty
years from 1800 to 1820, the population of Boston almost
doubled, while that of New York rose from 60,000 to
123,700. Owing to the property qualifications placed on
the suffrage by the constitutions of the Eastern states, most
of the immigrants and native workers in the factories were
excluded in the beginning from the right to vote; but before
the first quarter of the nineteenth century had elapsed,
the restrictions on the suffrage had been broken down by
popular agitation.

### Jackson's Left-wing Movement

Here were the changed social conditions which made the
United States of 1825 as different from the United States
of Washington's day as the England of Cobden and Bright
was different from the England of Bolingbroke and Walpole.
The financial and industrial interests of New England
and the Middle States had now aligned against them
the laboring classes, the farmers of the West, and the slave
owners who raised cotton principally for the British market.

In 1828, there was found a standard-bearer who, curiously
enough, seemed to represent these three diverse elements.
That was Andrew Jackson, a resident of Tennessee,
a bold frontiersman, immensely popular on account of his
victory over the English at New Orleans and his unqualified
championship of what he called "the rights of the
people." Triumphantly elected, and feeling behind him the
irresistible pressure of popular support, he began an executive
policy which seemed for a time to transfer the seat of
government from the capitol to the White House. He
adopted the most novel notions about the rights of the
President under the Constitution; he ousted old officeholding
"aristocrats" without regard to appearances and circumstances,
and gave their places to his friends and supporters;
he destroyed the United States Bank, the stronghold of
powerful financial interests, in spite of the opposition
raised up against him in Congress; and when nullification
appeared in South Carolina, he issued a ringing proclamation
which showed that he was a stanch defender of nationalism
as against states' rights. During his two administrations,
the Republicans gradually dropped their old name
and proudly assumed the title of Democrats --- a word that
savored of anarchy a generation before and was then
abhorred by most respectable people.

In short, Jackson, a representative of the agrarian South
and West, ardently supported by the working classes in the
East, took his place firmly in the left wing of the party
started by Jefferson. His position with respect to the main
Federalist institutions and articles of political faith makes
this evident beyond argument.

The Federalists, besides funding the national debt,
looked upon it as an excellent permanent device for drawing
moneyed men to the support of the government. Jeffersonian
Republicans, on the other hand, had done their best
to get rid of the debt by paying it off, but the necessities of
the War of 1812 had piled it up again. In his first annual
message, Jackson favored the extinction of the entire debt
by payment, rejoiced that the moment for cxtinction was at
hand, and reached this goal before he went out of office.

Second on the Federalist list was the United States Bank.
On the expiration of its charter in 1811, the Republicans
destroyed it, but during the financial distress created by
the War of 1812 they had been forced to re-establish it.
For that reversal their radical followers never forgave
them, and early in his administration Jackson opened a
battle on this engine of "the money power." He practically
demolished it by a drastic use of executive authority and
finished the work by preventing a renewal of its charter in
Congress.

From the beginning, Federalist businessmen and statesmen
had insisted on a sound national currency, including
notes of the Bank circulating on a parity with gold and
silver. Republican philosophers on the right opposed the
issue of paper money on the ground that it added nothing
to the wealth of the country. As they thought, the bankers,
with government sanction, merely used the printing press
liberally to manufacture notes which were lent to the public
at six % interest or more --- a very profitable transaction
for the bankers. But Republican philosophers on
the left, while bitterly opposing the United States Bank
currency, favored a more generous issue of notes by state
banks, on the theory that they could pay their debts easier
and sell their produce at higher prices if a great deal of
money was afloat. Jackson likewise favored banks under
state supervision. Judges appointed by him interpreted the
Constitution in such a fashion as to permit states to charter
banks, hold the stock, and issue money --- a very ingenious
way of avoiding the constitutional provision to the effect
that states could not make anything but gold and silver
legal tender in the payment of debts. In their paper-money
practices, the Jacksonian Democrats went beyond the Constitution
back to the time of Daniel Shays.

With respect to the protective tariff, Jackson was true to
Republican theory when he said that "it is principally as
manufactures and commerce tend to increase the value of
agricultural productions ... that they deserve the fostering
care of government." But he vaguely added that they
deserved such fostering care because they catered to the
"wants and comforts of society." This uncertainty the
Democrats later cured by reducing the tariff drastically in
the direction of a revenue basis. None of them wanted to
abolish the tariff entirely, for that would have brought
about direct taxation on land, an alternative not pleasant
to farmers and planters.

Federalists boasted of having "the rich and well-born"
in their ranks. Jackson, in waging war on the Bank, made
himself the open champion of "the humbler members of
society --- the farmers, mechanics, and laborers" against
"the rich and powerful."

Faithful to the Jeffersonian tradition, Jackson looked
upon the federal judiciary with a critical eye. He refused
to accept as binding upon himself the decision of the Supreme
Court upholding the constitutionality of the United
States Bank. "Mere precedent," he said, "is a dangerous
source of authority, and should not be regarded as deciding
questions of constitutional power, except where the acquiescence
of the people and the states can be considered well
settled."

More than once he defied the Court by refusing to execute
its mandates and in one case he is reported to have
said: "John Marshall has made his decision:--now let him
enforce it."

### National Republican-Whig combination

Holding strongly to such opinions and commanding wide
popular support among farmers and mechanics, Jackson
seemed to be sovereign in Washington; but nevertheless the
factions opposed to his policies steadily gained in unity and
power. The banking and financial interests of the East had
every reason to fear that a calamity would follow the
destruction of the United States Bank and the flooding of
the country with paper money through the state banks;
many members of his party in the South, who sympathized
with the nullification policy of South Carolina, violently
attacked Jackson for his determined stand against the action
of that state. Furthermore, there was a well-organized
group of Eastern manufacturers who wanted to extend the
system of protective tariffs beyond the point to which Jackson
was willing to go. In addition to this host of enemies,
Jackson raised up against himself many disappointed officeseekers,
as well as the old officeholders whom he had
turned out. There was also in the West a growing number
of persons who wanted to secure larger federal grants for
internal improvements --- roads, harbors, canals, and river
facilities --- than he was willing to concede.

These elements of opposition to Jackson were finally
brought together in a new organization. Making use of a
clever vote-catching device, they called themselves National
Republicans, and nominated for the presidency in
1831 Jackson's powerful foe, Henry Clay, of Kentucky. In
its platform of that year, the party declared in favor of "an
adequate protection to American industry," "a uniform
system of internal improvements sustained and supported
by the general government," "the preservation of the authority
and jurisdiction" of the Supreme Court, and the
maintenance of the Senate as "preëminently a conservat ve
branch of the federal government." Defeated on this
straightforward Federalist program, the National Republicans
widened their base and about 1834 merged into a
more miscellaneous collection calling themselves "Whigs"
--- a title taken from English politics, signifying antagonism
to high executive prerogative. Marshaled under this banner,
they appealed to everybody who was discontented with
Jackson.

Nominally the Whig party lasted until the close of the
presidential campaign of 1856. It enjoyed two brief periods
of triumph. In 1840, without having made any declaration
of principles at all, it elected William Henry Harrison, a
military hero. After a second defeat four years later, with
Clay as the candidate, the party once more resorted to the
old device and in 1848 carried the day with another popular
hero, General Taylor. Even this design failed the
Whigs the next time, for their third military hero, General
Scott, was utterly routed.

Operating in a country predominantly agricultural, the
Whigs had to be circumspect in their conduct. Their choice
of military heroes as candidates lent confusion to the
period, but there was no doubt about the measures which
the Whig leaders cherished in their hearts. In their program,
the Federalist creed was repeated in full, or rather,
it would be more correct to say, continued unbroken. Indeed,
many a Federalist of the old school who had held
his nose during the years of Republican supremacy under
the Jeffersonians and during Democratic uproar under
Jackson lived to rejoice in the election of Harrison in 1840.
Nor should it be forgotten that Daniel Webster, the hope
and pride of the Whigs, "the merchants' pet," as he was
dubbed by Democrats, began his career as a Federalist. His
father was a Federalist and "it is said, being taken sick in
a Democratic town had himself removed lest he should
die in such pollution." The great Daniel himself, loyal to
his early discipline, fired his first political gun in 1804 by
writing a pamphlet showing the virtues of Federalism and
the vices of Democracy.

Upholding the Hamilton tradition, the Whigs placed the
protection of American industry high among the objects
to be attained by political action. Words they followed by
deeds. Although the tariff compromise of 1883, which
temporarily "scotched" secession in South Carolina, was a
sort of gentlemen's agreement to regulate rates downward
according to a sliding scale, the Whigs, with the aid of
Democrats from special sections, broke the understanding
and raised the rates in 1842. A cry of rage went up from
the planters, but the Whigs were determined and in a
hurry.

In attempting to restore the second Federalist institution
--- the United States Bank --- the Whigs were not so fortunate.
But their defeat on this issue was due to the death of
President Harrison a short time after his inauguration ---
not to any lack of will on their part. They were prepared
to re-establish the Bank and were simply outwitted by
Harrison's successor, John Tyler, a Virginia politician
nominated for the Vice-Presidency to catch Democratic
votes in the South. With their defeat on this issue, their
designs for a sound currency system also fell to the
ground. ...

That other interest dear to the Federalists --- commerce ---
was also steadily supported in every direction by the
Whigs. It was under Whig auspices that the movement for
subsidizing mail steamers on the high seas was inaugurated,
culminating in the Subsidy Act of March 3, 1845. It was
mainly with Whig support that this Act was maintained
and extended. It was under a Democratic President, James
Buchanan, that notice of "complete abrogation of contracts"
for such subsidies was served on American shipping
interests in 1859.

Less hampered by Democratic opposition in the field of
executive action, the Whigs, whenever in possession of the
Presidency, used the navy and the State Department to
advance the sale of manufactured goods in the Far East
and other places in the Pacific where agencies of power
could be plied with effect. It was under Whig direction that
formal relations were established with China in 1844, that
Japan was broken open by Commodore Perry ten years
later, and that the governments of the Old World were
warned against trespassing on American preserves in Hawaii
--- all foreshadowing the days of William McKinley.
In other words, the Whigs believed that the flag went before
and after trade and understood the nature of commercial
empires.

### The Fruits of Democratic Triumph

Between 1828 and 1860 the Democrats won every
presidential election except two, and during most of that
period they controlled Congress. Not long after the death
of Marshall, they got complete possession of the Supreme
Court. The numerical supremacy of farmers and planters
seemed to promise an indefinite lease of power. If conservative
planters had little liking for the leveling doctrines of
Jacksonian Democracy, they were practical men and finally
became convinced that they could only hope to hold their
own in politics against advancing industrialism by an
alliance with farmers.

On fundamentals of economic action the two wings of
agriculture were long able to agree. In fact, while the
Whigs were trying to get possession of the government by
nominating military heroes and avoiding a clear statement
of principles, the Democrats were making their doctrines
more and more precise.

In their platform of 1840, they wrote their agrarian
creed in language so plain that any farmer or mechanic
could understand it. They opposed protective tariffs, the
establishment of another United States Bank, internal improvements,
the creation of public debts, and all interference
with slavery --- the labor supply of the planters. At
every presidential election until 1860, the Democrats repeated
this profession of economic faith, and in every
presidential campaign their orators refined it.

In practice, the Democrats carried out most of their
promises. They defeated every attempt to restore the Bank
which Jackson had destroyed. They struck a smashing
blow at the protective tariff in their revenue law of 1846
and again in 1857, indicating their determination to destroy
the Hamiltonian system root and branch. In 1859, the last
of the subsidies for transatlantic steamships was ordered
discontinued by Congress, and shippers were given to understand
that they were to receive no such favors from the
federal government. In the meantime, as the Federalist
members of the Supreme Court, with Justice Marshall at
their head, passed away, Democrats were appointed to
take their places; and Hamilton's theories about the Constitution
were generally abandoned in favor of the rights
of states. In particular, the clause of the Constitution forbidding
states to issue paper money --- bills of credit --- was
reinterpreted in such a way as to permit states to set up
banks which flooded the country with paper currency; and
the clause respecting the obligation of contracts was practically
destroyed by new judicial reasoning.

Loyal to the anti-commercial sentiments of Jefferson,
the Democrats were indifferent to various proposals made
in the middle period for using the navy to occupy strategic
trading posts in the Pacific and the Far East; but they were
not partisans of a "little America." On the contrary, as
the party of planters and farmers, they were advocates of
that kind of expansion which yielded more land for slave
owners and freeholders. They brought Texas into the
Union in 1845, and waged a war on Mexico which ended
in magnificent additions of land in 1848, in spite of opposition
from the Whig side. If it had not been for resistance in
that quarter, the Democrats would have probably annexed
Cuba and huge slices of Latin America on the mainland
and in the Caribbean, thus strengthening the landed interest
founded on slave labor. To the influence of Whig opposition
must be added that of many free farmers enrolled
under the Democratic banner, who feared and sometimes
disliked the dominance of the slave-holding planters in
their partnership.
