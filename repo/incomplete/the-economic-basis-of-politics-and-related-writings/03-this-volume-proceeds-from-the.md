## This Volume Proceeds from the General to the Particular

Compiler's note: In organizing selections from Beard's
writings for this enterprise, the plan was adopted of proceeding
from the general to the particular --- from a broad
analysis of the whole business of discussing human affairs
to detailed studies of the economic factors affecting specific
political events.

The initial selection is Chapter I --- Beard's comprehensive
warning to readers against swallowing too avidly
any offerings now available in the vast realm of the social
studies. Here he points out certain specific weaknesses
common to all human discussions in this area. Being universal
in scope, this portion of the text by implication
serves notice on the public that it should approach not only
the works of Beard, but those of his critics and friends as
well, with some degree of circumspection if it is to see
matters in their "true light."

From a frank analysis of the problems common to discussions
of human affairs generally, the theme turns in the
second chapter to a consideration of the special difficulties
confronting those engaged in the writing of history. Here
Beard comments on the numerous obstacles _encountered_
by anyone who seeks to provide an accurate and full
account of the past, and on the advantages and disadvantages
of certain prime methods employed in tying
together historical events. In the process, he deals concretely
with efforts to analyze the long course of human
affairs in economic terms, dwelling in the large on their
usefulness as well as their shortcomings. Thus readers
receive a picture of the great "seamless web" of history, as
Beard visualized it, before struggling with those particular
threads of economics and politics which form the substance
of the remainder of this volume.
