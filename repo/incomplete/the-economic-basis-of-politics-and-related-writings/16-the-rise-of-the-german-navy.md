## The Rise of the German Navy[^/137]

In due course the representatives of the Great Powers
will assemble to consider armaments. Economy suggests a
reduction; fear of revolution to follow another war haunts
the boldest of the "natural-born fighters." At this grand
conclave will appear high-hatted diplomats looking wise,
bespangled naval officers wearing airs of omniscience and
assurance, hopeful pacifists dreaming dreams, advocates
of peace with their appropriate "formulas," agents of the
heavy industries safeguarding profits, and many journalists,
always worldly wise in small things and usually devoid of
historic sense. And around the edges will hover Bolshevik
observers convinced that capitalists cannot develop protective
intelligence and hence are doomed in advance, twist
and turn as they will. Success means defeat to the chief
participants and failure means disaster still more magnificent
in the next great day.

Unfortunately for the functioning of the conference, the
intellectual background has not been prepared. In spite of
the millions spent by peace societies for research and
propaganda, there does not exist in any language a realistic
description and analysis of all the forces now at work and
all the fundamental problems at stake in armament rivalries.
What is national interest? Who has the right to define
it? What is adequate defense? Adequate to what and to
whom? Why do armies and navies grow bigger and better?
What is to be gained by war? Who gains it, when, as, and
if? Do navalism and imperialism pay? Pay whom? The
questions are not even asked officially and the materials
for answering them are not yet assembled.

Happily, however, there is now available one excellent
treatise on a phase of the subject, which those who wish
understanding instead of illusion may consult. At the close
of the World War the secret archives of Germany were
extensively opened, and it is now possible for one nation on
earth to know what went on behind its governmental
façade during momentous years, to discover how navalism
operates --- its methods, hopes, and mentality. Taking full
advantage of this situation, Dr. Eckart Kehr has given us
a deep insight into the political, social, and ideological
presuppositions of German imperialism in his Schlachtflottenbau
und Parteipolitik 1894--1902 (Berlin, 1930) --- a
work which is thoroughly documented and has wrought
havoc among the apologists of von Tirpitz and company.
Dr. Kehr's book opens with an introduction on the evolution
of opinion respecting naval imperialism from 1867 to 1894. Then comes a minute survey of the rise and development
of the battle over big navalism, sketched in meticulous
detail, with data on profit-makers, prices of steel and
shipyard stocks, intrigues, newspapers, journalists, officials,
millionaires, propagandists and politicians, all set down
with frosty precision. This is followed by a calm analysis of
the "opinions" of parties, classes and orders of state on
imperialism and sea power. At the end is a section showing
that the naval-armament struggle is a phase of the
domestic social and economic conflict, mirrored in patriotic
ideology. Not often since Eve handed Adam the apple
have those who wish to distinguish truth from moonshine
had a better opportunity to eat of the fruit of the tree of
knowledge.

This close study of German naval policy furnishes hard
lessons for those Marxians who think that ideas automatically
arise from given economic conditions, inexorable in
spirit and form, and also to the theorists who imagine that
the world can be ruled by ideas without reference to
realities. In the German chronicle we do not at the outset
see capitalists and merchants drawing together on their
own motion, evolving an inevitable ideology and swinging
the government into line as their agency or tool. On the
contrary, the clarification and elaboration of the big-navy
policy for Germany was largely the work of Captain
Alfred von Tirpitz and a small group of men whom he
assembled around him.

That von Tirpitz knew precisely what he was doing, that
he had picked England as "the enemy" at the outset, that
he had a grand dream of German security, is nowhere
apparent in the record. Personally ambitious, restless and
eager for power, placed by fortune in the navy, he simply
made the most of his opportunity. Assuming a kind of
technical omniscience, he flatly decided that battleships
were better than cruisers, and that squadron formation and
line tactics were better than English empiricism. Having
come to these conclusions with the dogmatism that usually
characterizes the engineer, whose social knowledge is as a
rule sadly deficient, von Tirpitz then cast about for the
best way to sell his idea to the powers that ruled Germany,
not overlooking the man in the street. After a brief search
he hit upon the slogan that "the navy pays," that sea
armaments make economic returns to industry, and that
upon this hard foundation of economic cupidity must the
ideological structure of navy propaganda be built.[^/139]

Von Tirpitz' idea was not his own invention. Great
Britain had long before found out by experience that the
sea power was an efficient agency with which to build
empire, protect trade, exploit backward places and peoples
and smash rivals. The British, to be sure, had not theorized
much about it; they had been content to "rule the waves"
in fact, to write the law of the sea and to dictate terms in
all conflicts on the water. It had been left to an American,
Captain Alfred T. Mahan, to formulate systematically the
gospel of Weltund Machtpolitik in his writings on the sea
power in history --- works written not without an eye to
doing for the American navy what von Tirpitz wanted to
do for his, and not without powerful effects on politicians
devoted to the strenuous life, such as Theodore Roosevelt
and Henry Cabot Lodge, and equally powerful effects on
our captains of steel for whom Marcus A. Hanna was soon
to speak so effectively in the Senate of the United States.
As the noted naval critic, Sir John Laughton, said in commenting
on Mahan's The Influence of Sea Power upon the
French Revolution and Empire, "the book is throughout a
splendid apotheosis of English courage and English endurance,
of English skill and English power, the more splendid,
the more glorious as these are put forward not as a matter
of boasting or of laudation, but philosophically, scientifically,
as illustrating propositions in naval strategy or in
commercial war."


[^/139]: Consider "The United States Navy as an Industrial Asset,*
Office of Naval Intelligence (Washington, 1924).

Mahan's first "masterpiece" came out in 1890 and his
second in 1892. Of the latter Sir John Laughton remarked,
"important as it is to naval officers, \[it\] is still more so to
the statesman, the administrator, the shipowner, the merchant
and the tradesman." Both of these works went to
the head of the Kaiser and von Tirpitz like heavy wine. ...

Von Tirpitz had The Influence of Sea Power upon History
translated and made it a kind of marine bible for his
officers and propagandists, especially as it not only expounded
the gospel of might but also indicated the parties
who could be interested in the outcome, namely, statesmen,
shipowners, merchants and tradesmen --- from whom the
possessors of shipyards and the manufacturers of armor
plate were not sharply divorced. Old Germany, dozing on
the land and still infected by Kantian idealism, was to be
rudely awakened and set to "glorious" tasks, and the acquisitive
instincts of every group likely to profit from the
operation were now to be stirred by propaganda. At last,
in Mahan's works, von Tirpitz had the scientific, systematic,
economic and moral justification for the enterprise in hand.

Within less than ten years von Tirpitz had converted
enough hesitant and uncertain Germans to his program to
assure victory for his battle fleet. When his operations are
examined in detail, they are found to fall into the following
pattern: the preparation of "literature," the alignment of
interested classes, the enlistment of facile journalists and
publicists, the adjustment of party conflicts and the conquest
of the intellectuals.

The literature of propaganda took all appropriate forms.
A special division in the Navy Office assumed general
charge of it. ... To make sure that lay periodicals were
kept current, the Allgemeine Marineund Handelscorrespondenz
was established and regularly supplied the public
with specific "information" about the Navy, especially the
close relation between economic and the sea power.

All this, however, was merely a beginning. Money by the
billions could not be wrung from the nation unless its
governors, particularly businessmen and agrarians, could be
convinced. Although the fleet would "pay," according to
the new philosophy, taxes had to be raised to meet the cost
of construction. It was not difficult, of course, to enroll
powder manufacturers, coal owners, armor-plate makers
and shipbuilders. For them patriotism was clearly a paying
proposition. If any of them had any doubts on the
point, they were quickly reassured when they saw the
stocks of pertinent industries shoot upward in a bull market
as soon as the first great grant of money to the Navy had
been voted. And after the building had begun and plants
had been extended to meet additional requirements, gentlemen
of this order thought the navy should be still bigger.
Otherwise their enlarged establishments would be partly
idle and, as they pitifully urged, their workingmen would
be unemployed. Among them all, apparently, there was not
a single steel magnate to weep with Carnegie and Schwab
over the thought of death and destruction to come. Indeed,
taking advantage of the opportunity, the coal men of the
Ruhr organized a syndicate, raised prices on the Navy, and
in spite of its protests forced it to pay more per ton than
the rate on the world market. If some patriots were shocked
at what seemed to be greed on the part of coal owners,
they were not shocked enough to produce any effect on
"the technical evolution of the situation."

While it was easy to prove to munition makers and shipbuilders
the "necessity" for a big navy, that was not
enough. Other capitalists, who were to be "paid" indirectly,
if at all, could not see their earnings so easily. They had to
be taught. So, the navy propagandists began to round up
chambers of commerce by enlisting the great industrialists,
apparently on the theory that the small yes-men in the rear
would come when called. ... \[The\] majority were brought
into the fold, singly and in groups, until at last capitalism
was well mobilized behind the program and duly informed
as to the best methods for swinging recalcitrant members
of Parliament into line when navy budgets were voted. ...

The agrarian side of the conflict over sea power presented
many aspects. Out of the agricultural situation.
flowed no simple answer to this problem in statecraft. Yet
obviously agriculture was tied into the question of armaments.
Naturally the landed classes of Germany, led by
the Prussian gentry, wished to preserve their ascendancy
and to keep the Prussian monarchy and the Empire on
the old foundation of the land and the army, commanded
by officers of their social order. That much was clear.

Now if Germany went out upon the high seas, increased
her industries and enlarged the industrial population, many
things would happen to the economic system. The balance
of power would pass to industrial and finance capitalism,
and the landed aristocracy would be beaten by the bourgeoisie.
If German manufacturers were to sell their commodities
abroad on a large scale, they would import in
exchange huge quantities of agricultural produce, as a
necessity of trade and to feed the growing multitudes of
the cities; that meant fierce competition for the agrarians.
A great battle fleet also offered perplexities. While the
industrialists saw in it an instrument for keeping the seas
open in time of war, the agrarians looked on that as a
dubious blessing, because a blockade, instead of injuring
them, would bring an immense upswing in the prices of
their farm produce.

In the issue they also saw national defense imperiled
... the agrarians resented a diversion of money from the
army to the navy --- a diversion that ultimately weakened
the main lines of defense.

Hemmed in on all sides by a narrowing destiny, the
agrarians chose what seemed to be the only way out --- a
compromise with capitalism, not because they were converted
to Weltund Machtpolitik but because they had to
make adjustments to live at all. So in the end they voted
for the fleet demanded in the name of industry; in return,
the capitalists granted to agriculture the tariffs on grain
demanded for its protection; and the two groups united on
a program designed to prevent the conquest of the state by
social democracy. Perhaps never in history was a more
fateful decision made by directing statesmen.

The foreign-policy correlate of this compromise had
grave implications. On the one hand, it involved a surrender
of the industrialists to the anti-Russia sentiment of the
agrarians who had felt the competition of that agricultural
giant and had preferred to retain English friendship. On
the other hand, the agrarians were forced to give the industrialists
a free rein to compete with England in commerce
and sea power. Another result was to accelerate the
transfer of Russia to French capitalists for development
and exploitation. At the same time the coalition of the
bourgeois and the landed gentry put a check on the liberal
tendencies in domestic politics, which the former would
have otherwise favored within limits, hardened class lines
and placed an embargo on thinking. But when the combination
was duly effected, both parties were chained to it,
and government by reasoned policy --- enlightened, supple,
ingenious statecraft --- became impossible. No Greek tragedy
was ever more exact. Foreign and domestic policies
were caught in an iron framework.

In lining up other political factions behind his big-navy
program, von Tirpitz had difficulties. The socialists, of
course, were intransigent in their opposition, those "fatherlandless
fellows"; they were firmly convinced at the turn of
the century that his policy would lead to a competitive
struggle among imperialist nations which in turn would
end in a crash for all Western civilization --- a crash which,
as one of them said, would make the Thirty Years' War
look like a summer idyl. It happened that the socialists
were nearer the truth than any of the official prophets, but
in the eyes of the great and wise the former were merely
contemptible traitors, out of whose mouths could come
nothing good.

Between the industrial-agrarian coalition on the one side
and the proletariat on the other stood the Center Party,
Catholic in religion and astute in politics. Uniting under its
banner some big industrialists, a part of the proletariat
and many peasants, it cut across class lines. For a long
time it hesitated, while negotiations went on among its
leaders behind the scenes, but at last, in exchange for
power and the spoils of office, the Center went over to von
Tirpitz. ...

In the spread of "enlightenment," journalists and publicists
were easily enlisted. A large number of these birds
of passage, circling around in search of fleshpots and
lighting places, were easily collected about the Navy Office,
nominally independent but actually receiving their rewards
from that source. ... So, suddenly the German press
broke out with the rash in the late nineties, with the fever
of a bigger and better navy. ... Two newspapers were
engineered directly by the armament interests: Stumm's
Post and Krupps' Neueste Nachrichten, and they served
as feeders for outlying editors whose knowledge of the
sea power and its profits was likely to be deficient.

Finally, there were the teachers and the professors. The
former, as cogs in the bureaucratic machine, were quickly
subdued to the formula that every patriot must believe in a
big Navy. That was easy, for conscientious objectors could
be ousted and ruined. But professors claimed to be scientific
and impartial. How could they sail in the winds of
propaganda? The Navy Office found a way by suggesting
appropriate subjects for academic research and by supplying
statistics for computation and analysis-all calculated
to stir up interest in the sea power. ... In due time the
intellectuals were brought into line.

With the stage all set and the money voted, the navy
grew and grew. At last "the" enemy was needed. If one had
not been manufactured by the course of events, it would
have been necessary to designate one for the purpose of
keeping up the furor. Soldiers and sailors become restless
when their good weapons rust. So the enemy was discovered
on the horizon; it was no mirage; it was England.
In the end the gentlemen who worked so hard and so
long to build the fleet blew up with their own works, and
since that dénouement a number of German people have
begun to suspect the omniscience of naval "intelligence."
