## The Function of European Case Studies in this Volume

Compiler's note: There now occurs a significant change
of pace in the presentation of Beard's writings within
these covers. The effort to derive general principles regarding
the discussion of human affairs, the writing of
history, and the interplay of economics and politics during
great reaches of time and space yields at this point to the
simpler tasks of more ordinary research. The reader is
now invited to look at a few selected studies of varied
economic forces, operating over short periods, in small portions
of the globe.

For those who may feel that they have acquired some
broad background in Parts I and II with which to appraise
case studies of the type now about to appear, the change
in pace may afford opportunities to use Beard to analyze
Beard, perhaps a unique experience. On the other hand,
for those who remain unconvinced by Parts I and II that
what Beard once termed "the historical uproar" can in
fact be reduced to any general principles, the change in
pace offers a chance for a fresh start. If the troubles of the
general philosopher cannot be resolved, the question remains
as to whether it is at least possible for a skilled researcher
to cover the interplay of economics and politics
on a small scale in such a way as to provide valuable and
convincing unity, at least to some part of the human story.

The presentation of case studies begins with European
examples. Rather than attempt to isolate Beard's contributions
to composite works written in conjunction with
others in the field of European history, notably Robinson
and Breasted, reliance is had in Part III on passages bearing
only Beard's signature.

Chapter VIII treats of the interplay of economics and
politics in Great Britain during the transition from feudalism
to the modern factory system. It is a direct outgrowth
of Beard's personal visits to British manufacturing areas
and his studies in English history, around the turn of the
century in 1900.

Chapter IX, "The Rise of the German Navy," appeared
shortly before the Geneva Conference on disarmament
met, in 1932). It offered a glimpse into what was behind a
major arms development abroad, for the edification of
American readers then deeply concerned over the mounting
costs and hazards of naval construction in their own
country.
