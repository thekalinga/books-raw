## The Doctrine of Political Equality

The great political philosophers, with few exceptions,
have regarded property as the fundamental element in
political power, and have looked upon a constitution as a
balance of economic groups. The governments founded
and developed before the nineteenth century were in fact
complexes of group interests. Nowhere was the representative
system, in its origin, designed to reflect the
opinions of mere numerical aggregations of human beings
considered in the abstract apart from property and employment.
On the contrary, it reflected the sentiments and
views of different sorts and conditions of men, estates or
orders: clergy, nobility, burghers, and minor landowners.

In the United States where there was no clerical estate or
established nobility to be represented in the government, the
existence of the two fundamental property groups --- the
owners of realty and the owners of personalty --- was taken
into account either in positive constitutional law, or in the
check and balance system provided by the separation of
powers.[^/73] If the first American constitutions were more
democratic than those of Europe, the fact is not to be attributed
to radical changes in human nature, induced by a
voyage across the Atlantic, but, as the great Webster
pointed out, to a very wide distribution of property, due
mainly to cheap land.


[^/73]: Much ingenuity has been spent by American lawyers in
elaborating the theoretical fictions of Montesquieu. The real
significance of the separation of powers and its relation to the
balance of class interests in society was appreciated by eighteenth-century
writers, but if more modern statesmen have understood
them they have seldom been frank in setting forth
their views.

So things stood in the closing years of the old régime.
Then suddenly came two great revolutions, one in economic
fact, and the other in political theory. The first was brought
about by the invention of the steam engine and machinery,
creating an immense amount of property which had
hitherto existed only as a minor element in economic life,
namely, industrial and mercantile capital. So rapidly did
this new form of property accumulate that even in the
United States, by the middle of the nineteenth century, it
exceeded in value the agricultural land of the country.

Being more mobile and more easily concentrated than
land, a vast portion of it quickly fell into the hands of,
relatively speaking, a small portion of society. As land
was the great stabilizer of the old order, so capital became
the great disturber in the new order. Like a mighty giant
tossing to and fro in a fever, in its quest for profits, it
tore masses of men from the land, from their sleepy viltages
and hamlets, and hurled them here and there all over
the globe. Under its influence the old sharp class differences
were disarranged. The peasant might become a successful
cotton spinner, a financial magnate, a contributor
to party war-chests, a peer of the realm. The Manchester
individualists, Cobden and Bright, looking upon the new
order which they had helped to create, pronounced it good
and declared that because any hustling individual might
rise from poverty to wealth, the era of individual equality
had arrived. Instead of studying the new groups, the new
class divisions, more subtle and complex than ever before,
they proclaimed the glad day of equality. While James
Watt was experimenting in Glasgow with the steam engine,
and thus preparing to blow up the old economic order in
the realm of fact, a French philosopher, Jean Jacques
Rousseau, was experimenting with ideas scarcely less dangerous
to the ancien régime than the operations of the
Scotch mechanic. Unlike his distinguished predecessor in
political science, Montesquieu, Rousseau did not search
assiduously among the institutions and habits of mankind
to find a basis for his political philosophy.[^/75] Rousseau
was not a man of science or a detached scholar. He was a
passionate propagandist. He formulated the sentiments and
views for the third estate in France then beginning to
thunder against the monarchy, which was buttressed by
the special privileges of the clergy and the nobility. In his
Social Contract he set forth the moral and philosophic
justification for the revolt of the third estate.

In his system of political thought, Rousseau, in effect,
advanced several negative propositions. He denied that
there was any inherent and essential connection between
economics and politics. He repudiated the idea that the
nature and amount of men's material possessions and the
character of their occupations could have any substantial
influence on their political sentiments and their political
actions. He rejected the age-long view that the transmission,
alienation, accumulation, and distribution of wealth
bore a fundamental relation to the form and practices of
the government. He denied the doctrine that society is a
complex of more or less conscious groups and interests.
For the groupor class-man he substituted the abstract, the
cosmopolitan, the universal man.


[^/75]: Montesquieu recognized the place of economic groups in
his system of political economy:

>In a popular state the inhabitants are divided into certain
classes. It is in the manner of making this division that great
legislators have signalized themselves; and it is on this the
duration and prosperity of democracy have ever depended.
Servius Tullius followed the spirit of aristocracy in the distribution
of his classes. We find in Livy and in Dionysius Halicarnassus,
in what manner he lodged the right of suffrage in
the hands of the principal citizens. He had divided the people
of Rome into a hundred and ninety-three centuries, which
formed six classes; and ranking the rich, who were in smaller
numbers, in the first centuries; and those in middling circumstances,
who were more numerous, in the next, he flung the
indigent multitude into the last; and as each century had but
one vote, it was property rather than numbers that decided
the elections. Solon divided the people of Athens into four
classes. In this he was directed by the spirit of democracy, his
intention not being to fix those who were to choose, but such
as were eligible: therefore, leaving to every citizen the right of
election, he made the judges eligible from each of those four
classes; but the magistrates he ordered to be chosen only out
of the first three, consisting of persons of easy fortunes.

--- Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws, Vol. I, p. 10.

In order that we may get the essence of this new political
philosophy, let us make a somewhat close examination of
the doctrines laid down by Rousseau. He simply cannot be
ignored, for his Social Contract became the textbook of
the French Revolution and of that world-wide equalizing
movement which has in our day penetrated even the heart
of China, preparing the way for the overthrow of absolutism
and the triumph of the third estate. (See footnote 6.)

The origin of the state Rousseau finds not in a divine
command that one should rule over others, or in the fusion
of estates, but in a voluntary union of free men. Of course
Rousseau knows that this was not true in point of fact, and
respect for the truth compels him to admit it. But he cannot
allow the matter of historicity to interfere with the
foundations of his system of political ethics.

In Book I of his Social Contract, he says: "If, then, we
remove from the social contract all that is not of its
essence, it will be reduced to the following terms: Each
of us gives in common his person and all his force under
the supreme direction of the general will; and in return
we receive each member as an indivisible part of the
whole.

"Immediately, this act of association produces, instead
of the individual person of each contracting party, a moral
and collective body, composed of as many members as the
assembly has votes, which receives from the same act its
utility, --- its common being, its life and its will. This public
personage, thus formed by the union of all the others,
formerly took the name of city, and now takes that of
republic or body politic. This is called the state by its
members when it is passive; the sovereign when it is active;
and a power when comparing it to its equals. With regard
to the associates, they take collectively the name people,
and call themselves individually citizens, as participating
in the sovereign authority, and subjects, as submitted to
the laws of the state. But these terms are often confounded
and are taken one for the other. It is enough to
know how to distinguish them when they are employed
with all precision."

Having found the origin of society in a general agreement
of free and equal men, Rousseau naturally places
sovereign power by moral right in "the people" --- a collectivity
of all the individual members of the state. The law
of the state is therefore not the will of some class (like
the landed gentry) imposed upon all the others, or a compromise
rule produced by a balance of conflicting group
interests, but is, according to Rousseau, an expression of
"the general will." This alone is its justification.

Even if it destroys the rights and property of the individual,
still he must abide by it. "In order then that the
social contract may not be an idle formula, it includes
tacitly this engagement, which alone can give force to the
others, that whoever shall refuse to obey the general will,
shall be compelled to it by the whole body. This signifies
nothing if not that he will be forced to be free; for it is
this condition which, giving each citizen to the country,
guarantees him from all personal dependence --- a condition
which forms the device and working of the political machine,
and alone renders legitimate civil engagements
which without that would be absurd, tyrannical, and subject
to great abuse."

In the formulation of this general will, all individuals
share alike. Here Rousseau proclaims the doctrine of absolute
political equality with a vengeance. If the state, he
says, is composed of ten thousand citizens, then each
member of the state has one ten-thousandth part of the
sovereign authority. If the people is composed of one
hundred thousand men, then the citizen's suffrage is reduced
to a hundred-thousandth part, and he has obviously
ten times less influence in the formation of the laws. Hence
it follows, declares the philosopher, "that the larger the
state becomes, the less liberty there is."

But Rousseau is face to face with the fact that unanimity
among citizens is impossible and that the general will cannot
be the will of the whole ten thousand or the whole
hundred thousand, as the case may be, but must, perforce,
be the will of a certain fraction of the citizens. He boldly
meets the problem, and following the old philosophers he
holds that the exercise of sovereignty is by the majority.
The general will of which he makes so much, is in practice,
the will of a majority. With fine confidence he contends
that the will of the majority is right and works for
the good of the state. The minority is wrong; it is nothing,
because it follows from the nature of the social contract
that the minority must accept the decrees of the majority.
With the courage of his convictions, he says: "When, however,
the opinion contrary to mine prevails, it only shows
that I was mistaken, and that what I had supposed to be
the general will was not general. If my individual opinion
had prevailed, I should have done something other than I
had intended, and then I should not have been free."

As he contemplates the consequences of this bold doctrine
Rousseau shrinks a bit. There is a limit even to the
self-abnegation of the reformer. In Chapter VI of the
Fourth Book Rousseau safeguards the oppressed minority
in certain fundamental matters by requiring an extraordinary
majority of two-thirds --- even three-fourths in some
cases. But this is rather an afterthought, though a very
serious one. It does not vitally affect his extreme doctrines
of individualization. Neither did it check materially the
fateful consequences of his general doctrine of universal
male equality. Rousseau is aware of the dangers of mere
numerical majorities, but he cannot escape altogether the
results of his general leveling down. There is simply a limit
to which he can allow the logic of his argument to carry
him. Just as he excludes women from his "people" so he
sets some metes and bounds to the doings of the mere
majority.[^/78]

Nothing further need be said to show how revolutionary
was Rousseau's doctrine for the old order, or for any
order. Under it the rights and property of all groups and
all classes become subject to the will of the numerical
majority. Any system of government founded on a compromise,
or a balance of interest, in defiance of mere
numbers on the one side or the other, thus becomes not
only indefensible, but immoral and undemocratic. Written
to exalt the individual, it subjects him to a new tyranny ---
the will of a temporary majority. For his sufferings in
conscience or in property, it offers him the consoling information
that his individual will, being contrary to the
general will, is wrong, and, in fact, not his intention at all
or in keeping with his own freedom!


[^/78]: Aulard contends that Rousseau was a bourgeois and in
reality wished to exclude the propertyless as well as the women
from his "people." Whether this is true or not, Rousseau's
disciples, in the earlier stages of the Revolution, were not ready
to throw away all property qualifications on the suffrage.

Indeed, as we look at this system, it seems so unreal,
so ill-adapted to the world of industry and trade, commerce
and agriculture, that its implications are astounding.
We can hardly imagine how it could become the philosophy
of any people. An examination into the course of
events, however, makes the explanation clear.

Naturally enough Rousseau's philosophy did not appeal
to the French clergy and nobility, who were aware of their
class interests and of their numerical inferiority. To them
the social contract was poisonous and impious anarchy.

To the bourgeois, on the other hand, it presented a different
aspect. They had grown powerful in numbers and
wealth, and they felt keenly the oppressive privileges enjoyed
by the clergy and nobility. They were determined to
sweep away the discriminations against them, and to control
the government in their own interests. If they did
not contemplate the destruction of the clergy and the
nobility as classes, they did contemplate leveling them
down in their political and economic privileges. The
clergy and the nobility had a monopoly of the philosophy
of divine right --- the moral support of their power.
The bourgeois had to look elsewhere for a philosophy to
justify such leveling as they contemplated. They found it
in Rousseau's Social Contract. Searching for an ethical
support for their attack upon two powerful groups, they
exalted "the people" as against all special privileges. They
were playing with fire and they knew it, but there seemed
no other philosophy at hand to serve as a foil for their
enterprise. Unwittingly they started a conflict, the consequences
of which will last until the end of time.

In the shock of the French Revolution the bourgeois
overthrew the nobility and the clergy. They abolished the
feudal rights of the former and seized the property of the
latter. In their fear of the privileged orders they established
a legislature of one chamber and sought to safeguard their
property by a tax-paying qualification on the right to vote;
but the logic of their position was fatal. They had proclaimed
the rights of man as the moral justification for the
destruction of the rights of two classes, and they had at
the same time coolly repudiated the rights of man by
limiting the application of the doctrine to members of
their own class who had certain property qualifications.

Then followed the Revolution of violence and terror in
which radical leaders inflamed the disfranchised by appeals
to the gospel of Rousseau and to the proclamations of the
bourgeois. To save themselves the latter had to resort to
that other great source of authority, the sword. This instrument
was wielded by Napoleon Bonaparte, a man who
understood the relation of property to political power, and
who, through his constitutions based on checks and balances,
gave stability to bourgeois institutions. Even Napoleon,
the Bourbons, and the Orleanists, however, could
not stay the onward march of Rousseau and his legions.[^/80]

But it may be asked, how did this leveling doctrine of
universal political equality find a foothold in the United
States where there were no official clergy and nobility to
be overthrown by the third estate? Well, some writers
have labored hard to show that it is a French creation utterly
at variance with Anglo-Saxon tradition--whatever
that may mean. In the interest of truth, however, it should
be said that the free-and-equal doctrine is not French, but
English in origin. Its beginnings among English-speaking
peoples may be traced to the flood of speculation that
broke loose in England during the seventeenth century
when the merchants and gentry were engaged in a revolt
against the crown and aristocracy-the clergy having
been broken a century earlier by the bluff king, Henry
VIII, who confiscated much of their property. It was from
English defenders of revolution, like John Locke, rather
than from French authors, that Jefferson derived the gospel
of the Declaration of Independence. Moreover, the
economic circumstances in the United States were on the
whole favorable to the propaganda of that word. There
was no established clergy here. There was no titled aristocracy.
There was no such proletariat as formed the "mob"
of Paris. Land was the chief form of property and its
wide distribution among the whites (leaving the slaves out
of account) brought about in fact a considerable economic
equality to correspond to the theory of political
equality.


[^/80]: In the Declaration of the Rights of Man --- August 1789---
the French National Assembly proclaimed in theory the political
philosophy of Rousseau: "men are born and remain equal
in rights," and "law is the expression of the general will." In
the National Assembly it appears that only five deputies, however,
asked for universal manhood suffrage --- among them
Robespierre, who was destined to ride the storm of the proletarian
revolution which he fain would have tempered with a
pale and sickly piety. It is estimated that under the first French
constitution about three-fifths of the adult males were deprived
of the suffrage by the property qualifications established. Thus
did the bourgeois mutilate the doctrines of Jean Jacques.

Moreover, at the time that America was committed to
the theory of political equality, the people were engaged in
a revolt against the government imposed on them under
the authority of Great Britain. Like the third estate in
France they needed some effective and compelling justification
for their extraordinary conduct. Of course the
leaders of the American Revolution could have said
coldly: "We are fighting for the plantation owners of the
South, the merchants and landed gentry of the North, and
the free farmers in both sections, in order that they may
govern themselves."

Obviously, such a chilly declaration of fact would not
have thrilled the masses, especially the mechanics of the
towns who enjoyed no political rights under either system,
the old or the new. It was necessary to have something
that would ring throughout the country. Hence the grand
words of the Declaration of Independence: "All men are
created equal" and "governments derive their just powers
from the consent of the governed." There were critics
ready to point out that these high principles did not square
with slavery, indentured servitude, and political disfranchisement,
but they did not prevail. In the fervor of the
moment, Jefferson, while bent on justifying the revolt
against George III, in fact challenged the rule of property
which was guaranteed by the state constitutions drafted
by his fellow revolutionists in that very epoch. Even Jeffersonians,
when confronted, like Rousseau's followers, with
the logical consequences of their doctrine, shrank from
applying it. Nevertheless the grand words stood for all
time, and advocates of manhood suffrage and woman
suffrage afterward appealed to them with great effect in
attacking property and sex qualifications on the right to
vote.

When once the free-and-equal doctrine had been let
loose in the New World and the Old, it was impossible to
check its course. Steadily it made headway against governments
founded upon a class basis. Steadily it supplanted
the old philosophy of politics which gave to property and
to estates a place in the process of government. Within
seventy years after the Declaration of Independence the
battle for white manhood suffrage was virtually won in the
United States. Some remnants of the old system of class
privilege in politics remained, but they were regarded as
anachronisms. Time was to dispose of them. America was
committed to the great doctrine that in politics all heads
are equal and all are entitled to the same share of power in
the government.

In Europe also political equalitarianism has done deadly
work in the old order. In England it has not been carried
to the same degree as in the United States, but the Lords'
Veto Act, leveling down the power of the ancient and
honorable Chamber of Peers, is an echo of it, full of significance
for the future.[^/82] In Sweden, in 1866, the fourclass
system was swept away in favor of a general suffrage.
Austria abandoned group representation in 1907. The third
French republic abolished the Chamber of Peers and substituted
a Senate, now chosen by indirect election. At this
moment China is in the throes of a Revolution due to the
struggle between those who would establish a stable government
on the foundations of effective economic and military
interests, and those fired with a passion for "the rights
of man."[^/83]


[^/82]: The suffrage act of 1917, passed after this was written,
carried England into Rousseau's camp. The revolution that
followed the German defeat in 1918 swept Germany and the
new continental states into the main current. Russia, however,
went back to the class system while attempting to abolish the
clergy, the nobility, and the bourgeois as classes. \[Nearly all
the democratic governments set up in Europe after the First
World War were destroyed by dictators within a brief span of
years. _See below_, pp. 92--6. The Bolshevik class system of councils
representing workers, peasants, and soldiers underwent many
changes before a final constitution was adopted in 1936. Under
that constitution, the All-Union Congress represents population
and nationalities. Theoretically there are now no classes
in Russia. _See below_, p. 74.\]

The logical application of Rousseau's doctrine of complete
and abstract human equality is clear. It means that
the number of members in any legislature shall be apportioned
among geographical districts approximately according
to the number of inhabitants without reference to
their wealth, occupations, or interests. It means that all
high public officers shall be elected by majorities or pluralities.
Man is to be regarded as a "political" animal. No
account is to be taken of those sentiments and views
which, as Madison says, arise from the possession of different
degrees and kinds of property. All heads are equal
and, from the point of view of politics, alike. The statesman
is a mathematician concerned with counting heads.
The rule of numbers is enthroned. The homage once paid
to kings is to be paid to the statistics of election returns.
Surely, in all the history of thought, there is nothing more
wonderful than this "logic of democracy."
While this political revolution has been going on, have
the economic groups once recognized by statesmen and
political philosophers disappeared? The answer is emphatic.
It is to be found in the census returns, which, as
certainly as the doomsday book of William the Conqueror,
record the perdurance of group and class interests despite
the rhetoric of political equality. It is to be found in practical
politics day by day. Does anyone think that a thousand
farmers or laborers, going on about their tasks, have
the same influence in the formation of a protective-tariff
bill as a thousand manufacturers represented by spokesmen
in the lobbies and committee rooms of the Congress
of the United States? Does anyone suppose that the exemption
of trade unions from the provisions of the Sherman
Anti-Trust Law was the result of the platonic wishes
of "the people," rather than the determined and persistent
activity of the American Federation of Labor?
We are therefore confronted by an inherent antagonism
between our generally accepted political doctrines, and the
actual facts of political life. In the world of natural science
men do not tarry long with hypotheses that will not square
with observed phenomena. Shall we in the field of political
science cling to a delusion that we have to deal only with
an abstract man divorced from all economic interests and
group sentiments?
