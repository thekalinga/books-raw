## Federalist-Republican Alignment[^/1841]

IT IS CUSTOMARY to separate American political history
into three periods, using changes in party names as the
basis of the division. According to this scheme, there have
been three great party alignments since the formation of
the Constitution: Federalists against Republicans (17891816);
Whigs against Democrats (1830--1856); and Republicans
against Democrats (1856 to the present time).
Although the dates are merely approximate, they furnish
useful chronological clues.

But this division is arbitrary and only for convenience.
In fact, there has been no sharp break in the sources of
party strength, in policy, or in opinion. On the contrary,
these three alignments have been merely phases of one unbroken
conflict originating in the age of George Washington
and continuing without interruption to our own
time. ...

The first of these alignments --- Federalists against Republicans
--- was connected more or less directly with the
contest over the framing and adoption of the federal Constitution.[^/1842]


[^/1841]: From Chapter II of The American Party Battle, Macmillan (1928) with the exception of one passage from The American
Historical Review, duly noted below.


[^/1842]: The roots of party antagonism lie deep in colonial times. In
Virginia, there were contests between the upland farmers and
the gentlemen planters of the seaboard before the seventeenth
century closed. During the stirring prelude to the Revolution
against Great Britain, the division between the Patriots and
the Tories was supplemented by sharp divisions among the
former. More than once the mechanics of the towns frightened
the merchants by radical demands and serious rioting. All
through the War of Independence, the revolutionists were
split into radical and conservative factions-mechanics and
poor farmers against the merchants and possessors of large
property. See Beard, Rise of American Civilization, Vol. I,
pp. 266--8.

Authorities are generally agreed that the main support
for the Constitution came from merchants, manufacturers,
government bondholders, and other people of substantial
property interests "along the line of the seaboard towns
and populous regions." They are likewise agreed that the
opposition came mainly from the inland farmers, from
debtors, and from those in less prosperous sections of the
country.[^/185]

\[THE FUNDING AND ASSUMPTION OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY DEBT\]

The feelings aroused by the contest over the Constitution
had not disappeared when the first administration was
organized in 1789 with Washington as President and
friends of the new system installed in all branches of the
government --- executive, legislative, and judicial. With Alexander
Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury, in the
lead, the advocates of the new order, soon to be known
as Federalists, carried through a series of economic measures
which in time divided the country into two powerful
parties. In summary form, \[the first two of\] these measures
were as follows:

1. The funding of the national debt. All the old bonds,
   certificates, and other evidences of indebtedness issued
   by the Continental Congress during the Revolution were
   called in and new bonds for face value given to the
   holders.
2. The assumption of the revolutionary debts of the
   states. The federal government also called in the revolutionary debts of the states and issued new federal
   bonds instead; that is, the federal government assumed
   the obligations of the states and added them to the
   general debt of the nation.


[^/185]: Beard, An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of
the United States, pp. 292--9, and Economic Origins of Jeffersonian
Democracy, pp. 1--9.

These two operations, funding and assumption, deeply
affected the purses of classes and masses. Before Hamilton
began his work, the old bonds and notes issued
during the Revolution had been selling at from ten to
twenty cents on the dollar, because the national government
and several states had failed to meet their obligations.
During the dark days of uncertainty, a large part
of this paper had been bought by speculators from the
original holders at low prices with a view to profittaking.
In the end, funding and assumption increased
the value of the depreciated securities to the amount of
approximately forty million dollars --- a huge sum for
those days. To raise the money to pay the interest on
the debt, the federal government had to lay heavy taxes
on the people, most of whom were farmers, not bondholders.

\[Compiler's note: A short passage from an article
by Beard[^/186] has been inserted here for the valuable evidence
it offers as to the alignment of economic forces
during the vote in Congress on federal refunding and
assumption plans. The addition, beginning immediately
after this NOTE, runs to the next cross-head --- entitled
OTHER FEDERALIST MEASURES.\]

\[Under\] the funding system set up by the new government,
nearly all holders of old paper brought their securities
to the Treasury or to the loan offices of their respective
states to be transformed into new certificates of
indebtedness. If the Treasury records at Washington
were complete (unfortunately they are not) it would be
possible to discover the names of all those who funded
public securities under the law of August 4, 1790, except
perhaps those represented by attorneys.

The incompleteness of the records makes it impossible,
however, to discover positively what members of Congress
did not have securities; but the mass of materials
which remains enables us to find a large number who
did hold public paper at the time of the funding of the
debt ... unless we are to assume that the members
of Congress who appear on the ledgers were attorneys
for other parties. ...


[^/186]: "Some Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy," The
American Historical Review, Jan. 1914, pp. 282--98, quoted by
permission. Beard later broadened the study, offering the results
as Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy, Macmillan
(1915), still in print in 1956.

The proposition to assume the state debts was taken
up in the House of Representatives in February, 1790
... and on April 12 the assumption plan was defeated
in the House by a vote of thirty-one to twenty-nine. ...
The way in which the "innocent" Jefferson was ...
used to bring about \[the ultimate movement of the capital
to Washington, D.C., in\] exchange ... for the assumption
of state debts, on July 7, has often been told.
... Jefferson informs us that "two of the Potomac
members (White and Lee, but White with a revulsion
of stomach almost convulsive) agreed to change their
votes and Hamilton undertook to carry the other point."
Daniel Carroll, a large property holder in the region
where the new capital was to be located, also considerately
changed his vote.[^/187] Thus the bargain whereby the
capital was located on the Potomac and the debts of the
states were assumed by the federal government was
brought to a conclusion at a private dinner given by
Jefferson. The funding bill with the assumption amendment
was carried in the Senate on July 21. ... Three
days later the motion of Jackson, of Georgia \[in the
House\], to disagree with the Senate amendment, was
defeated by a vote of thirty-two to twenty-nine. ...

Of the fourteen senators who voted in favor of the
funding bill, with the assumption amendment, on July
21, 1790, at least ten ... appear on the Treasury records
as holders of public securities at the time of the
funding process. To this list Pierce Butler doubtless
should be added.

Of the twelve who voted against the funding bill on
July 21, 1790, at least five ... were holders of public
debt. ...


[^/187]: Compiler's note: Eventually, Beard reports in the same
article, Carroll "had the satisfaction of helping to engineer the
laying out of the City of Washington in such a manner as to
give an immense appreciation to the value of his farm lands in
the vicinity."

A study of the Treasury records shows that the senators
who held securities and voted for the funding bill
were, with one or two exceptions, among the large
holders of public papers, and that the senators of the
same class who voted against the bill (with the possible
exception of Johnston of North Carolina) were among
the minor holders. ... Seven of the twelve votes in
opposition came from Southern states. Virginia, North
Carolina, and Georgia were solid against it. These were
the states (particularly Georgia and North Carolina) in
which the debt had been so largely bought up by speculators.
...

The temptation to draw too many conclusions. ...
should be resisted. The one conclusion which is indisputable,
however, is that almost one-half of the members
of the first Congress were security holders. ... This
certainly justifies Jefferson's assertion that had those
actually interested in the outcome of the funding process
withdrawn from voting on Hamilton's proposals not a
single one of them would have been carried. ...

Finally,. ... an examination of the vote with reference
to geographical distribution of the public securities
would seem to show beyond question that nearly all of
the members, security holders and non-security holders
alike, represented the dominant economic interests of
their respective constituencies rather than their personal
interests. In many instances there was, it is evident, a
singular coincidence between public service, as the members
conceived it, and private advantage; but the charge
of mere corruption must fall to the ground. It was a
clear case of a collision of economic interests: fluid
capital versus agrarianism. The representation of one
interest was as legitimate as the other, and there is no
more ground for denouncing the members of Congress
who held securities and voted to sustain the public
credit than there is for denouncing the slave-owners
who voted against the Quaker memorials against slavery
on March 23, 1790.[^/188]


[^/188]: Compiler's note: Here ends the passage from The American
Historical Review.

\[OTHER FEDERALIST MEASURES\]

3. Protective Tariff. The third measure on the Federalist program was the protection of American industries
   by the imposition of customs duties on imports coming
   into competition with American products. Hamilton
   openly favored an elaborate system of protection. Although his plans were not adopted in full, the first
   revenue bill passed in 1789 was mildly protective and,
   in time, other protective features were added.
4. The United States Bank. Under Hamilton's leadership, Congress chartered a banking corporation, authorized it to raise a large capital composed, three-fourths,
   of new federal bonds, and empowered it to issue currency and do a general banking business.
5. A sound national currency. Under the new Constitution, the states had to stop issuing paper money.
   The gold and silver coin of the United States now provided by law became the money of the country, with
   the notes of the United States Bank circulating on a
   parity.
6. Discrimination in favor of American shipping. To
   encourage the construction of an American merchant
   marine, Congress provided that the tonnage duties on
   foreign-built and foreign-owned ships should be five
   times as high as the duties on American ships. In line
   with this, other concessions were made to native shipping, especially that engaged in the China trade.
7. National defense. In creating a navy and a standing army, Congress had more in mind than the mere
   defense of the country against foreign foes. The navy
   was useful in protecting commerce on the high seas and
   the army in suppressing uprisings such as had occurred
   in Massachusetts in 1786. In other words, economic
   factors as well as patriotism were involved in the process.
8. Foreign affairs. When the wars of the French Revolution broke out in Europe, the Washington administration, largely inspired by Hamilton, frankly sympathized with England as against France and looked on
   the contest in the Old World as a conflict between property and order on the one side and democracy and
   anarchy on the other-akin in fact to the political dispute at home.

### The Rise of Opposition

Now these measures were not excursions in theory. They
were acts of power involving the pocketbooks of groups,
affecting the distribution of wealth and the weight of
classes in politics. Certainly the first six of them bore
directly upon the economic interests of the citizens.

Under these laws, large sums of money were paid to the
holders of government bonds who had been receiving little
or nothing; people who were moderately well off one day
found themselves rich the next. Under these laws, stockholders
in the United States Bank earned handsome profits
on their investment, protected manufacturers entered upon
a period of prosperity, and merchants and moneylenders
were enabled, by the sound currency system and adequate
judicial assistance, to carry on their operations safely in all
parts of the country. Under these laws, heavy taxes were
collected to pay the interest on the bonds and to maintain
the new government.

Were these things done for beneficiaries at the expense
of other classes, notably the farmers, or did the increased
production caused by the operations more than cover the
cost? On this point economists disagree and the historian
cannot answer the question mathematically.

At all events, however, a considerable portion of the
American people came to the conclusion that the Federalist
measures and policies above enumerated in fact transferred
money to investors, merchants, manufacturers, and
the capitalistic interests in general, at the expense of the
masses --- a majority of whom were farmers and planters.
"This plan of a National Bank is calculated to benefit a
small part of the United States, the mercantile interest
only; the farmers, the yeomanry, will derive no advantage
from it," complained a member of Congress from Georgia.
The protective tariff on steel will operate "as an oppressive,
though indirect, tax upon agriculture," lamented a Congressman
from Virginia. "The funding system was intended
to effect what the Bank was contrived to accelerate: 1.
Accumulation of great wealth in a few hands. 2. A political
moneyed engine," protested another Virginia statesman.

In time, the citizens who took this view of the Hamiltonian
program were marshaled, first as Anti-Federalists
and later as Republicans, under the leadership of Thomas
Jefferson, who was by occupation and opinion well fitted
for his mission. A planter, Jefferson was acquainted with
the interests of agriculture. Moreover, he believed and
said openly that "cultivators of the earth are the most
valuable citizens. They are the most vigorous, the most
independent, the most virtuous, and they are tied to their
country and wedded to its liberty and interests by the most
lasting bonds." In logical relation, he had a low opinion of
commerce and industry, which created urban masses. "The
mobs of great cities," he asserted, "add just so much to
the support of pure government as sores do to the strength
of the human body."

Holding such opinions, Jefferson set out to enlist a large
following in his struggle against the capitalistic measures of
Hamilton. He made his strongest appeal directly to the
agriculturalists of the country. And when his party was
fully organized he took pride in saying that "the whole
landed interest is republican," that is, lined up on his side
of the contest.

Speaking of the Federalists arrayed against him on the
other side, Jefferson said that they included all the federal
officeholders, "all who want to be officers, all timid men
who prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of
liberty, British merchants and Americans trading on British
capitals, speculators and holders in the banks and public
funds, a contrivance invented for the purposes of corruption."

Appealing to the farmers and the masses in general
against the larger capitalistic interests, Jefferson's party inevitably
took a popular, that is, a democratic turn. This
was in keeping with his theories, for he thought that kings,
clergy, nobles, and other ruling classes of Europe had filled
their countries with poverty and misery and kept the world
in turmoil with useless wars. The common people, he reasoned,
if given liberty and let alone, would be happier
under their own government than under any ruling class.

To their economic arguments, the Jeffersonians added a
constitutional theory. They declared that the Constitution
did not give Congress the power to charter a bank, provide
protection for manufacturers, and pass certain other measures
sponsored by the Federalists. This was a "strict construction"
of the Constitution; that is, the powers of Congress
were to be interpreted narrowly and the rights of the
states liberally. Although the Federalists included in their
ranks most of the leading men who had made the Constitution,
they were thus accused of violating the very fundamental
law which they had conceived and adopted. In this
way arose the wordy battle over the "true meaning" of the
Constitution and the "rights of states," which occupies such
a large place in the history of American political loquacity.

To the disputes over domestic questions were added differences
of opinion about foreign policies. In the very
spring in which Washington was inaugurated with such
acclaim, the Estates General met at Versailles and opened
the first scene in the great drama of the French Revolution;
in 1791 a new constitution was put into effect and
the power of the king was practically destroyed; the next
year the first French republic was established; in 1793
Louis XVI was executed, and war was declared on England.
These events were watched with deep interest by
American citizens.

The more radical elements of the population, fresh from
their own triumph over George III, remembered with satisfaction
the execution of Charles I by their ancestors, and
took advantage of the occasion to rejoice in the death of
another ruler --- the French monarch. A climax came in
1793, when France called on the United States to fulfill
the terms of the treaty of 1778, in return for the assistance
which had been given to the Americans in their struggle
with England. The radicals wanted to aid France, either
openly or secretly, in her war on England, but Washington
and his conservative supporters refused to be drawn
into the European controversy. So the Americans were
divided into contending groups over foreign policy, and the
division ran in the main along the line already cut by the
Federalist-Republican contest over domestic questions.

### The FEDERALIST-REPUBLICAN BATTLE

As the critics of the administration, known at first as
Anti-Federalists, slowly changed from a mere opposition
group into a regular party and took on the name Republican,
the friends of the administration, with Hamilton, John
Jay, and John Adams in the lead, began to organize for
political warfare under the banner of Federalism. In the
third presidential election, the party alignment was complete.
Jefferson, the leader of the Republicans, was roundly
denounced as an atheist and leveler; while Adams, the
Federalist candidate, was condemned by his opponents as
"the monarchist." So sharply drawn was the contest that
Adams was chosen by the narrow margin of three electoral
votes.

During Adams's administration, the Federalist party was
thoroughly discredited. The Republican newspapers heaped
indiscriminate abuse upon the head of the President and
the Federalists generally. As a result Congress pushed
through the Alien and Sedition Acts --- the first authorizing
the President to expel certain aliens deemed dangerous to
the safety and peace of the country, and the second making
the publication of attacks on any branch of the federal
government a crime.

Under the Sedition Act, many Republicans were severely
punished for trivial criticisms of the administration. For
example, Callender, a friend of Jefferson, was convicted
for saying, among other things: "Mr. Adams has only completed
the scene of ignominy which Mr. Washington began."
In letter and spirit the Act seemed contrary to the
amendment to the federal Constitution guaranteeing freedom
of press and speech against federal interference. At
all events, the two laws called forth the famous Kentucky
and Virginia Resolutions, and convinced even those moderately
inclined toward democracy that Federalism meant
the establishment of political tyranny. The death knell of
the Federalist party was rung. Jefferson was elected in
1800 by a substantial majority over the Federalist candidate.

It has been the fashion to ascribe to the Federalists a
political philosophy born of innate ill-will for the people.
"Your people, sir," Hamilton is supposed to have said, "is
a great beast" --- as if in a burst of petulance.

Now this imputation is not entirely just. No doubt some
of the emotions to which Federalists gave free vent were
the feelings common to persons of large property --- feelings
of superiority and virtue. But there were practical grounds
for distrusting "the people." Throughout the Revolution
"the lower orders" had given trouble to the right wing of
patriotism, threatening to upset the new ship of state before
it was launched. Indeed, some blood had been shed in
conflicts among the Patriots themselves before independence
was won.

To the Tories who remained in America and rallied to
the Federalist cause, the masses were, of course, contemptible
in opinion and conduct. In the eyes of the Patriots of
the right, the new democracy was responsible for the
failure to pay the interest on the national and state debts
between 1783 and 1789, for the refusal to grant aid and
protection to American industry, for the uprising against
the "rich and well-born" in Massachusetts in 1786, and
for sundry other disturbances in the body politic. When,
therefore, Federalists cursed the people --- as they did in
gross and in detail --- they were not merely expressing a
conservative temper. Rather were they reasoning, so they
thought, from experience, bitter, realistic experience at
that.
