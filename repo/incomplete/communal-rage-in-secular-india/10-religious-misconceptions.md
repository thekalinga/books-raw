# Religious Misconceptions

Apart from the historical distortions that communal
Hindus indulge in to further their campaign of hate
against Indian Muslims, they also resort to a number of religious
misrepresentations with a view to convince the generality of
Hindus that the Quran and the Traditions of Prophet
Muhammad are antagonist to Hinduism. Many Hindu
intellectuals have supported this view by quoting from some
Muslim chroniclers and court recorders of the Muslim rule as
well as the western detractors of Islam. The former had their
own reason to concoct the versions; they wanted to glorify
the imperial achievements of their rulers and tried to justify
them on the basis of some religious edict or tradition; Ibn
Khaldun, the doyen of Muslim historians, has described such
records as "tissues of lies". As for the foreign critics, their interest
had been to paint Christianity in bright and Islam in dark
colours. They projected Islam as a religion of violence and
Christianity as the religion of love and compassion. These had
a detrimental effect on relations between Hindus and Muslims.

Through books and pamphlets and the activities of their
missionaries, who had landed in India simultaneously with
the British rulers, western propagandists and commentators,
impressed upon the Hindus that their reconciliation with the
Muslims was not possible because Islam gave only two choices
to non-Muslims: the Quran or the sword. They reminded the
Hindus of their past subjugation under Muslim rulers despite
the fact that their own scholar of great repute, Sir Thomas
Arnold, after painstaking research, had convincingly proved
by facts and figures in his monumental work, The Preaching of Islam,
that Islam did not spread, to quote his words,

>by the exploits of
that mythical personage, the Muslim warrior with the sword
in one hand and the Quran in the other, but by the force of
the teachings of the Quran and the character of the Prophet.

H.G. Wells, a bitter critic of the Prophet, in his Outline of
History, wrote:

>Islam prevailed because it was the best social
and political order that the times could offer ... it was the
broadest, freshest and cleanest political idea that had yet come
into actual activity in the world and it offered better terms
than any other to the mass of mankind.

In India, the northern
region which included the capital Delhi, where the Muslim
imperial influence was predominant, remained overwhelmingly
Hindu; conversions to Islam took place but these never
covered more than one-sixth of the population and those
who embraced Islam did so more for personal advancement or
social satisfaction than as a result of pressure from the rulers
or their commanders.

Again, there is no basis for the allegation that Muslims
fought and killed Hindus who did not convert; some Quranic
verses are quoted in support of it. These are deliberately torn
out of context; they were in reality directives given to Prophet
Muhammad while he was engaged in a life-and-death struggle
against the pagans of Mecca who were persecuting him and
his followers. They had mounted one offensive after another
against him even after he migrated to Medina. They conspired
with the Jews to murder him and take over the city-state which
had come under his charge; the Prophet guaranteed freedom
of worship to all by promulgating the "Constitution of Medina"
which provided equality of treatment to Muslims, Jews and
pagans. To foil his efforts at consolidation, the Jews and the
pagans secretly worked against him, despite the guarantee
given by him and conspired with the Quraish of Mecca to
wage wars against the Prophet and his followers. Allah
thereafter gave specific instructions to the Prophet, in the form
of the verses in the Quran which critics quote to denounce
Islam as the religion of violence. They do not reveal the real
purport of these revelations which were the directives by Allah
to the Prophet to meet the aggression of his enemies against
him and his disciples. They are not for general implementation;
they are specific to the particular event. There are also other
verses which pertain to other episodes in the Prophet's life;
all these verses have been explained by exegesits through an
elaborate thesis known as asbabul nazul or (reasons for
the revelations). I shall quote here the relevant verses which
are self explanatory.

In surah al-Baqara, verses 190 to 193 state:

>Fight in the cause of God
>
>Those who fight you,
>
>But do not transgress limits,
>
>For God loves not transgressors.

Then there is the warning given to the faithful to meet
the attacks by the pagans:

>And fight them on
>
>Until there is no more
>
>Tumult or oppression,
>
>And there prevail
>
>Justice and faith in God;
>
>But if they cease,
>
>Let there be no hostility
>
>Except to those
>
>Who practise oppression.

In the same surah, verse 216 says:

>Fighting is prescribed
>
>For you, though you dislike it.
>
>But it is possible
>
>That you dislike a thing
>
>Which is good for you,
>
>And that you love a thing
>
>Which is bad for you.
>
>For God knows,
>
>And you know not.

In verse 217 it is more explicitly put:

>Tumult and oppression
>
>Are worse than slaughter.
>
>Nor will your enemies cease
>
>Fighting you until
>
>They turn you back
>
>From your faith
>
>If they can.

Surah al-Tauba deals with the situation when the pagans
broke the treaties they had solemnly entered into with the
Muslims. So far the faithful were restrained from fighting them;
but, after their treachery, it became necessary to abrogate the
treaties and ask the believers to confront them. Even so, the
Quran told the faithful in verse 5 in the same surah:

>But when the forbidden months
>
>Are past, then fight and slay
>
>The pagans wherever you find them,
>
>And seize them, beleaguer them,
>
>And lie in wait for them
>
>In every stratagem of war.

However, they were cautioned:

>But if they repent,
>
>And establish regular charity,
>
>Then open the way for them:
>
>For God is Oft-forgiving,
>
>Most Merciful.

In surah al-Tauba, verse 123 stated:

>O you who believe in God!
>
>Fight the unbelievers
>
>Who gird you about,
>
>And be firm with them.

In surah al-Hajj, verse 39 made it still more clear:

>Against those with whom
>
>You are at war,
>
>Permission is given to fight them
>
>Because you are wronged.

In surah Muhammad, verse 4 directs:

>Therefore, when you meet
>
>The unbelievers at war,
>
>Smite at their neck;
>
>And subdue them.
>
>Thereafter show generosity
>
>By granting them ransom.

Each verse mentioned aggression, tumult, oppression as
the reason for fighting disbelievers who were waging wars
against Muslims but cautioned that hostility should cease as
soon as the threat receded. The verses were given for specific
occasions; but they have been twisted by fanatical Muslims
on the one hand and inimical non-Muslims on the other, who
use them to show that these are general directives to fight all
distortion by those who want to either malign Islam as a religion,
asking its followers to be constantly at war with non-Muslims
or use it to promote their selfish interests. To take them out of
context has been the regular pastime of the detractors.

A petition was filed in 1985 in the Calcutta High Court
to ban the Quran as it was alleged that the above-mentioned
verses preached disrespect to other religions and aggression
against non-believers; however, after giving full hearing to both
sides, Justice C.C. Basak dismissed the petition and said:

>In
my opinion it cannot be said that the Quran offers any insult
to any other religion. It does not reflect any deliberate or
malicious intention of outraging the religious feeling of nonMuslims.
Isolated passages picked out from here and there,
read out of context, cannot change the position.

These verses
however are no different from what Krishna told Arjuna on
the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Did he not instruct Arjuna to
kill even his own uncles and cousins? In the second discourse
of the Gita, in verse 31, Krishna says to Arjuna:

>Looking to thine own duty
>
>Thou should not tremble
>
>For there is nothing more welcome
>
>To a Kshatriya than righteous war.

Further in the same discourse, Krishna uttered a warning
to Arjuna in verse 34 that in case he failed to fight them:

>Men will recount this their perpetual dishonour
>
>And to one, highly esteemed
>
>Dishonour is worse than death.

Krishna assured Arjuna in verse 37:

>Slain, thou will obtain heaven;
>
>Victorious, thou will enjoy here;
>
>Therefore, stand up
>
>And resolve to fight.

In the eleventh discourse, in verses 31--34 the direction
was more specific:

>Drona and Bhishma and Jayadratha
>
>Karna and all the other warriors here
>
>Are to be slain by Me,
>
>Destroy them fearlessly.
>
>Fight: Thou shall crush thy rivals in the field.

The moral of the Gita is clear, namely that in the
advancement of the true faith and in order to repel oppression,
it is the duty of believers, as Dr. S. Radhakrishnan pointed out,
"to maintain order by force".[^/007001] These verses are thus no different
from what has been said in the Quran. As in the Gita, so in
the Quran, the emphasis is on the fight between men who
believe in the Lord and those who deny His existence.

[^/007001]:	Radhakrishnan, S., _The Bhagavadgita_, Bombay, 1948, p. 112.

Arising out of the same misconception, another canard is
spread, namely that Muslims divide the world into two separate
and distinct spheres: Darul-Harab, the world of war, where
Islam is subjugated and Darul Islam, where Islam is dominant.
The Quran makes no such distinction; it emphasizes, on the
contrary, the oneness of man and extols universal brotherhood.
Classical jurists, prompted by their rulers, were responsible for
coining these expressions to suit their masters' convenience
and their imperial objective. The Quran divides people into
believers of God and non-believers in Him; its basis is the
difference between truth and falsehood, virtue and vice; it
declared unequivocally that the best of believers is one who
performed amalus saleh, "good deeds". It is the same as the
distinction between dharma and adharma in Hinduism. The
fight between the two is eternal; it has to be waged in order
that the good prevails over the bad.

The Quran, no doubt, stresses the brotherhood of believers
and the Prophet repeatedly asked his followers to remain
united. This does not mean that this brotherhood was
exclusive or antagonistic to human brotherhood which is
equally preached by the Quran. That is why the Prophet has
been described in the holy book as a "Mercy to all God's
creatures". Islam holds every human life sacred; it abhors the
shedding of unjustified blood. This is explained by Allah in
the Quran in surah al-Maidah, verse 32:

>If anyone kills another
>
>Without a just cause
>
>Except in retaliation to murder
>
>Or for causing corruption in the land,
>
>It is as if he has killed the whole of mankind;
>
>And whosoever saves a life
>
>It is as if he has saved the whole of mankind.

The message of the unity of mankind is given in clear terms
in surah al-Hujurat, verse 13:

>People are created in pairs
>
>As males and females,
>
>And from their union
>
>Are formed nations and tribes;
>
>So that they may know One another properly.
>
>However, in the sight of God,
>
>The most honourable of them
>
>Are those who are
>
>The most righteous.
>
>God is, indeed, All-Knowing and Fully-Informed.

Again in surah al-Maidah, verse 48, the faithful are told:

>To each people We have prescribed
>
>A Law and a Way
>
>Which is open and free.
>
>If God had so willed,
>
>He would have made all a single people.
>
>But He desires to test each one
>
>In what He has given to them,
>
>So strive hard and compete
>
>In righteousness and good deeds.
>
>For the destination of all
>
>Is to reach God.
>
>He alone will show where each one differed.

The question of differences between people is clearly
brought out in surah al-Muminun, verse 53:

>People divide themselves
>
>Into different sects
>
>And cut themselves off
>
>From the bonds of unity,
>
>Rejoicing in their own sects.

Some commentators remark that verse 9 in surah al-Saff
establishes the supremacy of the religion, as revealed to
Muhammad, over all other religions. The verse reads:

>It is God who has sent
>
>His Apostle with guidance
>
>To preach the Religion of Truth
>
>That he may proclaim it
>
>Over all religion
>
>Even though the pagans
>
>May detest this.

This has been repeated in surah al-Tauba, verse 33 and
surah Fatah (61), verse 28. However according to Allama
Abdullah Yusuf Ali, one of the most reliable of the exegesist,
the word, 'religion' used in these verses is singular and not
plural. He writes:

>There is really only one true religion, the
Message of God, submission to the Will of God: this is called
Islam. It was the religion preached by Moses and Jesus; it was
the religion of Abraham, Noah, and all the prophets, by
whatever name it may be called. If people corrupt that pure
light, and call their religions by different names, we must bear
with them, and we may allow the names for convenience.
But Truth must prevail over all.[^/007002]

And the truth is one. The
Vedas proclaim the same:

[^/007002]:	Ali, Abdullah Yusuf, _The Holy Quran, Text, Translation and Commentary_, U.S.A., 1989, p. 1462.

>Ekam Sat Viprah Bahudha Vadanti
> 
>Sarva Panth Samabhaava

The Quran does not describe Muslims as the chosen people
of God. On the contrary it chastises Christians and Jews for
regarding themselves as such. Maulana Azad has pointed out
in his commentary on the Quran:

>The Jews used to assert
that so long as one was not a member of the Jewish fold, there
was no salvation for him. Likewise, the Christians used to assert
that so long as one did not enter the Christian fold, there was
no salvation for him. On the other hand, the Quran asserts
that salvation rests entirely on devotion to God and righteous
living and not on adherence to any particular group.[^/007003]

[^/007003]:	Azad, Abul Kalam, _The Tarjuman al-Quran_, Vol.2, Bombay, 1967, p. 40.

Further in surah al-Tauba, verse 39, a clear warning is
given to Muslims, as mentioned by the Maulana:

>If ever
Muslims as a community or nation fail to discharge their duty
laid on them, the law of God will have its inevitable course by
replacing them by another community which shall have the
talent to fulfil it. History will bear out how often the truth
advanced here by the Quran has demonstrated itself
in the life of nations.[^/007004]

The imposition of jaziya by some Muslim rulers on Hindus
has irked the Hindus considerably; it has been one of the
reasons for creating much misunderstanding between the two
communities. It is a fact that some Muslim rulers did impose
jaziya on Hindus; but, according to the canonical law of Islam,
it could not be justified in the manner it was done in India.
The Prophet levied jaziya on the pagans and the Jews when
he was engaged in wars during his stewardship of Medina; it
was a sort of poll tax to compensate for zakat or the alms tax
which was levied on Muslims. This was done to arrive at
equality in taxation between the believers and the nonbelievers.
Moreover, while Muslims were required to enlist in
the army and defend Islam against its enemies, non-Muslims
were rightly exempted from military service, as these wars or
skirmishes were purely religious in nature and the Prophet did
not think it right to ask non-Muslims to defend Islam which
they had not accepted. There is only one verse, verse 29, in
surah al-Tauba, which deals with jaziya:

>Fight those who believe not
>
>In God nor the Last Day,
>
>Nor hold that forbidden
>
>Which has been forbidden
>
>By God and His Apostle,
>
>Nor acknowledge the Religion
>
>Of Truth (even if they are)
>
>Of the People of the Book,
>
>Until they pay the jaziya
>
>With willing submission,
>
>And feel themselves subdued.

Allama Abdullah Yusuf Ali comments:

>Jaziya: the root
meaning is compensation. The derived meaning, which
became the technical meaning, was a poll-tax levied on those
who did not accept Islam, but were willing to live under the
protection of Islam, and were thus tacitly willing to submit to
its ideals being enforced in the Muslim state, saving only their
personal liberty of conscience as regards themselves. There
was no amount fixed for it, and in any case it was merely
symbolical --- an acknowledgement that those who were not
Muslims should bear a part of the financial burden which the
state had to undergo in the course of a war. Imam Shafi
(767--820), one of the four founders of Islamic Jurisprudence,
suggested one dinar per year, which would be the Arabian
gold dinar of a Muslim state, equivalent in value to about
half a sovereign, or about 6 to 7 rupees. The tax varied in
amount from time to time and there were exemptions for the
poor, for women and children (according to Abu Hanifa ---
699--767 --- the senior-most founder of Islamic Jurisprudence)
for slaves, and for monks and hermits. Being a tax on ablebodied
males of military age, it was in a sense a commutation
for military service.[^/007005]

[^/007005]:	Ali, Abdullah Yusuf, _The Holy Quran, Text, Translation and Commentary_, Lebanon, 1968, p. 447.

Allama Shibli Numani, the highly reputed Islamic scholar,
was of the view that jaziya was a temporary and not a permanent
tax; even the well-known orientalist Dr. D.S. Margoliouth
admitted that "theoretically the system of Muhammad provided
a quid pro quo for the poll-tax in relief from military service".
However, it is also true that several Muslim rulers misused it
and levied it on non-Muslims even when there was no basis
for such imposition other than harassing and humiliating them.
Prof. Bernard Lewis, the much-acclaimed orientalist, conceded
that the Quranic verse did not connote humiliation, but
remarked:

>What concerns us is not the original meaning
of the verse but the way in which it was interpreted in
historic Islam.[^/007006]

[^/007006]:	Zakaria, Rafiq, _The Struggle Within Islam_, London, 1988, pp. 3, 5.

Theologians in medieval times obliged the rulers by giving
it religious sanction to suit their patron's convenience; but no
interpretation, however ingenious, can alter the Quranic text
or distort its real intent. In India none of the wars waged by
these rulers were religious; also Hindus were freely recruited to
their armies and no exemption from military service was given
to them. They took active part in wars which even a ruler
like Aurangzeb fought; many of his generals were Hindus,
such as Jai Singh who commanded the Mughal forces against
Shivaji. These negate the very basis for the imposition
of jaziya. The emperor played with the Shariah, sometimes
to please the fundamentalists and sometimes to advance
his imperial purpose.

As for the concept of _jihad_, which has caused much
resentment among non-Muslims, it has been deliberately
misused by certain Muslim groups to fulfil their motivated
objectives. The word is derived from jehd, meaning struggle.
Hence it refers to struggle in the cause of God or in the pursuit
of truth. Force is, of course, not excluded; but the term is
generally classified into two: al-Jihadul Akbar, the greater
struggle, and al-Jihadul Asghar, the lesser struggle. The former
refers to conquest of one's self, to overcome temptation over
evil, which may range from anger, revenge, avarice, to stealing,
cheating, even illicit fornication; the latter refers to the
obligation to defend individually or collectively by means of
force, against those who are enemies of Islam. The wars that
were fought by the Ghoris, Khiljis, Tughlaqs, Lodhis and the
Mughals in India were all for the furtherance of their family
fortunes; none for Islam and none were so proclaimed by them.
And yet because the rulers were Muslims, their wars have been
described as _jihad_ by historians. Likewise the murderous
operations of the terrorists, who misuse it these days to further
their political objectives, are falsely highlighted by both their
supporters and detractors as _jihad_.

Allama Abdullah Yusuf Ali has pointed out that it is verse
20 in surah al-Tauba which provides the only appropriate
description of what Allah means by _jihad_. And it thus rules
out wars in India or the present terrorist activities in Jammu
and Kashmir and elsewhere in India as _jihad_. This has been
clearly explained by the Allama:

>Mere brutal fighting is
opposed to the whole spirit of _jihad_, while the sincere scholar's
pen or the preacher's voice or a wealthy man's contributions
may be the most valuable form of _jihad_.[^/007007]

[^/007007]:	Ali, Abdullah Yusuf, _The Holy Quran, Text, Translation and Commentary_, Lebanon, 1968, p. 444.

Maulana Azad has gone to the extent of saying that _jihad_
can be waged by Muslims against even their co-religionists
who do not truly follow the path of truth. He has stated that
in the eyes of God those

>who have sacrificed everything in
the path of truth and endure steadfastly the trials and
tribulations that befall them in the way of truth rank the
highest. That is the criterion of goodness. It is a lesson for the
present day Muslims who have developed an outlook on life
and follow a way of living so alien to the teachings of Islam.[^/007008]

[^/007008]:	Azad, Abdul Kalam, _The Tarjuman al-Quran_, Vol.2, Bombay, 1967, p. 12.

_Jihad_ implies therefore as much a righteous deed, which
helps a person to purify himself, as an armed defence against
those who obstruct the believers in pursuing the path of truth.
Maulana Maududi (1903--79), the founder of Jamat-i-Islami,
has clarified that

>the mere fact that you have entered Islam ...
does not entitle you to attack God's creatures nor does it give
you the liberty, by using the name of God and His messenger
to do all those evil acts which only the oppressors and rebels
against God commit.[^/007009]

[^/007009]:	Maududi, Syed Abul _a la_, _Fundamentals of Islam_, Delhi, 1985, p.250.

The Grand _Mufti_ of Saudi Arabia,
Shaikh Abd al-Aziz bin Abdullah bin Muhammad
Al al-Shaikh, stated in a fatwa that the hijackings and the
attacks were

>nothing but a manifestation of injustice,
oppression and tyranny, which Islamic Shari'a does not
sanction or accept, rather it is expressly forbidden and is
amongst the greatest of sins.[^/0070010]

[^/0070010]:	Ruthven, Malise, _A Fury for God --- The Islamist Attack on America_, London, 2002, p. 46--47

For the spread of these misconceptions, which has caused
so much harm to Muslims, I am afraid Muslims are no less
responsible. The process to malign Islam was, no doubt, started
by the West, with Christianity using all its weapons against it,
but the earlier Muslims successfully defeated their nefarious
onslaughts and marched ahead. As Bernard Lewis, a wellknown
critic of Islam, has put it:

>For many centuries, the
world of Islam was in the forefront of human achievement ---
the foremost military and economic power in the world, the
leader in the arts and sciences of civilization. Christian Europe,
a remote land beyond its northwestern frontier, was seen as
an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there
was nothing to learn or to fear. And then everything changed,
as the previously despised West won victory after victory first
on the battlefield and in the marketplace, then in almost every
aspect of public and even private life.[^/0070011]

[^/0070011]:	Lewis, Bernard, _What Went Wrong?_, New York, 2002, Flap cover.

But for the setback that occurred, the blame rests mainly
on the faithful, who could not rise to stem the tide against
Islam. On the contrary they did nothing to resist the new
challenges. The Muslim rulers, the elite, the religious leaders,
even the academic warriors, stuck to their outmoded traditions
and adhered to archaic systems and irrelevant traditions; they
would not give up their old forms of living and working --- all
these contributed to bring down the magnificent edifice of
Islam which had been a beacon light to humanity. The fall
has been so widespread that recovery has become most difficult.
To worsen the situation, _jihadis_ have now emerged, unleashing
a reign of terror, which has generated such revulsion against
Muslims that they are becoming the outcasts in society. The
torchbearers of civilization have been taken --- much to their
dismay --- by the rest of the world as the messengers of death
and destruction thanks to the misdeeds of the so-called freedom
fighters who pose as defenders of the faith.
