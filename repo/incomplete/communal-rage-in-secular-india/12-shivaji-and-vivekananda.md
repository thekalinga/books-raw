# Shivaji and Vivekananda

In their campaign of hate against Muslims, the Hindu
communalists concentrate on two towering and
magnificent figures who have done India proud --- Shivaji
_Maharaj_ and Swami Vivekananda. Their services to the
awakening of Hindus was unparalleled. Both gave a new vigour
to the projection of Hinduism and put it on the centre-stage,
revealing its inner strength and the spirit of broad humanism
that permeated its teachings. Both were liberal in their outlook
and advanced the cause of universal brotherhood. They
respected Muslims and appreciated the contributions of Islam
to the spread of love and compassion among Hindus and
Muslims; they admired especially the humanistic teachings of
the Sufis. It is wrong on the part of the Hindu communalists
to project these two heroes as the unquestioned and brave
fighters against Muslims and the redoubtable enemies of Islam;
their role throughout their career has been the quite contrary.
Let us first look at the career of Shivaji who is revered by the
Hindus as the great crusader against Islam to see if there is any
historical basis for it.

In medieval times, when religious dogmatism was the rage
all over the world, Shivaji exhibited an outlook against bigotry
which has few parallels in the annals of the world. He fought
no doubt against one of the greatest Muslim empires of those
days and was inspired by the teachings of his own religion but
surprisingly he never allowed himself to preach or practise
hatred against followers of other religions, including Islam. On
the contrary, the recent research that has been carried out about
his rule, reveal that he was motivated by broad secular values.
Stories and plays written about him unfortunately give a narrow,
distorted image of him. Politicians have also used his name to
promote parochialism and to divide the people on religious
and regional basis.

The latest edition of the highly reliable Cambridge History
of India, after an objective study of Shivaji's exploits, concludes:

>Let us pause to consider the sort of polity that Shivaji was
carving out in the Pune region. Many of the major writers on
the subject would have us believe that Shivaji was creating a
Hindu state, something fundamentally different and in
opposition to the Muslim states that surrounded it. The
Brahmin historians of the twentieth century, starting with
Rajwade, especially wanted to prove that Shivaji was guided
by Brahmin advisors from early in his life, and that he had a
vision of a state based on something called 'Maharashtra
Dharma'. Much of this, if not all, has been shown by later
research to be an artefact of the researchers, not a fact of the
period.[^/009001]

[^/009001]:	Gordon Stewart, _The New Cambridge History of India_, The Marathas 1600--1818, New Delhi, 1998, p. 65.

This was testified by the eminent historian, Sir
Jadunath _Sarkar_:

>Shivaji's religious policy was very liberal.
He respected the holy places of all creeds in his raids and made
endowments for Hindu temples and Muslim saints' tombs and
mosques alike. He not only granted pensions to Brahman
scholars versed in the Vedas, astronomers and anchorites, but
also built hermitages and provided subsistence at his own cost
for the holy men of Islam, notably Baba Yaqut of Keloshi.

_Sarkar_ also discounts any efforts made by Shivaji to find a
theocratic state:

>An attempt has been made in the present
generation to prove that the Maratha national hero's political
ideal of an independent Hindu monarchy was inspired by
Ramdas; but the evidence produced is neither adequate nor
free from suspicion. The holy man's influence on Shivaji was
spiritual, and not political.[^/009002]

[^/009002]:	_Sarkar_, Jadunath, _Shivaji and His Times_, Bombay, 1973, pp. 368--369.

The actual facts confirm that right from the beginning,
Shivaji adopted a humane policy towards not only the people
under his command but also the subject under his rule,
irrespective of their caste or creed. This became evident when
he started to recruit soldiers and select officers for the armed
forces. It has now been established that more than one-third
of his army consisted of Muslims and that the officers manning
his navy were Muslim Siddis. He entrusted the supreme
command of the navy to Siddi Sanbal, who was assisted, from
time to time by Noor Khan, Daulat Khan and Siddi Misri.
Among the judges appointed by him were Kazi Abdullah-bin,
Kazi Mohammed Hakim and Kazi Habib.

Shivaji's most trusted general in all his military campaigns
was Haider Ali Kohari. Even his chief security guard was a
Muslim, Hasan Kohari who was also in charge of the security
of his mother, Jijabai. Imamuddin Kohari supervised all his
military campaigns. When Shivaji was detained at Agra Fort
by the order of the Emperor he relied on two men for his
eventual escape. One of the two was a Muslim, Madari Mahtar.
Similarly during his historic encounter with Afzal Khan, Siddi
Ibrahim was his bodyguard. In his fight against Aurangzeb,
the man who commanded the Mughal forces was a Hindu ---
Raja Jai Singh.

Shivaji's respect for Islam was deep-rooted; this was evident
when he met a Muslim saint. During his visit to Khails in
Ratnagiri district, he paid a personal visit to the hospice of
Hazrat Yaqut Baba Sarvari and granted him a dastaweez of 600
acres of land. He told his followers: "Hazrat Baba Yaqut bahut
thorwale." He also paid reverence to Moin Baba whose hospice
was situated in Maloani. In the midst of his military campaign
in Balapur, he found some of his soldiers had looted the hospice
of Hazrat Inayat Shah; he reprimanded his men and personally
apologized to the saint and granted him a lifelong pension.
On another occasion, when a similar incident took place in
the hospice of Hazrat Jainul Shah, Shivaji assured the saint
that he would be given full protection thenceforth. Grant Duff
in his memoir of Shivaji has picturesquely described the
encounter between Shivaji and Hazrat Jainul Shah; it was not
only a meeting of two minds but also of two hearts.

The noted British historian, Dennis Kinkaid recorded:

>Even his enemies admire his extreme respect for Mussalman
priests, for mosques and for the Quran. The Muslim historian
Khafi Khan, who did not mention Shivaji in his chronicle
without adding an epithet of abuse, nevertheless,
acknowledges that Shivaji never entered a conquered town
without taking measures to safeguard the mosques from damage;
whenever the Quran came into his possession, he treated it
with the same respect as if it had been one of the sacred books
of his own faith; and that whenever his men captured Muslim
women they were brought to Shivaji who looked after them
as his own wards till he could return them to their relations.[^/009003]

[^/009003]:	Pande, B.N., _Chhatrapati Shivaji_, New Delhi, 1994, pp. 101--102.

Kinkaid said that it was worth remembering that such
enlightenment was in sharp contrast in the same century to
the treatment given to the followers of other faiths by the
rulers in Europe, especially in Italy and Germany and by
Cromwell in Ireland. The noted historian Habibur Rehman
Sherwani has also given a graphic account of Shivaji's various
meetings with the Muslim saints and the respect he showed to
them. The celebrated historian, G.S. Sardesai in his New
History of the Marathas has narrated that Shivaji built a mosque
for Muslims in front of his palace in his capital Raigad at the
same time he built a temple of Jagadishvar for his own daily
worship. Such concern for the people of another faith by a
ruler was unthinkable in those times.

During his military campaigns Shivaji issued strict
instructions to his men and officers that Muslim women and
children should not be subjected to any maltreatment and
that mosques and dargahs were to be given proper protection.
This has also been testified by Khafi Khan. He was equally
protective of the followers of Christianity and their places of
worship. Bernier in his well-known work: Travels in Mughal
Empire, has given fulsome praise to Shivaji for his concern for
Father Ambrose whose church in Gujarat was under attack.
Shivaji took care to see that no harm came to the priest or his
church. He told his soldiers: "Priests are good people. They
should not be troubled."

The greatest proof of Shivaji's broadmindedness is
contained in his long letter to Aurangzeb wherein he protested
against the imposition of jaziya on the Hindus; it is a
remarkable document which exudes statesmanship of a high
order. He reminded the emperor that jaziya had not been
imposed on the Hindus before by any of his predecessors. He
was full of praise of Akbar whom he often referred to as Jagad
Guru; his respect for the great emperor was unbounded. Shivaji
also appreciated the just and fair treatment given to the Hindus
by Jehangir and Shah Jahan. As compared to them Shivaji
wrote to Aurangzeb:

>But in your Majesty's reign, many of the
forts and provinces have gone out of your possession, and the
rest will soon do so too, because there will be no slackness on
my part in ruining and devastating them. Your peasants are
downtrodden; the yield of every village has declined --- in
place of one lakh (rupees) only one thousand, and in place of
a thousand only ten are collected and that too with difficulty.
When poverty and beggary have made their home in the
palaces of the Emperor and the Princes, the condition of the
grandees and officers can be easily imagined. It is a reign in
which the army is in ferment, the merchants complain, the
Muslims cry, the Hindus are grilled, most men lack bread at
night and in the day inflame their own cheeks by slapping
them (in anguish). How can the royal spirit permit you to add
the hardship of the jaziya to this grievous state of things?
The infamy will quickly spread from west to east and it
will be recorded in books of history that the Emperor of
Hindustan, coveting the beggar's bowl, takes jaziya from
Brahmans and Jain monks, yogis, sannyasis, bairagis, paupers,
mendicants, ruined wretches and the famine --- stricken that
he dashes down to the ground the name and honour of
the Taimur dynasty!

Continuing in the same vein, Shivaji reminded Aurangzeb:

>May it please your Majesty! If you believe in the true Divine
Book and Word of God ( the Koran), you will find God is
styled there as 'Rabb-ul-aalameen', the Lord of all men and
not 'Rabb-ul-musalmeen', the Lord of the Muslims only. Verily,
Islam and Hinduism are terms of contrast. They are (diverse
pigments) used by the true Divine Painter for blending the
colours and filling in the outlines (of His picture of the entire
human species). If it is a mosque, the call to prayer is chanted
in remembrance of Him. If it is a temple, the bells are rung in
yearning for Him alone. To show bigotry for any man's own
creed and practices is equivalent to altering the words of the
Holy Book. To draw new lines on a picture is equivalent to
finding fault with the painter ... In strict justice the jaziya is
not at all lawful. From the political point of view it can be
allowable only if a beautiful woman wearing gold ornaments
can pass from one province to another without fear or
molestation. (But) in these days even the cities are being
plundered, what shall I say of the open country? Apart from
its injustice, this imposition of the jaziya is an innovation in
India and inexpedient. If you imagine piety to consist in
oppressing the people and terrorising the Hindus, you ought
first to levy the jaziya on Rana Raj Singh, who is the head of
the Hindus. Then it will not be so very difficult to collect it
from me, as I am at your service. But to oppress ants and flies is
far from displaying valour and spirit. I wonder at the strange
fidelity of your officers that they neglect to tell you of the true
state of things, but cover a blazing fire with straw![^/009004]

[^/009004]:	_Sarkar_, Jadunath, _Shivaji and His Times_, Bombay, 1973, p. 323.

Lala Lajpat Rai in his biography of Shivaji has pointed
out that the real fight was between Shivaji and the Mughal
forces, commanded by the Rajput, Jai Singh. It could, therefore,
never assume a religious colour. There was no talk of a
confrontation between Islam and Hinduism nor did Shivaji
encourage it. S.M. Pagadi, an accepted authority on Shivaji
writes: "It would be wrong to depict the struggle of Shivaji
against the Mughals as a struggle between the Hindus and the
Muslims." Shivaji was, nevertheless, most devoted to
Hinduism. The distinguished scholar B.N. Pande has said:

>He was undoubtedly a believing Hindu, his attachment
to his faith being one of the deepest formative factors which
he inherited from his mother and his childhood associates.
The Brahmanic ethos, moreover, was one of the most important
forces for his legitimation, even for mobilization. His sovereign
status as a Chhatrapati was accepted certainly more by his
dazzling achievements but also by the recognition given to it
by the pundits, the epitome of orthodox Brahmins, the
recognized law-givers.

His personal religious affiliation,
however, never came into the way of, what Pande has said

>his broad humanitarian sympathies, even less to his essentially
pragmatic political insight. He fought against Ahmednagar,
against Bijapur, against the Mughals, against a host of Maratha
Sardars, at a time even against his brother, but he never
penalized a person for what he says, for his personal religious
sympathies or affiliations.[^/009005]

[^/009005]:	Pande, B.N., _Chhatrapati Shivaji_, New Delhi, 1994, p. 92.

V.B. Kulkarni in his Portrait of a Patriot writes of Shivaji's
deep devotion to his ancestral faith and the all-pervading
influence of his pious mother. Moreover he was determined to
protect the Hindus in their own land and secure for them the
freedom of worship and independence of existence. Thus he
exacted full requital. He grew up in an environment where
saints and savants preached love and compassion. Tukaram,
whose simple songs in praise of the universal God had captured
the hearts of every Maharashtrian, influenced Shivaji no less.
Tukaram advised Shivaji thus:

>There is only one truth in the world.
>
>There is only one soul in all beings.
>
>Pin thy faith to this soul.
>
>See thyself mirrored in Ramdas.
>
>Do this, O Prince
>
>And thou and the whole world
>
>Shall be thus blessed.
>
>And thy fame will pervade the whole universe.

Swami Vivekananda stands in an entirely different category;
he was basically a preacher of the rarest distinction who gave
a new dimension to Sanatan Dharma. He brought out in
their broadest manifestation, the secrets of human
emancipation and explored brilliantly the spiritual insights,
with which the Vedas and the Upanishads were embellished.
He was no sectarian; his love transcended all creeds. That is
why he had an appropriate understanding of the spiritual
obligations of Indian Muslims and was most sympathetic to
them. He never associated himself with the campaign of hate
against them; it is a pity that some Hindu communalists are
whipping this up in his name.

The protagonists of Hindutva are spreading the canard that
Swami Vivekananda is their inspiration and mentor for
promoting aggressive and militant Hinduism and for promoting
ethnic and economic cleansing of the Muslims. From my study
of the teachings and the activities of the great Swami I find
that what they contend about the Swami is totally incorrect.
He was, on the contrary, a convinced champion of good
relations between Hindus and Muslims. As for his involvement
in Hinduism, he was more an iconoclast than a revivalist; more
a unifier than a divider; more a universalist than a sectarian.

I have narrated in my book: Sardar Patel and Indian Muslims
an amusing encounter that took place in the Yervada jail in
1940 between Mahadev Desai, secretary to Gandhiji and the
great Patel. They were co-detinues. Desai found the Sardar
not well-versed in the tenets of Hinduism and hence asked
him one day to study the teachings of Vivekananda to better
acquaint himself with these; the Sardar asked him, rather
innocently, who was Vivekananda. Desai was taken aback
and gave him Romain Rolland's book on the life of the venerable
Swami. Though the Sardar and the Swami were intellectually
and temperamentally different, there was one factor, which knit
them together in an unbroken bond and that was their love for
India and their robust patriotism. It was, in fact, this aspect of
the Swami, which impressed Gandhiji so much that after going
through Vivekananda's works, he said: "The love that I had for
my country became a thousand fold."

Like Gandhiji, the Swami was a proponent of broad
humanism; both believed that it was the basis of Hinduism.
In November 1993, in the wake of the demolition of the Babri
Masjid and the communal riots and the bomb blasts, which
took place thereafter, the London School of Oriental Studies,
of which I had been a student, organized a workshop, in which
some of the leading intellectuals participated. It coincided with
the centenary celebrations of Vivekananda's celebrated address
to the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893.
The initiative for the workshop was taken by Prof. Nemai
Sadhan Bose of Calcutta, who urged upon Prof. William Radice
of the London University to collect the various scholars from
all over the world

>to give scholarly attention to Vivekananda's
social and religious ideals, to rescue them from the distortions
that were being worked on them by fundamentalists keen to
co-opt Vivekananda to their cause.[^/009006]

The workshop
unanimously came to the conclusion that "any attempt to
project the Swami as a Hindu revivalist, fundamentalist or
communalist grossly contradicts the evidence."

[^/009006]:	Radice, William (ed.), _Swami Vivekananda and the Modernization of Hinduism_, Delhi, 1998, p. vii.

Radice explained that the Swami's vision of the future of
India consisted of an amalgam of the best in the two major
communities. According to Prof Tapan Raychaudhuri of the
Oxford University, the Swami was

>among the earliest
nationalist thinkers to claim the Indo-Islamic past as part of
the Indian heritage.[^/009007]

Sister Nivedita, one of his earliest and
closest disciples, has recorded that her mentor took

>intense
pride in the artistic inheritance of the Mughal era and his
admiration for the Mughal policy of taking Hindu brides so
that the rulers of India had Muslim fathers and Hindu mothers.[^/009008]

In today's India, where power vests with the Hindus, he would
have been happy to note that in several cases the marital
coupling had reversed.

[^/009007]:	_Ibid_., p. 11.

[^/009008]:	_Ibid_.

Equality of human beings, irrespective of their castes or
creeds, was one of the most important features of
Vivekananda's ideal society; he had stressed this time and again.
But this equality that he preached did not imply "the equalization
of all human beings." He explained that human beings were
not and could not be equal; their shapes and forms were different;
their attributes were different; their natural capacities differed.
Hence, he said, sameness in physical forms or social status could
never be attained; to do away with such differences would bring
about death and annihilation. Even the ideals and outlooks of
people varied from age to age, group to group, individual to
individual; he advised, "Let everyone do the best he can for
realizing his own ideal ... Unity in variety is the plan of creation."

Vivekananda did not, however, condone the prevalence
and perpetuation of man --- contrived privileges for one sect
and discriminations against the other. As he put it,

>We preach
neither social equality nor inequality, but that every being has
the same rights and insist upon freedom of thought and action
in every way.

He went further and said that those who were
not ready to give freedom of thought and action to others did
not deserve to have these for themselves. His heart bled for
the poor and he refused to distinguish them on the basis of
their religious or casteist affiliation. He said the poor were the
backbone of the nation; if they ceased to work, the
governmental mechanism would come to a standstill and there
would be panic and anarchy all around.

Vivekananda struggled for the abolition of all preferences
--- of one nation against another, of one community against
another, of one sect against another, of one individual against
another. He wrote, "The idea that one man is born superior to
another has no meaning in the Vedanta." He applauded the
variety of religious traditions and pointed out that the Vedanta
had nothing against it. He said,

>... Whether you are a
Christian, or a Buddhist, or a Jew, or a Hindu, whatever
mythology you believe, whether you owe allegiance to the
prophet of Nazareth, or of Mecca, or of India, or of anywhere
else, whether you yourself are a prophet --- it has nothing to
say. It only preaches the principle which is the background of
every religion and of which all the prophets and saints and
seers are but illustrations and manifestations.[^/009009]

He told his
followers: "Never judge the customs of other people by your
own standards." Nor was he particularly enamoured of Hindu
customs or rituals. He did not accept, for instance, that bathing
in the Ganga would purify a Hindu of all his sins; in that case,
he said, fish would be the purest of all beings.

[^/009009]:	_Ibid_., p. 218.

The Swami showed equal respect to all religious scriptures; he
once asked his disciples, "Who has given you the right to say that
truth exists nowhere else but in the Vedas." A true Vendantist, he
told the Hindus did not talk of the superiority of one religion over
another. Even "toleration" of other faiths was not right; it smacked
of blasphemy. He said, "Why should I tolerate. Toleration means
that you are wrong and I am just allowing you."[^/0090010] His Guru Sri
Ramakrishna, he pointed out, had accepted all religions as true.

[^/0090010]:	_Ibid_., p. 285.

I shall narrate a few incidents from the Swami's life to
illustrate the liberality of his outlook, particularly in relation
to Indian Muslims. He often talked teelingly of a Muslim fakir
--- Zulfikar Ali, who had saved his life when as a wandering
monk in the early stage, the Swami collapsed at a place near
Almora. He had eaten no food for several days. The fakir found
him half dead and gave him a cucumber to eat, which revived
him. The Swami had several intellectual encounters with
Muslim theologians and confessed that these widened his
spiritual horizon. He was impressed by the fact that the Quran
had retained its pristine purity despite the lapse of more than a
thousand years. He went through it and praised it as "an
intellectual and spiritual possession." He unhesitatingly accepted
the invitation of a Maulvi to have a meal with him and told him
not to bother about making any special arrangement for him.
Likewise at Mount Abu he agreed to live in the home of a Muslim
lawyer, on the condition that he treated him as a member of his
family, partaking the same food as they did. The lawyer did not, of
course, cook any meat during the Swami's stay, though Vivekananda
did not disapprove of meat-eating. His staying with a Muslim was
frowned upon by the orthodox Hindus; but this had no effect on
him. He told them, "I am above all your social conventions ... I am
not afraid of you people and your society. You know nothing of
God and the scriptures."[^/0090011]

[^/0090011]:	_Ibid_., p. 288.

The Swami, while on his travels through the length and
breath of India, watched with interest the way the village folks
lived together especially the goodwill that prevailed between
Hindus and Muslims. There was mutual concern for each other.
In this he saw the real unity of India. He said that the piety of
the Hindus on the banks of the Ganga was no different than
the piety of the Muslims offering their namaaz in a mosque.
During his travels, he once met a Muslim woman in Kashmir,
who created a deep impact on his mind. He was accompanied
by sister Nivedita who has recounted it thus:

>Not least of
these pictures (of the beauty of Kashmir) is the memory of the
handsome old woman, wearing the crimson coronet and white
veil of Kashmiri peasants, who sat at her spinning wheel under
a great chennar tree in a farm surrounded by her daughters-inlaw,
when we passed that way, and stopped to visit her. It was
the Swami's second call on her. He had received some small
kindness at her hands the year before, and had never tired of
telling how after this, when he asked, before saying farewell,
'And mother, of what religion are you?' Her whole face had lit
up with pride and joy, and her old voice rung out in triumph.
as she answered loudly and clearly, 'I thank our God; by the
mercy of the Lord, I am a Mussalman."[^/0090012]

[^/0090012]:	_Ibid_.

The Swami was moved
by the intensity of faith of the poor woman!

Swami Vivekananda was a great exponent of freewill and
freedom of choice. A brother monk had given shelter to a
Muslim orphan; he asked Vivekananda how he should bring
him up. He replied, "Look after him as your own but do not
interfere with his religion". Because of his transparent love for
all, without a tinge of prejudice, the Swami was warmly
welcomed by the followers of all religions, including the
Muslims wherever he went. It is said that the Nizam of
Hyderabad had once offered to bear the expenses of his foreign
tours to propagate his mission, but Vivekananda politely
declined. The Swami was also responsible in easing the tension
between the Arya Samajists and the Muslims. He told them
that true religion was meant to unite and not to divide people.
In his letter to Sarfaraz Husain, Vivekananda wrote that love
was the motivating force behind all religions. He remarked
that

>without the help of practical Islam, theories of Vedantism,
however, fine and wonderful they may be, are entirely valueless
to the vast mass of mankind. For our own motherland a
junction of the two great systems, Hinduism and Islam ---
Vedanta brain and Islam body --- is the only hope.[^/0090013]

He told
the detractors of the Muslim rule: "The Muhammadan
conquest of India came as a salvation to the downtrodden, to
the poor. That is why one-fifth of our people have become
Muhammadans." He denied that "it was all the work of sword
and fire" and said that to call it so was "the height of madness."[^/0090014]
Strong words, which indicated his conviction. As Prof Bose
has observed,

>To him the Muslims were as good and humnan,
and at heart as Indian, as the Hindus. There was affinity
between Sufism and Advaita Vedanta. The distinction between
them by reason of their different beliefs were subordinate to
their identity as fellow countrymen.

The Swami was, no
doubt, critical of some features of Islam but so was he of
Hinduism. He was never dogmatic but a rationalist to the
core. He always looked at the better side of every faith. He
was a humanist to his fingertips believing in the eternal values
which unite all sections of the human race, emphasizing that
it will attain salvation only through love and compassion.
