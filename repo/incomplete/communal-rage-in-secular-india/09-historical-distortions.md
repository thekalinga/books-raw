# Historical Distortions

Much of the alienation between Hindus and Muslims
took place, as I mentioned earlier, after the advent
of the British. Their governors like Sir William Muir and
historians like Vincent Smith freely resorted to historical
distortions and religious misrepresentations about Muslims and
Islam in order to prejudice Hindus against them. This
particularly influenced the rising Hindu intellectual class. They
were made to believe that most Muslim rulers persecuted
Hindus, destroyed their temples and broke their idols. Fanciful
versions were given and the number of temples destroyed by
Muslim rulers was eventually put at 3000 and above; on their
debris, it was further alleged, mosques were built. There is
absolutely no basis to the charge; the figure is a concoction of
fertile brains which has been refuted by eminent historians
such as R.C. Majumdar, the general editor of the elevenvolume
History of India, published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan
which has been accepted by even the votaries of Hindutva as
most authentic.

Muslims first came to India as invaders in 711 when
Muhammad bin Qasim invaded Sind; it was a retaliatory action
on his part as Raja Dhir refused to pay compensation for the
piracy of his ship by the Raja's men. During the rule of these
Arabs which was confined to Sind, Hindus were neither
persecuted nor was a single temple destroyed.

Then after a lapse of three hundred years, came Mahmud
of Ghazni (971--1030); he plundered the treasures of Somnath
in 1020; this was a pure and simple loot that had nothing to do
with Islam. He took away all the gold, diamonds and other
precious jewels from the temple to Ghazni. On his way back he
conquered Multan but appointed a Hindu governor to
administer it. According to K.R. Malkani, Mahmud was

>a recent convert from Afghan Savism to Islam ... This master
brigand was quite a secularist as his Indian coins were
struck in Sanskrit and they bore the image of either Lakshmi
or Siva's Nandi.

This was followed by the expedition of Muhammad of Ghor
(1175--1206). He invaded Multan to protect his Ismaili people;
but Prithvijit's army gave him a good fight; he was assisted in
his expedition by a Muslim commander Husain Shah.
Muhammad's rule was also of short duration. He was
overthrown by his slave, Qutb-ud-din Aybak (1206--10) who
was said to be a competent ruler. He showed no preference for
the local Muslims and left the Hindus alone. His only interest
was to protect his throne.

He was succeeded by Iltutmish (1211--36), who was much
troubled by his Forty Amirs. They intrigued against him by
inciting the Muslim fundamentalists. They contended that
the king's preference for his daughter Razia as his successor as
against his son was a sin. Islam, they said, did not sanction the
rule of a woman. Despite their opposition, Iltutmish before he
died nominated his daughter to the throne; the Forty Amirs,
who were supported by the Ulama were furious; they intrigued
against Razia. She ruled for just three and half years and was
killed. Razia gave full protection to her Hindu subjects, did
not allow any discrimination against them and introduced many
liberal reforms. In my book: Razia: Queen of India, which has
been recently reprinted by Oxford University Press as a standard
text, there is enough evidence to show that Razia was a fair
and just ruler.

Ghiyasuddin Balban (1206--87) was one of the Forty Amirs
who succeeded Razia. He was a strong ruler and defied the
Ulama by declaring himself as the "vice-regent of God". This
was an affront to Islam. He projected himself in the traditions
of the ancient kings of Iran. According to the historian Barani,
"Balban had no fear of God. All that mattered to him was his
own interest regardless of whether it was in consonance with
the Shariah or not". He made no distinction between his Hindu
and Muslim subjects.

Then came Alauddin Khilji (1296--1316), who spent all
his time in consolidating his rule. The Muslim tribesmen who
revolted against him numbering around 30,000, were
mercilessly slaughtered by him. When the chief _Mufti_ protested,
the king declared:

>I don't care what your Shariah prescribes.
>I do whatever is in the best interest of my rule.[^/006001]

[^/006001]:	Majumdar, R.C., _et al._, _An Advanced History of India_, Madras, 1978, p. 298.

Muhammad Tughlaq (1325--51) was regarded by some as a
genius and by others as an eccentric. He planned to conquer
the world and came out with many hare-brained schemes,
which had little to do with the welfare of his subjects, both
Hindus and Muslims. His successor Firuz Tughlaq (1351--88)
was, however, a fanatic. He regarded himself as the defender
of Islam; he persecuted the Hindus, imposed jaziya on them
and destroyed their temples. Soon thereafter, Timur (1370--1405) arrived in Delhi like a hurricane and brought with
him, to quote the chronicler Badauni,

>such famine and
pestilence ... that the city was utterly ruined and all its
inhabitants, without any distinction between Hindus and
Muslims, were massacred by him. For two months not a bird
moved a wing.[^/006002]

Eventually his governor, Khirz Khan, in
charge of Multan defeated Timur's men and established his
own kingdom under the family name of Sayyids (1414--51).
These rulers were incompetent and according to the chronicler
Nizamuddin Ahmad,

>the affairs of the state grew worse day
by day and more and more anarchic and each noble took
charge of one place or another at twenty or more krohs from
Delhi.

As a result, the governor of Lahore Buhlul Khan Lodi
(1451--89) took over the kingdom. His successor Sikandar Lodi
(1489--1517) became a tool in the hands of the Ulama; he
prosecuted the Hindus who rose in revolt against him. His
son, Ibrahim Lodi (1517--26) succeeded him but could not
control the deteriorating situation. Two of his generals, Daulat
Khan and Alam Khan then invited Babur (1483--1530) to
come to Delhi with his army and take over the throne. Babur
came, fought the battle of Panipat, overthrew Ibrahim Lodi
and established the rule of the Mughals.

[^/006002]:	_Ibid_., p. 329.

The Sultans of this regime were mainly concerned with
consolidating their rule; they did not bother about following
the Shariah and except Firuz Tughlaq, none of them ill-treated
their Hindu subjects. Their main concern was the preservation
of their rule. And thus they concentrated on maintaining
internal peace and avoiding trouble in their kingdom. They
encouraged social contact between Hindus and Muslims which
gave rise to the Bhakti movement, the greatest exponents of
it being Kabir (1440--1518) and Nanak (1469--1539).

One outcome of the intermingling of the two communities
was the birth of a common language known as Khari-boli which
later developed into Urdu. There was also a literary and cultural
renaissance: poetry, music and the arts blossomed across
northern India. Governors of provinces became patrons of
intercommunal fusion. Zayn al-Abidin's (1420--70) rule in
Kashmir was the high watermark of Hindu--Muslim fraternity;
it also fostered under the Husayn Shahi dynasty (1493--1539)
in Bengal and the Bahmanis (1347--1526) in the Deccan. The
Adil Shahis of Bijapur (1490--1686), the Nizam Shahis of
Ahmednagar (1490--1600), the Imad Shahis of Berar (14851574),
the Barid Shahis of Bidar (1492--1619) and the Qutb
Shahis of Golconda (1512--1687) actively encouraged
communal harmony by bringing their Hindu and Muslim
subjects together on festive occasions.

According to the contemporary chronicler Farishta,

>the
Sultans ignored canonical law, as expounded by the Ulama
and based their system on political expediency and worldly
experience.

Their treatment of the Hindu subjects was, by
and large, humane; they gave full religious liberty to them.
They were allowed to worship their idols, blow conches, bathe
in the Ganga and the Jamuna and take out religious
processions without let or hindrance.

Except for the Khiljis and the Tughlaqs, these sultans were
petty rulers; they ruled over small parts of India from Delhi. It
is, therefore, incorrect to describe the Delhi Sultanate in the
same terms as the Mughal empire. Most of the sultans exercised
limited power, struggling to control their subedars who ofter
rebelled against their authority and established tiny
independent kingdoms of their own. Most of India was, in
fact, under the control of Hindu rulers or rajas of one region or
the other. They were independent and under no Muslim ruler.
There was a common saying:

>How Sultan after Sultan with his pomp
> 
>Abode his destined hour, and went his way.[^/006003]

[^/006003]:	Watson, Francis, _A Concise History of India_, 1974, p. 95.

To begin with, there was the Arab rule confined only to
Sind and Multan; it continued for about two centuries. Stanley
Lane-Poole has described it as just 'an episode in the history
of India and Islam, a triumph without results'. Likewise the
Ghaznavid rule in the Punjab was an interlude, managed by a
Hindu governor, appointed by Mahmud. Even the Ghurides,
despite the military exploits of Qutb-ud-din Aybak, could not
extend their dominion beyond north India. The only
exception was Alauddin Khilji who, according to R.C.
Majumdar, "for the first time established Muslim suzerainty
over nearly the whole of India."[^/006004] After him it disintegrated
until the ruler of another dynasty, Muhammad Tughlaq,
expanded his empire up to the farthest end in the south.
He ruled for ten years.

[^/006004]:	Majumdar, R.C., _et al._, _An Advanced History of India_, Madras, 1978, p. 302.

Hence the period of effective and comprehensive Muslim
rule over India from the seventh to the thirteenth century
was barely of thirty years duration. Until the advent of the
Mughals, there was only a semblance of Muslim rule, which
for almost seven centuries covered a part of India, one dynasty
replacing the other and with almost a vacuum from the
eleventh to the thirteenth century, when most of India was
ruled by various Hindu rajas. It is important to bear this in
mind because a wrong impression has been spread among
Hindus that for 700 years, from the invasion of Muhammad
bin Qasim in 711 to the fall of Ibrahim Lodi in 1526, Muslims
ruled over the whole of India, indulging in persecution and
oppression of Hindus, destroying their temples, ill-treating their
womenfolk and extorting taxes from them. This myth has now
been successfully exploded and most historians have accepted
it without reservation.

Babur's invasion was at the invitation of both the Muslim
nobles and the Hindu rajas who conspired against Ibrahim
Lodi. His generals had registered the move but Babur seized
the opportunity of conquering new pastures across the Afghan
borders. He was a refined and cultured individual who enjoyed
the good things of life. His memoirs reflect his liberal and
cosmopolitan approach to men and matters. There is only one
reference to his visit to Gwalior fort which he described as
"wonderful buildings" but found the rooms dark and airless.
He also went to see the valley beneath the fort, visited
the Jain shrines, where he was aghast to see "the idols ... quite
naked, without covering the privities ... I ordered them,
destroyed."

He saw the Hindu temples next and appreciated the beauty
of the idols. He did not ever visit Ayodhya; it was his Shia
general, Mir Baqi who is said to have destroyed the Ram
temple there and built a mosque for the Shias. Babur apparently
had no knowledge about it as there is no reference to it in his
memoirs. It is, therefore, surprising that Babur should be
implicated and maligned in the controversy regarding the
Ram temple and the Babri masjid. There was no trace of
bigotism in Babur and his will, the last testament to his son
Humayun (1508--56), who succeeded him, is a clear refutation
of such a charge.

He wrote:

>Son, this nation Hindustan has different
religions. Thank Allah for giving us this kingdom, we should
remove all the differences from our heart and do justice to
each community according to its customs. Avoid cow-slaughter
to win over the hearts of the people in the matters of
administration. Don't damage the places of worship and
temples which fall in the boundaries of our rule. Evolve a
method of ruling whereby all the people of the kingdom are
happy with the king and the king is happy with the people.
Islam can progress by noble deeds and not by terror. Ignore
the differences of Shia and Sunni as this is the weakness of
Islam; keep the people following different customs integrated
into a single whole so that no part of the body of this kingdom
becomes diseased.

To accuse such an enlightened ruler of the
destruction of a temple is travesty of history.

Humayun followed Babur's testament faithfully; he was
soon overthrown by one of his generals, Sher Shah Suri (154045)
who reigned as an enlightened ruler for some years until
Humayun was able to reclaim the throne with the military
support of Shah Tahmasp of Iran (1524--76). Humayun died
soon thereafter by slipping on the stairs of his library.

His twelve-year-old son Akbar (1556--1605) succeeded him.
Akbar's fifty-year rule is regarded as the hallmark of liberalism
which cemented the relations between Hindus and Muslims
as never before. He showed the highest respect to Hindu
sentiments and traditions; some of the Ulama in fact called
him an enemy of Islam. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi (1564--1624)
carried on a campaign against him. But there are some Hindu
communalists who cast aspersions even on his catholicity and
greatness as a liberal ruler.

Jehangir (1605--27) succeeded Akbar; he was loved by his
subjects for his passion for justice; anyone, Hindu or Muslim,
could go to his palace, pull the chain of justice and demand
that his grievance be redressed. He took personal interest in
every case. He was liberal to the core; he neither built a mosque
nor a temple. Shah Jahan (1628--58) ascended the peacock
throne after Jehangir; he was a lover of art and architecture;
he made no distinction in the treatment of his subjects. Nor
did he allow any temple to be destroyed in his kingdom. In
fact he encouraged his eldest son, Dara Shikoh (1615--59),
whom he had nominated as his successor, to learn Sanskrit
and study the Vedas. Dara Shikoh was attracted to mysticism
and found much in common between Hinduism and Islam;
he elaborated this in his book: Majma' ul-Bahrayn (the mingling
of two oceans) beautifully. Shah Jahan's best gift to India
was the Taj Mahal which is regarded as one of the seven
wonders of the world.

Aurangzeb (1658--1707) intrigued against both his father
Shah Jahan and his brother Dara Shikoh to grab the throne
for himself. He was a puritan in religion and cultivated the
Ulama whom he instigated against Dara Shikoh and with their
help managed to raise his own force to usurp the throne by
getting Dara Shikoh murdered. He also imprisoned Shah Jahan
and kept him confined in a fort for seven years contrary to the
Quranic injunction which makes it obligatory for a son to
look after his parents with honour.

He imposed the rules of Shariah in his empire and levied
jaziya for the first time in the history of the Mughals on the
Hindus. He destroyed many of their temples and was ruthless
in forcing the orthodox regulations on his subjects. He banned
playing of music and fought even against those Muslim
kingdoms which did not subscribe to the puritanical pattern
of his rule. He had to contend with a series of revolts by not
only Hindu rulers but also Muslim nobles. He ruled for fifty
years during which time, he emptied his treasury by his
fanatical functioning and the senseless measures that he
undertook. And thus the great Mughal Empire which Akbar
had so solidly built, began to crumble and soon collapsed.

On the whole, the Great Mughals brought about the best
and the most harmonious relations between Hindus and
Muslims. Sir John Marshall rightly pointed out:

>Seldom in
the history of mankind has the spectacle been witnessed of
two civilizations, so vast and so strongly developed, yet so
radically dissimilar as the Muhammadan and the Hindu,
meeting and mingling together. The very contrasts,
which existed between them, the wide divergences in their
culture and their religions, make the history of their
impact peculiarly instructive.[^/006005]

[^/006005]:	_Ibid_., p. 396.

Sir Jadunath _Sarkar_, the most eminent and highly respected
historian, enumerated in the following words, the benefits of
the Muslim rule to India, while delivering the Sir Mayer
Lectures at the Madras University in March 1928:

i. Restoration of touch with the outer world, which included
the revival of an Indian navy and sea-borne trade, both
of which had been lost since the decline of the Cholas.
ii. Internal peace over a large part of India, especially north
of the Vindhyas.
iii. Uniformity secured by the imposition of the same type
of administration.
iv. Uniformity of social manners and dress among the upper
classes, irrespective of creed.
v. Indo-Saracen art, in which the medieval Hindu and
Chinese schools were blended together. Also, a new style
of architecture, and the promotion of industries of a
refined kind (_e.g._ shawl, inlaying work, kinkhab, muslin,
carpet, and so on).
vi. A common lingua franca, called Hindustani or Rekhta,
and an official prose style (mostly the creation of Hindu
munshis writing Persian, and even borrowed by the
Maratha chitnises for their own vernacular).
vii. Rise of our vernacular literature, as the fruits of peace
and economic prosperity under the Empire of Delhi.
viii. Monotheistic religious revival and Sufism.
ix. Historical literature.
x. Improvements in the art of war and in civilization in
general.

There is also no truth in the contention that the Muslim
rulers were hostile to the scriptures and traditions of the
Hindus. On the contrary a number of their courtiers took pains
to translate the Vedas and the Upanishads into Persian to
acquaint themselves with the beliefs and practices of the
Hindus. The foremost among them was al-Biruni. He extolled
the Hindu concept of God and said like the Muslims, the
Hindus also believed that

>God is eternal, without beginning
and end, acting by free will, almighty, all wise, living, giving
life, ruling, preserving, one who in His sovereignty is unique,
beyond all likeness and unlikeness.[^/006006]

[^/006006]:	Rizvi, S.A.A., _The Wonder That was India_, Vol.II, London, 1987, p. 251.

The famous al-Biruni studied Yoga Sutra and Bhagavad
Gita. He was of the opinion that Hindu idols were "only
memorials". Likewise Amir Khusraw declared that the Hindus
also believed in one God; according to him they worshipped
stones, animals, plants, and the sun as God's creations and
not as God. The great Sufi Gaisu Daraz made a special study
of Sanskrit to better understand the religious beliefs of the
Hindus. The Mughals gave a lot of encouragement to Muslim
scholars to learn Sanskrit and become acquainted with the
Hindu scriptures; Akbar's Maktab Khana specialized in the
learning of the Vedas, the Upanishads and the epics, Ramayana
and Mahabharata. Faizi's Persian translation of the Gita is
still considered a classic. Jehangir gave impetus to the
translation into Persian of Hindu religious works. Dara Shikoh's
interest in the Vedas and the Upanishads was so deep that he
was accused of being half Hindu.

Similarly most Sufis had developed a soft corner for the
teachings of the Hindu rishis and many of the Sufis accepted
Rama and Krishna as the prophets of God. Shaikh Nizamuddin
Awlia of Delhi and Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer were
so attracted by yogic ideas and practices that they even
incorporated them into their teachings. Kabir loved Hindus
and Muslims so dearly that he truly made them think and
live alike. Thus there was continuous intermingling of
thought and mutual contact between Hindus and Muslims
during the Muslim rule. Baba Fighani expressed the mood
of the times thus:

>There is one lamp in this house, by whose rays,
> 
>Wherever I look there is an assembly.[^/006007]

[^/006007]:	_Ibid_., p. 258.

One of the most reliable of contemporary chroniclers,
Ziauddin Barani, a Muslim zealot, committed to the furtherance
of imperial Islam, recorded in deep anguish that the Muslim
rulers were too indulgent towards the Hindus:

>The desire for
>overthrowing infidels and knocking down idolators and
>polytheists does not fill the hearts of the Muslim Kings (of
>India). On the other hand, out of consideration for the fact
>that infidels and polytheists are payers of tribute and protected
>persons (Dhimmis), these infidels are honoured, distinguished,
>favoured and made eminent; the kings bestow drums, banners,
>ornaments, cloaks of brocade and caparisoned horses upon
>them, and appoint them to governorships, high posts and
>offices.
>
>And in their capital (Delhi), owing to the status of
>which the status of all other Muslim cities is raised, Muslim
>kings not only allow but are pleased with the fact that infidels,
>polytheists, idol-worshippers and cow-dung (sargin)
>worshippers build houses like palaces, wear clothes of brocade
>and ride Arab horses caparisoned with gold and silver
>ornaments. They are equipped with a hundred thousand
>sources of strength. They live in delights and comforts. They
>take Mussalmans into their service and make them run before
>their horses. The poor Mussalmans beg of them at their doors;
>and in the capital of Islam, owing to which the edifice of Islam
>is elevated, they are called rais (great rulers), ranas (minor
>rulers), thakurs (warriors), sahas (bankers), mehtas (clerks)
>and pandits (priests). How under these conditions can Faith prevail
>over false creeds or truth be established at the centre.[^/006008]

All through the Mughal rule, except during the time of
Aurangzeb, there was regular participation of Muslims in Hindu
festivals and vice-versa; this has been lucidly elaborated by
P. N. Chopra in The History and Culture of Indian People, he
writes:

>On the occasion of the Dasehra festival, royal
>elephants and horses were washed, groomed, and caparisoned
>to be arrayed for inspection by the Emperor. Diwali or Dipawali
>was observed in much the same manner as it is today; fireworks
>were discharged and sweets and other presents were
>exchanged. Gambling was considered auspicious on this day
>and people kept awake the whole night trying one another's
>luck at dice. Akbar was interested in the festive aspect of the
>celebrations, while Jehangir preferred gambling. Sometimes the
>latter ordered his attendants to play the games, in his presence
>for two or three nights.
>
>During the time of the later Mughals, it appears, the
>permission of the Governor was necessary to hold the Diwali
>fair for which a poll-tax was sometimes levied. Akbar also took
>part in the celebrations of Goverdhan Puja, consisting of
>several cows. Properly washed and ornamented, the cows were
>brought before him for review. Both solar and lunar eclipses
>were observed with all sanctity by the Hindus who fasted
>for 24 hours before the actual eclipse and passed the day in
>prayers. A bath in the Ganges on this occasion was regarded
>as of special merit and large numbers resorted to Hardwar,
>Kashi and Prayag.[^/006009]

Sri Aurbindo, who has a special place in the hearts of all
Hindus and whom even the RSS reveres gives a much more
candid assessment of the Mughal Rule:

>The Mogul empire
was a great and magnificent construction and an immense
amount of political genius and talent was employed in its
creation and maintenance. It was as splendid, powerful and
beneficent and, it may be added, in spite of Aurangzeb's
fanatical zeal, infinitely more liberal and tolerant in
religion than any medieval or contemporary European
kingdom or empire.[^/0060010]

The communal Hindus, in their rage against the Muslims,
disown all this and on the contrary paint almost all Muslim
rulers as the eternal enemies of India, whose ancestors did
nothing but harm every aspect of Hindu religion, culture and
civilization. They deliberately distort not only the positive
achievements of the Muslim rule in every sphere of human
endeavour but also refuse to recognize the vast impact that
Hinduism and Hindus in particular made on the Muslims; they
propagate that Muslims never integrated with the Hindus and
remained aliens all through the ages.

Dr. Muhammad Umar of Aligarh Muslim University has
written an excellent treatise in Urdu wherein he elaborated
the vast impact that Hindu institutions and conventions made
on the habits, customs and rituals of Indian Muslims and on
their outlook of life and their style of living as well. It is titled
Hindustani Tahzeeb ka Mussalmanon pur Asar and deals
exhaustively with every aspect of their relationship. Dr. Umar
has collected valuable material which conclusively demolishes
the Two-Nation theory and brings out in sharp contrast the
deep influence that Hinduism exercised on moulding the
character of Islam in India.

One of the lasting effects of Hinduism on Indian Muslims
has been through the caste system. Despite Islam's emphasis
on the equality of believers, the converted Muslims could not
shed their caste complex. The high-born and low-born among
them retained their classification; they took different
nomenclatures but the old divisions continued. This became
more evident when marriages (between members of different
families) were arranged. For instance, a Sayyid would not marry
a Shaikh or a Mirza or a Pathan. Horoscopes which determine
the marital ties among Hindus, also became a regular feature
among Muslims before deciding on the compatibility of the
couple or on fixing the date of the marriage ceremony. They
also asked for a shajra or family tree.

Many others rituals were also borrowed from the Hindus:
the engagement ceremony, the dressing of the bride and the
bridegroom, the bridal procession with the bridegroom atop
an elephant or a horse, a band accompanying it, the breaking
of a coconut for good luck, the qawwali or other music
programmes, even the mujra or the dance of nautch girls, the
rukhsati or departure of the bride from her home to that of the
bridegroom, with various pranks played on him by her relatives,
all these are features peculiar to Indian Muslims, taken from
the Hindus and have little in common with those of the Arabs
or Iranians or even Turks. The decorating of the palms and
feet of the bride and her relations with mehendi or henna is
also typically Hindu practice, adopted by the Muslims.

There are also other Hindus customs observed by the
Muslims such as the barsi or the annual remembrance of the
dead, when the close relatives go to the grave and place flowers
on it --- a practice which the orthodox Muslims reject as bidat
or innovation. There is yet another custom, which is taken
from the Hindus and that is a child's initiation into learning,
called Bismillah; this is similar to what is performed by a Hindu
child while being sent to a pathshala. Elaborate preparations
are made and relatives gather to see and hear the child utter
the first word followed by feasting and rejoicing as among the
Hindus. The Sufis too were greatly influenced by their contact
with their Hindu disciples. They valued the Vedanta
philosophy and the mystical teachings of the Upanishads.

Jinnah talked of Hindu heroes being different from Muslim
heroes; so too are the heroes of the Gujaratis different from
those of the Maharashtrians and of the Punjabis from the
Tamilians and of the Bengalis from the Biharis. There are plenty
of differences among different sects and groups, casteist or
linguistic; but there are also many common bonds. Similar is
the case between Hindus and Muslims. Gandhi, Nehru and
Azad stressed on these bonds while Jinnah harped on the
differences. He said the style of living of the two communities
was different. Superficially there may be some differences but,
by and large, especially in the villages, they live and socialize
in such harmony and camaraderie that it is difficult to
distinguish a Hindu from a Muslim.

Similarly, there has been much fusion of Hindu and Muslim
designs and workmanship in architecture. For instance the
Qutb Minar which is embellished with Quranic verses, has its
ornamentation copied from Hindu jewellery. In the QuwatulIslam
mosque the motifs are both Indian and Iranian. The
arches in the tomb of Balban, now in ruins, also showed the
same influence. Even Firuz Tughlaq (r.1351--88), despite his
religious orthodoxy, used Hindu columns in madrasas. In the
Tantipura mosque of Gaur the columns are exact replicas of
those in the temples. The same design is noticed in what are
called the Elephant Stables. This harmonious blending had
its full flowering under the Mughals. Akbar's Fort at Agra has
drawn extensively from the architecture of the Elephant
Gateway in Gwalior. It became a precursor, depicting motifs of
birds and animals, which were frowned upon by the mullahs.
In the Panch Mahal, there are carvings showing Rama being
worshipped by Hanuman. In several other Mughal monuments
which are Islamic in conception and design, the Hindu
influence is fairly prominent.

Painting is disapproved of by the Muslim devout; it is
supposed to encourage idol worship. However it continued to
flourish in Iran even after the advent of Islam and in India
both the Turks and the Mughals patronized it. This received
the greatest impetus in the reign of Akbar which saw a
fascinating blend of Iranian and Indian art visible in many
works of that period. Some of the outstanding painters of his
court were both Hindus and Muslims --- Kalyan Das, Anup
Chitre, Rai Anup and Manohar and Muhammad Nadir, Mir
Hashim and Faqirullah Khan. Abul Fazl mentions them and
extols the patronage bestowed on them by Akbar who was as
generous to the Hindu artists as to the Muslims. The Mughal
miniature reflects the distinctively Indian genius; it flowered
also during the reigns of Jehangir, Shah Jahan and even in the
early years of Aurangzeb.

Like painting, music is also looked down upon by the
Muslim puritan; but because of the Sufis it acquired
acceptability. Iraq and Syria, which were under Byzantine
domination before their conquest by the Arabs and conversion
to Islam, were responsible for changing the Muslim outlook.
and bringing it closer to the ancient Iranian heritage. The
same happened in India; many of the Hindu customs were
absorbed by the Sufis. The courts of the Khiljis and other Delhi
sultans revelled in ancient Hindu arts, as observed by Barani.
Hindu musicians and dancers became the favourites of Muslim
rulers and they were regularly eulogized by the Muslim nobility
who gave them financial support.

Amir Khusraw admitted that the Muslim arts were
transformed by Hindu influence; it played a phenomenal part
in music and dance. Even the Sufis found the Hindu forms
and tunes much more congenial and effective for their
devotional practices than the Iranian ones with their Muslim
overtones. Out of their interaction, new melodies and tunes
were born. Tarana is, for instance, akin to ullana and qawwali
is the result of this fusion; it adapts Indian rhythms to Persian
and Arabic forms. One of Akbar's navratan or "nine jewels",
the legendary singer Tansen (1555--1610) captivated the
Muslims as much as the Hindus at Akbar's court. Tansen
borrowed heavily from the musical rhythms of Persia. Even
the Vijayanagar court gave full play to the mingling of Hindu
music with that of Iran and Arabia. These traditions were
passed down from generation to generation with the result
that today some of the greatest exponents of Indian music and
dance are Muslims.

These are facts which establish beyond doubt that there is
far more in common, in every sphere, between Hindus and
Muslims than the differences that divide them. Jinnah stressed
the differences to suit his political purpose; but the ties are
enduring; they demolish his theory that religion can be the
basis of nationality; neither the Quran nor the Prophet has
stated it; that is why even Arabs practising the same religion
and speaking the same language but living in different parts of
the world could not become one nation; nor have they been
able to integrate with Iranians or Malaysians or Indonesians,
or any one of them with the other. Muslim brotherhood is a
myth; more blood has been shed by Muslims of Muslims than
of non-Muslims. Likewise pan-Islamism has been talked
about by several enthusiastic devouts; but it has never worked
in practice. Muslims of the world may sometimes meet
together but they never unite in action. Indian Muslims have
always been a group apart; they have never asked nor
invited to participate in any of the collective deliberations
of the Muslim world.
