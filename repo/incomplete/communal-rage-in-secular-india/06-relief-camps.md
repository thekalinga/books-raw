# Relief Camps

The tragedy of the victims of the genocide was multiplied
when they were sent to the few relief camps that were
set-up for them mostly by unofficial agencies. The attitude of
the Government to the running of these camps was pathetic.
The compensation that it promised to the victims of the carnage
was half of what was given to the victims of Godhra. The
material supplied to the camps was also insufficient to the
growing needs of the sufferers who came from Ahmedabad,
Vadodara and other affected cities. Even the appeal for funds
was not heeded by the public; the response was cold and dismal.

_The Times of India_ came out with a severely critical editorial;
it deprecated the callousness of concerned citizens to the relief
funds floated by various welfare organizations. It wrote:

>The
contrast couldn't be more stark. Flashback to the Gujarat
earthquake in 2001. In a magnificent outpouring of
compassion, India rose as one to rush relief supplies to the
affected. It was a reaffirmation of the human spirit of concern
for fellow citizens. Yet today, when an entirely avoidable tragedy
is being played out in Gujarat, that fellow feeling is singularly
lacking.[^/003001]

[^/003001]:	_The Times of India_, March 28, 2002.

The Editors' Guild in its report had noted that
newspapers in India had not started relief funds for the victims
of Gujarat as they did for every calamity in the past; this also
applied to the electronic media; they were perhaps
apprehensive that their effort would not receive the necessary
support from readers and viewers.

The condition within the relief camps was also most
distressing; according to _The Times of India_:

>Today tens of
thousands of terrified riot survivors are huddled in makeshift
camps, even more have sought refuge in the homes of relatives.
The only help that these desperate people are getting is from
needy members of their own community, many of whom have
lost their homes and loved ones in these riots. A cynical
political class has sought to explain its unforgivable apathy
with the question 'What about the victims of Godhra'?

They
were officially looked after but as the newspaper pointed out:

>The task of rehabilitating the victims of Gujarat is
monumental. It will involve reconstruction of homes and
finding work in the face of the Sangh's call to boycott Muslim
businesses and deny work to them. Above all, it will involve
counselling to overcome the trauma of having witnessed
unspeakable horrors. Perhaps nothing will completely heal
these scars, but the message going out to Gujarat is that India
simply does not care.[^/003002]

[^/003002]:	_Ibid_.

Even the findings of the National Human Rights
Commission, which recorded in terrifying detail the vicious
barbarism to which the helpless minority was subjected, did
not move many in the country; those who spoke, were either
ignored or what they said did not produce any tangible benefits
for them. The perpetrators of the massacre of the innocents
went about happily with their barbaric acts. There had never
been such lack of sympathy on the part of civil society; it
showed that hatred had penetrated so deep that it had destroyed
civil values and humanitarian concern for even the sick and
the wounded, the aged and the infants.

Many sensitive Hindus were no doubt shocked at what
they saw, heard and read. Shobhaa De, the celebrated novelist
wrote bitterly against all those who demeaned themselves by
refusing to come forward to help the sufferers. She wrote in
her column:

>I asked prominent influential and affluent
Gujaratis why they hadn't mobilized resources to help the
affected victims of their home state. Why the silence? Why
the passivity? Why the indifference? Didn't it matter? In the
past, the community had been instantly galvanized into taking
prompt action --- money by the millions, fund-raising shows,
volunteers, food, clothes, donations, medicines. This time there
was just silence. An extraordinary response from a community
that prides itself on its ethnic identity. What on earth had
happened to the Gujjus? The generous Gujjus? Where had
fellow-feeling gone?

She asked especially the business.
community:

>Where are the mighty captains of industry? A
few did speak up. But sorry to say, those carefully prepared
statements sounded alarmingly political. Even hollow. The
ones whose voices were heard, seemed to have an agenda of
their own that went beyond plain decency and human
concern.[^/003003]

[^/003003]:	_The Times of India_, April 28, 2002.

The rest of the people in high places in other states
also showed the same lack of sympathy as if the suffering in
Gujarat was of no concern to them. It made one wonder
whether the unity of India was indeed hollow.

Shobhaa De narrated the reaction of a councillor from
Delhi who was stricken by what she experienced in some relief
camps outside Ahmedabad. She told De:

>For the first time I
felt I needed trauma counselling myself. I couldn't sleep at
night ... the horror of those terrible images kept coming back
to me.[^/003004]

[^/003004]:	_Ibid_.

Why was there this cold silence? This apathy? This
callousness on the part of those who had never failed to rise to
such occasions in the past. The reason was obvious; it was
because this time most of the sufferers were Muslims; even
those Hindus who wanted to help feared that their gesture
would be misunderstood by their co-religionists who had
decided that Muslims were a dangerous people who had
to be annihilated. Any form of assistance to them would
be misconstrued as communal by their friends and supporters.
To what mean level had even some of the concerned
citizens fallen?

The condition in the various relief camps, according to all
accounts, was miserable. It is well-known that right from the
beginning, the official attitude about these camps had been
most unhelpful. In fact many of them especially ministers had
publicly asked for disbanding them saying their continuance
would provoke communal disturbance. Agonizing stories were
reported about the pathetic manner in which these camps
were run; they were said to be not only short of food and
utensils, but even water. For a measly meal, the inmates had
to wait in a queue for hours together. Even infants and children,
crying for milk, were left unattended. Essentials were in short
supply; the victims went from place to place asking for basic
requirements but they would get no response. NGOs working
in such relief camps, were shocked by what officials bluntly told
them --- they would be happy if the victims died.

At one of the biggest rallies held in recent years in Delhi to
protest against the genocide in Gujarat, Maulana Asad Madani,
President of Jamiat-ulUlama told the victims of violence that it
did not matter if one or two lakhs of them died but unity between
Muslims and _Dalits_ should be preserved. What a shocking
statement! What the Muslims in Gujarat faced was the threat to
their very existence; the unity between Muslims and _Dalits_ was
irrelevant to what they were going through. Moreover the Maulana
forgot that in the massacre and loot of the Muslims in Gujarat,
the _Dalits_ were in the forefront. They were assisted by the police
who admitted that they killed more Muslims than Hindus.
_Hindustan Times_ reported: "Out of the 184 people who died in
police firing since the violence began, 104 are Muslims".[^/003005]

Priyanka Kakodkar gave a grim picture of the trauma that
the children, orphaned by the holocaust went through in the
relief camps:

>When night falls, a quiet fear invades the smoky
relief camps in Ahmedabad. For the children of the Gujarat
riots, the witching hour has begun. In the slow hours till dawn,
many huddle close to their mothers, struggling to stay awake.
The horrific memories that they try to hold at bay during the
day stalk them in their sleep. For the riot's children, there is a
thin dividing line between memories and nightmares. There
are visions of parents being dragged out of their homes and
cut into pieces, of brothers and sisters thrown into flames. There
are memories of women being brutally raped, foetuses ripped
from pregnant bellies and of their own spine-chilling escapes
from imminent death.[^/003006]

[^/003006]:	_Outlook_, May 13, 2002.

There were some 42,000 children
among the over 1 lakh inmates in Gujarat's relief camps. Those
working in the field --- civil rights groups, NGOs --- said there.
were at least 30,000 children in Ahmedabad's camps alone.
Many of them were orphans who had lost all their relatives.
They had been worst affected by the carnage. Unlike adults,
they could not fully absorb or vocalize what they saw. But the
impact on them was the deepest.

According to Dr. R.S. Srinivasa Murthy, professor of
psychiatry at the Bangalore-based National Institute of Mental
Health and Neurosciences:

>First came the mobs --- burning,
pillaging, murdering and raping in front of the eyes of these
hapless children. Then came displacement --- after their homes
were torched. Suddenly, family, friends and schools are a
chimera.

Analysing the terrible effect on the children, Dr.
Srinivasa observed:

>The trauma seen in children who survived
the riots in Gujarat is similar to the trauma children suffered
after the Bhopal gas tragedy, the Uttarkashi earthquake and
the earthquake in the state. So they ended up extremely prone
to anxiety disorders, acute depression and stress.[^/003007]

[^/003007]:	_Ibid_.

It was possibly even worse. The Ahmedabad-based NGO
Centre For Development tried to involve the camp children
in art classes but they ended up drawing burning houses and
dead people. "There is a lot of anger among the children,"
said Mira Mehta of the Centre. "You will see a lot of small,
silent children playing around in the camps. They don't look
rattled but they are badly affected inside." That's not hard to
discover. A three-year-old boy playing in the camp said
occasionally: Abba ko mar diya. goli, goli! (They killed my father;
bullet, bullet!) No amount of counselling would have helped,
said psychiatrists: "There is so much fear and anger among
children that we can't even tell them that it is all over. Until it
stops, how can they begin healing?"[^/003008] asked Sandhya
Surendradas of the NGO, Sanchetna's Child Survival Project.

[^/003008]:	_Ibid_.

Apart from the Muslims in the relief camps bearing the
hardship of living in the most miserable conditions, those
Muslims who were outside fared no better. Their houses were
destroyed, their businesses looted; they had nowhere to go,
they went in search of some work to sustain themselves, but
no one came forward to oblige them. The daily wage-earners
continued to starve; they could not venture out and find work
in the dangerous environment outside Muslim localities. Shafi
Madani, chairman of Islami Relief Committee, Gujarat (IRCG)
which had been involved in relief work ever since the outbreak
of the riots mentioned that his unit provided food to thousands
of sufferers; but the number went on increasing. They could
not provide for all hence many died of starvation.

_Frontline_, the fortnightly owned by the Hindu newspaper
and edited by N. Ram, gave a graphic account of the state of
affairs in the relief camps. It reported:

>Around 1.5 lakh refugees
are stranded in Gujarat's relief camps. Several people die in
continuing violence every day, adding to the toll which has
already crossed 800. Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Bajrang
Dal and the Bharatiya Janata Party workers stand accused of
having orchestrated targeted attacks against Muslims across
the State, killing them and hounding them out of their villages
and ghettos. The attacks continue relentlessly in Ahmedabad.
and other parts of north and central Gujarat. The police barge
into Muslim homes and harass residents as part of the combing
operations. Village residents whose homes have been destroyed
are living in open fields. There is no way out for the homeless
refugees in relief camps. They cannot return to their homes or
start work again.[^/003009]

[^/003009]:	_Frontline_, May 10, 2002.

The District Collectors urged the people in
the camps to return to their homes, assuring them of security
but nobody went back as they did not trust the local police
and were afraid of the mobs.

Bismillah Khan, the Bharat Ratna awardee, returned to
the Baska relief camp from a meeting at his Rameshra village
in Halol on April 12, disappointed that the local leaders had
not shown up. But little did he know then that his house and
the houses of two others were burnt soon after he left the
village, as he made his way back to the relief camp that night.
It was an unspoken message to stay away. On the night before
the next meeting scheduled for April 16, three more houses
were set on fire. "How can they return when the police have
done nothing to make sure they would be safe, when their
houses and shops have been totally destroyed" asked the great
maestro. Others who attempted to return also ran back to the
relief camps. Alibhai Rehman Khatri's Hindu friends from
Rawalia village, visited him at the Baska relief camp and
convinced him to return and reopen his shop. "I took a loan
of Rs. 6,000, stocked the shop with supplies and reopened
my shop for eight days," he said. "Then there was a Bajrang
Dal meeting in a nearby village, where they apparently
planned to burn my shop and kill me because I had the guts
to return'."[^/0030010] He stayed behind in the camp. Meanwhile his
shop was looted and burnt.

[^/0030010]:	_Ibid_.

In many places, even police escorts proved to be of no use.
For instance, they took Pathan Jafar Khan back to his home
in Baranpura, Vadodara, to assess the damage. 'While they
were filing the report, a mob attacked them from all sides. The
policemen ran away. Those in the Special Reserve Police tent
stationed there refused to come out and help. Likewise
Mehboob Sheikh from Kanvat village wanted to return but
the police warned him that it would not be safe for him. These
cases are illustrative of what was the situation all around.

Even though relief camps were the only refuge for the
victims officials were keen to reduce their numbers and close
down most of them. But as the flow of victims was unending,
they could not do it. Vadodara bristled with looters; other
places were no better. In Bamanwad village, in Panchmahal
district, a mob of arsonists destroyed 27 houses; people were so
frightened that they slept in open fields. In relief camps in
Ahmedabad, hundreds of young students were housed but they
were scared to travel to examination centres where mobs ruled
the streets. The police and the Rapid Action Force had to
struggle hard to rescue them. Many of them could not, therefore,
appear for their examinations.

The well-known painter and social activist Anjolie Ela
Menon gave a heart-rending account of what she saw in the
relief camps:

>Yes, like so many of us, I too postponed the
moment of reckoning for two whole months. But until we
touch them in the flesh, see them with our own eyes, hold
their hands in our hands, hear their cries of despair, they remain
a statistic in the morning paper, pawns in the games of
politicians. They are far removed from us, creating no
disturbance in our daily lives.

She continued to narrate:

>In
the relief camp in Ahmedabad I am aghast at the numbers. I
am deeply humbled that someone rushes to offer me cold water.
How can I accept this when right at the entrance of the
makeshift office, a 10-day-old baby lies on the bare floor beside
its mother while the grandmother fans the flies off it in a gesture
that speaks of both love and despair. Despair is the flavour of
the morning, it wafts across the compound perceptibly. Outside,
hundreds of women sit on gunny sacks under a thin cotton
canopy. It is 45 degrees and blisteringly hot. Not a fan in sight.
The children run about with great abandon, mercifully gifted
with amnesia ... I put my arms around one woman who is
weeping and 20 others just want a hug, to be comforted even
if I can't offer them hope, justice, money, freedom.

Menon went round the camps and was alarmed at what
she saw:

>The good intentions of the managers
notwithstanding, it is sheer bedlam in the camps. The women
sit around the whole day under the shamianas, or out in the
open in some camps, the kids run wild and the men hang
around in sullen groups. Yet, despite the nightmarish
conditions in the camps, the prospect of their closure is even
more terrible. These are people who have lost everything ---
homes, breadwinners, jobs, possessions. If they don't get attacked
by a hostile neighbour they will perish from sheer want. The
question each one asks is, 'where will we go from here'?[^/0030011]

[^/0030011]:	_The Times of India_, May 16, 2002.

Pankaj Shankar, the well-known film maker, has made an
exhaustive film on the riots; it starts with the caption:

>As you
watch this film, someone is being set on fire in the name of
faith.

It has captured the hideous face of communal conflict
at its worst --- burnt houses, looted shops, charred bodies of
victims and testimonies of four-year-old children who saw with
their own eyes their mothers and sisters being raped and then
burnt. Shankar, who had gone to Gujarat to film the Gujarat
riots for Channel 4, said:

>Initially it was to be a film on the
riots for commercial use. But when I was assaulted by the police
for the first time there for trying to report the truth and also
after seeing the hideous face of crime on the pretext of
religious faith, I could not help but decide to dedicate the
film to the victims of riots.

He took over a month and a half to make the film, moving
through the villages of Modana, Himmatnagar and
Sabarkhana, where destroyed properties, corpses and charred
bodies stood testimony to the crimes committed.

>One Muslim
lady in the film asks 'kya _sarkar_ sirf apke liye hai, hamara liye
nahi kyun ki hum Muslim hain?'. This haunted me for a long
time. And that is when the question came to my head whether
I should support the Hindus who helped Muslims during the
riots or whether I am on the side of Hindus who spearheaded
the riots. In several villages I saw a message Yeh gaon Hindu
rashtra hai. Agar muslimon ko rehna hai to unhe teen cheesen
manna hai --- masjid nahi bana sakenge, azaan nahi denge aur
daari nahi rakhenge.

Meanwhile, renowned filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt, who has
also been a witness to riots during his frequent visits there in
the first two months of the genocide also returned from Gujarat
and was present at the film show. He said:

>I want all the
Muslims in India not to confuse Hindus of Gujarat who carried
out the carnage against them, with the secular character of
India. The main evil is not done by people of the carnage but
by people like us who are quiet even after that. We are solely
responsible for the genocide in Gujarat because we aren't
stopping it. Indifference and apathy on our side is responsible
for this genocide.[^/0030012]

[^/0030012]:	_The Asian Age_, April 30, 2002.

Even after the passage of three months Muslim refugees in
the relief camps were frightened to return to their homes; the
communal Hindus had made it clear that in case they came
back, they would meet the same fate as before. In the camps
the conditions continued to be awful; water and food were
contaminated; many of them had caught diseases, which could
not be attended to because there were insufficient number of
doctors or medicines available. Hundreds of babies were born
in the camps, but many died because of lack of supply of milk
and due to severe heat. As for men and women, many of them
had become mentally ill; they suffered from depression, pains,
acute vomiting and dizziness. Women who were raped and
children who were attacked, relived the nightmares of seeing
the brutal killings of their fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers;
they could no longer behave normally. They were in a state of
helplessness and despair; this gave rise to severe trauma and
anger in them. The living felt that dying was preferable; not
many were there to wipe their tears and rebuild their
confidence. They had lost the zest for living; their existence
had become meaningless. They lived waiting to die.

Even after the lapse of four months, the conditions in the
camps continued to be most deplorable. The former Foreign
Secretary, Muchkund Dubey and the noted social activist,
Syeda Hameed who visited some of these camps were horrified
at what they saw:

>Conditions in the camps are abysmal. In
Baqar Shah Roza, people are living, eating, sleeping and
defecating under the pouring rains. Shelters in the form of
plastic sheet roofing have been provided mostly by NGOs
such as CARE and Action Aid. With the heavy downpour,
the camp sites are inundated with rain water due to bad drainage.
Rainwater running over the mud and filth, has turned parts
of the camps into dirty lakes in which we found scores of
children splashing and playing at the risk of contracting
water borne diseases.[^/0030013]

[^/0030013]:	_Mainstream_, July 13, 2002.

They were brought from one hell
and put into another.

All the visitors, Indians or foreigners who visited these
camps have told the same sordid tales; the agony and the misery
of the victims went on increasing as time passed. Hence Harsh
Mander, the bureaucrat who resigned because he could not
bear to witness the inhumanity being committed all around
him, asked some pertinent questions:

>Is it that we are too
busy or frightened or prejudiced to reach out and heal? In this
vast land, can the governments and the people not find the
moral and financial resources to assuage the agony of tens of
thousands of innocent women and men, girls and boys, utterly
traumatized and rendered destitute? Can we together rebuild
not only their shelters and livelihoods but also their trust, spirit
and hope? Is the suffering of some people less important because
they are children of a lesser god? Or is it that we have lost our
capacity to care?[^/0030014]
