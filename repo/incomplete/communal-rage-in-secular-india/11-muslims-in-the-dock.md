# Muslims in the Dock

Ignorance, it is said, is bliss; but for Indian Muslims, the
ignorance of communal Hindus about Islam has been
staggering. Every now and then they are asked to define the
word kafir and to explain whether it applied to the Hindus. In
the first place the term is not derogatory; secondly no
responsible Indian Muslim, to the best of my knowledge, has
used it for Hindus. Are words like atheist or agonistic
derogatory? Nehru proudly claimed that he was an agonistic;
Lenin that he was an atheist. In the medieval ages the courtiers
of some Muslim rulers referred to Hindus as kafirs; but why
should the present generation of Muslims be castigated for it?
The logic behind such a perception, especially on the part of
some fanatic Hindus, is that Muslims are taught by their religion
to be contemptuous of Hindus and Hinduism; that is not true.

The truth, on the contrary, is that a section of Hindus
have all along borne a certain contempt for the Muslims; the
Madan and Sri Krishna Commissions have testified that police
officers, during the riots, referred to the Muslims as landyas
while giving instructions to their subordinates. Muslims are
often called by their Hindu detractors as melechch. Even during
the heyday of the Muslim rule, the eminent chronicler alBiruni
reported that Hindus had "the most inveterate aversion
towards all Muslims". Ibn Batuta, after his travels through
various parts of India, wrote that no Muslim was allowed to
enter the house of a Hindu or given food in their vessels. He
observed: "If a Muslim is fed out of their vessel, they either
break the vessel or give it away to Muslims."

The term kafir is derived from the word kufr which means
"to hide or cover up"; it is used for disbelievers --- those who
deny the existence and unity of God. The Quran devotes a
chapter to them which is called surah al-Kafirun. It is, in fact,
a charter of co-existence guaranteeing freedom of worship. In
surah al-Kafirun, verse 2 to 6, Allah commends Muhammad
to tell the disbelievers:

>I do not worship
>
>What you worship
>
>Nor do
>
>you worship
>
>What I worship;
>
>I will not worship
>
>What you worship
>
>Nor will you worship
>
>What I worship;
>
>To you, your religion
>
>And to me, mine.

Hence the term kafir does not apply to Hindus because
most of them believe in the oneness of God; those who do not
are termed kafirs, but the Quran has made it clear that they
can freely go about their own way. There is a well-known
Quranic injunction in surah al-Baqara, verse 256: "There is
no compulsion in religion". In the Encyclopaedia of Islam which
gives a long survey of the use of kafir through the ages, there is
no mention of its application to Hindus.

In Islam non-Muslims are called dhimmis; this is a highly
respected term. It means the "protected ones". The Prophet
said that any Muslim who ill-treated non-Muslims would be
answerable to God on the Day of Judgement and that he
himself would stand up for them. And yet some Muslim rulers
defied these injunctions and perpetrated atrocities against the
Hindus, who are no less dhimmis than the Christians and the
Jews. The Quran specifically mentions that there is no land
where God has not sent his messengers with the book of truth;
in that case how could such a vast subcontinent be deprived
of His revelations? That is why some Ulama accepted the Vedas
as divinely inspired and Rama and Krishna as Prophets. Further,
the faithful are warned that they should make no distinction
between one prophet or another. One of the greatest religious
leaders of the Middle Ages, Mazhar Jan-i-Janan had even
declared that Hindus could be considered as ahlul kitab or
"People of the Book" as they had the Vedas.

The poet-philosopher of modern Islam, Allama Iqbal was
so moved by the Gayatri Mantra that he translated it in Urdu
verse and in the introduction, he affirmed that Hindus could not
be considered as kafirs as they believed in the supremacy of God.

There is then the theory, propounded by the orientalists,
and thoughtlessly advanced by the so-called _jihadis_ that Islam
condones, nay encourages, terrorism on the grounds that the
Quran sanctions violence. It is accepted by communal Hindus
and propagated ceaselessly against the Muslims. It is a corollary
of the same allegation that Islam gave only two choices to the
people: the Quran or the sword. It has also been deliberately used
against Muslims by some of the western historians. The Quran
itself refutes it. In surah al-Shura, verse 40, the faithful are told:

>The recompense for an injury
>
>Is injury equal to one received;
>
>However, if the injured
>
>Forgives and offers reconciliation
>
>Then his reward is from God
>
>For God loves all those
>
>Who refrain from doing wrong.

In verse 43 in the same surah it is further clarified:

>Indeed if you show
>
>Patience and forgive
>
>Then that would indeed be
>
>An act of courage;
>
>It will smoothen the conduct of affairs.

There are many other verses deprecating violence and
emphasizing the virtues of compassion and forgiveness. In surah
Ha Mim, verses 34 and 35, the believers are instructed:

>Virtue and vice can never be the same,
>
>Then repel vice by virtue;
>
>In the end this will prove better
>
>For enemies will then become friends.
>
>And hatred forever will disappear.

The Prophet advised his followers that even aggressors
should be befriended. When asked why, he replied that it was
the best way to deter them from committing further aggression.
There are several traditions in a similar vein. Two of the
Prophet's oft-repeated sayings are:

* He who shows no compassion to his fellow beings will
  receive no compassion from the Almighty; and
* He who does not love God's creatures will forfeit His love.

From the saints and priests in the West to intellectuals like
Voltaire and Dante, Islam has been damned in the most virulent
terms; this continues to be their constant refrain. It is, therefore,
strange to read, as a leading Dutch newspaper has said, that
criticism of Islam in the present crisis should not be taboo.
Even today a scholar of international fame like Samual
Huntington, the author of the earth-shaking book The Clash
of Civilization has stated:

>The doctrines of Islam, it is argued,
dictate war against unbelievers, and when the initial expansion
of Islam tapered off, Muslim groups, quite contrary to the
doctrine, then fought among themselves. The ratio of fatwa
or internal conflicts to _jihad_ shifted drastically in favour of the
former. The Quran and other statements of Muslim beliefs
contain few prohibitions on violence, and a concept of nonviolence
is absent from Muslim doctrine and practice.

I asked the professor when he had dinner with me in my
home in January 1998 whether he had read the Quran and
he admitted that he had not. He went by what some of the
orientalists had written about Islam. However not being aware
of what the Quran truly preaches, Huntington remarked:

>The
demographic explosion in Muslim societies and the availability
of large numbers of often unemployed males between the ages
of fifteen and thirty is a natural source of instability and
violence, both within Islam and against non-Muslims.
Whatever other causes may be at work, this factor alone would
go a long way to explaining Muslim violence in the eighties
and nineties.[^/008001]

In the history of Islam there was only one sect called Nizari
Ismaili who pioneered the movement for terrorism. Its
charismatic leader was Hasan-al-Sabbah (d.1124). His followers
were trained to kill targeted individuals. They were given
"hashish" from which the word "assassin" was drawn. To lure
them to become martyrs, a "Garden of Paradise" was built,
where sumptuous foods, drinks and women were provided for
them. They were intoxicated and made to believe that when
they died while accomplishing their entrusted task, they would
go to heaven, where all these "fruits of enjoyment" awaited
them. One of their victims was the Nizamul Malik --- Prime
Minister. Many other leaders put to death by them; even
SaladÄ±n was on their list, who miraculously escaped their attack.
Their chosen target was the castle at Alamout. They had
created such terror in the elitist class that Imam Ghazali (1058--1111), acclaimed by Muslims as the greatest Imam of all times,
warned Muslims that if they did not destroy terrorism, terrorism
would destroy them, adding that it violated every Quranic
percept and tradition of the Prophet. Finally, Halaku, the
brother of Ghengiz Khan invaded the hideout of the assassins
in the mountains and killed every one of them thus destroying
their murderous network.

Terrorism has now raised its murderous head once again;
it received the greatest impetus in Pakistan where the ISI
organized the so-called _jihadis_ and trained them in the name
of Islam to operate first in Afghanistan and then in India. They
were so motivated that they believed that even if they died,
heaven was assured for them. So strong was this religious
doctrination, distorting Quranic verses and the traditions of
the Prophet that hundreds of young Muslims volunteered to
enlist and agreed to kill and be killed. Madrasas were
established, where diabolical training for such heinous
operations was given. In the result, dozens of them killed
innocent men, women and children and in turn most of them
were done to death. Their acts of terror have generated a wave
of hatred against Muslims amongst non-Muslims making their
very existence vulnerable. Islam has been maligned and
Muslims are being looked down upon as potential murderers
who are supposed to believe that killing of non-Muslims would
guarantee them a place in paradise. This belief is an
unwarranted slur on Islam and a gross distortion of its teachings.

Fatwa is an innovation; it has no religious sanctity. It is the
opinion of a religious dignitary --- a _Mufti_ who gives his
interpretation of a religious tenet, especially the one which
has a legal bearing. That was its origin; but it degenerated into
a weapon in the hands of vested interests to settle scores with
their opponents. It has consequently been used by some
Muslims to serve their particular interest or purpose.

During the heyday of Muslim rule, under the Umayyids,
the Abbasids or the Ottomans, fatwa assumed the form of an
institution which the ruler used to give a religious colour to
his decree; it was reinforced by the opinion of a _Mufti_ who
was generally the ruler's appointee; The Fatwa-i-Alamgiri was
the handiwork of the muftis, appointed by Aurangzeb, whose
decrees were highly rated because they were appreciated and
approved by the emperor, a strict puritan in religious matters.
There was hardly a tinge of liberalism in these fatwas; hence
they lost their importance with the passage of time. No one
refers to them or relies on them these days.

It must, however, be admitted that in recent times some of
the clerics have been misusing the grant of fatwas more for
earning some money than performing a religious duty. In the
process they have exploited the poor and illiterate Muslims,
who ask them whether they are on the right path in their dayto-day
life; all kinds of questions are asked, many personal
and even trivial; for instance quaries are on what should be
the length of the beard or whether one should keep a
moustache or what should be the length of the pyjama (below
or above the ankle) or should one urinate sitting or standing
or when and how should one cohabit with one's wife. The
clerics have made a regular business out of their replies or socalled
fatwas and there is a small section of Muslims who falls
a prey to their tactics.

Some Hindus believe that fatwas are "Shariah-in-action" and
are weapons which are often used to create mischief between
Hindus and Muslims and provoke disharmony in the country.
Their fears are, however, misplaced; no Muslim takes these fatwas
seriously; they are sometimes publicized to harass those Muslims
whom the orthodox try to malign; in the last century fatwas
were issued against even eminent persons. For instance Sir Sayyid
Ahmad Khan, the tallest Muslim leader in the late nineteenth
century, and the founder of the Aligarh Muslim University, was
issued a fatwa brought by his opponents from the Grand Imam
of the mosque in the Kaaba which decreed that the Sayyid
should be killed for having advised Muslims to dine with
Christians and for advocating the promotion of English
education. Similarly, Allama Iqbal was also declared a kafir
in a fatwa issued by a well-known kazi of Sialkot for having
written poems in praise of Rama and Moses and extolling
the vedic prayer, the Gayatri Mantra. These were just
ignored by the Muslims and had no effect on those against
whom they were issued.

There is the widely-spread misconception among the
Hindus that Islam advocates the destruction of their idols.
There is no basis to it. Islam, no doubt, opposes idol-worship;
but so do Christianity and Judaism as also several sects among
Jains, Buddhists and even Hindus. But the Hindu ire is directed
only against Muslims. This has led the Hindus to believe
wrongly that Islam is fundamentally opposed to Hinduism.
Islam's opposition to idol-worship has a historical background.
The idol-worshippers of Mecca, whom the Prophet
_encountered_, were different from Hindu idol-worshippers who
do not deny the existence of one Super Being, though they
call Him by different names. The idols of seventh-century
Arabia represented tribal rivalry. That is why the gods and
goddesses of these various tribes were constantly at war with
one another. The tribals did not accept the supremacy and
oneness of God; nor did they distinguish between good and
bad, virtue and vice. They prided themselves on the exhibition
of brute force, glorifying warfare. They practised infanticide
and treated women as chattels.

The pagan Arabs had no book to guide them. The Hindus
have a series of scriptures. The earliest were the Vedas which
focused on the belief of one God. He was sometimes called
Varuna, sometimes Indra and sometimes Agni; but finally they
all agreed to call Him the Supreme Being, Prajapati or
Viswakarma. This trend is also reflected in the ruins of
Mohenjo-daro whose inhabitants worshipped one God rather
than a multiplicity of gods. They styled Him as Om. Maulana
Azad pointed out:

>They believed that, this Being ruled over
everything that submitted to the law of life devised by Him
and that His attribute is Vedukum or 'eternal wakefulness'.[^/008002]

Then came the doctrine of Brahman and Atman of the
Upanishads. The Brahman was also the one Supreme Being
hidden in all beings, all-pervading, the self within all beings,
watching over all works, dwelling in all beings, the witness,
the perceiver, the only one, free from all qualities.

[^/008002]:	Azad, Abul Kalam, _The Tarjuman al-Quran_, Vol. 1, Bombay, 1962, p. 103.

There is, therefore, an acceptance of monotheism among
Hindus also though it is not as pronounced as among Muslims.
Expounding the philosophy of Adi Sankara, the Sankaracharya
of Kanchi, Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati explained that
according to the shastras,

>Paramesvara, who is one, makes
Himself into three. At three times He puts on three different
guises ... for performing the functions of creation, preservation
and destruction.

The Sankaracharya has further elaborated.

> ... one who says that Visnu is great and is different from Siva ...
is wrong. God has power which is more than what we possess.
In fact He is omnipotent, therefore, at the same time He takes
on different forms ... The supreme God is one.

Hinduism is not as strictly monotheistic as Islam, but the
central concept of the unity of God is common to both. To
quote Dr. Radhakrishnan:

>The Real is the supercosmic,
eternal, spaceless, timeless Brahman who supports this cosmic
manifestation in space and time. He is the Universal Spirit,
Paramatman who ensoles the cosmic forms and movements.
He is the Paramesvara who presides over the individual souls
and movements of nature and controls the cosmic becoming.
He is also the Purusottama, the Supreme Person, whose dual
nature is manifested in the evolution of the cosmos. He fills
our being, illumines our understanding and sets in motion its
hidden springs.[^/008003]

[^/008003]:	Radhakrishnan, S., _The Bhagavadgita_, Bombay, 1948, p. 27.

This compares most favourably with what
the Quran says in surah al-Hashr, verses 23 and 24:

>He is God,
>
>There is none like Him
>
>He is the sovereign, the Holy,
>
>The One and Only.
>
>He is the Embodiment of Perfection,
>
>The Source of Peace,
>
>The Preserver of Safety,
>
>Exalted in Might;
>
>The Compeller, the Sublime,
>
>Glory be to Him.
>
>He is above all partners,
>
>He is the Creator, the Evolver,
>
>The Possessor of most beautiful names;
>
>All that is in the heavens and on the earth.
>
>Sing His praises
>
>And magnify His glory,
>
>He is the Most-Powerful
>
>And the All-Wise.

Nevertheless, there developed a strong pantheistic trend
in Hinduism because of the multiplicity of gods and goddesses.
After the Vedic period it was further strengthened, perhaps
because of the non-Aryan influence, but even this trend could
not dilute the unity of God. There is a world of difference in
the nature of idol-worship as practised in seventh-century
Arabia, as mentioned in the Quran, and the idol-worshippers
of India, who continued to recognize in one form or the other,
the oneness of the Supreme Being. Pantheism has, no doubt,
corrupted this faith among many sections of Hindus; the
confusion is of their own violation but many Hindus blame
Muslims for it. And thus the rage of the communal Hindus
descends on the Muslims.

The Prophet did not, in fact, deliberately destroy idols,
either during his 13 years of prophethood in Mecca or his 10year
rule over Medina. After his victorious entry into Kaaba
in AD 630, he removed the 360 idols placed therein by the
pagan Arabs, in defiance of the teachings of their ancestor,
Prophet Abraham, but this was no act of vandalism. As all the
Arabs had embraced Islam, the placement of the idols in the
Kaaba had become superfluous. Tabari (839--923), the Arab
historian of those times, vouchsafed that there was no
destruction of idols.

In surah al-Anam, verse 108, the Quran has also
admonished the faithful:

>Do not revile those who
>
>Worship other gods
>
>Lest in their ignorance
>
>They revile your God.
>
>Each people adhere to
>
>Their beliefs,
>
>They act as they please.
>
>But in the end
>
>All shall return to their Lord
>
>And will be told of the
>
>Wrongs they did.

Hindus eulogize the achievements of men like Raja Ram
Mohan Roy (1772--1833) and Maharshi Dayanand Saraswati
(1824--83); but they were both virulent opponents of idolworship;
the Maharshi, in particular, publicly destroyed them.

Hinduism is a vast ocean of beliefs in which innumerable
weeds have grown over the centuries; but its central plank
remains monotheistic. That is why Allama Iqbal in his
introduction to the Gayatri Mantra said that "to associate the
Hindu religion with shirk (associating partners to God) is, in
my opinion, not correct". For instance, Qutaiba, the Muslim
general who conquered Samarkand in the eighth century and
took away all its idols of gold and had them melted, did so
because he was in dire need of money; he did not do it to fulfil
any Islamic obligation. History is replete with such examples.

More than the destruction of idols, what is held against Islam,
particularly by communal Hindus, is the contention that Islam
sanctions the demolition of temples; in support of it they refer to
the misdeeds of some Muslim rulers in the medieval times; as
explained earlier this was in clear violation of the Quranic
injunctions. In surah al-Hajj, verse 40, the faithful are told:

>Had God not checked
>
>One set of people
>
>From interfering in the
>
>Affairs of another,
>
>Monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques,
>
>In which God's name is commemorated
>
>Would surely have been pulled down.

There are several verses which unequivocally prohibit
Muslims from resorting to such wanton act; in surah al-Baqara,
verse 114 states:

>Think over O people!
>
>Who commits a greater wrong
>
>Than one who hinders prayers
>
>And tries to ruin, in his zeal,
>
>The places of worship of others;
>
>It is not fitting that
>
>Such people should enter these
>
>Unless they have the fear of God,
>
>Otherwise they will face nothing but disgrace;
>
>In this as well as the next world.

In surah al-Anam, verse 52, the faithful are warned:

>Drive not away those
>
>Who worship their Lord,
>
>Morning and evening,
>
>Seeking His Grace.
>
>In no way are you accountable
>
>For what they do,
>
>Nor are they accountable
>
>For what you do.
>
>Hence do not drive them away
>
>And become evil-doers.

In surah Yunus, verse 99, the Prophet was told by Allah
how to go about his mission:

>Had your Lord so wished,
>
>All people everywhere
>
>Would have been believers.
>
>But that is not His way,
>
>Hence do not force anyone
>
>To take to Our path
>
>Unless they do so willingly.

The Prophet was also informed in surah al-Hajj, verse 167:

>For every group We have
>
>Prescribed rites and ceremonies
>
>Let them not then dispute.
>
>On these matters with you.

In the same surah, in verses 168 and 169 the Prophet was
told that inter-religious disputes were best left to God to be settled:

>In case they argue with you, O Muhammad!
>
>Tell them: "God knows best, what you do.
>
>God will judge between you and us
>
>On the Day of Judgement
>
>In regard to all matters of dispute."

There is no recorded evidence of the Prophet ever having
destroyed a temple, church or synagogue; on the contrary when
the Christian delegation of Najran came to see him at Medina,
he offered them his residence for their prayers. There is also
the Quranic verse 6 in surah al-Tauba, which mentions the
adoption of a tolerant attitude towards idol-worshippers:

>And if any one of the Pagans, O Muhammad!
>
>Seeks your asylum
>
>Then give it to him
>
>And later convey him
>
>To his place of safety.

Muslim rulers who destroyed temples, were new converts
to Islam, with no proper grounding in its precepts. Maulana
Sayyid Sulaiman Nadwi in his book, Arab O' Hindu ke
Ta'alluqat, has said:

>The Turks, Afghans and Mughals who
successively conquered northern India certainly professed
Islam but it is wrong to hold Islam responsible for all their
actions, good or bad. The tribal hordes, who poured through
the Khyber Pass, though nominally Muslim, did not, in fact,
represent Islam.[^/008004]

They were mostly emancipated slaves, newly
converted, who had practically no knowledge of the Quranic
teachings or the traditions of the Prophet. In Afghanistan,
from where they poured into India, they did not have a single
school of Muslim theology or learning. Hence, as Nadwi said,

>... there is no justification for believing that the conduct of
the Afghan tribes in peace or war was regulated by Islam.[^/008005]

The same applies to the hordes of Central Asia who founded
the Mughal empire.

[^/008004]:	Nadwi, Sayyid Sulaiman, _Arab O' Hindu ke Ta'alluqat_, Hyderabad, 1962, p. 103.

[^/008005]:	_Ibid_., p. 104.

This has also been confirmed by Bernard Lewis; he
observed:

>the Mongol impact created a ruling elite of men
who bear Muslim names and profess Islam, but who impose
and administer non-Muslim laws ... In the fourteen centuries
of Islamic history, few Muslim governments have adhered
strictly to the Shariah. But where they failed it, was by error or
avoidance, not by direct challenge ... in the modernized
Muslim states of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,
Shariah law was not merely neglected or tacitly disregarded; it
was, in certain important areas, repealed and replaced ...[^/008006]

[^/008006]:	Akbar, M.J., _The Shade of Swords --- _Jihad_ and the Conflict Between Islam and Christianity_, New Delhi, 2002, pp. 68--69.

The communal Hindus also allege that Islam teaches
Muslims to disrespect the religious leaders and mentors of other
religions, especially of Hinduism. This is also far from true;
they may not be as reverential towards, for instance, Rama
and Krishna as their own prophet. But even during the Muslim
rule the rulers as well as the elite and the ordinary folks gave
all the respect to the religious dignitaries of the Hindus. In fact
the Quran enjoins upon the faithful not to revile other religions
and make no distinction between the various prophets.

Several theologians, in medieval times, notably Hazrat
Mirza Mazhar Jan-i-Janan, declared that Rama and Krishna
were the prophets of God; it stands to reason that a vast
subcontinent, inhabited by millions of God's creatures, could
not have been deprived of His messengers, when the Quran
specifically states that "to every people We have sent an
apostle" and further, to teach them "in their own language."
Maulana Sayyid Sulaiman Nadwi, in his monumental work,
Seeratun Nabi, observed:

>According to the teachings of the
Prophet, it is necessary to believe that in countries such as
China, Iran or India there appeared prophets before the advent
of Muhammad. No Muslim can really deny to the peoples in
these lands, the truth of the faiths, ascribed to the mentors
venerated by them.

Similarly Mirza Abul Fazl in his wellknown
book Faith of Islam asserts:

>All the Vedic rishis of old
and Krishna, Mahavira and Buddha of India, Zarathustra of
Persia and Confucius of China have alike a place in the hearts
of the followers of Islam.

There is also the Quranic reference
to the community of Sabaeen, which, no less a theologian
than Shah Waliullah states, referred to Hindus of Aryan origin.
Nadwi also bracketed them with Jews and Christians and wrote
that they could be considered as "People of the Book". There
is also the saying of the Prophet that he received divine
fragrance from across the seas, pointing to India, Allama Iqbal
has versified it thus:

>Meer-i-Arab ko Aiyee Thandee Hawa Jahaanse
>
>Mera Watan wohi hai, Mera Watan wohi hai.
>
>From whence the chief of Arabia received divine fragrance,
>
>That is my country, that is my land.

Hazrat Ali, the fourth caliph and son-in-law of the Prophet
is reported to have said that the most invigorating breeze came
to Arabia from India. The Quran devotes more than onefourth
of its verses to narrate the stories of other prophets,
with a view to assure the Prophet that he need not be
disheartened by the opposition he faced; prophets before him
were similarly persecuted. In surah Ali-Imran, verse 146,
Muhammad is informed:

>How many of the prophets fought
>
>To uphold God's faith
>
>And carried with them
>
>Hordes of men of hope?
>
>However they never lost faith
>
>Even if they met with disaster,
>
>Nor did they weaken or give in
>
>For God loves those
>
>Who are firm in their resolve.

Further, there is a warning that the faithful should not make
any distinction between one prophet and another. In surah
al-Baqara, verse 285, God admonishes the believers:

>Among the apostles, make no distinction.
>
>For they have all proclaimed:
>
>That they heard the message
>
>And they obeyed it.
>
>They asked for the forgiveness of the One
>
>To whom is the journey's end.

There is, therefore, no truth in the allegation against Indian
Muslims that they show no reverence to Rama, Krishna or
other Hindu deities; in fact Iqbal has characterized Rama as
Imam-i-Hind, the spiritual leader of India, in a celebrated poem:

>The cup of India has always overflowed
>
>With the heady wine of truth.
>
>Even the philosophers from the West
>
>Are her ardent devotees.
>
>There is something so sublime in her mysticism
>
>That her star soars high above the constellations.
>
>There have been thousands of rulers in this land
>
>But none that can compare with Rama.
>
>The discerning ones proclaim him,
>
>The spiritual leader of India.
>
>His lamp gave the light of wisdoni
>
>Which outshone the radiance
>
>Of the whole of humankind.
>
>Rama was valiant, Rama was bold,
>
>Rama yielded deftly his sword,
>
>He cared for the poorest of poor,
>
>He was unmatched in love and compassion.

Urdu literature is flooded with eulogies to Sri Krishna; his
character and philosophy of action is profusely acclaimed. In
every age some of the most eminent Muslims from Iqbal to
Sahir Ludhianavi wrote and sang his praises. For instance
Maulana Hasrat Mohani, one of the most renowned Urdu
poets, wrote:

>Every note of Krishna's flute,
> 
>Is, indeed, a message of eternal life.

Similarly, another great poet, Seemab Akbarabadi sang:

>With his refreshing and soothing flute,
>
>Krishna sings his songs of love,
>
>Sometimes he does it
>
>In the vein of a Prophet,
>
>Arol sometimes as a wandering milkman,
>
>Promoting love in human hearts;
>
>He made the land of India
>
>Reverberate with his melodies
>
>As composed in the Gita.

Sahir Ludhanaw, the noted lyricist, is ecstatic about
Kunne in the following poem, as translated into the English.

>Krishna has promised,
>
>That he will come back
>
>Whenever the earth is menaced
>
>By injustice and oppression
>
>And when chaos and anarchy
>
>Threaten to pervade it
>
>Krishna comes to us;
>
>When everything become, hostile and critical
>
>He arrives to help the aggrieved
>
>And rescue the oppressed.
>
>Krishna is not a sect or a creed
>
>Nor is he a being;
>
>He is the embodiment
>

The greatest Urdu poet of all times, Mirza Asadullah Khan
Ghalib (1797--1869), wrote a long poem in Persian on the
majesty of Benaras or Kashi which is the most soul-stirring
tribute that any poet has ever paid in any language to Benaras.

It is entitled Charagh-i-Dair (temple lamps) and has been
beautifully translated into the English by the great Urdu
novelist, the Jnanpith award-winner, Qurratulain Hyder:

>May Heaven keep
>
>The grandeur of Benaras, arbour of bliss, meadow of joy,
>
>For oft-returning souls
>
>Their journey's end.
>
>In this weary Temple-land of the world.
>
>Safe from the whirlwind of Time,
>
>Benaras is forever spring,
>
>Where autumn turns
>
>Into the touch of sandal
>
>On their foreheads,
>
>Springtide wears the sacred thread of flower-waves,
>
>And the splash of twilight
>
>Is the crimson mark of Kashi's dust
>
>On heaven's brow.
>
>The Kaaba of Hind, this conch-blowers' dell!
>
>Its icons and idols
>
>Are made of the Light
>
>That once flashed on Mount Sinai.
>
>These radiant, idolatrous naiads
>
>Set the pious Brahmins afire
>
>When their faces glow
>
>Like moving lamps
>
>On Ganga's banks.
>
>Morning and moonrise,
>
>My Lady Kashi
>
>Picks up the Ganga-mirror
>
>To see her gracious beauty
>
>Glimmer and shine.
>
>Said I one night to a pristine seer
>
>(Who knew the secrets of whirling Time),
>
>'Sir, you well perceive,
>
>That goodness and faith,
>
>Fidelity and love
>
>Have all departed from the sorry land.
>
>Father and son are at each other's throat;
>
>Brother fights brother. Unity
>
>And Federation are undermined.
>
>Despite these ominous signs
>
>Why has not Doomsday come?
>
>Why does not the Last Trumpet sound?
>
>Who holds the reins of the Final Catastrophe?
>
>The hoary old man of lucent ken
>
>Pointed towards Kashi and gently smiled.
>
>'The Architect,' he said, 'is fond of this edifice
>
>Because of which there is colour in life; He
>
>Would not like it to perish and fall.'
>
>Hearing this, the pride of Benaras
>
>Soared to an eminence
>
>Untouched by the wings of thought.

There is no recorded evidence that ordinary Muslims ever
indulged in either the destruction of temples or idols; they
have, on the contrary, always shown due respect to the religious
sentiments of the Hindus. Urdu literature is replete with songs
glorifying Krishna and extolling the importance of Hindu epics
like Ramayana and Mahabharata. Even parts of the Vedas and
the Upanishads are translated and eulogized in Urdu. There is
much ignorance about this among Hindus; they are made to
believe that Muslims neither read the scriptures of the Hindus
nor revere them.
