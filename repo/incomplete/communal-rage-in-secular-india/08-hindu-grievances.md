# Hindu Grievances

What happened in Gujarat recently resulting in the
death and destruction of thousands of innocent and
helpless Indians has no doubt besmirched the fair name of India
and cast a shadow on our democratic and secular polity.
However I remain an optimist though not in the same measure
as before. Communal harmony has no doubt been damaged
beyond repair; our humanistic values are being torn to shreds.
Even so, the fact that India survived the horrors of Partition
and refused to become a Hindu rashtra, despite the relentless
provocation from Pakistan, keeps my hopes alive; a single
instance of genocide cannot destroy the basis of broad humanism
which has been the basis of our existence for thousands of years.
It has sustained our civilization through all the stresses and stains
of the times. The poet Iqbal rightly pointed out:

>Iran-o-Misr-o Ruma sab mit gaye jahaan-se
>
>Abtak magar hai baaqi, naamo-nishaan hamaara
>
>Kuch baat hai kay hasti mit-ti nahi hamaari
>
>Sadyon rahaa hai dushman daur-i-zamaan hamaara.
>
>\ 
>
>All the ancient civilizations of the past,
>
>They are dead, gone and no longer heard of;
>
>May it be Iran, Egypt, Greece or Rome.
>
>But despite the forces working against us,
>
>There is something indestructible in us
>
>Which refuses to let our existence be erased.

Max Mueller said it with a personal touch:

>If I were to ask
myself from what literature we here in Europe --- who have
been nurtured almost exclusively on the thoughts of the Greeks
and the Romans and of one Semitic race, the Jewish --- may
draw the corrective which is most wanted in order to make
our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive more universal,
in fact more truly human a life, not for this life alone but a
transfigured and eternal life, again I should point to India.[^/005001]

Likewise India can never be fascist as happened in
Germany, Italy or Spain; some instances may indeed create a
sense of dismay among us; but eventually our past itself will
safeguard both our present and our future. There are, no doubt,
certain signs pointing in the opposite direction, which we
cannot ignore. They pertain to the developments in the short
time since Partition and also to those which have a certain
historical and religious bearing in the long term.

For over fifty years now, I have been fearing the onslaught
of the communal Hindus on the Indian Muslims --- those who
stayed back in India; the hostilities between the two
communities were intensified by the British in order to
perpetuate their rule. The various measures they took in
pursuance of their divide and rule policy, are too well-known
to be repeated here. But more than any other leader it was
Jinnah with his pernicious Two-Nation theory who did the
greatest harm to Hindu--Muslim relations. The writings of V.D.
Savarkar, Lala Lajpat Rai and the leaders of the Hindu
Mahasabha were no less divisive but their impact was limited;
there was hardly any response to it from the Hindus. Gandhi
and Nehru had not only diluted their effect but generated a
more harmonious atmosphere. Jinnah spoilt it all as I have
elaborated in my book: The Man Who Divided India. In order
to achieve his ambition of carving out a separate homeland
for the Muslims, he used words that hurt and left a festering
sore on Hindu--Muslim relations. He went on stressing that
there was nothing in common between the two communities.

He said:

>Hindus and Muslims belong to two different
religious philosophies, social customs, and literature. They
neither intermarry, nor inter-dine together and indeed they
belong to two different civilizations which are based mainly
on conflicting ideas and conceptions. Their aspects on life
and of life are different. It is quite clear that Hindus and
Mussalmans drive their inspiration from different sources of
history. They have different epics, their heroes are different,
and they have different episodes. Very often the hero of one is
a foe of the other and likewise their victories and defeats
overlap.[^/005002]

[^/005002]:	Hasan, Mushirul, _India's Partition, Process, Strategy and Mobilization_, New Delhi, 1993, p. 178.

Jinnah thus harangued and went on to say that
Hindus worship the cow and Muslims eat it. This was the
unkindest cut. He succeeded only in damaging the relations
between the two communities to an irreparable extent and
got his Pakistan with the terrible aftermath that both Hindus
and Muslims had to suffer.

But while he was able, as he claimed, to free two-third of
the Muslims in undivided India from what he described as
Hindu domination, it was the one-third who had to bear the
brunt of his tirade of hate against the Hindus. Gandhi sacrificed
his life to preserve Hindu--Muslim unity. Nehru tried his best
as Prime Minister to protect Muslims from the rage of the
communal Hindus. He made secularism the basis of his
governance; his successors, including his daughter pursued it
to the extent she could. But the relations between Hindus
and Muslims had been so impaired due to the entire struggle
for Pakistan and its creation that not much was really achieved
in overcoming it. Riots went on recurring; one issue or another
was brought to the fore by one side or the other and that
caused further alienation between the two.

Politics played havoc; it pitted one community against the
other; Muslims failed to realize that despite the rights and
guarantees given to them in the Constitution, even democracy
worked on the basis of numbers. Hindus constituted 85%
of the population of divided India; Muslims, only 12; the rest
of the minorities, notably Christians and Sikhs, 3%.
Hindus would thus inevitably be the rulers; they were to be in
command of all the sinews of power. It was foolhardiness on
the part of Muslims, misguided by their leaders, to imagine
they could confront the Hindus and have their way. They
fought on non-issues and brought more and more misery to
the ordinary Muslims; every time they exhibited their bravado,
it generated a Hindu backlash. Instead of working out
compromises with the Hindus, they insisted on demanding
their rights which they were unable to obtain.

Some political parties, claiming to be secular, took up the
Muslim cause but they could do little to improve their lot.
They managed to get their votes but could not afford to
displease the Hindus who formed the major vote-bank.
Hindus could not get over their prejudices against Muslims;
these were endemic to their relationship. To quote Prof
Gyanendra Pandey:

>Once again, much that has lain dormant
for a while has surfaced with a vengeance. Recent outpourings
from the Hindu Right-wing work on the basis of a brazen
division of India into the civilized (Hindus) and the barbarian
(Muslims). The former are said to be educated, rational and
'modern' --- or potentially educable, rational, and 'modern'.
The latter are declared congenitally incapable of attaining
these conditions, and unwilling even to try. The civilized
are concerned about the problem of rapid population growth,
and attentive to the needs of hygiene, science and medicine.
The barbarians choose to live in ghettos, dirty, overcrowded,
and unventilated; they multiply like rabbits, and spread filth
and disease. For all these reasons, the pronouncement goes,
as well as on account of their innate religious bigotry and
aggressiveness, the Muslims are a source of grave danger to
society, 'modernity', 'civilization'.[^/005003]

I don't want to go into the politics of the revival of the
process of hate by the communal Hindus against the Muslims;
it has much to do with vote banks and power game. I am,
however, reproducing here the observations of one of the most
erudite proponents of Hinduism; Dr. R.S. Misra is the former
Professor of Comparative Religion at Benaras Hindu University.
He writes:

>In the name of secularism, the sovereign state has
imposed modern western culture on India in various ways and
has deprived the people of their cultural freedom ... The
Muslim religious leaders show their faith in secularism, dharmanirpekshata
only because it has given them special privileges
which are denied to the Hindus ... The special status given to
Kashmir under Article 370 has eventually resulted in making
the Hindus of that state refugees in their own county ...

Dr. Misra dilates further on his charge of appeasement of
Muslims:

>But things have gone too far now. Hinduism cannot
afford to keep itself under subjection to secularism or dharmanirpekshata
any longer ... The civil law of our secular State is
applicable to all the communities of the country excepting
the community of Muslims. How far the Muslim community
has been benefited by it is a different matter altogether. But it
has undoubtedly given immense satisfaction and pleasure to
Muslim religious leadership which is based on politics. The
sovereign state of India lost its real secular character the day it
retained the Muslim Personal law and failed to formulate a
common civil code of personal laws applicable to all the citizens
of the country in a uniform way. This arbitrary and unjust
application of secularism by the state has created an
impregnable barrier in the way of unity and national
integration ... [^/005004]

[^/005004]:	Misra, R.S., _Hinduism and Secularism --- A Critical Study_, Delhi, 1996, pp. 42--45.

Dr. Misra proceeds to give certain specific examples:

A new Hindu Code was enacted and introduced but the
Muslim Personal law was left untouched. The Smritis that had
governed the secular and religious life of the Hindus down the
ages were thrown overboard, but the Shariah that governed
the life of the Muslims in the same way was not set aside. It
was allowed to operate in the same way on the Muslim
community in the post-independence era as it had done till
then ... By retaining the Muslim Personal Law governed by
the Shariat, the secular state of India gave free scope and full
freedom to Muslim leadership and its religious organizations
to keep their iron grip on the Muslim population and hold
supreme authority over it as before. The state can exercise no
authority over the Muslims in this respect. The law of
monogamy is obligatory on all the people of India excepting
the community of Muslims. The Constitution of the secular
state of India has granted the Muslim community freedom to
enjoy the special privilege of polygamy under the Muslim
Personal Law ... it shows great concern and with full
justification for the freedom and emancipation of Hindu
women. But it sees no injustice in turning its back on the
Muslim women and keeping itself quite unconcerned with
their fate and welfare. It has set aside the judgements of the
courts, even of the Supreme Court on the issues concerning
the lot of Muslim women through legislation ... (thus) Muslim
religious organizations (have succeeded) by keeping intact and
even strengthening their fundamentalist character ... [^/005005]

[^/005005]:	_Ibid_., pp. 101--03.

Dr. Misra has voiced the reaction of most Hindus to the
opposition of the Muslims to the enactment of the Common
civil code. I agree with him that their agitation to it is both
misconceived and misplaced. But the issue is not as simple as
Dr. Sharma has made out; it is also politically motivated. True,
the enactment is a directive principle of the Constitution but
there are many other directives about which there has been
no such insistence. Muslim leaders, without realizing the
difficulties involved in enacting such a code, have played into
the hands of their opponents by articulating their opposition
to it. They have not bothered to study the history of the
unification of the Hindu Code Bill, which created the biggest
controversy among Hindus.

Prime Minister Nehru appointed two expert committees
to prepare a report reflecting the views of different schools
relating to succession, inheritance, marriage, divorce, adoption
and guardianship among Hindus and work out some kind of
consensus. On the basis of the recommendations of these
committees the then Law Minister, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar,
prepared a comprehensive bill, codifying all the Hindu laws
and moved it in the provisional Parliament in 1948; but right
from the start it faced stiff opposition. Even President Prasad
expressed his unhappiness at its enactment. Amendments after
amendments were moved and some members even resorted to
filibustering to frustrate its passage. It took days for even the
preliminary clauses to be passed. Nehru realized the futility of
going ahead and shelved the measure. Despite the fact that
the Congress was in an overwhelming majority, the Prime
Minister was unable to win over the MPs to his way of reformist
thinking. Many of them openly told him that to support it
would hurt their religious sensibilities. He gave up the idea
and did nothing until 1950, when on the advice of Dr
Ambedkar he decided to split the comprehensive Bill into
separate legislative measures and mollify the Opposition by
initiating reforms piecemeal.

The first piece of legislation brought before the provisional
Parliament was the Hindu Marriage and Divorce Bill. It did
not propose any revolutionary change in the existing law; it
only sought to streamline the provision for judicial separation
between couples. Still it had to be referred to a joint select
committee of the two Houses, which suggested some
amendments and was passed after a number of compromises
were agreed to by the government. This was followed by the
Hindu Succession Bill, which also got stalled due to a series of
objections from different quarters. The result was that the
provisions relating to mitakshara, the joint family, which
governed more than 80% of the Hindus, were dropped.
This deprived inheritance to women, as under it only men
were entitled to inherit ancestral property. Women could not
be allowed, as of right, even to live in the 'dwelling houses' of
their ancestors. This was far from the reforms Nehru had aimed
at. It struck at the root of women's emancipation. The Hindu
Adoption and Maintenance Bill did not create much
controversy and was passed without any difficulty; it enabled
women also to adopt male children and the adoption of female
children was made legal.

Such were the problems faced by the sponsors in the passage
of the Hindu Code Bill; it will be much more difficult to
incorporate and adjust all personal laws of different
communities under a common civil code. Once the process
begins, it will cause unprecedented religious upheaval not only
among religious minorities but also among large sections of
the majority Hindu community, which is divided and
subdivided into several castes and sub-castes, each with its
peculiar rites and customs, rules and regulations. Experience
also shows that laws do not reform societies. Child marriages
take place despite the Sharda Act and dowry persists despite
strict penal provisions. Both Hindus and Muslims are in need
of effective reforms in their Personal Laws; sincere legislative
effort must be made in that direction especially among the
Muslims. That will have to be the first step; then the question
of common civil code can be considered. Muslims should not
oppose something without knowing what it will be.

However the hope that a common civil code will bring
about all round uniformity among the citizens, disregarding
the Personal Laws of various communities and castes is wishful
thinking; before its enactment there will be many hurdles to
go through. The history of the opposition to the enactment of
Hindu code is a pointer. At the inauguration of the Deen Dayal
Institute in New Delhi on August 20, 1972, Guru Golwalker
expressed his strong reservation about it as can be seen from
his replies to questions put to him by a correspondent of
Motherland (now defunct), the one-time organ of the Jana
Sangh:

Q. Don't you consider a uniform civil code necessary for
the furtherance of national integration?

A. No, I don't think so. You and many others will be
surprised to hear it, but this is my opinion and I should express
the truth the way I see it ... It is not that I object to a uniform
civil code as such. But at the same time it must be borne in
mind that something cannot become desirable only because it
is mentioned in the Constitution.

Q. Don't you think that Muslims are opposing the uniform
civil code just to maintain their identity and individuality?

A. I have no grievance against any section, community
or fraternity desiring to maintain its identity or individuality,
provided that this 'identity' is not a hurdle in the way of
sentiments for patriotism ... So long as Muslims love this
country and its culture we welcome their way of life.

Q. Will it be right to permit Muslim women to remain in
purdah and put up with polygamy?

A. Muslims should be given an opportunity to give up
their archaic laws. If they themselves conclude that polygamy
is not good for them, I will be very happy. But I will not like to
impose my views on them.

The agitation mounted by the Muslims, at the behest of
some of their misguided leaders, against the judgement of the
Supreme Court in the Shah Bano case was not justified; the
methods used were most objectionable, which had caused a
lot of resentment among a large number of responsible citizens.
The language used against the judges, for instance, by Z.R.
Ansari, a minister in the government of Rajiv Gandhi was
most objectionable. The allegation by some of the Ulama that
the judgement violated the relevant provision of the Shariah
was also baseless; it was also wrong on Rajiv Gandhi's part to
have given in to pressure from these Muslims and have the
Constitution amended and a new law enacted to undo the
alleged wrong; it claimed to provide better maintenance to
divorced Muslim women but in practice it did exactly the
opposite; it has made divorce much easier for men because
maintenance for divorced wives was reduced; hundreds of
young Muslim women, divorced in consequence of the new
law, have been thrown on the streets. Wakf Boards were to
look after them; but none came forward. Moosa Raza, a retired
top bureaucrat, has pointed out in his article in _The Indian
Express_ that the new law had been thrown out by the Supreme
Court. Criticizing in bitter terms the agitation on the Shah
Banoo case, Javed Iqbal, the son of Allama Iqbal and the former
Chief Justice of Pakistan has remarked:

>To fight a legal battle
on a legal issue outside the court and that too in a foolish
manner gives the impression to others that Muslims have no
regard for the sanctity of the Court's decision. This is unwise.
It amounts to Muslims committing political and calculated
suicide.

The worst part of this unfortunate episode was the
Hindu reaction against the Muslims; they were furious that
even now Muslims could get the Constitution amended for a
wrong objective. Historians are agreed that this was the major
cause, which provoked the Rath Yatra, and gave rise to the
Ramjanmabhoomi movement which culminated in the
demolition of the Babri Masjid.

Prof. Sharma has put the case against Muslims and their
appeasement soberly and without much rancour; but that is
not the case as far as the advocates of Hindu rashtra are
concerned. They have denounced them with no holds barred
and demanded the establishment of Hindu rashtra as a counter
to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan; they want that Muslims
should be shown their proper place in India. This has been
put eloquently by Prof. Gyanendra Pandey in the book Hindus
and Others which he has so ably edited. In his introduction to
it he mentions how Hindu communalists consider "every
Muslim as fanatical, licentious and aggressive".

Prof. Pandey comments:

>It is a faithful echo of a line
strongly plied by British and French imperialism in the late-nineteenth
century, and by their American successor in the
late twentieth. Every Muslim in India is, moreover, a foreigner
(Babur ki aulad, the 'progeny of Babur' is the collective
designation most commonly employed, in utter disregard of
the parallel argument --- also often made by Hindu propagandists
--- that the majority of Muslims in the subcontinent came from
the lowest castes and classes, ignorant and innocent, who were
forcibly converted to Islam). All Indian Muslims become
'foreigners' and of course, 'trouble-makers'.

Hindu
communalists, according to the professor, make no bones about
their objective; they insist that "once Pakistan has been
established, why should Muslims stay on here?" They contend
'All Muslims are at heart Pakistanis: Why else do they support
Pakistan in cricket?' Furthermore, "all Muslims are aggressive;
they manufacture bombs and accumulate arms. If you examine
the matter (you will find that) every riot is started by them."

"The politics of Hindu self-assertion," writes Prof. Pandey,
"has reached a new militant pitch over the last few years; it
speaks in the name of Hindu rights and Hindu nationalism.
On Ayodhya, for example, they argue:

>If we cannot build a
temple in our own country, at the birthplace of our most
popular deity, where can we build? And if we cannot build
even a temple in our own land, in what sense are we free?
This pseudo-secular Raj is worse than the British Raj (in the
treatment that it metes out to Hindus)...
 
They have coined a variety of new slogans: 'Garva se kaho ham Hindu hain'
(Declare with pride that we are Hindus); 'Hindu jaaga, desh
jaagega' (With the Hindu awakening, the nation awakes). And
further: 'The Hindus have been tolerant for far too long; they
are still too timid.' Or, alternatively: 'The need of the hour is
not tolerance but courage.' These slogans derive a great deal
of their force from the simultaneous appeal to nationalism and
to Ram bhakti. To these persons a Muslim is an enemy, who
has to be fought and banished. Prof. Pandey explains its
repercussions:

>The message of 'nationalism' and the message
>of 'religion' has assumed a particularly blood-curdling form in
>the propaganda generated in Ayodhya in the 1980s and early
>90s. One of the panels in the VHP showroom adjacent to the
>Babri Masjid, for instance, described the task of a Hindu youth
>now and in the future, in the following terms:
>
>Kahin na phir ham se chhin jaaye,
>
>Ramjanmabhoomi hamaari.
>
>Uttho, chunauti ko sweekaro ---
>
>Yuvakon aaj hamaari baari.
>
>Mitado vishva se in dushton ko,
>
>Banen \[bano\] jagat ke vishva vijeta
>
>\ 
>
>Beware, lest our Ramjanmabhoomi
>
>Is once again seized from us.
>
>Arise! Accept the challenge
>
>Young men! It is our turn today.
>
>Wipe out these tyrants from the world
>
>And become world-conquerors ...

Likewise an audio-cassette sold in Ayodhya, and all over
northern India blares out the following poisonous message:

>Bharat mein Babur bahut hain ---
>
>Unko khatm karne ka intezaam kar deejiye.
>
>Basne na paayen Ram-drohiyon ki bastiyaan ---
>
>Aisi bastiyon ko shamshaan kar deejiye.
>
>\ 
>
>There are too many Baburs in India ---
>
>Arrange to wipe them out.
>
>We want no habitations of the enemies of Ram ---
>
>Turn all such habitations
>
>into burning --- ghats, crematoria ...

"Today the (primary) issue is not the building of the
temple," declared the eighty-year-old 'sadhu', Mahant
Paramhans Ramchandra Das, one of the central figures in the
Ramjanmabhoomi 'liberation' movement. "they have taken
1,500 of my children. I want 15,000 in return. The question
of building the temple will be taken up then." Not 15,000
policemen or officials or politicians: 15,000 Muslim 'children',
in return for 1,500 of 'our own'...

>The protagonists of Hindutva are determined that
'barbarians' must be 'civilized'. In India as elsewhere, the
'dreaded' Muslim must be 'disarmed' by disenfranchisement,
deculturization, or any other means to hand. At the very least,
'the Muslims', if they are to stay on in India, must become
'Indian' in dress and manner: adopt 'our' names, 'our' language,
'our' clothes, 'our' food habits (why not 'our' religion too?).
In a word, if they wish to live in India, they must learn to live
like 'us'. 'Hindustan mein rahna hai to hamse milkar rahna hoga'
(If you wish to live in Hindustan, you will have to learn to live
like us.) 'Hindustan mein rahna hai to Bande-Mataram kahna
hoga'. If you wish to live in Hindustan, you will have to raise
the slogan, Bande Mataram (Victory to the Mother). 'Live like
us' or face annihilation: 'Babur ki santaan --- jaao Pakistan ya
Qabrastan' Children of Babur! Go to Pakistan or the grave,
a slogan that appears to have been taken literally by large
sections of the police and the local Hindu population in several
places in India.[^/005006]

Babur has been unjustly maligned for the alleged
destruction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and the
construction in its place of a mosque which has been wrongly
described as Babri Masjid. The emperor had nothing to do
with either of the two operations. There is no mention of
such an important fact in his memoirs; nor is such an act of
destruction in consonance with the will that he had left for
his son and successor Humayun, in which he had specifically
advised him that he should not "damage the places of worship
and temples which fall within the boundaries of our rule."

The mosque was built by one of his generals, Mir Baqi
who was a Shia; Babur was a Sunni. Mir Baqi had built it for
the exclusive use of Shias; Sunnis, as a rule, don't pray in Shia
mosques and vice versa. When a controversy about the
Ramjanmabhoomi was raised in 1988, the General Secretary
of the All-India Shia Conference affirmed in a press statement
that it was a Shia mosque and the Shias had no objection to
its relocation in a nearby village which was the birth place of
Mir Baqi. They also got a fatwa issued by the Shaikhul Imam
of Najaf, the highest religious authority of the Shias, to the same
effect. But as the Sunnis had meanwhile taken over the mosque
and named it Babri Masjid, the matter assumed a different
connotation. The rest is history. To call the Indian Muslims
Babur ki Aulad is, indeed, absurd; neither the emperor would
have ever owned it nor will Indian Muslims ever accept it.
