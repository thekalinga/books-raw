# What Should Muslims Do?

How should Indian Muslims cope with the rising rage
of communal Hindus? There is great deal of anxiety
among them. Many of them have come to believe there is
little they can do to save themselves.

Hindus are 85% and Muslims only 12. Hindus have
all the sinews of power --- the government, the army, the police,
the public and the private sectors; all are ranged against them.
So far the villages were immune to the communal virus; but
now they are also contaminated by it. How can a minority
face such a formidable combination?

Out of sheer frustration, Prof. Fuzail Jafferey quoted
Ghalib's couplet in his editorial in Inquilab, one of the most
widely read Urdu newspapers:

>Koyee ummeed bar nahee aatee
>
>Koyee surat nazar nahee aatee
>
>No hope seems to be fulfilled
>
>No solution appears on the horizon.

Many years before the genocide of Muslims in Gujarat, I
wrote in my book The Widening Divide, published by Penguin:

>For the first time Muslims are unable to react; they have neither
the capacity nor the will. They are despondent and depressed;
they are uncertain of the future. As facts and figures have
disclosed, they are so down and out that nothing stirs them.
They seem to be resigned to their lot. Hindus feel no sympathy
for them; on the contrary they will be happy to be rid of these
'troublesome creatures.' India, they think, will be much better
off without them. There is no desire on either side to forget
the past and be friends; it has been attempted before and what
was the result, both ask. Hindus are swept along by the rising
tide of Hindutva; they are not willing to make any adjustments
with the Muslims.

Though relations between the two communities have
worsened since then as a result of the systematic indoctrination
of hate carried out by certain sections of the communal Hindus
against Muslims, I hope the madness that gripped the militant
Hindus in Gujarat will not be repeated; even the firebrand
sanyasin Uma Bharati has spoken strongly against it. She said:

>The rise of intolerance among the Hindu youth and the fact
that they are unapologetic about such inhuman acts is a cause
for great concern. That such elements --- even if small in number
--- exist among Hindus is terrible. They must be destroyed from
the roots.[^/0011001]

[^/0011001]:	_The Times of India_, May 29, 2002.

There are in fact many Hindus who are deeply
upset at the gruesome happenings in Gujarat and are
determined to save India from such communal scourge; they
are more alert now than ever before. They remain determined
and undaunted to protect India's multi-religious pluralism. They
include leaders of secular parties, intellectuals of all hues and
mediapersons --- reporters, photographers, cameramen,
commentators, editors and proprietors of leading English and
language newspapers; the electronic media, in particular, played
a heroic role indeed. All of them exhibited rare courage in
hostile conditions, providing a ray of hope for the future; they
were hell-bent to ensure that the legacy of broad humanism
which is the kernel of Hinduism, should not be destroyed.
They seem however to be in a minority; the communal Hindus
are on the rise.

In this situation, what should Indian Muslims do?
Confrontation has only worsened relations; it has done no
good to the Muslims. The only alternative, after 55 years of
bitter experience is for them to change their entire outlook in
tackling issues which are plaguing both communities. Emphasis
on differences must go. Muslims must try and become an
integral part of the mainstream. This does not mean their
identity needs to be submerged or compromised but they must
wholeheartedly collaborate in enriching composite nationalism
which continues to be our pride. For this, they must get out of
their ghetto mentality, break the barriers of alienation and
generate a harmonious environment.

They should do some introspection and ask whether they
have genuinely tried to contribute to the strengthening of
Hindu--Muslim relations since Partition. The answer will be,
no. I am afraid their so-called leaders took them on the wrong
path. Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817--98) was much distressed
after the revolt of 1857 when the British had targeted the
Muslims with a vengeance. He advised them, in the teeth of
opposition from the elite and the religious leaders, to befriend
the British and advocated more social contact with them. He
even wrote a pamphlet on how Muslims should dine with
Christians. He urged Muslims to take to English education so
that the bridge between them and the rulers could be narrowed;
that would facilitate them in dealing with the ruling class. He
discouraged them from getting involved in agitational activities;
he opposed their joining the newly formed Indian National
Congress on the ground that the suspicion of the British against
them might be revived. His efforts paid rich dividends.

I feel the time has now come when Muslims will have to
once again adopt the same course of action. The situation
then and now may not be the same but there is much wisdom
in what the great Sayyid said and did in order to take Muslims
out of the slough of despondency and put them on the road to
recovery. The same needs to be done now. Let us first examine
what are the things that have spoilt Hindu--Muslim relations.
There is first the historical baggage that Muslims have to carry
but they can do little about it except make it clear that they
should not be victimized for whatever some Muslim rulers did
in the past. Then there are the religious misconceptions which
have been so widely spread against Muslims that they need
to be properly explained and removed; lastly there are the
issues which their leaders are fond of raising but which have
nothing to do with the day to day life of Muslims; they have
provided them with no relief; on the contrary these have done
them more harm and in fact provoked a severe backlash.

But when emotions are surcharged and wounds are raw,
to make suggestions which may not be palatable, can cause
resentment. The ire may even invite the charge of betrayal or
a "sell out". That is what exactly happened to Sir Sayyid; his
opponents went to Mecca and obtained a fatwa against him
from the Grand _Mufti_, declaring that the Sayyid deserved to
be killed because he had worked against Muslims, violating
the tenets of Islam. He was, however, a courageous man who
neither faltered nor failed; such attacks did not deter him from
going ahead. There is unfortunately no such leader in our
midst today; but even without such a leader an awareness has
to be created in the community that his example needs to be
followed if the present generation has to be rescued from the
plight which is worse than what Muslims faced during the
time of the Sayyid.

The most worrisome factor, which vitiates intercommunal
relations, is the recurrence of Hindu--Muslim riots; statistics
prove that there have been more riots in Free India than in
the hundred and fifty years of the British raj. And these have
been far more virulent too. Earlier both communities suffered
equally, now most of the victims are Muslims. Apart from the
death and destruction that are caused, riots paralyse the entire
community. They are completely uprooted and though
rehabilitation is promised no government --- regardless of the
party to which it belongs --- has ever done anything to really
uplift them. This has been confirmed by the eminent jurist,
V.R. Krishna Iyer, a retired judge of the Supreme Court of India
who said:

>In all major communal riots, the members of the
minority community have been invariably the worst sufferers
and they get no justice.[^/0011002]

[^/0011002]:	Ansari, Iqbal M., _Communal Riots_, p. 25.

Moreover the authorities and the police have never given
them the necessary security. Every government has put away
the recommendations of every commission of enquiry to rust
on the shelf. Should not the Muslims now take a realistic view
and think how best they can help build bridges with the Hindus
and forget to rely on either the Government or the commissions
and courts who have failed to provide them protection or
succour? The only safeguard for Muslims today seems to be
the creation of a congenial and harmonious atmosphere which
may prevent the recurrence of riots.

After the terrible carnage in Gujarat, Indian Muslims must
open their eyes to the ground reality that an increasing number
of Hindus have begun to hate them. There may be other
reasons for it also. The politics of the struggle for Partition, the
propagation of the Two-Nation theory by Jinnah and the
increasingly hostile role of Pakistan against India. As I have
explained in my latest book: The Man Who Divided India,
instead of freeing Muslims from Hindu domination as Jinnah
had claimed, he has, to use his words, put them permanently
under Hindu domination. The mess he created has been
so vicious that Muslims in divided India have been unable
to get out of it.

They went through the most heart-rending agony soon
after Partition. Harassed and humiliated they rushed to
Maulana Azad whom they had discarded during the movement
for Pakistan and begged of him to rescue them from their plight.
Azad told them in words which are as relevant today as they
were when he spoke to them:

>Do you remember I hailed you,
you cut off my tongue. I picked up my pen, you severed my
hand. I wanted to move forward, you cut off my legs. I tried to
turn over, and you injured my back ... I called upon you to
wake you up at every danger signal. You did not heed my call ...
I warned you that the Two-Nation theory was a death-knell to
a meaningful, dignified life; forsake it. I told you that the pillars
which you were leaning would inevitably crumble. To all
this you turned a deaf ear ... Time sped along. And now you
have discovered that the so-called anchors of your faith have
set you adrift, to be kicked around by fate ... [^/0011003]

[^/0011003]:	Azad, Abul Kalam, _India's Maulana_, Centenary Edition, Vol. 2, New Delhi, 1990, pp. 170--173.

As years passed their condition further deteriorated; they
lost their political clout and slipped into unprecedented
backwardness both educationally and economically.

But unfortunately their self-serving leaders, with utter
disregard to the aftermath of Partition, remained oblivious to
their miserable decline and continued to behave with
incredible arrogance, exhibiting a sense of false bravado by
their loud utterances; they take out protest marches at the
slightest pretext, hold demonstrations, shout slogans, demand
justice and fair play but all this never gives any relief to the
community. They put up one fight after another with the
authorities on irrelevant issues which often provoke more
hostility than goodwill. They fail to understand that by voicing
meaningless grievances, asking for unrealistic rights, wailing,
fretting and fuming, the leaders may gain some publicity but
the community loses a great deal. They quote the constitution
and demand the implementation of this provision or that,
guaranteed to the minorities but none of it gives Muslims the
required protection; even democracy is ranged heavily against
them because under it numbers count.

There is the glaring instance of Urdu; since it is spoken
largely by Muslims, it has been victimized and Muslims have
been unable to do anything about it. Memorandums and
petitions signed by lakhs of them were presented to the
Government for the protection of the language. To win the
votes of Muslims, occasional promises were made by several
leading political parties. The Gujral Committee was
constituted to look into the grievances. The Committee's report
created a lot of hype but it has proved to be just an eyewash. It
was tossed and turned around by every government but nothing
worthwhile came of it. Even when Inder Kumar Gujral, the
celebrated author of the report, became Prime Minister, none
of its recommendations were implemented. The tragedy is that
Indian Muslims get pleased and excited with mere gestures;
they don't realize that what matters, in any situation, is the
result. Similarly the Urdu academies, floated by State
governments might have financially helped a few budding
poets and authors, but, by and large, they have been ineffective
in preventing the steady decline of Urdu; the same is true of
the Minorities Commissions; none of them have been able to
redress the grievances of Muslims. All these measures have
been merely gimmicks to appease Muslims, rather than
provide them any substantial protection, assistance or relief.
An in-depth review of all these much-propagated institutions
will bare the truth.

Muslims are reduced to barely 12% now. Before
Partition, they were 33% and Hindus were less than
70%. In British India, in five out of eleven provinces
they had their own governments and even at the Centre, being
one-third of the total population, they occupied a decisive
position. Thanks to Jinnah, all that is lost. Indian Muslims
must therefore take stock of these facts and find out whether
the course their leaders have so far adopted even after Partition
has been right. Has it done them any good? If not, should
such leaders be allowed to continue functioning on the same
lines or should they be made to change their way and chart
out another, not only to save Muslims from the depressed state
in which they find themselves but also to help them readjust
to the pressures of the times so that they too could share the
benefits that the country has to offer.

Besides, have these leaders and their hold on different
sections of Muslims ever been tested? Have their credentials
been verified? They revel in defiance but defiance, without
the strength to succeed, is self-destructive. The Quran glorifies
the use of hikmat or wisdom; it prohibits confrontation, except
in self-defence. The Prophet always preached tolerance; he
worked for collaboration even with his antagonists. Have these
leaders ever followed him in this regard? Have they ever paused
to ascertain the ill-effects of their behaviour on Muslims as a
whole? Their uncompromising and rigid attitude on every
occasion has only weakened Hindu--Muslim relations further.

I wonder if I am right in attacking the venerable leaders.
I am reminded of a couplet by Javed Akhtar:

>Main jaanta hoon ke khamoshi main hee maslehat hai
>
>Magar yeh maslehat meiray dil ko khal rahee hai
>
>\ 
>
>All virtue comes from silence, so I'm told
>
>But that great virtue makes my blood run cold

The poet admits that it is not easy to bare the truth;
it needs a lot of courage:

>Jaane yeh kaisa daur hay jismein ye jurrat bhi mushkil hai
>
>Din ho agar tau usko likhoon din, raat agar ho,raat likhoon
>
>\ 
>
>In this age why is it so difficult to say what is right
>
>Can't I declare that day is day, and night is night?

I am reminded of a poem by Deputy Nazir Ahmed, the
great litterateur; it was addressed to Muslims when they were
mired in more or less a similar situation:

>Kuch na poocho aaj hum lecture may kya kehne ko hain
>
>Quom ko khud quom kay munh pur bura kehne ko hain
>
>Muddaton hum ne unko chupkay chupkay samjhaya kiya
>
>Ab jo kuch kehno ke hain, so barmala kehne ko hain.
>
>\ 
>
>Do not ask, what I will say in my discourse today,
>
>I shall reproach the community on its face;
>
>For years, we have been quietly making them understand
>
>But now, whatever is to be said, must be said with forthrightly.

Indian Muslims must now see the light of day and move in
a different direction which will take them forward and not
backward. They must discard their worn-out prejudices and
outmoded habits and adjust themselves to the requirements of
the changing times. They must harness their inner strength
and learn to be self reliant. They must give up asking for doles
which will only cripple them. In order to survive, they must
learn to stand on their own feet. For the fact is it that they
have no true friends; many of those who show them sympathy
or consideration are not sincere. They do so only to obtain
some electoral gain. This has been proved time and time again
but only the wise take the hint and correct themselves.

Muslims rely on India's commitment to secularism but it
has not proved to be of much help. Nor have Muslims of other
countries ever come to their rescue. The well-known columnist
Thomas L. Friendman has asked a pertinent question:

>Why
is it that when Hindus kill hundreds of Muslims it elicits an
emotionally muted headline in the Arab media but when Israel
kills a dozen Muslims, in a war in which Muslims are also killing
Jews, it inflames the entire Muslim world?

Then there are
the religious extremists, patronized mostly by Pakistan who
spread terror everywhere and bring shame and disgrace to their
co-religionists. Their gruesome actions further alienate
Muslims from non-Muslims. They pull Muslims out of the
confines of modern life with the result they are shunted out
from everywhere. Furthermore the suicidal rage of these
fanatics, as a critic has said, is dragging down one of the finest
civilizations that the human race ever witnessed. President
Musharraf has himself realized now that these _jihadis_ are
causing havoc everywhere including in Pakistan. Even so they
are still supported and financed by a number of leading
Pakistani religious groups who encourage them to secretly
infiltrate into India and commit murderous operations mostly
against innocent Hindus. They masquerade as freedom fighters
and believe that they would compel India to give Jammu and
Kashmir to Pakistan. Only the insane can indulge in such
hallucinations.

Incidentally, with what face does Pakistan ask for talks with
India with the _jihadis_ continuing with their bombings and
killings? Of what use can any negotiations be in such a
murderous atmosphere? The world is naturally anxious because
of the nuclear apprehensions but the General in Pakistan must
first bring cross-border terrorism to a halt; it destroys all hopes
of establishing any peaceful relationship between the two
countries. Musharraf is being hypocritical for he himself has
told his people bluntly:

>We claim it \[Islam\] is the most tolerant
of faiths. How does the world judge our claim? It looks upon
us as terrorists. We have been killing each other. And now we
want to spread that violence and terror abroad. Naturally, the
world regards us as terrorists ... One hears the boast that we
will hoist our flag on the Red Fort. We will do this, we will do
that. Have you ever thought of the consequences of such talk
for Muslims in India.[^/0011004]

[^/0011004]:	_Frontline_, July 5, 2002.

By their brutal killings the _jihadis_ have made the life of
ordinary Muslims in India most uncomfortable; the communal
Hindus suspect, even if unjustifiably, that many Muslims nurse
some sympathy in their hearts for the terrorists. This is totally
baseless, but the Muslim leaders do little to rebut the
impression. They know that the issue of Jammu and Kashmir
is in some way linked with Indian Muslims; any settlement
with Pakistan is bound to have repercussions on Hindu--Muslim
relations. But instead of coming out openly against
Pakistan and taking a strong stand against the _jihadis_, these
so-called guardians of Indian Muslims spend most of their
time in running their own political shops to buttress their
communal leadership.

Some of them often whip up religious frenzy which only
further inflames communal tension and, in the end generates
more illwill among the Hindus. The worst affected by such
tactics have been the Muslims in the rural areas who constitute
more than 70% of the Muslim population in India.
They are troubled and distrusted by their Hindu neighbours
for no fault of theirs; consequently they have developed a fear
complex which makes them incapable of leading a peaceful
life. The Muslims in urban areas manage to shout and agitate;
they are even able to make some ripples but what is the end
result? None of these leaders visit villages so they are unaware
of the fallout of their actions on the poor and hapless who live
in the remote parts of the country.

There are no doubt some Hindus whose hearts bleed for
Muslims; but what sustains hatred among large sections of
Hindus against Muslims is the intellectual justification for it
by several leading Hindu intellectuals who proudly speak on
the distinction between "us" and "them". The Nobel laureate
V. S. Naipaul denounces Muslims en masse and justifies the
vengeance that has spread against them. This is not confined
to a small section; it has infected the rich as much as the poor;
men as much as women; the young as much as the old; even
children are no longer free from it. Parents are indoctrinating
them into a strange Muslim phobia; even teachers in schools
and lecturers in colleges use the worst epithets against Muslims.

Khushwant Singh, the most widely read commentator, has
expressed his horror at the contempt with which the
enlightened Hindus speak about Muslims:

>This can be seen
in the most sophisticated circles of Delhi: in the best of clubs,
diplomatic receptions and cocktail parties of the cream of the
capital's society. When they talk of Muslims or Islam, they
make snide remarks, innuendos and have smirky smiles on
their ugly faces --- Shrimans and Shrimatis alike. There are times
I feel like flinging the contents of my glass of whiskey in their
faces and walking out.[^/0011005]

[^/0011005]:	_Afternoon Despatch and Courier_, June 11, 2002.

This is the ugly reality that Muslims have to face in today's
India. They have to do their best to bring about a change in
the hostile attitude of the communal Hindus towards them.
This is as much in their interest as that of the nation. Muslims
continue to live in a make-believe world of their own. Their
leaders waste their energies in playing games, whipping up
emotions, and bringing more trouble to the ordinary Muslims.
Besides them, there are other "warriors," who are ever ready to
take cudgels on behalf of the community --- priests, academics,
journalists who add fuel to the fire. To quote the Nobel laureate
Amartya Sen,

>The dialectics of confrontation is powerfully
fed by intellectual confusion that spreads from the world of
academia to the world of journalism.[^/0011006]

These are inherited
habits which refuse to die; but Indian Muslims have to come
out of this quagmire and take their proper share in the
nation's development.

[^/0011006]:	_The Indian Express_, June 11, 2002.

They must also put the self-appointed champions of their
causes and defenders of their faith in their place. They have
done them enough harm; they must not be allowed to go on
with their confrontationist politics. Though Muslims in India
form the largest Muslim population in the world, next only to
Indonesia, they are, not like the Muslims in the fifty odd Muslim
countries, the rulers but are the ruled. They have neither power
nor privileges; they are no longer in a position to fight the
Hindus or get the better of them. Jinnah propagated the TwoNation
theory and Muslims supported him en masse. Much
earlier Savarkar among some other prominent Hindus had also
advocated the same; but the Hindus did not respond to their
plea. That is the difference which must be underlined. Gandhi
and Nehru had checkmated it. And now Muslims must take
the lead to bury this pernicious doctrine and work to unite
with the Hindus. Islam, as Rumi told the faithful, came to
unite people and not to divide them. The task is not going to
be easy because the communal Hindus have now risen to revive
Savarkar's long forgotten thesis of Hindus and Muslims
being two separate nations and implement it with a vengeance
so as to outdo even Jinnah. There are no Gandhis and
Nehrus in India now to negate its ill-effect; the task, therefore,
is most formidable.

Indian Muslims must, therefore, join hands with liberal
Hindus to work zealously for harmony between the two
communities; to succeed in this task they need to first change
their own behaviour, indeed their entire perception. They must
so conduct themselves as to conform to the requirements of
the changing circumstances; the need to preserve a multireligious
environment is urgent as well as basic to the
preservation of secularism. By their conduct they must gather
more and more Hindus on their side. This is as important as
safeguarding their religious and cultural heritage. There need
be no clash in pursuing both these obligations. But the will
and determination has to be there; for as Iqbal warned:

>Aieenay nau say darna tarzay kohan pay arna
>
>Manzil yehi kathin hai qaumon ki zindagi mein
>
>\
>
>To fear the new and to hold on to the old,
>
>That is the difficult path in a nation's life.

To succeed, Indian Muslims must boldly come forward to
undergo an all-round transformation in their style of
functioning. If they neglect or fail to do so then I am afraid to
quote Iqbal again, with a slight variation in the couplet, which
is more relevant today, they will be ruined.

>Na sambhjogey tau mit-jaaogey ai Hindi Musalmanon,
>
>Tumhaari daastaan tak bhee na hogi daastanon mein
>
>\ 
>
>O Indian Muslims, if you don't take care of yourself now
>
>Your story will not be there in the human annals.

They must remember the saying, "a hand caught between
an anvil and a hammer has no choice." History has
unfortunately put them in that position. The younger
generation in particular will therefore have to arm itself both
educationally and socially, in such a way that despite all
odds they can overcome the hurdles and ensure their future.
They have the intelligence and the energy, what is needed
now is the proper harnessing of these. For them aaraam
should be haraam.

In the words of Iqbal:

>Khoon-i-ragay memaar ki garmi say hai taameer
>
>Bey mehnat-i-paiham koyee johar nahee khilta
>
>\ 
>
>It is the mason's blood and sweat which builds the edifice
>
>Perpetual labour alone brings out the jewel's lustre.

They will succeed if parents shed their old habits, give up
their outdated notions, and encourage and help their sons
and daughters to get the best of education; the scope is wide
now with the old professions in greater demand and new
opportunities provided by computer education and
technological information. In the dozen colleges and institutes
of higher learning which I have founded, I find Muslim
girls are performing better than the boys, ranking in the
merit list in University exams. They have charisma, intellect
and more importantly, the urge to learn which should be
assiduously encouraged.

On their part, the young Muslims must try and acquire
excellence and perfection in their chosen fields and so arm
themselves that after the completion of their studies they can
be frontrunners wherever they go. Merit alone will give them
reward; they must never seek patronage. Their future will be
assured if their results are commensurate with the task entrusted
to them; in that case they will be able to cut across the
communal prejudice against them. At the same time they
should cultivate an attachment to both their Indian and Islamic
heritage, exhibiting pride in them in equal measure. They must
face new challenges, boldly and fearlessly. These days Islam
has been much distorted by Muslim themselves; its noble values
are openly violated by its own votaries for selfish purposes thus
shattering its glorious legacy of enlightenment and intellectual
advancement; it is for the young Muslims to revoke the wrong
and revive the right.

Islam needs to be projected, in view of the ill-informed
propaganda against it, in its true pristine colour --- as a dynamic,
progressive force which teaches its followers to move forward,
never backward. They must, by their forceful and constructive
exertions, reclaim Islam's past heritage and bring back the spirit
of compassion which some of their greatest saints and
philosophers, poets and scientists, fostered through their
immemorial works. They brought fraternity where hostility
prevailed. Indian Muslims must disarm the _jihadis_ and disown
the bigotism which has made Muslims pariahs everywhere.
They must, by their example, transmit Islam's message of
tolerance and brotherhood to the world and give to the nonMuslims
the assurance that their religion stands for "live and
let live". Their reformation should rejuvenate Islam and be
the beacon light for the rest of the Muslim world which is still
mired in obscurantism and totalitarian framework. The values
of democracy, human rights and civil liberties that India has
nurtured and under which she has flourished should help
Indian Muslims to give the right lead to the oppressed Muslims,
wherever they be.

They must also direct their energies in taking full advantage
of globalization and try to utilise fully their talents to come on
the top. That is how the most oppressed have always redeemed
their destiny. The Jews were the most prosecuted in the West
for many centuries; but they strived hard and fully utilized
their talents. They worked so strenuously that they won laurels
in every discipline and achieved distinction in every field.
Today they exercise enormous influence in every sector,
science, literature, finance and even politics. That is the way
to overcome the plight in which circumstances have landed
Indian Muslims. They must heed what the Urdu poet Sikandar
Ali Wajd told them and aim to reach the highest peak of
achievement:

>Aghyaar mehr-o-maah say aagay nikal gaye
>
>Uljhe huyae hain, subha ki pehli kiran say hum
>
>\ 
>
>Others have gone beyond the moon and the sun
>
>While we are still struggling with the first ray of the sun.

The Quran admonishes the faithful that "God never
changes the condition of a people unless they themselves want
to change it." Will the Indian Muslims accept the challenge
to change and reorientate their mindset?

In the first place they must put their House in order and so
equip themselves as to meet the modern requirements. The
orthodox clerics who shut themselves up from the world, must
not be allowed to lock the Muslims in such a way that they
are restrained from going ahead and partaking of the benefits
of the technological advancement and the opportunities that
the democratic forces offer.

They must, without compromising the Quranic injunctions,
agree to the introduction of certain much-needed, essential
changes in their Personal Law, particularly the enactment of
monogamy; this will bring them on a par with non-Muslims.
It was strongly urged by Justice Ameer Ali and Justice Syed
Mahmud in the past and is even today advocated by the
ideologue of the Muslim Brotherhood. Muhammad Qutb, the
brother of Sayyid Qutb opined that it was the preferable
Quranic alternative. Surprisingly, it was Jinnah, who on an
earlier occasion, pointed out how Muslims cooperated with
non-Muslims to accept secular legislation.

He said,

>For instance, Islamic criminal law of contract is
no more applicable. Islamic criminal law which remained
applicable even during the British period now stands wholly
repealed. The Islamic law of evidence is nowhere found in
this country. Over and above, there is the recently enacted
Caste Disabilities Removal Act, 1850 which has the effect of
abrogating the Quranic provision under which an apostate is
deprived of his right to inheritance. I submit these as examples
which we have to follow so that we may keep pace with the
present social needs and requirements of the time, for which
many precedents are found in the Islamic legal history itself.[^/0011007]

[^/0011007]:	Pandey, Gyanendra, _Hindus and Others --- The Question of Identity in India Today_, New Delhi, 1994, pp. 182--183.

Many recent judgements of the various High Courts and
the Supreme Court, which alone decide the disputes of Muslim
Personal Law, have introduced substantial reforms; these have
been quietly accepted by the community. The process must
be taken forward; Muslims must not allow themselves to be
hidebound by what the classical jurists in the past had ordained.

There is, in fact, enough scope under the Shariah to amend
the laws relating to marriage, divorce, dower and even
maintenance. In the law of divorce, as early as in 1939, vital
changes were made by the then Central Legislative Assembly
by enacting the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, under
which a Muslim wife was given the right of divorce under
certain circumstances. Dower is in fact a counter to dowry;
under it the husband is required to pay a certain amount to
the wife at the time of marriage. It is a commitment which has
to be honoured by him. Only in regard to inheritance no
substantial change is possible nor is it necessary because the
Muslim law of inheritance is quite progressive. As I had
explained to the late Mrs. Indira Gandhi, why should anyone
bother about inheritance when 95% of the Muslims in
India die as paupers. The remaining five % can do what
they like with their inherited assets; why ask them to violate
the Quranic injunction?

Ijtihad, (independent thinking) which was freely used by
the classical jurists in the past, needs to be exercised by the
present generation much more today; this was also actively
advocated both by Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan and Allama Iqbal,
who exerted the greatest influence on the thinking of Indian
Muslims in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
respectively. They deprecated the Ulamas' emphasis on taqlid
or imitation. Both reformers believed that the Quran embodied
an essentially dynamic outlook on life and encouraged each
generation to chalk out its own course of action, unhampered
by the past. Iqbal went to the extent of dismissing the standard
works of the Shariah and said that no theologian, however
eminent, had the right to give finality or crystallize legal
thought in Islam.

The Allama has categorically declared:

>The claim of the
present generation of Muslim liberals to re-interpret the
foundational legal principles, in the light of their own
experience and the altered conditions of modern life is, in my
opinion, perfectly justified. The teaching of the Quran that
life is a process of progressive creation necessitates that each
generation, guided but unhampered by the work of its
predecessors, should be permitted to solve its own problems.[^/0011008]

Likewise the issue of Babri Masjid must be amicably solved;
it was badly handled by interested groups with the result that
they could not prevent its demolition. Muslim fears on account
of the Hindu movement against it did create considerable
unease about the preservation of mosques in general; but
instead of talking it over with responsible elements among the
Hindus, confrontation was adopted to press the point. This
gave rise to more hatred against the Muslims, who have now
agreed to accept the verdict of the court. Much blood could
have been spared if genuine efforts at conciliation were made
earlier. Unfortunately neither side tried sincerely; they believed
in fighting it out. For almost a decade they have done so;
Babri Masjid could not be saved; meanwhile hundreds of
mosques and dargahs in Gujarat have been razed to the ground
and the same is true of some parts of Maharashtra as well.
What have the Muslims leaders really gained by mounting
agitation after agitation? Have they been able to protect the
sacred places of the Muslims. A different approach has to be
evolved to obtain the desired results.

The controversy on the singing of Vande mataram by
Muslims is also meaningless. It was sung by all Muslim leaders,
belonging to the Congress, during the freedom struggle. In his
fight against the Congress in the late thirties of the last century
Jinnah raked it up by saying it was against a tenet of Islam, as
it calls upon people to prostrate before the mother (land). But
it does not; the Sanskrit word means "bow" and not
"prostrate". Those Muslims, who do not want to sing it, may
not but they must stand up when it is sung as a mark of respect
to an anthem which has a hoary past and is declared as a
national song in the Constitution. Why add hurt to an already
worsening inter-communal relationship.

Hindus are also piqued by the fact that Muslims are
multiplying fast, much more than Hindus. The Census figures,
decade after decade, confirm it. The two major causes for this
disparity are said to be, first, that a Muslim can have four wives
at a time and secondly, his reluctance on religious grounds to
adopt family planning. A VHP pamphlet propagates it thus:

>In order to appease them, the Muslims of India have been
allowed to marry four wives, a practice now disallowed even
in Muslim countries. As a result, the population of Muslims in
India which stood at 25 million at the time of Partition, has
shot up to nearly 100 million, whereas the population of
Hindus has only doubled since then. According to the findings
of the UNO, 25 years hence the Hindu count will shrink to
less than 50% of the country's population since their
growth rate is only 23.69% as compared to the 30.85% in the case of Muslims.

This is a gross misrepresentation of the actual facts; it is
done with a view to scare the Hindus. Demographers are agreed
that even if the rate of growth of Hindus and Muslims continues
to be the same, the Muslim population in the next 25 years
will rise to 13.55%. To equal the Hindus, Muslims will
need no less than 365 years. This, of course, presupposes that
religion alone is the cause of higher growth, a fact that has
been universally rejected by demographers, who have proved
by statistical analysis that the major influence on the fertility
behaviour of a people is the socio-economic factor.

In his highly acclaimed study, Aspects of Fertility: With Special
Reference to Developing Countries, the revered sociologist R.H.
Chaudhury has noted:

>The observed differences in fertility
are mostly due to socio-economic differences between Muslims
and other religious groups. Once these differences are
accounted for, the fertility differences between Muslims and
other religious groups will largely disappear.

This is also borne
out by the fact that while the fertility rate, both of Hindus and
Muslims, is low in economically advanced states like Kerala,
Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat, it is high
in both communities in economically backward states like
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.

The two most important reasons for higher fertility are
poverty and lack of education, especially among women. The
number of infant deaths among Muslims is also much higher
than among Hindus which also is a check on population
growth. Nevertheless there is the psychological factor, which
Muslims must consider in order to reassure the Hindus,
however, unjustified their fear may be. It revolves round
polygamy which communal Hindus believe is the cause of the
multiplication of Muslims. They can easily give it up though
according to Prof. Mohan Rao of JNU, the rate of growth
has little to do with polygamous marriages. In fact the
number of Hindus with more than one wife is higher than
that among Muslims.

This is substantiated by figures provided by the Census
Commissioner and Registrar General:

>In India as a whole,
the incidence of polygamous marriages is the highest among
the persons declaring their religion as tribal religion (12.25%), next come the Buddhists (7.97%) followed
by the Jains (6.72%). Then come caste-Hindus and
last, the Muslims. This has also been endorsed by the
Anthropological Survey of India which has been carrying on
an ambitious project through field investigations into different
aspects of human endeavour. After surveying 4,635
communities and sub-communities in nearly 5,500 villages
and towns throughout India, the Survey states that the
incidence of polygamy is rare among the Muslims because most
of them have no money to marry four times.

Hence, the real reason for the increase in the rate of growth
of population among Indian Muslims is their growing poverty.
There is also the urban-rural disparity; 66% of Muslims
live in urban areas as against 22% Hindus. They are
huddled together in slums with no recreational facilities; they
live almost like animals. Carnal indulgence seems to be their
only pleasure with no understanding of preventive measures
which leads to frequent pregnancies. This has been vividly
brought out by field surveys conducted by research organizations.

Whatever be the statistics, communal Hindus don't accept
them: numbers, they say, can be made to lie. They are, by and
large, convinced that polygamy results in an increased rate of
growth of people. It is, therefore, not in the interest of Indian
Muslims to persist with it which in any case they don't practise.
It is also not obligatory for them under the Shariah; the relevant
Quranic verse 3 in surah al-Nissa is clear on the point:

>Marry women who seem good to you,
>
>Two or three or four in number.
>
>However, if you fear
>
>That you may not be able to act
>
>Equitably towards all,
>
>Then marry only one.

This is followed in the same surah by verse 129 which
makes it abundantly clear that monogamy is the preferred
alternative; it reads:

>You will never be able to deal equitably
> 
>With all your wives, however much you may want.

Then there is the question of family planning, on which
much of our progress depends; it cannot be denied. that
Muslims have not taken to it as seriously as Hindus; this has to
be corrected. There must be a vigorous campaign for its
implementation among Muslims and their leaders in every
sector must engage themselves to persuade them to adopt it so
that they do not lag behind Hindus in fulfilling this most urgent
task, without which India cannot succeed in eradicating
poverty. There is, however, no truth in the allegation that
Islam prohibits family planning. Many educated and secularminded
Hindus also hold this view. It is widely believed that
Islam does not permit its followers even to adopt contraceptive
methods. There is no basis for it in the Quran; most Muslim
countries have adopted it and all heads of Muslim countries
have subscribed to the UN Declaration endorsing it. Even
Al-Azhar, the highest centre of Islamic theology has given a
fatwa in its favour. Imam Ghazali (1058--1111), whom Muslims
hold in the highest esteem and revere him as "the rejuvenator
of the faith", has commended birth control under certain
circumstances.

The rage of the communal Hindus against the Muslims,
however politically motivated, can be overcome by the
Muslims if they make a sustained effort effort to convince them
that they should have no fear of them and assure them that
they harbour no enemity towards them nor are they in a secret
conspiracy with Muslims elsewhere to harm them. They are
as much the sons of the soil as Hindus and as committed to its
glory and prosperity as Hindus are. The misdeeds of some of
the Muslim rulers in the past and a few of the self-appointed
Muslim leaders in the present should not blind Hindus to the
fact that their ties with Muslims are old and strong and cannot
be broken, whatever be the odds. As Sardar Patel said,
just as the waters of the rivers can not be separated so also
Hindus and Muslims. There is much more common between
the two communities than the differences that are talked about.
In recent years the negative part of their relationship has been
focussed due to certain unfortunate incidents; these have been
exploited to foment the rage among the communal Hindus
against the Muslims.

The best way to overcome it is for the two of them to
know each other better, to appreciate the true facets of their
relationship and to remove the causes that have brought about
the alienation. Once the goodwill, mutual trust and confidence
are restored, they will be able to bring to the fore the wealth
of their many-splendoured collaboration in every field, which
spreads over a thousand years. That is the crying need of our
times; India demands of both Hindus and Muslims to work
for accord and not discord. Ben Jonson said: "All accord is
born of contraries", while the Pope said: "All discord is born of
harmony not understood". India contains the second largest
Muslim population in the world; it cannot be wished away.
It is an integral part of the nation. And a nation, as Lincoln
told the Americans on the eve of the civil war, which is divided
against itself, cannot stand.

These words of wisdom should awaken both the
communities to the urgent need of rebuilding India, as a united,
strong and prosperous nation, so that it ensures stability and
security for the people; for this a realistic understanding of
each others' needs and difficulties has to be sincerely fostered;
Hindus and Muslims must realize that hate will only corrode
their energies and weaken national strength. Allama Iqbal,
who gave us in the days when nationalist fervour had gripped
him, the soul-stirring and immortal anthem: Saare Jehaan say
achaha Hindustan Hamaaraa, had also written another famous
poem at the same time called Naya shawala, the new shrine.
Through its evocative words he called upon Hindus and
Muslims to erect a new temple of unity; it was to outshine all
other shrines. Such a temple is needed today more than ever
before. The poet sang in Urdu and I translate it here:

>If you don't mind, oh Brahmin
>
>I must tell the truth ---
>
>These idols in your temples
>
>These idols have grown old.
>
>They teach you to hate your kith and kin
>
>So does the Mullah, climb the pulpit
>
>And preach aggression and war.
>
>In disgust, I have shut my ears
>
>To the chants and the calls
>
>From both, the temple and the mosque.
>
>In stone, oh Brahmin, you seek God
>
>I see Him in the dust of my motherland.
>
>Let the temple bells mingle with the muezzin's call,
>
>Let us erase every trace of alienation
>
>And break the barriers of separation.
>
>Let us build a new temple of unity,
>
>The grandest, whose spears will reach the sky;
>
>Let the devotees drink the elixir of unity
>
>And sing the song binding the bonds of harmony
>
>For human liberation lies in love and compassion.

There must be a real awareness among Indian Muslims that
they have to gird up their loins and prepare for reconciliation
with Hindus on the basis that each respects the religious and
cultural conventions, traditions and sentiments of the other.
It has to be, as Gandhiji used to say, a true "union of hearts".
An Urdu poet has cautioned:

>Safeena choor, saahil door,
>
>bebus naakhuda leikin
>
>Saaharey sau gaye
>
>tau be-saaharey tum na sau jao
>
>\ 
>
>The boat is battered
>
>The shores far, far away,
>
>The captain has given up hope
>
>But you cannot go into slumber.
>
>Awake, whatever the odds
>
>And row on, undaunted
>
>Until you reach the shores.

What Indian Muslims have to understand is that eventually
it is not their leaders but they themselves who will have to
make their destiny. Even during the days of Sir Sayyid Ahmad
Khan, who was triumphantly going ahead on the path of
transformation and rejuvenation of his co-religionists, the
popular Urdu poet Akbar Allahabadi, known for his wit and
wisdom, was impatient and unhappy with the response of the
community. He therefore appealed to them in these words:

>Aik Sayyid kya karey or baith kar dus kya karein?
>
>Hazrat-e-Hali key ashaar-e-Mussaddus kya karein?
>
>Dar haqueekat meharbaani quom ki durkaar hai
>
>Hum akailey, bekuso zaar-o-beybus, kya karein
>
>\ 
>
>What can one Sayyid --- or even ten put together do?
>
>What can even the inspiring verse of Hali fulfil?
>
>Truly, it is the community which must respond and act;
>
>Feople like us --- forlorn and helpless ---
>
>What can we alone do?
