# Foreword

Alexander Pope has described how one can "die of
nothing but a rage to live." That could be tragic
enough, but nothing like the massive catastrophe when
thousands die not of their own "rage to live," but of the
"rage to kill" of genocidal brutes looking for an opportunity
to slaughter. The Gujarat massacre, unrestrained by a state
government that proved to be, at best, grossly incompetent
but very likely a great deal worse, is a manifestation of
vicious sectarian politics that is doing its best to turn
India into a barbaric country of which every citizen has
reason to be ashamed.

Shame, however, is not enough. First, shame alone will
not stop slaughter, especially when one group kills while others
are ashamed. To prevent any recurrence of similar carnage in
the future (with or without the misfortune of being in a state
ruled by Narendra Modi), we have to examine the causal
processes that lead to such barbarities. Second, while massacre
is the brutal end of the nastiness of communal politics, that
nastiness can --- and does --- take many other forms as well,
making millions of people deeply insecure and threatening
the very integrity of the nation itself. The Gujarat butchery is
more than a communal slaughter; it reflects a diabolic
beastliness that communal sectarians have planted well into
India's body politic.

This reasoned and moving book by the highly respected
Rafiq Zakaria is a powerful attempt at analyzing the communal
peril that India faces which threatens the future of India as a
secular democracy. Zakaria says, in the Preface, that he "could
not help writing this book." I must confess we have reason to
welcome Zakaria's helplessness. His writings have illuminated
important parts of Indian politics for many decades, and his
readers would like to know what this veteran analyst thinks
of the recent events, and how he interprets the threats that
India faces today and has to tackle tomorrow. The old readers
of Zakaria, including this one, would also like to see how
Zakaria's earlier thoughts respond to the new reality that has
been unfolding. I am happy to be able to say that the readers
will be richly rewarded by the cogency and force of this
extremely timely book.

Zakaria presents, with much clarity, his diagnosis of what
has changed in Indian sectarian politics. The earlier
manifestation of what he calls "the communal phenomenon"
was more among the Muslims than the Hindus, and it
contributed --- aided by the rage it generated --- to the partition
of India. This is, of course, only an over-rapid summary; there
is a fuller story, and readers of Rafiq Zakaria's earlier books
would know how he analyzed the complex events leading to
the partition, and his scrutiny of the respective roles of Gandhi,
Nehru and Jinnah in the politics of the day. But things have
taken a very different turn since the partition, with Hindu
communalism in ascendancy. In an earlier book, The Widening
Divide, Zakaria has already diagnosed a growing alienation
between the two communities. There has been a monotonic
increase in the barrier between the two communities, decade
by decade, and what had begun as a by-product of the British
rule has now become a fixed and extensive feature of the
politics of contemporary India.

The process has been fed by communal Hindu politics,
fostering divisiveness ("indirectly aping Jinnah," as Zakaria
sees it), combined with plentiful use of religious
misinterpretations and historical distortions to alienate Hindus
from their Muslim fellow citizens. Zakaria identifies the
importance of countering the falsities on the basis of which
the motivated alienation has been nurtured and cultivated.
He scrutinizes these claims and accusations, and presents his
well-considered response to each. This is part of what Zakaria
sees has to be done now, but elsewhere in this wide-ranging
book, he presents his advices and admonitions on more
attitudinal issues. The book speaks to all, but Zakaria pays
particular attention to addressing those groups which have
an interest in reducing the alienation that endangers India.
The overall object of the book is to reduce the power and
influence of "the divisive forces that threaten the secular
character of our polity."

The contribution that this book makes can be put in three
different baskets --- each with importance of its own. First,
the analysis of what is currently happening, seen in historical
perspective, is itself a significant contribution, especially in
the seasoned hands of Rafiq Zakaria.

Second, the particular arguments and counter-arguments
that Zakaria presents illuminate the debates surrounding these
issues, and I would particularly refer the reader to the chapters
"Historical Distortions" and "Religious Misconceptions," and
also the one called "Shivaji and Vivekananda" (where Zakaria
shows that the thoughts of these great leaders were altogether
different from those of the Hindu communalists who invoke
them and who attribute to them ideologies that each would
have found revolting).

Last but by no means least, Zakaria uses his wellestablished
and well-deserved reputation to ask some
questions that others too would have to address in their
own ways. The book is, in this sense, also a constructive
invitation to discuss and debate. I will take the liberty
of raising two particular points I would like to add to what
Zakaria himself says.

The first point concerns the identities and perspectives of
those who belong to a community not in the sense of having
(or attaching particular importance to) the corresponding
religious beliefs (whether Hindu or Muslim), but in the sense
of genealogy and the sharing of some social practice. The
counting of Hindus and Muslims in a census cannot but be
different from a survey of religious beliefs. Confusions between
the two are skilfully exploited by sectarian politicians,
by taking genealogical identity to be the same as religious
identity. Is this not a further issue to investigate, going beyond
allegedly religion-based classifications, since the categories
can be rather different?

Second, everyone has many identities, related not just to
one's religion and community, but also to class, occupation,
language, gender, political inclinations, and so on. Is there a
danger that in seeing a person in terms of his or her religion,
we can lose other aspects of the person's individuality? When
I was growing up in Bengal in the bloody 1940s, I remember
being struck --- even as a child --- by the fact that the victims
of the riots overwhelmingly came from the same class, even
when they belonged to different communities or religious
groups. When a riot erupts, the thugs and the killers in each
group try to slaughter the easiest targets in the "opposite" group:
those who live in slums (not solid houses) and who have to
go out to earn their meagre income (come what may). The
class identity of the victims --- whether Hindu or Muslim ---
was frequently much the same while their communal identities
were divergent. Do we, then, need to supplement the kind of
questions that Zakaria raises (his movingly written last chapter
is called "What Should Muslims Do?") by other questions that
concentrate on other identities ("how should slum-dwellers
resist?", "what can workers and working class organizations
do?", "what should intellectuals try to achieve?", "what do
the community of lawyers owe to the country?" and so on).
Resisting the assumed primacy of categorization of people
according to religious beliefs or communities can be a very
important part of an anti-communalist strategy.

Among the important contributions that Rafiq Zakaria
makes in this inspiring book is to invite us to address, in the
best way we can, the gigantic threat that India faces. The
one thing we cannot do is to do nothing. Zakaria's confession
that he "could not help writing this book" also implores us all
to address the terrible threat that India faces from communal
politics. The monograph is the outcome, as Zakaria explains,
of a "deep anguish" which he has gone through "as an Indian."
That anguish cannot but be shared by us all. The book is a
stirring call as well as an illuminating analysis. We have to
respond to each.
