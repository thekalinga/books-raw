# Godhra Massacre

Charles Dickens, one of the greatest novelists of all
times, begins his immortal classic, A Tale of Two
Cities thus:

>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was
the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the
season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring
of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before
us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to
Heaven, we were all going direct the other way ...[^/001001]

[^/001001]:	The eighteenth-century New Age, evoked by Charles Dickens, at the beginning of _A Tale of Two Cities_.

For those of us who, even after what has happened in
Gujarat, still believe in Hindu--Muslim unity, these have been
the worst of times, the age of foolishness, the epoch of
incredulity, the season of darkness, the winter of despair;
instead of going to heaven, these happenings threatened to
take us straight to hell. Godhra and its aftermath in the rest of
Gujarat are the worst blots on India's face admitted Prime
Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. They took the most bestial
form known to our history. What is shocking is that these
gruesome happenings took place in a state which had given
birth to Gandhi, brought him up and nurtured him for
the best part of his early public life, when he gave the
message of non-violence, not only to his people but also
to the rest of the human race.

The place where the first incident occurred is Godhra, a
small town in Panchmahal district of Gujarat. It is about 150
kilometres from Ahmedabad. It has a mixed population of
Hindus and Muslims of over two lakhs. Since Independence
it witnessed several communal riots: the earliest was in 1948
when over a hundred persons were killed. Thereafter peace
prevailed between the two communities for twenty six years
until 1968. Then it was shattered once again. There was no
communal disturbance thereafter for another fifteen years. In
1980 a fierce clash erupted between Hindus and Muslims.
Again in 1990 and then in 1992 riots took place in the town.
And finally came the gruesome torching of Hindus on that
eerie day in February 2002. The town has therefore always
been prone to communal riots and it is really surprising that
the authorities, despite rumours of verbal clashes for weeks
between the two communal groups, failed to take any
precautionary measures. It seems they were completely in the
dark about what went on around them.

The culprits of the Godhra carnage were allegedly Muslims,
belonging to a sect known as the Ghanchis who live by
crushing oil seeds. They bear Muslim names but are illiterate
and absolutely ignorant of the teachings of Islam; they allegedly
acted in the most inhuman manner, torching the families of
the kar sevaks --- men, women and children --- who were
travelling in the ill-fated Sabarmati Express; within minutes
the whole bogie was burnt down, reducing to ashes all the
inmates and their belongings.

It presented a ghastly sight and those who witnessed it felt
not only deep pain and anguish but seething anger against
the perpetrators of such a gruesome act. Since they were
Muslims, the incident took a communal turn instantly. As soon
as the news spread, Hindus came out in the streets in different
parts of Gujarat and in all their fury targeted innocent and
helpless Muslims who had nothing to do with what the
Ghanchis had allegedly done in Godhra; they were brutalized
by miscreants who were let loose; their women were mercilessly
raped and men, women and children were burnt alive. It was
the unkindest travesty of justice.

Surprisingly, even Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who
has been the secular oasis in the Hindutva's communal desert,
came out in his speech in Goa with the question: "Who lit
the fire?" Instead of going for the perpetrators and punishing
them, why were the innocent and helpless Muslims punished;
what was their crime? Those who lit the fire should have been
targeted but they are yet to be detected. What was shocking
was the brutal manner in which the retaliation was connived
at by the police and in some cases, even witnessed by them
without lifting a finger to stop it. Worse, they hardly did anything
to find out the culprits and investigate how and why they committed
the horrendous act at Godhra.

Different versions of its occurrence have appeared in the
press and on the electronic media. At one time it was officially
stated that it was a terrorist attack, pre-planned by the ISI of
Pakistan. An objective account, after intensive questioning of
officials and witnesses is provided by Rajiv Chandrasekaran,
the correspondent of Washington Post:

>For two days, as the
>Sabarmati Express sneaked across northern India, some Hindu
>activists in cars S-5 and S-6 carried on like hooligans. They
>exposed themselves to other passengers. They pulled
>headscarves off Muslim women. They evicted a family of four
>in the middle of the night for refusing to join in chants
>glorifying the Hindu god Ram. They failed to pay for the tea
>and snacks they consumed at each shop.
>
>When the train pulled into this hardscrabble town in
>western India on the morning of February 27, the reputation
>of its rowdiest passengers preceded it. When they refused to pay
>for their food, Muslim boys among the vendors at Godhra station
>stormed the train. Interviews with passengers on the train,
>witnesses to the incident and police and railway officials suggest
>that the train fire was not a premeditated ambush by young
>Muslims, but a spontaneous reaction, provoked by Hindu
>activists, that went out of control. 'Both sides were at fault',
>said a police official here, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
>'The provocation was there and the reaction was strong. But
>no one had imagined this would turn into such a big tragedy'.[^/001002]

_Mainstream_, the leftist weekly founded by Nikhil
Chakravartty, has given a different version of an eye-witness
to the whole Godhra incident; it reads as follows:

>The actual
story didn't start at Godhra as is being told everywhere but it
started from Daahod, 75 kilometres before the Godhra railway
station. At about 5.30 to 6.00 a.m. the train reached Daahod
railway station. These kar sevaks, after having tea and snacks at
the railway stall, broke down the stall following some argument
with the stall owner and they proceeded back to the departing
train. The stall owner then filed an NC against the kar sevaks at
the local police station about the above incident. At about
7.00 or 7.15 a.m. the train reached the Godhra railway station.
All the kar sevaks came out from their reserved compartments
and started to have tea and snacks at the small tea stall on the
platform which was being run by an old bearded man from the
minority community. There was a servant helping the old man
in the stall. The kar sevaks on purpose argued with the old man
and then beat him up and pulled his beard. This was all planned
to humiliate the old man since he was from the minority
community. The kar sevaks kept repeating the slogan,
'Mandir ka nirmaan karo, Babur ki aulad ko bahar karo'
(Start building the Mandir and throw the sons of Babur --- that is,
Muslims --- out of the country).[^/001003]

[^/001003]:	_Mainstream_, March 30, 2002.

This is what eyewitnesses narrated to the correspondent:
Thereafter, they said, the situation took a turn for the worse.
The sixteen year old daughter of the old man who was also
present at the station came forward and tried to save her father
from the kar sevaks. She kept pleading with them to stop beating
her father and to leave him alone. But instead of listening
to her pleadings, the kar sevaks lifted the young girl and took
her inside their compartment (S-6) and closed the
compartment door. The train started to move out of the
platform of the Godhra railway station. The old man kept
banging on the compartment and begged the kar sevaks
to let go of his daughter.

An eyewitness recounted:

>Just before the train could move
out from the platform, two stall vendors jumped into the last
bogie that comes after the guard's cabin. And with the
intention of saving the girl they pulled the chain and stopped
the train. By the time the train halted completely, it was one
kilometre away from the railway station. The two men then
came to the bogie in which the girl was and started banging
the door, requesting the kar sevaks to let go of the girl. As a
result of the commotion, people in the vicinity near the tracks
started moving towards the train. The boys and the mob
(which included women) had by then gathered near the
compartment. They requested the kar sevaks to return the girl
to her father. But they did not agree; instead they shut the
windows of the bogie. This infuriated the mob and they
retaliated by pelting stones at the compartment.[^/001004]

[^/001004]:	_Ibid_.

Continuing his report, the correspondent wrote:

>The
compartments adjoining compartment S-6 on either side had
kar sevaks, carrying banners that had long bamboo sticks
attached to them. The kar sevaks got down and started
attacking with those bamboo sticks; a mob gathered to save
the girl. This further angered the crowd; they brought diesel
and petrol from trucks and rickshaws standing at the garages
in Signal Falia (a place in Godhra) and burnt the compartment.
In retaliation the kar sevaks in the other compartments got
down and started burning down the garages in Signal
Falia including Badshah Masjid at Shehra Bhagaad ...[^/001005]

There
was no mention of the fate of the girl; apparently she
was also torched along with all the passengers who included
women and children.

[^/001005]:	_Ibid_.

Prem Shankar Jha in his column in the prestigious magazine
_Outlook_ wrote that it must have been a planned affair:

>It is
barely possible that the dispute arose out of a fracas between
kar sevaks and Muslim vendors in Vadodara, or on the train.
The VHP and Bajrang Dal are not exactly known for their
sensitivity to the sentiments of the minority community and
may have cast aspersions on Islam that brought forth this
unwonted, although still utterly condemnable reaction.
However, if the reaction had been spontaneous, it would almost
certainly have taken several hours to gather force and would
have taken place in Vadodara and not 150 kms away. Even
the theory floating around that the persons who had been
roughed up in Vadodara rang up co-religionists in Godhra and
set off the conflagration sounds far-fetched, for the attack on
the train was too well organized and too cold-blooded to have
been organized in the two hours or so that the train took to
get there. Thus one cannot rule out the possibility that
the attack was planned, was intended to occur after the
Ayodhya meeting of VHP kar sevaks, and was instigated
by outside elements.[^/001006]

[^/001006]:	_Outlook_, March 11, 2002.

According to Azam Shahab, who interviewed several eyewitnesses
in Godhra for the Urdu daily Hindustan of Mumbai,
he did not find a shred of evidence to justify the theory that
the scorching of the men, women and children in the
Sabarmati Express was a planned affair. He said that when
news spread like wild fire of a Muslim girl having been
kidnapped by the kar sevaks and detained in the bogie of the
said train, which some miscreants had burnt, the locals in their
hundreds rushed to see what was happening; some of them, in
fact, tried to put off the fire. None of them, he said, brought
any petrol bombs or _lathis_ with them. It was just a natural
reaction of people, who ran to witness the sordid affair. This
has been confirmed, according to Shahab, by the report of the
railway police, submitted to the authorities on April 15, 2002.
Azam has also asked in his despatches as to why would
Muslims, as alleged, burn bogie no.6, which only contained
fifteen kar sevaks and not the other bogies, which had hundreds
of kar sevaks in them? If it was done to rescue the kidnapped
girl, it would be the height of madness on their part, to burn
the bogie, when the girl detained by the kar sevaks was
in that bogie?[^/001007]

[^/001007]:	Jeh Shahab, Azam, _Gujarat Kay Rat Din_, published by _Hindustan_, Mumbai, pp. 27--32.

Until now there is no confirmation of any single version
by the authorities. This is not to justify the burning of the
train or the scorching of the innocent men, women and
children in Godhra; whatever the provocation, the culprits
were brutes and those who joined them in this heinous crime
deserve the maximum punishment. As Muslims, according to
the Quran, in the life hereafter, they would burn in fire forever.
All the same, people are entitled to know how all this took
place. Some arrests have been made; some have also been
charge-sheeted; but the real version has not been made public
as yet. That is indeed intriguing; it is not enough to condemn
the crime or arrest a few suspects; but in the larger interest of
restoring peace and communal harmony it was imperative on
the part of the authorities to get at the truth with all its
ramifications? In fact the truth should have been instantly
found out and told without the slightest delay; had this been
done, the carnage that followed could have been contained
to a large extent. The delay caused the fire to be lit which
engulfed the rest of Gujarat in it. And now to give a routine
reply that the judge, appointed to investigate, will look into
it, can hardly help restore the confidence of the people. They
know it will take years for the judge to submit his report.

The National Human Rights Commission had
recommended that the investigation should be entrusted,
without any loss of time, to the CBI; unfortunately this was
not done. The entire probe was carried out in the usual slipshod
manner. Jyoti Punwani, an experienced and highly respected
investigating reporter revealed a confounding picture of "the
callous and careless way in which it was carried out by the
local police" and how the state was deliberately downplaying
the whole incident. She wrote that the police stopped the
train at 9.30 pm and the bogie was burnt between 7.20 and
8.30 pm. This was the First Information Report. But the
documents filed by the police before the courts gives
the time as the night of February 27. In the driver's complaint
it was mentioned that some persons were arrested on
the spot. However the remand application of the first 30
people to be arrested was made much before at 21.30 hours
(9.30 pm), February 27.

Punwani points out:

>This is only the most glaring of
contradictions in the case papers of this crime, which sparked
off the Gujarat violence and which is described as a deep-rooted
all-India conspiracy. There are two offences registered
about the train incident. The first, CR 9/2002, names unknown
accused and deals with the entire incident from the time the
train arrived at Godhra station. The complainant here is the
driver. The second, CR 10/2002, is based on a complaint filed
by sub-inspector Jhala of the Gujarat Railway Police. It pertains
to offences that allegedly took place at the railway station after
the Sabarmati Express was burnt.

On that basis eleven Muslims
were arrested and the complaint against them by Jhala forms
part of their remand application.

Punwani is however intrigued by this development. She
states:

>The complaint tells a hitherto untold story. More
importantly, the facts in it do not tally with those in CR 9/2002. Jhala's complaint says that after the burning of the
Sabarmati Express, the local police and the railway police
rounded up 15 people. While the police were interrogating
them, at around 11 a.m., a mob of 3,000 armed with kerosene
and lethal weapons tried to snatch the 15 people from the
police and began pelting stones at them. The complaint says
the mob tried to murder passengers and set fire to the other
bogies of the Sabarmati Express. The police dispersed them by
a _lathi-charge_, tear gas and finally firing, in which one person,
who was carrying a sword, was injured. This complaint was
filed at 23.40 hours (11.40 p.m.), February 27, 11 hours.
after the offence. The railway police station is at Godhra
railway station itself.[^/001008]

[^/001008]:	_Mid-Day_, April 22, 2002.

There is no information about the 15 people who were
arrested on the spot. Who were they? Where were they
interrogated? Were they the same as accused numbers 1 to 15 in
CR 9/2002, who were also arrested on the spot for burning the
train? But their arrests took place at 21.30 hours. However in
the complaint neither any policeman nor a passenger was shown
to have been injured. And though Section 436 of the Indian
Penal Code had been applied to them which deals with burning
homes, Jhala's complaint did not mention any such attempt.

Punwani asks further questions:

>Who pulled the chain
which led to the train stopping outside Signal Falia? The driver
of the train has, in his complaint, stated that the residents of
Signal Falia did so. This implies that some of the Muslims of
Signal Falia entered the train and pulled the chain, while others
outside stoned and then burnt the coach. It is worth noting
that the second chain-pulling has been traced to S-6, the very
coach that was burnt. Strangely, the driver has failed to give
any description of those who made up or at least led the mob
at Signal Falia --- neither their age, sex, nor physical
appearance ...[^/001009]

[^/001009]:	_Ibid_.

Punwani then reports what happened in the court:

>Some
of the first 15 accused have stated in court, when their remand
was being asked for, that they were picked up from their homes
or workplaces. The office record of Inayat Jhujhara (57), a
government servant and one of the accused, shows him to
have been at work on the morning of February 27 from 9 am
to 12.30 pm. This means, according to the police, he burnt
the coach early in the morning and then went to work.
Jhujhara, due to retire soon, was suspended from his job on
March 15.[^/0010010]

[^/0010010]:	_Ibid_.

This also does not make much sense. Punwani
further reveals that according to Godhra's senior police officers
the combing operations began only on the evening of February
27, after the chief minister visited Godhra. If the case papers
of this crucial offence are so full of loopholes, it is hardly
surprising that those of CR 66/2002, relating to the violence
which took place in the town after the Sabarmati Express
incident, are even more questionable. Punwani probes the
matter further and discloses:

>The most important anomaly here is that the four main
accused in this offence are the same four persons accused of
burning the bogie of the Sabarmati Express: President of the
Godhra Municipality Abdul Rahim Kalota, and corporators
Haji Bilal, Salim Shaikh and Abdul Rahman Dhantiya alias
Kaankatta. This offence covers four different incidents of
rioting and of damage done in four different areas. But only
Muslim properties were damaged and burnt. This means,
according to the police, after leading the mob which burnt
the train, Kalota, Bilal and Co went on to lead four mobs
which fought the Hindus at one spot, and damaged properties
belonging to their own community in three different areas of
Godhra. These three are all Hindu areas, in which showrooms
and shops owned by Muslims, a mosque and a Muslim school,
were damaged and burnt. In this CR, Farooqbhai Kasimani,
whose shop and godown were looted and burnt, has been
made an accused in an offence regarding the looting of his
own shop![^/0010011]

[^/0010011]:	_Ibid_.

Punwani's meticulous report, which is based on
minute details, shows that there was no seriousness on the
part of the police while handling such a terrible affair, what
shook not only the whole of Gujarat but also India. Had it
been handled more competently and with utmost urgency it
might have changed the course of events in Gujarat, which
brought such bad name to the administration.

Praful Bidwai, the noted columnist, wrote in Frontline:

>Reconstruction of the Godhra incident, for example in the
Citizens' Forum report, suggests that it was a spontaneous,
rather than an elaborately planned, over-reaction to the daily
harassment of local Ghanchi Muslims (oil-pressers by
occupation) by communally charged kar sevaks returning from
Ayodhya. Had there been serious preparation for the attack
on the Sabarmati Express, scheduled to reach Godhra at 2.55
a.m. there would have been a large crowd on the railway
platform at dawn. There was not. When the train rolled in
five hours late, there were only a handful of vendors, porters
and passengers on the platform. An altercation broke out
between the kar sevaks and Muslim tea vendors. It was only
when a rumour spread that young Sophia Khan had been
dragged into coach S-6 that a crowd gathered near Signal Falia,
a _basti_ known for communal tension and criminal activities.
Seven weeks on, the government has failed to provide credible
evidence linking the Godhra episode to a 'conspiracy' involving
Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence or even an organized
group in Gujarat or elsewhere. Nor can it explain why towns
such as Ratlam, which are physically far closer to Godhra, and
which have a similar composition of Hindus, Muslims and
_Adivasis_, did not register any 'retaliatory' violence, while
distant Ahmedabad did.[^/0010012]

[^/0010012]:	_Frontline_, May 10, 2002.

Vir Sanghvi, the young and erudite editor of _Hindustan
Times_ is scathing in his attack on the secularists, especially in
the media, who are fond of blaming the Hindus and exonerating
the Muslims, even if the latter are the guilty ones. He wrote:

>Even if you dispute the version of some of the kar sevaks ---
that the attack was premeditated and that the mob was ready
and waiting --- there can be no denying that what happened
was indefensible, unforgivable and impossible to explain away
as a consequence of great provocation. And yet, this is precisely
how the secular establishment has reacted ... This time,
however, there has been no real provocation at all ... And
yet, the sub-text to all secular commentary is the same: the kar
sevaks had it coming to them. Basically, they condemn the
crime; but blame the victims. Try and take the incident out of
the secular construct that we, in India, have perfected and see
how bizarre such an attitude sounds in other contexts ... Why
then are these poor kar sevaks an exception? Why have we
de-humanized them to the extent that we don't even see the
incident as the human tragedy that it undoubtedly was and
treat it as just another consequence of the VHP's fundamentalist
policies? The answer, I suspect, is that we are programmed to
see Hindu--Muslim relations in simplistic terms: Hindus
provoke, Muslims suffer.[^/0010013]

Too many questions have been raised by several important
citizens anxious to know the truth but until now there has
been no coherent and satisfactory answers; rumours still float
and these are causing all the damage to the stability and security
of the state. Moreover as the reaction to the Godhra incident
throughout Gujarat was almost spontaneous and sudden, it
took a much more savage form with the result that the torching
of the men, women and children in Godhra was sidetracked.
And as the victims in Gujarat were Muslims while in Godhra
they were Hindus, a nasty communal colour was given by
certain interested parties to their respective suffering as if
Hindu lives were less precious than Muslim lives or vice versa.
A most odious and unfortunate comparison which did
enormous damage to communal harmony; it distorted the sense
of horror, at both the happenings; each should have been
simultaneously condemned and the suffering of the victims
equally mourned, irrespective of the number, the degree or
the enormity of the crime.

Four months after the incident the Gujarat Forensic
Science Laboratory has submitted its report; but it has taken
the matter no further, even after some MPs asked the
Government for the truth. In fact the report has given rise
once again to several contradictory versions, with the result
that it has almost opened a Pandora's box. Shankersinh
Vaghela, the former Chief Minister of Gujarat, finds in the
report enough proof that the burning of coach S-6 of the
Sabarmati Express was done by the miscreants of the VHP to
fuel the fire of massacre of the Muslims throughout Gujarat;
but the other side feels that the report provides enough material
to show that it was a planned operation by some of the Muslim
fanatics who were supported by the local population. _Frontline_,
the influential fortnightly of the Hindu group of newspapers,
after analyzing the evidence as produced by the Gujarat
Forensic Science Laboratory has stated:

>Regardless of what methods are used, how much evidence
is gathered or how quickly the investigation is wrapped up,
whether the truth about the burning of the Sabarmati Express
will ever be known is another story. Powerful Hindutva leaders
had already written the script on the day of the tragedy itself.[^/0010014]

[^/0010014]:	_Frontline_, August 2, 2002.

Mohan Guruswamy goes to the extent of observing in The
Asian Age that

>File photographs of the burning coach very
clearly show the flames raging from within, without even the
external paintwork being touched. The pictures also show
rescuers trying to hose down the flames standing right alongside
the burning coach. Obviously the coach was set afire from
within and whosoever still insists that it was set afire from
outside by the incensed mob is lying through the teeth.[^/0010015]

Only
the courts can decide who did what; until then speculation
continues to hold the fort with charges and counter charges
flung against one another.

Our popular and highly respected weekly, _India Today_
summed up realistically the so-called "action and reaction"
phenomenon proclaimed by the Chief Minister of Gujarat thus:

>First it was Godhra Junction, for so long a railway station
inconspicuous, ordinary, dirty, and then one extraordinary
morning, one compartment of the Sabarmati Express became
a moving inferno, and in the iron cage flesh and metal burned,
and the religion of the 57 dead was Hindu. A few hours later,
in distant Ahmedabad, fury, armed and hungry, the now
famous reaction, rode on the wings of fire, and the religion of
which was Hindu, and the killed and orphaned, in hundreds,
were Muslims, and the burned shops and houses were the
Muslims'. Both Godhra and Ahmedabad have travelled
quite a distance in death and remembrance since then.

And it has resulted, to quote the journal, in Muslims
languishing "in the ghettos of fear as the unrepentant Hindu
invents new phantoms."[^/0010016]
