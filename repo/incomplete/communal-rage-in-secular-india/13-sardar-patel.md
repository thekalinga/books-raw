# Sardar Patel

Apart from Shivaji _Maharaj_ and Swami Vivekananda,
the Hindu communalists swear by Sardar Vallabhbhai
Patel and propagate among their people that not Gandhi but
the Sardar was the real liberator of India, particularly of Hindus.
The Muslims have been made to believe that he was their
enemy who wanted to subjugate them. This was said even
during the freedom struggle with the result that the Mahatma
had to publicly contradict it. He said,

>It would be a travesty
of truth to describe the Sardar as being anti-Muslim. His heart
is so exhaustive that it can accommodate all.

I was shocked
to learn that a staunch disciple of Gandhiji was misrepresented
like this. He was not only a firm believer in the Mahatma's
philosophy of non-violence but also a strong upholder of his
mission of Hindu--Muslim unity.

Some years ago All-India Radio asked me to deliver their
prestigious Sardar Patel Memorial Lectures. I chose the subject:
Sardar Patel and Indian Muslims. I made a special study of his
life and career to understand his approach to Hindu--Muslim
relations. I divided the subject in two parts. The first lecture
dealt with the Sardar's attitude to Indian Muslims before Partition
and the second on his role after Partition. Both the lectures
were later published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in a book
and had a wonderful response. They have also been translated
into several languages. The Urdu edition contains an
appreciative foreword by the distinguished poet Ali Sardar Jafri.

I had the privilege of meeting the Sardar only once; it
happened some time after my return from London, where I
had lived for five years (1944 to 1948) for my post-graduate
work. Those were turbulent days; apart from my studies, I was
actively involved in the India League of V.K. Krishna Menon
and in the premier organization of Indian students, known as
the Federation of Indian Students' Societies in Great Britain
and Europe of which I was then the Chairman. Almost a year
after my return from London, I received a letter from V.Y. Tonpe,
private secretary to the then Home Minister of Bombay,
Morarji Desai informing me that India's Deputy Prime Minister
would be pleased to see me at Birla House, Bombay. The date
was May 19, 1950 and the time given was 10 a.m. I was alone
with the Sardar for more than an hour; he was lying in bed as
he was not in the best of health. He discussed with me the
Hindu--Muslim problem, in particular the attitude of the
younger Muslim generation. He listened patiently to my
apprehensions and then asked me to impress upon my young
co-religionists the need to get rid of the barriers that Jinnah
and the Muslim League had built in dividing the two
communities. He was worried about the impact on the Muslims
of the Two-Nation theory that had caused Partition. His advice
to me was to activitise them in a way that they would be
inspired by the same spirit that prevailed during the Khilafat
movement in the twenties; this spirit, unfortunately, had been
replaced by "suspicion, ill-will and hostility". He asked me to
work for creating "mutual trust between Hindus and Muslims
which alone could ensure them peace and prosperity".
The goodwill of the majority, he said, "was the best safeguard
for a minority". I expected that he would be aggressive
and even angry against the Muslims for their part in
Partition but he was not only surprisingly calm but almost
patronizing and without the least rancour. His words had a
deep impact on me; I came back more hopeful about the
future of Indian Muslims.

During the freedom struggle no one ever accused him of
any kind of communal bias. Politically he treated Hindus and
Muslims alike, though socially he felt more at ease with the
Hindus. But after the rise of the Muslim League under the
leadership of Jinnah, in 1937, his attitude changed. He began
to doubt the _bonafides_ of the Muslims; he felt they had little
interest in uniting with the Hindus. In the result, his attitude
towards them hardened, especially during the forties. The
struggle for Pakistan and its eventual creation made him bitter
against them. Some of his own colleagues accused him of being
a communalist; among them were Maulana Azad and
Jayaprakash Narayan. Even Rajaji wrote in _Swarajya_:

>A myth
had grown about Patel that he would be harsh towards Muslims.
This was a wrong notion but it was the prevailing prejudice.[^/0010001]

[^/0010001]:	_Swarajya_, November 27, 1971.

Take the early years of his public life, when the Sardar was
the master of Gujarat. Did he show any trace of prejudice
against the Muslims? The litmus test came, when Gandhiji
decided to collaborate with the Ali Brothers --- Maulana
Shaukat Ali and Maulana Mohamed Ali, on the question of,
what then came to be known as the Khilafat wrong. It was
the betrayal by the British of the promise given by their Prime
Minister Lloyd George to the Indian Muslims that their holiest
places in Mecca and Medina, including the Kaaba, would not
be taken away from the Ottoman Khalifa, who was then their
custodian, on the defeat of Turkey in World War I (1914--18).
That promise was not kept and the Muslims became
apprehensive that the Kaaba would be desecrated or handed
over to an agent of the British. The Muslim world, particularly
south and central Asia, seethed with resentment.

The Ali Brothers took the lead in organizing protests by
Indian Muslims. Gandhiji felt that the Hindus should join
the Muslims in their hour of need; most Congress leaders
disagreed with him. They felt that Khilafat, being a religious
issue, should not be mixed with politics. The Mahatma took
a different view. He said that the Hindus should not remain
aloof from the Muslims on an issue which had so grievously
hurt them. Being a deeply religious man, he respected the
religious feelings of others. These transcended political
considerations. He insisted, therefore, that the Hindus should
stand by the Muslims in their fight against the British. The
Congress vacillated; but the Mahatma stuck to his stand. The
Muslims took him to their hearts and offered to follow his
lead. That was how the first massive non-cooperation
movement against the British was launched from the historic
Khilafat House in Bombay on August 1, 1920, the day Tilak
died. It received tremendous popular support; the Raj was
shaken. Of all his disciples it was Patel who instinctively
followed the Mahatma; in fact he became the torch-bearer of
the movement. For two decades, through various phases of
the freedom struggle, the Sardar remained steadfast in his loyalty
to Gandhiji and his mission of Hindu--Muslim unity.

However, there was a sea change in his attitude when
Jinnah propagated his Two-Nation theory and demanded a
separate homeland for the Muslims. The response of the
Muslims to Jinnah upset the Sardar. His growing popularity
among them disheartened him. It brought about a rapid
transformation in his approach towards them. He openly
accused them of damaging the fabric of communal harmony
which Gandhiji had so assiduously built. The subsequent
events, leading to Partition, confirmed in him this conviction.
Patel believed in the rough and tumble of politics;
constitutional niceties bored him; prolonged negotiations with
the Muslim League irritated him. Jinnah's constant attacks on
the Congress, describing it as a fascist Hindu organization, and
his emphasis on Hindu--Muslim differences in every walk of
their lives, infuriated him. Further, Jinnah's tactics shocked
him. He could not understand how Maulana Azad, so deeply
steeped in Islam, was unable to counter the influence of a
man who was not even a practising Muslim and who openly
defied the canons and rituals of his religion. And how the
Muslims followed Jinnah instead of Azad who was respected
throughout the Muslim world. This upset him deeply.

Nevertheless, there was no hatred against them in his heart;
this became evident when Hindu--Muslim riots broke out in
Ahmedabad. He was then languishing in Yervada jail. The
news came as a personal blow to him. On enquiry he was told
that these riots were deliberately engineered by some British
officers. He felt that his own city, where he had worked so
hard for communal harmony should have been immune to
such machinations. He wrote in a mood of grave depression
to Mahadev Desai on May 11, 1941:

>I cannot understand
how it has come about that our people have been so
unnerved ... The only reason, it seems to me, why the ordinary
people have lost their nerve is that our own workers seemed
to have cared for their own protection. You will have received
full details of what took place. We cannot of course alter what
has already happened and it is no use crying over spilt milk.
But we must think of the future and find out the solution. We
will have to pass through very difficult times hereafter, and it
would be foolish on our part to look for help from a Government
whom we are fighting. I have no doubt you will have given
thought to this matter. Things have not yet settled down in
Bombay. I hope things have quietened down in Patna. It seems
as if there has been a veritable epidemic of communal riots. That
which we were afraid of has happened. God's will will be done.[^/0010002]

[^/0010002]:	Parikh, Narhari D., _Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel_, Vol.II, p. 445.

On his release, he told the thousands of workers gathered
at the Congress House at Ahmedabad:

>The wounds that
were inflicted on me, deep down within me, when I heard of
what took place during the riots in this city, have still not
been healed. I have not been able to reconcile to it as yet.
What possessed you so suddenly that you started cutting each
other's throats? Some hundred innocent men died for no
reason. If even ten had been bold enough to stand up to the
miscreants, this would not have happened. I must tell you
that Gandhiji was deeply hurt, for Ahmedabad had made him
look foolish. You then approached the Government and asked
for enquiry! ... In future do not ever run away. Put up the
defence. The whole world is doing that. If you can, face your
enemy with a superior force, i.e. Gandhiji's path of nonviolence.
Whether you are a Hindu or a Muslim, stand up
and face your enemy, but do not seek to excuse your
cowardliness on the ground of non-violence. During these
riots there was no sign of non-violence. We have made nonviolence
an excuse for our cowardice.[^/0010003]

[^/0010003]:	_Ibid_., pp. 445--446.

Though Azad had differences with Patel, just before his
death in 1958, he told his collaborator, Humayun Kabir, as
reported in The Statesman, that he should have proposed Patel as
the Congress President in 1946 instead of Nehru who was Azad's
closest friend. Had he done so, Azad confided in Kabir, the
Mahatma would have later made the Sardar, the Prime Minister.
Patel, Azad felt, would have done a better job of it than Nehru.

During the British Cabinet Mission's stay in Delhi, Jinnah
requested the Aga Khan to be a mediator between him and
Patel. The Aga Khan readily agreed and used all his charm,
eloquence and influence to persuade the Sardar to meet Jinnah
but the Sardar refused. He told the Aga Khan that Jinnah
had, all along, abused the Congress and the Hindus "in season
and out of season"; he always played the game of hide and
seek to avoid a settlement. The Aga Khan said that Jinnah
had changed; he was "now in a better frame of mind." "Does
a scorpion ever change its colour", Patel asked.

At first many in the Congress were against the acceptance
of the Cabinet Mission's Plan; they did not like the three-tier
legislative pattern grouping the provinces into three subfederations,
one consisting of the Hindu-majority group and
the other two, the Muslim-majority groups; but later, after
further discussions with the Viceroy Lord Wavell and the
members of the Cabinet Mission, Patel was converted and he
was able to dispel the misgivings of the members of the Congress
Working Committee about it. He persuaded them to accept
the Plan in the larger interest of the unity of India. Azad quickly
conveyed the decision to the Viceroy. The main opposition
had come from the Hindus in Assam, who were grouped with
the Muslim-majority province of Bengal. But grouping was an
integral part of the Plan which made the League accept it.
The Sardar realized this and so urged its opponents to be
reasonable. In a letter dated June 12, 1946 to one of them he
wrote:

>I do not think it is wise to open up these matters
(compulsory grouping and para 19 of the Plan) at this stage.
If we find the Plan otherwise satisfactory and the interim
arrangement, which is a part of it, is made to our satisfaction,
it would be wise to accept the proposals.[^/0010004]

Rajaji, who was
all for the acceptance of the Plan, revealed that it was because
of the "firm and thoughtful stand" of the Sardar that the
Congress accepted it. As soon as Jinnah heard of the decision
of the Congress, he conveyed the League's acceptance to
the Viceroy.

[^/0010004]:	Das, Durga (ed.), _Sardar Patel's Correspondence 1945--50_, p. 108.

The development naturally roused both joy and hope in
political circles; every one felt that at long last the unity of
India was saved; but then something happened, which,
according to Azad, "reversed the course of history". Nehru
had by then replaced Azad as the Congress President, and
at his first press conference at Bombay on July 10, 1946 after
assuming the new position, Nehru declared that the Congress
would enter the Constituent Assembly "completely unfettered"
and would be free to change or modify the Cabinet Mission's
Plan. He explained that there was every possibility that the
two groups, which would have the Muslim majority, would
"decide against grouping." He went still further and added,
"In betting language there is a four-to-one chance of the NorthWest
Frontier deciding against grouping in the north-west and
Assam in the north-east." This meant that the sub-federations
consisting of the Muslim majority groups, would not come into
existence because Assam, with its Hindu majority and the
N.W.F., with its Muslim majority would not join it. This
torpedoed the whole Plan, so laboriously put forth by the
Cabinet Mission and unanimously accepted by both the
Congress and the League.

Jinnah reacted instantly; he withdrew the League's
acceptance of the Plan, saying that the Congress President
had repudiated its very basis. The Sardar was downcast; in a
sharp letter to his friend D.P. Mishra on July 29, 1946 he
wrote:

>Though the president (Nehru) has been elected for
the fourth time, he often acts with child-like innocence which
puts us all in great difficulties unexpectedly. You have good
reason to be angry but we must not allow our anger to get the
better of ourselves ... He has done many things recently which
have caused us great embarrassment ... his press conference
immediately after the AICC are all acts of emotional insanity
and it puts tremendous strain on us to set matters right. His
mind has been exhausted by overwork and strain. He feels
lonely and he acts emotionally and we have to bear the
circumstances. Opposition sometimes drives him mad as he is
impractical.[^/0010005]

Gandhiji agreed with the Sardar. He was then
resting at Panchgani in Maharashtra and told Jayaprakash
Narayan that Nehru's "rash statement had dashed all hopes of
settlement on the basis of undivided India". The result was
Partition which both Nehru and Patel eventually accepted
much against the wishes of Gandhiji; it was the biggest blunder
that the Congress committed; Nehru first gave in and later
Patel felt compelled to do so. However both regretted their
decision soon thereafter but unfortunately the die was cast.
Partition brought disaster after disaster; its aftermath was so
horrendous that civil war would have been a far better solution.
By creating Pakistan, India put her own security and stability
in permanent danger.

[^/0010005]:	_Ibid_., pp. 153--154.

The Sardar was no less miserable than Gandhiji at the
brutal and inhuman happenings in the wake of Partition; at
first he had felt that it was best to cut off a diseased limb; but
subsequently he realized that in the process the body itself
had got permanently deformed. Even before the healing
started, cases of loot, arson, rape and murder shocked him. He
had never realized that the consequences would be so terrible;
He admitted woefully, rather too late, that the cure had proved
worse than the disease. He said in a statement to the press on
August 8, 1947:

>You cannot divide the sea or the waters of
the river. As for the Muslims they have their roots, their sacred
places and their centres here. I do not know what they can
possibly do in Pakistan. It will not be long before they return
to us.[^/0010006]

[^/0010006]:	Seervai, H.M., _Partition of India --- Legend and Reality_, p. 134.

That proved to be wishful thinking.
After Partition, when the Sardar became the Deputy Prime
Minister, holding the portfolio of Home he spared no one,
Hindu, Sikh or Muslim, who indulged in any kind of wrong
doing. He did everything in his power to provide as much to
the helpless Muslims as to Hindu and Sikh refugees. He
appointed a Muslim as the Inspector General of Special Police
Force; and another Muslim as the first Chief Commissioner of
Delhi. He asked the Hindu and Sikh refugees not to cause any
trouble to the Muslims. He reminded them that "there are 70
million Muslims in India; it is our business to see that they are
safe and free". He deprecated the Two-Nation theory and
declared "our problem number one is to disprove Jinnah and
his teachings".[^/0010007] He added:

>Butchery of innocent and
defenceless men, women and children does not behove brave
men; it is the war of the jungle and the hallmark of inhumanity
and barbarity. There will be occasions and opportunities for
all of you to show your zest for fight; one must seek for it on
one's ground and suitable time. It is no time to be foolhardy
or desperate but time to reflect calmly on your course of action.
We have won our freedom to make our country great and
prosperous, not to destroy what little has been vouchsafed to
us by our alien rulers.

He concluded by reminding them
that the lives of millions were at stake; these could not be
thrown away to satisfy the spirit of vengeance or retaliation.
He appealed to them to maintain peace and "break the
vicious circle of attack and counter-attack, retaliation and
counter-retaliation."[^/0010008]

There was constant pressure on Patel to declare India a
Hindu state especially as Pakistan had become a Muslim state.
He told B.M.Birla who had strongly advocated such a step:

>I
do not think it will be possible to consider India as a Hindu
state with Hinduism as a state religion. We must not forget
that there are other minorities whose protection is our primary
responsibility.[^/0010009]

Numerous instances have been recorded by
senior civil and police officers about the Sardar taking them to
task in case of failure on their part to protect the poor and
innocent Muslims, targeted by Hindu fanatics. V. Shankar
has narrated how the Sardar rushed out one night to save the
Dargah of Nizamuddin Auliya in South Delhi which was taken
over by some Hindu miscreants; on hearing of it, Patel wrapped
his shawl around his shoulders and told his Private Secretary:
"Let us go to the saint, before we incur his displeasure."[^/00100010] Similar
heart-rendering accounts to save Muslims in distress have been
recorded by K.B.Lal, H.M.Patel and other high ranking I.C.S.
officers who worked under Patel during those critical times.
He castigated the Muslims for partitioning India but did not
spare the Hindus for unnecessarily harassing and persecuting
them. There is also the testimony of no less an antagonist of
the Sardar than Choudhary Khaliquzzaman who records in
his book Pathway to Pakistan about the firmness with
which Patel saved the besieged Muslims in Delhi. He appealed
to the Hindus to give up their distrust of the Muslims.
He said:

>If you think you can go on constantly troubling
loyal Muslims because they happen to be Muslims, then our
freedom is not worthwhile.[^/00100011]

As Minister of Information and Broadcasting, the portfolio
which he held simultaneously with Home, the Sardar had to
deal with the problem of Urdu; He wrote in a note:

>As
regards Urdu, I am doubtful of either the propriety or the
wisdom of relegating it entirely to the regional domain. In a
sense, Urdu like Hindi, cannot belong to one region. Those
who speak and understand this language are not concentrated
in one geographical area. To this extent, Urdu differs from
other regional languages. You cannot confine it to any one
particular region though you can say that it is mainly spoken
in a large portion of Northern India.[^/00100012]

He asked his officers,
therefore, to include Urdu as one of the main languages of
AIR stations in some provinces and added:

>I feel that, if we
have to make AIR effective as an instrument of publicity and
promotion of ideals of a secular state and culture amongst a
large majority of Muslims and refugees, we must, for the time
being, assign a portion of our AIR programme from Delhi (at
national level) to Urdu.[^/00100013]

According to S.Gopal, whose threevolume
biography of Nehru has become a classic, and who is
quite critical of the Sardar,

>Patel is usually depicted as a
supporter of Hindu chauvinism, but actually his major concern
was national unity.[^/00100014]

Gopal has even observed that Prasad
was more non-secular than Patel.

Presenting the unanimous report of the committee on
minorities as its Chairman to the Constituent Assembly, the
Sardar reminded the Hindus that the minorities had entrusted
them with a sacred trust when they so willingly agreed to give
up Separate Electorate; the Hindus, therefore, should give them
through general electorate their due representation. He
warned them: "that a discontented minority is a burden and a
danger and that we must not do anything to injure the feelings
of any minority so long as it is not unreasonable." He said:
"It is upto the majority community, by its generosity, to create
a sense of confidence in the minorities."[^/00100015] Turning towards
the Hindu members, he told them:

It is for us who happen to
be in a majority to think about what the minorities feel and
imagine; how we would feel if we were treated in the manner
in which they are treated.[^/00100016]

[^/00100016]:	_Ibid_.

The Sardar was not opposed to the preservation of the
identities of the Muslims and other minorities; on the contrary
on three matters which were of supreme importance to them,
he took a firm stand, despite the pressure of many Hindu
leaders. These were: (1) the right to propagate their religion;
(2) the right to preserve their language, script and culture;
and (3) the right to run their educational institutions. As the
Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Minorities and
Fundamental Rights, these came directly under him. Much
heat was generated among the members, in particular on giving
the right to non-Hindus to proselytize. Christian and Muslim
members were adamant on it; they said it was a vital part of
their religion. The Hindus, on the other hand, were dead
against it. They pointed out that even the 1931 Karachi
Session of the Congress, over which the Sardar himself had
presided, had only guaranteed to a citizen "the right freely to
profess and practise his religion" and not "to propagate it".
K.M. Munshi and Purushottam Das Tandon, both closest to
the Sardar, argued vehemently against the incorporation of
the word, 'propagate'; this would, they said, open-the floodgate
of conversion by various kinds of inducements. Tandon
said that it was "very improper to convert from one religion to
another" and totally wrong to allow it. The Christian and
Muslim members emphasised that "propagation" was an article
of faith with them.

As was his practice, the Sardar listened patiently to
members on both the sides; but expressed no opinion.
Meanwhile a delegation of some of the leading members of
the minorities met Nehru and pleaded for their right to
propagate their religion. Nehru was sympathetic but told them
frankly that he did not believe in organized religion and so he
was unable to appreciate its propagation. But this was, he
said, his personal view; they should discuss it with Patel who
would be more appreciative of their sentiments and do the
needful. The Sardar heard them with patience when they
saw him next. He was amused at what Nehru had told them.
He assured them, however, that he would do whatever he
could to help them out. Thus, despite strong opposition from
the Hindu members, he exerted all his prestige and influence
to get the word "propagate" incorporated in the relevant
Article (25) of the Constitution.

Likewise it was because of the Sardar's persuasion, that
the Constituent Assembly passed articles (29) and (30) which
have guaranteed to the minorities, the right to conserve their
"distinct language, script and culture" and "to establish and
administer educational institutions of their choice." These
constitute the arsenal of their rights as enshrined in Chapter
III of the Constitution which is enforceable by the courts. It is
a pity that this remarkable contribution of the Sardar to the
strengthening of secularism in India has not been properly
appreciated; had he not put all his weight behind their
incorporation, the minorities might not have been given the
right to maintain their identity in India.

In the last year of his life, Patel gave yet another proof that
he was not anti-Muslim; this was in the case of Justice Bashir
Ahmed of the Madras High Court whom the Government of
India had proposed as a permanent judge of the Madras High
Court. Chief Justice Kania of the Supreme Court of India
negated the proposal. Patel instructed Home Secretary H.V.R.
Iyengar to go ahead with the appointment disregarding Kania's
objection. He told Kania on the telephone that any rejection
of Justice Bashir Ahmed at this stage could reasonably be
regarded as arising "out of prejudice against the Muslims".
It would be unwise to give such an impression, he added.

Patel was, however, not much enamoured of the concept
of secularism; he used the word rarely; its western connotation,
which downgraded religion, was not much to his liking.
Though not a deeply religious man, he was proud of his Hindu
heritage. But like his master, his Hinduism was not narrow;
he respected other religions and had no quarrel with the
nation's composite character. But it had to harmonize with
the mainstream; the minorities had to so adjust themselves as
to be an integral part of it. He could not understand their fear
that in the process, their identity might suffer. He was totally
opposed to the establishment of a Hindu rashtra; whenever
anyone talked about it, he brushed it aside by saying that it
could never work. He was sure that this country, in the
remoulding of which the Sardar played such a vital part, would
never subscribe to it. In his unforgettable words: "It will kill
the soul of India."

Tough, determined, uncompromising and even unforgiving
at times, the Sardar was never vengeful; nor did he entertain
hatred or prejudice against anyone. In the words of
Wordsworth:

>In him the savage virtue of the race,
>
>Revenge and ferocious thoughts were dead;
>
>Nor did he change; but kept in lofty place
>
>The wisdom which adversity had bred.
