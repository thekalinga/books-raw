he scorching in Godhra and the subsequent carnage in
some areas in Gujarat was undoubtedly the work of the
fanatical elements of both the communities; the _jihadis_
supported the Ghanchis in Godhra and the communal Hindus
whose religious frenzy was whipped up against the Muslims in
Gujarat were with the Hindu goons who perpetrated the
genocide. But the danger to the future of our polity comes
more from the indoctrination of young Hindus who have been
told to hate Muslims. Their rage is alarming. The Muslim
fanatics destroy lives but the Hindu fanatics have the power
to damage the democratic and secular base of our Republic.

One of our greatest political scientists, Rajni Kothari who
known for his sober analysis of political developments, has
warned in an article in _Hindustan Times_ that,

>the spread of
communal riots in Gujarat was not going to be confined to
that state only or contained within it.

He explained:

>For the
reality is that what has started in Gujarat is a phenomenon
that has nationwide implications; indeed international
implications as well ... In fact, the global reaction is not limited
to countries owing loyalty to Islam as was recently found in
the highly troubled responses of the EU and various countries
that have on the whole been well disposed to India. They all
see in the attack on Muslims in India, an issue which can no
longer be called an 'internal matter' but has large global
implications both in respect of human rights and the growth
of a dangerous ideology. They all point to the grave danger of
large-scale 'ethnic cleansing', which could well endanger the
lives of thousands, if not millions of people.

Kothari drew attention to the fact that human rights
advocates saw the growth of a dangerous onslaught against not
just one community but the whole secular and democratic ethos
of the country. He added:

>This has been further accentuated
by the consequences in India which cut across national
boundaries and can be used by Pakistan in which the threat to
'Muslims' can be highlighted ... The result is a dangerous
polarization which goes far beyond Gujarat and could take on a
national character. The fact that highly educated Muslims living
in cosmopolitan societies are beginning to feel that the attack is
aimed at them, could well oust them from their present habitats
and shake their confidence in a pluralistic India --- thereby
pushing them to a dangerous communal space.

Kothari therefore warns:

>The more such a divide engulf
the social fabric, the more one is up against the startling
conclusion that while the Sangh parivar swears by nationalism,
it is really the pernicious Two-Nation theory that it subscribes
to ... Once this happens there will be no room for genuinely
secular forces who would fight and struggle for democratic and
secular values and ideologies ... [^/004001]

Amulya Ganguli has been more forthright in his assessment
of the danger that India faces; he has expressed his
apprehensions more specifically:

>It is salutary to remember
that immediately after securing an absolute majority in Gujarat,
the saffron camp went quickly to work to exacerbate communal
tension. At that time, its target was the Christian community.
But the elaborate paraphernalia of a free society --- the
judiciary, human rights and minority commissions, the media,
NGOs, etc. --- ensured that the fire did not burn out of control.
During the latest outbreak, the ruling party again acted exactly
as a fascist outfit would --- issue orders 'restraining' the police
and not the rioters, punish those officials who acted impartially,
discriminate in the matter of providing relief, etc. In addition,
by appointing a retired judge to probe the riots whose
impartiality is under a cloud.[^/004002]

[^/004002]:	_Ibid_., April 22, 2002.

Arjun Sengupta, the eminent economist, in a thoughtprovoking
contribution to a national daily, has after analysing
the horror of the torching of the kar sevaks --- men, women
and children and the holocaust that followed, asked the
question:

>The time has come to analyse what has gone wrong.
Why did we not see the writing on the wall? Why were we ali
lulled into silence and inaction, hoping somehow the spectre
that is haunting India will go away?

He then describes the
spectre as

>one of rising fascism, taking the garb of religious revival
or Hindutva. Fascism had wrecked Europe through war and
destruction, pogroms and the holocaust, throwing up leaders
like Mussolini and Hitler, Salazar and Franco and many smaller
leaders heading bands of youths and volunteers, almost like the
RSS and VHP cadres in India. The analogy does not end there.
A look at history will bring out clearly how the Hindutva brigade
closely resembles the Red Shirts and Nazi brigades.[^/004003]

[^/004003]:	_Ibid_., April 23, 2002.

Sengupta
explains that there is no one model of fascism; it took on different
roles in different countries over different decades. But there is
one characteristic which is common to all: the method of their
capturing power and then exercising that power to achieve their
objective of imposing their brand of cultural domination. Once
they gained that power, they could not be dislodged. They rig
elections; they dismantle democratic institutions.

Eric Hobsbawm in his book: The Age of Extremes, A History
of the World, 1914--1991, stresses the similarities between the
rise and expansion of fascism in Europe and the Hindutva
movement of the last few years in India. He writes:

>Fascism
in Europe of all varieties was fundamentally conservative, antiliberal
and authoritarian. The major difference between the
fascist and the non-fascist Right was that fascism existed by
mobilizing masses from below ... Fascists were the
revolutionaries of counter-revolution. To mobilize these masses,
the fascists appealed to building up a consciousness of solidarity
among them, based on ultra-nationalism, glorifying traditional
and a distant past and a cult of hatred against a target group to
heighten their own sense of identify. Added to that was the
practice of street violence by an organized group of volunteers
subject to discipline and inspired by a cult of revenge. Ultranationalism
of the fascists was linked to hatred against the
foreigners and immigrants, which included in small localities,
immigrants from outside who were held to be responsible for
all the ills afflicting the people.

Glorified traditionalism has also found expression in "the
rhetoric of a return to the traditional past" and "the past to
which they appealed was an artefact. Their traditions were
invented". There was also the stress on "traditional values"
and "denunciation of liberal emancipation --- women should
stay at home and bear a great many children --- and they
distrusted the corroding influences of modern culture, especially
the modernist arts". The hatred for some target groups ---
mainly, but not exclusively, the Jews --- was the cementing
factor in that ideology which justified ethnic cleansing and
genocide in those countries. Sengupta comments:

>All these
sound so familiar in India. Concentrating on the Jews at that
time came in handy because of a rather long and persistent
anti-semitism in Europe. In our country it could be the Muslims
or even the Christians if public perception could be easily
swayed. The purpose would be to strengthen the identity and
solidarity of the other groups that excluded them, and also to
strike terror in the hearts of the target groups and of anybody
who could be seen as sympathetic or associated with them.

To Hobsbawm, fascism in 20th century Europe was "the
combination of conservative values, the techniques of mass
democracy and an innovative ideology of irrationalist savagery".
History repeats itself, warns Sengupta, though not exactly in
the same form but often with striking similarity of the process
of how things happen. He remarks:

>We may not end up with
a Mussolini or a Hitler, but we may witness the evolution of a
very similar process of history of growing fascism that could
end up with many little Mussolinis manipulating populism and
communal hatred. One lesson that the history of these sordid
years in Europe teaches us is that if the growth of fascism is not
resisted and fought at the very beginning, it inexorably engulfs
the whole society in a few years.[^/004004]

Arundhati Roy agreed with Arjun Sengupta and others
and mentioned specific apprehensions:

>Whipping up
communal hatred is part of the mandate of the Sangh parivar.
It has been planned for years. It has been injecting a slowrelease
poison directly into civil society's bloodstream.
Hundreds of RSS shakhas and Saraswati shishu mandirs across
the country have been indoctrinating thousands of children
and young people, stunting their minds with religious hatred
and falsified history. They're no different from, and no less
dangerous than, the madrasas all over Pakistan and
Afghanistan which spawned the Taliban. In states like Gujarat,
the police, the administration, and the political cadres at every
level have been systematically penetrated. It has huge popular
appeal, which it would be foolish to underestimate or
misunderstand. The whole enterprise has a formidable religious,
ideological, political, and administrative underpinning.
This kind of power, this kind of reach, can only be achieved
with State backing ...

She is equally apprehensive of the training, for instance,
that was being given in madrasas, the Muslim equivalent of
hothouses cultivating religious hatred, which had been funded
by foreign sources. According to her, they provide the perfect
foil for communal Hindus "to dance their dance of mass
paranoia and hatred". Disgusted with the current state of affairs,
Roy asks: "Why not dispense with the legal system, the
Constitution, the press --- the whole shebang --- morality itself,
why not chuck it and put everything up for a vote?" She mocks
at the way opinion polls were organized to test public opinion
about calamities. She would not be surprised if genocides
became the subject of opinion polls and receive popular
endorsement; or mass areas were used for promoting marketing
campaigns. She predicted in horror: "Fascism firm footprint
has appeared in India. Let's mark the date: Spring, 2002 ..."

Roy maintains that nationalism neatly dovetails into fascism
and has been "in all its many avatars - socialist, capitalist and
fascist ... at the root of almost all the genocides of the 20th
century." She further argues that

>the incipient, creeping fascism
of the past few years has been groomed by many of our
'democratic' institutions. Everyone has flirted with it ---
Parliament, the press, the police, the administration, and the
public. Even 'secularists' have been guilty of helping to create
the right climate. Each time you defend the right of an
institution, any institution (including the Supreme Court), to
exercise unfettered, unaccountable powers that must never
be challenged, you move towards fascism.

She adds:

>Fascism is also about the slow, steady infiltration
of all the instruments of state power. It's about the slow erosion
of civil liberties, about unspectacular day-to-day injustices ...
It means fighting to win back the minds and hearts of people ...
It means keeping an eagle eye on public institutions and
demanding accountability. It means putting your ear to the
ground and listening to the whispering of the truly powerless ...
These levels of rage and hatred cannot be contained, cannot
be expected to subside, with public censure and denunciation.
Hymns of brotherhood and love are great, but not enough ...

Arundhati blames every political party in India which

>has
tilled the marrow of our secular parliamentary democracy,
mining it for electoral advantage. Like termites excavating a
mound, they've made tunnels and underground passages,
undermining the meaning of 'secular', until it has just become
an empty shell that's about to implode. Their tilling has
weakened the foundations of the structure that connects the
Constitution, Parliament and the courts of law --- the
configuration of checks and balances that forms the backbone
of a parliamentary democracy.

Roy does not spare the people whom she holds no less
responsible for it; she says,

>it's futile to go on blaming politicians
and demanding from them a morality they're incapable of.
There's something pitiable about a people that constantly
bemoans its leaders. If they've let us down, it's only because
we've allowed them to. It could be argued that civil society
has failed its leaders as much as leaders have failed civil society ...
But politicians' exploitation of communal divides is by no
means the only reason that fascism has arrived on our shores ...
One hundred and thirty million Muslims live in India. Hindu
fascists regard them as legitimate prey.[^/004005]

[^/004005]:	_Outlook_, May 6, 2002.

Muslims have been the target of the communal Hindus
ever since the advent of the British; their scholars and
historians have dug chronicles of Middle Ages which were
written more to please the rulers than to record the facts and
were used to prejudice the Hindus against Islam and the
Muslims. The process was started during the time of the rule
of the East India Company and soon after Calcutta was chosen
as the first capital of the Raj. The Bengali babus eagerly
cherished whatever was dished out to them by the new masters;
Bengali literature bristles with hatred of Muslims which so
pleased the British that the babus became their favourites. In
a sense, the seeds of a fascist mindset were sown in India during
the earliest stage of the British rule.

M.J. Akbar in his much acclaimed seminal book: The Shade
of Swords points out how popular novelists of Bengal, from
Bankim Chandra Chatterji onwards drew their inspiration
from the hatred that they generated against "the raw brutes
like Muslims". He refers to Saratchandra Chattopadhyay, who
discussed the Bartaman Hindu-Mussalman Samasya (The
Present Hindu--Muslim Problem) in a speech to the Bengal
Provincial Conference in 1926; it was later printed in Hindu
Sangha. Its premise was that Hindu--Muslim unity, particularly
of the kind fostered by Mahatma Gandhi, was a dangerous
illusion, as 'battles for a false cause can never be won'. The
two communities had irreconcilable political aspirations,
Chattopadhyay said, and Muslims were hypocritical when they
sought the support of Hindus for their own ends.

>The truth is
that if Muslims ever say they want to unite with the Hindus,
there is no greater hoax. The Muslims came to India to plunder
it, not to establish a kingdom.

Akbar continues: "Facts were irrelevant to such analysis;
prejudice never too far away." He points out how the Hindus
believed that Muslims were not satisfied merely with looting,
they destroyed temples, they demolished idols, they raped
women. The insult to other religions and the injury to
humanity were unimaginable. Even when they became kings
they could not liberate themselves from these loathsome desires.
Such Hindus have not spared even emperor Akbar; they said
that he "was no better than notorious emperors like
Aurangzeb". In fact the Hindus were convinced that to the
Muslims "the destruction of temples was on par with rape of
women". Muslims would never attain the culture that Hindus
possessed; they were basically uncivilized.

M.J. reproduces the following quote from Saratchandra
Chattopadhyay:

>But if the essence of learning is width of the
mind and culture of the heart, then there is no comparison
between the two communities. ... Unity can only be realized
among equals. ... A thousand years has not been enough time,
nor will another millennium suffice. ...'Hindu--Muslim unity'
is a bombastic phrase ... We must sacrifice this illusion.

Akbar gives a graphic description of how Bengalis had
developed strong aversion to the Muslims; they were of the
opinion that the Muslims lacked culture. And therefore they
had become

>barbaric, brutal, fanatic, and rapist. There was
no difference between the poor and the rich Muslim, both
were barbaric, just as high culture was shared by all Hindus,
irrespective of their class or wealth.

The Bengali Hindus were
convinced that "cruelty was synonymous with Islam".
According to them all that "the passive Hindus do is to compile
lists of all instances of cruelty, oppressiveness and hostility
towards us" and all we ever say to the Muslims is this --- 'You
have killed us, you have broken our idols and kidnapped our
women. In this you have been very unjust and have caused us
great pain. We cannot continue to live like this. Do we ever
say more than this, or do more than this?' These Hindus ask
and boldly declare:

>Hindustan is the homeland of the Hindus.
Therefore it is the duty of the Hindus alone to free this nation
from the chains of servitude. Muslims look towards Turkey
and Arabia, their hearts are not in India.[^/004006]

[^/004006]:	Akbar, M.J., _The Shade of Swords --- _Jihad_ and the Conflict Between Islam and Christianity_, New Delhi, 2002, pp. 225--227.

The anti-Muslim trend in Bengali literature was strong and
widespread; it was successfully indoctrinated among the Hindus
by the British historians; later on it also impacted the writers
in other states like Maharashtra, U.P. and Bihar. They also
voiced the same sentiments against the Muslims. It was to some
extent countered by Ranade, Gandhi and Nehru, who wrote
eloquently on the benefits of the Muslim contribution to India.
In fact it was pioneered even earlier by Raja Ram Mohan Roy
and carried forward by the Tagores, father and son. The
outstanding exponents of communal harmony then were
Aurbindo Bose, Swami Vivekananda and the Nobel laureate
Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore sang of national integration so
melodiously that Hindu communalism, with its anti-Muslim
overtone was considerably diluted and even discarded in Bengal
thereafter; Tagore's poem "On the shores of Bharat" is the
best answer to the opponents of Hindu--Muslim unity:

>On the shores of Bharat,
>
>Where men of all races have come together,
>
>Awake, O my Mind!
>
>Standing here with outstretched arms,
>
>I send my salutations to the God of Humanity,
>
>And in solemn chant sing His praises.
>
>At whose call no one knows,
>
>Came floating streams of men
>
>And merged into the sea of Bharat.
>
>The Aryan, the non-Aryan, the Dravidian,
>
>The Huns, the Pathans and the Moghuls ---
>
>They all have merged here into one body.

Despite these efforts, the anti-Muslim sentiment did not
die; it continued to be fostered by the communal Hindus who
went on to rouse the rage in various ways against the Muslims.
It remained dormant during the freedom struggle when
communal harmony was the dominant theme; even after
Partition it could not be revived as forcefully as the communal
Hindus wanted because Nehru as Prime Minister managed to
thwart it. His successors in office were unable to keep up the
momentum; they tried to reinforce but failed to turn the Hindus
against going ahead on the anti-Muslim path; their influence
increased and its impact began to be felt far and wide. It has
now engulfed all shades of Hindus. The Hindu secularists are,
therefore, weary of its frightful consequences; they are afraid
that it might destroy the very basis of secular democracy.

Girish Mishra says: "Hindu communalism is an exercise in
social destructiveness on par with racism, fascism, Nazism,
religious fundamentalism and so on". The communal Hindu
does not think that his brand of communalism always implies
physical violence; but what is worse, it keeps the minorities
"intimidated and subdued through words, threats and certain
demonstrative actions". To maintain a regular hold on its
adherents, Hindu communalism "propagates its ideology,
through books, speeches, wall-writings". Its aim is to build up
the super psyche of the Hindus and downgrade that of the
Muslims who are shown as invaders, plunderers, murderers,
and rapists. To support their case, Hindu communalists give
comparative examples; they say while a Hindu reveres the cow,
a Muslim kills and eats it; while a Hindu worships idols, a
Muslim destroys them; while a Hindu faces the East for puja, a
Muslim prostrates towards the West when praying. Their aim
is to maintain the divide between the two religious groups so
that reconciliation is ruled out.

Girish Mishra elaborates its disastrous effect thus:

>Quite
often we meet individual Hindu communalists who appear to
be suave, soft-spoken, liberal and very amiable. On a personal
level, they may have excellent relations with their Muslim
neighbours but when they become part of a group, for example,
the VHP or Bajrang Dal, their behaviour undergoes a
metamorphosis and they become as intolerant and cruel as
their ideology demands. Thus communalism is a group
phenomenon in the sense that it reflects the attitude of one
group towards another.[^/004007]

When it is adopted by the majority
community then there is the danger that it can lead to fascism.

Nehru cautioned against this danger repeatedly in his speeches.
M.S. Golwalker, the ideologue of RSS, was an admirer of
Hitler's Germany. He wrote:

>German race pride has now
become the topic of the day. To keep up the purity of the race
and its culture, Germany shocked the world by purging the
country of the semitic race --- the Jews. Race pride at its highest
has been manifested here. Germany has also shown how wellnigh
impossible it is for races and cultures, having differences going
to the root, to be assimilated into one united whole, a good lesson
for us in Hindustan to learn and profit by.[^/004008]


[^/004008]:	Chandra, Bipin, _Communalism in Modern India_, New Delhi, 1984, pp. 354--355.

This was written before the outbreak of World War II
(1939--45) when the diabolical nature of the German Fuehrer
and his Nazi Germany was for the first time revealed to the
world. Until then many intellectuals and political leaders in
the West had eulogized Hitler for having transformed a defeated
and depressed people into a disciplined nation. They forgot to
notice that this was accomplished in a most ruthless manner,
singling out a particular race or community as the enemy and
exterminating it. Many Hindu intellectuals have now come
forward to warn the people that if the prevailing communal
rage is not checked, India may take to the fascist path; this
may not happen immediately but the signs do point in that
direction. They have pointed out that ethnic and economic
cleansing of Indian Muslims can never bring lasting prosperity
to the nation.

As Anita Pratap has expressed in her inimitable style:

>The
unalterable truth is that nowhere has fascism and ultranationalism
worked --- not in Germany, not in Italy, not in Sri
Lanka. Such misguided policies have wreaked havoc for
decades, bankrupting the nation and robbing the future of
entire generations of both the minority and majority
communities. That's the kind of history we don't want repeated
in India. Along the way, some of us may have lost our dreams.
But this is a nightmare worth fighting against.[^/004009]
