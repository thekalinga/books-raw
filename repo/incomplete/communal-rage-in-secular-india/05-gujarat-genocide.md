# Gujarat Genocide

There was an instant wave of fury unleashed by
certain Hindu communal elements as soon as the news
of the scorching of 58 kar sevaks in the Sabarmati Express at
Godhra was disseminated giving rise to an ugly mood of frenzied
revenge and retaliation; it took the most inhuman form of
violence and covered several cities and villages of Gujarat.
There was not only complete collapse of law and order but,
according to independent observers, it was aided and abetted
by police officers and ministers of the State Government and
even the elite which instantly resulted in the massacre of
innocent Muslims and the burning of women and children,
chopping a number of them into pieces, raping not only
young girls but also married women and widows. There was
also large scale destruction of property, including the razing of
hundreds of mosques and dargahs. The electronic media
showed the horrible scenes of brutality on the screen and
newspapers splashed the appalling happenings in sordid
detail on their front pages.

How could this have happened in Gujarat which used to
be moved by the songs of Narsingh Mehta? The question
disturbs the minds of several concerned Indians. In the moving
words of Shree Shankar Sharan, a social activist,

>Gujarat was
a land of peace, of growing prosperity of traders and migrants
to far-off lands, regardless of differences of faith and life-style,
of pioneers in science and technology, yet a culture rooted in
the indigenous tradition, the birthplace of Narsingh Mehta
who gave us the eternal and inspiring song "Vaishnav Jana
tau teney kahiye, je peer paraayi jaane re ..." which defined a
Hindu as one who empathizes with the pain of others. Yet
Gujarat exploded into an orgy of violence, brutality, mass
murder, bizarre violence against women and children from
February 27/28, 2002.[^/002001]

I am told that for over a decade the Hindus of Gujarat
have been systematically taught to hate Muslims and
exterminate them if possible. To kill them whenever an
opportunity came by or to boycott them socially and uproot
them economically. Arundhati Roy, internationally renowned
Booker Prize winner, who has been a doughty champion of
the oppressed and has shown unparalleled courage by
defying even the Supreme Court and suffering imprisonment
for contempt of court while standing up for what she considered
to be right, has given a devastating account of what the
Muslims in Gujarat had to face. In a long essay in _Outlook_,
she wrote:

>Within hours of the Godhra outrage, the Vishwa Hindu
Parishad (VHP) and the Bajrang Dal put into motion a
meticulously planned programme against the Muslim
community. Officially the number of dead is 800. Independent
reports put the figure at well over 2,000. More than a hundred
and fifty thousand people, driven from their homes, now live
in refugee camps. Women were stripped, gang-raped, parents
were bludgeoned to death in front of their children. Two
hundred and forty dargahs and 180 masjids were destroyed ---
in Ahmedabad the tomb of Wali Gujarati, the founder of
modern Urdu poetry was demolished and paved over in the
course of a night. The tomb of the musician Ustad Faiyaz Ali
Khan was desecrated and wreathed in burning tyres. Arsonists
burned and looted shops, homes, hotels, textiles mills, buses
and private cars. Hundreds of thousands have lost their jobs.[^/002002]

Mobs had been gathering at selected spots; Muslim houses
were marked; even high court judges were not spared; the
former MP Iqbal Ehsan Jafri was burnt alive. His telephone
calls to the Chief Secretary, the Police Commissioner and to
many others were not attended to. It was clear that the mobs
were meticulously organized; the operation was on a military
scale; they were armed with petrol bombs, guns, knives, swords
and tridents. Even the elite joined in the orgy; they had lists
of Muslim shops, establishments and businesses. To assist in
the murder and the loot, _Dalits_ and _Adivasis_ were brought
from far and near. According to Roy and many others, they
had mobile phones to coordinate the action. Trucks with
thousands of gas cylinders were loaded weeks in advance; they
were used to blow up Muslim commercial establishments. The
culprits had not just police protection and police connivance,
they had also police cover.

Apart from both the English and the language press,
barring Gujarati newspapers like Sandesh and Gujarat Samachar,
the coverage even in the foreign press was so shocking and
critical that it brought nothing but shame to India, known for
her respect for human rights. _Time_ magazine, for instance, gave
heart-rendering details of the atrocities on the Muslims. Its
report began with the story of a young Muslim girl named
Afsana who lived on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, the capital
of Gujarat. She heard that a Muslim mob had torched a train,
the Sabarmati Express at Godhra, she was appalled and very
frightened. She knew that revenge would be nigh. Her
neighbourhood, Naroda, was largely Hindu. On the day after
the Godhra killings, local Hindu leaders gathered a crowd of
2,000 residents and gave them simple instructions: Muslims
had to be destroyed. When part of the mob reached Afsana's
house, she fled with her five-year-old brother to a Hindu
neighbour's house. From her neighbour's roof, Afsana saw the
mob pull her parents out of their home, douse them in gasoline
and set them alight.

Her four sisters were stripped, raped and killed. Along the
lanes, other Muslim houses were burning. The story in _Time_
continued:

>After a couple of hours, her neighbour said it was
safe for her to leave. It was a trick. In the lane, a pack of men
attacked her. 'I fell on the ground,' she says, 'and I could see
all these people. They were people I knew who lived around
our house.' Both she and her brother were splashed with
gasoline but she managed to scramble up and get away,
clutching her brother's hand. Both of their clothes were alight.
When she reached a wall and started climbing up, she lost
hold of her brother. Once on a roof, she looked down and
watched him burnt to death.[^/002003]

[^/002003]:	_Time_, March 11, 2002.

Then there was another chilling incident reported in the
_International Herald Tribune_ thus:

>The mob of 500 Hindus
with wooden sticks and plastic jugs of kerosene swarmed
into this tiny farming town, chanting 'Kill the Muslims! Kill
the Muslims!' Trying to flee but surrounded on all sides by the
Hindu crowd, most of the town's Muslims took shelter in the
one place they believed was safe: a one-room house with thick
concrete walls and metal-barred windows at the end of their
neighbourhood. But the throng soon followed them there and
encircled the house. 'Get rid of the Muslims,' said some of the
Hindus; the Muslims panicked and started crying, those inside
the house begged for their lives. Please forgive us. Please let
us go,' said Ruksanabano Ibrahim, 20, who had locked herself
inside with a dozen family members. They kept saying, 'We
are not your enemies. What have we done to you?

The
influential journal, which has a wide circulation throughout
the world, reported further:

>Then, just as it did moments earlier
with shops, cars and other homes in the neighbourhood, the
mob doused cloth-wrapped sticks with kerosene, ignited them
and hurled them through the windows. The terrorized
occupants, who were locked inside the house, tried-in-vain to
smother the flames with woollen shawls and douse them with
bottles of drinking water. When police officers arrived half an
hour later and broke open the door, 29 people were dead.
Most of the others in the house were seriously burned.[^/002004]

There was yet another hair raising account of a Hindu
wife married to a Muslim who was brutally murdered by the
Hindu mob; it was written by Siddharth Varadarajan, Deputy
Chief of Bureau of _The Times of India_. His office in Ahmedabad
sent him a photograph with the following caption:

>On a hot
and dusty patch of asphalt lies the naked body of a woman, Geetaben,
her clothes stripped off and thrown carelessly near her. One piece of
her underclothing lies a foot away from her body, the other is clutched
desperately in her left hand. Her left arm is bloodied, as is her torso,
which appears to have deep gashes. Her left thigh is covered in blood
and she is wearing a small anklet. Her plastic chappals sit sadly
alongside her lifeless body and in the middle of the photo frame is a
gnarled, red, hate-filled remnant of a brick, perhaps the one her
assailants used to deliver their final blow.

Varadarajan reported the story of Geetaben in lurid details:

>Geetaben was killed in Ahmedabad on March 25, in broad
daylight, near a bus stop close to her home. She was a Hindu
who in the eyes of the Hindu separatists currently ruling Gujarat
had committed the cardinal sin of falling in love with a Muslim.
When the Sangh parivar mobs came for him, she stood her
ground long enough for him to flee. But the killers seemed
more interested in her. She was dragged out, stripped naked
and killed. No lethal dose of Zyklon-B delivered surreptitiously
in a darkened, secluded chamber. Geetaben's murder was never
meant to be a furtive, secret affair.

Varadarajan also reported
that there was

>not a single Muslim business left in Gujarat.
Photocopying stalls near Gujarati courts turn Muslim lawyers
away. Men with beards are not served in restaurants and shops
in the state. Muslim mothers pray their children won't call
them ammi on the street.[^/002005]

[^/002005]:	_The Times of India_, April 19, 2002.

However in the midst of the communal fire burning all
around, there have been Hindus who risked their lives to save
Muslims from the rage of communal Hindus; a practising lawyer,
Veersingh Rathod, gave protection to no less than 25 Muslim
families in Naroda; since then he has not moved out of his
own place as the lumpens, who had come to know what he
had done, were thirsting for his blood. He was certain that the
police would not protect him. There is also the incident,
reported by the press, about a young Muslim, who was running
with a small child, when the hoodlums stopped him. He assured
them that he was a Hindu. They allowed him to go. He had
hardly gone a few steps, when the child called out abba
to his father; the hoodlums heard him say so and caught
hold of them again and burnt to death both the young
man and his child.

What Barkha Dutt, the TV star, saw was still worse; she
found

>the body of a woman, mouth agape, legs wrenched
open, her head thrown back ... one arm still flailing in the air,
probably her last attempt to fight the man or men who had
raped her, before killing her.[^/002006]

Sagari Chhabra, a poet and film maker, went on a visit to
Ahmedabad; she came across many victims of the genocide
but what she heard from Mohammad Maroof, a resident of
Naroda Patia, was so ghastly that she hung her head in shame
and wondered what had happened to the people who were
the inheritors of the mission of non-violence, love and
compassion of the greatest Hindu of our times. Her record of
what Mohammad Maroof told her makes woeful reading:

>It
>was here that one of our neighbours (name withheld) of
>Gangotri Society came. He said, 'You must be hungry and
>thirsty, come to my house'. He was after all our neighbour and
>used to come to our weddings and functions. We thought this
>was bhaichara --- brotherhood --- so we all went. He took us to a
>large godaam --- storage space. He said --- 'Sit here, nothing will
>happen to you here.' Then he called his son, 'Beta, jitne hain
>unko bulao --- son, call all those who are there'. We found we
>were surrounded by people who were armed. They had talwars
>--- swords. We ran. From the other side, another neighbour
>(name withheld) came. We were surrounded from both sides
>and trapped in a gali (alley). We couldn't escape ...
>
>They had some powder with which you don't have to
>strike a match, you just throw it and it burns. They also threw
>petrol, kerosene, black oil and black tyres on us ... I was below
>in the heap which they set fire to. There was a young girl, her
>father's name is Kabir, they told her --- 'Beta, hum tumhe kuch
>nahi karenge, bahar aa jao --- we won't do anything to you, dear,
>come out.' She did. Phir uski izzat looti --- they raped her, maata
>jaat nanga kiya --- stripped her naked --- and pushed her into the fire.
>
>There was another girl who was hiding in the corner.
>They pounced on her, raped her and struck a sword through
>her below (points to his genitals) and up to here (points to his
>throat). She only screamed one word 'Chacha' (uncle). I heard
>that and got up. My three clothes were soaked in oil ... Those
>people started running away (this account of how the mob
>started moving away is unclear, he does not explain it in his
>testimony). We (the survivors) started taking the people out
>from the burning pit. The police came much later. They (the
>police) said we have come to your rescue. We took 65 people
>out of which 26 were still alive. The rest were all dead. The
>dead included my wife, my daughter and my brother's wife
>(he says this blandly, in a matter of fact voice). Maine khud
>laashen nikaali --- I took out their dead bodies myself. The police
>said leave them here or the others will also die. So we left
>them and took the living to the hospital (it is here he breaks
>down). Sister, till now, I haven't received their dead bodies
>or a post mortem report. Out of the 26 who were living,
>10 died in the hospital.[^/002007]

Namita Bhandare, a noted novelist, wrote in _Hindustan
Times_, that police officers who had done their jobs honestly
were transferred, while the incompetent ones were posted in
their places; these officers were more interested in pleasing
their masters than ensuring peace and normalcy. She cited
the case of Shivanand Jha, Joint Commissioner of Police, who
had fired at a mob in Sabarmati because it was demanding
that some Muslim boys whom the officer had arrested be
handed over to the mob. He refused. The mob reacted angrily;
the officer had to open fire. One Hindu was killed. Two days
later, Jha was at Sabarmati Ashram, where another mob was
demanding that the well-known social rebel, Medha Patkar
be evicted from a peace meeting; he resisted the demand.
In the melee that followed, some correspondents and press
photographers were burnt. Shivanand was blamed.
A.P. Parghi, the DCP, who had assisted Jha, had to resort to
_lathi_ charge to bring the mob under control. The next day
Parghi was also transferred. Why? asked Mrs.Bhandare. They
said "justice"; but it was because the Hindu mob complained
to the authorities against him.

Mrs. Bhandare heard several such complaints of transfer.
She said:

>To understand the complete breakdown of the state
in Gujarat, one has to consider only three incidents. In
Gandhinagar, where the state government has its offices, the
Wakf Board office was attacked. For the first time ever, curfew
was imposed in Gandhinagar. In another incident, the mob
burnt down trucks along with their Muslim drivers. This
happened at the front gate of the high court --- another symbol
of the Indian State. And finally the dargah of Wali Gujarati,
the seventeenth century Urdu poet was vandalized and
destroyed. This happened in front of the police commissioner's
office.

Mrs. Bhandare went on lividly:

>Does the Indian State
function in Gujarat --- a state where sitting judges fear for
their lives only because they are Muslims?[^/002008]

Rajmohan Gandhi, a grandson of the Mahatma and an
intellectual of the highest integrity and was horrified at the
theory of "action and reaction" propounded by the Chief
Minister and supported by many other Hindu dignitaries. In
his article in the _Hindustan Times_, he wrote that he was
dismayed at the statement of the RSS spokesman M.G. Vaidya,
who had called the post-Godhra violence in Gujarat a "natural
reaction of Hindus" which no government could have
controlled; the whole Hindu society, irrespective of caste, creed
and political affiliations had risen and reacted violently against
it. There was also the statement of Mahant Paramhans
Ramchandra Das who said,

>the Muslims roasted alive 57 kar
sevaks. It is a matter of shame that the government is protecting
Muslims while Hindus are unprotected in their country, even
by a BJP government.

The Mahant went on:

>Do you think there would be no
reaction to a bloody action? Why should I stop the movement
on this ground? Advani aur Atal hamare yagya ko bhrasht kar
rahe hain (Advani and Atal are polluting our yagya --- sacred
ceremony).

He warned that if they did not hand over the
land at Ayodhya, it would be taken over by force. Similarly
Swami Jayendra Saraswati the Kanchi Sankaracharya
pontificated that "there is a reaction for every action".

Rajmohan Gandhi was livid; he wrote:

>As would many other
Hindus, I strongly object to the suggestion that gassing, burning
alive or cutting to bits, women and children was a 'natural
reaction' of Hindus to the Godhra carnage. Some who dare to
call themselves Hindus may have done these horrifying things,
but Hindus as a whole are not that barbaric. Such defamatory
statements cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.[^/002009]

The attack on Muslim-owned establishments in many
places in Gujarat, according to reports in the national and
international press, were pre-planned; their correspondents
collected figures of the destruction of commercial units from
official sources and police reports; these confirmed that in the
initial stage itself, 72 hotels and restaurants owned by Muslims
were demolished, 35 properties belonging to Muslim residents
of a village in the Mehsana district, which is home to the
Chilliya Muslims were burnt down. Mrs. Bhandare wondered
how did the miscreants know these were owned by Muslims?
Apparently leaders of the rioters had done their research work.
She remarked:

>The Chilliya Muslims who were at the top of
the economic ladder were singled out for loot. Autorickshaw
drivers as well as scrap recyclers and vegetable vendors were
also not spared.

Brook Larmer, the special correspondent of _Newsweek_ of
New York met Mohammed Rafiq Lalmiya during his recent
visit to Gujarat; Lalmiya was a rickshaw driver. He lived in a
village called Naroda Patia, which was attacked by a Hindu
mob. Larmer reported,

>Lalmiya, a gaunt man in sandals and a
soiled yellow shirt, fled in terror with his wife and two children.
Today he has come back, his fear overcome by a desire to
salvage something --- anything, from his former life. What he
finds, however, is a community utterly destroyed. 'Nothing is
left,' he says, staring blankly at the twisted metal minarets on
the remains of the mosque. 'It's completely gone'.[^/0020010]

Brinda Karat, an influential crusader for women's rights
had taken a contingent of CPM workers from West Bengal to
give aid and succour to the genocide victims of Gujarat. What
she saw and heard had left her numb. She gave a poignant
account of one incident to _Frontline_ which was heartbreaking:

>Salimbhai lives in the madrasa camp in Sabarkantha district.
>He is the elected _sarpanch_ of Kidiyad village in Malpur taluka.
>There are 26 sarpanches in the taluka, and two of them are
>Muslims. Salimbhai was elected with the largest margin in the
>taluka. 'Seventy % of my voters were Hindus,' he told a
>delegation of the Left Front from West Bengal: 'They voted
>for me against a candidate from their own community because
>they have seen my social work for the village.' But such
>examples of secular politics were apparently intolerable to the
>rulers. So his village was attacked.
>
>On March 2, when news came of the arson, killings and
>attacks in neighbouring areas, there was no help forthcoming
>from the police. Salimbhai with 118 other Muslims decided to
>move to a more secure place. Concerned about ensuring the
>safety of the women and children, they sent them out in the
>first truck, escorted by some men. Among the 84 persons
>squeezed into the truck were his wife and 15-year-old son.
>The truck had travelled a fair distance from the village when
>it was stopped by a mob led by saffron-scarfed men shouting
>obscene slogans against Muslims. They could see that the truck
>was mainly filled with women and children. They burnt it.
>Sixty-seven people were burnt to death; among them were
>Salimbhai's wife and child. Later Salim learnt that within his
>village too people were killed and that the victims included
>his uncle. No one has been arrested.[^/0020011]

[^/0020011]:	_Frontline_, July 19, 2002.

From the survey made by the Concerned Citizens'
Tribunal, headed by the retired Supreme Court judge, V.R.
Krishna Iyer, even Muslim religious places were vandalized;
close to 240 mosques and dargahs had been razed to the ground
by the rioters; they also burnt all the documents pertaining to
them so that no claims could be considered for their
reconstruction.

A kind of religious sanctity was given to all these acts of
vandalism by the authorities; they were declared as enemy
property, which, it was alleged, were used to malign Hinduism.
The Hindus were therefore called upon through in a pamphlet
by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad to sever all connections with
Muslims and in "all their conscience save our country by
boycotting Muslims economically and socially". It was widely
circulated among the Hindus, particularly the youth, who were
told, according to _The Indian Express_:

>What is your security
even in the most decent and secure locality in spite of having
security guards? Traitors and terrorists are coming by truckloads.
They will kill your security guards and enter your bungalows.
They will murder you in your drawing rooms and bedrooms.
Those who talk of Hindu--Muslim unity are only maligning
their own religion. There can be no equality between Hindus
and Muslims. They do not consider Bharat as their motherland.
Hindu--Muslim unity is a farce. Communal harmony and
brotherhood is all a drama.[^/0020012]

In desperation, the well-known dancer Mallika Sarabhai,
a scion of the best known industrial family of Ahmedabad,
came out with an emotionally-charged indictment of all those
responsible for the genocide who had besmirched the face of
her beloved Gujarat. She wrote in _The Times of India_:

>I accuse.
For they have taken away my pride at being a human being,
the smile that lurked on my lips when I spoke of my city. They
have emptied my wardrobe of the colour saffron. They have
taken away my joy of belonging to a land of understanding
and compassion for difference. And the ability to say with a
glint in my eye that I belong to the people who gave Gandhiji
his non-violence.

She then catalogued her accusations one
by one:

>I accuse, for they have turned us all into puppets,
>pulled by the strings of selfish opportunism. Into a voiceless,
>gutless race. For having taken away the worst names we could
>call those others: animal; junglee; rakshasa; beast. For leaving
>us with only one name derogatory enough for what we have
>become: mankind.
>
>I accuse, for I have let myself be numbed into docility.
>Into feeling that I could get on with my work and things would
>be all right. That ultimately good would prevail. For letting
>the educated and 'should know better, should care more' group
>become the silent majority neutered by the vociferous lunatics
>set on self-destruction.
>
>I accuse. We have become a country of the blind and
>deaf, the self-centred and the soulless. We have become a
>country where our leaders lead us on superfluous paths of
>promises. Where leaders have become bleeders. Where warped
>priorities become the toast of the town, while reality withers
>with the disenfranchized.

Mallika Sarabhai concluded:

>There
are no external solutions left. There is no 'we' and no 'they'.
We are them. Myself and every citizen of this once great nation.
Yes, I accuse. Myself and every citizen of this once great nation.[^/0020013]

It was commonly feared that the police protected the
Hindu criminals. They refused to register FIRs against them.
Again, even where FIRs were filed, criminals were not arrested;
witnesses were afraid to testify against them. Meanwhile the
genocide continued unabated; normalcy rarely returned; curfew
was lifted and then re-imposed. The killers stalked Gujarat's
streets. The lynch mob became the arbiter of the routine affairs
of daily life: they decided who could live where, who could
say what, who could meet who, and where and when. Its
mandate was all pervading; it covered religious affairs as well
as property disputes, family altercations, planning and
allocation of water resources. Businesses belonging to Muslims
were shut down. They were not served in restaurants. Their
children were not welcome in schools. They were too terrified
to sit for examinations. Muslim parents lived in dread that
their infants might forget what was told to them --- no to
ever call them Ammi or Abba; if they did, they would be killed
or burnt instantly. Everywhere Muslims were unashamedly
informed that this was just the beginning; the end would be
much worse for them.

There was almost total destruction of Muslim businesses;
prosperous Muslim families were targeted and crippled
financially. The number of insurance claims was a clear
indication that the backbone of thousands of prosperous
Muslims had been broken. The National Insurance Company
confirmed that the claims with them exceeded Rs. 540 million.
The New India Assurance Company also reported that they
had received 1058 claims worth Rs. 340 million while the
claims registered with the United India Assurance Company
came to 1300 amounting to Rs. 400 million. The Oriental
Insurance Company was in receipt of 973 claims for Rs. 290
million. This was only the tip of the iceberg; the overall
economic losses of the Muslims were staggering. The looters
had made no distinction between small and big business
establishments; they destroyed whatever they could get hold
of --- hotels, restaurants, warehouses, shops, factories.

Indu Kumar Jani, a social activist in Ahmedabad, said he
was not aware of the fact that Tulsi, a chain of restaurants all
over Gujarat belonged to Muslims. He added that most of the
customers were Hindus and none of them knew that these
were owned by Muslims; the same was the case with the
Sarvodya 'pure vegetarian' restaurant. Not even Muslims knew
that these eateries were owned by members of their own
community. How then did the miscreants know? They seemed
to have been properly briefed. They gutted as many as 38 of
them in the initial days of the riots in Ahmedabad alone.
Fatima Bibi had taken shelter in Shah Alam Dargah camp
after the rioters said that they burnt her husband's warehouse
in one of the worst affected areas, Naroda Patia; thereafter she
said her husband became almost insane. He had stopped talking
and rarely ate anything given to him. And to add to these
miseries of the hapless Muslims, Hindus were told to boycott
their shops and restaurants, not to employ any of them, nor use
their services in any way.

Husain Umarji, who was running a relief camp in Godhra
city, said that even grants for their schools and societies had
been stopped because the donors were afraid they might be
targeted by Hindu miscreants and killed. He said that prior to
riots, the transport business, for instance, was owned by
Muslims in many districts but it had been completely destroyed;
thousands of trucks belonging to Muslims had been burnt.
The goons who did it did not realize that their insane act
would also harm the general trade and industry, dominated
by Hindus. Likewise when they smashed the diamond
cutting establishments, run by Muslims, they were blissfully
ignorant of the substantial loss they caused to the foreign
exchange earnings of India.

How did this madness continue so unchecked in an
industrially progressive state like Gujarat? Rajdeep Sardesai,
who had covered the affected extensively for Star TV said
that it was the passion of hate and prejudice against Muslims
which had gripped practically every section of Hindus from
the Brahmins to the _Dalits_. As he put it:

>The sheer social
and geographical spread of the conflagration, cutting across
traditional caste and class barriers is astounding and points to
a shocking collapse.

In a scathing analysis of the terrible
phenomenon, Rajdeep Sardesai pinpointed the factors which
brought this about:

>How else does one explain the large presence of _Dalits_
in the rioting? Or the manner in which migrant labour - a
large number of them OBCs - ruthlessly attacked their coworkers
in the Naroda-Patia area of Ahmedabad? Or why
the violence spread to Sabarkantha and Panchmahals, areas
in which the local _Adivasi_ community has been at the heart
of the rioting? Or the grotesque manner in which affluent
people walked into shops in Ahmedabad's main business
district and loaded their Marutis with the loot? In all instances,
there has been one common factor: for the most part, the
Muslim has been the victim, his life, family and livelihood
systematically targeted. The question is, why should the
people of a state which gave us Mahatma Gandhi, which
has a flourishing entrepreneurial spirit and which even today
has a strong NGO movement, succumb so easily to communal
polarization? Gandhi used this creatively as a mobilizing tool
while nurturing the notion of sarva dharma samabhava.
The parivar has used this destructively to create notions of
'Hindu brotherhood' by positing the Muslim as the
common enemy.[^/0020014]

[^/0020014]:	_The Indian Express_, April 9, 2002.

Some of these facts, as narrated above, are substantiated
by impartial observers. However it cannot be denied that a
number of Hindus have also died in police firing. Their
properties and businesses too have been adversely affected;
but that cannot be compared to what the Muslims suffered; as
_Frontline_ reported:

>Official data obtained by _Frontline_ makes
it clear that Muslims were the victims of a largely one-sided,
well-planned massacre. In fact, it makes little sense to describe
what happened as a communal riot. Although several
independent authorities believe that the data understates
Muslim casualties, they nonetheless bear out media allegations
of police bias. Although the number of Muslims killed was
more than five times the number of Hindus, and in value terms
Muslims lost almost 10 times the property that Hindus lost,
police firing was directed on both communities evenly.[^/0020015]

[^/0020015]:	_Frontline_, June 7, 2002.

The veracity of some of these facts were questioned by
the communal Hindus; they alleged that most of it was
motivated and exaggerated. One of their spokesmen, Balbir
K. Punj, a BJP Member of Parliament accused Arundhati Roy,
for instance, of distortion of facts and even of outright lying;
he said her version pertaining to the death of the ex-MP
Jafri, was a tissue of lies. She had written that while Jafri was
being burnt, his daughters were raped. The daughters, Punj
said, were in fact in America. Roy apologized for the error
but Punj was not satisfied. He castigated her and the media,
both print and electronic, for their false campaign against
the Hindus in Gujarat.

He told the _Outlook_ magazine:

>Loss of 900-odd
>innocent lives (both Hindus and Muslims) is definitely not a
>'genocide' of any one community. Yet it is one more shameful
>event in the long and unfortunate chain of communal riots
>in India, since the 1893 Bombay and Azamgarh riots.
>Beginning from the 1714 Holi riots in the Mughal period,
>Ahmedabad itself has witnessed no less than 10 major recorded
>riots. The Sangh parivar was not there in 1714, nor was it a
>dominant force during the 1969 and 1985 riots. So what
>explains these riots when Gujarat was not a 'Sangh parivar
>petri dish'? Out of those who perished in the communal frenzy,
>over one-third are Hindus. Following Godhra, massive
>spontaneous violence broke out in various parts of Gujarat
>against the Muslims. Since the rioters were mainly Hindus,
>they also accounted for about 75% of those who fell to
>police bullets in the first three days. In fact, till April 18, Hindus
>accounted for more deaths in police firing than Muslims. But
>for almost three weeks now, the violence has been led by
>Muslims against Hindus and, naturally, a bulk of the casualties
>are accounted for by them.
>
>The police have booked 34,000 rioters, majority of whom
>are Hindus. Both communities have suffered heavy loss of
>business and property in the arson and looting. While rioters
>are communal in picking their targets, looters are not --- and
>they target at random. One lakh Muslims are struggling in
>relief camps, but so are 40,000 Hindus. This is a horrible riot,
>which is sad enough, but why call it a genocide? Whom does
>it help? Not the riot victims, only our enemies across the
>border ... The secular pack is not only guilty of parading halftruths
>but also of condoning and inciting violence ...

Punj also criticized the Editors' Guild, which had come
down heavily on the Gujarati press for its coverage of the riots ...
He wrote:

>Surprisingly, the Guild has nothing critical to say on the
role of the electronic media and of the Roys, guilty of blackening
India's name, generating more communal hate at a critical time
and demonising a section of citizens through half-truths and
complete lies. Some rioters may be guilty of rape and should be
punished for their heinous crimes, but what about those who have
raped the truth and the country in the last two months?.[^/0020016]

Some of the facts and figures, so eloquently advanced
by Punj, may be true but his charge of distortion and
exaggeration of facts is not in consonance with what has
been pointed out by responsible Indian and foreign
organizations whose credibility could not be challenged.
The National Human Rights Commission in its report
referred to it:

>Given the widespread reports and allegations
of groups of well-organized persons, armed with mobile
telephones and addresses, singling out certain homes and
properties for death and destruction in certain districts,
sometimes within view of police stations and personnel,
the further question arises as to what the factors were, and
who the players were in the situation that went out of
control.[^/0020017]

[^/0020017]:	_Hindustan Times_, May 19, 2002.

Similarly the National Minorities Commission
pointed out in its report that

>attacks were organized by
the VHP and the Bajrang Dal who had earlier gathered
information on minority houses, shops, etc. The attacks
were planned accordingly, with first looting, and then
burning of shops and establishments along with brutal
violence, stabbing and battering of people; besides burning
them alive with kerosene, petrol and diesel; they also alleged
sexual assault on women and gang-rapes in the presence of
their relations. The victims were then killed and burnt.[^/0020018]

[^/0020018]:	_Ibid_., May 15, 2002.

The Human Rights' Watch of America in its report said:

>What happened in Gujarat was not a spontaneous uprising;
it was a carefully orchestrated attack against Muslims. The
attacks were planned in advance and organized with extensive
participation of the police and state government officials.

The
European Union condemned the carnage in Gujarat as "a kind
of apartheid ... it has parallels with the Germany of 1930s".
United Kingdom and Canada also expressed grave concern at
the massacre and loot of the Muslims; so did several other
foreign countries. Only the Muslim countries were indifferent
to the happenings; there was not even "a whimper of protest
from them at the official level."

By targeting authors like Roy for a lapse, truth cannot be
suppressed; most impartial reports confirmed that what happened
in Gujarat was a clear case of genocide. Punj objected to the use
of the word; so have many other well-meaning Hindus. But
according to the definition given by the Oxford Dictionary, it
means "the mass extermination of human beings, especially of a
particular race or nation". If a mob of thousands kills and burns
Muslims in Muslim-populated areas, what is it, if not genocide.
Pritish Nandy, the Shiv Sena MP was anguished at what had
happened in Godhra and Gujarat; but he was furious at what
had not happened to relieve the pain of the sufferers and to
rebuild their lives. He quoted a poem of Bob Dylan:

>How many ears must one man have
>
>Before he can hear people cry?
>
>How many deaths will it take till he knows
>
>That too many people have died?
>
>The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
>
>The answer is blowin' in the wind.[^/0020019]

[^/0020019]:	_Ibid_., March 8, 2002.

The atrocities on Muslims in Gujarat were witnessed by
hundreds of Indian and foreign observers; some of them might
have exaggerated while commenting on what they saw; some
wrong information might also have crept in their statements;
but on the whole what the communal Hindus did, as the Prime
Minister himself stated, was "a blot on the face of India".

The last word on it has been said by the former Chief
Justice J.S. Verma who heads the National Human Rights
Commission. He said:

>The Gujarat carnage was nothing short
of war in terms of the suffering undergone by the affected
people. How is it different from war? Are their sufferings any
less than in war.

In war people die while fighting; in Gujarat
innocent and helpless men, women and children were taken
out of their homes and burnt alive for no fault of theirs. Justice
Verma asked: "How can this happen in our country? It haunts
every patriotic Indian. I hope I don't live to witness it again".[^/0020020]
