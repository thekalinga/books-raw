# Policy and Operation of the Statutes of Limitation

Title by adverse possession sounds, at first blush, like title by
theft or robbery, a primitive method of acquiring land without
paying for it. When the novice is told that by the weight of authority
not even good faith is a requisite, the doctrine apparently affords
an anomalous instance of maturing a wrong into a right contrary
to one of the most fundamental axioms of the law.

>For true it is, that neither fraud nor might
Can make a title where there wanteth right.[^/1]

The policy of statutes of limitation is something not always
clearly appreciated. Dean Ames, in contrasting prescription in
the civil law with adverse possession in our law, remarks: "English
lawyers regard not the merit of the possessor, but the demerit of
the one out of possession."[^/2] It has been suggested, on the other
hand, that the policy is to reward those using the land in a way
beneficial to the community.[^/3] This takes too much account of the
individual case. The statute has not for its object to reward the
diligent trespasser for his wrong nor yet to penalize the negligent
and dormant owner for sleeping upon his rights; the great purpose
is automatically to quiet all titles which are openly and consistently
asserted, to provide proof of meritorious titles, and correct errors
in conveyancing.[^/4]

>The thing to be looked at is the possession of the defendant,--- not the
want of possession in the plaintiff. A possession which has continued for
a long time without interruption, and which has been accompanied by
an uninterrupted claim of ownership, ought to prevail against all the
world.[^/5]

Although in general a tortious act can never be the foundation of
a legal or equitable title, yet if the exercise of apparent ownership is
made conclusive evidence of title, this wholesale method necessarily
establishes and quiets the bad along with the good. The trespasser
benefits, the true owner suffers, for the repose of meritorious titles
generally. As Sir Frederick Pollock puts it, "It is better to favor
some unjust than to vex many just occupiers."

It is one thing to have the rightful ownership and just title to
land; it is another thing to have the proof of that right which can
be laid before a purchaser or before a jury. Suppose a landowner
is ejected from his land and seeks to be reinstated. The deed under
which plaintiff acquired title, without evidence of possession by
the grantor of the premises conveyed, is not even _prima facie_ proof
of title such as to warrant recovery in ejectment. Nor is a connected
chain of deeds, which does not reach back to the Government
or to some grantor in possession, sufficient, unless it reaches
back to some common source of title, or to some source acknowledged
to be genuine and valid, or unless there is some estoppel to
deny title.[^/6] The proof of a paper title sufficient to make out a
_prima facie_ right to possession of land may, therefore, be exceedingly
difficult. It involves proving the signature and delivery of
every deed; the corporate existence of every corporation in the
chain of title; the execution of all powers of attorney; all the statutory
notices and formalities in execution, tax and probate sales;
all the descents and probate proceedings; in short, every legal step
of the transfer of the title, voluntary and involuntary, simple and
complex, from a recognized source down must be shown by proper
evidence. In order to give adequate protection to other titles, it
has been found necessary to recognize possession as title.[^/7] It is
therefore enough that a plaintiff in ejectment, or that his ancestor
or one of his grantors, was in possession and that this prior possession
is vested in the plaintiff by a regular devolution of title. A
mere trespasser cannot set up an outstanding title in a third person
as a defense where he does not claim under it.[^/8]

Upon every sale or mortgage of land it is necessary that the
evidence of the title be critically examined. For what period and
from what source should the title be deduced? The conveyancer
in the United States usually looks for a record title going back to a
patent from the United States, the state, or some other government
for a clear root of title. In England, evidence of the original royal
feoffments or gifts of former centuries was long since lost. The
proprietor must go back to the earliest possessor or occupant who
can be proved to have held seisin in fee. Except for government
grant, possession is thus the ultimate root of all titles. Title deeds are
nothing but the history or evidence of the transfer of rights arising
from possession, reaching back perhaps to "that mailed marauder,
that royal robber," that great adverse possessor, --- William the Conqueror.
"Every title to land has its root in seisin; the title which
has its root in the oldest seisin is the best title."[^/9] With the help
of statutes of limitation, however, it is now ordinarily sufficient for
the English conveyancer to go back forty years for a root of title.
It may be instructive to sketch the history of the statutes by
which limitations were placed on ancient seisin as a source of title.

The only limitation on a writ of right to recover seisin at common
law was lack of evidence. Several early statutes of limitation were
passed, of which the Statute of Westminster I, 3 Edward I, c. 39 (1275), is typical. This statute did not purport expressly to bar
any remedy or pass any title but merely placed a fixed limit back
of which a suitor in a real action could not go for a source of title.
It provided that in conveying (tracing) a descent in a writ of right,
none shall presume to declare of the seisin of his ancestor further or
beyond the beginning of the reign of King Richard I (1189). In
other real actions the demandant could not go back so far. The
effect, therefore, was that a more recent seisin, though tortious,
became a paramount source of title.

LAW, ch. 8, 267, 295, 314.

The Statute of 32 Henry VIII, c. 2, § 3, limited real actions by
providing that if the claimant rested his title on the ground of
former seisin by himself, he was limited to a seisin within thirty
years before the teste or date of the original writ, as regards both
droitural and possessory actions; if on the ground of a seisin by his
ancestor, to a seisin within fifty years as regards possessory actions,
and within sixty years as regards droitural actions.[^/10] The demandant
in a writ of right must allege and prove seisin in his ancestor
within sixty years. Hence seisin that could be traced back sixty
years became a good root of title.[^/11] This was for the reason that
no older seisin which had been lost could be resorted to.[^/12]

Coke says, in his note to Littleton,[^/13]

>Limitation, as it is taken in law, is a certaine time prescribed by statute,
within which the demandant in the action must prove himselfe or some
of his ancestors to be seised.

The limitation of 32 Henry VIII is wholly referable to seisin, the
statute requiring a seisin within a certain time according to the
nature of the writ. The limitation is dated from the seisin, not
from the disseisin. The operation of the older statutes is thus not
to bar the action, but to bar the source of title or right to which
the more recent tortious seisin could be made to yield.

The Statute 21 Jac. I, c. 16 (1623), adopts the modern method
of limiting the right of entry, and so the action of ejectment, to
within twenty years next after the right of entry accrues. The
right of entry does not accrue until some one initiates an adverse
possession.[^/14] The effect of limiting all right of action to recover
possession is much the same as that of expressly limiting seisin as a
source of title; possession exercised continuously and adversely
for a certain time becomes a source of title superior in ejectment
to any title derived from an older possession. The Statute of 21
James I, c. 16 (1623), however, did no more than bar or take away
the right of entry and ejectment after twenty years, but left open
the real action by writ of right for forty years more. Consequently
it was held in England that the right of entry and the remedy by
ejectment, might be barred, but that the "mere right" itself was
left outstanding.[^/15] To remedy this the Statute 3 & 4 William IV,
c. 27 (1833), was enacted, which not only bars the remedy of ejectment
but expressly abolishes real actions and extinguishes the
former title after twenty years.[^/16] By the Real Property Limitation
Act of 1874[^/17] the period of limitation is reduced to twelve years
from the time the right of action first accrued.

American statutes quite commonly follow the parent statute of
James I. Illinois, for example, enacts:[^/18]

>That no person shall commence an action for the recovery of lands,
nor make an entry thereon, unless within twenty years (1) after the right
to bring such action or make such entry first accrued, or (2) within twenty
years after he or those from, by, or under whom he claims, have been
seized or possessed of the premises.

Since the owner is deemed to be seised or possessed unless there is
another in adverse possession, actual or constructive, clauses one (1) and two (2) apparently come to exactly the same thing. The
owner's mere absence from the land does not disable him from
bringing an action against an intruder. The second clause as to
seisin or possession is apparently an interesting relic of the provisions
of the older type of statutes.[^/19]

The form of statutes of limitation varies; in some of them there
are provisions expressly extinguishing the right or title of the former
owner; most of them in terms merely bar the remedy by ejectment;
but it is the almost invariable rule that the effect of the statute is
not only to bar the remedy of ejectment, but also to take away all
other remedy, right, and title of the former owner.[^/20] It is well to
notice that this result does not follow necessarily from the statute
alone, but arises from the joint operation of the statute and the
common law. If a person has a right and several remedies, the
bar of one remedy is not the discharge of all the others.[^/21]

Under American statutes, as under the Statute of James I,
there may be some remedies which are not expressly affected by
the terms of the statute. But when the statute extinguishes the
remedy in ejectment to recover possession, the common law and
also equity say that the possession shall not be questioned by the
former owner in any other manner, either by self-help, by action
of trespass, or by a bill in equity. The earlier statutes of limitation
did not mention bills in equity as subject to the bar; but nevertheless
they were followed in equity as well as at law on the principle
of analogy, and on the principle that where a thing is forbidden
by law in one form it shall not be done in another.[^/22] The judicature
by its own rulings has thus imposed limitations, guiding itself by
the policy of the statute to quiet the possessory title.

As the Wisconsin Supreme Court has pointed out,[^/23] it would be
a strange anomaly to hold that the law which bars the owner from
recovering possession or the use of the land itself, after he has
acquiesced in a usurped ownership by another for twenty years,
should yet leave him at liberty to assert title in other ways as by
action of trespass for mesne profits, by extra-judicial re-entry or
by suit in equity to quiet title, for partition or for an accounting.
It seems a necessary consequence of the policy underlying the
limitation acts that one should be considered to have no right or
title when the most essential incident or legal consequence of title,
the right to recover possession, is barred. Hopeless confusion would
result from the recognition of any such anomalous titles, without
right of possession, surviving the statute. The maxim that where
there is a right there is a remedy may be turned about e converso,
so that where there is no remedy there is no right. The only cloud
on the possessor's title is the true owner's right to recover possession
by entry or ejectment, or by some other remedy, and when these
remedies are all taken away by the statute or by analogy thereto,
the defect in the possessory title becomes cured.

It has indeed been said by some eminent judges that the effect of
the statute is "to make a parliamentary conveyance of the land to
the person in possession at the last moment when the period has
elapsed."[^/24] As Gibson, C. J., puts it, "The instant of conception is
the instant of birth," without any period of gestation or maturing
of an inchoate title. The idea seems to be that the statute of limitations
is a conveyancer like the Statute of Uses, which, when there
is a deed by Doe to the use of Roe and his heirs, "executes the use,'
and,---

>Like flash of electricity,
The land's transferr'd in fee to Roe,
Nothing at all remains in Doe.[^/25]

But there is, in truth, no such transfer of title by the statute of
limitations. The direct effect of the statute is negative, to extinguish
the right of entry of the ousted owner. The indirect effect is
to quiet the title of the possessor. Title is thus established by the
joint operation of the statute and the common law. The possession
of the adverse holder, although gained by manifest wrong, and
although liable to be defeated by entry of the rightful owner, is
_per se_ a title good as shield or sword, either to hold or to recover
possession, as against all others. Even the title of the original
owner is affected ab initio, by disseisin, although not so much to-day
as formerly. His "right of entry" should hardly be regarded, as
Dean Ames regarded it, as being reduced to a mere chose in action.
His remedy is limited, however, by the common law to asserting
his rights by a direct proceeding to recover possession.[^/26] The
statute operates to relieve the adverse holder from this sole danger
of eviction, and, being thus quieted, the once precarious possession
becomes a firm and indefeasible title even against the former owner
as of the date when the disseisin or adverse possession commenced.[^/27]

34 Ill. 436 (1864). See 69 L. R. A. 762, note.

Accordingly we must not confound the negative operation of
the statute with the positive effect of a conveyance of the title
from the true owner to the adverse possessor at the moment the
statute has fully run. In Tichborne v. Weir[^/28] it is held that when
one holds adversely to a lessee for ninety-nine years, the adverse
possessor cannot be treated as an assignee so as to render him liable
on the covenants of the lease. It is sometimes said, indeed, that
the law presumes a conveyance by the true owner on the grounds
of public policy when the right of entry is gone.[^/29] But it is unnecessary
to resort to the presumption or fiction of a conveyance.[^/30]
Adverse possession vests the possessor with the complete title as
effectually as if there had been a conveyance by the former owner.[^/31]
But the title is independent, not derivative, and "relates back" to
the inception of the adverse possession.[^/32] The adverse possessor
does not derive his title from the former owner, but from a new
source of title, his own possession. The "investitive fact" is the
disseisin and exercise of possession.[^/33]

It is only in case of incorporeal rights that title is acquired by
length of adverse user. Title is not gained by length of adverse
possession under the statute, except as against the true owner. In
case of rights of way and other easements when acquired by prescription,
the adverse user under claim of title is also the "investitive
fact." The important difference is that apparently here there
is no possessory title to the way either as against the servient owner
or against the world, until the right has been asserted for the full
prescriptive period; there is no "legally protected possession of an
incorporeal thing."[^/34] Take the case of a way used by A for four
years on B's land. Would the claimant and possessor of the quasidominant
be protected in his use against third persons? Mr. Justice
Holmes doubts it.[^/35]

The inchoate title by prescription, the potentiality of acquiring
an easement within less than twenty years, is, however, something
which can be transmitted with the quasi-dominant tenement so
that the successive periods of user may be tacked where there is
privity between the successive claimants.[^/36] The legislative policy
of prescription and adverse possession is the same, --- that titles to
property should not remain uncertain and in dispute, but that
continued _de facto_ exercise and assertion of a right should be conclusive
evidence of the _de jure_ existence of the right.

>The earliest act of user proved, tends to prove a right then existing.
Such light evidence gains force by continued repetition, until
at the end of twenty years it becomes, unexplained, conclusive evidence
of right.[^/37]

Prescription, therefore, like adverse possession, operates to quiet
titles which have been consistently asserted, and the requisites are
in general the same.

If we had a scientific system for the registration of titles, adverse
possession would be of far less importance. Accordingly we find
that title by adverse possession is not recognized under some of the
Torrens Acts, although it is under others.[^/38] But under our crude
conveyancing and recording systems this doctrine is indispensable
as a protection to just titles. Every title in the country may easily
come to depend for its establishment to a greater or less extent on
adverse possession. In spite of our elaborate books of record,
possession remains the great source, muniment, and quieter of
titles to land.

The extent of title and estate thus acquired, whether for years,
for life, or in fee, is measured by the claim of title. "If the party
claim only a limited estate and not a fee, the law will not, contrary
to his intentions, enlarge it to a fee." Where a title depends upon
possession, the estate evidenced by his possession depends upon
the claim of title which he makes by his declarations or his
acts.[^/39]

Certain qualifications of the title acquired by adverse possession
follow from the fact that it arises from possession. There is an
important limitation on the rule that bare possession is title good
against all the world except the true owner. American courts hold
that a bare possessor of land cannot recover full damages for a
permanent injury. In Winchester v. City of Stevens Point[^/40] the
defendant constructed a high embankment which caused the flooding
of plaintiff's lot. The plaintiff recovered in the trial court for
the permanent depreciation of her property. She had to rely upon
possessory title, as she failed to prove a good paper title owing to
the fact that two deeds had only one subscribing witness. It was
held that, as in condemnation proceedings, plaintiff must show
absolute or complete title and that title will not be presumed for
this purpose from evidence of possession under claim of title. Apparently
plaintiff must show either (1) a complete chain of title
from the Government, or (2) title by adverse possession.[^/41]

In a recent Illinois case it is held that where title by adverse
possession becomes complete after a cause of action for permanent
injury to the land from flooding accrues, the plaintiff corporation
cannot recover, as it did not have (absolute) title to the land by
adverse possession or otherwise at the time the right of action
accrued.

"That its title became complete by prescription after the cause of action
accrued places it in no different position from what it would have been
if it had not been in possession but had acquired title by conveyance
after the right of action accrued."[^/42]

This case may be explained on the theory that the statute of limitations
simply quiets that title which the adverse possessor already
has by virtue of his possession, and the doctrine of relation does
not cure any defects in the possessory title except the former
owner's right to recover possession.

The statutory extinguishment of the title of the dispossessed
owner of land does not destroy easements or restrictive covenants,
and it has been held that persons entitled to the benefit of restrictive
covenants may enforce them against the new owner by adverse
possession.[^/43] These burdens and privileges with reference to the
land are not incident to the estate of the dispossessed owner, and
adverse possession of the land does not destroy them, if there is
no adverse user.

The efficiency of the doctrine of adverse possession in quieting
title is greatly impaired by reason of two exceptions to the operation
of the statute, viz., that of disabilities and that of future estates.
It has been proposed by the American Association of Title Men (1913), in order to render land titles simpler and more secure, to
reduce the period of limitation on actions to recover land to ten
years, and to abolish the saving clauses for persons under disability.
If titles were quieted by possession regardless of disabilities, such
as absence from the state, infancy, insanity, coverture, or imprisonment,
this would add greatly to the security of all titles, and we
should then be able to rely on mere lapse of time, coupled with
proof of continuity of possession and claim of title, to cure all defects
and automatically to quiet titles. Friends or relatives or
guardians will ordinarily protect the rights of owners under disability,
and individual cases of hardship would be more than balanced
by the greater security of all titles.

By the general rule, the statute of limitations on ejectment does
not begin to run against a remainderman, or the holder of any other
future interest until the preceding estate terminates, and he becomes
entitled to immediate possession. This is based on the
proposition that the right of action does not accrue until that time,
as he has no right of action until he is entitled to possession. It
follows that while a life estate is outstanding, no one can initiate a
holding adverse to the remainderman.[^/44]

The consequence is that, although one may hold possession of
land for twenty years, claiming to own it absolutely against all the
world, and may have color of title and pay taxes thereon, yet this
possession will not be adverse to the holder of any future interest,
although the claim may be brought home to the remainderman.[^/45]

By a somewhat daring piece of judicial legislation it has been held
in Iowa and Nebraska that, where the statutes give a person out of
possession an equitable remedy to quiet title, a remainderman may
be barred by adverse possession where he has notice of the adverse
holding.[^/46] It is urged that the purpose of the statute is to provide
a way to settle disputed questions of title between those in possession
of land and those who claim a future interest. Where an adverse
claim of ownership is brought home to the holder of such
future interest, his welfare, as well as that of the public in general,
is best subserved by requiring that questions of title be settled
within the statutory period. Accordingly, ejectment and all other
remedies will be barred if the remainderman allows ten years to
elapse after his right of action to quiet title accrues and thereafter
the adverse possessor can quiet title in himself.[^/47]

It may be argued that the barring of one remedy, viz., an action
to quiet title, should not affect other remedies which have not yet
accrued.[^/48] But this is something that the courts have done in
limiting equitable actions by analogy to the statute of limitations
on ejectment; and if policy demands it, a reciprocal limitation of
legal actions by analogy would seem equally justifiable. Opinions
may differ as to the justice of such extension of the doctrine of
adverse possession, but it would have the beneficent effect of
bringing up for settlement disputed questions of title before they
become stale, and would obviate one of the most serious defects
in this automatic method of quieting titles against possible adverse
claims which now arises from our undue tenderness towards the
holders of future interests.

# Privity and Tacking between Successive Holders

It is the almost universal rule of law as laid down by decisions
in this country that "privity of estate" is necessary between successive
adverse holders to authorize "tacking" their several possessions
together.[^/49] The several occupancies must be so connected
that each occupant can go back to the original entry or holding as
a source of title. The successive occupants must claim through
and under their predecessors and not independently to make a
continuous holding united into one ground of action. It is generally
held that this connection may be established by any of the
usual methods of transferring title, voluntary or involuntary, and
also by the mere informal delivery of possession by mutual consent.
There is privity between ancestor and heir, testator and devisee,
vendor and vendee, lessor and lessee, judgment debtor and execution
purchaser.[^/50] Privity is not presumed. The burden of proving
privity is on the one claiming by adverse possession.[^/51]
arise in showing any recognized connection to permit tacking
possessions. Thus where a widow continues in the possession of
land held adversely by her deceased husband, it has been held that
the widow is not entitled to tack her husband's possession to her
own. It is argued that, since the widow has no right in the land
before her dower is assigned, her entry is a new disseisin.[^/52] Privity
is, however, worked out between husband and wife in numerous
cases, which hold that the widow's holding, if in subordination to
the heirs at law, may be tacked to that of her husband.[^/53] Although
the widow is neither heir, devisee, nor grantee and does not succeed
to her deceased husband's inchoate title, yet if she occupies under
her dower, quarantine or homestead right, or as guardian of her
children, her possession may be tacked to that of her husband so
that it will enure to the benefit of the heirs.[^/54]

In the absence of formal transfer of title, some difficulty may

[^/51]: Doe v. Brown, 4 Ind. 143 (1853); Ryan v. Schwartz, 94 Wis. 403, 69 N. W. 178 (1896).

The holding of a decedent and his personal representative cannot
be tacked unless there is a legal right of possession to administer
the decedent's lands.[^/55] It is, however, held that the possession of
real estate by an executor with power of sale may be tacked to that
of his testator in establishing title by adverse possession.[^/56] The
possession of the executor or administrator may be deemed a continuance
of that of the deceased, where by statute he has the right
to take possession of the real estate and actually does so for the
benefit of the estate. The continuity of adverse possession is not
interrupted by the ordinary lapse of time between the deceased's
death and the appointment of an administrator and the taking of
possession by him.

It is submitted that there cannot be tacking between testator
and devisee under a void will, as there would be no transfer or
delivery of possession, and the inchoate possessory title would
devolve upon the heir, who would be the only one who could continue
the same claim of title, and take advantage of the ancestor's
possession.[^/57] A few courts apparently require continuous formal
transfers to make privity, and hold that successive possessions
cannot be connected by delivery of more than the tract actually
described in deeds between the parties, although more is intended
to pass and possession may be actually taken by the grantee.[^/58]
According to the great weight of authority, however, if possession
is transferred as to all, including the land outside the limits described,
tacking is allowed.[^/59]

>If each grantee succeeds to the possession of his grantor, there is such
privity between the occupants that their several possessions are referred
to and regarded as continuous.

It is said that

>the privity required is a continuous possession by mutual consent, so that
the possession of the true owner shall not constructively intervene.[^/60]

The courts have been somewhat put to it for an explanation of
the doctrine that an oral agreement and delivery of possession,
ordinarily not sufficient to transfer title to land, are sufficient to
make "privity of estate." The theory advanced by the Wisconsin
court is that privity is purely a question of continuity of physical
possession, and has no relation to the transfer of title or claim of
title. In Illinois Steel Co. v. Paczocha[^/61] the court remarks,

>It is said that there must be privity between the successive occupants,
but this does not at all mean that there must be a privity of title. . .
The privity between successive occupants required for the statute of
limitations is privity merely of that physical possession, and is not dependent
upon any claim, or attempted transfer, of any other interest
or title in the land.

This theory is believed to be erroneous. Privity of estate means
succession to the possessory title. Suppose the adverse possessor, A.
has previously sold and conveyed his possessory title to B, who
fails to enter, and then delivers possession to C by oral agreement.
C enters and holds for the balance of the period. There is privity
of physical possession, but not privity of estate between A and C,
except as to a new adverse possession which A may have initiated
since his grant to B.

Oral tacking is allowed because the inchoate prescriptive title
may be transferred by the possessor by mere delivery. If he abandons
or conveys to B he has nothing to transfer. But the grantor
can hardly set up the possession, which he has abandoned by delivery,
as a title in an action of ejectment against his grantee.[^/62]
An oral agreement of transfer would be valid as against third parties
at least, even if questionable under the statute of frauds as
between the immediate parties to the grant.[^/63]

In tacking constructive adverse possessions under color of title,
it has been held in New York that there must be a regular deed or
formal conveyance from holder to holder. It is argued that a void
deed will not place the successor in the predecessor's shoes as to
such claim of title. "Every adverse possession is a wrong amounting
to an inchoate right." To make continuity of estate with the
prior constructive adverse possession, it is essential that this inchoate
title pass along the line by conveyance, as there is no corporeal
seisin which can be transferred by livery.[^/64] It has, however,
been held by certain other courts, that a formal deed under seal is
not necessary to tack constructive possessions. If there is some
written instrument, and a colorable transfer, so that the latter
claimant shall apparently hold by right of the former, this will be
sufficient.[^/65] It is the legislative and judicial policy to favor those
claims of title that are evidenced by written instruments of transfer,
both as to the period within which they will be quieted and as
to the tangible acts of ownership which will amount to adverse
possession. Delivery of actual possession of part of the land held
under color of title may well be considered constructive delivery
of possession of the entire tract described, even though the deed
of conveyance be without a seal or scroll or be otherwise defective.
It is the very purpose of the doctrine of adverse possession to cure
technical defects in the evidence of title.

592, 597 (1873).

The underlying theory of title by adverse possession is put to
the acid test by the problem presented when one disseisor or converter,
B, has been, in turn, dispossessed by another wrongdoer, C.
The question is whether the successive adverse holdings have a
different effect on the right of the original owner, A, than where
the holdings connect by means of a transfer. A few courts and
writers looking at the owner's continuous laches rather than at
the possessor's consistent claim of title, have discarded or condemned
the requirement of privity for acquiring title by adverse
possession. For them it should be enough to show that the owner has
been continuously kept out of possession for the statutory period.
Thus Dean Ames, in his well-known essay on the nature of ownership,[^/66]
says,

>C, although a disseisor, and therefore not in privity with B, may
tack the time of B's adverse possession to his own to make out the
statutory period against A. This tacking is allowed in England, Canada,
and in several of our States.[^/67]

Dean Ames argues that the widespread opinion to the contrary must
be deemed erroneous.

"The laches of the original owner who remains continuously dispossessed
throughout the statutory period, is the same, and should be
attended with the same consequences to him, whether the adverse possession
be held continuously by one or several persons, and whether subsequent
possessors do or do not stand in privity with their predecessors."

In Illinois Steel Co. v. Budzisz,[^/68] Marshall, J., discusses with his
usual elaboration the requisites of adverse possession, and declares
that the letter of the statute only calls for the disseisin or exclusion
of the true owner for twenty years, but by judicial construction the
requirement that successive possessions be connected by privity has
been super-added. It is commonly said to be the reason for the requirement
of privity that the possession of the disseised owner revives
between successive disseisins, and the continuity of possession between
the adverse claimants is thereby broken.[^/69] This reason,
however, seems unsound and fictitious.[^/70] The real reason for the
requirement, if any, would seem to be that the new entry gives rise
to a new right of action against each occupant, rather than that when
the first disseisor is interrupted, the interruption, though but for a
moment, permits the seisin of the true owner to revest by operation
of law.[^/71] The vital question would seem to be not how long has
the owner been out of possession and failed to sue, but, on the other
hand, how long has the defendant by himself and his predecessors
asserted a consistent claim of title. Privity of estate might, then,
be explained as one aspect of the requirement of claim of title, viz.,
that the holding must be under the same claim of title. In order
to be regarded as the same cause of action, it must be connected,
consistent, and continuous.

If there is a series of independent holdings, one is no evidence
in support of the rightfulness of the others. Each is a different
claim of title, and new ground of action. The trespasser cannot
go further back for the origin of his title than the day of his entry
into possession. It is believed that there is very little authority
for dispensing with the requirement of privity, and that the cases
cited for this by Dean Ames do not go to the full extent supposed.

In Doe v. Barnard[^/72] it is apparently held that you can tack under
the English statute, 3 & 4 William IV, without privity, so as to
use the prior possession as a shield, but not to use it as a sword.
The result of that case, and the companion one of Doe v. Carter,[^/73]
would seem to be that the widow, while in possession, could bring
trespass against, or resist ejectment by, the true owner, but being
ousted could not sue in ejectment against a stranger, because she
was not in privity with the prior possession of her husband, but
showed title to his possession to be in her son. Apparently under
this theory the rightful owner may be barred, although the last
holder has neither acquired the statutory title nor possession good
against third parties. The true owner cannot eject the last trespasser
in possession, but if the tables are turned the last trespasser
cannot eject former owner if put out by him.

In Groom v. Blake[^/74] the case of Doe v. Carter is stated and criticized
and the anomaly is pointed out in this doctrine that property
should become quasi-derelict without a rightful owner under the
operation of the statute. If the statute does run against the true.
owner, it will enure to the benefit of the first rather than of the
last or the intermediate trespasser. Doe v. Barnard is overruled by
Asher v. Whitlock in so far as it holds that a defendant may justify
interference with the possession of another by evidence of an outstanding
title under which he does not claim.

In Willis v. Earl Howe[^/75] Kay, L. J., expressed the opinion that

>a continuous adverse possession for the statutory period, though by a
succession of persons not claiming under another, does, in my opinion,
bar the true owner.

But in Dixon v. Gayfere,[^/76] Romilly, M. R., held that as between
successive trespassers the law could not ascribe a title to any one
of them, neither to the first nor to the last nor to any intermediate
holder, and that the trespassers could not tack possessions which
were not continuous.[^/77] If the statute does run against the true
owner without privity, it will enure to the benefit of the first as
against the last or the intermediate trespasser.

In some Canadian cases it is said that the occupation of successive
trespassers, following each other without interruption, will be
sufficient to bar the true owner, although they are not in privity
with each other.[^/78] These cases are probably decided on what is
supposed to be the English rule, but there are other Canadian cases
holding the other way.

Among the American cases most frequently cited as dispensing
with privity are the Kentucky decisions of Shannon v. Kinny[^/79]
and Hord v. Walton.[^/80] In both of these Kentucky cases the first
holder yielded possession to the second by virtue of a judgment or
decree, so that the second holder had all the title of the first, and
more too. These cases are explained on that ground in the case of
Winn v. Wilhite,[^/81] which recognizes the rule that privity must
exist between adverse possessors, for one to acquire the benefit of
the occupation of the other, and to prevent a new cause of action
from arising.[^/82]

A Connecticut case frequently cited on this point is that of
Fanning v. Wilcox.[^/83] That case, also, is a case of recovery of
possession in an action of law, which is hardly equivalent to a new
disseisin. In Smith v. Chapin[^/84] it is said:

>Such continuity and connection may be effected by any conveyance,
agreement, or understanding, which has for its object a transfer of the
rights of the possessor, or of his possession, and is accompanied by a
transfer of possession in fact. Such an agreement to sell and transfer of
possession as were set up in this case, if proved, were sufficient.

It is accordingly the law of Connecticut that it is essential that
there be privity by conveyance, descent, recovery or delivery of
possession, in order that one may be the beneficiary of the prior
possession of another; and one who does not claim through or under
another may not rely on his possession.[^/85] Wishart v. McKnight[^/86]
is a leading Massachusetts case holding there may be privity by
delivery which would have warranted the finding that the possession
of each holder had been really transferred to his grantee, although
not included in the description of the deeds. It stands for
the proposition that "where possession has been actually and in
each instance, transferred by the one in possession to his successor,
the owner of the record title is barred."

In North Carolina[^/87] it was formerly held that privity of estate
was not required to be shown between different occupants in order
to presume a grant from the state, where land had been in adverse
use and occupation for thirty years. This rule has now been
changed by statute.[^/88] In Tennessee the presumption that the
state has parted with its title after the statutory period of twenty
years' continuous possession is still made without a showing of
privity.[^/89] But successive adverse possessions cannot aid each
other under the statute of limitations against a private owner unless
they are connected by contract or some form of legal privity.
Each subsequent possession not so connected takes a new start
unaided by the prior possession.[^/90]

A discussion of the requirement of privity on principle would
seem necessarily to involve the inquiry whether the entry of each
successive holder gives rise to a new right of action. For instance,
A may have held possession for a few days or years, without a
shadow of right, when B, another intruder, expels him and holds
for the balance of the statutory period, but not claiming under him.
When does the right of action against B, the second disseisor,
accrue: at the time that A dispossessed the owner and began to
withhold possession from him wrongfully and adversely, or at the
time of the entry of B? Is the owner's right of entry against A and
B the same cause of action?

It is assumed by Dean Ames in his classic article on Disseisin of
Chattels, or The Nature of Ownership, as it is later called, that
the right of recovery is the same right of action against each successive
disseisor, and that B holds possession subject to the same
defect as A, with the additional defect of a right of action in A.
This is, however, to assume the main question in issue. Actions
for the recovery of property are founded, (1) upon the plaintiff's
title and consequent right of possession; and (2) upon the defendant's
wrongful detention or withholding of possession.[^/91] In the
case of successive trespassers, each entry is to be regarded a fresh
and independent wrong. When the first trespasser makes his
forced abandonment of the land the right of action against him is
gone. A new and entirely distinct cause of action accrues to the
owner against each new intruder for the new interference with his
right of possession and the independent wrongful act of entry.
As the Supreme Court of Michigan said in Riopelle v. Gilman,[^/92]

>The right of action against any independent disseisor or intruder
must date back only to the origin of his possession; while if one succeeds
to another by transfer of title or claim, the right of action goes
back to the first occupant in the chain of adverse possession.

As Parker, J., says in Johnson & Sons v. Brock,[^/93]

>the old right of action was gone when the first intruder went out, and
that a new right of action arose when the fresh intrusion occurred.

When one purchases land from one exercising dominion over it,
he buys a title in the process of being quieted and protected by the
statute of limitations. A possessory title is thus a growing plant
becoming more and more firmly rooted in the soil. No title can
grow on this possession if the root is broken by ouster.

If there is privity between the successive occupants, the possession
of each is rooted to or engrafted upon the original entry, and
may be regarded as an outgrowth of the former possession.[^/94] On
the other hand there seems no reason why B, a trespasser, a casual
interloper, who drives A from possession, should get the benefit of
the time which has run in favor of the possession held by A. He
does not acquire the possessory title of his predecessor. It is not
necessary to consider the true owner as restored to constructive
possession, as his right of possession continues; and he may be regarded
as acquiring a new right of action against B, who by an
independent act invades his right, which he should be allowed a
new period of twenty years to pursue. But if there is privity,
there is a continuation of the disseisin, and the entry of the successor
"relates back" to the entry of him whose possessory right
he holds.[^/95] This is for the reason that he succeeds by transfer to
a possessory title already partly established. This substitution
does not make a new cause of action, and the successive possessions
blend into one. So the periods of adverse user of a way may be
tacked where there is privity between the successive claimants.
The consistent continued adverse user becomes conclusive evidence
of right.[^/96]

If the title of the true owner is extinguished by the possession
of independent trespassers, then the last of the trespassers can
defend his possession against the true owner, although he may still
be ejected by the first trespasser.[^/97] The statute will thus quiet a
title in favor of A, which is not being asserted or exercised by him
against the true owner, who has no right of action against A to
recover the possession. Why should the possession of a subsequent
trespasser enure to the benefit of a prior trespasser who is no longer
claiming title?

It may indeed be argued that, even where there is privity a new
cause of action accrues against each successive wrongdoer and
that the statute of limitations should always begin to run afresh.
This would prevent tacking even cases in which there is privity,
and it has been so held in England as to chattels, and in South
Carolina as to both chattels and land except in case of descent.[^/98]
It may be admitted that it does not necessarily follow, that because
the legislature has said that no action shall be brought against A
unless within twenty years after the cause of action accrues, that
therefore B cannot be sued in respect to an entry or conversion
made by him within twenty years. It may be difficult to show
that there is not a new cause of action against B, even though his
entry is by consent of A. In the case of chattels it would seem to
be a new conversion.[^/99] Barring a right of action against B is not
necessarily the result of a statute barring a right of action against A.
But the statute ought to receive "such a construction as will
effectuate the beneficent objects which it is intended to accomplish,
--- the security of titles and the quieting of possessions."[^/100]
Tacking may, if necessary, be explained as a common-law doctrine,
a limitation by analogy, because to hold otherwise would be contrary
to the policy of the statute and would prevent an adverse
holder from transmitting to another the benefit of his prior holding.
Where the same claim of title has been consistently asserted for
the statutory period by persons in privity with each other, there
is the same reason to quiet and establish the title as where one
person has held. The same flag has been kept flying for the whole
period. It is the same ouster and disseisin. If the statute runs,
it quiets a title which has been consistently asserted and exercised
as against the true owner, and the possession of the prior holder
justly enures to the benefit of the last.

If, on the other hand, the statute runs without privity, then
the first holder will have the better title among the successive
holders because of his prior possession, though he may have held
only a day. The relative priority of the inchoate titles will remain
unaffected by the extinguishment of the true owner's right. Title
will thus vest successively in the different holders, and only when
all the prior holders are barred will the last possessor gain an indefeasible
title to the land.[^/101] It seems unreasonable that either
the prior or subsequent independent holders should benefit by each
others' adverse possession. As a broad question of legislative policy,
however, it may perhaps be advisable to bar stale demands without
requiring proof of privity of estate between successive holders.

Where a statute of limitation requires action to be brought
within twenty years, or some other period after the owner or his
predecessor shall have been seised or possessed of the premises, a
different result may possibly be reached than where the statute
runs from the time when the right of action accrues. It was held
in Michigan,[^/102] under such a statute, that a party must bring his
action within twenty-five years after his disseisin, whether the
persons in possession claimed through or from each other or not.
The object of such a statute, it was said, is to compel every party
disseised to use some diligence and to bar a right of entry after
twenty-five years' practical abandonment of the possession to
strangers. This distinction, however, has not been followed in
other jurisdictions.
