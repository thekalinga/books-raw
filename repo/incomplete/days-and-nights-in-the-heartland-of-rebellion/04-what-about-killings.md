# What about Killings?

I posed many questions to my companions. I
told them about allegations that the party
kills people and burn their houses. That
people are killed at the slightest pretext for
being "informers". But in unison my
companions protested "we do not kill, loot or
rape". We help people. One of them, Chetu
said: "I come from south Dantewada where
_Salwa Judum_ did not spare girls and raped
them. They pick on helpless civilians. Why
don't they come and fight us instead of
killing villagers?" Sukhlal said that his
younger brother is in jail and kept in what is
known as "gola", that he is forced to remain
in sitting position with chains on his ankles
and wrists. He was in Dandkaranya _Adivasi_
_Kisan_ Mazdoor Sanghtana (DAKMS) and
that was his crime. Does this mean they
never kill? No that is not what we said, we
only kill 'enemy of the people'. But who are
these enemies of the people, I persisted? Is
anyone who opposes the party enemy of the
people? No, that is not true. For us it is not
important that you consider party your
enemy or oppose or criticize the party, but if
you side with government forces and work
with them then you are an enemy of the
people. I asked about the punishment meted
out to such people and got this response:
"We do not kill everyone who is considered
an enemy. Our party stops informers from
being killed. It is only when they do not
mend their ways despite repeated warnings
such persons are killed."

I remembered what General Secretary of the
CPI (Maoist) (GS) had said in his interview
given to Jan Myrdal and me in January
2010:

> ... in one of the extension areas,
there was an incident where in
collusion with the Inspector General
of Police, 33 members belonging to
two villages became agents of the
enemy. In this context our comrades
went and handled the issue. While
villagers wanted to give capital
punishment to the main agent of the
police, party interceded to give a
chance to that person to realize his
mistake.

Could there be a difference in the way in
which the party works in DK where it has its
own JS? Or is it merely selectively citing
cases where capital punishment was not
awarded? I don't know. But the more I think I
tend to believe that JS in DK could not have
survived and grown had they engaged in a
killing spree.

Sukhlal asked me if I saw the high-tension
wires.

"Yes", I said.

"Do you know that when people's militia in
this area blew some towers last year the
party called a meeting and criticized them
and told them this was wrong?"

"What did the party say and why did the
people's militia do it?", I asked

"Party told them that by doing so they were
affecting the poor in the cities who suffer
more than anyone else because the rich
have generators."

"So what did the members of people's militia
have to say?"

"They tried to justify it by saying that they
thought this was a good way to entice the
police to come with the repair team and then
ambush them."

"Did it mean that people's militia could
undertake ambushes on its own reckoning?"

"No, they would have informed PLGA."

"So, does the party avoid ambushes? Then
what about frequent talk of ambushes here
and there, land mine explosions and so
on?", I posed this to PLGA commander
Ramu.

He said that while they do organise
ambushes, each one is carefully planned
and takes time to plan because "we are
weaker than the enemy. We cannot afford to
strike at will and be reckless. We generally
avoid engaging the "enemy" unless we are
prepared. Also we believe in focusing on
such attacks that can get weapons." He said
that two people who were allegedly killed for
joining the army, few days ago, (21st
January 2010?) according to Union Home
Minister P Chidambaram speaking in
Raipur, that had nothing to do with us. We
do not know if such incident occurred in the
first place.

## What does it mean?

He said that party always owned up actions
carried out by them even if it went bad for
them, which is why people like me criticize
them. He added that they do consider this to
be "positive criticism", but that they cannot
do anything about incidents that are not their
doing. Referring to state harassment of
Himanshuji (of Vanvasi Chetna Ashram), he
said: "All these years we were accused of
harassing him. Now it is the State that has
demolished his ashram. We apologiese for
whatever we did wrong, but how can we be
blamed for killings that have nothing to do
with us.? We are in a period of strategic
defence and when we act it is not only a
military action but, as our GS told you, a
political and organizational leap forward.
Thus each action is planned."

"What about incidents of beheading or the
use of detonators on train in Jharkhand?", I
asked. "Were they planned?" "That was not
good for us", he said. And the party has
admitted its mistake. I pointed out that each
time they commit such a mistake and
apologise how does it help advance the
movement forward? Does it not raise
questions about indiscipline? "Look", he
said, "I know about DK but cannot speak
about other areas."

I raised questions about the killings of
CPI(M) party workers. Why was it necessary
to kill them? Were they corrupt and
oppressing people? Did the party go along
with people's demand for revenge? If not,
did they try to restrain the people by pointing
out that reckless killings will harm them
besides not winning them any friends? If
urban middle classes are wrong in shedding
tears over such killings how do they intend
to win them over to the side of the
revolution? If the soldiers of the revolution
cannot maintain discipline and abstain from
revenge killings how does the party intend to
win over the support of people? They
listened but warded off answers by saying
that we do not believe in mindless violence.
A senior leader to whom I threw all these
questions said that he couldn't answer
without reading the report of the relevant
state committee. It is good that they refused
to succumb to accepting criticism at face
value, even from one "quite supportive" of
them, without verifying facts. But what I did
note is that he did not dismiss my criticism.
When I told the senior leader that if the party
could not maintain discipline they ought to
re-think whether their forces are politically
equipped to fight a "people's war", he
inquired if this was my opinion or one shared
by others. When I said that I was sharing
what many felt, he nodded.

But I still wonder at what level does it get
decided when, where and how an action is
to be carried out. Does the party or the
squad decide it? If a squad carries out an
action without party's permission what
punishment is meted out? For instance, who
okayed the Jamui massacre of 17 February,
2010[^/7]? Or the use of detonators in the
Tata Bilaspur passenger train on November
27, 2009[^/8]? And why did the party fail to
restrain people from carrying out executions
in Lalgarh if the party was opposed to it?
Many a question I posed was listened to but
no response was forthcoming except that
they would certainly consider my criticism. I
was also told that disciplinary action is
always taken, though not everyone comes to
know of it. I did not get any wiser about the
specific incidents I raised and what was
done. But they also insisted that there was
no need to engage in Dandakaranya versus
Bihar--Jharkhand comparison and that I must
not jump to conclusions. Indeed some of
them appeared quite upset that I kept
bringing up these incidents that had
occurred in other areas. I agree I could be
wrong and, in Bihar, Jharkhand and West
Bengal, the movement, despite its different
histories, might be firmly anchored among
the people. However, many of the recent
incidents, which were reprehensible, had
occurred in Bihar--Jharkhand, Orissa and
West Bengal. Also unlike elsewhere JS had
taken roots amongst people with a history of
more than two decades in DK where the
party has been able to create an alternative
structure, virtually uncontested, over a
relatively long and more stable condition.
This allowed them to establish their
hegemony through consent rather than
coercion and this is reflected even in the
constitution of JS. It is this ideological
hegemony that is their source of strength
and sustainability. Of course I must enter a
caveat here that ideological hegemony could
as well be consensual even elsewhere
because of many other factors such as
reforms, party's unstinted work among the
most oppressed. ... But each area has a
different history of struggle. While I believe
that this could account for differences in the
experience and practice between DK and
other areas, how vast it is and whether this
creates vastly dissimilar conditions are
issues on which I suspend my judgment until
I have visited guerilla zones in Bihar and
Jharkhand.

Be that as it may. However, I was given a
copy of the public apology circulated by the
DK Special Zonal Committee party on April
28, 2009, addressed to the family of those
killed in a landmine explosion on April 16, 2009.
The poster-pamphlet reads:

>We know by saying sorry your dear
departed will not return nor our
apology wipe out your tears. But we
wish to tell you that our Party had no
animosity with your dear ones. It was
an accident. Government servants
including police men and ordinary
police personnel posted with
paramilitary formations are not our
enemy. ... You can then ask us why do
we attack police and paramilitary
forces? Why do we put land mines?
Or why do we have to use 'violence'?
In reality the system is responsible for
this. ... You know very well that every
peaceful agitation and struggle faces
_lathi-charge_ and bullets. We are
neither extremists nor terrorists as is
being propagated by this government
of exploiting classes. We are children
of workers, peasants and middle
classes. ... We are organizing people
in the backward tribal areas against
their exploitation and oppression so
that they can fight for their rights. ...

It goes on to point out that in and around
Singaram in south Bastar on 4 January,
2009, 19 _adivasis_ were killed, four of them
women. The women were gang raped first
and then killed. In West Bastar's Minkapalli,
six _adivasis_ were killed. Since 2005 at least
1,000 _Adivasis_ have been killed, hundreds
of women raped, 700 villages burnt.

>All this is being done to hand over mineral
wealth of DK forests to multinationals and
foreign capitalists. It is against this violence
we have been compelled to answer with
'violence'. Had we not resisted they would
have succeeded in their objective. Of course
_jawans_ in police and paramilitary forces
belong to ordinary peasant and worker
families or middle class families but they
have become tools in the hands of exploiters
and are attacking those amongst whom they
grew up. Killing, looting, raping, making
illegal arrests, taking bribes ... this is the
common practice of the police force. ... Many
a times we have distributed pamphlets
appealing to them not to attack poor and
exploited people. This is the context in which
we use land mines and attack police and
armed forces.

This is a far cry from the "we-said-so"
attitude of the die hard critics or "this
happens in class war" attitude of the die
hard supporters, both of whom are cut-off
from the everyday struggle while working
amongst people, the need to sift chaff from
grain and accept mistakes when they occur.
For all my pointed questions and at times
sledgehammer style, not once did they
counter by being dismissive. Although they
were cagey speaking about other areas they
were forthcoming about what they
themselves do in DK. Politics was in
command here, so to say. Therefore, to
distribute thousands of leaflets offering
public apology was a step in the right
direction. Because they know they are
accountable to the people and if they are to
be taken seriously then they have to act
responsibly.
