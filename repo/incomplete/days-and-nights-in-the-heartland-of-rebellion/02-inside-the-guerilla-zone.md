# Inside the Guerilla Zone

The first thing that strikes one entering a
guerilla zone in Bastar, where the Maoists
run their own government, Janatana _Sarkar_
(JS), is the form of greeting. Everyone, old
and young, men and women, villager or
party member, shakes hands, raises their
fist and greets you "Lal Salaam". The
second thing that strikes one is the number
of women in JS as well as in every platoon
or company of the Peoples' Liberation
Guerilla Army (PLGA) or People's Militia.
Many a platoon had a woman commander.
Indeed, the platoon that came to escort us
was led by a woman. They are not only in
command but carry out the riskiest tasks
too, just as men share equally with women
routine tasks such as collecting wood, water,
lighting fire, and cooking. It was quite
remarkable to see how in the platoons
women and men behaved with each other.
All of them carried up to 20--25 kg load
consisting of their weapons, rations and kit.
All were adept at stitching and sewing. In
fact, they were rather good at not just
repairing, but stitching their own kits in which
they carry their clothes, books, ammunition
magazines, and toiletries. When the strap of
my backpack broke, it was fixed by one of
the young men in the platoon. It was a neat
job. While the uniform was tailored inside
the "guerilla zone", shoes and toiletries were
bought from the market outside. Third thing
that strikes you is cleanliness. Water is
boiled. For latrines they dig a hole, some
distance away from the campsite, and my
companion Jan Myrdal was most impressed
because he said it reminded him of Swedish
military design for field toilets. Fourthly, but
most strikingly, no sooner their chores are
done, be it night or day, almost all the PLGA
members take out their books and read, or
take out their notebooks and write. Every
divisional JS brings out their own magazine
in Gondi/Koyam[^/6]. All in all, 25 magazines
are printed regularly in Dandakaranya (DK)
distributed inside. In fact, I saw screen-printing
of leaflets for the three-day _bandh_
from 25--27 January, 2010 a week before the
program. By and large, people don't have a
problem following reportage, where they do
get stuck is in analysis. Group discussions
are the way in which this problem is tackled.
An article is read out and everyone is
encouraged to explain what they understand
from it and through dialogue and
discussions, meaning and concept(s) get
explained and understood. Education is
prioritised and encouraged. Four textbooks
have been prepared by JS for students up to
fifth standard (maths, social science, politics
and Hindi) and four are under preparation
(history of DK, culture, biology and general
science).

Everyone takes turn at doing the chores,
from sentry duty to cooking. Since we were
guests from outside, we had more leeway.
But first thing they do is boil water. Once
they are done with their morning ritual, it is
time for Physical Training. By 8 am, they eat
their breakfast. Breakfast can vary between
"_poha_", "_khichri_" (rice and linseeds), etc.,
mixed with peanuts and is followed by tea.
Lunch and dinner consists of rice with dal
and _subzi_ (curry). Food is simple but
nutritious. Once a week they get meat.
Depending on availability, fish or pork is
provided by the Revolutionary Peoples
Committee. (An RPC is an elected body that
governs three to five villages. About 14--15
such RPCs make up an Area RPC. And 3--5
ARPCs constitute a Division.) Sometimes,
as for instance when I travelled to
Abujmaad, '_khichri_' with peanuts is all we
got. But it was simple, tasty and nutritious.
Of course with every meal we were offered
green chillies, which is considered a rich
source of vitamin C! Milk is scarce, so milk
powder is used for tea. Fruits such as
bananas and papayas are plenty in JS
areas. There is no fixed time for sleeping but
invariably by 10 pm everyone would retire
for the night. Camps are never in the same
spot, it keeps shifting. A plastic sheet is
spread and people cover themselves with
blanket/s and sleep. For us, their guests, a
shawl was spread on the plastic sheet and
over our heads another plastic sheet was
spread to protect against heavy morning
dew. We were served tea in bed when we
woke up. While the forest was used for daily
rituals, over years they have honed their
skills and shit-holes are dug and then
covered before shifting camps.

People watch select movies. When I was
there two films were shown, on popular
demand (I was told) --- "Rang de Basanti"
and "Mangal Pandey". However, this is
possible only when some relatively senior
party man with a laptop visits them. Laptop,
you ask? How do they charge laptops? Well
every company, if not platoon, has solar
panels that are used to power lights,
computers and so forth. TV programs and
debates were downloaded from youtube and
copied and circulated amongst the
companies. I was surprised to know that
many a debate in which I was featured had
already been watched. Some thought that I
looked healthier on screen! But of course,
the all time favourite was Arundhati Roy.
She spoke English, so how did you all follow
her, I asked. Turns out that some of the
senior comrades translated what she had to
say for the benefit of others. I was asked a
lot of questions about her. Yes, she has
quite a fan following inside the jungle too!
Radio was listened to and PLGA personnel
like to listen avidly to a radio program, which
carries special Hindi film songs played as
requested by the "_faujis_" (soldiers). But their
all time favourite is the BBC news which is
heard by everyone, every morning and
evening. Local radio news is followed for
negative reportage with a view that
reporting, even negative, is news. In a
platoon nearly every third person had a
radio. Newspaper and magazines reach
them after several days. Books are mostly
downloaded from net. Yes, there are places
with Internet access. The rest is human
ingenuity. At night, solar powered lights
come in handy for people to gather around
and read. Or sit around the fire and chat.

What about alcohol and smoking? After all
tribal people in Bastar brew their own drinks.
Sulfi and Mahua are quite common. It was
quite interesting that while the party does
not allow opening of IMFL shops in JS area
they do not stop brewing of traditional
drinks. But seldom does a party member
drink. It is expected of party members that
they neither drink nor smoke. Although
_tendu_ leaves are available in plenty, they do
not prohibit but actively discourage smoking.
And the JS conducts propaganda
campaigns against smoking and drinking.
When I visited I was told that two people will
publicly announce that they are quitting
smoking and encourage others to follow suit.
It was interesting for me to note that not one
person in the camp, or the platoon which
accompanied me, smoked or drank.
