# A Hurried and Much Too Short a Meeting

As I was returning from Maad I met
Comrade Lenj in charge of CNM in DK along
with Chandru a leading member of Chetna
Natya Manch. I had read Comrade Lenj's
interview in Peoples March years ago. There
is a range of activities in which they are
engaged. He told me, time was short and he
had to reach long way from where we were
before disk falls. So I asked him what the
changes are since your interview appeared
in Peoples March (August--September
2006). He told me that their membership has
since grown to 10,000 plus members. One
of the major tasks they were engaged in
currently was to write a history of 30 years of
cultural work in DK. Their work involves
literature, plastic art, music and dance. Their
members have composed 204 songs in last
two years. "Jhankar" carries stories written
by their own members. They use the form of
street theatre to stage plays. I asked them
about themes of their songs? It is
propaganda, such as satire or parody (they
had used popular Hindi song from Bunty and
Babli and used it as a parody of Mahendra
Karma although they said that they use film
tunes selectively and that too only for
parody), philosophy to teach dialectical
materialism, political campaign against
_Salwa Judum_ etc. They use traditional
instruments as well as others and even
trying to use KiKirh which they said was like
an early version of violin. They produce their
own music cassettes and have a mobile
editing unit. But he said that much of what
he said in the interview still remained valid.
Following extracts are relevant:

>We impart training to all members of CNM.
>Children from the age of 10 years to elders
>are members of CNM. We invite them to
>special camps according to their activities
>and enthusiasm. We are trying to teach
>marching songs, songs with simple words to
>increase scientific thinking and dances to
>children. We are concentrating more on
>young men and women. We are facing
>severe police repression in giving training.
>Especially it is a big problem to give training
>in places like Gadchiroli (Maharashtra).
>
>We go to the villages and mobilize the CNM
>members. We fix a schedule of 4, 5 days or
>two days according to ... agriculture works,
>wage earning or collection of forest produce
>works. We participate in production work
>along with them and give them training. We
>don't teach them many songs, dances, steps
>or instruments at one go. We teach one
>song or a dance or an instrument one at a
>time. We give training by keeping in view
>their talents, interests and learning capacity.
>This is giving good results. Some times we
>are teaching them to write songs also as
>part of training. For example we held a five
>day training camp in South Bastar in 2002.
>We concentrated on encouraging them to
>write. The people here are experts in singing
>songs extempore ...
>
>The instruments of DK are very ancient.
>There are 18 kinds of them. Only a few are
>in use now. We are using these instruments
>and also some modern ones. The
>importance of instruments cannot be
>underestimated. We did not put any
>restrictions that only the local instruments
>should be used. We are using a combination
>of various instruments. Music should not
>dominate the song and its lyrics. So we are
>using modern and local instruments
>according to the needs of the performance
>and in a way that it is enhanced. The main
>ones are the "_Dappi_" (a percussion

>Jhankar (CNM periodical) was started in
>July--August 1994 ... Comrades write in
>Gondi, Hindi, Marathi, Bengali and Telugu in
>this magazine, this is another special feature
>of Jhankar. They can write in whatever
>language they feel they can express
>(themselves). There are _adivasis_, non
>_adivasis_, Bengalis, Telugus, Marathis and
>Oriya i.e. people belonging to various areas
>and nationalities in the DK movement now.
>So Jhankar is a multi lingual magazine. We
>are trying to make writers not only out of
>people but out of cadres also. ... They
>express excellently all their problems,

>publishing their writings and developing

But there was one thing I was also keen to
ask him. This was to do with the discussion
within the party on Gondi script. We were
told that right now they were using devnagri
script, same as used for Hindi, to write
Gondi. However, they were now veering
round to the view that Gondi must have its
own separate script. Why, asked Jan
Myrdal. He said that even his own mother
tongue Swedish uses roman alphabets but
has added three alphabets which enable
sounds specific to Swedish to be used.
Advantage with this is that by retaining a
common alphabet there is scope for cross-cultural
interaction and learning. If there had
been a separate script for Swedish this
separateness could have fed isolation. I
concurred with him. But we were told that
this may be true but only partially. There are
many sounds absent, such as "gh" or "sh".
Thus if people have a script of their own in
which their own special sounds and
intonations can be expressed, they will find it
easier to identify with it because the
representation i.e. alphabets, are easier pick
up and faster to learn. Will not this enable
people to communicate across cultural
boundaries? The point is not whether they
are right or wrong; it is more that the
projected image of a militarized and violent
Maoist does not match the reality of
members engaged in a variety of cultural,
economic, political and social subject matter
of concern.
