# White Terror

By the end of the 1980s, peasant and
women's organisations in DK were operating
at the zonal level which encompassed tribal
areas across states, and recruitment to
people's militia was on the rise. Villagers
reposed confidence in DAKMS as their own
organization, and since tribals traditionally
had the practice of participating collectively
every villager began participating in it. Sonu
said, "(t)he old tradition of collective
participation of the _adivasis_ was exploited by
the party in the initial years for the purpose
of the revolution. Now that they themselves
started understanding the advantages of
organisation and the party, it raised the
consciousness level of the people to the
extent that they could clearly demarcate the
contradiction between the people and the
chiefs as well as the people and the state.
So, the alignment also was very clear to
them. The chiefs sided with the state, while
the party and people came together." There
was a growing realization accordingly
among the people, that if they needed to
maintain their right over the land, then they
would have to organize themselves and
fight. Or else, the state and the chiefs would
seize no opportunity to grab it back. "So the
party gave the direction that if you organise
and arm yourself then you will be able
protect your right." There was a spurt in
recruitment to the party as a consequence.

But state repression was also increasing. It
was around this time in 1990--91 that the first
_Jan Jagran Abhiyan_ was launched by the
Madhya Pradesh state government. As the
tribal chiefs lost their land and traditional
status, and DAKMS started replacing them,
"so naturally, the state and tribal chiefs
colluded in organising the first white terror
campaign in 1990--91 in the form of _Jan
Jagaran Abhiyan_." In 1991, repression
started in Gadchiroli in Maharashtra and
Bastar region in Madhya Pradesh. Dozens
of party members were killed between 1991--1994.
Sukhlal, who was from a village in
Gadchiroli, told me that his village was
attacked 15 times. He was then in his early
teens. It was at this time, said Sonu, that the
party took the decision to fight against the
state and guerilla zones started being
developed. By now all village problems were
being referred to the DAKMS, and both the
traditional chieftains and the government
panchayat system were losing ground. "This
was a form of power transfer in clearest
terms". Even the _patwaris_ stopped coming to
the village for revenue collection. However,
the party observed a power vacuum and
realised that DAKMS could not fill this
vacuum. By 1994, the decision to create
people's power organs was formally taken
and in 1995 an All India Special Conference
was held where the party ratified the
decision of building power organs called
"Gram Rajya Committees", a body elected
by all villagers above the age of 18 whose
main focus was to concentrate on
development of agriculture.

As the _Mukhias_' traditional privileges and the
government's panchayat system began
receding and embryonic forms of people's
power emerged a clash between the two
powers was inevitable. As people's power
consolidated, the state reacted with a
second 'white terror' campaign in the name
of '_Jan Jagran_' in 1997. In this campaign
many local comrades were tortured, many
houses burnt and people threatened into
surrendering. One comrade, for instance,
had been killed publicly in a public meeting
creating an atmosphere of terror. But did not
the party also develop a military force at the
level of squads and carry out actions? Yes,
they did. One Masa of village Vedire was
said to be a cruel and notorious village chief
and he was eliminated as the people's
enemy. Thus, selected people were killed.
This phase lasted for six to eight months.
However, the attack which started on June
5, 2005 in the name of '_Salwa Judum_' was
qualitatively different both in extent and
scope from the last two '_Jan Jagran_'
campaigns. While the two '_Jan Jagrans_' had
been largely organised at a local level, this
one was the product of coordinated planning
from the local through the state to the
Centre. Both the state police and central
paramilitary forces along with the local level
_Salwa Judum_ gangs were unleashed on the
people with a long-term perspective.

The development and strengthening of the
people's movement since 2004, after the
formation of CPI (Maoist), had made them
the primary target of the State since the
emergence of a united party enabled them
to mount a formidable resistance to
corporate takeover of forest land. Although
there was a noticeable shift in Indian
government's stance towards _Naxalites_ by
1998, when under the leadership of L K
Advani, the then Home Minister of the BJP-led
National Democratic Alliance _Naxalites_
and Maoists were deemed as posing a
threat to "internal security". However, the
Congress party led United Progressive
Alliance (UPA) government under
Manmohan Singh which came to power in
2004 identified the Maoist party as the
"single biggest internal security threat"
facing the country. This, despite the fact that
in 2004--05 Maoists had been dealt a severe
blow in Andhra Pradesh where they lost,
according to party estimates, 1800 cadres.
The anti-Maoist operations in AP had picked
up in October 2004 and carried on
throughout 2005. Coincidentally, _Salwa
Judum_ formally started in June 2005, but it
was preceded by months of preparation.
(See the report, _When the State Makes War
on Its Own People; Violation of People's
Rights during the Salwa Judum_, April 2006,
brought out by APDR, IAPL, PUCL and
PUDR: www.pudr.org). Thus, _Salwa Judum_
was a pre-meditated, coordinated and
planned assault to stem any consolidation of
people's power which held out the biggest
challenge to implementation of MOUs
signed by Chattisgarh, Orissa and
Jharkhand governments with mineral
extraction and mineral based industries.

Starting from June 5, 2005 and up to
December 2005, the terror campaign was at
its peak. Two blocks of Bhairamgarh and
Bijapur were selected for maximum assault
and in the whole process at least 644
villages were destroyed and people
displaced. As per government records,
350,000 were displaced. According to Sonu,
only 56,000 of them, who had been kept in
33 "concentration camps or what they call
relief camps" have been accounted for.
Another 35,000 tribals sought refuge in AP.
The government is yet to account for the
rest. Sonu said that the "majority of people
are with us". The people who have been
forced into the camps lead a miserable life,
while the villagers who dared to return to
their own villages still largely live in jungles
as the repression in the form of
indiscriminate loots, killings and rapes
continued.

## So what did the party do?

Starting in January 2006, a concrete
planned campaign against _Salwa Judum_
was taken up. While the party began its
campaign against _Salwa Judum_, the state
propaganda of projecting it as an
independent and spontaneous movement of
the people and as some kind of a
democratic revolution had been thoroughly
exposed. It was clearly a battle for _adivasi_
survival. The party called the people to join
the militia for survival. And as part of that the
Koya Bhoomkal Militia was formed in 2006
and inaugurated on February 10, 2006, thus
linking it to the Bhoomkal uprising of 1910.
According to the party thousands of people
joined the militia to fight for their life and
existence against _Salwa Judum_. "The
people, the PLGA, the party, the mass
organisations and the campaigns in the
national and international levels came
together in the shape of a big movement for
which the party is grateful to the democratic
forces of the country." In their assessment,
SJ was halted by May--June 2006.

According to Sonu, _Salwa Judum_ was the
product of a state, which was eager to loot
the natural resources of this region. With the
coming of BJP to power in 2004, by 2005
hundreds of MOUs had been signed. For
instance, the Texas Power Generation
Company had invested 5000 crores in
Chattisgarh. In Lohandiguda, Tata had
acquired enormous lands and so did Jindal
in Bansi. Ultimately, it became a question of
existence for the _adivasi_ community and as
experience shows the Bailadilla mines that
had started as early as 1970 was profiting
Japan while continuously hampering _adivasi_
life and culture. This policy to acquire natural
resources is the gravest danger haunting the
_adivasi_ communities. "Manmohan Singh
calls the Maoists as the biggest danger, but
the real threat is being faced by the _adivasis_.
That is why people came forward in large
numbers and resisted _Salwa Judum_. In fact
people as far as Nagaland and Mizoram
protested the deployment of their kith and
kin such as in Naga and Mizo battalion/s in
this area".

By October 2009, the architects of _Salwa
Judum_ had to finally give a public statement
annulling _Salwa Judum_. However, the _Salwa
Judum_ was, according to the party only the
first phase of a war and as this terror
campaign failed, "the state began mobilising
its repressive resources and another wave
of intensification of the assault on the people
is now being seen in the form of operation
green hunt". In the _Salwa Judum_ phase,
18,000--20000 forces were deployed. Today
there are more than 200,000 security forces
who have been massed against the Maoists.
The SPOs of the _Salwa Judum_ are now
known as Koya Commandos. And so
Operation Green Hunt is nothing but an
extension of _Salwa Judum_. Besides, such
campaigns are not unique to DK.
Sendra/Shanti Senas have been created in
Jharkhand, Bihar and Orissa.

"So from Lalgad to Surjagad", said Sonu,
"this entire _adivasi_ belt with all its wealth and
natural resources, although projected as the
Red Corridor, is in reality a mineral corridor.
They (State) feel threatened by the rising
people's power in this region, therefore, they
are launching one offensive after another.
Due to the failure of _Salwa Judum_, now we
see Operation Green Hunt. To conclude,
white terror had started in 1990--91 after
which we decided to form people's
government which was followed by the
second white terror in 1997. And after this,
we gave concrete shape to the people's
power by consolidating the RPCs. Then
came _Salwa Judum_ and since then, we have
progressed to area level organs of state
power and through all these years, militarily
we have moved from platoons to
companies, and are now moving towards
battalion formation."
