# Collateral Damage

Ramakrishna Mission (RKM) runs five
schools, called Vivekanand Vidya Mandirs,
inside Abujmaad area of Bastar. These are
located in Akabeda, Irrakbhatti, Kachchapal,
Kundla and Kutul. They also ran health
centres and fair price shops at these places.
The schools operate, as of now, but fair
price shops have been shut down and the
health centres now provide skeleton service.
Earlier a doctor used to visit the health
centre every Wednesday but since 2005 this
has been discontinued. Why? Because the
administration claims that medical facilities
were also availed by the Maoists and the
doctor was treating _Naxals_. When I asked
whether the Mission office-bearers informed
the administration that not only is it not a
crime to treat anyone, but that there is a
Supreme Court order which says that no one
can be denied medical help simply because
he/she is accused of being an
extremist/terrorist? The wry response was
that this might be true but there is a distance
of several thousand kilometers between the
Supreme Court and where they are.

In practical terms this means that there is
economic blockade, which is an act of war,
imposed in the war zone and thus no
supplies (i.e., ration or medicines) can enter,
for instance, the interior region of Maad. To
ensure that rations and other supplies are
controlled, weekly _haat_ earlier held in civilian
areas, have been shifted to armed camps.
This means that entry and exit of civilians
are regulated. I was told by a member of the
RKM school staff, who feared that he could
get into trouble were his name mentioned,
that since September 2008 they require a
special pass for traveling, which is
authorized and signed by the
Superintendent of Police, Narayanpur. At the
checkpost, on exiting they are obliged to
record their names, where they are headed
and why. On entry, they have to show what
supplies they are carrying, whether it is in
accordance with the _challan_, and are then
searched. At the camps where they buy
provisions they have to record, as do the
villagers, how many members there are and
then rations are provided. At the camps they
are also vulnerable since it is frequented by
the dreaded SPOs at whose mere words
any person can be picked up, beat, thrown
into jail and maybe released only after
paying a bribe. I was told of an incident
where two milk sellers were picked up at the
behest of SPOs and then the officer in-charge
asked them for Rs. 2000 as bribe to
set them free. They had only Rs. 500
between them so as a show of magnanimity
the officer of the camp took Rs. 500 and let
them go with a warning that they better
remain "good citizens" and not believe
anything Maoists tell them. I asked the
villagers how they get their ration. Most of
them said that they don't like traveling
because of the harassment as also because
the ration they are allowed is always much
less than what they are entitled to buy
because they are told that they were taking
it for Maoists/_Naxalites_. On approaching the
camp, they say they have to walk in a single
file through a fenced corridor. The RKM
personnel too said that they have to get
down from their vehicle even when their
'_maharaj_' returns after a visit. "Why don't you
complain", I asked? They said they had to
be careful. "If we complain we are told 'you
are talking like a _Naxalite_' and asked to shut
up. If we persist, we are told that 'we know
about your links with _Naxalites_ and we are
keeping an eye on you. Don't act too
smart'". I asked, "what about the _Naxalites_,
don't they scare you?" They said, "after the
initial years when we faced problems from
them, they have not bothered us. They
have, in fact, even stopped visiting us at our
request when we told them we are being
accused of being _Naxalites_ by the
authorities." "Don't they ask for help?" "No,
they said because they know that our
provisions have been slashed and health
centre and fair price shop closed. Party has
told us that they will not interfere, so long as
we do not allow armed police to camp in the
schools premise."

In fact, he said that one of the charges
leveled by officials against us is: "how come
RKM schools operate but not the
government run schools". I said, yes, I too
am intrigued. He asked, "Have you seen
what the government schools are like?
Some of them are not fit to be called
schools. Just see what they are like and
remember the fact that most of the teachers
draw salary even when they stay away from
attending schools." I asked if Maoists do not
threaten them, to which he said, "Look, you
will get me into trouble, but all I will say is
that if a person can draw salary by doing
nothing, by simply using the excuse that
_Naxalites_ threaten him, and the
administration finds this useful fodder for
their propaganda against _Naxalites_, claiming
they do not allow government schools to
run, then what conclusions does one draw?"
But he also added: "I would not blame the
teachers, he said, because some of the
schools are only schools in name." I asked
him about the claim that in the last four
years 385 residential schools have been
destroyed by _Naxalites_ in Bastar and if he
knew anything about this. He smiled before
turning away, "I did not know there were that
many schools in Bastar." I was no wiser, but
did not pester him anymore. I was reminded
of a story that had appeared in the Indian
Express (5 December, 2009 New Delhi
edition) which quoted a personnel of Naga
Armed Force deployed in Tamar (ST)
Constituency during the recent Jharkhand
elections as saying: "We had heard that this
area was the den of Maoists. We did not see
them anywhere. But the schools where we
were lodged were full of mosquitoes. There
was no potable water. We used to drink
water from the hand pump after boiling, but
(even) this did not help." Those who lament
destruction of schools and shed tears over
the plight of soldiers having to live in such
sub-human conditions should maybe spare
a thought for school children who are
supposed to be taught in such miserable
conditions. If, in addition, these are used as
camps for military personnel, wherein lies
the responsibility?

Returning from there, I could also not help
thinking about how in a war zone the very
act of standing up to a person in authority is
considered disobedience, which they do not
countenance. And yet, there was so much I
got to know from the guarded remarks of the
RKM personnel! It is certain that RKM is
under tremendous pressure. However, what
I did not fathom is that why is it that those
who believe in God were scared of mortals
holding out threats or trying to pressure
them into submission? Do their material
possessions make them vulnerable to
government's arm-twisting? I mean, if
'serving the people' is their call in the service
of their Gods why is it that senior
office-bearers of the RKM, or for that matter
Christian and other missionaries do not
protest cutbacks in medicine or closure of
fair price shops in war-zones?
