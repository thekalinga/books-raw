# What Do I Believe?

What is my overall impression? How do I
read the Maoist movement in DK?

I am convinced that this war will be unlike
any other war which Indian government has
waged in the last 63 years. That this is one
war which will test the resilience of the
Indian state as it has never been done
before. Precisely because it is a war in
which people are fighting in their own
territory to save their land, forest, water,
minerals, from being grabbed and they are
convinced that they have an alternate vision,
not just for themselves, the _adivasis_, but for
Indian people as a whole. It is a different
ballgame altogether when a people feel that
destiny beckons them to emancipate
themselves in order that they can inspire
fellow country men and women to rally
around them and follow their example.

However, no movement in India has so
much to its credit and yet so little written
about it or so much abuse hurled at them.
Far less than this gets talked about and
celebrated. Those of us, who believe in
'liberty with equality', must rejoice at the
remarkable strides Maoists have taken and
in showing us how far the spirit of "serve the
people" can take us. They are not saints,
certainly not sinners, but as mortals they
have shown what an unflinching
commitment to bring about social
transformation actually means. Critics can
find faults, magnify them, over-read them,
rulers can try to "eliminate", "cripple" and
"choke", to use the words employed by the
PM, to wipe them out, but it is not possible
to deny that they are rooted among people,
they survive because of this, and they are
expanding politically because poor and
deprived believe in them. Its not only
Maoists reaching out to people but people
are reaching out to them and inviting them to
enter new areas, to assist them in their
everyday struggles. Therefore, I believe that
whether they are dealt a setback or lose
their base or bases here or there, this
movement is not going to be obliterated. I
think that if they are pushed from one area
they will sprout elsewhere. This is the
significance of their claim that they are
thinking in terms of 50--60 years and not just
here and now. They are here to stay. This
represents a significant shift.

So, one should not belittle their
achievement. All the more because while
scholars and activists talk about alternative
development models and paradigms, here
are Maoists who have been practicing it for
last thirty years among millions of Indians.
And not only are they developing agriculture,
introducing social and economic reforms,
debating social mores but are engaged in
working out their own take on
industrialization, mining. ... Yes it is small
step when you consider the vast canvas of
India. But is there any other political
formation which has come anywhere close
to what they have achieved against this
many odds?

Ironically, whatever document one was
given to read or conversation we had was
invariably punctuated with their admission of
many a shortcoming or mistake or
weakness. .While I consider them honest
admission I believe these are highly
exaggerated. One of the things which stuck
me was that unlike elsewhere where people
tend to over blow their achievement here
party was being modest about them.
Constantly talking about the problems they
face or what needed to be done. For
instance when I asked why is it that there is
so little written material in shape of
travelogue, reportage, party documentation
etc on DK movement? There are few books
available in Hindi, even these are translated
from Telugu or Punjabi, and there is booklet
brought out by the party on the development
work in DK which is available in English and
Hindi. But these are few and far in between.
P Shankar's book "_yeh jungle hamara hai_"
(This Forest Belongs to Us) needs updating
since it was written in 1997 in Telugu and
later translated into Hindi. Somehow the
answer was that they never got round to
doing this. Why? Did they not know that their
detractors have used this knowledge deficit
to malign them?

Yes, they did especially when in the initial
period of _Salwa Judum_ they were blamed for
bringing "white terror" upon themselves.
They were accused of having stopped
_adivasis_ from plucking _tendu_ leaf. Whereas
"the truth was that we were opposed to
government announced price of less than
â‚¹50 for a bundle of 50 leaves when private
contractors were offering nearly double the
rates. That was the period when we realized
that some intellectuals were leveling
charges against us by believing whatever
was told them in the _Salwa Judum_ camps."
But why did they not publicize their
achievement? Here they were practicing
alternate 'development' enriching _adivasi_
society be it in terms of economic activities,
health, education, development of their
language (developing a new script) and
preserving tribal culture. ... Why did they not
encourage more write ups on their
experience and work in DK? I could not find
satisfactory answer; I was met with shy
smiles.

My own take is that for years DK was seen
as an adjunct to the movement in AP. By the
time it took roots and organs of people's
power began to consolidate nearly two
decades had passed. It was around the turn
of this millennium that serious efforts were
made to invite writers to come, visit and
write. This picked up with the formation of
CPI (Maoists) with significant presence in
several states and setback experienced in
AP.

The remarkable thing is that party in DK is
strongly located among the poor _adivasis_
and women. The advantage of entering an
area which had been overlooked by the
Indian State for decades, where political
parties were marked by their absence,
proved to provide the Maoists with a
tremendous advantage. This they seized
and as a result the progress made, the
utilization of resources and how far it went against
Indian State's record where 12 paise
for every rupee allocated reaches the
people, here nearly every penny serves the
people --- the frugality of life of party members
in DK as well as the PLGA, the backbone of
the movement, makes evident a fact that
collective work and commitment to serve the
people can make even limited resources go
very far. I did not probe whether they
debated while utilizing resources the choice
between equity and efficiency or how did
they resolve it, but it was evident to naked
eyes that emphasis was on reaching out to
as many as possible with minimum of
wastage. The way in which every scrap of
paper was saved and used was an everyday
reminder. Every scrap was used for
scribbling a message, instruction or
requirement. Life remains tough and
Spartan. The problems the party faces are
mounting: on the one hand offensive as well
as encirclement by the State and on the
other loss of human and material resources.

However, the point is that while they face
problems they also exaggerate their
weaknesses. If one reads, for instance, the
party document on rectification being carried
out by them it reveals that most examples
they cite are probably drawn from outside
DK and most likely AP. Let me illustrate:

a) In some areas, the lands occupied from
landlords in the past are lying fallow due to
government repression; when the landlords
try to sell these lands, the rich peasants and
middle peasants are purchasing them. On
such occasions, instead of bringing pressure
through the agricultural labourers and poor
peasants, who occupied those lands, on
those who purchased the lands and
stopping the sales, the squads themselves
have been thrashing the rich and middle
peasants who purchased the lands.
b) In the struggle for the eradication of bad
habits like liquor consumption, educating the
people with a long term view is lacking; in
the struggle to obstruct the manufacture of
arrack, instead of rallying the people,
especially the women, prominence is being
given to squad actions only. Physical
punishments are being imposed
disregarding class basis.
c) When problems arise in man-woman
relations, especially in matters relating to
marriage, judgments are being given without
taking into view, the social problems women
face.
d) In various kinds of people's 'Panchayats'
instead of listening to the versions of both
sides apart from gathering the needed
information from others in the villages also,
one sided judgments are being - delivered,
under the effect of sectarianism.
e) When some among the people commit
mistakes, when they oppose our mass
organisations, or when they are suspected
to be working as informers, punishments
much beyond their wrongs are being
imposed ...

Now squads have given way to platoons,
companies and now they are talking of
battalions. In Bastar where land was
distributed the ousted landlords have not
been able to either sell or take possession of
their lands expropriated from them and
distributed to poor _adivasis_ by JS. This is
opposite to what happened in AP. In AP
land which was distributed lay fallow and
attempts were made to sell them off which
was thwarted through squad action. Indeed
during the peak of SJ these lands may have
remained fallow, but by now _Adivasi_
peasants have begun to return to cultivate
the lands, and size of the land which
remains fallow has shrunk. Also in Bastar,
JS extends credit and seeds to poor
peasants and loans to purchase pair of
bullocks provided to poor peasants to
encourage them to take to ploughing their
fields rather than using shovels to plough
the land. Besides, in DK's JS areas there
are no arrack shops and only traditional
liquor is brewed. Therefore, mobilizing
women against arrack shops, so effective in
early phase of the movement in AP, is not
needed here. Indeed incidence of
drunkenness is far less. Punishment meted
out is not in excess of mistake committed. In
fact people are proud that ordinary crimes
have reduced. Finally, an _adivasi_ comrade
said that in AP, unlike here in DK, party
members had become little lazy. I said
really. He said here in DK we do all the work
ourselves; even carry our supplies and even
when we fetch it from the _haat_ everyone has
to chip in to carry it. In AP people would use
their mobile and place order and provisions
would arrive either in tractor or jeep. He said
they exposed themselves to informers and
infiltration.

Could these mistakes cited in the document
on Rectification allude to what went wrong in
AP, a way to remind the cadres to be aware
of such mistakes and to avoid them? That is
what I think. Indeed such is the influence
and trust in the party in DK that despite the
best efforts of CPI local leaders, who have
begun to bad mouth Maoists and warning
people that they will be arrested or harassed
if they do not cease supporting Maoists in
Lohandiguda, CPI's _Adivasi_ Mahasabha has
not managed to entice many peasants to
sell their land to Tatas at higher rate of
compensation. This is quite a change from
CPI's attitude until recently where A B
Bardhan, general secretary of CPI spoke of
'operation greenhunt' as a policy to
'exterminate communists' and "all those who
hold the red flag high".(See The Tribune, 5
October, 2009)

It can also be observed in the way in which
Maoists are looked upon as the only force
on the ground fighting for _Adivasis_ in Bastar,
and this cuts across party affiliations. It does
not mean that there is hundred %
identification with everything Maoists preach
or practise. Only that in the eyes of the
people they are legitimate and a force they
can trust. This has to be seen in its
perspective. Imagine an area where corrupt
and oppressive forest department was
driven away, struggle for decent wages was
fought, land reforms were brought about,
where the Party continues to anchor itself
among the poor and the most deprived
especially the women, and struggles with
them to ensure that people's dignity and
honour is not compromised, their culture
prospers, where they stand by the most
oppressed. ... It is then one realizes why
Maoists are looked upon as their own by
most _Adivasis_. It is quite remarkable that the
virulent tone of urban intellectuals is shared
by that section of _Adivasis_, which earlier
wielded power over their own ethnic
brethrens and who have gotten marginalized
in the course of 30 years of Maoist
movement. This does not qualify to claim
that _Adivasis_ are caught between State and
Maoists, particularly, when Maoists are
themselves _Adivasis_! Indeed charge of
"outsiders" appears ridiculous when one
remembers that aliens are the security
forces, bureaucrats, police officers,
corporate honchos ...

One question which kept on coming up was
how does the Maoist movement plan to
move from here, their forest stronghold, into
the world outside?

We were told in the interview given to us by
the GS that this " is definitely a challenge
before us but we are confident that there is
an advantage in the long run which cannot
be achieved in a short period. But unlike
what the enemy wants, to finish this in a
short period, we want to stretch this war and
transform the situation to our advantage
favorable to the revolution." From what was
said I gathered that they expect to expand
rapidly in the course of this war, which they
argue has been thrust upon them. As it
happened during the two '_jan jagrans_' and
the SJ, they believe that if they are able to
protect their core, no matter how many
reverses they may encounter, they will be in
a position to sprout elsewhere. How realistic
is this assessment? It is one thing to say,
which they do in Strategy and Tactics of
Indian Revolution that "(w)hatever the forms
assumed by the revolutionary wars in
various countries, the content remains the
same i.e. the seizure of power by armed
forces", but quite another to first reach there.
Let me explain. I consider the argument
about violence and non-violence to be
unreal and esoteric mumb-jumbo. I defend
the right of people to offer armed resistance
because it is legitimate to fight oppression
any which way. Also I think that unless
people are armed there is no other way one
can neutralize the great advantage the ruling
classes enjoy over means of violence, which
is primarily employed against the masses. It
is worth remembering that there are,
according to International Action Network on
Small Arms, an estimated 40 mn private
weapons in India.[^/8] It does not require
rocket science to believe that these tens of
millions of weapons are mostly in the
possession of those who wield power and
are privileged? This reality, and an India,
which for all its verbosity about non-violence,
is one of the most heavily armed
state both in terms of accumulation of
destructive power of its arsenal as well as
size of its military force, which gets force
multiplied by draconian laws, and thus
enables the ruling classes to practice 'slow
genocide'. Harsh words, but not necessarily
misplaced if one considers that 45% of
children below 6 years suffer from
malnutrition, malnourishment and stunted
growth, or that by playing around with
calorie intake, from 2400 to 1500--1800, one
can statistically reduce the number of people
living below poverty line and thus reduce
Food Security entitlement for hundreds of
millions of Indians! This exposes our own
people to a slow death.[^/9] To then argue
that violence has no role to play or that it
has no emancipatory value is, therefore,
quite wrong. It is as good telling people to
wait patiently for the fruit to fall into their lap.
This may be touching display of fortitude
and of religious faith, but for the fact those at
the receiving end may be getting desperate
after 63 years of practising it. Recall that,
even the State, which fights the Maoists,
does not deny that Maoists represent the
"poorest among the poor". Could it be that
class operates even here when one
considers the fact that middle class youth
rebels of 1960s vintage who recanted are
eulogied but the oppressed who join the
Maoists today are pilloried.

Point is, so long as State monopolises
means of violence they will remain enabled
to subject people to life of indignity and
enslavement. Freedoms and liberties are
prerogatives of middle classes to enjoy.
Working people are exposed to repressive
freedom; no sooner they appear to have
succeeded in mobilizing people and begin to
question the inequalities and inadequacies
in the system they become target of State's
oppressive ways.

I also find little reason to dismiss the need to
offer armed resistance, when the state first
proscribes a political party, declaring their
ideology as criminal disallows them from
working to mobilize people and propagate
their politics and instead deploys a huge
force to militarily suppress them. Also going
by the fact that in 1971 three divisions of the
army with 45,000 soldiers were deployed
against them under what was called
"Operation Steeplechase", when they posed
no threat to the state, only shows that any
movement for emancipation of Indian people
from oppression and exploitation will be met
by coercive power of the State. In this sense
if Maoists had not honed their fighting skill
they would have been liquidated long before
and few would have noticed, let alone
mourned, their demise. I wonder if it is
properly acknowledged that it is the
presence of Maoists which provides
reformers and many a dissident with
leverage to pitch their demand for
change/modification in government policies.

Having said this, however, I am not
convinced that military action must be the
only way to advance the cause of social
transformation in every other part of India.
Apart from the fact that militarily, they are
weak; their numbers at 10,000 PLGA and
50,000 people's militia exhibits modest
capability. This also means that they have to
be mindful of their politics. It is not guns
which fight but people who wield guns which
fight. India is a vast country and diverse in
multiple ways, including socio-economic
development. The conditions which prevail
in large parts of India, such as the 34
districts where Maoists are relatively strong,
do not match conditions in some other more
populous parts. These differences have to
be taken into account.

When Marx said, revolution "peaceful if
possible, armed if necessary" even he must
not have realized that perhaps it is not either
or scenario but a combination of the two
might be needed, as the initial success
reached by Maoists in Nepal exhibit. So
what takes precedence and when, what will
the equation be between peaceful and
armed are determined by circumstances.
Responsibility even then does not rest with
Maoists alone, it rests primarily with the
State, which after proscribing them has been
hunting, arresting or annihilating them.

But in order to take a leap from the forest
strongholds to the plains outside military
victories will be inadequate because the
question will be to sustain this politically.
Methods which work in one area need not
apply, let alone, work in them. Thus I remain
confused, if not unconvinced, over the path
chosen by them. I also believe that as they
draw closer to other realities which prevail
elsewhere in India their practice will be
different and influence their theory too.
Except that it is premature to argue either
way when they themselves admit that they
have a long way to go. They were insightful
about the cul de sac reached by other left
movements, which have been reduced,
more or less, to working within the system,
unable to offer an alternative vision and
make much advance. Their assessment of
their own movement is that although they
are weak they are perceived by people as
the one movement holding out hope. Since
this is linked to their brand of politics and
because they believe theirs is a long-term
perspective, they believe that their success
or failure will be determined in the future, not
here and now.

So it was abundantly clear that Maoists will
not resile from their goal of social
transformation in which they have invested
for over half a century. Before anyone
begins to preach that Maoists ought to work
to transform the state and society
peacefully, advocates of this proposition
must explain whether the Indian political
elite will permit Maoists to work openly even
when they are perceived as threatening the
status-quo? Also that advocacy of peaceful
way is not a ruse to decimate them as it
happened in AP 2004--05? The fact that they
have not only survived but consolidated and
expanded against the most onerous
conditions, and their rhetoric matches their
practice, it sets them apart from most left
formations in India. For this reason, more
than any other left formation, they are
placed under microscope. Just as success
begets admirer, partial-success begets
critics. It is true that today's critics can
become tomorrow's admirers.

Nevertheless, to reach there they will have
to work out how they will negotiate their way
out of the diversity and plurality of India.
Battles may be won militarily but
revolutionary wars finally are won on the
political front. Without democracy it cannot
be done in 21st century India. Democracy is
not a tactical question, even when one
critiques formal democracy as being
unacceptable, real democracy is and must
be the central concern of all revolutions. But
what will be the nature of this "new"
democracy remains to be seen because,
real challenge lies ahead for the Maoists.
The RPCs are embryonic forms of a system,
in which people directly participate in making
of their own lives. This is a step forward. But
DK has certain specificities of having been
left out of State's reckoning for centuries.
Whereas elsewhere they will have to keep in
mind that more than a hundred years of
struggle has won Indian working class, rural
as well as urban, a variety of freedoms.
Much of these freedoms have been
legislated, exist on paper, or/and are today
under attack. Yet, if Maoists have to win
over the working people in areas where they
have no or little presence at present, they
will have to take this into account. So how
will they go about doing it? How does one
attract or win over a middle class, which is
used to public dissent and debate and has
an opinion on and about everything? When
the GS spoke of the need for the party to
work with lakhs and crores of people, was
he hinting towards this reality?

Be that as it may. Political plurality has
become as much, if not more, a hallmark of
India as cultural diversity. Thus will they be
able to accept and respect the fact that they
may become a leading force but not
necessarily the only force? But more than
ever before people want more than rhetoric
to believe that not only is change possible
but that it will result in real democracy. They
want an alternative democratic model, which
only Maoists are today in a position to
demonstrate because they alone hold base
areas i.e. something distinct and outside the
pale of the system. Nevertheless, while
projecting their own system as superior or
better they can not afford reckless killings, of
the Jamui kind, followed by apology, which
are unconvincing. Beheading, for example,
trade union leader Thomas Munda of Kulta
Iron Works in Koraput district, affiliated to
CITU for defying a _bandh_ call by Maoists,
can hardly endear them to those people who
are not with them, yet who need to be won
over. I know being a mass movement
mistakes will occur and crimes will get
committed. However, the decisive fact, for
me, is whether they are willing to learn and
how fast they are at learning from their
mistakes. Not because violence makes me
squeamish. But, heinous crimes committed
by revolutionaries besmirches entire
resistance, belittles the self-less labour of
thousands of ordinary Maoist cadres, and
silences those who look to Maoists to set
higher ethical standards, because revolution
is a struggle to create a superior democratic
state and society.

Revolution may not be "an express train
pulling into a station" sedately, as Lenin
once wrote. But nor can it mean regression.
The GS told us in the interview that "in
general people and Maoist revolutionaries
do not want violence or armed confrontation
with anybody. In unavoidable condition only
they take-up arms and resist their enemies,
and they are waging liberation war by
learning from the history. So, we see this as
a war of self-defense." Yes, I heartily concur
with him. Far too much is at stake. It is
axiomatic for all guerilla and anti-guerilla
wars that tactical error/s can cause strategic
defeat. For this reason, one cannot accept
reckless violence which targets civilians or
non-combatants when we know that, despite
the opposition of large number of Indians,
the war imposed by the Indian state against
the Maoists will not cease any time soon.
But precisely because revolutionaries fight
for life, therefore, they must harness
violence and use it with discipline. Indeed it
is unfortunate that the appeal issued by ten
non-funded civil liberties groups has
remained unheeded.[^/10] Having aroused
so much hope and shown through their
courage and selflessness, the way forward,
they cannot afford to drown it at the altar of
indiscipline or shortcut. Thus, unless the
party practices democracy, addresses
uneven political development, and bridges
difference between their practice and
precept as well as conduct in DK and other
areas, the remarkable transformation they
have brought about through their blood and
sweat, which raises much hopes of people,
can get dashed. This would be immensely
tragic for them and for the people of India.
