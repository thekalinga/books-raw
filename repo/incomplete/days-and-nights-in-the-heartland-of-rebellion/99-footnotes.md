machine guns, rocket launchers, INSAS
rifles, FN 35 and Glock pistols, Hecker and

Reconaissance Recoilless rifles. Besides,
they have air force providing helicopters for
ferrying troops in and out of the combat

possess INSAS rifles, AK 47s, self-loading
rifles and cache of explosives. \[The

[^/2]: The war against _Naxals_ and Maoists has
a long history of bloodletting. For instance
police sources themselves admit that
between March 1970 and August 1971 in
Kolkata and its suburbs 1,783 CPI(ML)
supporters were killed. On August 21, 1971,
in Baranagar near Kolkata, 1,000 young
people may have been slaughtered in a
single locality. Escape routes were blocked
and police guarded every lane. By 1973,
more than 32,000 CPI (ML) leaders, activists
and supporters were jailed. In West Bengal
alone there were 17,787 prisoners of which
12,016 were young and 1,399 below 18
years. Such was the phobia that 20
incidents of firing on unarmed _Naxalites_
inside jails took place between 1970--72. The
killing of eight prisoners and injuries to 60 of
them in Midnapore Central jail on 17
December 1970 and the 21 February, 1971
violence in Berhampore jail where 10
inmates died and 62 were injured, were
some of the worst instances. \[source: _Low

[^/3]: "It is very clear that the anti-_Naxal_
operations are being carried out in those
districts (East Singhbhum, West Singbhum,
Khunti, Gumla, Bokaro, Giridih, Chatra,
Latehar, Ramgarh and Hazaribagh) where
the villagers are opposing the proposed
projects for steel plants, mining industries,
power projects, dams and sponge iron
factories. ... Therefore, we have every
reason to believe that the so-called
operation green hunt or anti-_Naxal_ operation
is to get the _Adivasis_ and other local settlers
lands clear for the corporate houses rather
than cleansing the Maoists from the areas. It
seems that the state is essentially batting for
the corporate houses in the name of the
Maoists and instead of creating peace the
government is creating insecurity in the
state." \[From open letter sent by Jharkhand

[^/4]: To be referred to in a chargesheet against
Kobad Gandhy, filed by Special Cell of Delhi
Police (in FIR No 58/09, dated 20.09.2009)
on 18.02.2010 in the court of Ms Kaveri
Baweja, Tis Hazari, Delhi is not the nicest
experience of life. Yet, the reference is
neither unflattering nor inaccurate. It is the
intent they attach to it, or rather what the
officials perceive to be wrong, unlawful. ...
that's the issue. It is not my intent, it is the
intent officials attribute which makes evident
the obnoxious nature of UAPA. The chargesheet says "Mr Gautam Naulakha (can't the
MHA ensure that people's names are not
mis-spelt given the many years of
surveillance) of PUDR is quite supportive to
their outfit CPI (Maoist) and he (Kobad
Gandhy) met him many times in Delhi and
Mumbai prior to his arrest in the present
case. He also met him in Tihar Jail, Delhi".
(pp. 15) \[Emphasis added\]. The exact
implication of "quiet supportive" and "met
him many times" arises only because it is
considered 'unlawful'. In other words once
you proscribe a political party, and prevent
its ideology from being propagated or
promoted, as well as declare as unlawful
and terrorist the organization and its
members, then you criminalize what is
normal and legitimate. If the law says that
meeting, holding a meeting even between
three persons belonging to a proscribed
organization is 'unlawful', then they are
justified in taking away a person's freedom.
Membership of a proscribed organization is
a crime (UAPA Thus hobnobbing with
members of proscribed organization is
unlawful too. These provisions are
accompanied by procedures and rules which
enhance the power of the police and
prosecutor at the expense of the accused.
And simultaneously relaxes the exacting
standards for collecting, collating and use of
evidence.

[^/5]: Let me cite two instances: On February 8,
2010 the Supreme Court ordered vis-a-vis
Writ Petition (Criminal) No 103 of 2009 that
12 disappeared _adivasis_ including Sodi
Sambho be produced before it on February
15th, 2010. The case related to victims and
witnesses to a massacre at Gompad village
on October 1, 2009. Since January 2010
Sodi Sambho had gone missing. When on
order of the apex court she was brought to
Delhi by the Chattisgarh police for treatment
no one was allowed to meet her not even
her lawyer. By the time the court ordered
that her lawyer be allowed to meet her
without the police being present she had
once again gone missing. In response to this
on 29th January, 2010 the court ordered that
she, along with other 11 _adivasis_, be
brought back to Delhi by 15th February, 2010.
However, on February 9th the apex
court was informed that in pursuance of its
order on the evening of February 8th a team
of 300 police guided by Hari Ram a SPO left
on foot for Gachchanpalli to fetch seven of
the twelve _adivasis_.. The police team
reached at 5am. of 9th February the village
of Gurkha, on way to Gachchanpalli, where
they first met with a landmine explosion in
which SPO Hari Ram lost both his legs and
another police personnel got injured.
Thereupon the police team came under
firing of the Maoists. The fax produced
before the apex court also said that
Gachhanpalli was a _Naxal_ hotbed. Since
neither media nor social activists are being
permitted to enter the 'war zone' there was
no independent confirmation of the story.
However, a fact finding team by
Coordination of Democratic Rights
Organisation (which among others
comprised APCLC, HRF, PDF, PUDR,
CPCL, NPMHR etc) found that DGP of
Chattisgarh who claimed that two SPOs
were killed on 9th of February was being
less than truthful. The team visited Gompad
village on 13th February, 2010 and villagers
stated that no such incident had taken place.
Instead on 10th February SPOs and a police
party attacked the village of Ganchampalli,
near Gompad, and picked up 10 of the
villagers and took them to the Dornapal
Base Camp. Village head Pudiam
Lakshmaiah told the team that Kadithi
Muthaiah (35), Kadithi Venkaiah (25),
Kunjam Veeraiah (35), Kunjam Chilakaiah
(32), Parisi Venkaiah (25), Parisi Veeraiah
(20), Vanjam Dharma (34), Madivi Edima
(32), Povasi Edima (30) and Sodi Podiya
(45) were forcibly taken by the SPO and
police and they had not heard anything
since then. Thus it is evident that
Chattisgarh authorities in connivance with
Union Home Ministry and its various
agencies will go to any length to thwart
efforts to bring out the truth.

    This is not all. On 6th January, 2010 a team
    of social activists were accosted by
    members of Maa Danteshawri Swabhiman
    Manch and prevented from participating in a
    padyatra called by Himanshuji of Vanvasi
    Chetna Ashram in Dantewada. The same
    members of this organization had attacked
    VCA and also abused and hurled eggs and
    stones at social activists. All of this was
    dutifully broadcast by a malleable media as
    a manifestation of _adivasi_ anger against the
    supposed pro-Maoist proclivity of the social
    activists. The fact that 6th January attack on
    social activists was led by Soyam Mukka an
    absconder in a case of gang rape of _adivasi_
    girl in March 2008 (case No 84[^/09] of 2009 )
    by the Judicial Magistrate First Class in
    Konta and that all this took place in full view
    of Chattisgarh police, one which claimed
    that they were unable to trace any of the
    eight alleged rapists, makes the role of the
    state government, police administration and
    union home ministry suspect. What is also
    obvious that institutions of State and its
    agencies and the corporate media would
    much rather patronize alleged rapists and
    killers and looters than allow truth to become
    public.

    It is this deliberate attempt to silence all
    voices and not allow any independent views
    to filter out of the war zone and on the other
    hand patronage given to alleged rapists,
    killers and looters that makes this 'dirty war',
    nay "police action", so life threatening as far
    as constitutional democracy is concerned.

[^/7]: The Jamui massacre involved the killing,
allegedly by the CPI (Maoist), of 12 tribals
including women and children and wounding
of 50 others on 17 February in Phulwaria
and Korasi villages of Jamui district of Bihar.
The massacre is reported to be in retaliation
for the killing of eight Maoist cadres on 1
February, who were allegedly taken into
custody and then killed by the police.

[^/8]: On November 20, 2009, eight bogies of
the Tata-Bilaspur passenger train were
derailed near the Manoharpur railway station
in West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand by
the armed cadres of CPI (Maoist) in which
two persons, including a two year old, died
and 51 were injured. The derailment,
allegedly using detonators, was caused in
the course of a two day _bandh_ from
November 19--20 when, according to local
Maoist leaders, they were demanding that
one of their arrested leaders be produced in
Court. According to Samarji, secretary
Bihar-Jharkahnd-Orissa regional committee
of the CPI(Maoist), the "mistake" occurred
because of "overzealous new recruits."

firearms in South Asia, 63 million of which
are in civilian hands. India and Pakistan
account for most of the weapons (40 million
and 20 million respectively) where there is
local production as well, while civilians in
Nepal and Sri Lanka own an additional 3
million weapons. Civilians are the largest
category of gun owners in the region,
accounting for far more weapons than the
military, police and insurgents. See

[^/10]: A must read is Utsa Patnaik's discussion
piece "A Critical Look At Some Propositions
on Consumption and Poverty"; Economic
and Political Weekly, Vol 45, No. 6,
February 6, 2010. Also consider what
national vice-president of People's Union for
Civil Liberties (PUCL) Dr Binayak Sen had to
say at the sixth I G Khan Memorial Lecture
on 'Violence and Justice in Our Times' at
Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on
Saturday (13th March 2010). He said that
the action against Maoists is only
accentuating the problem of malnutrition in
tribal areas. According to him, malnutrition
should be the most pressing concern of the
government. A person with a body mass
index of less than 18.5 is malnourished.
According to National Nutrition Monitoring
Bureau, 33% of adult Indians have a
BMI of less than 18.5. If you disaggregate
this, over 50% of Scheduled Tribes
have a BMI of 18.5 or are undernourished.

    "The WHO says that any community of
    which over 40% population has a BMI
    of 18.5% is in a state of famine. By
    that standard, many communities in India
    are living in a state of famine. Orissa, whose
    40% population is undernourished,
    too, fits the bill."

    Military campaign against Maoists and
    displacement of tribals, he underlined, would
    only make things worse. "The government is
    displacing a large number of people from the
    very resource base that they are surviving
    on. Use of words like collateral damage by
    the government is dangerous as the Maoists
    don't carry a label on their head."

[^/11]: The statement reads: "Since the transfer
of power in 1947, there has not been a
single year when the Indian government has
not fought against our people, starting with
suppression of Telengana uprising (1946--51) followed by war against Jammu and
Kashmir, Naga people, against people of
Manipur, Assam, etc. Fact findings by Civil
Liberties --- Democratic Rights groups,
including PUDR, have brought out the fact
that such wars/armed conflicts are
intrinsically 'dirty war' where casualties
occur in form of encounters, custodial
killings, enforced disappearances, mortar
shelling, search and cordon operations,
arbitrary detentions, torture, and rape.

    The new war, we fear, in its scale and
    spread of the war against the
    _Naxalites_/Maoists will cover predominately
    nine states. The fact that the war zone
    covers primarily tribal areas of 'heartland'
    India, which is mineral rich and where the
    specter of land grab, displacement from
    forests, privatization of water resources and
    attack on people's sources of livelihood
    looms large, makes this war particularly
    gruesome. We are convinced that this war is
    nothing short of an attempt at weakening the
    formidable resistance offered by our people
    against Government of India's neo-liberal
    policy. The resistance comprises struggles
    not only led by Maoists/_Naxalites_ (from
    CPI(ML) New Democracy to CPI(ML)
    Liberation), other organisations like PSBJC
    of West Bengal, CMAS of Narayanpatna,
    workers' movement in Gorakhpur, dalit
    landless agricultural workers led by All India
    _Kisan_ Mazdoor Sabha in rural districts
    around Allahabad (UP), the NBA and other
    constituents of NAPM led struggles,
    Kalinganagar struggle spearheaded by CPI
    amongst several other. Contribution of this
    plurality of struggles, different in nature and
    even intent, is what has sustained the
    resistance.

    We the undersigned are convinced that
    singling out _Naxalites_/Maoists is precisely
    because they have offered the most
    stubborn resistance against neo-liberal
    policies of the Indian government, and which
    has acted as a fillip for the overall resistance
    being offered by other groups and parties.
    The collective resistance has thwarted so far
    Indian and foreign corporations from
    implementing more than hundred MOUs in
    Chattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand etc. This
    war, we believe, is precisely to enable
    corporations to enforce the secret MOUs
    which they have signed with the various
    state governments. We support all forms of
    resistance against this savage war for
    corporate development unleashed by the
    state against our own people.

    However, we urge all warring parties to
    declare their unequivocal adherence to
    Geneva Convention and other international
    laws in order to ensure that civilians/noncombatants are not harmed.

    We believe, that ethics of war, as enshrined
    in Article 3, common to the four Geneva
    Convention of 1949, enjoins on the parties,
    even to an internal conflict, to respect some
    basic principles of humanitarian behavior
    during war/armed conflict, and it is binding
    not just on governments but also on the
    insurgents/rebels/revolutionaries. Moreover,
    additional Protocol II of 1977 of Geneva
    Convention supplements Article 3 with few
    specific provisions where wars take place
    within a country.

    We wish to point out that issues of legality,
    reciprocity or applicability of the ethical
    principles underlying Geneva Conventions
    and Protocol II cannot be made an excuse
    to deny that these principles, which govern
    war/armed conflict, can be complied with
    and implemented, by all warring sides in so
    far as their own combat personnel are
    concerned."
