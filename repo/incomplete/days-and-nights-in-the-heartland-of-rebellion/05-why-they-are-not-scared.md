# Why They Are Not Scared?

I asked everyone I met if they were not
scared at the huge deployment of troops
with camps set up in such a way that the
guerilla zone was being encircled and a
virtual economic blockade (which under
international humanitarian law is considered
an act of war) had been imposed. One
answer I frequently came across was that
'we have to fight to establish people's power'
(_apni rajya satta ke liye ladna padega_)'. "But
are you not scared?" "If we get scared
'_sarkar_' will try to scare us even more".
Where from do they derive their confidence?
I asked Sukhmati a young woman soldier
when she went to survey the road flanked by
two security force camps, and who was the
last person to cross the road. Are you not
scared to undertake the riskiest part of the
task, first to reach the road and last to
leave? She smiled and said "I have seen
police since I was a child enter my village
and threaten us. I do not fear them". "But
how do you fight such a formidable force?"
"My companions told me that they do not
fear the military since they have advantage
of fighting in their own terrain. But SPOs
queer the pitch. Except that criminal
proclivities of the SPOs encourage people to
seek shelter or support with the Maoists."

When I posed this question to Sonu, in
charge of DK, he said that when _Salwa
Judum_ was launched in 2005, the same
question was repeatedly posed to them for
six months. "We were asked what we will do
now that villages are being attacked and
burnt and party members and sympathizers
are being hunted and killed. Some told us to
pull out. Many _Mukhias_, traders and
teachers began to believe that government
will win this time and began to spread this
line. Within six months tables were turned."

## "So what did happen?"

>By February 2006 the party responded.
They were able to rally the people. First they
did their utmost to rehabilitate those who got
displaced inside the forests. Mobilised them
and cautioned them that their displacement
was meant to depopulate the forestland and
hand it to mining corporations. Party
members reminded them about the
struggles led by their party against the forest
department, forest contractors, police as
well as their own chiefs. The pary also
brought up the Bhumkal uprising against
British Raj reminding them that without
putting up a fight they stood no chance to
secure the gains made by the people and
asked them to join people's militia to resist
_Salwa Judum_. It appears easy enough. But
to protect those escaping SJ hoodlums,
provide them shelter, rehabilitate them, give
them hope and courage takes a lot of doing
at a time when the party was being singled
out for annihilation and simultaneously had
to fend off a vilification campaign launched
by 'neutral' activists virtually justifying SJ by
claiming that party was itself to blame for
causing it. Yet, it would have been next to
impossible for the Maoists to counter SJ,
had there not been people's support for
them, to carry out this truly monumental
task.

This is what the GS meant when he said in
the interview that:

> ... people are inviting us. Even new,
less experienced cadres who are
meagerly armed are being asked to
visit these areas by the people. For
example, in Sonebhadra in Uttar
Pradesh, the villages invited us
themselves. Then again our plans to
expand from Rayagada to Nayagarh
in the form of Operation Ropeway
under which the Nayagarh Raid was
orchestrated enabled us to expand
into this area in as little as eight to ten
months. So, the Nayagarh raid not
only had military significance but also
political significance as there was
strategic reasons behind the raid.
Then again Operation Vikas was
undertaken to expand into the Manpur
(Chattisgarh) area in the plains. And
people are inviting us and their
confidence is on the high. If we
expand in this way, we will grow
definitely and expand the guerilla war.
If we proceed like this and
successfully stretch the war, then in
the longer run the political and
economic situations are bound to
change and under pressure the state
will crumble. Presently, the state is
willfully spending in military expenses,
but as the war stretches and expands
to newer and newer areas, the more it
will spend and in the longer run it
would lead to failure. We are waging
our war with this strategic plan.

Thus, it was not difficult for me to believe
when Sonu said that SJ period saw a huge
jump in recruitment to the militia and the
PLGA. He also pointed out that twice earlier,
in 1990--91 and 97--98, when "_jan jagran_
campaign" was launched by the local
exploiters, police and administration, the
movement grew strong. I asked if this meant
that they expect the same thing to happen
now when they were now confronted,
according to their own claim, by a force that
numbered around 2.5--3 lakhs in DK? The
analogy drawn by general secretary about
"honey beehive" was recalled. If millions rise
in revolt then even this force, few lakhs
strong is no match. But will people respond
to their call? The confidence displayed by
senior to lay party members, the matter of
fact response given by ordinary members,
gives the impression that they believe that
people will put up a fight, even when they
concede that they have suffered losses in
the form of arrests of large number of
leading cadres and killing of scores of
activists.

So what sustains them through thick and
thin, malignant propaganda, loss of
comrades? What do they do when faced
with such setbacks and losses? What gives
them confidence and courage to go on?
"Love and trust of people". this was the
common refrain. This finds a way also in the
pamphlets brought out by them from time to
time. A pamphlet brought out by
Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee for
the three day _bandh_ (January 25--27th, 2010)
contained an appeal to police and
paramilitary forces inviting them to ponder
why the government has launched
Operation Green Hunt. The pamphlet after
reminding them that they are fighting a war
in the interest of the capitalists and foreign
multinationals and that they are being asked
to "to kill and get reward, or get killed and
receive compensation" reminds them of their
class roots and to cease using their
weapons against their own class brethrens
and earn people's hatred. Another pamphlet,
as part of their recruitment drive (from 2
December 2009 to 10 February 2010) for
PLGA, carries an appeal to unemployed
boys and girls of Bastar not to join
government's armed forces. The leaflet says
that when one joins PLGA "you will not get
any salary but food, clothes, personal needs
will be fulfilled and your families would be
helped by the _Janatana Sarkar_. What you
will earn will be love and affection of the
people. Whereas those who join government
armed forces will get salary and right to loot,
kill and rape but also earn undying hatred of
the people and you will not be remembered.
Instead your death will be celebrated."
Another leaflet tells the personnel of
government armed forces that their war is
akin to the wars waged by foreign
aggressors against our people and that the
"Government does not regard you as
anything more than animals. Indeed no
better than slaves. Sometimes you are
called dogs (greyhound), sometimes snakes
(cobra) and sometimes cats (Black cats)".

This confidence and strength to carry on
against the heavy odds did not happen
overnight. It took thirty years of sacrifices, a
tough life, and selfless work by hundreds of
young men and women to move from being
a handful to becoming a mass movement.
To establish themselves in such a way that
today the second generation of the
movement in DK comprises predominately
of _Adivasis_. A senior party member told me
smilingly that the third generation is getting
ready. I could not fathom what he meant. I
asked him to explain. He said that since last
year party has started a Basic Communist
Training School where we take 25--30 kids in
age group of 12--15 and for six months they
go through intensive training. They are
introduced to basic concepts of MLM
(Marxism Leninism and Maoism), taught
languages (Hindi and English), maths, social
science, computer, use of different types of
weapons, and also get to do practical work
by joining a work team of the Revolutionary
People's Committees (RPC) and put in
couple of weeks of work before graduating.
This year they plan to introduce this in other
divisions too. Even otherwise Maoists are
predominately _adivasis_ indistinguishable in
nativity, language, lifestyle from their ethnic
brethren. Of course, there were party
members from AP and I met them too. It is
said that one acquires much of the body
language and speech modulation of a
dominant group over a period. This was so
true. It was difficult for me to know who is
who, from outside and who indigenous, as
every one looked more or less the same and
indeed spoke and wrote Gondi. Of course, I
do not know Gondi or any other Indian
language other than Hindi and can follow
with some labour Bengali and Punjabi. But
what was apparent is that the language
being spoken mostly, and understood by
everyone around was Gondi. There were
few occasions when I heard people
conversing in Telugu, although neither
Telugu nor Hindi is an alien language in DK
for a number of reasons.

The confidence, therefore, also stems from
the fact that most of the cadres here are
indigenous. GS told us that it is not easy to
survive the tough life that is demanded of
party members in DK. I recalled what Murali
told me that out of the two squads which
entered DK in 1980 only two members, he
and Kosa Usendi remain, rest have either
been killed, gave up or just could not cope
with life inside the forest. GS said that many
a comrade who came from outside after few
months wanted to give up full time party
work and quit the forest. This also meant
that cadres from outside are not the main
bulwark for the party; it has its roots among
the local people.

With such widespread appeal does the party
not want to function openly? Murali told me
that mass organizations of the party may not
be registered but they are there alright and
function to the extent that these unregistered
organizations spearhead struggles and enter
into negotiations when the situation
warrants. GS told us that it is important to
guard against getting bogged down in
legalism and economism and remember that
masses have to be prepared for seizure of
power. In the interview, he delved on the
various trends within the _Naxalbari_
movement and how one after another
various sections began to move away from
the path of "area wise seizure of power" and
began speaking about preparing the masses
for armed insurrection and/or exposing the
parliament from within, but without having
either an underground structure or armed
squads and without doing much of exposing.
Later when I was talking to a senior member
he quoted something to the effect that open
work is important but not "to function legally
until it's too late to function at all".

During discussions, our conversation veered
toward what has been happening across the
world in terms of ideological debate between
those who advocate working for seizure of
state power and others who instead work for
inclusionary politics by remaining a social
movement retaining the open fluid form.
Somehow party and union are seen as
closed and undemocratic to begin with. It
was not denied that there are problems. GS
spoke about how partial results or reforms
were ignored earlier and all emphasis was
placed on ultimate seizure of power and
therefore, stressed on the need to combine
immediate with the ultimate that had earlier
been overlooked. That is why so much of
the time is devoted to strengthen what they
describe as "peoples economy".

I asked them whether they allow
development activities by the State. If so, do
they allow it in guerilla zones? Does it not
undercut their effort to establish their own
rule? The answer was that where they are
unable to provide help to the people
themselves, they are not opposed to any
activity which benefits the people, be it
health, education, employment guarantee,
etc. However, where they are in control they
undertake reforms that benefit people.
Indeed, they also said that they do not
interfere with routine patrols by police and
paramilitary forces for instance. This will
happen they say. But they do not want to
engage them in combat unless they are
prepared. Will there not be a difference
between the response towards reforms in
areas where JS runs and areas where it
does not? Well, according to the GS "\[I\]n
areas where the enemy \[security force\]
camps are located, even in those villages,
we have Revolutionary People's Committees
where work is still going on. Hundreds of
people built up ponds in complete
knowledge of the security forces in the
camps".

But time and again we were told that
Maoists are not against any pro-people
reforms such as those being introduced in
areas where their own movement is not
strong or in control, and therefore, where
they were unable to provide succor to the
people. In such cases, they fight for
implementation of these reforms. I recall
reading about the invitation extended by the
party in Jharkhand to the Planning
Commission team to meet their state
leaders to discuss rural poverty. However,
where they run parallel administration and
are strong they undertake their own reforms
by "strengthening people's economy by
encouraging cooperative movement". That is
to undertake reforms in such a way as to
harness the collective energy of the people
in improving their material conditions, rather
than waiting for someone to come and bail
them out. I was reminded of the what the
report by the Expert Group constituted by
the Planning Commission to look into
"Development Challenges in Extremist
Affected Area" had to say: "the purpose of
the report (is) to see how the government
may eliminate the causes of unrest by
constitutional and legal means and restore
faith of the affected population in the system
of governance, established by the
constitution and law". (3.1.3) In contrast to
the paternalism or benevolence of the state
expressed by the Planning Commission, as
though some favour was being bestowed on
people in return for them not to take to
armed resistance, the Party pursued a line
to enable people, with the most oppressed
taking the lead, to struggle and realise their
aspirations by participating in the making of
their own destiny. Between the two lies a
seminal difference.

I was told that while they welcome reforms
they are aware that this forms part of
counter-insurgency operations as well, part
of "repression and reforms" --- first, terrorise
people so that they begin to see reforms as
relief and begin to believe that something is
being done. This also goes by the name of
"winning hearts and mind" or WHAM under
which various programmes are being
launched. Thus in Bijapur, Dantewada,
Malkangiri, Rayagada, Chatra, Palamu,
Hazaribagh and Gaya districts as part of
pilot programs various program are being
promoted and these go by the name of
Janmabhoomi, Vana Sanrakshan Samiti,
Astha Shibir, Yuva Shakti, Gaonbandi,
Three Tent Programmes etc. Also it is being
propagated that socialism and communism
are outdated, defeated ideologies and that
revolution cannot succeed. A senior party
member said that it is significant that the
Indian government is propagating that it is
necessary to use violence to save the
people from perils of communism and
eradicate Maoist menace. "This is a way",
he said, "to prepare the Indian people to get
used to violence and to accept it as
something necessary. This is also meant to
send a message across that the Indian State
is very strong and it's a matter of time only
for them to rid the country of this 'menace'."
But he said that they are prepared. "The
party", he said, "read the _Salwa Judum_ for
what it was, namely, as the first phase of an
all out offensive."

Sonu pointed out that the objective behind
the SJ was 'to drain the water to catch the
fish' and to create 'strategic hamlets'. "The
government thought we would get finished."
He said that earlier when party used the
term 'fascist' people could not understand
what was meant by it. But with SJ this
became possible. Thus SJ became a good
teacher, negative no doubt. It helped clear
confusion. Many opponents of the party
changed their views when they saw
large-scale displacement accompanied by
burning, looting and raping. Others realized
that SJ was meant to get rid of the
movement so that something that had
served them well, JS, was destroyed, their
organized strength whittled down, and/or
their forest land could then be handed over
to corporations. He was not exaggerating.
Consider what an official draft version of the
report had to say on this matter. Authors of
Ministry of Rural Development's "Committee
on Agrarian Relations and Unfinished Tasks
of Land Reforms" (2009), which has now
been censored by the government editors,
explain the causes behind _Salwa Judum_,
which has a direct bearing on mining
concessions:

>There was initial resistance (in 2000)
>to land acquisition and displacement
>from the tribals. The state withdrew its
>plans under fierce resistance. An
>argument put forward was 'you don't
>play foul with the _Murias_', it's a matter
