# Issue of Land

Land was the most serious issue. Not only
did the _adivasi_ peasantry face the illegal and
extra-legal exactions of the forest
department which affected all _adivasis_, they
also faced domination of their chiefs which
meant that they had to labour on land of
their chiefs and only on completion of this
task could they tend to their own field. Not
only did the _Majhis_, _Patels_, _sarpanch_ etc
own more land, but failure to obey them
resulted in fines in the form of alcohol, goats
or in some cases ostracization. This was as
true of the area which had taken to settled
cultivation as those where _penda_ (shifting
cultivation) was practiced. Basically it meant
that _adivasis_ depended on a single crop, but
could tend to their farms only after tending to
the fields of their chiefs. Thus, by the time
they came to tend theirs, monsoon would be
receding making their already precarious
conditions even more uncertain. This further
created relationships of bondage with their
chiefs. In addition, landless or marginal
_adivasi_ peasants were numerous and
paucity of land together with low yields
forced many to work as agricultural labour.
They worked either as '_naukar_' (i.e., free
labour) receiving seasonal wages or as
'_kabadi_' or attached labour with a large
landowner getting food in lieu of wages.
\[See in particular the "Background" chapter
in the report _When the State Makes War On
Its Own People; Violation of People's Rights
During the Salwa Judum_, April 2006,
brought out by APDR, IAPL, PUCL and
PUDR\]. Furthermore, '_penda_' or shifting
cultivation had been banned (except in
Abujmaad) by the Forest Department,
without commensurate improvement in
settled cultivation, which also contributed to
low yields, as many a cadre pointed out to
me, pushing them into servitude.

Sonu proudly said that "there is almost no
land less peasantry here today, however,
initially there were in considerable number.
Three lakh (300,000) acres of forest land
was won over. So, the first struggle within
the village was launched around the land
movement. The tribal chiefs had a lot of land
under their power. But once that was
acquired along with the forest land, the
standard of living in this area took an
upward turn. In the initial years, there was
food scarcity as well. Now people get food
twice a day and they also possess land. The
struggle against the forest department was
thus combined with the struggle against the
tribal chiefs."

It is one thing to distribute land and quite
another to ensure that agriculture prospers.
In the entire Bastar and Gadchiroli region,
only 2% of the land was irrigated. The
movement took it upon itself to start building
irrigation tanks at the village level.
Cooperative farming was also introduced,
wherein three to four families worked
together to plough the land. Even while
building houses or doing other work,
cooperative teams of 11 members were
constituted. It is noteworthy that the
constitution of JS mentions the following:

>(t)hough there is private ownership over
land, it (JS) will encourage collective work
through mutual labor cooperation of the
peasants in leveling the land, tilling,
transplantations, weed removing,
harvesting, growing vegetables, raising
fruits, fish, cattle raising and other such
agricultural and agriculture related works. It
will thus develop the cooperative movement.
It will strive to increase productivity and
production so as to fulfill the necessities of
food grains to the people and give
importance to the development of
agriculture. The collective lands, collective
plantations, collective ponds, fish raising and
other such things shall be in the control of
this (agriculture) department.

These mutual labour cooperatives or work
teams were built from a class perspective.
"Putting the poorer peasant families along
with the rich peasantry would have meant by
the time they ploughed their own land, the
monsoon would be passed". The
cooperative system, as it emerged, led to
the development of a feeling of collectivity
and unity. The availability of land together
with irrigation facilities led to marked
improvement in the standard of living.
Increasing agricultural production is of great
importance, especially to overcome uneven
development. Some areas were relatively
more developed than others, and in some
areas the party had been working for longer
than in other parts. Besides, in some parts
'_penda_' (shifting cultivation) is still practiced
whereas there are parts where tractor is
employed for ploughing. In between, there is
settled cultivation that uses shovels for
ploughing, which obviously does not turn the
soil deep enough and elsewhere cattle are
used for ploughing. (The platoon which
accompanied me to Maad had two members
who had never drunk fresh milk or tasted
yoghurt because there were no cattle where
they came from). As part of the policy to
improve agriculture, JS had bought 106
pairs of buffalos for use in Maad. Fourteen
died leaving them ninety two. Now villagers
who had switched to settled cultivation were
being taught how to plough and train the
animal to be harnessed for ploughing. But
local RPC members Narsingh and Kumma,
who showed me several collective farms told
me that they found _penda_ cultivation to be
superior to more elementary forms of settled
cultivation. One advantage with _penda_ is
that not only are yields higher but along with
Kohla or Kosra grain a number of other
crops can also be grown simultaneously.
