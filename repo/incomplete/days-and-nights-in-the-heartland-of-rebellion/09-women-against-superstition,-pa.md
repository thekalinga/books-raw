# Women: Against Superstition, Patriarchy and the State

Together with land was tied the issue of
women's emancipation. Women did not
inherit landed property and after marriage
could not freely participate in ceremonies
and rituals or move from one village to
another. During menstruation, they were
forced to remain outside the village and their
attendance in meetings was discouraged.
With the emergence of Krantikari _Adivasi_
Mahila Sanghatan (KAMS), these demands
began to be raised. It was KAMS that raised
the issue of Ghotul and began a debate to
end what had become a system where
women serviced men. It took six years of
relentless propaganda to end the license
young adult males had to consort with
women of their choice and where tribal
chiefs or rich peasants (_dhani kisan_) among
tribals as well as later forest department and
police personnel exploited young tribal
women. The point was that party did not go
and decree anything. What they did was to
facilitate debate and propagate their views
and over a period of time brought about
acceptance of reform. So it is not as though
'Ghotul' has disappeared, but it has been
transformed.

As a digression, when we were in Maad one
of the soldiers asked me, "do you see that
field in front, dada?" "Yes", I said, "what
about it?" "This land was cleared by us and
we built the boundary wall and then asked
villagers to cultivate it as a collective farm. It
is good for _dhaan_ (paddy). But villagers
were scared and they said that the land
belonged to 'Deva' and that if they cultivate
it they could fall ill." "So who cultivated it
then?" "We did", he said. "Our platoon did.
And now we hope that villagers will see that
nothing bad has happened to us and sow
paddy next time." Similarly, Niti, party
representative in an area RPC said. "very
often when people fall ill they say they will
go to 'ojha' for curing themselves. We do not
stop them but request them to also take their
medicine. They do, and if they then believe
they have been cured by the 'ojha' that's fine
with us so long as we can help them with
medicine, because we know it is that which
will cure them."

If women comprise by far the most articulate
members of the movement and their number
has grown, it is less than fifty % that
the party itself mandates and varies
between 40--45%. But it is remarkable
that one sees young women as
commanders and leading cadres of JS.
However, not all the problems encountered
by women have been addressed, and not all
demands raised by them met. As women
cadres themselves say the difference is that
they are encouraged to raise issues and
take on responsibilities. The JS constitution
mandates the agriculture department under
its Article 3(c) to "release joint _patta_ in the
name of families and in the name of wife
and husband." This met with opposition but
they are pushing through. In any case
anyone who travels inside JS areas cannot
fail to observe the prominent role of women
in the movement. All my conversations were
not with the men but included women. In
many ways enlightened cosmopolitanism is
what one encountered in the JS area where
issues of gender discrimination and
patriarchy were openly discussed and
challenged.

There were many issues that I wanted to
probe such as the question of love marriage
within the same endogamous group since I
had been told that party backed such
couples, which went against tribal customs. I
wanted to know also whether household
chores were being shared between men and
women. I also needed to know whether if
both wife and husband were party members
the husband helped with household chores if
wife had to attend meetings or attend to
party work. Unfortunately, I had to choose
between this and travel to Abujmaad and
see developments being carried out there. I
chose the latter.
