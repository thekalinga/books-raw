# I Needed Some Answers

Talking about displacement and land grab
and party's role against this inevitably led
me to pose a question, surely minerals need
to be exploited and mineral based industries
needed for progress, so in opposing
corporate land grab are they not opposing
industrialization _per se_?

Precisely because of this, said Raju, we will
soon be coming out with our own mining
policy.

## What will be its salient points?

Wait till it is released but one thing is for
certain the low royalty of approximately ₹1050,
per metric ton, depending on the
quality of iron ore, is too low when the
international iron ore price per m.t. had gone
as high as ₹10,000 plus. He referred to a
booklet brought out in Chattisgarh which
highlighted some of the anomalies of
government's lopsided policy which benefits
foreign and big corporations. Referring to
that he said that NMDC supplies iron ore to
Japan from its Bailadilla mines at ₹400 per
m.t. Whereas local manufacturers have to
buy iron ore at one time for ₹5800 p m.t.
which was been brought down when the
union Chattisgarh Mukti Morcha linked
Engineering Workers Union impressed on
the owners that instead of squeezing money
from workers by lowering wages they should
be lobbying with the government against
discriminatory policy followed to charge
them exorbitant prices for iron ore, whereas
allowing captive mines at throwaway prices
for multinational corporations.

According to Raju, the party was firmly
against handing over mining leases to
MNCs, that too for export of minerals rather
than for use of domestic industries. They
also believe, he said, that mining should be
strictly regulated and restricted.

What about advantages of scales of
production, energy saving, restoration of
land after excavation. ...

He said that all these issues will be
addressed and that out party is not against
local industries.

When I asked him does it mean that mines
will be leased out to private parties, if so
what would be the criterion and what
guarantee will they have to ensure against
exploitation.

For answers, Raju smilingly insisted, I must
have patience and wait.

While I will wait, what was, nevertheless,
significant was the need felt by the Party to
think in terms of going public with their own
version of mining policy. Moreover, they
seem to have deliberated on the matter.
Because Raju said that while party is not
opposed to industrialization they are firmly
opposed to big industries. Also they believe
that forest based product manufacturing
such as _amla_, bamboo or wood etc should
be given preference.

Another question which troubled me was
how does the party meet all its
requirements?

A document "Our Financial Policy" given to
me to read had this to say:

>There are three resources in the main for
>fulfilling our economic needs. One is the
>party membership fee, levy and the
>contributions of the people and the second
>one is by confiscating the wealth and the
>income sources of the enemy and the third
>is the taxes we collect in the guerilla zones
>and base areas by following progressive tax
>system. At present income through
>independent production is not an important
>source of income for us (emphasis added).
>This is possible only after the establishment

>Our sources of income are limited but our

>is not increasing par with the growing

>So, to achieve the above said balance, to

This was party's policy, I wanted to know
what is their revenue income? Is it ₹1400
cr or more as the government claims? Raju
laughed to say that if they had so much they
would be able to to do so much more. Infact
if there was social peace and they were able
to carry out their various programs they may
be able to reach that revenue figure. Most of
the money is collected in form of 'royalty' on
_tendu patta_, bamboo, tamarind, other forest
produce. Revenue accruing from looting of
bank or confiscation of wealth are far less.
Yes they do tax some of the companies or
contractors which operate in what they
describe as 'guerilla zone'. Officials call this
extortion they call it tax. It really is of no
consequence, except that their sources are
indigenous and not external, which even
government is forced to concede. In this
sense it is in the time honoured tradition of
patriotic revolutionaries.

It is also worth recalling that thirty years of
party's intervention has brought about a see
change in wage rates as evident from
significant hike in price of picking/cutting
_tendu_ leaf, bamboo, tamarind etc. Thus the
levy charged by the party from _adivasis_ is
not exhorbitant or a burden. There is some
anecdotal reference made also to how
much revenue was generated from fish
cultivation. In south Dantewada it was said
that a RPC earned ₹5 lakh in income from
fish cultivation! This could mean that other
RPCs too must be earning income, less or
more? In the ARPC I was in their fish
income was less than ₹1 lakh. It would
appear, however, that independent
generation of income was unevenly
distributed across DK but there was certainly
some generation. It could also depend on
access to market. Because of war situation
and restriction on entry and exit it is likely
that many of the goods which otherwise
could have been sold in _Haats_ and
generated income were being consumed
inside. This must impact RPC and ARPC
income.

Significantly, I was told that JS is
contemplating setting up a paper plant to
meet its need since purchasing and
transporting paper has become a problem.
Bamboo is in abundance in the area and so
is water. They can do without bleach or at
least keep its use to bare minimum and only
hurdle is power generation. If they are able
to ensure generation of power or generate
power through micro hydel project, which
are not too difficult to install and technology
or rather technical expertise readily available
inside they might be able to overcome even
this problem. The ingenuity, enterprise and
ambition of the JS is quite remarkable.
