# Old faces, new hopes

_The short long spell at Indian Social Institute, Bangalore_

\ 

June 1975, '_National Emergency_' was declared. Thousands of political
leaders, intellectuals, activists were either thrown behind bars or held
under house-arrest. The media was brought to its knees. Only a couple
of newspapers had the courage to leave their editorial column blank
as a sign of protest. Critical-minded intellectuals, writers, authors
were anxiously awaiting the midnight-knock at their door. Since
dissent to Emergency could not be expressed openly, confidential
communications about what was happening in different parts of
the country were passed from hand to hand in cyclostyled sheets.
An atmosphere of fear pervaded the whole society. People talked in
whispers. The only 'positive outcomes' were that workers and officials
in government departments started to report for duty punctually and
trains started to run on time!

Justification for the declaration of the Emergency was announced
through, what was called '_Twenty Points Programme_'. The very first point
was '_Land to the tiller_'. I, Stan Swamy, had just taken charge of Indian
Social Institute Training Centre (ISI-TC), Bangalore. It was the training
organ of the Indian Social Institute, New Delhi. My colleagues, apart
from their academic qualifications, were persons who had emerged
from Trade and Labour Union backgrounds. We realized that times
had changed. Militant youth were walking out of universities calling
the university-education irrelevant and searching for meaningful
alternatives. The very respectable and charismatic leader Jay Prakash
Narayan of Bihar gave a call for civil disobedience. College students
in their thousands came out on the streets looking for a leader who
would lead and guide them in their search for new meanings.

The ISI-TC, started in the 1950s, had been conducting training
sessions of various durations to women and men involved in
socio-economic development works. The thrust was to 'equip them
with skills' in agriculture, animal husbandry, cooperatives, community
development and so on. But already by the 1970s, the unavoidable
realization began to dawn, that so-called 'development' was eluding
those who most needed it. This was so because it was all "top-down".
The justification was that 'development' would "trickle-down". The
idea was to encourage wealth creation on top, as in an overhead water
tank, so that it would flow down naturally. Sadly, the poor are looking
up all the time but hardly anything has trickled down to them.

## The Pedagogy of the Oppressed

As this "trickle-down" ideology engulfed the countries of the Global
South (Central and Latin America, Africa and Asia), the philosophy
enunciated by Paulo Freire in his small booklet _The Pedagogy of the
Oppressed_ began to ring a bell to the oppressed. _The Pedagogy of the
Oppressed_ advocated, that if the oppressed would be _conscientised_
(awakened) about their situation, the contradictions prevalent
in their society and the mechanisms of exploitation and
oppression, they would rise up and devise ways of freeing themselves
from oppression. As there was no Indian edition of the book, we
summarized the book into a few pages, photocopied it and shared it
among all the activists who were in touch with ISI, Bangalore. Our
friends in the field translated it in their local vernaculars, and through
informal education, we began delivering the message to the deprived
people in our areas of involvement. A new enthusiasm on the part of
people became visible.

## 'Socio-political Analysis'... ripple becomes wave ...

Within this scenario, on one fine morning in the early 1970s, a group
of students who had left their professional colleges walked into
ISI-TC and said to the director, "Please teach us Marxism"! It came
as a wakening call to us, the teaching staff, and we asked ourselves
"How do we respond to this new demand of this new generation?"
We introduced 'socio-political analyses' as the main thrust, followed
by methods of mobilizing / organizing the exploited and oppressed
masses to claim their due rights in society. As the appeal of Social
Analysis caught on, we, the staff members were called upon, to give
shorter courses here, there and everywhere. We did not shy away from
acknowledging that the content of our social analysis was based on
the Marxian tools of analysis.

## '_Land to the tiller_' imbroglio: Well-intended policy sacrificed at the altar of class-power

As ISI-TC, together, with several other individuals, groups and
organizations joined protests and demonstrations against the
Emergency in whatever way possible, we almost accidentally came
across a situation in which the implementation of the government's
'land to the tiller' policy was called for. In a small village, at a stone's
throw from the north of Bangalore city, three landlords owned about
300 acres of land and the rest of the village, about 30 families, were
the tenants (the actual tillers) of the land. They had been the actual
cultivators of all the land for generations. If anybody had the right to
become owners, these tenant-families had that right. We did a brief
study of the situation, contacted the tenants quietly and impressed
upon them their rights. A local English daily published the findings
of our study titled '_New awakening in sleepy hamlet_'. Immediately, the
landlords breathed anger at the tenants and at ISI. However, there
was a silver lining ... the Deputy Commissioner of Bangalore district
announced that he would personally supervise the distribution of
land-titles to the tenants. He went straight to the village, ordered the
block-level officials to be present with all land-records of the village,
gathered the tenants and the landlords, and went from plot to plot
and verified the real 'cultivator' of each plot. He directed the
land-related officials to process the paperwork promptly. The tenants
and their families were jumping with joy.

## Hopes of tenants becomes a mirage ...

The three landlords, who were powerful persons with political
influence, started to pull strings at higher levels where the poor tenants
could not reach. They filed a case in Karnataka High Court accusing
the tenants of false claims. They produced papers and documents,
whereas all that the tenants could produce were the electricity bills
they had paid for pumping water to their fields. The HC in its
'wisdom' (!) gave its verdict in favour of the landlords. The landlords
went even further and pulled strings at the highest levels. The Deputy
Commissioner who had seriously taken up the implementation of
the policy --- 'land to the tiller' --- was removed from his post instantly
with the consolation prize of being made the state commissioner of
Fisheries Department. He was sent to Australia for training in fisheries
management. **A thorn removed from the flesh of the ruling class!**

In this painful scenario, a few local parish Catholic priests who were
in good relationship with the landlords accused ISI-TC, and me
in particular, of plotting to divide the local church. The Diocesan
authorities asked for my removal from Bangalore. Fortunately, the
Jesuit superiors stood in solidarity with me and ISI and declined to
oblige the demand of the local church authorities.

## Thus, ended the tragic pretence of the government to give land to the tiller

**Spontaneous screening process** ... as a result of introducing a
clearly Marxian approach to the understanding of the structures and
functioning of society, some trepidations started to be felt among
those groups and organizations which imbibed traditional reservations
about Marxism as advocating 'atheism'. Such groups, mostly religious,
gradually stopped sending participants to our training programme.
Nevertheless, other people's movements, people's organizations,
left-parties-related mass fronts started to respond to our approach in a
more positive manner. That natural screening process of participants
was indeed a welcome development.

**Reaching a broader audience through publication** ... more and
more activists asked us to give them solid material in print form
which they could take to their colleagues in the field. So we, the
teaching staff, divided the topics among ourselves and other close
colleagues and published small booklets on the salient aspects of
Social Analysis. Our publications were well received by activists,
although some religious circles had some heart-aches about the
whole tone being "Marxian", even to the extent of questioning if ISI
was still a Jesuit institute or if it had become a Marxist centre! We
thought of a strategy to counter this. We invited some prominent
Christian theologians for a two-week reflection towards the end
of the 1970s. We discussed with them the salient features of our
societal analysis. At the end of the session, the theologians issued
a joint statement, not only endorsing our analysis, but also calling it
the need of the hour. That intervention of theologians put to rest, at
least to some extent, the hesitations and doubts about our intentions
and initiatives.

**Who and how many are still swimming?** Batch after batch of young
people, especially from deprived communities, came and participated
wholeheartedly in our training programme. They went back to their
respective communities to educate and organize themselves. In their
efforts to spread the knowledge of social analysis to their colleagues
who were not in a position to come to ISI for the three-months course,
they called on us to go to their places to give shorter sessions ranging
from 10--15 days. Responding to their call, I myself went to different
parts of the country as well as to the neighbouring countries of
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to give training sessions. Within India, the
communities which drew me to them like a magnet were the _Dalits_ in
Tamil Nadu and the _Adivasis_ of central India (present Jharkhand and
Chhattisgarh). The _Dalits_ in Tamil Nadu were becoming increasingly
aware of the prevalent economic and social oppression. They had
been drawn to the philosophy and way shown by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar
and had started to mobilize themselves forming some significant
movements. The _Adivasi_ communities in central India were still
reeling under the plunder of their natural resources and could not
strike a clear way out. In Sri Lanka, the Tamil plantation workers in
the central part of the country, who had been the victims of severe
exploitation and oppression, called on me several times. I responded
to their call by going to them every other year until the pogrom against
Tamils began in 1983.

In all truth and humility, some sobering facts must be mentioned:

(1) many of the participants of our training programme fell by the
wayside, mainly because they could not act independently from the
system (religious, and NGOs); on the contrary, they were absorbed
into these systems. However, a few of them have still played some
role, to the extent possible;
(2) many became active members in
specific people's movements/organizations taking up specific issues
of the people;
(3) a few got out of the system and joined some left
or socialist oriented parties and even braved jail sentences; (4) a few
others laid down their lives for the cause of oppressed people with
whom they had identified themselves in full measure.

**Opting for a new horizon...!** As the 1980s was drawing to a close,
I felt that 15 years (1975--1990) was a long time to have spent in an
institutional set up however vibrant and open-ended it might have
been. Besides, the _Adivasi_ societies who were my 'first love,' even
before I came to ISI, were calling me to be with them in their struggle
to claim their right to self-respect and dignity. _So, I bade farewell to 'old
face' ISI and plunged into the world of Adivasis with 'new hopes'_.
