# From the Publisher

Dear friends,

\ 

With profound gratitude to God for the gift of life to Stan, Indian
Social Institute, Bangalore (ISI-B) brings out this publication, which is
titled as, 'I am not a silent spectator'. In 2019, when Stan stayed at the
Institute, he proposed that he would be collating all his write ups and
desired that ISI-B, where he worked for 16 years and as its Director
for 11 years, publish it. I had gladly agreed. He prepared the draft
while he was in ISI Bangalore and Dr. Ambedkar Cultural Academy,
Madurai from June to December 2019. Later, Fr. P. M. Antony SJ, the
current Director of _Bagaicha_ helped Stan to edit it.

Stan has asked Prof. Nandini Sundar to pen a foreword and gave me
the final draft by July 2020. This book should have been in the public
domain by August 2020. But, by the end of July 2020, the National
Investigation Agency began its interrogation. Stan went through
15 hours of questioning. Though he desired to publish it after the
interrogation, later, in consultation with his friends, he agreed to
postpone the publication.

After the arrest on 8 October 2020, while he was in Taloja prison,
Mumbai, he reminded me a couple of times about the publication.
I suggested to him that it might be better to publish it once he was
on bail. He agreed. As the bail process was getting delayed, again he
reminded me while he was in the Holy Family Hospital, but this time
left it to me by saying, "You know the right time to publish. I know
you will publish it".

I did not know that I would be able to bring the song of the caged
bird only after his demise. On the one hand, I feel sad that I could not
fulfill his desire when he was alive. On the other hand, I feel grateful
that Stan has passed on his memories and rich experiences through
this publication. Three chapters are added subsequently --- Interrogation of Fr. Stan Swamy by the National
Investigation Agency, If and when I am arrested was
written after the interrogation and Prison diary and
poems captures the life of Stan in Taloja prison. The prison diary
is prepared mostly from his letters to Fr. David Solomon SJ, and me
and information exchanged over phone calls from the prison. This
memoir very well captures the inner moments of Stan, his struggles
and hopes and his works in various places. As a Jesuit and Human
Rights _Adivasi_ activist, he truly believed that this world can be
transformed. He taught all of us the meaning of life. I believe that
anyone who reads this memoir will be inspired to contribute their
might in accompanying the _Adivasis_, _Dalits_ and other marginalized
communities.

I thank the present and former Jesuits of _Bagaicha_, especially,
Fr. David Solomon SJ, (Solo) the former Director, Fr. Sebastian
Lakra SJ, Fr. P.M. Antony SJ, Fr. Peter Martin SJ, Fr. Stany D'Souza SJ,
Fr. Jerome Cutinha SJ, and Fr. Frazer Mascarenhas SJ who journeyed with
Stan. I am grateful to Optim designers and printers, Bangalore for
their timely support. I express my gratitude to Fr. Jerry Rosario SJ,
Fr. John Messi SJ and New Leader Publishing House for preparing
the cover page in a short duration. I would like to acknowledge
the support I received from Mr. Shujayathulla, programme staff
of ISI-B and Ms. Harshita, interning with ISI-B in bringing out this
publication.

This memoir is Stan's final gift to all of us. May he continue to live in
our hearts and may his life, mission and death inspire us!
