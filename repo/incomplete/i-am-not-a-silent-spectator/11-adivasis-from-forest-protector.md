# _Adivasis_ ... from forest-protectors to 'forest-destroyers'!

_The making and unmaking of the Forest Rights Act, 2006_

\

The way _Adivasi_ (indigenous) peoples have been treated with regard
to their traditional use of forests has been a gross injustice ever since
the colonial rulers took control over the forests. After independence,
the new Indian ruling class followed the same process, claiming
absolute authority over forests. Trees were cut indiscriminately,
timber-mafias were allowed to play havoc with the forests disregarding
the indigenous peoples and their traditional rights in the forests which
were and have been their homes.

It used to be the custom of the forest department to connive with
forest-mafias to wantonly cut trees. Periodically, some higher forest
officers would come to inspect the well-being of forests. The lower
level officials would walk into neighbouring _Adivasi_ villages, catch
hold of a few men, foist false cases of illegal tree-cutting against
them and throw them in jail. One particular case might be recalled
in Singhbhum district of erstwhile Bihar. About five thousand
_Adivasis_ were dragged to the court for years. During the 1980s, a
dedicated _Adivasi_-rights activist studied the entire case. He ploughed
through mountains of documents of the British era in archaeological
museums with regard to _Adivasis_' traditional forest-rights. He
filed a case in the Indian Supreme Court challenging the violation
of _Adivasis_' traditional rights by the forest department. The court
appointed a commission to probe into and report the matter. The
commission interviewed several of the accused, forest officials
and duly submitted its report. The report clearly brought out how
the unscrupulous forest department, in connivance with equally
unscrupulous timber-mafia, had been harassing _Adivasis_ who lived
in and around forests. The Supreme Court, in one stroke of the pen,
wrote off hundreds of false cases and freed thousands of _Adivasis_
who had been wrongly implicated. The court also warned the then
Bihar government about harassing innocent _Adivasis_ in this manner
in the future.

Nevertheless, the harassment continued in all the predominantly
_Adivasi_ states of central-eastern India and elsewhere. At long last, the
'Forest Rights Act, 2006' was passed by the UPA government which
avowedly aimed to set right the "historic injustice" done to _Adivasis_
and other traditional forest-dwelling communities with regard to their
traditional rights in forests. The Act declared that, all _Adivasi_ families
shall be entitled to two-and-a-half hectares (6.25 acres) of the forest
land where they have been living and cultivating. It also declared that
other non-_Adivasi_-forest-dwelling households, who have lived and
worked in forests for more than three generations, would be entitled
to similar ownership. Accordingly, it directed the government to
set up adequate mechanisms to carry out the provisions of the
Act. The government machinery went into action and set up the
three-tier scrutinizing bodies to verify the genuineness of claims:
1^st^ _Gram Sabha_, 2^nd^ Block-level and 3^rd^ District-level committees. The
format of the applications was also publicized.

A tremendous enthusiasm began to prevail among _Adivasi_-rights-activists
who spread the 'good news' among the people living in forests.
Thousands upon thousands of applications poured in claiming
ownership of forest-lands they had inhabited. The future looked
bright. However, the axe was soon to fall on their cherished dreams.

At the national level, 41 lakh applications were submitted over a
period of a decade. Of these 18 lakh were approved; 3 lakh held
in suspense, and 20 lakh rejected! In Jharkhand state alone, 30,000
petitions were submitted, 11,000 were granted ownership rights,
4,000 held in suspense and 15,000 rejected. In short, 50% of
all applications at the national and state levels were rejected.

The real point of concern is that most of the applications were
approved by the _Gram Sabha_ but got stuck at the Block level and
even more at the District level. The reason for this anomaly is simple:
the members of the _Gram Sabha_ know each other well, they know
who cultivates which land and for how long. So they approved most
of the applications. On the other hand, the committee-members at the
Block and District levels are mostly outsider-non-_Adivasi_-officers, most
of whom have hardly any sympathy for _Adivasis_; in fact, a greater
proportion of them would even be opposed to giving ownership
rights to forest dwellers.

## The cruellest cut of all was yet to come

Almost out of the blue, the honourable Supreme Court of India,
in early 2019, issued a unilateral order to immediately evict all
the _Adivasi_ and forest-dwelling households whose applications
for forest-land-ownership had been rejected by different states'
governments. It came as a bomb-shell to _Adivasis_ across the country.
This order of the SC was in response to a complaint petition by an
'animal-lover' accusing the Forest Department of failing in its duty
to evict those whose petitions had been rejected. Tragically, the
SC did not bother to find out if the process followed through the
three-tier-system was valid, humane and just. Nor did it take note
of the fact that if the 20 lakh families whose applications had been
rejected are thrown out of their hearths and homes; where would
they go to? Neither the central nor any of the state governments
had worked out a rehabilitation programme for those who would be
losing all that they had.

This most insensitive action of the SC evoked an overwhelming
anger on the part of _Adivasi_ societies throughout the country.
Demonstrations, public meetings and protest rallies against state
governments for not standing up to protect _Adivasi_ and other
forest-dwelling communities took place all over the country. Soon
enough, the honourable SC agreed to review the case and directed all
state governments to submit within six months a report about how
they went about implementing the Forest Rights Act. At the time of
writing, as of August 2019, not all state governments have submitted
their reports. What the SC will do next is as yet unclear.

## Animal life more precious than human life?

The Forest Department has now become energized. It wants to
guarantee that wild animals will have an assured 'corridor' in the forests
of India. Hence, it wants to make sure that no human beings will
come in the way of animals. 'Wild-life corridor', 'Elephant's corridor',
'Tigers' corridor', and perhaps other corridors, will soon stretch
across several districts of central India. The disastrous consequence
of such romantic ecological initiatives might involve the displacement
of thousands of mostly _Adivasi_-villages. As always, if hundreds of
villages would be forcibly driven out of their ages-long habitations in
the forests, where will they go? Are there any rehabilitation measures
prepared for them? There is a stunning silence on the part of the
government and the judiciary regarding these issues.

_Adivasi_ communities have, in their respective _Gram Sabhas_, resolved
that they will not move. On the contrary, they have been claiming that
they have lived all these centuries in harmony with nature and animals.
They demand that this harmonious relationship be acknowledged and
appreciated by the rest of society and that they be allowed to live in
peace in the company of animals and all other organs of Mother
Earth.
