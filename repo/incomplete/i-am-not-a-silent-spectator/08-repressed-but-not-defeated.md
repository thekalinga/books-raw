_The sad saga of 'under-trial prisoners' and unfinished efforts to reach out to them_

\

When one opens the morning newspaper or opens a TV news
channel in the _Adivasi_ states of Central-Eastern India, one finds the
media reports of one or more _Adivasi_ and _Dalit_ youth being sent
to jail on the suspicion of being _naxals_ or helpers/sympathizers of
_Naxals_. According to media reports, several hundreds of _Adivasi_ and
_Dalit_ youth are languishing in the jails of Jharkhand as _naxal_-suspects.
When the general reading/viewing public gets used to this as a matter
of daily occurrence and finds nothing amiss, it is a dangerous sign for
a healthy democracy. Sadly, most of the educated, urban, middle-class
public approves of this police action and is happy thinking that the
police are doing a 'good job' against what is called "_Naxalite_-menace".

In 2015, we at _Bagaicha_, felt that we should not rest with the media
reports but should find out the reality ourselves. First, we approached
jail-superintendents for permission to go inside the jails to interview the
UTPs but our request was flatly refused; then we sent a questionnaire
as per the _Right to Information Act_ (RTI) to all jail-superintendents of
all the 24 jails of Jharkhand. As per the Act, the respondent must
answer the request for information within 30 days of receipt of the
application. We patiently waited for two months and only 12 of the 24
jail superintendents bothered to respond; and that too, haphazardly.
We, then, complained to the Inspector General of Prisons. However,
he too washed his hands of the responsibility, saying that he was new
to the job, did not know the precedents, and hence, could not act on
our complaint. The _Bagaicha_ Research Team, then, decided to do a
sociological sample study of Under-Trial Prisoners (UTPs) who were
out of jail on bail but who still run to the courts for every date of
hearing where no trial-hearing takes place but instead they only get
the next date!

The research team consisted of _Bagaicha_ staff and some UTPs. The
sample study took six months to complete. The Team met 102 UTPs
in their own homes in 18 of Jharkhand's 24 districts. The Research
Report was published in October 2016 under the title: '_Deprived of
their rights over natural resources, the impoverished Adivasis find prison_'. The
study brought to light some startling facts:

(1) Of the 102 persons
interviewed; only three admitted that they had any relation with
any _naxal_/_Maoist_ groups. That means, 97% of those jailed
as _naxal_-suspects are likely to be innocent. Can there be a greater
injustice done to the hapless _Adivasis_/_Dalits_?
(2) The proportion of
_Adivasis_ and _Dalits_ to those of general categories was far higher than
that found in the general population;
(3) Most of them were picked
up by the police either from their homes or from buses/trains on the
way to the market/town, thus disproving the police version that they
were captured in the forests as they were trying to flee;
(4) Two-thirds
of them were in the age-group of 18--35, just the age when a young
man becomes an active member of the community, settles down in
life, marries with his wife and has small children, and most of all is the
sole or main breadwinner of the family. By being suddenly plucked
away and thrown into jail, the whole family is irreparably affected, and
often their small assets of land/cattle either sold or mortgaged. In
short, several families have been reduced to destitution;
(5) Most of
them did not even know why they were arrested until charge sheets
were filed and they saw to their horror that they were implicated in
too many legal clauses; and it would take years before they can come
out clean from all the litigations. In other words, their family lives
have been ruined permanently;
(6) 'Bail is a right of the prisoner',
but who will bail them out? Even if the court grants bail, one has to
look for 'bailers' and lawyers to pursue the case; all this costs several
thousand rupees which is far above their capacity. Hence, most of
them, their families and communities, have been suffering in silence.
Their small children grow up without paternal love and care.

The _Bagaicha_ Research Team felt that having found out the truth, we
had to act on it. The only way of doing this was to take recourse to legal
action. After consulting several legal professionals, a Public Interest
Litigation (PIL) was filed in the Jharkhand High Court towards the
end of 2017. The PIL got admitted in January 2018, with Stan Swamy
listed as the main petitioner. The Chief Justice, even as he admitted
the case, directed the state to furnish all the required information
about all the UTPs in Jharkhand. It is now one-and-a-half years
and Jharkhand state is yet to submit the complete details of all the
prisoners. All kinds of excuses have been proffered before the court.
Some eminent lawyers have offered to argue the case. However, the
case has not come to the argumentation stage yet, since we do not
have all the required information about all the UTPs of Jharkhand.

Our prayer before the HC is:

(1) that all UTPs in Jharkhand jails be
released on personal bond since they cannot afford regular bond;
(2) that their trial-process be speeded up with the certainty that most
of them will be acquitted;
(3) that a judicial commission be appointed
to find out and rectify the inordinate delay leading to so much human
suffering and denial of their human and constitutional rights;
(4) that
the police officers who deliberately and illegally arrested them be given
exemplary punishment;
(5) that a just and adequate compensation be
paid to the families of those acquitted. We have been hoping against
hope that justice will be done to the unjustly imprisoned Under-Trials.

We feel that this PIL, of which I am the main Petitioner, has become
a thorn in the flesh of the state government since it takes to task
the state for its deliberate persecution of _Adivasis_ and _Dalits_. The
state, in this case, has much to hide. Hence, the Jharkhand police,
in connivance with the Pune police, are trying to get me out of the
way by implicating me in a faraway Bhima-Koregaon case. Additional
reasons for such implication will be detailed in the following pages.

The real purpose is to irreparably maim _Adivasi_ and _Dalit_ communities
by incapacitating the younger generation. Even if they manage to get
bail, they would be running to the courts for years. They would have
spent their limited resources and would be forced to move out of
their homes/villages/communities just to eke out a living as casual/
contract labourers. Their small children will be growing up without
paternal love and care. Their strong community-bond and their
community-based culture will dissipate. The onslaught on their land,
forest, despite so-called 'protective laws', would continue unabated all
in the name of 'national development'. If there is strong resistance
against land alienation and consequent displacement, the 'law of
eminent domain' of the state would be liberally used. It is a well laid
out plan to extinguish the _Adivasi_ (indigenous) and _Dalit_ peoples as
distinct social groups asserting their special constitutional and human
rights.

It is, hence, all the more important that this case, on behalf of the
thousands of Under-Trial Prisoners, be fought till justice is done.
Some eminent lawyers have offered to argue the case in Jharkhand
High Court when it comes to the argument-stage. But the state is
doing all it can to see that it does not reach that stage.

It's a long road to freedom!
