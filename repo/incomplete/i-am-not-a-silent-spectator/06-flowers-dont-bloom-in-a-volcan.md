_The laws and policies in favour of Adivasis remain mere showpieces, unimplemented_

\ 

My 30-year journey with the _Adivasi_ societies of central India started
with an eye-opening insight into their life when I lived for nearly
two years in an interior _Ho_ Adivasi village in Singhbhum district of
Jharkhand. Alone to begin with, and later with concerned friends,
I enjoyed _Adivasi_ hospitality. I learnt their _Ho_ language and spent a
lot of time with the youth, most of whom could not have education
beyond primary or middle school-level. Their socio-cultural values of
equality, primacy of community over family and individual, mutual
co-operation, readiness to share without counting, closeness to
nature and the practice of consensus decision-making came as new
revelations to me and my friends. I realised more than ever how the
present capitalist order stands in direct contrast to Indigenous values
insofar as inequality is the hallmark of success in life, cut-throat
competition is the order of the day, sharing is a bad word, individual
achievement is the ultimate goal and majority versus minority is the
sign of democracy.

But rude shock awaited me when I saw how unscrupulous
outsider-traders exploited and cheated the simple _Adivasi_ villagers
when they went to local markets/bazaars to exchange their forest
produce for items they needed such as clothing and household utensils.
Even ruder was the shock to witness how government bureaucrats at
every level looked down upon _Adivasis_ and treated them with scant
regard bordering contempt.

I took a square look at myself and asked myself if I should not
commit the rest of my life for the cause of _Adivasi_ societies in such
a way that my life would make even a little bit of difference in their
search/struggle for self-respect and dignity.

## The Laws in favour of the _Adivasi_ are mere showpieces not meant to be implemented

I started to study the different laws enacted in favour of the _Adivasi_:

A saying goes like this: "Written laws are like a spider-web; it will
trap the poor and the weak, but it will be torn to pieces by the rich
and powerful." That, in short, has been the story of the indigenous
_Adivasi_ societies in our country. True, some laws have been enacted
apparently in favour of _Adivasis_, however, simultaneously, enough
loop-holes are provided so that these laws do not take effect. It will
be my task to establish this truth in the following pages.

### The Plight of _Adivasis_ as observed by the Supreme Court of India

Let us start with what the Supreme Court of India has to say about
_Adivasis_ (India's indigenous people). In a recent path-breaking
judgment concerning the humiliation of a young _Adivasi_ woman by
the so-called "upper caste" people, the Court had observed:

>Despite all our tremendous diversity, the Constitution gives equal
>respect to all communities, sects, lingual and ethnic groups, etc., in
>the country. The Constitution guarantees to all citizens freedom of
>speech (Article 19), freedom of religion (Article 25), equality (Articles
>14 to 17), liberty (Article 21), etc. However, giving formal equality
>to all groups or communities in India would not result in genuine
>equality. The historically disadvantaged groups must be given special
>protection and help so that they can be uplifted from their poverty and
>low social status. It is for this reason that special provisions have been
>made in our Constitution in Articles 15(4), 15(5), 16(4), 16(4A), 46,
>etc., for the upliftment of these groups. Among these disadvantaged
>groups, the most disadvantaged and marginalized in India are the
>_Adivasis_ (STs), who, as already mentioned, are the descendants of the
>original inhabitants of India, and are the most marginalized and living
>in terrible poverty with high rates of illiteracy, disease, early mortality
>etc. Hence, it is the duty of all people who love our country to see that
>no harm is done to the Scheduled Tribes and that they are given all
>help to bring them up in their economic and social status, since they
>have been victimized for thousands of years by terrible oppression
>and atrocities. The mentality of our countrymen towards these tribals
>must change, and they must be given the respect they deserve as the
>original inhabitants of India.
>
>The injustice done to the tribal people of India is a shameful chapter
>in our country's history. The tribals were called 'rakshas' (demons),
>'asuras', and what not. They were slaughtered in large numbers, and
>the survivors and their descendants were degraded, humiliated, and
>all kinds of atrocities inflicted on them for centuries. They were
>deprived of their lands, and pushed into forests and hills where they
>eke out a miserable existence of poverty, illiteracy, disease, etc. And
>now efforts are being made by some people to deprive them even of
>their forest and hill land where they are living, and the forest produce
>on which they survive.[^/3]

### A brief historical outline of _Adivasi_ societies' deprivation

After 1947, the '_Adivasis_' came to be known as 'Scheduled Tribes.'
Since Independence, one-fourth of their population got displaced in
large numbers in the name of national development. The alienation
of their land has been estimated as some 22 lakh acres. Their forests
and mineral resources have been taken away from them.[^/4]

[^/4]: _Cf._ Swamy, Stan, 'Flowers don't bloom in a Volcano': Story of
the _Adivasi_ societies of Jharkhand, Sevartham: 37 (2012), pp.
83--102.

Two types of policies were followed by the Indian Capitalist
Ruling Class. Between the year 1950 and 1975, the policy followed
by the Government might be summarized as 'From Ethnicity to
Developmentalism.' People were told that what they needed was to
forget about their ethnic aspirations. Instead, they should develop
themselves economically. All kinds of schemes/projects were drawn
up and a lot of money was spent. However, the real beneficiaries
of such spending were non-_Adivasi_ businessmen, contractors and
bureaucrats. _Adivasi_ societies slowly began to realise how they were
being cheated.

From the year 1975 up to now, the policy followed can be summarized
as 'From Developmentalism to Regionalism.' Having failed the people
in terms of development, the ruling class began telling them that they
can develop themselves better if they have more autonomy, first as a
region (Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council). Having failed in that
too, promises of development were made in the name of a separate
state (Jharkhand state). We shall now take the state of Jharkhand for
further analysis.

What to expect of the state of Jharkhand in the future? During
2014--2019, while being ruled by the BJP-combine, there were more
fears than hopes. It could turn out to have been ruled for the benefit
of the direct exploiters of Jharkhandi _Adivasi_ societies. Besides, as the
government represented the Hindutva forces on the social front and
capitalist class at the economic front, there were systematic efforts to
polarize _Adivasi_ society on the one hand and exploit the rich mineral
resources on the other. Assimilation of Jharkhandi _Adivasis_ into
the capitalist mainstream could be the overall thrust. The mineral
and forest resources would be very much desired. Whereas _Adivasi_
societies, beneath whose feet are all these resources, would not be
desired. If their land and resources are taken away from them, _Adivasi_
societies, as culturally distinct social groups, would gradually vanish.
Those who are left behind might be made into landless wage-labourers
as it has already been happening. Many of them would be forced to go
out of Jharkhand to other states, far and near, as migrant labourers.
This would be the reality if Jharkhandi _Adivasis_/Moolvasis/_Dalits_,
if they fail to emerge as a strong united force to assert their rights and
device ways and means, not just to survive but to thrive as a united
political force.

In short, Jharkhandi _Adivasis_' history can be described as --- original
masters of Land and Nature --- people of communitarian ownership
and use of land through _khuntkatti_ system --- tenants in a feudal
tributary state --- individual _pattadars_ in a capitalist order --- and lastly,
deprived of land and other sources of sustenance, landless wage
labourers.

### Constitutional and legal protection to _Adivasis_ and the Reality

#### The V^th^ Schedule of the Indian Constitution[^/5]

[^/5]: Indian Constitution, Article 244 (1).

The V^th^ Schedule of the Indian Constitution clearly stipulates that
a 'Tribes Advisory Council' (TAC) should be composed solely of
members from _Adivasi_ communities who will advise the Governor
of the state about any and everything concerning the protection,
well-being and development of the _Adivasi_ societies in the state.
The Governor is the constitutional custodian of _Adivasis_. He/she
can make laws to this effect on his/her own. He/she can also annul
any other law, enacted by the parliament or state assembly, always
keeping in mind the welfare of the _Adivasi_ societies. This provision
is applicable in the nine states of central India where _Adivasis_ form a
significant population.

Whereas the reality is that, in none of the states, during all these nearly
seven decades, has any state Governor ever used his/her constitutional
discretionary powers to reach out to the _Adivasi_ societies, proffering
the excuse that they have to work in harmony with the elected
Government of the concerned state. The meeting of the TAC takes
place rarely these days. It is convened and presided over by the Chief
Minister of the state. However, all these have been controlled by the
ruling party of the state. TAC has, thus, been reduced to a toothless
body. Verily, it is a constitutional fraud meted out to the _Adivasis_ of
the state.

#### The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989[^/6]

[^/6]: Act of Parliament, No. 33 of 1989.

This Act was enacted by Indian Parliament to forestall the increasing
atrocities on _Adivasis_ and _Dalits_ by non-ST/SC individuals/
organizations/government officials, etc. The intention of this Act was
good. Chapter II of the Act lists a detailed description of Offences
of Atrocities.

Whoever, not being a member of a Scheduled Caste or
a Scheduled Tribe:

i. forces a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe to
drink or eat any inedible or obnoxious substance;
ii. acts with intent to cause injury, insult or annoyance to any member
of a Scheduled Caste, or a Scheduled Tribe by dumping excreta,
waste matter, carcasses or any other obnoxious substance in his
premises or neighbourhood;
iii. forcibly removes clothes from the person of a member of a
Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe or parades him naked or
with painted face or body or commits any similar act which is
derogatory to human dignity;
iv. wrongfully occupies or cultivates any land owned by, or
allotted to, or notified by any competent authority to be
allotted to, a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled
Tribe or gets the land allotted to him transferred;
v. wrongfully dispossesses a member of a Scheduled Caste or a
Scheduled Tribe from his land or premises or interferes with the
enjoyment of his rights over any land, premises or water;
vi. compels or entices a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled
Tribe to do 'began' or other similar forms of forced or bonded
labour other than any compulsory service for public purposes
imposed by Government;
vii. forces or intimidates a member of a Scheduled Caste or a
Scheduled Tribe not to vote or to vote to a particular candidate
or to vote in a manner other than that provided by law;
viii. institutes false, malicious or vexatious suit or criminal or other
legal proceedings against a member of a Scheduled Caste or a
Scheduled Tribe;
ix. gives any false or frivolous information to any public servant
and thereby causes such public servant to use his lawful power
to the injury or annoyance of a member of a Scheduled Caste or
a Scheduled Tribe;
x. intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a
member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any place
within public view;
xi. assaults or uses force to any woman belonging to a Scheduled
Caste or a Scheduled Tribe with intent to dishonour or outrage
her modesty;
xii. being in a position to dominate the will of a woman belonging
to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe and uses that position
to exploit her sexually to which she would not have otherwise
agreed;
xiii. corrupts or fouls the water of any spring, reservoir or any other
source ordinarily used by members of the Scheduled Castes or
a Scheduled Tribes so as to render it less fit for the purpose for
which it is ordinarily used;
xiv. denies a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe any
customary rite of passage to a place of public resort or obstructs
such member so as to prevent him from using or having access
to a place of public resort to which other members of public or
any section thereof have a right to use or access to;
xv. forces or causes a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled
Tribe to leave his house, village or other place of residence;

shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be
less than six months but which may extend to five years and, with fine.

Whereas the reality is that, this Act remains significant by its
non-implementation. The cases lodged by the aggrieved STs/SCs
are few. Judicial verdicts through the judiciary, especially at the lower
levels of the judiciary, take years to come through. By that time, the
hurt feelings get numbed and life goes on somehow. The fact is that
very few guilty non-ST/SC individuals/organizations/government
officers have been punished.

#### The _Panchayats_ (Extension to Scheduled Areas) \[PESA\] Act, 1996 [^/7]

[^/7]: The PESA Act 1996, No: 40 of 1996.

The PESA Act is a fruit of _Adivasis_' and their political representatives'
long drawn disenchantment and struggle. For the first time, this Act
recognized the fact that the _Adivasi_ societies in India have had a
rich social and cultural tradition of self-governance. Hence, the
Act outlines the composition and functioning of a _Gram Sabha_
(village-assembly). The following powers have been proposed to be
given to _Gram Sabhas_:

i. Every _Gram Sabha_ shall be competent to safeguard and preserve
the traditions and customs of the people, their cultural identity,
community resources and the customary mode of dispute
resolution;
ii. Approve plans, programmes and projects for social and economic
development before such plans, programmes and projects are
taken up for implementation by the _Panchayat_ at village level;
iii. Be responsible for the identification of selection of persons as
beneficiaries under the poverty alleviation and other programmes;
iv. Certify the utilization of funds by the _Panchayat_ for plans,
programmes and projects;
v. Be consulted before making the acquisition of land in Scheduled
Areas for development projects and before resettling or
rehabilitating persons affected by such projects;
vi. Plan and manage minor water bodies;
vii. Permit prospective license of mining lease and recommend
grant of mining lease for minor minerals;
viii. Recommend grant of license for exploitation of major minerals
by auction;
ix. Enforce prohibition or to regulate or restrict the sale and
consumption of any intoxicant;
x. Ownership of minor forest produce;
xi. Prevent alienation of land and take appropriate action to restore
any unlawfully alienated land;
xii. Manage village markets;
xiii. Control money lending;
xiv. Control institutions and functionaries in all social sectors;
xv. Control local plans and resources including tribal sub-plans.

Whereas the reality is that, this Act of Parliament has deliberately
been left unimplemented in all the nine states with significant _Adivasi_
population. This implies that the capitalist ruling class does not want
_Adivasis_ to self-govern themselves.

#### The Samatha Judgment, 1991, of the Supreme Court[^/8]

[^/8]: Civil Appeal Nos: 4601--2 of 1997.

The Samatha Judgment (1997) of the Supreme Court came as a
huge relief to the _Adivasi_ societies in Scheduled Areas. It came at a
time when, consequent to the policy of globalization, liberalization,
marketization, and privatization, national and international corporate
houses started to invade _Adivasi_ areas in central India to mine the
mineral riches. The Government machinery was giving its full
cooperation to these companies. Any resistance by _Adivasis_ was put
down with an iron hand. In response to these acts of injustice, the
Supreme Court judgment was meant to provide some significant
safeguards for _Adivasis_. It enabled them to take control of the
excavation of minerals in their lands and to help them develop
themselves economically. The salient features of this judgement are:

Minerals to be exploited by tribals themselves either individually or
through cooperative societies with financial assistance of the state;

i. In the absence of total prohibition, the court laid down certain
duties and obligations to the lessee, as part of the project
expenditure;
ii. At least 20% of net profits as permanent fund for
development needs apart from reforestation and maintenance
of ecology;
iii. Transfer of land in Scheduled Area by way of lease to non
tribals, corporation aggregate, etc., stands prohibited to prevent
their exploitation in any form;
iv. Transfer of mining lease to non tribals, company, corporation
aggregate or partnership firm, etc. is unconstitutional, void and
inoperative. State instrumentalities like APMDC stand excluded
from prohibition;
v. Renewal of lease is fresh grant of lease and therefore, any such
renewal stands prohibited;
vi. In states where there are no acts which provide for total
prohibition of mining leases of land in Scheduled Areas,
Committee of Secretaries and State Cabinet Sub Committees
should be constituted and decisions taken thereafter;
vii. Conference of all Chief Ministers, Ministers holding the
concerned ministry, the Prime Minister, and concerned Central
Ministers should take a policy decision for a consistent scheme
throughout the country in respect of tribal lands.

Whereas the reality is that, consistent efforts have been made by the
state to ignore this verdict of the Supreme Court. Several cases have
been filed by affected communities, but the law of 'eminent domain'
of the colonial rulers is invoked to alienate _Adivasi_ land and to loot
the rich mineral resources from their ethno-territories.

#### Forest Rights Act, 2006[^/9]

[^/9]: Act of Parliament No: 2 of 2007.

_Jal, jangal, jamin_, as we know, are the basis of the economic life of _Adivasi_
societies. But globalization, marketization, and privatization geared
towards industrialization, are laying a ruthless blow to the economic
sustenance of the indigenous peoples. Of particular importance is
that their traditional rights to resources found in forest areas have
been systematically infringed upon over the decades. At long last,
the government had come to the realization that a historic injustice
had been done to _Adivasis_ and other traditional forest-dwellers. To
correct this anomaly, it enacted the Forest Rights Act, 2006. Some
important features of this Act are the following:

i. All _Adivasi_ families living in forests from before 13 December
2005 on and cultivating land in the forests. Each family will have
the right to own up to ten acres of land;
ii. Those other families who do not live in the forest but are
dependent on forest produce will also be entitled to ownership
of forest land;
iii. Claims can be made at two levels: individual ownership and
community ownership;
iv. They will have the right to enjoy the minor forest-produce such
as fruits, herbs etc.;
v. The respective _Gram Sabhas_ will scrutinize and approve the
claims and then forward the same to the Block/District-level
Forest Committees;
vi. This process of distribution of forest land will not be under the
purview of the Forest Department.

So far, so good! Whereas the reality is far from desirable. From
2006 to 2016, about 41 lakh applications for title-deeds were made
all over the country, of which 18 lakh were approved, three lakh held
in suspense and 20 lakh rejected. A few months ago, a bombshell
from the Supreme Court fell on forest-dwelling communities when
it ordered that all those families, whose petitions had been rejected,
should be evacuated from forests! The outburst from all across the
country was such that the honourable court agreed to review its own
judgment. What the final verdict will be is something to look forward
to.

#### Land Acquisition Act of 2013[^/10]

[^/10]: Act of Parliament No: 30 of 2013.

Displacement and land-alienation of _Adivasi_ societies has been and
continues to be a vexing problem. The colonial era 'Land Acquisition
Law' of 1894 was kept intact for more than a century, as a result of
which about six crore population was displaced for various projects
such as small and large dams, mines, infrastructure, industries, etc.
Of them, 40% were _Adivasis_. Only 25% of the total
displaced were resettled. Hardly a few were rehabilitated since that
involves social and cultural dimensions. People reached a state of
mind that enough was enough. In more and more organized ways,
they started to protest and resist displacement. It was this predicament
that forced the UPA II government to pass a fresh 'Land Acquisition
Law' of 2013 to replace the old colonial law. This law contains some
favourable elements for farmers in general and _Adivasi_ societies in
particular. Some of the provisions of the Law are:

i. The Act provides for land acquisition as well as rehabilitation
and resettlement;
ii. The process of acquisition involves a Social Impact Assessment
survey, a preliminary notification stating the intent for
acquisition, a declaration of acquisition, and compensation to
be given within a certain period;
iii. Rehabilitation and resettlement is to be provided to people
affected by the land acquisition. The displaced persons/
families/communities will first be rehabilitated with house,
water, electricity, schools, health centres etc. Only after that will
they be asked to move away from their original land/community.
In short, displacement only after rehabilitation;
iv. Compensation to the owners of the acquired land shall be four
times the market value in rural areas and twice that in urban
areas;
v. In case of acquisition of land for use by private companies,
consent of 80% of all land losers is required; in case
of public-private partnerships, consent of 70% of
landowners is required;
vi. Punishment through courts to government officers who violate
the law;
vii. Multi-crop agricultural land is not to be acquired at any cost;
viii. Land which has been acquired but not utilized for the said
purpose for a period of five years or more is to be returned to
the original landowner;
ix. When it comes to acquisition of _Adivasi_ land, as a general rule it
should not be acquired. And in case of utmost necessity only as
a last resort and with the consent of the _Gram Sabha_, the land
can be acquired.

The provisions of the Law are there. However, the reality is different.
After the promulgation of the Act, state governments rather reluctantly
began to initiate the process of its implementation. However, hardly
a year had passed when in mid-2014, the new party at the Centre
sabotaged the salient provisions of the Act. On the penultimate
day of 2014, they brought in a 'Land Acquisition Ordinance' which
bypassed the Parliament. It is obvious as to why the new dispensation
took recourse to such drastic action. The national and international
corporate houses, which had financed the election campaign of the
ruling party, were now asking for their pound of flesh. If the present
government would not oblige them, it could lead to the fall of the
government itself. Hence the compulsions from corporate houses
outweighed the government's obligation to the citizens of the country.

Some of the damaging elements of this divergent Land Acquisition
Act Amendment Ordinance 2014 are the following. Let us see them
in comparison with the original Land Acquisition Act of 2013:

i. Any registered private entity can acquire land as per the
Amendment Ordinance 2014; whereas in the original law
(Land Acquisition Act of 2013) only licensed companies can
legitimately acquire land;
ii. The 2013 Land Acquisition Act mandated a social-impact
assessment to be carried out by a neutral body of experts about
the ill-effects of the project in terms of water/air pollution,
destruction of water sources, soil erosion, despoliation of
greenery etc. If the negative aspects would prove overwhelming,
then that project should be cancelled. Sadly, the Amendment
Ordinance 2014 does away with such an assessment;
iii. Whereas the 2013 Act makes people's consent (70% for PPP
projects, and 80% for private companies) a necessary condition,
the 2014 Amendment leaves it out altogether;
iv. The Amendment authorizes compulsory acquisition even of
multi-crop agricultural land;
v. The punishment to be meted out to government functionaries
when they are found guilty is also done away with in the
Amendment;

The provision of the 2013 Act is that the land be returned to the
original owner, when an acquired piece of land is not used for the
purpose for which it was acquired within the time-limit of five years;
the 2014 Ordinance makes it open-ended.

Wholesale resistance to this Ordinance at the popular level as well as in
the legislature took place all over the country. Finally, the government
was forced to give up its efforts to amend the law. Thus, we see how
even when some meaningful steps are taken by the government, the
capitalist ruling class gears itself up to sabotage them. However,
the central government authorized the state governments to amend
the law at their discretion. The Jharkhand government grabbed this
opportunity to amend the law. But people have been resisting the
strong arm of the state.

#### 'Owner of the land is also the owner of sub-soil minerals': a matter of common sense

The Supreme Court of India, in a path-breaking judgment, has said:
"we are of the opinion that there is nothing in the law which declares
that all mineral wealth, sub-soil rights, vest in the state; on the other
hand, the ownership of sub-soil/mineral wealth should normally
follow the ownership of the land, unless the owner of the land is
deprived of the same by some valid process."[^/11]

[^/11]: Supreme Court: Civil Appeal No. 4549 of 2000.

A myth exploded: During all these years, the ruling class and the
Government had created a myth that sub-soil minerals belong to the
state. On that assumption, the state claimed its right to ownership as
well as the use of these minerals. Thousands of acres of land with
millions of tonnes of minerals was arbitrarily and forcefully acquired
by the state. Electricity was generated; rail-cum-road infrastructure
was created; and big dams and factories were built. All these were
named 'modern temples'. No one cared as to what the law had to
say on the matter. The Indian legislature, executive and judiciary did
not find it necessary to reflect on the matter. The centres of learning,
churning out intellectuals and professionals, never pondered on this
vexing question. India, the largest democracy in the world, had to wait
for well over 60 years to affirm that 'the owner of the land is also the
owner of the sub-soil minerals.'

The silent majority: when the all-powerful state and its machinery
posed the claim that the state is the automatic owner of all
minerals, the land-owning-farmers who are at the lowest rung
of the socio-economic ladder, also accepted it as an inevitable truth.
The tragic truth is that, although the farming sector, which engages
65% of the population in productive activities, has been kept at
the receiving end all these years. For one thing, the farmers and their
offspring are not as formally educated as the urban middle and upper
classes of society and hence they cannot put forward their natural
right over the sub-soil minerals. They have been the silent majority.

#### Provisions of the UN concerning ownership of minerals

The Indigenous _Adivasi_ societies have followed the common sense
law which says that the owner of the land is the owner also of the
sub-soil minerals. This has been reconfirmed by the United Nations
Organization. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples, adopted by General Assembly Resolution 61/295
on 13 September 2007, in Article 26, affirms:

i. Indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and
resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or
otherwise used or acquired;
ii. Indigenous peoples have the right to own, use, develop and
control the lands, territories and resources that they possess by
reason of traditional ownership or other traditional occupation
or use, as well as those which they have otherwise acquired;
iii. States shall give legal recognition and protection to these lands,
territories and resources. Such recognition shall be conducted
with due respect to the customs, traditions and land tenure
systems of the indigenous peoples concerned.[^/12]

[^/12]: Article 26 of the above-mentioned UN Charter.

Let us remember India is a signatory to the above UN Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Hence, India is morally bound
to honour these resolutions. Apart from its UN commitment, the
Indian Government has enacted some laws meant to safeguard its
indigenous peoples and their interests. The PESA Act 2006 clearly
asserts, "Every _Gram Sabha_ shall be competent to safeguard and
preserve the traditions and customs of the people, their cultural
identity, community resources and the customary mode of dispute
resolution."

This corresponds to the notion of indigenous territoriality elaborated
by ILO Convention No. 169 in which indigenous rights to property
extend to the natural resources that they use as part of their traditional
economies or which have cultural, spiritual or ceremonial uses. Article
15 (1) states: "The rights of the peoples concerned to the natural
resources pertaining to their lands shall be specially safeguarded.
These rights include the right of these peoples to participate in the
use, management and conservation of these resources."[^/13]

[^/13]: PESA Act 4(d), emphasis added.

The fact of the matter is rather different. "There are no indigenous
people in India," says the Government of India. This is a clear plot
in the actions of the government. It is evident from the fact that
on one hand, the government liberally signs the resolutions of UN
Conventions and on the other hand, it keeps denying that there are
indigenous peoples in the country. As such it feels it is not obliged
to abide by the decisions taken in the UN. It is a denial of the very
existence of about 10 crore _Adivasi_ people. Instead, they have been
put in the conveniently created Scheduled Tribes category and some
bits and bobs are thrown at them, most of which are eaten up on the
way by middlemen and government bureaucrats; and hence, do not
reach the deprived and deserving among them. Consequently, poverty
is deepening among _Adivasis_.

In the meantime, the rich minerals in _Adivasi_ lands are being looted
by the government and private companies. The Supreme Court
has declared 214 out of the 219 Coal-Blocks in the country illegal
and ordered their closure and levied a fine on them for their illegal
mining. But the central and state governments have found a way
out by re-allotting these illegal mines through auction to make it
look legal! A lot of assurances are given that _Adivasi_ land will not be
given to industrialists, yet at the same time, mines in Scheduled Areas
are being allotted to government and private companies. This is a
cheating game! Wolves in sheep's clothing!

To conclude this sub-section, we may say that, a time will come when
the farmer-land owners and _Adivasis_ will be sufficiently awakened,
strengthened and will tell the government and industrialists that
they are the natural owners of the minerals in their land; and if the
government and industrialists want these minerals, they will have to
buy them from them. Let us hope that time will come soon.

#### Laws concerning banned organizations and their implementation in predominantly _Adivasi_ regions

Lots of atrocities have been committed on _Adivasis_ in the name of the
fight against _Naxalism_. However, the laws speak a different language.
For example, a Supreme Court judgement says: Mere membership
of a banned organisation will not make a person a criminal unless
he resorts to violence or incites people to violence or creates public
disorder by violence or incitement to violence.[^/14] The Court rejected
the doctrine of 'guilt by association'. Mere membership in a banned

[^/14]: Supreme Court: Criminal Appeal No: 889 of 2007.

The law is clear. However, the reality is a different story. It is common
knowledge that many young men and women have been held in prison
on the suspicion of being "helpers of _Naxalites_". It is an easy label
that can be put on any one whom the police wants to catch. It does not
require any proof or witness. Let us keep in mind that many of those
arrested are not even members of any _Naxalite_ outfit. The Supreme
Court says that mere membership in a banned organisation does not
make a person a criminal. After a person's arrest, other penal clauses
are added on him/her too. How far removed are the law and order
forces from the judiciary! Even if there is a modicum of humanity
left with the government and the police, these young men and women
should be set free. The important question is: under which law or
penal code are the police and para-military forces arresting young
men and women as part of their anti-_naxal_ operations? It is very clear
that they have not been abiding by the Supreme Court ruling. As such,
they should be sued for contempt of court.

To get bail is a right of the prisoner... but who will bail them out?
Getting bail is not within the reach of most under-trial prisoners.
For one thing, the lower courts consistently refuse to grant a bail to
anyone accused of being a _Naxalite_. This means that the prisoner has
to approach the High Court, and sometimes the Supreme Court to get
bail. The second factor is the expenses involved. An average expense
at the level of the High Court is between ten to twenty thousand
rupees. How many rural _Adivasi_ families can afford this expense?

In fact, most families are not even in a position to allow them to come
to the jail to meet their dear ones. At the same time, the government
does not reach out to them by providing free legal aid. In short, the
several hundreds of _Adivasi_/_Dalit_ under-trial prisoners in Jharkhand
alone are condemned to languish in jail for years to come. It is
important to remember that of those who have been arrested under
UAPA and CL-17 as part of 'Operation Green Hunt,' (one of the
anti-_naxal_ operations so named by the state functionaries), there has
not been even a single conviction. We can be sure that when the trial
would take place, most of them might be acquitted. Regrettably, there
has not been any time limit within which the trial has to take place.
Again, the _Adivasis_ are the victims. Justice delayed is justice denied.

A point of serious concern is that when the rights of people are
denied outright and wholesale, at least we know where we stand. But
when constitutional/legal/judicial rights are given by one hand and
surreptitiously taken away by the other hand, it is a deceptive game
being played by the powers that be on the life of those deprived people
who have a right to enjoy these rights. Are they to wait indefinitely
hoping against hope?
