# To be released if and when I'm arrested

FROM trying to free innocent Under-Trial Prisoners TO myself
being made an Under-Trial Prisoner

\ 

\[a protest & a resolve\]

\ 

This is to inform one and all that from the moment I am arrested,
I will stop eating and drinking (including water). That will bring a
speedy end to my bodily life. I humbly request that my dead body
be handed over to the nearest medical college/hospital for medical
research and scientific study.

\ 

**And I desire that this action of mine be an expression of my
dissent to and protest against**

\ 

i. the increasing autocratic governance in our country diluting the
Indian Constitution of its democratic, secular, socialist character;
ii. the wanton selling of country's natural resources to preferred
corporate houses leaving the masses sink in ever deepening
poverty;
iii. the assault on free speech and expression leading to premeditated
arrests of authors, poets, lawyers, human rights defenders,
student leaders who are made to languish in jails accused under
draconian laws denying them even bail;
iv. the indiscriminate arrests of thousands of young _Adivasi_/
Moolvasi youth for asserting their constitutional, legal, judicial
rights and are made to rot in overcrowded jails awaiting trial;
v. the irrational, heartless, sudden imposition of 'lockdown',
declared without any planning, preparation causing indescribable
suffering to millions of migrant workers all in the name of
containing the deadly virus.

## Now, what is the 'crime' I'm supposed to have committed to warrant arrest?

During the past three decades, I have tried to identify myself with
the _Adivasi_ People and their struggle for a life of dignity and
self-respect. As a writer, I have tried to analyze the different issues
they are faced with. In this process, I have clearly expressed dissent
with several policies, laws enacted by the government in the light
of the Indian Constitution. I have questioned the validity, legality,
justness of several steps taken by the government and the ruling class.

1. **I have questioned the non-implementation of the 5 th
Schedule of the Constitution \[Indian Constitution, Article 244(1)\]** which clearly stipulates that a '_Tribes Advisory Council_'
(TAC) composed solely of members from the _Adivasi_
community who will advise the Governor of the State about
any and everything concerning the protection, well-being and
development of the _Adivasi_ people in the State.
2. **I have asked why the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled
Areas) Act \[PESA\],1996 \[No:40 of 1996\]** has been neatly
ignored which for the first time recognized the fact the _Adivasi_
communities in India have had a rich social and cultural tradition
of self-governance through the _Gram Sabha_.
3. **I have expressed disappointment at the silence of the
government on Samatha Judgment, 1997 of the Supreme
Court \[Civil Appeal Nos:4601--2 of 1997\]**. The judgment was
meant to provide some significant safeguards for the _Adivasis_
to control the excavation of minerals in their lands and to help
develop themselves economically.
4. **I have cried aloud at the half-hearted action of government
on Forest Rights Act, 2006**: \[Act of Parliament No:2 of 2007\]
meant to correct the historic injustice done to the _Adivasi_ and
other traditional forest-dwellers.
5. **I have queried why the government is unwilling to carry
out the SC order 'Owner of the land is also the owner of
sub-soil minerals.'** \[SC: Civil Appeal No 4549 of 2000\] and
continues auctioning coal-blocks to industrialists without a due
share to owners of the land.
6. **I have expressed my apprehension at the recently enacted
Amendment to 'Land Acquisition Act 2013' by Jharkhand
government which sounds a death-knell for _Adivasi_
Community.** This does away with the requirement for 'Social
Impact Assessment' and allows the government to give away
even agricultural and multi-crop land for non-agricultural
purposes.
7. **I have strongly disagreed with the setting up of 'Land
Bank' which I see as the most recent plot to annihilate the
_Adivasi_ people because it** claims that all 'gair-majurwa' land
('Commons') belong to the government and it is free to allot it
to anybody (read industrial houses) to set up their small and big
industries.
8. **I have challenged the indiscriminate arrest of thousands
of young _Adivasis_ and Moolvasis under the label of
'_naxals_' just because they question and resist unjust
land-alienation and displacement.** I've taken legal action
against the Jharkhand State by filing a PIL in the HC praying
that:

(i) all Under-Trial Prisoners (UTP) be released on bail on
personal bond,
(ii) speed up the trial process which surely will
acquit most of them,
(iii) appoint a judicial commission to probe
the reasons why the trial process is indefinitely being delayed,
(iv) the police submit all needed information about all UTPs to
the petitioner. It is now more than two years since the case was
admitted but the police are yet to provide all needed information
about all UTPs.

\ 

This, I believe, is the main reason why the State
is keen to put me out of the way. The most feasible way is to
implicate me in serious cases and stall the judicial process to give
justice to the poor innocent _Adivasis_.

\ 

Above are questions I have consistently raised.

\ 

If this makes me a 'desh drohi' deserving of life-sentence, then so
be it!

_Adivasi_ friends, Stan decided to become a prisoner of conscience)
