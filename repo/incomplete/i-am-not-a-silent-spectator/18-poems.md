On New Year

\ 

May the New Year

\ 

Bring a New Awakening

\ 

To all of us

\ 

May the new awakening

\ 

Light a New Flame

\ 

In our hearts

\ 

May the new flame

\ 

Help us discern Truth from untruth

\ 

And hold fast to truth

\ 

May Truth embolden us

\ 

To speak truth to power

\ 

And be ready to pay the price

\

## Light, Hope, Love --- The New Order

Light overpowering darkness

\ 

Hope replacing despair

\ 

Love winning over hate

\ 

Is the message of Jesus risen

\ 

Darkness, despair descended on me

\ 

At lower court declaring me complicit

\ 

Of waging war against the State

\ 

As such not deserving bail

\ 

And what was the evidence?

\ 

Some documents planted in my computer

\ 

Which were supposedly addressed to me

\ 

Something I myself was not in the know

\ 

My co-accused colleagues

\ 

Assured me this accusation is nothing new

\ 

They too have been accused similarly

\ 

I was thus consoled to be in their good company

\ 

But fight we will till the end

\ 

Not so much just to save our skin

\ 

But to speak truth to power

\ 

Counting all the while you all are with us in mind and heart.

## Prison life, a great leveller

Inside the daunting prison gates

\ 

All belongings taken away

\ 

But for the bare essentials

\ 

'You' comes first

\ 

'I' comes after

\ 

'We' is the air one breathes

\ 

Nothing is mine

\ 

Nothing is yours

\ 

Everything is ours

\ 

No leftover food thrown away

\ 

All shared with the birds of the air

\ 

They fly in, have their fill and happily fly out

\ 

Sorry to see so many young faces

\ 

Asked them: "Why are you here"?

\ 

They told it all, not mincing words

\ 

From each as per capacity

\ 

To each as per need

\ 

Is what socialism all about

\ 

Lo, this commonality is wrought by compulsion

\ 

If only all humans would embrace it freely and willingly

\ 

All would truly become children of Mother Earth

\
