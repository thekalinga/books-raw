# Why Truth has become so bitter, Dissent so unpalatable, Justice so out of reach?

_The harrowing experience of being filed an FIR, being issued 'arrest-warrant', being declared an 'absconder', being raided and personal belongings taken away._

\

At 4 pm on the 27 June 2019, my Jesuit confr√®res rushed into my
room and told me to pack my belongings. I asked them, "Why?" They
said, "There has been a report of your and four other Jharkhandi
activists' 'imminent arrest'." They come to know this from the local
police station. I was told that the police might land up at any time to
arrest me. My spontaneous reaction was, okay let them come and take
me, after all, have there not been thousands of _Adivasi_/_Dalit_ youth
languishing in the jails of Jharkhand with no succour reaching them.
But they prevailed over me saying that I/we might be able to help them
more effectively by staying outside of jail, to legally challenge unjust
police action, by pursuing the case we had already filed in Jharkhand
High Court. I very reluctantly agreed and put a few things into a
small bag without knowing where I would be going, for how long,
and who would be willing to take me in. The following day, I landed
up in Bangalore, where there were some friends/comrades who not
only received me but welcomed me warmly in their midst. Indian
Social Institute, Bangalore had been the epicentre of my initiation
into Marxian tools of social analysis decades ago. As such it was
kind of home-coming for me. Quickly, I got in touch with those old
comrades who have endured hard times but consistently kept up their
commitment for the cause of the deprived and marginalized people
of our society. It was exhilarating to meet them, share our experiences
of past decades, assess the present socio-political dynamics; always
looking for allies with whose solidarity we can push forward.

This search led me to different places in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and
Karnataka, meeting people in small and big groups. All were eager to
understand the situation in the tribal belts of Central-Eastern India,
as they had been seeing so many young men and women from these
states doing odd jobs; especially, big numbers in construction work
sites, a few at small hotels, and many at embroidery units and working
in agricultural fields. Their predicament is elaborately described in my
write-up 'In search of a livelihood ...' elsewhere in this booklet.

Grieved as my friends and comrades were to hear the tragic tales from
the states of origin of these 'migrant workers', my socially-concerned
friends asked me how they could help them as long as they are in their
midst. I suggested and prayed to them that they take some time out to
meet and talk to them wherever they see them. This would certainly
help these young men and women to realize that, at least some people
in the south are humanely concerned about them and their wellbeing.
Sure, one cannot do much as individuals. I proposed to them that
they can form some groups and meet the migrant workers in their
places of work and living. This will enable them to know whether
the migrant workers get at least the minimum wage, understand their
living conditions, the availability or non-availability of health services
when they get ill/sick, and if they face any harassment from their
employers, contractors, middle-men, and so on. I persuaded my
friends, once they had got to know the actualities, to take significant
issues to the general public through local print/electronic media
and to take up specific cases of exploitation/cheating with relevant
government officers and public personalities. All my friends assured
me that they would do whatever they could. This is a little solace in
the face of the enormous difficulties the migrant labourers are facing.

## Multiple police cases, including 'sedition', chasing me

How can a comment on social media (Facebook), which the Supreme
Court has declared a part of 'freedom of thought and expression'
(Article 19, 21 of Indian Constitution), be made out to be a case of
'sedition' is beyond comprehension. I had made two comments
on Facebook, when in mid-2018, the state government was
harassing the _Adivasis_ of Khunti district for their assertion
of right to self-governance as per the constitution and PESA Act.
People were beaten up, houses raided, cases filed on 11,200 unnamed
persons and 109 named persons including tribal village heads. They
were all accused of sedition. Seeing this, I felt I could not keep quiet.
So I, through social media, reminded the Jharkhand government
of the suggestion already made by the then Union Home Minister:
"Where _Pathalgadi_ is taking place, let Jharkhand government enter into
a dialogue with them to find out why they are doing this". In addition,
in an interview to electronic media, I quoted the three-time M.P. of
Khunti, an _Adivasi_ himself, who had said: "If real development
of _Adivasis_ had taken place, _Pathalgadi_ problem would not have
risen at all." I had written on my Facebook page that the state
government might do well to go to the people and have dialogue
with them. What was wrong in doing this on my Facebook page and
how it amounts to sedition is beyond my comprehension. But the
hard fact is: I, together with 19 other writers, journalists and human
rights activists were booked for 'sedition'! The legal experts whom we
consulted on the matter told us that the government really has no case
and that it should not have even taken this issue to the court. And it
was left at that. No affidavits or charge sheets were filed by the state.

Alas, a good one-and-a-half year later, suddenly the Khunti police
approached the lower court and got an order to arrest just five out
of the 20 of us. My name was 17^th^ in the original list, but I was made
number one in the 'arrest-warrant'. _Is there not a well-designed plot behind
this?_

Unfortunately, the Jharkhand police proclaimed in court that I was
an 'absconder' and was evading arrest. That was far from the
truth. _I was not absconding_. Moreover, my physical absence, did not, in
any way, impinge upon the court proceedings. Even if a modicum of
truth would be acknowledged, the HC should have quashed the FIR.

Alas, the last blow came towards the end of October 2019, when the
Jharkhand police raided my residence and took away all my personal
belongings. A ray of light came to shine insofar as the new Jharkhand
government, within hours of taking office (in December 2019), held
its first cabinet meet and decided to withdraw all cases related to the
_Pathalgadi_ movement and the agitations against the amendments to the
Chotanagpur and _Santhal Pargana Tenancy Acts_. Although the decision
was announced, its implementation through judicial process is yet to
take place (as of mid-March 2020).

The _Bhima-Koregaon case has been haunting me and some eminent legal
professionals, authors, poets, cultural artists and human rights activists_. As
mentioned earlier, the case is actually a plot by powerful Hindutva
forces to save the embarrassment of its leaders who incited communal
violence against the _Dalit_ community as they celebrated their annual
festival _Elgar Parishad_ on 1 January 2018 at Bhima-Koregaon. Initially,
a case was registered with Pune rural police against two Hindutva
leaders. However, it was left in cold-storage and instead, a follower of
one of the two accused, filed a 'complaint case' with the Pune urban
police accusing the above-mentioned intellectuals of instigating the
_Dalits_ to violence. Consequently, a witch-hunt was launched. Nine
of these well-known and committed activists and writers were sent
to Pune jail, two others got interim relief from court, and I am still a
'suspect.' I've been raided twice by Pune urban police, who have been
looking for ways to implicate me.

Where will this all lead to, will there be an end to this harassment; and
when will that 'end' come? It is hard even to guess. But even now,
irreparable damage has been done to all the accused and incarcerated:
their reputed standing in society has been seriously affected; their
financial assets have dwindled, thus, severely affecting their respective
families; even after more than a year in jail, the nine accused are
being denied bail; the clients of the lawyers, the reading public of the
authors and poets, the marginalized and deprived people in various
people's movements and organizations who were helped by human
rights activists, and the audiences which were inspired by the cultural
artists, are painfully missing their presence in our midst.

Will, at least, the highest court of the land uncover the truth and
expose the malignant conspiracy of Hindutva forces and thus come
to our rescue? This is the flickering hope that is still being nurtured.
A sparkle of light has come from the new State Government
of Maharashtra, when it announced that it would withdraw the
Bhima-Koregaon-related cases. Announcement by government has
been made. However, the judicial process is yet to begin.
