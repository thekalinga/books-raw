# Silent footsteps that no one wants to hear

__Adivasi/Dalit youth migrating to southern states in search of a way out of economic poverty and social insecurity_

\

Migration is the silent footsteps of a people, searching for sources of
livelihood. The rest of society does not want to hear these silent steps.
Our present concern is with _Adivasi_ and _Dalit_ men and women
migrating to the southern Indian states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu
and Karnataka. We will discuss the following:

(1) the main trends;
(2) the reasons why; and
(3) the hardships they endure.

## The main trends

There are three types of migration waves taking place in the
predominantly _Adivasi_ states of Central-Eastern India:

The **first** is
the migration of young _Adivasi_ women to metropolitan cities. The
reason is that, there is nothing at home to occupy themselves with, in
a profitable and meaningful way. After the yearly mono-crop paddy
is harvested in their tiny plots of land, they find it would suffice to
feed them only for a few months. So instead of sitting at home idling
and starving, it is better for them to go to a town or a city; to work as
domestic help in urban middle class households to earn some money
for self and family. So they get in touch with middlemen/women
and take off, sometimes without even informing and getting the
consent of their parents. They land up in cities completely unaware
of city-life. Who would their employers be? What would be the nature
of work, amount of remuneration, living condition, etc.? Some of
them never come back, some being sold off to brothels, and some
others might be forcibly married to elderly men in northern states.
A sizeable number of them do keep in touch with their families and
send some money regularly or keep it and come home with a lump
sum amount. Sadly, many of them face a social boycott by the village
community insofar as, they are considered polluted by outsiders to the
point that getting married locally and settling down becomes difficult.

The **second** wave is the migration of entire families to northern
states. June to December is the monsoon-fed agricultural season in
the central-eastern states of India. However, the food produced is
insufficient to feed the family for the whole year; and in most villages,
irrigation facilities for a second crop have not been developed. Land
dispossession, state repression against resistance to displacement,
and mining and industrialisation that use _Adivasis_, mostly as cheap
labourers, only are further factors. As a result, between December
and June each year, tens of thousands of _Adivasi_ families leave their
hearths and homes to temporarily find work in construction sites,
brick-kilns and so on. Only some elderly members are left behind to
care for the cattle. The government ignores this annual exodus.

The **third** wave is the recent exodus of _Adivasi_/_Dalit_ youth to
southern states as casual or contract labourers. Hundreds of
thousands are residing in Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. They go
there, either through contacts or friends, who have already been there.
Often, they are taken in batches by contractors/middlemen. Kerala
alone has about 35 lakh (3.5 million), and Tamil Nadu 10 lakh (one
million). They are employed, for the great part, in construction (roads,
buildings, etc.) works, whereas smaller numbers are also employed in
other small industries, hotels, agriculture and as domestic helps.[^/15]

[^/15]: The numbers mentioned are based on rough estimates done
by organisations and activists working with migrant workers in
soothers states. It has been difficult to get the exact numbers due
the floating nature of migrant workers as many of them come
seasonally and keep moving from one location to another.

## The reasons: Why?

How to explain and understand this recent phenomenon of
migration to southern states? There are two main reasons. The first
is **deepening poverty**: while the Indian economy is said to be
growing at the fastest rate, poverty is deepening in rural remote
_Adivasi_ belts of Central-Eastern India. During the past two years, at
least 21 members of _Adivasi_/_Dalit_ societies have died of starvation
in Jharkhand, which the government refuses to accept as 'starvation
deaths'. On the contrary, the state machinery attributes their death
to some disease or illness. Nature has blessed _Adivasi_ regions with
tremendous natural and mineral wealth, which has now become a
cause of their curse. The Indian state, controlled and directed by
the corporate sector, is bent upon excavating the mineral wealth at
all cost. The protective constitutional provisions, laws, policies and
judicial verdicts meant to protect _Adivasi_, have been thrown to the
winds. Meagre cash compensation for their land is thrown at them,
while they are forced to vacate their hearths and homes. Hence, the
younger generation of these societies look elsewhere for survival,
and the southern Indian states seem to offer some limited chances in
terms of contract/casual labour.

The second reason relates to **resistance to the processes of
dispossession and simultaneous increase in state repression**. The
exploited people are reaching a point of saying 'enough is enough'. The
_Pathalgadi_ movement is a telling example. Resistance movements that
spring up against the unjust, illegal, forcible acquisition of _jal, jangal,
jamin_ have always found an echo among the people at large, reflected
in the formation of umbrella-organisations against displacement,
violation of their right to food, denial of civic rights, exploitation
of women and children, trafficking of young women, and unjust
measures like _land bank_, which take away community rights over
'commons'. The resistance of affected people, thus, receives solidarity
and support from human rights groups, several _Adivasi_-organisations,
leftist/socialist forces, some Jharkhandi _Adivasi_ parties, concerned
intellectuals and some legal professionals. However, proportionate
to people's resistance, the state's repressive interventions have also
been increasing. A small state like Jharkhand has several hundreds
of young men and women in its prisons accused as _Maoists_/_Naxals_.
Any young man/woman who openly expresses dissent to what the
state is doing can be labelled as a '_Naxal_' and thrown into jail. It is
becoming increasingly difficult for a young man to live peacefully in
his village: either he would be approached by local _Naxals_ to join
them; if he declines to join them, he might be liable to be beaten
up or eliminated by labelling him as a 'police informer'; or the
police would pounce on him sooner or later calling him a '_Naxal_'
or '_Naxal_-sympathizer/helper' to be picked up and thrown behind
bars. This precarious situation causes many young men to want to get
away from such situations of insecurity, at least for a while, and to try
and earn something for his family. Hence, they come to the southern
states of India in waves.

## The hardships they endure

Those young people, migrating to the southern states, hail from the
central-eastern Indian states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha,
Bengal, northern state of Bihar and the north-eastern state of
Assam. Leaving aside Bihar, all the other states are predominantly
populated by indigenous _Adivasis_. They have their own culture,
tradition, ways of agriculture, intimate relation to nature and
forest, strong community-identity, unique world-view, and their own
cherished languages. When they come to the south, they are abruptly
thrown into a very different world which contrasts with their own in
numerous aspects. And this 'other world' does not look upon them
kindly either; it looks at them with indifference and apathy, if not
outright animosity. Yet, these migrants have to put up with all these
alienating factors and continue to pursue their one single goal of
earning some money for the welfare of their families back home.

Some concerned individuals, organisations and institutions have
come forward to reach out to the migrants, often filling the vacuum
left by the respective state governments which, though having the
statutory obligation to look after these people, in reality fail to do so.
Some sample studies have been done which cover the various aspects
of the migrants' life, their working and living conditions, the language
barriers, their efforts to socially integrate themselves into the society
wherever they are, remuneration in terms of just/unjust wages, the
extent to which they are actually able to help their families back home,
and their expectations with regard to their future.

An article titled '_Adivasi youth migration from central and eastern states to
south India: opportunities and challenges_'[^/16] sums up the findings of six case
studies conducted in the southern states. It brings out the following
points of concern:

central and eastern states to south India: opportunities and
challenges' published in Social Action, vol.69, April-June 2019,
New Delhi.

i. Exclusion of migrant _Adivasi_ youth from benefits: Physically
isolated from the surrounding communities, it is difficult for them
to find out the local wage rates, and rights and support systems
available to them. They are excluded from government schemes
to varying degrees, from formal residency rights, documents to
prove their identity, political representation, adequate housing,
financial services, public distribution system, membership in
trade unions, public health facilities, education and other basic
amenities such as water and sanitation.
ii. Exploitation of migrant _Adivasi_ youth: _Adivasi_ women, especially
those working in garment factories, undergo high levels of
sexual harassment, verbal abuse and humiliation. Factory hostels
deprive women and girl workers of their rights to privacy and
liberty. Most _Adivasi_ youth suffer from low wages, long working
hours and lack of safety measures; they have often been made to
take up more difficult, hazardous and menial jobs compared to
local workers.
iii. Xenophobia and migrant _Adivasi_ youth suspected as _Maoists_:
Dislike of foreigners, a sentiment influencing the general public,
makes the local population conclude that migrant _Adivasis_ are
_Maoists_ and as such, one should keep away from them. There
are instances where they easily become suspects when some
theft takes place in the neighbourhood.
iv. Bonded labourers among migrant _Adivasi_ youth: The
intermediaries often exploit the helplessness of _Adivasi_ youth
by giving certain advance payments and forcing them and their
families into a kind of bondage or trafficking. Those, thus,
trapped are forced to work 12--16 hours a day with very little
or no wages. There are reported cases of bonded labour in
Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh.
v. _Adivasi_ girls trafficked: The traffickers are often agents of
sex-rackets who literally buy girls from their parents and sell
them to brothels at handsome rates. Media reports in Karnataka
state once reported, 150 such trafficked and bonded girls from
just one agency. Who and how many such agencies are operating
has still not come to light. A heart-rending situation.
vi. Accidents and loss of lives: They are vulnerable to health
hazards and infectious diseases as their working and living
conditions are deplorable. Lack of access to health care takes
a heavy toll. Housing conditions are appalling as they are made
to live in hovels alongside heaps of filth and mud. No proper
arrangements for toilet, drainage, ventilation or provision of
clean drinking water are made. Owing to these factors, they are
highly prone to accidents and deaths. When accidents occur
leading to serious injury or death, they are denied rightful
compensation. A newspaper reported that in 2013, in Kerala,
at least 50 dead bodies of migrant workers were brought to
hospitals for post-mortem every month. One consoling fact, is
the construction of long tenement houses with basic amenities
for migrant workers by the present government of Kerala. Will
this fine example be emulated by the other states?

Back in the year 2000, when the Union Home Minister introduced
the Bill in Parliament for the creation of the states of Jharkhand,
Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand, he solemnly announced that these
states were being established so that the Indigenous _Adivasi_ societies
will be able to self-govern themselves as per their traditions and culture.
It was also hoped that they would have a real say and a meaningful
share in the mineral wealth being exploited in their land. However,
what actually came to be was just the opposite. Multitudes of outsiders
from neighbouring states poured in, took over all trade related and
commercial activities, filled up most state government's high and
low bureaucracy, and the law-and-order forces became replete with
unsympathetic non-_Adivasis_/_Dalit_. The giant corporate houses came
marching in with full patronage of the central and state governments
to plunder the natural and mineral wealth of predominantly _Adivasi_
ethno-territories. The Indigenous people felt let down and cheated.
Most of their own political leaders, instead of standing up for their
cause, sold themselves off to power and money, some even joining
hands with rightist Hindutva forces/parties to work directly against
their own people.

Such is the predicament that forces the _Adivasi_ youth to migrate in
their thousands to the southern states. The above-mentioned six
concerns point to serious violations of _Adivasis_' and _Dalits_' labour,
human and constitutional rights. This gives a clarion call to all
civic-minded individuals, groups, organisations, institutions, people's
movements, trade unions and political parties to make concerted
efforts to ensure human, constitutional rights and labour rights to the
Indigenous _Adivasi_/_Dalit_ migrant youth, wherever they may be.
