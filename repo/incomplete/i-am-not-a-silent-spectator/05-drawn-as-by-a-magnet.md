The Indigenous _Adivasi_ societies, blessed with abundant natural
resources but unjustly deprived of them by the powers that be and
reduced to poverty and powerlessness.

Hailing from Tamil Nadu and having become a Jesuit, I searched for
a place and people to whom I could be of greater help. With the help
of some friends, I came to know of the indigenous, _Adivasi_ societies
in central India --- a place where despite its tremendous natural wealth,
the people were very poor.

I arrived in the district of Singhbhum and was assigned to teach in an
_Adivasi_ boys' high school. I wanted to learn more about my students,
and so I spent my holidays with them --- going from one village to
another, meeting people, speaking to them and getting to know them.

In one such village, I was staying at a student's home. It was a mango
season. One morning, we were sitting in their courtyard, under a
mango tree laden with fruits. My student's father pointed to a few
branches of the tree and asked his son to bring down the ripe fruits.
The boy did as he was told, and we enjoyed some of the fruits
together. But my attention was drawn to one particular branch of
the tree, which was still laden with ripe mangoes. The boy's father
had not asked him to pluck any fruit from that branch, and I thought
that perhaps he had failed to notice it. So, I pointed to the branch and
said, "There are plenty of ripe fruits on this branch. Why didn't you
ask your son to pick those too?" He responded very simply, saying,
"Those are fruits for the birds of the air. Nature has given freely, and
so we share freely." This incident forced me to question my value
system.

Later, I lived nearly two years in an interior _Adivasi_ village of the _Ho_
tribe --- learning their language, understanding their life, economy and
social setup. I, then, went for further studies and returned to work
at the Indian Social Institute in Bangalore after which I returned to
Jharkhand and its _Adivasi_ societies in 1991.

## What have I been doing in Jharkhand for the past several years?

I've been involved in the emergence of some of the people's
movements that Jharkhand has witnessed over the last few decades.
One of the main issues we see is that people are being displaced
because they live on lands that are rich in mineral resources.

An _Adivasi_ will say, "_Jaan denge, par zameen nahi denge!_" (We will give our
lives but will not give our land!) However, it is not enough to say this.
Hence, I have been working with young _Adivasis_ to help them better
understand the dynamics of the society at large and develop strategies
to resist unjust displacement to save their lands.

A related issue is that young people who resist displacement of
their land or their villages are accused of being _Naxalites_ or
_Maoists_. They are thrown into jails. Since one can't really rely on the
information that is reported in the media, we decided to conduct a
study to understand the situation of under-trials in Jharkhand.

We visited 18 districts in the state and spoke to 102 alleged
_Naxalite_ Under-Trial Prisoners (UTPs). Ninety-seven % of
our respondents reiterated that they had not committed the crimes
attributed to them by the police. Our study made it clear that, in the
current system justice is beyond the means of most of those who have
been falsely accused. Once they have been implicated in these cases,
the threat of persecution in the form of harassment, intimidation
or re-arrest persists even after accused persons are released on bail.
The study also exposed the deliberate misuse of criminal justice
procedures to repress alleged _Naxalite_ under-trials in Jharkhand's jails.

We estimate that there are at least several hundred _Adivasis_ and _Dalits_
languishing in Jharkhand's jails; this is a large number of under-trials
for a small state. Furthermore, it isn't just enough to learn about
the reality of the situation. One has to act upon it as well. Hence, I
filed a PIL against the Government of Jharkhand in the High Court
of Jharkhand demanding the release of all under-trial prisoners on
personal bond and the speeding up of the trial process. Consequently,
the High Court ordered the state to furnish all the relevant information
regarding UTPs from each and every jail in Jharkhand in January 2018.

It is now more than a year and the state is yet to provide the needed
information about UTPs. There have been several hearings. Each
time, the state would say that one or two UTPs have been released.
But we have not received the information that we seek; and this is so,
because the state has much to hide.

## Where does the support for peoples' movements come from?

These movements have primarily been driven and supported by
_Adivasi_ communities themselves. Let me give you an example. In the
1990s, the government wanted to construct two large dams across
the Koel and Karo rivers of Ranchi district. This project would have
submerged 132 villages, 30,000 acres of agricultural land and 20,000
acres of forest land. Naturally, people opposed this.

The entire community organised itself under their traditional
leadership. They took out massive rallies, walking for hours on
end from village to village to organise the community against the
construction of these dams. They conducted _aam-sabhas_ (community
meetings) in the 1990s. It is very interesting and instructive to know
how these crusaders of the anti-displacement movement organise the
community. Well, there's a particular beat of the drum that conveys a
perceived threat to the community. When one village plays this beat,
the neighbouring village hears it and repeats the same beat. This would
then heard by the next village and within a few hours, they would
have conveyed the message to all affected villages. And on the very
next day, the community would gather, and each person would have
brought with them _ek mukki chawal aur ek rupya_ (a handful of rice and
one rupee) as a contribution. This has been how the _Adivasi_ villagers
emerge together to advance a common cause and the community
supports itself to resist displacement. They normally neither ask for
nor accept any financial help from outside.

The Koel--Karo anti-displacement movement reached a climax on
2 February 2001, when the police opened fire at an _aam-sabha_ in the
village of Tapkara, where 5,000 people had gathered. Eight people
were killed and many more were injured and made permanently
handicapped. The state thought that this would frighten the _Adivasis_
into abandoning their movement. On the contrary, it had the opposite
effect --- people said we've shed our blood; there was nothing more to
lose and the movement became stronger.

## Can it be said that things have been changing as a new wave of younger Adivasis comes to the fore?

There are many young _Adivasis_ who have been educated and have
good jobs, have built a house in Ranchi and send their children to
English medium schools. However, most of them have severed ties
with the villages they come from.

Many of those who have stayed back in the villages cannot stand up
to and resist unjust displacement and dispossession. If they do, they
are put in jail. Hence, it has always been a difficult choice for them.
The young men say, "I cannot bear to stay back in the village and see
my land being taken away. However, if I resist, I will be thrown into
the jail. Let me instead leave this place, go elsewhere and earn some
money for my family."

This leads us to another situation: labour migration. Many young
_Adivasis_ are migrating, especially towards the southern states of the
country. One of the main reasons for such large-scale migration
is due to land and resources dispossession. Despite the fact that
Jharkhand had protective laws meant to safeguard _Adivasi_ land rights,
such as, the Land Acquisition Act of 2013, for the entire country
and the Chotanagpur and _Santhal Pargana Tenancy Acts_, specifically for
Jharkhandis, a great deal of forcible land acquisition has taken place.
When the youth stand up against forced land dispossession, they are
putting themselves at risk of being arrested and imprisonment for
years without trial.

## But the young are still resisting

When one's land and home are forcibly taken away, is anyone going
to sit quietly? One would definitely stand up and resist. There is
resistance. However, it has not been organised in such a way that
the entire community stands up to protect its constitutional and
human rights. The sociocultural distinctiveness of an _Adivasi_ society
emerges from the specific mode of production it has devised for
centuries based on its land, forest and other natural resources within
its ethno-territory. If a community is dispossessed of these resources,
its continued existence as a distinctive social group would certainly be
in danger.

Hence, we have created the _Visthapan Virodhi Jan Vikas
Andolan_, a people's movement against displacement.[^/2] While we have
successfully fought some cases through people's mobilisation, we
have also failed in others, because of the brutal repression of the
state.

[^/2]: I am a co-founder of this movement.

There are others who are doing this too; many good leaders have
emerged among them. Take the case of Dayamani Barla. She is from
the Munda _Adivasi_ group and has played a heroic role in leading the
community in the fight for people's land rights. When Arcelor Mittal
wanted to set up a steel plant in Gumla--Khunti districts of Jharkhand
state, the state government wrote off 12,000 acres of land without
any consultation with the inhabitants of that land. Dayamani went
from village to village, creating awareness about what was happening
and leading campaigns against the displacement of _Adivasis_ from
their land.

When Arcelor Mittal realised that they could not acquire the land
forcibly, they tried other means to hoodwink the people. Several fully
equipped, brand new ambulances with doctors and nurses started
making their way to these villages to offer free health services. The
community knew exactly why this was happening. It sent them back
packed. This is a very telling move for poor people who are in dire
need of health services. Finally, Arcelor Mittal tried to negotiate them
down from 12,000 acres to 800 acres. But the people refused to give
them even an inch of land and eventfully, Mittal had to leave the place.
