# There surely is a difference between Capitalism and Socialism

_An experience of enslaving capitalism and liberating socialism_

\

It was 1989 and I was doing a month-long study on the Economy of
East Asian countries in a research institute in Hong Kong (HK).
Hong Kong, as we know, is the meeting place of the international
capitalist market. A British colony, but China claiming political
control. The shopping centres, the malls and luxury hotels all spoke of
flourishing trade transactions, and millions of tourists were pouring
in from all over the world. Indeed, an example for all other countries
to follow. Old was not gold, rather all the new, latest models of
consumerist items were the appealing forces. The American dollar
was the most wanted currency; at every turn of the street you
would have 'dollar-exchangers' running after you to change the
dollars in your pocket into local HK dollars at competitive rates.

As I walked through a park early one morning, a silly thing happened.
The pin of the chain of my old watch gave way and the watch swung
off from my hand and fell on the ground with a thudding sound.
I picked up the watch and saw that it was still running. So it was
a question of merely getting that small pin fixed so that I could
wear the watch. Later in the afternoon while returning to my living
quarters, I walked into a glittering Watch and Clock Shop where
watches/clocks of every possible brand were exhibited in a very
attractive fashion. I approached the person at the counter, pulled out
my old watch from my pocket, showed him how the pin had given
way and asked him to replace the pin so that I could wear my watch.
He looked at me with disdain and said curtly "we don't do such things
in HK ... old watches are not repaired ... new watches are available in
plenty". When I told him my watch was in good condition, only the
chain had come off, he pointed to the door and asked me not to
waste his time! So, I walked out of the glittering shop saying to
myself 'this is the true face of capitalism'.

After a few days, I had the chance to go to China along with a Chinese
friend. We went to Guang Shou city (the name has since changed),
one of south-east China's large cities. I tried to meet ordinary people
in the lower rungs of the economic ladder with the desire to know
how they were making a living. Let it be remembered that, 1989 was
at the far end of Chinese socialism, just before it would bow to the
onslaught of capitalism. Every adult was employed, wages were low
even compared to Indian standards, but yet every family had a modest
house, the education of their child (one-child norm was in vogue)
was taken care of by the state from the age of three, all members
of the family enjoyed free health services, public transport facilities
were adequate, men and women went to their work-place and back
mostly by bicycle, and the price for consumer items like clothes
and food-items were set according to the size of earnings. Life was
simple, hard and bereft of luxury.

When speaking to them, it was revealing to note that, ordinary Chinese
had no feelings of antipathy towards Indians. Rather, they said that
the Indian and Chinese governments were at loggerheads at the time,
but that the people had no problems with Indians.

Coming back to my broken watch-chain, my friend took me to a small
watch shop, bereft of any glamour, where old watches to be repaired
or sold were hanging by the dozens on the wall. A young lady was
busy fixing a watch, and when we showed her the broken chain, she
promptly opened the drawer, took out a new pin, fixed it deftly and
asked me to wear the watch. After I wore my old watch, I asked her
how much I should pay, but she shook her head with a broad smile
and said, "_But you are our guest. We do not charge our guests_". I was not quite
prepared for this small, simple but magnanimous gesture. I thanked
her with a bow, and she responded with an even broader smile! As my
friend and I took leave of her, I thought to myself 'how endearing is
this glimpse of socialism'!

Do we now see the difference between the two?
