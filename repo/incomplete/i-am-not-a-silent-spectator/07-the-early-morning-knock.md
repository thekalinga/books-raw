# The early morning knock

_The Bhima-Koregaon imbroglio to conceal the real guilty, create other phantoms_

\

At 6 am on the 28 August 2018, I heard loud footsteps outside
my room at _Bagaicha_. From the window, I saw that my two Jesuit
confrères were outside their rooms. On opening my door, I saw
standing in front of me a local police contingent of about 30 men
with rifles and _lathis_. A small group of eight persons in civil clothes
came forward. They introduced themselves as the Pune Police and
said they had come to raid my premises and search me. I asked for
a search-warrant and the chief produced a typed sheet. However, I
found it was typed in Marathi language. I told them that I do not
understand Marathi, and hence, need an English or Hindi translation
so that I could understand why they had come to search me. At this,
the officer said the translation could wait but that the search had to
be done right away; he brushed me aside and forcibly entered my
living-cum-work room. They spent three hours turning everything
upside down. I asked the officer why they were doing this to me.
He replied, "You are a 'suspect' in the Bhima-Koregaon case in Pune".
This shocked me because I have never been to Bhima-Koregaon in
all my life nor had I anything to do with what happened there on
1 January 2018. I noticed that one of them was writing something
all the time. They seized my laptop, mobile and sim card, some CDs
and some documents lying on my table. Then they asked me to sign a
hand-written document and I again found that it was in Marathi, and
thus refused to sign a document which I did not understand. They,
then, walked to the gate and were discussing and possibly contacting
their higher ups in Pune as to what to do. In the meantime, my two
Jesuit lawyers arrived and I told them also that I would not sign that
document. They, then, went to the Pune police officers to discuss
about it and eventually arrived at an understanding that the chief
officer would read the document sentence by sentence and give an
oral translation of it in Hindi. After that, I put my signature on it.
A handwritten Hindi translation of the same was made available to
me five days later and I found it was mostly an inventory of the items
they had seized from me during the raid.

Needless to say, not only my friends/comrades arrived to stand in
solidarity with me but also a large group of journalists and reporters
from both print and electronic media came to interview me. My
colleagues and I told them that I would issue a statement in the
afternoon which they could use.

Later in the day, we came to know that similar raids were conducted
by Pune police in different parts of the country against 11 other
intellectuals, lawyers, poets and social activists. Nine of them were
arrested and taken to Pune jail. Two of them managed to get bail in
their respective High Courts. I, the 12^th^ person, remain a 'suspect'
under investigation.

No restrictions with regard to my regular activities or movements or
contacts were imposed on me and my confrères and I carried on with
our activities as ever before. Some public-spirited lawyers offered to
fight my case in Bombay High Court wherein I challenged the FIR
against me. The presiding judge said that there is actually no case
against me as I am only a 'suspect' and not an 'accused' but at the
same time he authorized Pune police to continue its investigation on
me. If they would find anything incriminating under the Unlawful
Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), they can arrest me and go ahead
with legal procedure.

## The second raid-cum-search drama

Almost ten months later, at 7 am on the 12 June 2019, the Pune police
accompanied by about 30 local police arrived again at _Bagaicha_. This
time, they were led by the Asst. Police Commissioner of Pune. When
my Jesuit confrères and I asked him for the search warrant, he said,
"I, as the Commissioner, do not need any warrant from anybody." He
and his team of eight forcibly entered my living-cum-work room and
started rummaging through everything. The Commissioner did not
interrogate me, instead I persistently interrogated him. I asked him if
he was aware that the Pune police had searched me and seized several
items last August, and if they had found anything incriminating against
me. He said, "Yes." However, he refused to divulge what it was. I
then asked him, much to his annoyance, if torture is a part of police
investigation to which he sternly replied, "No." I then reminded him
that one of the nine persons, who were jailed in August 2018, was
indeed tortured during police custody. He asked for the name; I told
him the name and how he (a respected lawyer) was slapped continually
on his face and one slap hit and injured his eye to the extent that he
had to be taken to a hospital on the following day. The Commissioner
evaded my query and said that he would answer it in the court!

This time around they took away the hard disk from my computer
and some documents lying on my table. Although they did not seize
my mobile phone this time, their technician started to meddle with
it until I objected to it. The Commissioner wrote a note addressed
to me listing the seized items and informed me that they had sealed
my Gmail and Facebook accounts. They also directed me not to use
these accounts. They showed me the inventory and asked me to put
my signature on it. Seeing that it was in Marathi, I refused to do so.
The two witnesses, one of whom was brought from Pune, signed the
document. Finally, off they went.

In the meantime, several friends/comrades and my lawyers reached
_Bagaicha_ to stand in solidarity. There was also an unruly crowd of
journalists and reporters from both the print and electronic media
wanting to interview me. On the advice of my friends and lawyers,
I told them that this was the second time I was being raided and
searched and that I would cooperate in any legal inquiry. I also assured
them that I would prepare a statement on the day's happenings which
they would be able to avail in the afternoon from the internet. Such
was the day, when I faced the unique distinction of being raided twice
in a span of one year.

## What lies behind this Bhima-Koregaon episode?

Most concerned persons are intrigued by the Pune police action.
They have been asking, "What exactly happened at Bhima-Koregaon
and why have eminent writers, lawyers, poets and social activists, who
have given the most and best of their life for the cause of exploited
and marginalized people, been harassed to the extent of not even
getting bail even after one year of their incarceration?"

**The answer is simple... it is to hide and protect the real culprits
who, belonging to the so-called "high-castes" and upper classes,
are members of Hindutva forces which enjoy the patronage of
the present ruling BJP.**

_Elgar Parishad_ is a joyous festival celebrated by the _Dalit_ people of
Maharashtra and its neighbouring states every year to commemorate
their victory over the so-called "higher castes" in a battle some
200 years ago. It is, in other words, a victory celebration held every
year by the _Dalit_ people. Now, the 1 January 2018, happened to be the
200^th^ anniversary of the victory and therefore a much bigger gathering
of _Dalits_ from all over the country took place wherein prominent
judges, lawyers and writers participated. Some "high caste" leaders
felt it was going too far and decided that this surging enthusiasm of
_Dalits_ must be curbed. Hence, as the _Dalits_ were returning after the
celebration, some Hindutva leaders mobilised the Hindu community
and attacked them with lethal weapons, destroyed shops and forbade
even drinking water to the _Dalits_. The very next day (2 January
2018), some 22 FIRs were filed with the Pune rural police against the
Hindutva leaders who organised and carried out the violence. The
FIRs specifically mentioned the names of two persons. The police
swung into action and arrested one of the two who came out of jail
after a month. Whereas the other was never arrested. Now, both of
them roam about freely. If this case by the Pune rural police would
take its normal course, it would surely implicate the top two Hindutva
leaders. This could lead to an embarrassing situation for the ruling
BJP party. This would also question its profession of secularism and
questions will be raised about its "high-caste" bias.

So, a way had to be found to divert the nation's attention. Some alibi
had to be found. With a well-schemed plan, one of the followers of
one of the Hindutva leaders filed a complaint case with the Pune
urban police accusing prominent intellectuals, lawyers, poets,
and human rights defenders that they were responsible for the
_Elgar Parishad_ violence. The Pune urban police was activated to identify
and take legal actions against about 25 persons, of whom I happened
to be one. Five were arrested in June 2018 and in August, the same
year, another four were arrested. Some are said to be absconding.
Two managed to get anticipatory bail. My lone self is until now
only a 'suspect'. They probably could not find anything in the first
raid; hence, I was raided a second time. The plain fact is that all the
documents they seized during the two raids were already in the public
domain. However, they might still find some loophole to net me!

It is common knowledge that the lower levels of the judiciary,
all judicial officers and magistrates, are appointees of the state
government and hence, subjected to the dictates of the ruling
political class/party. Hence, no justice can be expected from them.
It is only the higher judiciary (the High Courts and the Supreme
Court) which have a certain independence in appointing judges which
might be expected to exercise their jurisprudence independently and
follow the dictates of their conscience. In the _Elgar Parishad_ case,
even the higher judiciary seems helpless to deliver justice, since the
police has placed before them a voluminous so-called 'evidence'
amounting to thousands of pages (in our case 5000 pages), leading to
the petrification/partial paralysis of the judiciary. Which judge would
find the time to intensely study 5000 pages of evidence just for one
case? The end result would be that bail might not be given even after
more than a year. When would a trial be commenced and when would
it end leading to acquittal or conviction? One thing is certain: Justice
delayed is justice denied.

## The REAL and the ALLEGED reasons for the FIR against me

My lawyers, colleagues and I believe that the **real reason** I have been
implicated in these cases might be the challenge I have posed to the
state in Jharkhand by the PIL I filed in the High Court of Jharkhand
on behalf of thousands of Under-Trial Prisoners (UTPs) languishing
in the jails of Jharkhand. The study on UTPs brought out the fact
that at least 90% of them are likely to be innocent. In this
context, several concerned social activists and lawyers from central
Indian states had given a call to each other to come together and chalk
out a way to come to the rescue of the thousands of UTPs in all four
central-eastern (Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and West Bengal)
states. We had come together towards the end of 2015 and had
formed an informal body called _Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee_
(PPSC). It is an open body with no formal membership but with the
resolve that we would collaborate with each other and have recourse
to legal action. I happen to be a co-convener of this body as well.

It is on the basis of the above study of under-trials that my PIL was
formulated. The state has much to hide; and hence, even after
one-and-a-half years, it is not placing all the relevant facts regarding
UTPs before the court. But I kept pressing on in every hearing. I
have, thus, become a thorn in the flesh of the state and it is intent on
getting me out of its way. The police force and those utilising them
are obliged to help each other and the Bhima-Koregaon case is a
convenient alibi to do that.

The alleged reason given by the Maharashtra police is that PPSC,
together with _Committee for Release of Political Prisoners and All India
Peoples Lawyers_, is a frontal organisation of the _Maoists_ and that
all these three organisations receive directives from _Maoists_
and are funded by them! Hence, as of now, the previously
alleged Bhima-Koregaon connections are not being placed before
the Bombay High Court. However, somersaults are being performed
to establish the nexus between these three organisations and _Maoists_.

The sober fact is that PPSC, of which I am a founder member and
a co-convener, is a spontaneously-formed body of some concerned
citizens of central-eastern India who intend to reach out to the
unjustly imprisoned _Adivasi_ and _Dalit_ youth. We meet as and when
we feel the need to do so. We receive no funds from anybody. The
expenses of board and lodge are met by mutual contributions, each
one contributing as per one's financial capacity and desire to do so.
We are accountable to each other and together we are accountable to
the _Adivasi_ and _Dalit_ peoples of central-eastern India.

This should put to rest all speculations and cooked-up accusations.
